[[Ranking my realistic chances of winning against yakuza protagonists ]]


I tried to be as close to reality as possible, and avoiding gameplay-only stuff (so for example, Saejima is matching a huge bear's strength, Majima can break walls with a punch, etc but they take the same damage from bullets as in cutscenes)

I'm a ~200lbs dude into fighting sports & I did some knife and gun training, not a pro in any of these but I do believe the weaker end of yakuza protagonists could be killed by bums like me

You could beat Haruka in a dance battle?
    Thats the real question
        I mean, you might be able to beat like Saejima in a dance battle, but other than that a dance battle would be a far worse massacre.
            With how good Kiryu and Majima are at disco, you're just going to look like a fool
    only if you're him

https://i.redd.it/7uje1mq4jawc1.gif
    No one can. Next to her, everyone's a basic bitch.
    I feel like she's kinda overrated dancing wise I would beat her in a matter of weeks if I trained for it. Akiyama would be 1000 times better at dancing realistically I would never surpass him. Haruka beats me at singing tho
        Yakuza fan with prep time
            I kinda can tbh, what are the characters gonna do ? Delete the games ?
        > I would beat her in a matter of weeks if I trained for it.

Not a hope: https://www.bu.edu/lernet/artemis/years/2017/projects/StudentWebsites/Michelle/pages/Kp.html

> The average training period for a trainee is 2 to 4 years.
            I'm saying she's a pretty bad dancer on stage so pulling some breakdance moves would be enough. She's a proper singer tho thats why I say I wouldnt even try to be better than her
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCWoUUWwdqg 

This is the expected standard of dancing in Kpop/Jpop you can go for it with the break dancing , but I'll admit it's pretty much considered one of THE if not the hardest choreos out there so I'll drop it down a notch or two...

How about this choreo?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcLvorudLfQ

Maybe this one instead? It works better if you've got the long hair for the hairography though

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBSt2ehzkm0

Don't forget you gotta be lip syncing to the song all the way through too...
                    I don't need to do allat, have you seen haruka dance ? Yagami takes on her all day long
                        Dragon engine does a *lot* of heavy lifting there my dude üòâ
                            Maybe, still I could dance better than her and you could to. I know a dude completely out of shape who only spend his time drinking and he has way better dance moves than her
                                No "maybe" about it.  PS3 hardware is almost 20 years old at this point, so the animations are severely limited in comparison.

Come back when they release a Kiwami for Y5.
Look at you, thinking unarmed Shinada is like a common thug.
    Shinada is no joke, don‚Äôt disrespect him like that. Ask the 6th chairman
    How to get stuck in My Meteor Tackle near wall StarterPack
    I think he's not pro-fighter level
        Are you pro-fighter level?
            This.

OP, if you haven't fought **at least** in a handful of amateur boxing matches/muay thai, I'm talking in a ring - sanctioned bout by your state, you ain't beating any of the people listed. Being a martial hobbyist ain't anywhere near Yakuza power levels, you best be posting gold hanging around your neck or waist.
            Amateur. An amateur can beat a pro at least once at out of ten times, at those levels luck is a heavy factor and style too, and Shinada isnt good at martial arts and gasses out, I think I can submit him considering I'm like 20lbs heavier than him and he doesnt know bjj or grappling
                You're amateur level and Shinada is a professional sportsman, his fighting style is the use of weapons AND could literally beat the shit out of an assassin 

Unless you shoot him in the face you don't have a chance against Shinada
                    Amateur fighter vs (former) professional baseball player. Because an amateur swimmer is expected to be worse at swimming than a professional golf player üëç great logic

Also let alone reading the post, you couldnt even read whats written next to shinada
                Shinada beat Daigo. I get that his role in the plots get memed on pretty often, but Daigo was a final boss for Kiryu and held his own for a decent chunk of time. You'd be delusional to think you could beat the guy who beat him if you aren't an experienced fighter.
                    Shinada didn't beat Daigo. Game makes it clear that Daigo was just testing him. Shinada literally faints post-fight
                    Shinada doesnt beat Daigo quite the opposite, and Daigo wasnt even a hard fight at all for Kiryu, you're delusional about them more than I might be about myself
                        + an amateur fighter means you already have years of training fighting sports so I take experience too
                Doesn't know grappling? Have you seen him do Hell's Floor?
                    Bro is grappling like he's in a RAW main event, I would't say he knows proper wrestling or bjj
        He beat a professional assassin 1v1 and is rip as hell, I think you are underselling his strenght. He is no Kiryu, Majima or Saejima, but he is still strong as hell.
            With weapons ! And Baba didnt have that dawg in him, bro was quitting his job anyway so you can say Shinada beat a jobless bald fucker at best. Being ripped as hell doesnt mean shit. Saying I'd only beat him once out of ten times is honestly giving him pro-fighter level credit
        yeah in terms of fighting skills, he doesn‚Äôt really have any but i think you forgot or at least underestimating his raw strength. A single raw amateur punch from him would realistically knock you out cold. I mean he even won against Daigo just because of his raw strength alone.
            Maybe, probably not. And no he didnt win against daigo
                damn, you‚Äôre really selling yourself high huh honestly even aside from the gameplay stuff shinada canonically fought and survived fights most wouldnt even come alive from. These characters aren‚Äôt meant to be realistic when it comes to it because they can fight against an army and win.

I‚Äôd lowkey argue you‚Äôd have more chance winning against Ichiban since he fights in parties so having to fight him solo would probably weaken him down a lot.
                    Not really, you're just overestimating raw strength with no technique for koing

Its hard to scale ichiban and he tanked a combined jima attack that I cant match with physical AP thats why I put him there. But I could maybe submit him idk
                        ehh if it‚Äôs irl average people/fighter I agree with you but these fictional characters‚Äô strength were never realistic to begin with. Even with gameplay aside, they can still be considered superhuman in what they have achieved, even Shinada. In that universe, seeing how he still won or survived against fighting skilled people while just relying on his raw strength, ill take my chances.
        Or at best low pro. Which I can beat once out of 10 times, if you're amateur level at fighting with a bit of random factors you could win a few fights against dudes way better than you, that happens a lot
You are NOT beating Shinada bro
    Yeah but HE NOT BEATING GOKU! NOBODY CAN BEAT GOKU! WHO YOU KNOW BEATING GOKU?
        Chi chi solos Goku
        Haruto stomps Goku, no contest
    But what if it's a no sex contest?
    Shinada fights like a dummass and relies heavily on weapon, I feel like an amateur fighter could take on him and tire him out at least once out of 10 times
        My guy, you're not beating Shinada. He's beaten multiple yakuza while outnumbered, and he's beaten Baba, who was an assassin. Not to mention, he qualified for the victory road tournament, which requires him to beat coliseum combatants in which many, if not all, are professional fighters
            You don't know OP bro once he sees red he's definitely winning 1/10 times.
                Wait till OP clenches their fist and talks about how no one wins alone, while a montage of all the people who impacted their life float across the screen.
                    Shinada is f-ed if that happens.
            I still think in a 1v1 he's not favorised against a pro fighter and could lose to me once in 10 fights. He also fought Baba with weapons

I didnt took the victory road tournament into account shit, but not most of them aren't pros tho. Still, beating a pro is possible for an amateur way more than once out of 10 times
                There's no indication he fought Baba with weapons outside of player choice. The fight even has 3 QTE's, and not once does shinada use a weapon. Instead, he uses his bare hands to counter and stop Baba. 

And don't forget he managed to beat both Komaki's in a 2v1 to limit break (I'd say both komaki's qualify has pros) 

Sure, in the world of yakuza, there are pros that could beat shinada (Tatsuya and Tendo, for example), but any real-life pros would simply not compare, Shinada being a fictional character has levels of strength, endurance and durability that no one in real life can match up to. Again, this is a man who beat multiple combatants at once while said combatants had guns, swords, bats, daggers, etc. (There's a reason pro fighters or trainers will tell you not to engage when faced with a weapon or overwhelming numbers unless absolutely necessary. The risk of death or serious injury is not worth it) 

TL;DR Shinada has beaten pros, and by being a fictional character, is simply stronger and faster than any real-life pro
                    Lorewise shinada is mainly using weapons and he has a dedicated moveset for them, just like majima with his knife. The reason they don't have weapons is because then they wouldve to force you to use the particular weapons or make qtes for all different types of weapons, which you shouldnt expect from RGG considering they avoid cost on stuff like that regularly, reusing assets etc

Mmh yeah if you consider the komaki stuff he'd nodiff me but I don't really took that and the arena into account since its not the story canon stuff
                        There's nothing that suggests that shinada used weapons for his fights outside of gameplay, and as you said yourself, you're trying to stay close to reality by  ignoring gameplay stuff. Well, in all of shinadas' dynamic sequences (which are required to progress), He doesn't use a weapon
                            Gameplay stuff doesnt matter however I think its heavily implied in the story and writing although I might be wrong and since I'm unsure I'm gonna stick to what I said before
                    "By being a fictional character he's simply stronger and faster than any pro" with that logic anybody in the yakuzaverse is bc theyre all fiction character, cool to learn sohei dojima & haruto would beat JJ & GSP in a tagteam fight
                        I meant fictional characters that fight on the regular
                            I fight more regularly than shinada. Bro doesnt fight outside of y5
        Bro does 5000 swings, 1000 pushups and 1000 sit ups everyday. You are losing
            Thats sub optimal training ü§ì

I do better regular training and tons of fighters do, the 1000 pushups part is quite impressive tho considering he's only 15lbs lighter than me
                you are still losing.
                    Nah I'd win
You aren't going to win against any of those protagonists lmfao even with a knife.
    You would think people gets it after spending most part of the game beating random thugs with knifes and swords
        Or even getting shot multiple times and just getting back up after being a little dazed. Or Kiryu brushing off multiple shaped charge rockets blowing up on his face. He face tanks that shit better than an actual tank

I mean, damn, Kiryu breaks Majima's arms on a pretty regular basis and the fucker still gets back up like nothing. They get their bones pulverized and still beat the everliving shit out of you. You ain't making it out in a physical state other than liquid
        Read the description I'm not talking gameplay where they can take Amon satellite lasers
            Random street fights canonically happen, Kiryu mentions it in a sub-story. There are a lot of scripted fights were the enemies have swords and guns and Kiryu canonically doesn't receive damage, so yeah.....
                Beating some thugs in the street is not out of reach at all, you can and I can do it. Fighting multiple people can be very easy when they're intoxicated, not prepared, not trained, not coordinated, and/or just dumb. If you have 3 serious dudes its a completely different world than 3 dudes in a nightclub
                    Did..... Did you played any Yakuza game at all?
                        All of them multiple times except rgg online, binary domain and another one.
                            Just in Yakuza 1 Kiryu manages to beat up a lot of Yakuza dudes with katanas
                                Ok, have you played yakuza 2, 3, 4, 6, and judgment / lost judgment ?
                                    I played until 2, but I just recently bought the remasters collection. I'm just waiting for it to install
    That's what I was thinking
    Kaito lost against a knife surprise attack, I think those 3 could lose to that. I might misjudge Ichiban tbh but Akiyama and Tanimura don't have an insane durability
        Ichiban survived getting shot in the tit. That at least says something about his durability tbf
            He was put out of commission thats like death, if a dude kos me I know he couldve killed me in my sleep and I'd have done nothing, same applies with ichiban getting shot
I could not beat Haruka in a dance battle. And my only chance against any of the rest of them is just running away. The smokers have to stop and catch their breath, so, that‚Äôs my chance to escape.
    You when you realize they spend enough CP and now they can sprint infinitely ü•≤
        CP??

    I was not talking about a dance battle üòÖ

Running away works for half of them, some of them arent even affected by smoking 10 packs a day
you aint beating shit lol
Ryoma has a gun too bro you ain‚Äôt winning
    Ryoma with sword and gun will win against any yakuza character, human or bulldozer it matters not, haha
    I forgot about that and put him there cuz I thought he wouldnt even know wtf that is... üíÄ although maybe I can beat him with a better gun (100% sure I have one) and a bulletproof vest (still relies on where he gon shoot me first). But I think I'm cooked for him too
        Even Miyamoto 2 centuries before Ryoma knew guns. 

They were very heavily used during the battles of the civil wars in the late 16th century. There was even a troop of women fighting with guns in battles.
            One hand guns ? Or just the big ones (forgot the english name, muskeeters ? Idk) ? Bc its fine if its just the big ones, a modern gun like a glock looks so different he wouldnt understand soon enough imo
        Man can parry bullets...
            In gameplay...
                The man fought a mutant bear and picked a man up by his face, then managed to throw him so hard he knocked over 10 people with that one guy.

Sorry, but... You ain't got a shot in hell, unless you sneak attack + headshot with a gun, but then what's the point.
                    And in what tier did I put him
                        I mean, you put Ryoma, the guy who parries bullets, who has displayed superhuman levels in terms of cutscenes in:
I could beat him if I had a gun levels
When this guy... Frankly he's a fucking animal in terms of strength and speed, beyond that of a human.
...
Your judgement ain't looking the best kid.
                            I said I put him in cooked (forgot he had a gun) 

Just look at ishin's end
                            "Kid" do you wear a fedora and smoke cigars ?
                                No, I think your the child of a female goat. Duh.
                                    ?
        Someone tried beating him with a better gun and it didn't end well for them
            Lets try an even better gun then
                Dude literally had the best gun from the time period made by western gunsmiths
                    At the time ü§ì

But that aside idk why you even arguing when I said I'd lose to ryoma as soon as I remembered he has a gun
Respectfully Shinada wooping your ass
    Nah I'd win
        Nah you gettin fuckin curbstomped lil bro
            Maybe 9 times. Not the 10th tho
U overestimate urself significantly big dawg ngl
    You either didnt read the post or don't remember what happened in those games brother
        No i read what you wrote plenty, and if you think any of thats enough it really aint.

If you have any fighting experience whatsoever then you should know that fighting a group of people who even sort of know what their doing gets your shit rocked 10/10. It doesnt matter if your mike tyson, if your against a group of decently sized, aggressive and angry men, your gonna get mobbed and stomped on. Shinada and co do that shit on a Wednesday.

And before you argue that oh its a video game and the enemies dont act like they would irl, how the hell are you meant to assess anything then in this tier list of yours? Its not like yakuza is known for being accurate fighting simulators, and judging by the fact that they fight through mobs that are armed to the teeth no problem, 200lbs and ‚Äú‚Äùsome‚Äù‚Äù fighting sports and gun/knife training is getting you about as far as a regular goon. 

These are fictional fighters, they are untouchable, and you thinking you can beat them to any capacity would be like me saying I can beat shinada cus I wrestle so I can surprise him by picking him up and dunking him onto his head. Makes no damn sense given how in setting, they fight far more and far meaner people that could ever exist irl.
            Fighting a group of person in yakuza is not the same as in real life. In kurohyou 2 & dead souls its pretty close to what actually happens tho

I'm basing myself on their statements and cinematic feats mostly
                I am aware dawg i even said dont bother arguing how its ‚ÄúnOt ReAlIsTiC‚Äù. No shit, its not, but sure lets say counting cinematography.

You only GET to those cinematic bits by fighting through the armies of men. Your ignoring that, cus that would automatically make it obvious you stand not a snowballs chance in hell against any of them. UFC Champion calibre fighters aint getting through half of what any of them went through in the gameplay youve chosen to completely ignore, which, btw, is like saying you can beat comic batman but like, only counting scenes where he had a broken back okay!!1!1!1!

But fine just cinemtography. Saejima, fought a mutant bear and lived. Saejima fought Baba and Baba didnt automatically die from Saejima laying his bear-beating hands on him. Shinada whooped Baba‚Äôs ass.

Regardless of how you look at it, again, your fucked, because again, these characters are fictional. They have feats and powers that a human being aint coming close to, much less someone who is ONLY the traits you describe.

What if they existed irl, surely you could beat Shinada right? Well what if the world was made of pudding, cus that doesnt matter. There is no way of scaling them that makes any sense other than being willfully ignorant of their superhuman bullshit that patently defies reality.
                    Sure, even top UFC fighters can't beat an army of men. But in Yakuza, an army aint shit. One strong dude is better than an army. We have to compromise between our and yakuza's world, and 1v1s in yakuza are much closer to reality than the group fights
                        There is no ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù man. Multiple scenes show these regular dudes that make up the armies regularly harass and beat up regular people, because they SCALE as regular people. They aren‚Äôt suddenly weaker, its the protags that are given fictional fighter roids. You need to understand the crux of why you stand no chance: they are fictional. Any compromise you make breaks the canon in the way that makes it so you might as well be just making up new characters in a new media your trying to measure your fighting prowess against. Willfully ignoring the main meat of the games, the gameplay I mean, that would make it so that they completely annihilate you as opposed to just annihilating you, or suddenly deciding that in the world of yakuza numbers don‚Äôt mean shit when, as per your rules, Majima in a CINEMATIC in Kiwami 2 was at deaths door after fighting the army of the Omi alliance, first of all don‚Äôt change anything cus you lose anyway, and second of all DON‚ÄôT MATTER because they are ubermensch. 

By any metric in the world, no matter what you choose to tunnel vision on, they were written to be exceptionally bullshit, and debating whether or not you could beat them rings the same sentiment debating if you could beat Ryu and Ken or Jin Kazama or whatever. You cant, because they are not physically in the realm of humans.
                            Aint reading all that big dog but I'm sure you made a great point üôè make a tldr pls
                                Lmaoo you don‚Äôt gotta be pretending to be all suave and shit, just stop replying if you got nothing more to say broski, no ones forcing youüòÜ
                                    Nah I legit didnt read we hearing each other and I got too many comments dawg
                    Saejima went easy on Baba and look at Shinada's face after beating Baba who didnt even want to fight lmao. On top of that realize Shinada was allowed all his weapons

With feats comes antifeats. Sure, kiryu can beat tigers, but he's vulnerable to knives and can die from anyone cutting him. Maybe against him if he had the will to kill me he'd do it before bleeding out, but that'd work on Kaito tier dudes. Its relative, maybe I could kill Kiryu like that hobo almost did, maybe I couldnt (as in he wouldnt fully bleed out before killing me after I cut him) which is what I think. Still stuff like that and other scenes proved you can beat them.

Ofc it doesnt matter its a dumb tierlist on reddit. And no I'm not ignoring their superhuman feats, if I was I wouldnt even have a cooked tier to begin with lmao
                        1. No amount of going easy on someone is going to stop them from being absolutely mangled by someone who fights bears. Also why does Shinada have weapons, I thought gameplay scenes don‚Äôt count and as far as I recall, he never uses any in a cutscene. Not that it matters, Mr. Baba is a battery victim from a guy that fought a mutant bear, no iron pipe is hurting him‚Ä¶unless again, Shinada is superhuman, which he absolutely is.

2. Antifeats are everywhere dude, they don‚Äôt suddenly make it so you have a shot. Yeah they can be ambushed, in which case‚Ä¶why bother with the hypothetical. Walk up behind them and shoot them. Kind of pointless then.

3. Yeah your right, it doesn‚Äôt matter, your a grown man you are allowed to be woefully wrong about something. I am also allowed to join in on the silly tier list and say, as per my original comment, you are massively overestimating yourself big dawg.
                            I aint saying I fight saejima tho. And yes, by going easy you have ufc fighters kicking and punching an average girl that interviews them, so saejima can hold back against baba and not fight the same as against a bear. Also baba aint getting stronger from that he doesnt have saiyan genes lmao

Antifeats give ways of beating them

Exactly, you're allowed to be wrong
                                1. UFC fighters dont compare. YOU dont compare. And btw, how exactly do you picture Babas fight with Saejima? Sure there wasnt a cinematic, but Baba aint a slouch. Was he just treating Baba like how UFC fighters were treating anchor girls? Pretty sure if Saejima were that strong, hed just‚Ä¶never struggle. But he does. Cus im not claiming Baba has zenkai, Im claiming he survived an ass whooping from a guy that beat a bear‚Ä¶cus he is also superhuman. You can read what ive been writing over and over, its all gucci, as many times as you need to understand.

2. Yeah, but in the context of what your talking about they mean nothing. Oh they can be ambushed‚Ä¶so then your only way of winning is by ambushing them‚Ä¶so then whats the point? Why bother with this ‚ÄúYakuza protags I could beat in a fight‚Äù? You already know the answer, based on your antifeats you can ambush em and win. But no, your claiming you can FIGHT them, and lemme tell you unless that ambush is a quick shot to the brain, you cant.

3. If what your gathering is that Im somehow wrong on the topic of if a dude on reddit can beat cartoon superheroes, thats okay, theres no penalty for believing in wrong things. Your allowed to make mistakes my man, your human‚Ä¶which is also why, again you dont stand a chance lmao.
                                    OP when Saejima just smacks him with a stop sign he tugged out the floor:
                                    Its just an example to say a strong dude can hold back, and the gap between saejima and baba is WAAAAY smaller than the gap between pereira or strickland and the girl interviewing them

The point is having more than 3 tiers and giving interesting alternatives

Cutscenes showed us they're just as vulnerable as us, if you can't see that thats on you
                        Kiryu's vulnerable to knives in the sense that he gets hit by a complete non-combatant like random homeless people. Every other time, he's able to just straight up react to whatever shit is thrown at him including bullets at several times. It's just a diff measurement of super human abilities (speed and reaction time).
                            Every other time except in y3 which is the only ever time it happens outside of gameplay (ugh maybe majima stabs him too but I dont remember that)
                What about Kurohyou 1?
                    In k1 enemies dont spam attack you at the same time so its like other yakuza games, groupfights still feel like 1v1
                        Yeah, I don't remember Kurohyou 1 that well, guess it's time to play it again
                            Finish it in ex-hard with ng+ (only game where I didnt do it by restarting completely, its way harder than the rest of the franchise lmao)
                                The Kurohyou games are ruthless
OP, you don't win against any of them.

\- shinada is fucking jacked and in excellent shape despite being poor

\- tanimura and akiyama defeated armies by themselves, you probably won't surprise them

\- ichiban is far tougher than you give him credit for; he's canonically fought LaD >!a tiger!<, IW >!a shark, and a giant squid!<.

\- yagami would disarm you before you could shoot him

and if you touch haruka you get a tiger drop from yours truly.
    also Ichiban fought bulldozer and fought several different crime organizations just because he want to have a chat with their boss
    That >!giant squid!< was a real son of a bitch too. Hardest damn boss fight in the game.
        i lost it when >!ichiban and chitose got swallowed!<
            >!It only ever went after Tomizawa for me lol. He must be traumatized after that.!<
        Man I was already level 69 when I got to it so it only got about 3 turns. I kinda trivialised the end of the game for myself by leveling up so much :')
        I went in underleveled and lost when he was one hit ;-; Then I learned you could stall by outhealing the stomach acid
        wong was harder and the squid wasnt bad at all tbh
    yep
    Ichibans feats become way less impressive when you realize he had a whole ass party fighting with him
        you still have to be pretty tough to make it out alive, and he's no slouch alone either
            Nah we'd make out and then I'd die
                lmao
            4 regular guys with weapons would beat a tiger provided they're not scared (which is the big "if")
    Er... so does Ichiban have his whole party with him?
    Shit, imagine how powerful Shinada would be if he was rich
    just because someone is jacked doesnt mean they fight well
        shinada does fight pretty well though, and being jacked certainly helps with that. he and akiyama >!held off the omi in the finale!<
            Also we forgetting he fought toe to toe with Daigo which was literally the final boss of the previous game.
    Being jacked isnt enough to beat a fighter, its not even his main strength his toughness is, and everybody is jacked in yakuza. Except tanimura and yagami lol

Surprise attacks have been working on the likes of Kiryu & Yagami who prolly fought more than Tanimura and Akiyam combined

I agree that I might underrate Ichiban especially since Yakuza 7 is the only one I haven't replayed on Legend, and I also haven't finished IW. However, you have to take into account that Ichiban fought that lion in a 4vs1 which is extremely easier than alone on top of having access to weapons (I shouldve precised everybody has to be unarmed except me & the samurais)

For Yagami, that's why I don't say I'm 100% winning. Despite knowing the basics of shooting someone he is good at pre-avoiding like Majima does. I also put the samurais there cuz musashi would be surprised by a gun and ryoma's gun is prolly nothing compared to recent ones
You are NEVER beating Shinada. This is the same guy that fought Daigo AND Baba. He has barely any fighting experience and still won.

But thank you for putting the GOAT, Ukyo Tatsuya in here (I love ikuzo kora guy).
    Daigo wasnt really going full at him, and Baba is just someone that loses to everybody he fought. I can count that as my feats since I sparred pro fighters and lost against them then lol. The thing is, Shinada lacking fighting experience is EXACTLY why I put him there separated from everybody else. I can pull a submission on him or tire him out outfighter boxer style

Ukyo Tatsuya goated, no chance in hell I do anything to him lmao
Shinada punched and launched DAIGO through a door, you're getting your ass beat bro sorry.
    I've had huge people bodyslam through the ground and a door aint shit, although with a punch its still a great feat. But fighting strength doesnt mean in a more technical fight you're gonna hold up just as good, and Shinada's lack of experience make him risk getting submitted imo
        It wasnt just "people", it was Daigo who is strong AF. I think you're vastly underestimating him.
            Doesnt matter who he did that to, its the same feat of being able to put someone through a door. He couldve done that to Yujiro or Kiryu it wouldve been the same feat for him, the only that wouldve changed is they wouldve taken 0 damage
you are not beating ryoma with a gun my guy, swordsman blocks bullets
    Not in cutscenes as he showed in the end game
        everybody's weak in cutscenes. 2, 5, 8, kiryu dies like every 3 games
            Weak no majima can still punch walls, kiryu beat tigers saejima a bear etc etc
                what does this even mean
                    Talking about cutscenes ? Are you acoustic bro
                        *autistic
                            Thats on purpose
                                ![gif](giphy|p58AvYUeCZJ62gL2WK)
                                    Its just a funny thing people say, idk why you're making it seem like not a lot of people do it. Are you restarted ?
                        your jumble of words does not make any sense
                            Aight just forget it then
Yagami isn't getting beaten with a gun he's the only character in the series to actually empty the mag and throw the gun away from the bad guy lol
    Actually, Joryu also disassembles the gun if you do it in Agent Style.
    Kuroiwa, and look at how Soma did Kaito and him
        yeah but you'll notice Yagami still beat Kuroiwa & Soma's asses lol
            Bro thinks he‚Äôs better than Kuroiwa and Soma. Lol
            Situational. Kuroiwa didnt have bullets bc of everyone else as long as he had bullets Yagami was hiding. Soma only attacked Kaito first bc he chosed to, not bc that wouldnt have worked on Yagami and the scene clearly indicated that on top of having Yagami almost getting pieced up by Soma at the beginning of their second fight
Have you SEEN Shinada‚Äòs Body?
    I'm heavier than him by about 20lbs, so, has he seen MY body ?
        ![gif](giphy|Y5Ii8PopcVCFy)
            Pov the body of people who think its impossible to beat tanimura or shinada in a fight
Shinada is gonna beat your ass he is still strong as hell unarmed, also I'm pretty sure Ryoma cut through a bullet before.
    W Jibanyan pfp
Dude, nobody in this entire subreddit is beating Shinada. Shinada,the weakest out of a cast of characters that fight up to ten people at once, that a level of Superhuman nobody can reach.
    Beating multiple people means nothing in this case. In a 1v1 you think he'd beat thor, tyson or JJ ? Kiryu would but not Shinada
        Yes, I'd say Shinada would beat Mike Tyson in a fight 1v1.  This is a guy who can have a whole glass dome fall on his head and walk it man, it doesn't matter how skilled you think you are, that skill isn't gonna matter to a guy going through a good number of people with Knifes, Guns, and by him fucking self.
            Aight then
Pfff I can take Goro Majima

Haruka is not easy money, if you hurt her you will need to fight against Kiryu
    I'm moving outside of Japan so he can't come to me... wait I forgot about IW
> and avoiding gameplay-only stuff (so for example, Saejima is matching a huge bear's strength, Majima can break walls with a punch, etc  

These are quite literally cutscenes and scripted sequences that activate in the game, even then my brother in Christ you're not beating any of them, all of them without exception have numerous cases of beating 5+ people at once, some of which may even be armed.

Shinada who you have at the very bottom is punching people hard enough to at the most generous possible assumption, [cripple normal humans](https://youtu.be/crSmaB2Scfw?si=T5kwxWwu-OK3XBhk&t=6) completely if not outright kill
    Also Y4 is full of a street battle quick time event when they gather a chance to react to being ‚Äòjumped‚Äô and usually parry the attack
    Crippling humans is normal for humans to do, it happens a lot
        \>Launching another human being through the air several metres with one punch is actually totally normal.
            Strawman much ? I'm saying crippling people. A random bum can do that to a random bum, so ofc Shinada does it too
                No it's literally what you're saying, when I said crippling I linked to an example of Shinada punching someone through the air looney tunes style

Though crippling is kinda generous, the force from that punch would put any normal human it hit in the head into quite the coma.
                    Nah I'm literally talking about crippling people in general. If I say the sky is blue you're gonna tell me "oh well you're saying there's never been a cloud ?", its just not the same thing talked about
                        Then you're just strawmanning what I'm saying...?
                            Kinda the opposite
                                No, you're fully just ignoring the actual evidence I was presenting to give context to my point and what I meant in terms of severity in the word cripple to just focus specifically on that word and ignore said evidence.

You're inventing a new argument to go at, that is the definition of strawmanning.
                                    Strawmanning is when I say "well, crippling a human is a basic human level feat" and you say "what you think punching someone meters away through a door is a basic human level feat ?"
    This is what I'm saying, I'm saying they're cutscenes. Can you read a full sentence ? Idk what you're trying to argue here
        Then what the hell is your point? This isn't which characters you could beat or whatever it's a vague list that then has practically nothing to do with the characters because you've just decided what they've shown apparently doesn't matter.

What are you even basing your rankings off then?
            If you read the full sentence you would see the point. Yk, the part where there's a "but" and I explain whats not taken into account lmao
                Then it's still nothing because it's you arbitrarily deciding what does and what doesn't count for the sake of putting your ego up a fictional character I guess lmao
                    No one is beating them gameplay wise bc guns arent guns, knives arent knives and they can just use glitches or use inventory items mid-fight. Very smart.
                        Cool...? That wasn't my point, it was that there was many, many non-gameplay instances of them that would be evidence to them ripping off a normal human's head.
                            Compromise between feats and antifeats is key
                                And that compromise is these characters are blatantly superhuman and have clearly been presented as since the very inception of the series.

What even is your "compromise" here?
                                    Their characters have been seen to be vulnerable enough times to assume they can be beaten without plot armor
Nah bro Yagami is cooking you just as bad as Kiryu. Dude is a master martial artist and can disarm you before you can even blink
    Bro was gonna get done by Kuroiwa if he didnt shot 1000 dudes before, and Soma couldve stabbed him instead of Kaito if he wanted to. Give me a gun and I'm betting my life on that W
Do you really think Haruka learned nothing from Kiryu fighting however many thugs in front of her?  I'll bet she would crush you, not in a fun way. This shit is all laughable
    Yeah haruka can probably beat a tiger too
The knife you stab Akiyama with will be magically blocked by a deus-ex machina stack of money
    Thats why I'm saying I aint sure of winning... no plot armor tho hopefully
The problem with beating hakura is not hakura herself, but rather the second phase
    When you beat the boss but the combat music doesn't stop.
        Rolling eyes fall..
    I mean, I just said I can beat her. What happens another issue... and even if somehow I beat Kiryu by pushing him off the Millenium Tower when he wasnt looking and he doesnt fall on rubber concrete, then I'd have the tojo dudes on me too, same with pretty much everyone here who's not friendless like shinada

(edit : yes shinada has friends but aside from Daigo, they aint trying anything)
Don't mess with us Yakuza fans, we're mentally ill.
Nah I'd win against Ryuji, he's about to be blinded with these Bontan pants I'm wearing to the fight
You can't just beat any of them even with a gun lmfao, I haven't played DS but I would argue that kiryu in that game has the same power as 4 or 5, hell you can't just pull off a surprise attack with a knife on either tanimura or ichiban who is aka the next "D≈çjima no ry≈´", even akiyama who >!spent almost a year running from saio traid beat the shit out of them whenever he was about to get caught!< (Y6 spoiler)

Realistically Yagami, shinada, Sakamoto and haruka can't be defeated, the fact that shinada >!has the same power as daigo!< (Y5) Makes you wanna reconsider your thoughts, and you are telling me you could win against haruka in a dance battle or beat her to death? Impossible.
    listen i love shinada and i 100% think op can‚Äôt beat him but shinada didn‚Äôt really beat daigo. he‚Äôs still standing after the fight, meanwhile shinada collapses from exhaustion. daigo saw how strong shinada‚Äôs resolve was and stood down.
        I said he has the same power as him, didn't say he beat him
    Akiyama lost to a downed Munakata Seishiro with a gun

Kaito got nodiff by Soma with 2 knives

Kiryu got nodiff by a hobo with a knife and then that dude from y3-4

Yagami almost died against Kuroiwa's gun which puts his friend out of commission

Ryoma got done by bullets against a much weaker dude

"You can't sneak on Ichiban because he's the next Dragon !" As if Kiryu didnt got sneak attacked and left for dead in y2 & 3

Yagami wouldve lost to Kuroiwa if Kuroiwa didnt use his bullets for 100 dudes & hoodie thief hot guy, and again, Kaito got done by a knife who is relative to Yagami, also Soma almost killed Yagami the same way

I could win a fight against haruka probably not a dance battle and definitely not a singing battle
        Akiyama didn't lose to munakata, if you watched the scene you would know what happened

Idk, still haven't reached that part yet

But the fact he can still stand normally two hours later, yeah maybe you wanna reconsider (this series has this weird logic with very strong protagonists so idk)

Haven't reached that yet

Haven't played ishin so can't really drop my thoughts

Again, ichiban can still stand normally like 38 year old kiryu, and kiryu himself managed to walk fine with some pain in Y2 (I don't really have a fucking clue what happened with Y3 kiryu)

a

"I could win a fight against haruka not a dance nor a sing battle" so what you gonna be a criminal or something?
            He got surprise shot by munakata and wouldve died if not for plot armor gag. That just means he wasnt on guard in the most important moment of his life atp, and I could sneak attack and kill him with a knife or gun. 

2 hours during which he couldve been killed very easily

"Kiryu managed to walk fine with some pain" naaaah thats crazy dude was dying and you had to reach the doc in a short notice before literally bleeding out and dying, on top of that he was barely walking

Pretty much every yakuza protagonist is a criminal somewhat, and saying I could beat a woman shouldnt be different than a man here considering in both cases you'd consider that assault & battery
Damn so you can hold your own in a battle quite well huh? I would probably lose extremely easily to all of them minus Haruka.
First off you seem to forget that Shinada doesn‚Äôt really fight people that seriously and when he did he tackled Daigo through a door and fought him to a stand still.

Second of all Akiyama, Ichiban and Tanimura have all fought people wielding guns and won, plus the yakuza characters have shown crazy reactions before so a 200lbs man attacking with a knife from an alley won‚Äôt fly.

Third, there‚Äôs 0 merit in sneak attacks or quick drawing someone with a gun
    I aint calling that a stand still bro, Daigo messing around like he's Kiryu

Akiyama got gundiff by Munakata, Kiryu got stab and almost died multiple times, I don't need to talk about the Judgment games

There's no chance in hell I'm risking fighting Yagami or a samurai without a gun
        Kiryu got stabbed once because he was in a bad head space by a person who was homeless or pretending to be and the second time because he reached his hand out to help someone turn their life around.

He got stabbed not because of lack of reflex but because of his trust in people, something Tanimura and Akiyama dont have as much of.

Also, iirc Munakata shot Akiyama AFTER he fought Arai as it was Arai‚Äôs gun that he grabbed so your point there means nothing unless you plan on hiring dudes to jump him first.

Shinada would tackle you into a a wall and fold you like a lawn chair the minute he thinks your trying to kill him, something Daigo wasn‚Äôt trying to do to him so you‚Äôre getting full force Shinada.

And again there‚Äôs no merit in saying you can kill these dudes in a sneak attack or with a gun, I‚Äôd respect you more if it was a tier list of how well/long you can fight these characters
            I'll just pretend I'm homeless to akiyama then. You think he doesnt trust people ? He got done by kido & arai, he let munakata his gun close to him, he gave millions to saejima's sister, he let haruka near park, he lends money to lots of people based on loose tests, shall I continue ?

Yeah Tanimura's different, but he's also way weaker. The only reason I wouldnt go unarmed against him is he'd submit me before I submit him in hand to hand combat, so with a gun I top his superior grappling game

It doesnt change that you can sneak attack akiyama and that he wouldve died without his cash on him lmao

Shinada would know I'm just looking for a fight, he just fw me like that. He was going full force against Daigo, Daigo was the one going easy

I aint looking for any merit making a reddit tierlist
So um... who's gonna tell him ryoma also has a gun... and infinite ammo... and cuts bullets in half... and can be shot 30 times without dying... OP can probably only take one maybe two bullets before he's dead as dirt, ryoma clowns you easily no matter what, gun or not
    Yeah forgot ryoma's gun

He cant cut bullets in cutscenes tho and got done by bullets so yeah if he didnt have a gun I'd still win with one

I can take a lot of 9mm bullets before dying if they dont hit my head but would get os by stronger guns just like any other human as its been shown that we survive smaller bullets long enough to stab a cop at a certain distance. Still I'd die to ryoma bc of his gun and katana combo but katana alone I'd win
        No? First off we have seen other charecters cut bullets in cutscenes, charecters that he fights and out does speedwise, also gameplay still counts, I don't know why it wouldn't, and also you just said that a bullet isn't enough to kill fast enough to stop people from stabbing someone before they die, so can't he just stab you? Also he quick draws the shit out of you either way, his ass can block bullets with his hands when you have the right armor, so you literally stand no chance against him even if he was bare handed.
            I said ryoma nodiffs me idk why you arguing alone
Haruka is the only fight that would actually get you killed though
    Your entire global organisation would cease to exist within days
The surprise attack is meaningless when these guys walk off gunshot wounds and heavy machinery attacks.
    Thats why you should read the post before talking ^^ a knife surprise attack took out Kiryu, Kaito, and a gun surprise attack almost killed Akiyama too which he only survived through sheer luck
I don't know if you are surviving Haruka bro, I mean you'll survive her, just not what comes after.
    Thats good enough for me to put her there even if I know that doing that would make me the antagonist of Yakuza 9 that would be lil baby iwami's remake
I‚Äôm at the tier below the last one, one-shotting everyone
Winning against ryoma with a gun sounds hilarious
    Yeah sorry I forgot that I said it like 5 times I'm gonna edit my post lmao
Haruka would kick a mother fuckers ass, Haruka ain't scared of any one
    I'll iwami her, I'm quite the kiwami guy
Gun against Ryoma? He used guns too.
    Yeah I cant edit that post
This whole thread has been really fun to read. I'm not fighting any of these people. 

Could I beat the shit outta Haruka? Sure. But then I have to deal with the wrath of Kiryu and all his buddies. Annnnnnnd, I don't feel like dying.
    Thanks. Fair, even if I was stronger than Kiryu I still wouldnt fight him bc he got friends n shi too
this is my favorite post and comment section on this sub
    Thanks üëä I'll die on that hill but not alone
The greatest sin here is thinking you can beat AKIYAMA with a knife and prep time
    Everyone has a plan until they are 6 feet off the ground and being repeatedly, repeatedly, kicked and bounced off hard objects
    Kaito got beaten by a dude with a knife who sneak attacked him, akiyama's weaker and he already showed to being sneakable with munakata, I think I might have it
        That ‚Äúdude with a knife‚Äù was a Tojo Clan vet turned special agent with the National Police Agency. He‚Äôs also comparable to Yagami, someone you said you‚Äôd need a gun to *maybe* defeat.
            Yeah thats why they're in that tier. Akiyama aint comparable to Yagami tho
                So wait‚Ä¶are you saying you could beat kaito then? And that you‚Äôre comparable to Soma?
You are not beating shinada lol
    Not with that attitude fosho
You‚Äôre cooked against all of them
XD

Good luck bro
    Thanks üôè
        You're welcome üëç
Asakura, is that you?
You forgot Date, he was playable in Yakuza Kiwami Climax Battles: Proving Grounds 10.
    True, but you forgot to point out BD & HGG, Y7/8 secondary protagonists from the team, Kaito, the girl from Judgment, and the drone too !
        You also forgot the entire Gaiden coliseum roster.
            True, checkmate. Although I never played as another character except once and found it dogshit so completely forgot abt it lmao
haruka solos you lil bro
    Only if she has her fans by her side
So you can fight a guy able to punch tigers (ichiban)?
    Everybody can punch a tiger, that doesnt mean knocking them out with it. Ichiban won against a tiger in a 4v1 with weapons. Provided you're not pissing your pants, a team of 4 armed dudes would beat a tiger irl too
Dawg ya postin to reddit, Ya cooked with Haruka

Ya cooked with Date drunk walking

Sorry to say
    I will beat everybody on the tierlist one day
The only thing you beat is your own meat
    Thats the only way I could beat kiryu fr
Wow this is a wild one. I mean what follows delusion?
Ryoma is the one person you specifically wouldn't beat even with a gun. He's the best gunman in this image and probably in the franchise, Daigo notwithstanding.
    Yeah I forgot abt the gun. Sadly cant edit this but I agree I'm way more cooked with him than kiryu or tatsuya
I envy your self confidance
    It aint that big, I shouldve put tanimura above
You could beat Haruka, but for what cost ? The half of the characters of the franchise at√© hunting you after that lol
    Becoming the main villain of yakuza 9 and having a dope fight theme would be worth getting tigerdrop oneshotted for
        That's probally what Iwami's actor thought before signing the contract
‚Äúeasy money‚Äù that‚Äôs damn near free food
You are NOT beating Ichiban, if you stabbed him he would turn around and hug you
    I was thinking of aiming for the neck but even then some of the other guys might survive long enough to murder me like kiryu or ryuji, and others like majima I just feel like its not happening
beating yagami with a gun is the biggest cap he's literally the best protagonist when it comes to disarming his enemies. he has never been shot in the entire series
    if THE MOLE couldnt hit him youre not aiming at shit
        [deleted]
            i'm going to nerd react you now
        You mean, the mole who had to shoot tons of people beforehand ? You really believe that if the mole didnt have to do all that, which emptied his ammo, he wouldnt have beat Yagami ? You're more delusional than me by a lot then.
We also have to take into consideration what games you are playing. What games are you playing, OP?
    I've done all of them twice except the og2, 7, and havent finished my first playthrough of 8, k2 and kenzan yet. I also didnt play RGG online or binary domain if you wanna go that far
        Absorb the broken features of 2, Kenzan and K2. Also play games where a character has no problem killing brutally, absorb their traits, and boom, you're an unstoppable machine.
Bro, Ukyo would pop out your vertebrae like a Pez dispenser
    Thats why he's in cooked tier ? You read the tierlist in the wrong order bruh
        I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you kyodai
            Oh okay then but yeah Ik he kills me
Doesn't shinada do 1000 push ups and 1000 situps everyday?
    That means he's a great fighter ? Nah thats actually dogwater training especially if you do it everyday since you'll lack recovery. 1000 situps is quite easy, 1000 pushups' hard and the best I've done in a day was 500 when I was not as in shape as rn and 30-40lbs heavier than Shinada so at his weight I couldve done 700-800 most likely but still, thats one day not everyday. So I'd say its not that impressive alone, but the fact he does it everyday makes it more than a strength feat a recovery feat. That doesnt really translate to a one-time fight at all tho, but I guess whatever happens he'd recover faster than most yakuza protagonists
You didn't consider that Kiryu will fold your ass if you beat Haruka
    I did, it just doesnt matter. Even if I kill anyone elsehere I'd have problems after too anyway
Depends, is it a cutscene?
    Yes as I said its mainly based on cutscenes and lore (and ofc no plot armor)
Why does ryoma lose to a gun but not kiryu? Doesn't he have a gun too?
    At the time I forgot ryoma has a gun and consider him like musashi who prolly wouldnt understand what I'm doing pulling out a glock, so would get killed cuz he wouldnt try to stop me. If I'm pulling out a gun Kiryu knows what it is and I wouldnt have the time to do shit. Ryoma too but I forgot abt his gun and that it was already very present during his era when I made the post
Daigo "lost" to Shinada and he's fucking ripped!
    Daigo aint even trying and thats not an argument + I'm 20lbs heavier than shinada, I think I can at least beat him once out of ten times
I like that you imply a degree of uncertainty even with a gun for Yagami and the not Kiryus.
    Exclude ryoma

I think my luck for musashi is he doesnt know a gun so he'd not even try anything since he wouldnt understand, and Yagami would hide and I'd try to shoot him like kuroiwa did but kuroiwa used his bullets on other guys.

Whereas Ryuji level characters have been shown to just take bullets and continue going forward just to kill you so I aint trying that on him
you aint beating ryoma with a gun, remember that guy in the end of ishin?
    Forgot abt ryoma's gun and cant edit post :(
Even if you sneak attack Ichiban, his whole crew is always nearby to jump you.
    Ichiban alone even if that doesnt make that much sense
Where are these fights taking place?

If you fight haruka in sotenbori, chances are her fans are going to jump you
    I fight haruka in the hospital after she got in the hit and run
        Ahh, an even fight 

But if someone takes her up to the ruff you're finished
I might stand a chance against akiyama without weapons cus he uses legs in street fights, irl he'll be cooked easily
    Nah his legs are deadly and if you're really good with legs you can use them in street fights, its a good thing if you can do it properly
Tbh, I don't think your chances are too high against Tanimura and Akiyama with or without a sneak attack and knife

Akiyama, I think maybe if you get him to chase you and run a few laps, you might tire him out (bro, really needs to quit smoking)

Tanimura straight up washed Munakata's private security team, who were armed with knives, and they completely surrounded him in his QTE, and he still washed them 

Shinada, I kind of agree with 

But he's funky as hell. Because he has one of the most defined physiques of any protagonist despite just going off of a weird ass fitness routine and a diet of fucking nothing for the past 15 years.
    Stronger characters got beat like that, but at the same time by characters stronger than me. So with tanimura and akiyama I thought I lowered it to my level considering they're the weakest physically. 

In a fight, gassing out is deadly so I might beat akiyama without a knife but somehow he doesnt gass out from anything other than running so guess I'll run after slapping him

I feel like they were very dumb, how in the world are you gonna let a dude run and jump literally on you lmao... tanimura would beat me if I dont sneak attack with the knife he has better grappling skills than me too.

I'm like 15-20lbs heavier than shinada so being buff doesnt help him much here (he's like 185lbs and I'm 200)
Ryoma would god damn parry your bullets... Remember how he does that repeatedly in Ishin?
Do you ever think Haruka is the Gohan of the series?
    Nah
Where's Kaito-san üò°
    He wasnt there üòø but I'd want to give him knifediff because of Soma, yet at the same time with his DLC I feel like he should get to gun tier
        Where's Yagami where you need him "Oh...Yagami...üò©üí¶"
If I somehow got into a fight with any one of them I'd just immediately give up
    They don't stop when the enemy is scared on the ground sadly
Man, how do I get your confidence?
    Becoming strongwilled is easy just be delusionally ambitious
Bro is not beating Sakamoto Ry≈çma with a gun, literally more violent kiryu
    Violence has nothing to do with it but I lose to ryoma cuz at the time I forgot he had a gun
L, Haruka would mop the floor with OP regardless of prep time
    No prep time needed for her I minediff her ass
I wonder how many op's does it take to defeat kiryu ?
    Some with knives and cutscene kiryu

25-50 and I r8pe his ass in gameplay if he's on legend
When did Ryuji become a protagonist?
    Dead souls i guess
    Dead Souls
Bruh, does everyone forget that ichiban canonically beats 3 thugs in prison near to death after being jumped and restrained. Just because they insulted his boss/father figure.
    Beating 3 thugs isnt a big feat I could do it you could do it if you're trained anybody could with training and a strong body, although if I was in prison I wouldnt risk doing that lmao
Haruka would be a two part, 1 you winning against her, and 2 Kiryu coming to rip your head off and shit down your soul.
    Kiryu didnt do much to the guy who hit and runned her tho so I'm hopeful abt that
You‚Äôre forgetting that Ryoma carried around a Gat. A Strap, if you will. A toolie if one could be so inclined
    Yeah cant edit
No way you're beating Haruka. Guarantee Kiryu taught her how to handle herself.
    Enough to beat a dude as heavy as saejima who's training for fighting on the regular ? Maybe you're joking but I got that comment like 10 times do people expect haruka to be bruce lee ?
        Idk man the dancer fighting style is Majima's best and Haruka is a master at dance battles üò¨
            His best for crowd control and spam heat actions but slugger is stronger overall imo
Haruka has seen some shit and will wipe the floor with you.
Everyone wins against a fight using guns, dipshit

It came free with your deadly weaponry
Shinada was almost an elite athlete he would demolish you lmao
Since when is the dragon of Kansai a protagonist? And why are there 3 kiryus
You are not beating Ichiban with a knife and surprise attack, you are getting cooked in turn based combat to boot.
I don't know why you are underestimating our boy Shinada, since he is at least on the same tier as Tanimura and Ichiban and Akiyama should even be higher than them.

And going by your stats, you would be more powerful than a whole squad of trained and armed swat members or a whole Yakuza Family. 

Are you by any chance a Baki character in real life?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it canon that Haruka is actually insanely physically strong? I think somebody said she has gorilla strength? 

And Shinada is built like fucking Atlas. He is in peak condition and no way in hell are you passing him.
You're the dude who gets beat up in the tutorial and at 200lbs you ain't even the heavy.
    200lbs is saejima's weight for the record so I am in fact the heavy here + its just a statistic I don't rely on it only but mainly on weapons and skills
    Also Shishido was the tutorial for Gaiden so thanks for comparing me to a final boss who was tough enough to block Majima and Saejima after fighting Kiryu and walking up to the Omi HQ
Everyone already made the point about Shinada so need to beat a dead horse, but LOL thinking you‚Äôd take Akiyama even with a knife by surprise. Average internet delusion
    Someone forgot about kaito kiryu and akiyama being shown to...
[deleted]
    Yeah people think "shinada is fit" is an argument when he's almost 20lbs lighter than me and lacks hand to hand combat experience. "He won against Baba !!" bro relies on weapons and is the best at them, ofc he beat Baba

Without plot armor and gameplay they're so much weaker people don't seem to actually play those games, Kiryu & Kaito almost died to knife sneak attacks and Akiyama to a gunshot which surprised him yet somehow I can't sneak attack them ? Whaaat
Ichiban is a beast and on Kiryu's level. Don't be fooled by his goofiness.
    Thats why he fights with a whole ass gang. Although if I underestimate anyone here, its him (and Ryoma cuz I forgot he had a gun)
Thats the real question
    I mean, you might be able to beat like Saejima in a dance battle, but other than that a dance battle would be a far worse massacre.
        With how good Kiryu and Majima are at disco, you're just going to look like a fool
only if you're him

https://i.redd.it/7uje1mq4jawc1.gif
No one can. Next to her, everyone's a basic bitch.
I feel like she's kinda overrated dancing wise I would beat her in a matter of weeks if I trained for it. Akiyama would be 1000 times better at dancing realistically I would never surpass him. Haruka beats me at singing tho
    Yakuza fan with prep time
        I kinda can tbh, what are the characters gonna do ? Delete the games ?
    > I would beat her in a matter of weeks if I trained for it.

Not a hope: https://www.bu.edu/lernet/artemis/years/2017/projects/StudentWebsites/Michelle/pages/Kp.html

> The average training period for a trainee is 2 to 4 years.
        I'm saying she's a pretty bad dancer on stage so pulling some breakdance moves would be enough. She's a proper singer tho thats why I say I wouldnt even try to be better than her
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCWoUUWwdqg 

This is the expected standard of dancing in Kpop/Jpop you can go for it with the break dancing , but I'll admit it's pretty much considered one of THE if not the hardest choreos out there so I'll drop it down a notch or two...

How about this choreo?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcLvorudLfQ

Maybe this one instead? It works better if you've got the long hair for the hairography though

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBSt2ehzkm0

Don't forget you gotta be lip syncing to the song all the way through too...
                I don't need to do allat, have you seen haruka dance ? Yagami takes on her all day long
                    Dragon engine does a *lot* of heavy lifting there my dude üòâ
                        Maybe, still I could dance better than her and you could to. I know a dude completely out of shape who only spend his time drinking and he has way better dance moves than her
                            No "maybe" about it.  PS3 hardware is almost 20 years old at this point, so the animations are severely limited in comparison.

Come back when they release a Kiwami for Y5.
Shinada is no joke, don‚Äôt disrespect him like that. Ask the 6th chairman
How to get stuck in My Meteor Tackle near wall StarterPack
I think he's not pro-fighter level
    Are you pro-fighter level?
        This.

OP, if you haven't fought **at least** in a handful of amateur boxing matches/muay thai, I'm talking in a ring - sanctioned bout by your state, you ain't beating any of the people listed. Being a martial hobbyist ain't anywhere near Yakuza power levels, you best be posting gold hanging around your neck or waist.
        Amateur. An amateur can beat a pro at least once at out of ten times, at those levels luck is a heavy factor and style too, and Shinada isnt good at martial arts and gasses out, I think I can submit him considering I'm like 20lbs heavier than him and he doesnt know bjj or grappling
            You're amateur level and Shinada is a professional sportsman, his fighting style is the use of weapons AND could literally beat the shit out of an assassin 

Unless you shoot him in the face you don't have a chance against Shinada
                Amateur fighter vs (former) professional baseball player. Because an amateur swimmer is expected to be worse at swimming than a professional golf player üëç great logic

Also let alone reading the post, you couldnt even read whats written next to shinada
            Shinada beat Daigo. I get that his role in the plots get memed on pretty often, but Daigo was a final boss for Kiryu and held his own for a decent chunk of time. You'd be delusional to think you could beat the guy who beat him if you aren't an experienced fighter.
                Shinada didn't beat Daigo. Game makes it clear that Daigo was just testing him. Shinada literally faints post-fight
                Shinada doesnt beat Daigo quite the opposite, and Daigo wasnt even a hard fight at all for Kiryu, you're delusional about them more than I might be about myself
                    + an amateur fighter means you already have years of training fighting sports so I take experience too
            Doesn't know grappling? Have you seen him do Hell's Floor?
                Bro is grappling like he's in a RAW main event, I would't say he knows proper wrestling or bjj
    He beat a professional assassin 1v1 and is rip as hell, I think you are underselling his strenght. He is no Kiryu, Majima or Saejima, but he is still strong as hell.
        With weapons ! And Baba didnt have that dawg in him, bro was quitting his job anyway so you can say Shinada beat a jobless bald fucker at best. Being ripped as hell doesnt mean shit. Saying I'd only beat him once out of ten times is honestly giving him pro-fighter level credit
    yeah in terms of fighting skills, he doesn‚Äôt really have any but i think you forgot or at least underestimating his raw strength. A single raw amateur punch from him would realistically knock you out cold. I mean he even won against Daigo just because of his raw strength alone.
        Maybe, probably not. And no he didnt win against daigo
            damn, you‚Äôre really selling yourself high huh honestly even aside from the gameplay stuff shinada canonically fought and survived fights most wouldnt even come alive from. These characters aren‚Äôt meant to be realistic when it comes to it because they can fight against an army and win.

I‚Äôd lowkey argue you‚Äôd have more chance winning against Ichiban since he fights in parties so having to fight him solo would probably weaken him down a lot.
                Not really, you're just overestimating raw strength with no technique for koing

Its hard to scale ichiban and he tanked a combined jima attack that I cant match with physical AP thats why I put him there. But I could maybe submit him idk
                    ehh if it‚Äôs irl average people/fighter I agree with you but these fictional characters‚Äô strength were never realistic to begin with. Even with gameplay aside, they can still be considered superhuman in what they have achieved, even Shinada. In that universe, seeing how he still won or survived against fighting skilled people while just relying on his raw strength, ill take my chances.
    Or at best low pro. Which I can beat once out of 10 times, if you're amateur level at fighting with a bit of random factors you could win a few fights against dudes way better than you, that happens a lot
Yeah but HE NOT BEATING GOKU! NOBODY CAN BEAT GOKU! WHO YOU KNOW BEATING GOKU?
    Chi chi solos Goku
    Haruto stomps Goku, no contest
But what if it's a no sex contest?
Shinada fights like a dummass and relies heavily on weapon, I feel like an amateur fighter could take on him and tire him out at least once out of 10 times
    My guy, you're not beating Shinada. He's beaten multiple yakuza while outnumbered, and he's beaten Baba, who was an assassin. Not to mention, he qualified for the victory road tournament, which requires him to beat coliseum combatants in which many, if not all, are professional fighters
        You don't know OP bro once he sees red he's definitely winning 1/10 times.
            Wait till OP clenches their fist and talks about how no one wins alone, while a montage of all the people who impacted their life float across the screen.
                Shinada is f-ed if that happens.
        I still think in a 1v1 he's not favorised against a pro fighter and could lose to me once in 10 fights. He also fought Baba with weapons

I didnt took the victory road tournament into account shit, but not most of them aren't pros tho. Still, beating a pro is possible for an amateur way more than once out of 10 times
            There's no indication he fought Baba with weapons outside of player choice. The fight even has 3 QTE's, and not once does shinada use a weapon. Instead, he uses his bare hands to counter and stop Baba. 

And don't forget he managed to beat both Komaki's in a 2v1 to limit break (I'd say both komaki's qualify has pros) 

Sure, in the world of yakuza, there are pros that could beat shinada (Tatsuya and Tendo, for example), but any real-life pros would simply not compare, Shinada being a fictional character has levels of strength, endurance and durability that no one in real life can match up to. Again, this is a man who beat multiple combatants at once while said combatants had guns, swords, bats, daggers, etc. (There's a reason pro fighters or trainers will tell you not to engage when faced with a weapon or overwhelming numbers unless absolutely necessary. The risk of death or serious injury is not worth it) 

TL;DR Shinada has beaten pros, and by being a fictional character, is simply stronger and faster than any real-life pro
                Lorewise shinada is mainly using weapons and he has a dedicated moveset for them, just like majima with his knife. The reason they don't have weapons is because then they wouldve to force you to use the particular weapons or make qtes for all different types of weapons, which you shouldnt expect from RGG considering they avoid cost on stuff like that regularly, reusing assets etc

Mmh yeah if you consider the komaki stuff he'd nodiff me but I don't really took that and the arena into account since its not the story canon stuff
                    There's nothing that suggests that shinada used weapons for his fights outside of gameplay, and as you said yourself, you're trying to stay close to reality by  ignoring gameplay stuff. Well, in all of shinadas' dynamic sequences (which are required to progress), He doesn't use a weapon
                        Gameplay stuff doesnt matter however I think its heavily implied in the story and writing although I might be wrong and since I'm unsure I'm gonna stick to what I said before
                "By being a fictional character he's simply stronger and faster than any pro" with that logic anybody in the yakuzaverse is bc theyre all fiction character, cool to learn sohei dojima & haruto would beat JJ & GSP in a tagteam fight
                    I meant fictional characters that fight on the regular
                        I fight more regularly than shinada. Bro doesnt fight outside of y5
    Bro does 5000 swings, 1000 pushups and 1000 sit ups everyday. You are losing
        Thats sub optimal training ü§ì

I do better regular training and tons of fighters do, the 1000 pushups part is quite impressive tho considering he's only 15lbs lighter than me
            you are still losing.
                Nah I'd win
You would think people gets it after spending most part of the game beating random thugs with knifes and swords
    Or even getting shot multiple times and just getting back up after being a little dazed. Or Kiryu brushing off multiple shaped charge rockets blowing up on his face. He face tanks that shit better than an actual tank

I mean, damn, Kiryu breaks Majima's arms on a pretty regular basis and the fucker still gets back up like nothing. They get their bones pulverized and still beat the everliving shit out of you. You ain't making it out in a physical state other than liquid
    Read the description I'm not talking gameplay where they can take Amon satellite lasers
        Random street fights canonically happen, Kiryu mentions it in a sub-story. There are a lot of scripted fights were the enemies have swords and guns and Kiryu canonically doesn't receive damage, so yeah.....
            Beating some thugs in the street is not out of reach at all, you can and I can do it. Fighting multiple people can be very easy when they're intoxicated, not prepared, not trained, not coordinated, and/or just dumb. If you have 3 serious dudes its a completely different world than 3 dudes in a nightclub
                Did..... Did you played any Yakuza game at all?
                    All of them multiple times except rgg online, binary domain and another one.
                        Just in Yakuza 1 Kiryu manages to beat up a lot of Yakuza dudes with katanas
                            Ok, have you played yakuza 2, 3, 4, 6, and judgment / lost judgment ?
                                I played until 2, but I just recently bought the remasters collection. I'm just waiting for it to install
That's what I was thinking
Kaito lost against a knife surprise attack, I think those 3 could lose to that. I might misjudge Ichiban tbh but Akiyama and Tanimura don't have an insane durability
    Ichiban survived getting shot in the tit. That at least says something about his durability tbf
        He was put out of commission thats like death, if a dude kos me I know he couldve killed me in my sleep and I'd have done nothing, same applies with ichiban getting shot
You when you realize they spend enough CP and now they can sprint infinitely ü•≤
    CP??

I was not talking about a dance battle üòÖ

Running away works for half of them, some of them arent even affected by smoking 10 packs a day
Ryoma with sword and gun will win against any yakuza character, human or bulldozer it matters not, haha
I forgot about that and put him there cuz I thought he wouldnt even know wtf that is... üíÄ although maybe I can beat him with a better gun (100% sure I have one) and a bulletproof vest (still relies on where he gon shoot me first). But I think I'm cooked for him too
    Even Miyamoto 2 centuries before Ryoma knew guns. 

They were very heavily used during the battles of the civil wars in the late 16th century. There was even a troop of women fighting with guns in battles.
        One hand guns ? Or just the big ones (forgot the english name, muskeeters ? Idk) ? Bc its fine if its just the big ones, a modern gun like a glock looks so different he wouldnt understand soon enough imo
    Man can parry bullets...
        In gameplay...
            The man fought a mutant bear and picked a man up by his face, then managed to throw him so hard he knocked over 10 people with that one guy.

Sorry, but... You ain't got a shot in hell, unless you sneak attack + headshot with a gun, but then what's the point.
                And in what tier did I put him
                    I mean, you put Ryoma, the guy who parries bullets, who has displayed superhuman levels in terms of cutscenes in:
I could beat him if I had a gun levels
When this guy... Frankly he's a fucking animal in terms of strength and speed, beyond that of a human.
...
Your judgement ain't looking the best kid.
                        I said I put him in cooked (forgot he had a gun) 

Just look at ishin's end
                        "Kid" do you wear a fedora and smoke cigars ?
                            No, I think your the child of a female goat. Duh.
                                ?
    Someone tried beating him with a better gun and it didn't end well for them
        Lets try an even better gun then
            Dude literally had the best gun from the time period made by western gunsmiths
                At the time ü§ì

But that aside idk why you even arguing when I said I'd lose to ryoma as soon as I remembered he has a gun
Nah I'd win
    Nah you gettin fuckin curbstomped lil bro
        Maybe 9 times. Not the 10th tho
You either didnt read the post or don't remember what happened in those games brother
    No i read what you wrote plenty, and if you think any of thats enough it really aint.

If you have any fighting experience whatsoever then you should know that fighting a group of people who even sort of know what their doing gets your shit rocked 10/10. It doesnt matter if your mike tyson, if your against a group of decently sized, aggressive and angry men, your gonna get mobbed and stomped on. Shinada and co do that shit on a Wednesday.

And before you argue that oh its a video game and the enemies dont act like they would irl, how the hell are you meant to assess anything then in this tier list of yours? Its not like yakuza is known for being accurate fighting simulators, and judging by the fact that they fight through mobs that are armed to the teeth no problem, 200lbs and ‚Äú‚Äùsome‚Äù‚Äù fighting sports and gun/knife training is getting you about as far as a regular goon. 

These are fictional fighters, they are untouchable, and you thinking you can beat them to any capacity would be like me saying I can beat shinada cus I wrestle so I can surprise him by picking him up and dunking him onto his head. Makes no damn sense given how in setting, they fight far more and far meaner people that could ever exist irl.
        Fighting a group of person in yakuza is not the same as in real life. In kurohyou 2 & dead souls its pretty close to what actually happens tho

I'm basing myself on their statements and cinematic feats mostly
            I am aware dawg i even said dont bother arguing how its ‚ÄúnOt ReAlIsTiC‚Äù. No shit, its not, but sure lets say counting cinematography.

You only GET to those cinematic bits by fighting through the armies of men. Your ignoring that, cus that would automatically make it obvious you stand not a snowballs chance in hell against any of them. UFC Champion calibre fighters aint getting through half of what any of them went through in the gameplay youve chosen to completely ignore, which, btw, is like saying you can beat comic batman but like, only counting scenes where he had a broken back okay!!1!1!1!

But fine just cinemtography. Saejima, fought a mutant bear and lived. Saejima fought Baba and Baba didnt automatically die from Saejima laying his bear-beating hands on him. Shinada whooped Baba‚Äôs ass.

Regardless of how you look at it, again, your fucked, because again, these characters are fictional. They have feats and powers that a human being aint coming close to, much less someone who is ONLY the traits you describe.

What if they existed irl, surely you could beat Shinada right? Well what if the world was made of pudding, cus that doesnt matter. There is no way of scaling them that makes any sense other than being willfully ignorant of their superhuman bullshit that patently defies reality.
                Sure, even top UFC fighters can't beat an army of men. But in Yakuza, an army aint shit. One strong dude is better than an army. We have to compromise between our and yakuza's world, and 1v1s in yakuza are much closer to reality than the group fights
                    There is no ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù man. Multiple scenes show these regular dudes that make up the armies regularly harass and beat up regular people, because they SCALE as regular people. They aren‚Äôt suddenly weaker, its the protags that are given fictional fighter roids. You need to understand the crux of why you stand no chance: they are fictional. Any compromise you make breaks the canon in the way that makes it so you might as well be just making up new characters in a new media your trying to measure your fighting prowess against. Willfully ignoring the main meat of the games, the gameplay I mean, that would make it so that they completely annihilate you as opposed to just annihilating you, or suddenly deciding that in the world of yakuza numbers don‚Äôt mean shit when, as per your rules, Majima in a CINEMATIC in Kiwami 2 was at deaths door after fighting the army of the Omi alliance, first of all don‚Äôt change anything cus you lose anyway, and second of all DON‚ÄôT MATTER because they are ubermensch. 

By any metric in the world, no matter what you choose to tunnel vision on, they were written to be exceptionally bullshit, and debating whether or not you could beat them rings the same sentiment debating if you could beat Ryu and Ken or Jin Kazama or whatever. You cant, because they are not physically in the realm of humans.

                                Nah I legit didnt read we hearing each other and I got too many comments dawg
                Saejima went easy on Baba and look at Shinada's face after beating Baba who didnt even want to fight lmao. On top of that realize Shinada was allowed all his weapons

With feats comes antifeats. Sure, kiryu can beat tigers, but he's vulnerable to knives and can die from anyone cutting him. Maybe against him if he had the will to kill me he'd do it before bleeding out, but that'd work on Kaito tier dudes. Its relative, maybe I could kill Kiryu like that hobo almost did, maybe I couldnt (as in he wouldnt fully bleed out before killing me after I cut him) which is what I think. Still stuff like that and other scenes proved you can beat them.

Ofc it doesnt matter its a dumb tierlist on reddit. And no I'm not ignoring their superhuman feats, if I was I wouldnt even have a cooked tier to begin with lmao
                    1. No amount of going easy on someone is going to stop them from being absolutely mangled by someone who fights bears. Also why does Shinada have weapons, I thought gameplay scenes don‚Äôt count and as far as I recall, he never uses any in a cutscene. Not that it matters, Mr. Baba is a battery victim from a guy that fought a mutant bear, no iron pipe is hurting him‚Ä¶unless again, Shinada is superhuman, which he absolutely is.

2. Antifeats are everywhere dude, they don‚Äôt suddenly make it so you have a shot. Yeah they can be ambushed, in which case‚Ä¶why bother with the hypothetical. Walk up behind them and shoot them. Kind of pointless then.

3. Yeah your right, it doesn‚Äôt matter, your a grown man you are allowed to be woefully wrong about something. I am also allowed to join in on the silly tier list and say, as per my original comment, you are massively overestimating yourself big dawg.
                        I aint saying I fight saejima tho. And yes, by going easy you have ufc fighters kicking and punching an average girl that interviews them, so saejima can hold back against baba and not fight the same as against a bear. Also baba aint getting stronger from that he doesnt have saiyan genes lmao

Antifeats give ways of beating them

Exactly, you're allowed to be wrong
                            1. UFC fighters dont compare. YOU dont compare. And btw, how exactly do you picture Babas fight with Saejima? Sure there wasnt a cinematic, but Baba aint a slouch. Was he just treating Baba like how UFC fighters were treating anchor girls? Pretty sure if Saejima were that strong, hed just‚Ä¶never struggle. But he does. Cus im not claiming Baba has zenkai, Im claiming he survived an ass whooping from a guy that beat a bear‚Ä¶cus he is also superhuman. You can read what ive been writing over and over, its all gucci, as many times as you need to understand.

2. Yeah, but in the context of what your talking about they mean nothing. Oh they can be ambushed‚Ä¶so then your only way of winning is by ambushing them‚Ä¶so then whats the point? Why bother with this ‚ÄúYakuza protags I could beat in a fight‚Äù? You already know the answer, based on your antifeats you can ambush em and win. But no, your claiming you can FIGHT them, and lemme tell you unless that ambush is a quick shot to the brain, you cant.

3. If what your gathering is that Im somehow wrong on the topic of if a dude on reddit can beat cartoon superheroes, thats okay, theres no penalty for believing in wrong things. Your allowed to make mistakes my man, your human‚Ä¶which is also why, again you dont stand a chance lmao.
                                OP when Saejima just smacks him with a stop sign he tugged out the floor:
                                Its just an example to say a strong dude can hold back, and the gap between saejima and baba is WAAAAY smaller than the gap between pereira or strickland and the girl interviewing them

The point is having more than 3 tiers and giving interesting alternatives

Cutscenes showed us they're just as vulnerable as us, if you can't see that thats on you
                    Kiryu's vulnerable to knives in the sense that he gets hit by a complete non-combatant like random homeless people. Every other time, he's able to just straight up react to whatever shit is thrown at him including bullets at several times. It's just a diff measurement of super human abilities (speed and reaction time).
                        Every other time except in y3 which is the only ever time it happens outside of gameplay (ugh maybe majima stabs him too but I dont remember that)
            What about Kurohyou 1?
                In k1 enemies dont spam attack you at the same time so its like other yakuza games, groupfights still feel like 1v1
                    Yeah, I don't remember Kurohyou 1 that well, guess it's time to play it again
                        Finish it in ex-hard with ng+ (only game where I didnt do it by restarting completely, its way harder than the rest of the franchise lmao)
                            The Kurohyou games are ruthless
also Ichiban fought bulldozer and fought several different crime organizations just because he want to have a chat with their boss
That >!giant squid!< was a real son of a bitch too. Hardest damn boss fight in the game.
    i lost it when >!ichiban and chitose got swallowed!<
        >!It only ever went after Tomizawa for me lol. He must be traumatized after that.!<
    Man I was already level 69 when I got to it so it only got about 3 turns. I kinda trivialised the end of the game for myself by leveling up so much :')
    I went in underleveled and lost when he was one hit ;-; Then I learned you could stall by outhealing the stomach acid
    wong was harder and the squid wasnt bad at all tbh
yep
Ichibans feats become way less impressive when you realize he had a whole ass party fighting with him
    you still have to be pretty tough to make it out alive, and he's no slouch alone either
        Nah we'd make out and then I'd die
            lmao
        4 regular guys with weapons would beat a tiger provided they're not scared (which is the big "if")
Er... so does Ichiban have his whole party with him?
Shit, imagine how powerful Shinada would be if he was rich
just because someone is jacked doesnt mean they fight well
    shinada does fight pretty well though, and being jacked certainly helps with that. he and akiyama >!held off the omi in the finale!<
        Also we forgetting he fought toe to toe with Daigo which was literally the final boss of the previous game.
Being jacked isnt enough to beat a fighter, its not even his main strength his toughness is, and everybody is jacked in yakuza. Except tanimura and yagami lol

Surprise attacks have been working on the likes of Kiryu & Yagami who prolly fought more than Tanimura and Akiyam combined

I agree that I might underrate Ichiban especially since Yakuza 7 is the only one I haven't replayed on Legend, and I also haven't finished IW. However, you have to take into account that Ichiban fought that lion in a 4vs1 which is extremely easier than alone on top of having access to weapons (I shouldve precised everybody has to be unarmed except me & the samurais)

For Yagami, that's why I don't say I'm 100% winning. Despite knowing the basics of shooting someone he is good at pre-avoiding like Majima does. I also put the samurais there cuz musashi would be surprised by a gun and ryoma's gun is prolly nothing compared to recent ones
Daigo wasnt really going full at him, and Baba is just someone that loses to everybody he fought. I can count that as my feats since I sparred pro fighters and lost against them then lol. The thing is, Shinada lacking fighting experience is EXACTLY why I put him there separated from everybody else. I can pull a submission on him or tire him out outfighter boxer style

Ukyo Tatsuya goated, no chance in hell I do anything to him lmao
I've had huge people bodyslam through the ground and a door aint shit, although with a punch its still a great feat. But fighting strength doesnt mean in a more technical fight you're gonna hold up just as good, and Shinada's lack of experience make him risk getting submitted imo
    It wasnt just "people", it was Daigo who is strong AF. I think you're vastly underestimating him.
        Doesnt matter who he did that to, its the same feat of being able to put someone through a door. He couldve done that to Yujiro or Kiryu it wouldve been the same feat for him, the only that wouldve changed is they wouldve taken 0 damage
Not in cutscenes as he showed in the end game
    everybody's weak in cutscenes. 2, 5, 8, kiryu dies like every 3 games
        Weak no majima can still punch walls, kiryu beat tigers saejima a bear etc etc
            what does this even mean
                Talking about cutscenes ? Are you acoustic bro
                    *autistic
                        Thats on purpose
                            ![gif](giphy|p58AvYUeCZJ62gL2WK)
                                Its just a funny thing people say, idk why you're making it seem like not a lot of people do it. Are you restarted ?
                    your jumble of words does not make any sense
                        Aight just forget it then
Actually, Joryu also disassembles the gun if you do it in Agent Style.
Kuroiwa, and look at how Soma did Kaito and him
    yeah but you'll notice Yagami still beat Kuroiwa & Soma's asses lol
        Bro thinks he‚Äôs better than Kuroiwa and Soma. Lol
        Situational. Kuroiwa didnt have bullets bc of everyone else as long as he had bullets Yagami was hiding. Soma only attacked Kaito first bc he chosed to, not bc that wouldnt have worked on Yagami and the scene clearly indicated that on top of having Yagami almost getting pieced up by Soma at the beginning of their second fight
I'm heavier than him by about 20lbs, so, has he seen MY body ?
    ![gif](giphy|Y5Ii8PopcVCFy)
        Pov the body of people who think its impossible to beat tanimura or shinada in a fight
W Jibanyan pfp
Beating multiple people means nothing in this case. In a 1v1 you think he'd beat thor, tyson or JJ ? Kiryu would but not Shinada
    Yes, I'd say Shinada would beat Mike Tyson in a fight 1v1.  This is a guy who can have a whole glass dome fall on his head and walk it man, it doesn't matter how skilled you think you are, that skill isn't gonna matter to a guy going through a good number of people with Knifes, Guns, and by him fucking self.
        Aight then
I'm moving outside of Japan so he can't come to me... wait I forgot about IW
Also Y4 is full of a street battle quick time event when they gather a chance to react to being ‚Äòjumped‚Äô and usually parry the attack
Crippling humans is normal for humans to do, it happens a lot
    \>Launching another human being through the air several metres with one punch is actually totally normal.
        Strawman much ? I'm saying crippling people. A random bum can do that to a random bum, so ofc Shinada does it too
            No it's literally what you're saying, when I said crippling I linked to an example of Shinada punching someone through the air looney tunes style

Though crippling is kinda generous, the force from that punch would put any normal human it hit in the head into quite the coma.
                Nah I'm literally talking about crippling people in general. If I say the sky is blue you're gonna tell me "oh well you're saying there's never been a cloud ?", its just not the same thing talked about
                    Then you're just strawmanning what I'm saying...?
                        Kinda the opposite
                            No, you're fully just ignoring the actual evidence I was presenting to give context to my point and what I meant in terms of severity in the word cripple to just focus specifically on that word and ignore said evidence.

You're inventing a new argument to go at, that is the definition of strawmanning.
                                Strawmanning is when I say "well, crippling a human is a basic human level feat" and you say "what you think punching someone meters away through a door is a basic human level feat ?"
This is what I'm saying, I'm saying they're cutscenes. Can you read a full sentence ? Idk what you're trying to argue here
    Then what the hell is your point? This isn't which characters you could beat or whatever it's a vague list that then has practically nothing to do with the characters because you've just decided what they've shown apparently doesn't matter.

What are you even basing your rankings off then?
        If you read the full sentence you would see the point. Yk, the part where there's a "but" and I explain whats not taken into account lmao
            Then it's still nothing because it's you arbitrarily deciding what does and what doesn't count for the sake of putting your ego up a fictional character I guess lmao
                No one is beating them gameplay wise bc guns arent guns, knives arent knives and they can just use glitches or use inventory items mid-fight. Very smart.
                    Cool...? That wasn't my point, it was that there was many, many non-gameplay instances of them that would be evidence to them ripping off a normal human's head.
                        Compromise between feats and antifeats is key
                            And that compromise is these characters are blatantly superhuman and have clearly been presented as since the very inception of the series.

What even is your "compromise" here?
                                Their characters have been seen to be vulnerable enough times to assume they can be beaten without plot armor
Bro was gonna get done by Kuroiwa if he didnt shot 1000 dudes before, and Soma couldve stabbed him instead of Kaito if he wanted to. Give me a gun and I'm betting my life on that W
Yeah haruka can probably beat a tiger too
Thats why I'm saying I aint sure of winning... no plot armor tho hopefully
When you beat the boss but the combat music doesn't stop.
    Rolling eyes fall..
I mean, I just said I can beat her. What happens another issue... and even if somehow I beat Kiryu by pushing him off the Millenium Tower when he wasnt looking and he doesnt fall on rubber concrete, then I'd have the tojo dudes on me too, same with pretty much everyone here who's not friendless like shinada

(edit : yes shinada has friends but aside from Daigo, they aint trying anything)
listen i love shinada and i 100% think op can‚Äôt beat him but shinada didn‚Äôt really beat daigo. he‚Äôs still standing after the fight, meanwhile shinada collapses from exhaustion. daigo saw how strong shinada‚Äôs resolve was and stood down.
    I said he has the same power as him, didn't say he beat him
Akiyama lost to a downed Munakata Seishiro with a gun

Kaito got nodiff by Soma with 2 knives

Kiryu got nodiff by a hobo with a knife and then that dude from y3-4

Yagami almost died against Kuroiwa's gun which puts his friend out of commission

Ryoma got done by bullets against a much weaker dude

"You can't sneak on Ichiban because he's the next Dragon !" As if Kiryu didnt got sneak attacked and left for dead in y2 & 3

Yagami wouldve lost to Kuroiwa if Kuroiwa didnt use his bullets for 100 dudes & hoodie thief hot guy, and again, Kaito got done by a knife who is relative to Yagami, also Soma almost killed Yagami the same way

I could win a fight against haruka probably not a dance battle and definitely not a singing battle
    Akiyama didn't lose to munakata, if you watched the scene you would know what happened

Idk, still haven't reached that part yet

But the fact he can still stand normally two hours later, yeah maybe you wanna reconsider (this series has this weird logic with very strong protagonists so idk)

Haven't reached that yet

Haven't played ishin so can't really drop my thoughts

Again, ichiban can still stand normally like 38 year old kiryu, and kiryu himself managed to walk fine with some pain in Y2 (I don't really have a fucking clue what happened with Y3 kiryu)

a

"I could win a fight against haruka not a dance nor a sing battle" so what you gonna be a criminal or something?
        He got surprise shot by munakata and wouldve died if not for plot armor gag. That just means he wasnt on guard in the most important moment of his life atp, and I could sneak attack and kill him with a knife or gun. 

2 hours during which he couldve been killed very easily

"Kiryu managed to walk fine with some pain" naaaah thats crazy dude was dying and you had to reach the doc in a short notice before literally bleeding out and dying, on top of that he was barely walking

Pretty much every yakuza protagonist is a criminal somewhat, and saying I could beat a woman shouldnt be different than a man here considering in both cases you'd consider that assault & battery
I aint calling that a stand still bro, Daigo messing around like he's Kiryu

Akiyama got gundiff by Munakata, Kiryu got stab and almost died multiple times, I don't need to talk about the Judgment games

There's no chance in hell I'm risking fighting Yagami or a samurai without a gun
    Kiryu got stabbed once because he was in a bad head space by a person who was homeless or pretending to be and the second time because he reached his hand out to help someone turn their life around.

He got stabbed not because of lack of reflex but because of his trust in people, something Tanimura and Akiyama dont have as much of.

Also, iirc Munakata shot Akiyama AFTER he fought Arai as it was Arai‚Äôs gun that he grabbed so your point there means nothing unless you plan on hiring dudes to jump him first.

Shinada would tackle you into a a wall and fold you like a lawn chair the minute he thinks your trying to kill him, something Daigo wasn‚Äôt trying to do to him so you‚Äôre getting full force Shinada.

And again there‚Äôs no merit in saying you can kill these dudes in a sneak attack or with a gun, I‚Äôd respect you more if it was a tier list of how well/long you can fight these characters
        I'll just pretend I'm homeless to akiyama then. You think he doesnt trust people ? He got done by kido & arai, he let munakata his gun close to him, he gave millions to saejima's sister, he let haruka near park, he lends money to lots of people based on loose tests, shall I continue ?

Yeah Tanimura's different, but he's also way weaker. The only reason I wouldnt go unarmed against him is he'd submit me before I submit him in hand to hand combat, so with a gun I top his superior grappling game

It doesnt change that you can sneak attack akiyama and that he wouldve died without his cash on him lmao

Shinada would know I'm just looking for a fight, he just fw me like that. He was going full force against Daigo, Daigo was the one going easy

I aint looking for any merit making a reddit tierlist
Yeah forgot ryoma's gun

He cant cut bullets in cutscenes tho and got done by bullets so yeah if he didnt have a gun I'd still win with one

I can take a lot of 9mm bullets before dying if they dont hit my head but would get os by stronger guns just like any other human as its been shown that we survive smaller bullets long enough to stab a cop at a certain distance. Still I'd die to ryoma bc of his gun and katana combo but katana alone I'd win
    No? First off we have seen other charecters cut bullets in cutscenes, charecters that he fights and out does speedwise, also gameplay still counts, I don't know why it wouldn't, and also you just said that a bullet isn't enough to kill fast enough to stop people from stabbing someone before they die, so can't he just stab you? Also he quick draws the shit out of you either way, his ass can block bullets with his hands when you have the right armor, so you literally stand no chance against him even if he was bare handed.
        I said ryoma nodiffs me idk why you arguing alone
Your entire global organisation would cease to exist within days
Thats why you should read the post before talking ^^ a knife surprise attack took out Kiryu, Kaito, and a gun surprise attack almost killed Akiyama too which he only survived through sheer luck
Thats good enough for me to put her there even if I know that doing that would make me the antagonist of Yakuza 9 that would be lil baby iwami's remake
Yeah sorry I forgot that I said it like 5 times I'm gonna edit my post lmao
I'll iwami her, I'm quite the kiwami guy
Yeah I cant edit that post
Thanks. Fair, even if I was stronger than Kiryu I still wouldnt fight him bc he got friends n shi too
Thanks üëä I'll die on that hill but not alone
Everyone has a plan until they are 6 feet off the ground and being repeatedly, repeatedly, kicked and bounced off hard objects
Kaito got beaten by a dude with a knife who sneak attacked him, akiyama's weaker and he already showed to being sneakable with munakata, I think I might have it
    That ‚Äúdude with a knife‚Äù was a Tojo Clan vet turned special agent with the National Police Agency. He‚Äôs also comparable to Yagami, someone you said you‚Äôd need a gun to *maybe* defeat.
        Yeah thats why they're in that tier. Akiyama aint comparable to Yagami tho
            So wait‚Ä¶are you saying you could beat kaito then? And that you‚Äôre comparable to Soma?
Not with that attitude fosho
Thanks üôè
    You're welcome üëç
True, but you forgot to point out BD & HGG, Y7/8 secondary protagonists from the team, Kaito, the girl from Judgment, and the drone too !
    You also forgot the entire Gaiden coliseum roster.
        True, checkmate. Although I never played as another character except once and found it dogshit so completely forgot abt it lmao
Only if she has her fans by her side
Everybody can punch a tiger, that doesnt mean knocking them out with it. Ichiban won against a tiger in a 4v1 with weapons. Provided you're not pissing your pants, a team of 4 armed dudes would beat a tiger irl too
I will beat everybody on the tierlist one day
Thats the only way I could beat kiryu fr
Yeah I forgot abt the gun. Sadly cant edit this but I agree I'm way more cooked with him than kiryu or tatsuya
It aint that big, I shouldve put tanimura above
Becoming the main villain of yakuza 9 and having a dope fight theme would be worth getting tigerdrop oneshotted for
    That's probally what Iwami's actor thought before signing the contract
I was thinking of aiming for the neck but even then some of the other guys might survive long enough to murder me like kiryu or ryuji, and others like majima I just feel like its not happening
if THE MOLE couldnt hit him youre not aiming at shit
    [deleted]
        i'm going to nerd react you now
    You mean, the mole who had to shoot tons of people beforehand ? You really believe that if the mole didnt have to do all that, which emptied his ammo, he wouldnt have beat Yagami ? You're more delusional than me by a lot then.
I've done all of them twice except the og2, 7, and havent finished my first playthrough of 8, k2 and kenzan yet. I also didnt play RGG online or binary domain if you wanna go that far
    Absorb the broken features of 2, Kenzan and K2. Also play games where a character has no problem killing brutally, absorb their traits, and boom, you're an unstoppable machine.
Thats why he's in cooked tier ? You read the tierlist in the wrong order bruh
    I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you kyodai
        Oh okay then but yeah Ik he kills me
That means he's a great fighter ? Nah thats actually dogwater training especially if you do it everyday since you'll lack recovery. 1000 situps is quite easy, 1000 pushups' hard and the best I've done in a day was 500 when I was not as in shape as rn and 30-40lbs heavier than Shinada so at his weight I couldve done 700-800 most likely but still, thats one day not everyday. So I'd say its not that impressive alone, but the fact he does it everyday makes it more than a strength feat a recovery feat. That doesnt really translate to a one-time fight at all tho, but I guess whatever happens he'd recover faster than most yakuza protagonists
I did, it just doesnt matter. Even if I kill anyone elsehere I'd have problems after too anyway
Yes as I said its mainly based on cutscenes and lore (and ofc no plot armor)
At the time I forgot ryoma has a gun and consider him like musashi who prolly wouldnt understand what I'm doing pulling out a glock, so would get killed cuz he wouldnt try to stop me. If I'm pulling out a gun Kiryu knows what it is and I wouldnt have the time to do shit. Ryoma too but I forgot abt his gun and that it was already very present during his era when I made the post
Daigo aint even trying and thats not an argument + I'm 20lbs heavier than shinada, I think I can at least beat him once out of ten times
Exclude ryoma

I think my luck for musashi is he doesnt know a gun so he'd not even try anything since he wouldnt understand, and Yagami would hide and I'd try to shoot him like kuroiwa did but kuroiwa used his bullets on other guys.

Whereas Ryuji level characters have been shown to just take bullets and continue going forward just to kill you so I aint trying that on him
Forgot abt ryoma's gun and cant edit post :(
Ichiban alone even if that doesnt make that much sense
I fight haruka in the hospital after she got in the hit and run
    Ahh, an even fight 

But if someone takes her up to the ruff you're finished
Nah his legs are deadly and if you're really good with legs you can use them in street fights, its a good thing if you can do it properly
Stronger characters got beat like that, but at the same time by characters stronger than me. So with tanimura and akiyama I thought I lowered it to my level considering they're the weakest physically. 

In a fight, gassing out is deadly so I might beat akiyama without a knife but somehow he doesnt gass out from anything other than running so guess I'll run after slapping him

I feel like they were very dumb, how in the world are you gonna let a dude run and jump literally on you lmao... tanimura would beat me if I dont sneak attack with the knife he has better grappling skills than me too.

I'm like 15-20lbs heavier than shinada so being buff doesnt help him much here (he's like 185lbs and I'm 200)
Nah
He wasnt there üòø but I'd want to give him knifediff because of Soma, yet at the same time with his DLC I feel like he should get to gun tier
    Where's Yagami where you need him "Oh...Yagami...üò©üí¶"
They don't stop when the enemy is scared on the ground sadly
Becoming strongwilled is easy just be delusionally ambitious
Violence has nothing to do with it but I lose to ryoma cuz at the time I forgot he had a gun
No prep time needed for her I minediff her ass
Some with knives and cutscene kiryu

25-50 and I r8pe his ass in gameplay if he's on legend
Dead souls i guess
Dead Souls
Beating 3 thugs isnt a big feat I could do it you could do it if you're trained anybody could with training and a strong body, although if I was in prison I wouldnt risk doing that lmao
Kiryu didnt do much to the guy who hit and runned her tho so I'm hopeful abt that
Yeah cant edit
Enough to beat a dude as heavy as saejima who's training for fighting on the regular ? Maybe you're joking but I got that comment like 10 times do people expect haruka to be bruce lee ?
    Idk man the dancer fighting style is Majima's best and Haruka is a master at dance battles üò¨
        His best for crowd control and spam heat actions but slugger is stronger overall imo
200lbs is saejima's weight for the record so I am in fact the heavy here + its just a statistic I don't rely on it only but mainly on weapons and skills
Also Shishido was the tutorial for Gaiden so thanks for comparing me to a final boss who was tough enough to block Majima and Saejima after fighting Kiryu and walking up to the Omi HQ
Someone forgot about kaito kiryu and akiyama being shown to...
Yeah people think "shinada is fit" is an argument when he's almost 20lbs lighter than me and lacks hand to hand combat experience. "He won against Baba !!" bro relies on weapons and is the best at them, ofc he beat Baba

Without plot armor and gameplay they're so much weaker people don't seem to actually play those games, Kiryu & Kaito almost died to knife sneak attacks and Akiyama to a gunshot which surprised him yet somehow I can't sneak attack them ? Whaaat
Thats why he fights with a whole ass gang. Although if I underestimate anyone here, its him (and Ryoma cuz I forgot he had a gun)
I mean, you might be able to beat like Saejima in a dance battle, but other than that a dance battle would be a far worse massacre.
    With how good Kiryu and Majima are at disco, you're just going to look like a fool
Yakuza fan with prep time
    I kinda can tbh, what are the characters gonna do ? Delete the games ?
> I would beat her in a matter of weeks if I trained for it.

Not a hope: https://www.bu.edu/lernet/artemis/years/2017/projects/StudentWebsites/Michelle/pages/Kp.html

> The average training period for a trainee is 2 to 4 years.
    I'm saying she's a pretty bad dancer on stage so pulling some breakdance moves would be enough. She's a proper singer tho thats why I say I wouldnt even try to be better than her
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCWoUUWwdqg 

This is the expected standard of dancing in Kpop/Jpop you can go for it with the break dancing , but I'll admit it's pretty much considered one of THE if not the hardest choreos out there so I'll drop it down a notch or two...

How about this choreo?

Maybe this one instead? It works better if you've got the long hair for the hairography though

Don't forget you gotta be lip syncing to the song all the way through too...
            I don't need to do allat, have you seen haruka dance ? Yagami takes on her all day long
                Dragon engine does a *lot* of heavy lifting there my dude üòâ
                    Maybe, still I could dance better than her and you could to. I know a dude completely out of shape who only spend his time drinking and he has way better dance moves than her
                        No "maybe" about it.  PS3 hardware is almost 20 years old at this point, so the animations are severely limited in comparison.

Come back when they release a Kiwami for Y5.
Are you pro-fighter level?
    This.

OP, if you haven't fought **at least** in a handful of amateur boxing matches/muay thai, I'm talking in a ring - sanctioned bout by your state, you ain't beating any of the people listed. Being a martial hobbyist ain't anywhere near Yakuza power levels, you best be posting gold hanging around your neck or waist.
    Amateur. An amateur can beat a pro at least once at out of ten times, at those levels luck is a heavy factor and style too, and Shinada isnt good at martial arts and gasses out, I think I can submit him considering I'm like 20lbs heavier than him and he doesnt know bjj or grappling
        You're amateur level and Shinada is a professional sportsman, his fighting style is the use of weapons AND could literally beat the shit out of an assassin 

Unless you shoot him in the face you don't have a chance against Shinada
            Amateur fighter vs (former) professional baseball player. Because an amateur swimmer is expected to be worse at swimming than a professional golf player üëç great logic

Also let alone reading the post, you couldnt even read whats written next to shinada
        Shinada beat Daigo. I get that his role in the plots get memed on pretty often, but Daigo was a final boss for Kiryu and held his own for a decent chunk of time. You'd be delusional to think you could beat the guy who beat him if you aren't an experienced fighter.
            Shinada didn't beat Daigo. Game makes it clear that Daigo was just testing him. Shinada literally faints post-fight
            Shinada doesnt beat Daigo quite the opposite, and Daigo wasnt even a hard fight at all for Kiryu, you're delusional about them more than I might be about myself
                + an amateur fighter means you already have years of training fighting sports so I take experience too
        Doesn't know grappling? Have you seen him do Hell's Floor?
            Bro is grappling like he's in a RAW main event, I would't say he knows proper wrestling or bjj
He beat a professional assassin 1v1 and is rip as hell, I think you are underselling his strenght. He is no Kiryu, Majima or Saejima, but he is still strong as hell.
    With weapons ! And Baba didnt have that dawg in him, bro was quitting his job anyway so you can say Shinada beat a jobless bald fucker at best. Being ripped as hell doesnt mean shit. Saying I'd only beat him once out of ten times is honestly giving him pro-fighter level credit
yeah in terms of fighting skills, he doesn‚Äôt really have any but i think you forgot or at least underestimating his raw strength. A single raw amateur punch from him would realistically knock you out cold. I mean he even won against Daigo just because of his raw strength alone.
    Maybe, probably not. And no he didnt win against daigo
        damn, you‚Äôre really selling yourself high huh honestly even aside from the gameplay stuff shinada canonically fought and survived fights most wouldnt even come alive from. These characters aren‚Äôt meant to be realistic when it comes to it because they can fight against an army and win.

I‚Äôd lowkey argue you‚Äôd have more chance winning against Ichiban since he fights in parties so having to fight him solo would probably weaken him down a lot.
            Not really, you're just overestimating raw strength with no technique for koing

Its hard to scale ichiban and he tanked a combined jima attack that I cant match with physical AP thats why I put him there. But I could maybe submit him idk
                ehh if it‚Äôs irl average people/fighter I agree with you but these fictional characters‚Äô strength were never realistic to begin with. Even with gameplay aside, they can still be considered superhuman in what they have achieved, even Shinada. In that universe, seeing how he still won or survived against fighting skilled people while just relying on his raw strength, ill take my chances.
Or at best low pro. Which I can beat once out of 10 times, if you're amateur level at fighting with a bit of random factors you could win a few fights against dudes way better than you, that happens a lot
Chi chi solos Goku
Haruto stomps Goku, no contest
My guy, you're not beating Shinada. He's beaten multiple yakuza while outnumbered, and he's beaten Baba, who was an assassin. Not to mention, he qualified for the victory road tournament, which requires him to beat coliseum combatants in which many, if not all, are professional fighters
    You don't know OP bro once he sees red he's definitely winning 1/10 times.
        Wait till OP clenches their fist and talks about how no one wins alone, while a montage of all the people who impacted their life float across the screen.
            Shinada is f-ed if that happens.
    I still think in a 1v1 he's not favorised against a pro fighter and could lose to me once in 10 fights. He also fought Baba with weapons

I didnt took the victory road tournament into account shit, but not most of them aren't pros tho. Still, beating a pro is possible for an amateur way more than once out of 10 times
        There's no indication he fought Baba with weapons outside of player choice. The fight even has 3 QTE's, and not once does shinada use a weapon. Instead, he uses his bare hands to counter and stop Baba. 

And don't forget he managed to beat both Komaki's in a 2v1 to limit break (I'd say both komaki's qualify has pros) 

Sure, in the world of yakuza, there are pros that could beat shinada (Tatsuya and Tendo, for example), but any real-life pros would simply not compare, Shinada being a fictional character has levels of strength, endurance and durability that no one in real life can match up to. Again, this is a man who beat multiple combatants at once while said combatants had guns, swords, bats, daggers, etc. (There's a reason pro fighters or trainers will tell you not to engage when faced with a weapon or overwhelming numbers unless absolutely necessary. The risk of death or serious injury is not worth it) 

TL;DR Shinada has beaten pros, and by being a fictional character, is simply stronger and faster than any real-life pro
            Lorewise shinada is mainly using weapons and he has a dedicated moveset for them, just like majima with his knife. The reason they don't have weapons is because then they wouldve to force you to use the particular weapons or make qtes for all different types of weapons, which you shouldnt expect from RGG considering they avoid cost on stuff like that regularly, reusing assets etc

Mmh yeah if you consider the komaki stuff he'd nodiff me but I don't really took that and the arena into account since its not the story canon stuff
                There's nothing that suggests that shinada used weapons for his fights outside of gameplay, and as you said yourself, you're trying to stay close to reality by  ignoring gameplay stuff. Well, in all of shinadas' dynamic sequences (which are required to progress), He doesn't use a weapon
                    Gameplay stuff doesnt matter however I think its heavily implied in the story and writing although I might be wrong and since I'm unsure I'm gonna stick to what I said before
            "By being a fictional character he's simply stronger and faster than any pro" with that logic anybody in the yakuzaverse is bc theyre all fiction character, cool to learn sohei dojima & haruto would beat JJ & GSP in a tagteam fight
                I meant fictional characters that fight on the regular
                    I fight more regularly than shinada. Bro doesnt fight outside of y5
Bro does 5000 swings, 1000 pushups and 1000 sit ups everyday. You are losing
    Thats sub optimal training ü§ì

I do better regular training and tons of fighters do, the 1000 pushups part is quite impressive tho considering he's only 15lbs lighter than me
        you are still losing.
            Nah I'd win
Or even getting shot multiple times and just getting back up after being a little dazed. Or Kiryu brushing off multiple shaped charge rockets blowing up on his face. He face tanks that shit better than an actual tank

I mean, damn, Kiryu breaks Majima's arms on a pretty regular basis and the fucker still gets back up like nothing. They get their bones pulverized and still beat the everliving shit out of you. You ain't making it out in a physical state other than liquid
Read the description I'm not talking gameplay where they can take Amon satellite lasers
    Random street fights canonically happen, Kiryu mentions it in a sub-story. There are a lot of scripted fights were the enemies have swords and guns and Kiryu canonically doesn't receive damage, so yeah.....
        Beating some thugs in the street is not out of reach at all, you can and I can do it. Fighting multiple people can be very easy when they're intoxicated, not prepared, not trained, not coordinated, and/or just dumb. If you have 3 serious dudes its a completely different world than 3 dudes in a nightclub
            Did..... Did you played any Yakuza game at all?
                All of them multiple times except rgg online, binary domain and another one.
                    Just in Yakuza 1 Kiryu manages to beat up a lot of Yakuza dudes with katanas
                        Ok, have you played yakuza 2, 3, 4, 6, and judgment / lost judgment ?
                            I played until 2, but I just recently bought the remasters collection. I'm just waiting for it to install
Ichiban survived getting shot in the tit. That at least says something about his durability tbf
    He was put out of commission thats like death, if a dude kos me I know he couldve killed me in my sleep and I'd have done nothing, same applies with ichiban getting shot
CP??

Even Miyamoto 2 centuries before Ryoma knew guns. 

They were very heavily used during the battles of the civil wars in the late 16th century. There was even a troop of women fighting with guns in battles.
    One hand guns ? Or just the big ones (forgot the english name, muskeeters ? Idk) ? Bc its fine if its just the big ones, a modern gun like a glock looks so different he wouldnt understand soon enough imo
Man can parry bullets...
    In gameplay...
        The man fought a mutant bear and picked a man up by his face, then managed to throw him so hard he knocked over 10 people with that one guy.

Sorry, but... You ain't got a shot in hell, unless you sneak attack + headshot with a gun, but then what's the point.
            And in what tier did I put him
                I mean, you put Ryoma, the guy who parries bullets, who has displayed superhuman levels in terms of cutscenes in:
I could beat him if I had a gun levels
When this guy... Frankly he's a fucking animal in terms of strength and speed, beyond that of a human.
...
Your judgement ain't looking the best kid.
                    I said I put him in cooked (forgot he had a gun) 

Just look at ishin's end
                    "Kid" do you wear a fedora and smoke cigars ?
                        No, I think your the child of a female goat. Duh.
                            ?
Someone tried beating him with a better gun and it didn't end well for them
    Lets try an even better gun then
        Dude literally had the best gun from the time period made by western gunsmiths
            At the time ü§ì

But that aside idk why you even arguing when I said I'd lose to ryoma as soon as I remembered he has a gun
Nah you gettin fuckin curbstomped lil bro
    Maybe 9 times. Not the 10th tho
No i read what you wrote plenty, and if you think any of thats enough it really aint.

If you have any fighting experience whatsoever then you should know that fighting a group of people who even sort of know what their doing gets your shit rocked 10/10. It doesnt matter if your mike tyson, if your against a group of decently sized, aggressive and angry men, your gonna get mobbed and stomped on. Shinada and co do that shit on a Wednesday.

And before you argue that oh its a video game and the enemies dont act like they would irl, how the hell are you meant to assess anything then in this tier list of yours? Its not like yakuza is known for being accurate fighting simulators, and judging by the fact that they fight through mobs that are armed to the teeth no problem, 200lbs and ‚Äú‚Äùsome‚Äù‚Äù fighting sports and gun/knife training is getting you about as far as a regular goon. 

These are fictional fighters, they are untouchable, and you thinking you can beat them to any capacity would be like me saying I can beat shinada cus I wrestle so I can surprise him by picking him up and dunking him onto his head. Makes no damn sense given how in setting, they fight far more and far meaner people that could ever exist irl.
    Fighting a group of person in yakuza is not the same as in real life. In kurohyou 2 & dead souls its pretty close to what actually happens tho

I'm basing myself on their statements and cinematic feats mostly
        I am aware dawg i even said dont bother arguing how its ‚ÄúnOt ReAlIsTiC‚Äù. No shit, its not, but sure lets say counting cinematography.

You only GET to those cinematic bits by fighting through the armies of men. Your ignoring that, cus that would automatically make it obvious you stand not a snowballs chance in hell against any of them. UFC Champion calibre fighters aint getting through half of what any of them went through in the gameplay youve chosen to completely ignore, which, btw, is like saying you can beat comic batman but like, only counting scenes where he had a broken back okay!!1!1!1!

But fine just cinemtography. Saejima, fought a mutant bear and lived. Saejima fought Baba and Baba didnt automatically die from Saejima laying his bear-beating hands on him. Shinada whooped Baba‚Äôs ass.

Regardless of how you look at it, again, your fucked, because again, these characters are fictional. They have feats and powers that a human being aint coming close to, much less someone who is ONLY the traits you describe.

What if they existed irl, surely you could beat Shinada right? Well what if the world was made of pudding, cus that doesnt matter. There is no way of scaling them that makes any sense other than being willfully ignorant of their superhuman bullshit that patently defies reality.
            Sure, even top UFC fighters can't beat an army of men. But in Yakuza, an army aint shit. One strong dude is better than an army. We have to compromise between our and yakuza's world, and 1v1s in yakuza are much closer to reality than the group fights
                There is no ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù man. Multiple scenes show these regular dudes that make up the armies regularly harass and beat up regular people, because they SCALE as regular people. They aren‚Äôt suddenly weaker, its the protags that are given fictional fighter roids. You need to understand the crux of why you stand no chance: they are fictional. Any compromise you make breaks the canon in the way that makes it so you might as well be just making up new characters in a new media your trying to measure your fighting prowess against. Willfully ignoring the main meat of the games, the gameplay I mean, that would make it so that they completely annihilate you as opposed to just annihilating you, or suddenly deciding that in the world of yakuza numbers don‚Äôt mean shit when, as per your rules, Majima in a CINEMATIC in Kiwami 2 was at deaths door after fighting the army of the Omi alliance, first of all don‚Äôt change anything cus you lose anyway, and second of all DON‚ÄôT MATTER because they are ubermensch. 

By any metric in the world, no matter what you choose to tunnel vision on, they were written to be exceptionally bullshit, and debating whether or not you could beat them rings the same sentiment debating if you could beat Ryu and Ken or Jin Kazama or whatever. You cant, because they are not physically in the realm of humans.
                    Aint reading all that big dog but I'm sure you made a great point üôè make a tldr pls
                        Lmaoo you don‚Äôt gotta be pretending to be all suave and shit, just stop replying if you got nothing more to say broski, no ones forcing youüòÜ
                            Nah I legit didnt read we hearing each other and I got too many comments dawg
            Saejima went easy on Baba and look at Shinada's face after beating Baba who didnt even want to fight lmao. On top of that realize Shinada was allowed all his weapons

With feats comes antifeats. Sure, kiryu can beat tigers, but he's vulnerable to knives and can die from anyone cutting him. Maybe against him if he had the will to kill me he'd do it before bleeding out, but that'd work on Kaito tier dudes. Its relative, maybe I could kill Kiryu like that hobo almost did, maybe I couldnt (as in he wouldnt fully bleed out before killing me after I cut him) which is what I think. Still stuff like that and other scenes proved you can beat them.

Ofc it doesnt matter its a dumb tierlist on reddit. And no I'm not ignoring their superhuman feats, if I was I wouldnt even have a cooked tier to begin with lmao
                1. No amount of going easy on someone is going to stop them from being absolutely mangled by someone who fights bears. Also why does Shinada have weapons, I thought gameplay scenes don‚Äôt count and as far as I recall, he never uses any in a cutscene. Not that it matters, Mr. Baba is a battery victim from a guy that fought a mutant bear, no iron pipe is hurting him‚Ä¶unless again, Shinada is superhuman, which he absolutely is.

2. Antifeats are everywhere dude, they don‚Äôt suddenly make it so you have a shot. Yeah they can be ambushed, in which case‚Ä¶why bother with the hypothetical. Walk up behind them and shoot them. Kind of pointless then.

3. Yeah your right, it doesn‚Äôt matter, your a grown man you are allowed to be woefully wrong about something. I am also allowed to join in on the silly tier list and say, as per my original comment, you are massively overestimating yourself big dawg.
                    I aint saying I fight saejima tho. And yes, by going easy you have ufc fighters kicking and punching an average girl that interviews them, so saejima can hold back against baba and not fight the same as against a bear. Also baba aint getting stronger from that he doesnt have saiyan genes lmao

Antifeats give ways of beating them

Exactly, you're allowed to be wrong
                        1. UFC fighters dont compare. YOU dont compare. And btw, how exactly do you picture Babas fight with Saejima? Sure there wasnt a cinematic, but Baba aint a slouch. Was he just treating Baba like how UFC fighters were treating anchor girls? Pretty sure if Saejima were that strong, hed just‚Ä¶never struggle. But he does. Cus im not claiming Baba has zenkai, Im claiming he survived an ass whooping from a guy that beat a bear‚Ä¶cus he is also superhuman. You can read what ive been writing over and over, its all gucci, as many times as you need to understand.

2. Yeah, but in the context of what your talking about they mean nothing. Oh they can be ambushed‚Ä¶so then your only way of winning is by ambushing them‚Ä¶so then whats the point? Why bother with this ‚ÄúYakuza protags I could beat in a fight‚Äù? You already know the answer, based on your antifeats you can ambush em and win. But no, your claiming you can FIGHT them, and lemme tell you unless that ambush is a quick shot to the brain, you cant.

3. If what your gathering is that Im somehow wrong on the topic of if a dude on reddit can beat cartoon superheroes, thats okay, theres no penalty for believing in wrong things. Your allowed to make mistakes my man, your human‚Ä¶which is also why, again you dont stand a chance lmao.
                            OP when Saejima just smacks him with a stop sign he tugged out the floor:
                            Its just an example to say a strong dude can hold back, and the gap between saejima and baba is WAAAAY smaller than the gap between pereira or strickland and the girl interviewing them

The point is having more than 3 tiers and giving interesting alternatives

Cutscenes showed us they're just as vulnerable as us, if you can't see that thats on you
                Kiryu's vulnerable to knives in the sense that he gets hit by a complete non-combatant like random homeless people. Every other time, he's able to just straight up react to whatever shit is thrown at him including bullets at several times. It's just a diff measurement of super human abilities (speed and reaction time).
                    Every other time except in y3 which is the only ever time it happens outside of gameplay (ugh maybe majima stabs him too but I dont remember that)
        What about Kurohyou 1?
            In k1 enemies dont spam attack you at the same time so its like other yakuza games, groupfights still feel like 1v1
                Yeah, I don't remember Kurohyou 1 that well, guess it's time to play it again
                    Finish it in ex-hard with ng+ (only game where I didnt do it by restarting completely, its way harder than the rest of the franchise lmao)
                        The Kurohyou games are ruthless
i lost it when >!ichiban and chitose got swallowed!<
    >!It only ever went after Tomizawa for me lol. He must be traumatized after that.!<
Man I was already level 69 when I got to it so it only got about 3 turns. I kinda trivialised the end of the game for myself by leveling up so much :')
I went in underleveled and lost when he was one hit ;-; Then I learned you could stall by outhealing the stomach acid
wong was harder and the squid wasnt bad at all tbh
you still have to be pretty tough to make it out alive, and he's no slouch alone either
    Nah we'd make out and then I'd die
        lmao
    4 regular guys with weapons would beat a tiger provided they're not scared (which is the big "if")
shinada does fight pretty well though, and being jacked certainly helps with that. he and akiyama >!held off the omi in the finale!<
    Also we forgetting he fought toe to toe with Daigo which was literally the final boss of the previous game.
It wasnt just "people", it was Daigo who is strong AF. I think you're vastly underestimating him.
    Doesnt matter who he did that to, its the same feat of being able to put someone through a door. He couldve done that to Yujiro or Kiryu it wouldve been the same feat for him, the only that wouldve changed is they wouldve taken 0 damage
everybody's weak in cutscenes. 2, 5, 8, kiryu dies like every 3 games
    Weak no majima can still punch walls, kiryu beat tigers saejima a bear etc etc
        what does this even mean
            Talking about cutscenes ? Are you acoustic bro
                *autistic
                    Thats on purpose
                        ![gif](giphy|p58AvYUeCZJ62gL2WK)
                            Its just a funny thing people say, idk why you're making it seem like not a lot of people do it. Are you restarted ?
                your jumble of words does not make any sense
                    Aight just forget it then
yeah but you'll notice Yagami still beat Kuroiwa & Soma's asses lol
    Bro thinks he‚Äôs better than Kuroiwa and Soma. Lol
    Situational. Kuroiwa didnt have bullets bc of everyone else as long as he had bullets Yagami was hiding. Soma only attacked Kaito first bc he chosed to, not bc that wouldnt have worked on Yagami and the scene clearly indicated that on top of having Yagami almost getting pieced up by Soma at the beginning of their second fight
![gif](giphy|Y5Ii8PopcVCFy)
    Pov the body of people who think its impossible to beat tanimura or shinada in a fight
Yes, I'd say Shinada would beat Mike Tyson in a fight 1v1.  This is a guy who can have a whole glass dome fall on his head and walk it man, it doesn't matter how skilled you think you are, that skill isn't gonna matter to a guy going through a good number of people with Knifes, Guns, and by him fucking self.
    Aight then
\>Launching another human being through the air several metres with one punch is actually totally normal.
    Strawman much ? I'm saying crippling people. A random bum can do that to a random bum, so ofc Shinada does it too
        No it's literally what you're saying, when I said crippling I linked to an example of Shinada punching someone through the air looney tunes style

Though crippling is kinda generous, the force from that punch would put any normal human it hit in the head into quite the coma.
            Nah I'm literally talking about crippling people in general. If I say the sky is blue you're gonna tell me "oh well you're saying there's never been a cloud ?", its just not the same thing talked about
                Then you're just strawmanning what I'm saying...?
                    Kinda the opposite
                        No, you're fully just ignoring the actual evidence I was presenting to give context to my point and what I meant in terms of severity in the word cripple to just focus specifically on that word and ignore said evidence.

You're inventing a new argument to go at, that is the definition of strawmanning.
                            Strawmanning is when I say "well, crippling a human is a basic human level feat" and you say "what you think punching someone meters away through a door is a basic human level feat ?"
Then what the hell is your point? This isn't which characters you could beat or whatever it's a vague list that then has practically nothing to do with the characters because you've just decided what they've shown apparently doesn't matter.

What are you even basing your rankings off then?
    If you read the full sentence you would see the point. Yk, the part where there's a "but" and I explain whats not taken into account lmao
        Then it's still nothing because it's you arbitrarily deciding what does and what doesn't count for the sake of putting your ego up a fictional character I guess lmao
            No one is beating them gameplay wise bc guns arent guns, knives arent knives and they can just use glitches or use inventory items mid-fight. Very smart.
                Cool...? That wasn't my point, it was that there was many, many non-gameplay instances of them that would be evidence to them ripping off a normal human's head.
                    Compromise between feats and antifeats is key
                        And that compromise is these characters are blatantly superhuman and have clearly been presented as since the very inception of the series.

What even is your "compromise" here?
                            Their characters have been seen to be vulnerable enough times to assume they can be beaten without plot armor
Rolling eyes fall..
I said he has the same power as him, didn't say he beat him
Akiyama didn't lose to munakata, if you watched the scene you would know what happened

Idk, still haven't reached that part yet

But the fact he can still stand normally two hours later, yeah maybe you wanna reconsider (this series has this weird logic with very strong protagonists so idk)

Haven't reached that yet

Haven't played ishin so can't really drop my thoughts

Again, ichiban can still stand normally like 38 year old kiryu, and kiryu himself managed to walk fine with some pain in Y2 (I don't really have a fucking clue what happened with Y3 kiryu)

a

"I could win a fight against haruka not a dance nor a sing battle" so what you gonna be a criminal or something?
    He got surprise shot by munakata and wouldve died if not for plot armor gag. That just means he wasnt on guard in the most important moment of his life atp, and I could sneak attack and kill him with a knife or gun. 

2 hours during which he couldve been killed very easily

"Kiryu managed to walk fine with some pain" naaaah thats crazy dude was dying and you had to reach the doc in a short notice before literally bleeding out and dying, on top of that he was barely walking

Pretty much every yakuza protagonist is a criminal somewhat, and saying I could beat a woman shouldnt be different than a man here considering in both cases you'd consider that assault & battery
Kiryu got stabbed once because he was in a bad head space by a person who was homeless or pretending to be and the second time because he reached his hand out to help someone turn their life around.

He got stabbed not because of lack of reflex but because of his trust in people, something Tanimura and Akiyama dont have as much of.

Also, iirc Munakata shot Akiyama AFTER he fought Arai as it was Arai‚Äôs gun that he grabbed so your point there means nothing unless you plan on hiring dudes to jump him first.

Shinada would tackle you into a a wall and fold you like a lawn chair the minute he thinks your trying to kill him, something Daigo wasn‚Äôt trying to do to him so you‚Äôre getting full force Shinada.

And again there‚Äôs no merit in saying you can kill these dudes in a sneak attack or with a gun, I‚Äôd respect you more if it was a tier list of how well/long you can fight these characters
    I'll just pretend I'm homeless to akiyama then. You think he doesnt trust people ? He got done by kido & arai, he let munakata his gun close to him, he gave millions to saejima's sister, he let haruka near park, he lends money to lots of people based on loose tests, shall I continue ?

Yeah Tanimura's different, but he's also way weaker. The only reason I wouldnt go unarmed against him is he'd submit me before I submit him in hand to hand combat, so with a gun I top his superior grappling game

It doesnt change that you can sneak attack akiyama and that he wouldve died without his cash on him lmao

Shinada would know I'm just looking for a fight, he just fw me like that. He was going full force against Daigo, Daigo was the one going easy

I aint looking for any merit making a reddit tierlist
No? First off we have seen other charecters cut bullets in cutscenes, charecters that he fights and out does speedwise, also gameplay still counts, I don't know why it wouldn't, and also you just said that a bullet isn't enough to kill fast enough to stop people from stabbing someone before they die, so can't he just stab you? Also he quick draws the shit out of you either way, his ass can block bullets with his hands when you have the right armor, so you literally stand no chance against him even if he was bare handed.
    I said ryoma nodiffs me idk why you arguing alone
That ‚Äúdude with a knife‚Äù was a Tojo Clan vet turned special agent with the National Police Agency. He‚Äôs also comparable to Yagami, someone you said you‚Äôd need a gun to *maybe* defeat.
    Yeah thats why they're in that tier. Akiyama aint comparable to Yagami tho
        So wait‚Ä¶are you saying you could beat kaito then? And that you‚Äôre comparable to Soma?
You're welcome üëç
You also forgot the entire Gaiden coliseum roster.
    True, checkmate. Although I never played as another character except once and found it dogshit so completely forgot abt it lmao
That's probally what Iwami's actor thought before signing the contract
[deleted]
    i'm going to nerd react you now
You mean, the mole who had to shoot tons of people beforehand ? You really believe that if the mole didnt have to do all that, which emptied his ammo, he wouldnt have beat Yagami ? You're more delusional than me by a lot then.
Absorb the broken features of 2, Kenzan and K2. Also play games where a character has no problem killing brutally, absorb their traits, and boom, you're an unstoppable machine.
I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you kyodai
    Oh okay then but yeah Ik he kills me
Ahh, an even fight 

But if someone takes her up to the ruff you're finished
Where's Yagami where you need him "Oh...Yagami...üò©üí¶"
Idk man the dancer fighting style is Majima's best and Haruka is a master at dance battles üò¨
    His best for crowd control and spam heat actions but slugger is stronger overall imo
With how good Kiryu and Majima are at disco, you're just going to look like a fool
I kinda can tbh, what are the characters gonna do ? Delete the games ?
I'm saying she's a pretty bad dancer on stage so pulling some breakdance moves would be enough. She's a proper singer tho thats why I say I wouldnt even try to be better than her
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCWoUUWwdqg 

This is the expected standard of dancing in Kpop/Jpop you can go for it with the break dancing , but I'll admit it's pretty much considered one of THE if not the hardest choreos out there so I'll drop it down a notch or two...

How about this choreo?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcLvorudLfQ

Maybe this one instead? It works better if you've got the long hair for the hairography though

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBSt2ehzkm0

Don't forget you gotta be lip syncing to the song all the way through too...
        I don't need to do allat, have you seen haruka dance ? Yagami takes on her all day long
            Dragon engine does a *lot* of heavy lifting there my dude üòâ
                Maybe, still I could dance better than her and you could to. I know a dude completely out of shape who only spend his time drinking and he has way better dance moves than her
                    No "maybe" about it.  PS3 hardware is almost 20 years old at this point, so the animations are severely limited in comparison.

Come back when they release a Kiwami for Y5.
This.

OP, if you haven't fought **at least** in a handful of amateur boxing matches/muay thai, I'm talking in a ring - sanctioned bout by your state, you ain't beating any of the people listed. Being a martial hobbyist ain't anywhere near Yakuza power levels, you best be posting gold hanging around your neck or waist.
Amateur. An amateur can beat a pro at least once at out of ten times, at those levels luck is a heavy factor and style too, and Shinada isnt good at martial arts and gasses out, I think I can submit him considering I'm like 20lbs heavier than him and he doesnt know bjj or grappling
    You're amateur level and Shinada is a professional sportsman, his fighting style is the use of weapons AND could literally beat the shit out of an assassin 

Unless you shoot him in the face you don't have a chance against Shinada
        Amateur fighter vs (former) professional baseball player. Because an amateur swimmer is expected to be worse at swimming than a professional golf player üëç great logic

Also let alone reading the post, you couldnt even read whats written next to shinada
    Shinada beat Daigo. I get that his role in the plots get memed on pretty often, but Daigo was a final boss for Kiryu and held his own for a decent chunk of time. You'd be delusional to think you could beat the guy who beat him if you aren't an experienced fighter.
        Shinada didn't beat Daigo. Game makes it clear that Daigo was just testing him. Shinada literally faints post-fight
        Shinada doesnt beat Daigo quite the opposite, and Daigo wasnt even a hard fight at all for Kiryu, you're delusional about them more than I might be about myself
            + an amateur fighter means you already have years of training fighting sports so I take experience too
    Doesn't know grappling? Have you seen him do Hell's Floor?
        Bro is grappling like he's in a RAW main event, I would't say he knows proper wrestling or bjj
With weapons ! And Baba didnt have that dawg in him, bro was quitting his job anyway so you can say Shinada beat a jobless bald fucker at best. Being ripped as hell doesnt mean shit. Saying I'd only beat him once out of ten times is honestly giving him pro-fighter level credit
Maybe, probably not. And no he didnt win against daigo
    damn, you‚Äôre really selling yourself high huh honestly even aside from the gameplay stuff shinada canonically fought and survived fights most wouldnt even come alive from. These characters aren‚Äôt meant to be realistic when it comes to it because they can fight against an army and win.

I‚Äôd lowkey argue you‚Äôd have more chance winning against Ichiban since he fights in parties so having to fight him solo would probably weaken him down a lot.
        Not really, you're just overestimating raw strength with no technique for koing

Its hard to scale ichiban and he tanked a combined jima attack that I cant match with physical AP thats why I put him there. But I could maybe submit him idk
            ehh if it‚Äôs irl average people/fighter I agree with you but these fictional characters‚Äô strength were never realistic to begin with. Even with gameplay aside, they can still be considered superhuman in what they have achieved, even Shinada. In that universe, seeing how he still won or survived against fighting skilled people while just relying on his raw strength, ill take my chances.
You don't know OP bro once he sees red he's definitely winning 1/10 times.
    Wait till OP clenches their fist and talks about how no one wins alone, while a montage of all the people who impacted their life float across the screen.
        Shinada is f-ed if that happens.
I still think in a 1v1 he's not favorised against a pro fighter and could lose to me once in 10 fights. He also fought Baba with weapons

I didnt took the victory road tournament into account shit, but not most of them aren't pros tho. Still, beating a pro is possible for an amateur way more than once out of 10 times
    There's no indication he fought Baba with weapons outside of player choice. The fight even has 3 QTE's, and not once does shinada use a weapon. Instead, he uses his bare hands to counter and stop Baba. 

And don't forget he managed to beat both Komaki's in a 2v1 to limit break (I'd say both komaki's qualify has pros) 

Sure, in the world of yakuza, there are pros that could beat shinada (Tatsuya and Tendo, for example), but any real-life pros would simply not compare, Shinada being a fictional character has levels of strength, endurance and durability that no one in real life can match up to. Again, this is a man who beat multiple combatants at once while said combatants had guns, swords, bats, daggers, etc. (There's a reason pro fighters or trainers will tell you not to engage when faced with a weapon or overwhelming numbers unless absolutely necessary. The risk of death or serious injury is not worth it) 

TL;DR Shinada has beaten pros, and by being a fictional character, is simply stronger and faster than any real-life pro
        Lorewise shinada is mainly using weapons and he has a dedicated moveset for them, just like majima with his knife. The reason they don't have weapons is because then they wouldve to force you to use the particular weapons or make qtes for all different types of weapons, which you shouldnt expect from RGG considering they avoid cost on stuff like that regularly, reusing assets etc

Mmh yeah if you consider the komaki stuff he'd nodiff me but I don't really took that and the arena into account since its not the story canon stuff
            There's nothing that suggests that shinada used weapons for his fights outside of gameplay, and as you said yourself, you're trying to stay close to reality by  ignoring gameplay stuff. Well, in all of shinadas' dynamic sequences (which are required to progress), He doesn't use a weapon
                Gameplay stuff doesnt matter however I think its heavily implied in the story and writing although I might be wrong and since I'm unsure I'm gonna stick to what I said before
        "By being a fictional character he's simply stronger and faster than any pro" with that logic anybody in the yakuzaverse is bc theyre all fiction character, cool to learn sohei dojima & haruto would beat JJ & GSP in a tagteam fight
            I meant fictional characters that fight on the regular
                I fight more regularly than shinada. Bro doesnt fight outside of y5
Thats sub optimal training ü§ì

I do better regular training and tons of fighters do, the 1000 pushups part is quite impressive tho considering he's only 15lbs lighter than me
    you are still losing.
        Nah I'd win
Random street fights canonically happen, Kiryu mentions it in a sub-story. There are a lot of scripted fights were the enemies have swords and guns and Kiryu canonically doesn't receive damage, so yeah.....
    Beating some thugs in the street is not out of reach at all, you can and I can do it. Fighting multiple people can be very easy when they're intoxicated, not prepared, not trained, not coordinated, and/or just dumb. If you have 3 serious dudes its a completely different world than 3 dudes in a nightclub
        Did..... Did you played any Yakuza game at all?
            All of them multiple times except rgg online, binary domain and another one.
                Just in Yakuza 1 Kiryu manages to beat up a lot of Yakuza dudes with katanas
                    Ok, have you played yakuza 2, 3, 4, 6, and judgment / lost judgment ?
                        I played until 2, but I just recently bought the remasters collection. I'm just waiting for it to install
He was put out of commission thats like death, if a dude kos me I know he couldve killed me in my sleep and I'd have done nothing, same applies with ichiban getting shot

One hand guns ? Or just the big ones (forgot the english name, muskeeters ? Idk) ? Bc its fine if its just the big ones, a modern gun like a glock looks so different he wouldnt understand soon enough imo
In gameplay...
    The man fought a mutant bear and picked a man up by his face, then managed to throw him so hard he knocked over 10 people with that one guy.

Sorry, but... You ain't got a shot in hell, unless you sneak attack + headshot with a gun, but then what's the point.
        And in what tier did I put him
            I mean, you put Ryoma, the guy who parries bullets, who has displayed superhuman levels in terms of cutscenes in:
I could beat him if I had a gun levels
When this guy... Frankly he's a fucking animal in terms of strength and speed, beyond that of a human.
...
Your judgement ain't looking the best kid.
                I said I put him in cooked (forgot he had a gun) 

Just look at ishin's end
                "Kid" do you wear a fedora and smoke cigars ?
                    No, I think your the child of a female goat. Duh.
                        ?
Lets try an even better gun then
    Dude literally had the best gun from the time period made by western gunsmiths
        At the time ü§ì

But that aside idk why you even arguing when I said I'd lose to ryoma as soon as I remembered he has a gun
Maybe 9 times. Not the 10th tho
Fighting a group of person in yakuza is not the same as in real life. In kurohyou 2 & dead souls its pretty close to what actually happens tho

I'm basing myself on their statements and cinematic feats mostly
    I am aware dawg i even said dont bother arguing how its ‚ÄúnOt ReAlIsTiC‚Äù. No shit, its not, but sure lets say counting cinematography.

You only GET to those cinematic bits by fighting through the armies of men. Your ignoring that, cus that would automatically make it obvious you stand not a snowballs chance in hell against any of them. UFC Champion calibre fighters aint getting through half of what any of them went through in the gameplay youve chosen to completely ignore, which, btw, is like saying you can beat comic batman but like, only counting scenes where he had a broken back okay!!1!1!1!

But fine just cinemtography. Saejima, fought a mutant bear and lived. Saejima fought Baba and Baba didnt automatically die from Saejima laying his bear-beating hands on him. Shinada whooped Baba‚Äôs ass.

Regardless of how you look at it, again, your fucked, because again, these characters are fictional. They have feats and powers that a human being aint coming close to, much less someone who is ONLY the traits you describe.

What if they existed irl, surely you could beat Shinada right? Well what if the world was made of pudding, cus that doesnt matter. There is no way of scaling them that makes any sense other than being willfully ignorant of their superhuman bullshit that patently defies reality.
        Sure, even top UFC fighters can't beat an army of men. But in Yakuza, an army aint shit. One strong dude is better than an army. We have to compromise between our and yakuza's world, and 1v1s in yakuza are much closer to reality than the group fights
            There is no ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù man. Multiple scenes show these regular dudes that make up the armies regularly harass and beat up regular people, because they SCALE as regular people. They aren‚Äôt suddenly weaker, its the protags that are given fictional fighter roids. You need to understand the crux of why you stand no chance: they are fictional. Any compromise you make breaks the canon in the way that makes it so you might as well be just making up new characters in a new media your trying to measure your fighting prowess against. Willfully ignoring the main meat of the games, the gameplay I mean, that would make it so that they completely annihilate you as opposed to just annihilating you, or suddenly deciding that in the world of yakuza numbers don‚Äôt mean shit when, as per your rules, Majima in a CINEMATIC in Kiwami 2 was at deaths door after fighting the army of the Omi alliance, first of all don‚Äôt change anything cus you lose anyway, and second of all DON‚ÄôT MATTER because they are ubermensch. 

By any metric in the world, no matter what you choose to tunnel vision on, they were written to be exceptionally bullshit, and debating whether or not you could beat them rings the same sentiment debating if you could beat Ryu and Ken or Jin Kazama or whatever. You cant, because they are not physically in the realm of humans.
                Aint reading all that big dog but I'm sure you made a great point üôè make a tldr pls
                    Lmaoo you don‚Äôt gotta be pretending to be all suave and shit, just stop replying if you got nothing more to say broski, no ones forcing youüòÜ
                        Nah I legit didnt read we hearing each other and I got too many comments dawg
        Saejima went easy on Baba and look at Shinada's face after beating Baba who didnt even want to fight lmao. On top of that realize Shinada was allowed all his weapons

With feats comes antifeats. Sure, kiryu can beat tigers, but he's vulnerable to knives and can die from anyone cutting him. Maybe against him if he had the will to kill me he'd do it before bleeding out, but that'd work on Kaito tier dudes. Its relative, maybe I could kill Kiryu like that hobo almost did, maybe I couldnt (as in he wouldnt fully bleed out before killing me after I cut him) which is what I think. Still stuff like that and other scenes proved you can beat them.

Ofc it doesnt matter its a dumb tierlist on reddit. And no I'm not ignoring their superhuman feats, if I was I wouldnt even have a cooked tier to begin with lmao
            1. No amount of going easy on someone is going to stop them from being absolutely mangled by someone who fights bears. Also why does Shinada have weapons, I thought gameplay scenes don‚Äôt count and as far as I recall, he never uses any in a cutscene. Not that it matters, Mr. Baba is a battery victim from a guy that fought a mutant bear, no iron pipe is hurting him‚Ä¶unless again, Shinada is superhuman, which he absolutely is.

2. Antifeats are everywhere dude, they don‚Äôt suddenly make it so you have a shot. Yeah they can be ambushed, in which case‚Ä¶why bother with the hypothetical. Walk up behind them and shoot them. Kind of pointless then.

3. Yeah your right, it doesn‚Äôt matter, your a grown man you are allowed to be woefully wrong about something. I am also allowed to join in on the silly tier list and say, as per my original comment, you are massively overestimating yourself big dawg.
                I aint saying I fight saejima tho. And yes, by going easy you have ufc fighters kicking and punching an average girl that interviews them, so saejima can hold back against baba and not fight the same as against a bear. Also baba aint getting stronger from that he doesnt have saiyan genes lmao

Antifeats give ways of beating them

Exactly, you're allowed to be wrong
                    1. UFC fighters dont compare. YOU dont compare. And btw, how exactly do you picture Babas fight with Saejima? Sure there wasnt a cinematic, but Baba aint a slouch. Was he just treating Baba like how UFC fighters were treating anchor girls? Pretty sure if Saejima were that strong, hed just‚Ä¶never struggle. But he does. Cus im not claiming Baba has zenkai, Im claiming he survived an ass whooping from a guy that beat a bear‚Ä¶cus he is also superhuman. You can read what ive been writing over and over, its all gucci, as many times as you need to understand.

2. Yeah, but in the context of what your talking about they mean nothing. Oh they can be ambushed‚Ä¶so then your only way of winning is by ambushing them‚Ä¶so then whats the point? Why bother with this ‚ÄúYakuza protags I could beat in a fight‚Äù? You already know the answer, based on your antifeats you can ambush em and win. But no, your claiming you can FIGHT them, and lemme tell you unless that ambush is a quick shot to the brain, you cant.

3. If what your gathering is that Im somehow wrong on the topic of if a dude on reddit can beat cartoon superheroes, thats okay, theres no penalty for believing in wrong things. Your allowed to make mistakes my man, your human‚Ä¶which is also why, again you dont stand a chance lmao.
                        OP when Saejima just smacks him with a stop sign he tugged out the floor:
                        Its just an example to say a strong dude can hold back, and the gap between saejima and baba is WAAAAY smaller than the gap between pereira or strickland and the girl interviewing them

The point is having more than 3 tiers and giving interesting alternatives

Cutscenes showed us they're just as vulnerable as us, if you can't see that thats on you
            Kiryu's vulnerable to knives in the sense that he gets hit by a complete non-combatant like random homeless people. Every other time, he's able to just straight up react to whatever shit is thrown at him including bullets at several times. It's just a diff measurement of super human abilities (speed and reaction time).
                Every other time except in y3 which is the only ever time it happens outside of gameplay (ugh maybe majima stabs him too but I dont remember that)
    What about Kurohyou 1?
        In k1 enemies dont spam attack you at the same time so its like other yakuza games, groupfights still feel like 1v1
            Yeah, I don't remember Kurohyou 1 that well, guess it's time to play it again
                Finish it in ex-hard with ng+ (only game where I didnt do it by restarting completely, its way harder than the rest of the franchise lmao)
                    The Kurohyou games are ruthless
>!It only ever went after Tomizawa for me lol. He must be traumatized after that.!<
Nah we'd make out and then I'd die
    lmao
4 regular guys with weapons would beat a tiger provided they're not scared (which is the big "if")
Also we forgetting he fought toe to toe with Daigo which was literally the final boss of the previous game.
Doesnt matter who he did that to, its the same feat of being able to put someone through a door. He couldve done that to Yujiro or Kiryu it wouldve been the same feat for him, the only that wouldve changed is they wouldve taken 0 damage
Weak no majima can still punch walls, kiryu beat tigers saejima a bear etc etc
    what does this even mean
        Talking about cutscenes ? Are you acoustic bro
            *autistic
                Thats on purpose
                    ![gif](giphy|p58AvYUeCZJ62gL2WK)
                        Its just a funny thing people say, idk why you're making it seem like not a lot of people do it. Are you restarted ?
            your jumble of words does not make any sense
                Aight just forget it then
Bro thinks he‚Äôs better than Kuroiwa and Soma. Lol
Situational. Kuroiwa didnt have bullets bc of everyone else as long as he had bullets Yagami was hiding. Soma only attacked Kaito first bc he chosed to, not bc that wouldnt have worked on Yagami and the scene clearly indicated that on top of having Yagami almost getting pieced up by Soma at the beginning of their second fight
Pov the body of people who think its impossible to beat tanimura or shinada in a fight
Aight then
Strawman much ? I'm saying crippling people. A random bum can do that to a random bum, so ofc Shinada does it too
    No it's literally what you're saying, when I said crippling I linked to an example of Shinada punching someone through the air looney tunes style

Though crippling is kinda generous, the force from that punch would put any normal human it hit in the head into quite the coma.
        Nah I'm literally talking about crippling people in general. If I say the sky is blue you're gonna tell me "oh well you're saying there's never been a cloud ?", its just not the same thing talked about
            Then you're just strawmanning what I'm saying...?
                Kinda the opposite
                    No, you're fully just ignoring the actual evidence I was presenting to give context to my point and what I meant in terms of severity in the word cripple to just focus specifically on that word and ignore said evidence.

You're inventing a new argument to go at, that is the definition of strawmanning.
                        Strawmanning is when I say "well, crippling a human is a basic human level feat" and you say "what you think punching someone meters away through a door is a basic human level feat ?"
If you read the full sentence you would see the point. Yk, the part where there's a "but" and I explain whats not taken into account lmao
    Then it's still nothing because it's you arbitrarily deciding what does and what doesn't count for the sake of putting your ego up a fictional character I guess lmao
        No one is beating them gameplay wise bc guns arent guns, knives arent knives and they can just use glitches or use inventory items mid-fight. Very smart.
            Cool...? That wasn't my point, it was that there was many, many non-gameplay instances of them that would be evidence to them ripping off a normal human's head.
                Compromise between feats and antifeats is key
                    And that compromise is these characters are blatantly superhuman and have clearly been presented as since the very inception of the series.

What even is your "compromise" here?
                        Their characters have been seen to be vulnerable enough times to assume they can be beaten without plot armor
He got surprise shot by munakata and wouldve died if not for plot armor gag. That just means he wasnt on guard in the most important moment of his life atp, and I could sneak attack and kill him with a knife or gun. 

2 hours during which he couldve been killed very easily

"Kiryu managed to walk fine with some pain" naaaah thats crazy dude was dying and you had to reach the doc in a short notice before literally bleeding out and dying, on top of that he was barely walking

Pretty much every yakuza protagonist is a criminal somewhat, and saying I could beat a woman shouldnt be different than a man here considering in both cases you'd consider that assault & battery
I'll just pretend I'm homeless to akiyama then. You think he doesnt trust people ? He got done by kido & arai, he let munakata his gun close to him, he gave millions to saejima's sister, he let haruka near park, he lends money to lots of people based on loose tests, shall I continue ?

Yeah Tanimura's different, but he's also way weaker. The only reason I wouldnt go unarmed against him is he'd submit me before I submit him in hand to hand combat, so with a gun I top his superior grappling game

It doesnt change that you can sneak attack akiyama and that he wouldve died without his cash on him lmao

Shinada would know I'm just looking for a fight, he just fw me like that. He was going full force against Daigo, Daigo was the one going easy

I aint looking for any merit making a reddit tierlist
I said ryoma nodiffs me idk why you arguing alone
Yeah thats why they're in that tier. Akiyama aint comparable to Yagami tho
    So wait‚Ä¶are you saying you could beat kaito then? And that you‚Äôre comparable to Soma?
True, checkmate. Although I never played as another character except once and found it dogshit so completely forgot abt it lmao
i'm going to nerd react you now
Oh okay then but yeah Ik he kills me
His best for crowd control and spam heat actions but slugger is stronger overall imo

This is the expected standard of dancing in Kpop/Jpop you can go for it with the break dancing , but I'll admit it's pretty much considered one of THE if not the hardest choreos out there so I'll drop it down a notch or two...

How about this choreo?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcLvorudLfQ

Maybe this one instead? It works better if you've got the long hair for the hairography though

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBSt2ehzkm0

Don't forget you gotta be lip syncing to the song all the way through too...
    I don't need to do allat, have you seen haruka dance ? Yagami takes on her all day long
        Dragon engine does a *lot* of heavy lifting there my dude üòâ
            Maybe, still I could dance better than her and you could to. I know a dude completely out of shape who only spend his time drinking and he has way better dance moves than her
                No "maybe" about it.  PS3 hardware is almost 20 years old at this point, so the animations are severely limited in comparison.

Come back when they release a Kiwami for Y5.
You're amateur level and Shinada is a professional sportsman, his fighting style is the use of weapons AND could literally beat the shit out of an assassin 

Unless you shoot him in the face you don't have a chance against Shinada
    Amateur fighter vs (former) professional baseball player. Because an amateur swimmer is expected to be worse at swimming than a professional golf player üëç great logic

Also let alone reading the post, you couldnt even read whats written next to shinada
Shinada beat Daigo. I get that his role in the plots get memed on pretty often, but Daigo was a final boss for Kiryu and held his own for a decent chunk of time. You'd be delusional to think you could beat the guy who beat him if you aren't an experienced fighter.
    Shinada didn't beat Daigo. Game makes it clear that Daigo was just testing him. Shinada literally faints post-fight
    Shinada doesnt beat Daigo quite the opposite, and Daigo wasnt even a hard fight at all for Kiryu, you're delusional about them more than I might be about myself
        + an amateur fighter means you already have years of training fighting sports so I take experience too
Doesn't know grappling? Have you seen him do Hell's Floor?
    Bro is grappling like he's in a RAW main event, I would't say he knows proper wrestling or bjj
damn, you‚Äôre really selling yourself high huh honestly even aside from the gameplay stuff shinada canonically fought and survived fights most wouldnt even come alive from. These characters aren‚Äôt meant to be realistic when it comes to it because they can fight against an army and win.

I‚Äôd lowkey argue you‚Äôd have more chance winning against Ichiban since he fights in parties so having to fight him solo would probably weaken him down a lot.
    Not really, you're just overestimating raw strength with no technique for koing

Its hard to scale ichiban and he tanked a combined jima attack that I cant match with physical AP thats why I put him there. But I could maybe submit him idk
        ehh if it‚Äôs irl average people/fighter I agree with you but these fictional characters‚Äô strength were never realistic to begin with. Even with gameplay aside, they can still be considered superhuman in what they have achieved, even Shinada. In that universe, seeing how he still won or survived against fighting skilled people while just relying on his raw strength, ill take my chances.
Wait till OP clenches their fist and talks about how no one wins alone, while a montage of all the people who impacted their life float across the screen.
    Shinada is f-ed if that happens.
There's no indication he fought Baba with weapons outside of player choice. The fight even has 3 QTE's, and not once does shinada use a weapon. Instead, he uses his bare hands to counter and stop Baba. 

And don't forget he managed to beat both Komaki's in a 2v1 to limit break (I'd say both komaki's qualify has pros) 

Sure, in the world of yakuza, there are pros that could beat shinada (Tatsuya and Tendo, for example), but any real-life pros would simply not compare, Shinada being a fictional character has levels of strength, endurance and durability that no one in real life can match up to. Again, this is a man who beat multiple combatants at once while said combatants had guns, swords, bats, daggers, etc. (There's a reason pro fighters or trainers will tell you not to engage when faced with a weapon or overwhelming numbers unless absolutely necessary. The risk of death or serious injury is not worth it) 

TL;DR Shinada has beaten pros, and by being a fictional character, is simply stronger and faster than any real-life pro
    Lorewise shinada is mainly using weapons and he has a dedicated moveset for them, just like majima with his knife. The reason they don't have weapons is because then they wouldve to force you to use the particular weapons or make qtes for all different types of weapons, which you shouldnt expect from RGG considering they avoid cost on stuff like that regularly, reusing assets etc

Mmh yeah if you consider the komaki stuff he'd nodiff me but I don't really took that and the arena into account since its not the story canon stuff
        There's nothing that suggests that shinada used weapons for his fights outside of gameplay, and as you said yourself, you're trying to stay close to reality by  ignoring gameplay stuff. Well, in all of shinadas' dynamic sequences (which are required to progress), He doesn't use a weapon
            Gameplay stuff doesnt matter however I think its heavily implied in the story and writing although I might be wrong and since I'm unsure I'm gonna stick to what I said before
    "By being a fictional character he's simply stronger and faster than any pro" with that logic anybody in the yakuzaverse is bc theyre all fiction character, cool to learn sohei dojima & haruto would beat JJ & GSP in a tagteam fight
        I meant fictional characters that fight on the regular
            I fight more regularly than shinada. Bro doesnt fight outside of y5
you are still losing.
    Nah I'd win
Beating some thugs in the street is not out of reach at all, you can and I can do it. Fighting multiple people can be very easy when they're intoxicated, not prepared, not trained, not coordinated, and/or just dumb. If you have 3 serious dudes its a completely different world than 3 dudes in a nightclub
    Did..... Did you played any Yakuza game at all?
        All of them multiple times except rgg online, binary domain and another one.
            Just in Yakuza 1 Kiryu manages to beat up a lot of Yakuza dudes with katanas
                Ok, have you played yakuza 2, 3, 4, 6, and judgment / lost judgment ?
                    I played until 2, but I just recently bought the remasters collection. I'm just waiting for it to install
The man fought a mutant bear and picked a man up by his face, then managed to throw him so hard he knocked over 10 people with that one guy.

Sorry, but... You ain't got a shot in hell, unless you sneak attack + headshot with a gun, but then what's the point.
    And in what tier did I put him
        I mean, you put Ryoma, the guy who parries bullets, who has displayed superhuman levels in terms of cutscenes in:
I could beat him if I had a gun levels
When this guy... Frankly he's a fucking animal in terms of strength and speed, beyond that of a human.
...
Your judgement ain't looking the best kid.
            I said I put him in cooked (forgot he had a gun) 

Just look at ishin's end
            "Kid" do you wear a fedora and smoke cigars ?
                No, I think your the child of a female goat. Duh.
                    ?
Dude literally had the best gun from the time period made by western gunsmiths
    At the time ü§ì

But that aside idk why you even arguing when I said I'd lose to ryoma as soon as I remembered he has a gun
I am aware dawg i even said dont bother arguing how its ‚ÄúnOt ReAlIsTiC‚Äù. No shit, its not, but sure lets say counting cinematography.

You only GET to those cinematic bits by fighting through the armies of men. Your ignoring that, cus that would automatically make it obvious you stand not a snowballs chance in hell against any of them. UFC Champion calibre fighters aint getting through half of what any of them went through in the gameplay youve chosen to completely ignore, which, btw, is like saying you can beat comic batman but like, only counting scenes where he had a broken back okay!!1!1!1!

But fine just cinemtography. Saejima, fought a mutant bear and lived. Saejima fought Baba and Baba didnt automatically die from Saejima laying his bear-beating hands on him. Shinada whooped Baba‚Äôs ass.

Regardless of how you look at it, again, your fucked, because again, these characters are fictional. They have feats and powers that a human being aint coming close to, much less someone who is ONLY the traits you describe.

What if they existed irl, surely you could beat Shinada right? Well what if the world was made of pudding, cus that doesnt matter. There is no way of scaling them that makes any sense other than being willfully ignorant of their superhuman bullshit that patently defies reality.
    Sure, even top UFC fighters can't beat an army of men. But in Yakuza, an army aint shit. One strong dude is better than an army. We have to compromise between our and yakuza's world, and 1v1s in yakuza are much closer to reality than the group fights
        There is no ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù man. Multiple scenes show these regular dudes that make up the armies regularly harass and beat up regular people, because they SCALE as regular people. They aren‚Äôt suddenly weaker, its the protags that are given fictional fighter roids. You need to understand the crux of why you stand no chance: they are fictional. Any compromise you make breaks the canon in the way that makes it so you might as well be just making up new characters in a new media your trying to measure your fighting prowess against. Willfully ignoring the main meat of the games, the gameplay I mean, that would make it so that they completely annihilate you as opposed to just annihilating you, or suddenly deciding that in the world of yakuza numbers don‚Äôt mean shit when, as per your rules, Majima in a CINEMATIC in Kiwami 2 was at deaths door after fighting the army of the Omi alliance, first of all don‚Äôt change anything cus you lose anyway, and second of all DON‚ÄôT MATTER because they are ubermensch. 

By any metric in the world, no matter what you choose to tunnel vision on, they were written to be exceptionally bullshit, and debating whether or not you could beat them rings the same sentiment debating if you could beat Ryu and Ken or Jin Kazama or whatever. You cant, because they are not physically in the realm of humans.
            Aint reading all that big dog but I'm sure you made a great point üôè make a tldr pls
                Lmaoo you don‚Äôt gotta be pretending to be all suave and shit, just stop replying if you got nothing more to say broski, no ones forcing youüòÜ
                    Nah I legit didnt read we hearing each other and I got too many comments dawg
    Saejima went easy on Baba and look at Shinada's face after beating Baba who didnt even want to fight lmao. On top of that realize Shinada was allowed all his weapons

With feats comes antifeats. Sure, kiryu can beat tigers, but he's vulnerable to knives and can die from anyone cutting him. Maybe against him if he had the will to kill me he'd do it before bleeding out, but that'd work on Kaito tier dudes. Its relative, maybe I could kill Kiryu like that hobo almost did, maybe I couldnt (as in he wouldnt fully bleed out before killing me after I cut him) which is what I think. Still stuff like that and other scenes proved you can beat them.

Ofc it doesnt matter its a dumb tierlist on reddit. And no I'm not ignoring their superhuman feats, if I was I wouldnt even have a cooked tier to begin with lmao
        1. No amount of going easy on someone is going to stop them from being absolutely mangled by someone who fights bears. Also why does Shinada have weapons, I thought gameplay scenes don‚Äôt count and as far as I recall, he never uses any in a cutscene. Not that it matters, Mr. Baba is a battery victim from a guy that fought a mutant bear, no iron pipe is hurting him‚Ä¶unless again, Shinada is superhuman, which he absolutely is.

2. Antifeats are everywhere dude, they don‚Äôt suddenly make it so you have a shot. Yeah they can be ambushed, in which case‚Ä¶why bother with the hypothetical. Walk up behind them and shoot them. Kind of pointless then.

3. Yeah your right, it doesn‚Äôt matter, your a grown man you are allowed to be woefully wrong about something. I am also allowed to join in on the silly tier list and say, as per my original comment, you are massively overestimating yourself big dawg.
            I aint saying I fight saejima tho. And yes, by going easy you have ufc fighters kicking and punching an average girl that interviews them, so saejima can hold back against baba and not fight the same as against a bear. Also baba aint getting stronger from that he doesnt have saiyan genes lmao

Antifeats give ways of beating them

Exactly, you're allowed to be wrong
                1. UFC fighters dont compare. YOU dont compare. And btw, how exactly do you picture Babas fight with Saejima? Sure there wasnt a cinematic, but Baba aint a slouch. Was he just treating Baba like how UFC fighters were treating anchor girls? Pretty sure if Saejima were that strong, hed just‚Ä¶never struggle. But he does. Cus im not claiming Baba has zenkai, Im claiming he survived an ass whooping from a guy that beat a bear‚Ä¶cus he is also superhuman. You can read what ive been writing over and over, its all gucci, as many times as you need to understand.

2. Yeah, but in the context of what your talking about they mean nothing. Oh they can be ambushed‚Ä¶so then your only way of winning is by ambushing them‚Ä¶so then whats the point? Why bother with this ‚ÄúYakuza protags I could beat in a fight‚Äù? You already know the answer, based on your antifeats you can ambush em and win. But no, your claiming you can FIGHT them, and lemme tell you unless that ambush is a quick shot to the brain, you cant.

3. If what your gathering is that Im somehow wrong on the topic of if a dude on reddit can beat cartoon superheroes, thats okay, theres no penalty for believing in wrong things. Your allowed to make mistakes my man, your human‚Ä¶which is also why, again you dont stand a chance lmao.
                    OP when Saejima just smacks him with a stop sign he tugged out the floor:
                    Its just an example to say a strong dude can hold back, and the gap between saejima and baba is WAAAAY smaller than the gap between pereira or strickland and the girl interviewing them

The point is having more than 3 tiers and giving interesting alternatives

Cutscenes showed us they're just as vulnerable as us, if you can't see that thats on you
        Kiryu's vulnerable to knives in the sense that he gets hit by a complete non-combatant like random homeless people. Every other time, he's able to just straight up react to whatever shit is thrown at him including bullets at several times. It's just a diff measurement of super human abilities (speed and reaction time).
            Every other time except in y3 which is the only ever time it happens outside of gameplay (ugh maybe majima stabs him too but I dont remember that)
What about Kurohyou 1?
    In k1 enemies dont spam attack you at the same time so its like other yakuza games, groupfights still feel like 1v1
        Yeah, I don't remember Kurohyou 1 that well, guess it's time to play it again
            Finish it in ex-hard with ng+ (only game where I didnt do it by restarting completely, its way harder than the rest of the franchise lmao)
                The Kurohyou games are ruthless
lmao
what does this even mean
    Talking about cutscenes ? Are you acoustic bro
        *autistic
            Thats on purpose
                ![gif](giphy|p58AvYUeCZJ62gL2WK)
                    Its just a funny thing people say, idk why you're making it seem like not a lot of people do it. Are you restarted ?
        your jumble of words does not make any sense
            Aight just forget it then
No it's literally what you're saying, when I said crippling I linked to an example of Shinada punching someone through the air looney tunes style

Though crippling is kinda generous, the force from that punch would put any normal human it hit in the head into quite the coma.
    Nah I'm literally talking about crippling people in general. If I say the sky is blue you're gonna tell me "oh well you're saying there's never been a cloud ?", its just not the same thing talked about
        Then you're just strawmanning what I'm saying...?
            Kinda the opposite
                No, you're fully just ignoring the actual evidence I was presenting to give context to my point and what I meant in terms of severity in the word cripple to just focus specifically on that word and ignore said evidence.

You're inventing a new argument to go at, that is the definition of strawmanning.
                    Strawmanning is when I say "well, crippling a human is a basic human level feat" and you say "what you think punching someone meters away through a door is a basic human level feat ?"
Then it's still nothing because it's you arbitrarily deciding what does and what doesn't count for the sake of putting your ego up a fictional character I guess lmao
    No one is beating them gameplay wise bc guns arent guns, knives arent knives and they can just use glitches or use inventory items mid-fight. Very smart.
        Cool...? That wasn't my point, it was that there was many, many non-gameplay instances of them that would be evidence to them ripping off a normal human's head.
            Compromise between feats and antifeats is key
                And that compromise is these characters are blatantly superhuman and have clearly been presented as since the very inception of the series.

What even is your "compromise" here?
                    Their characters have been seen to be vulnerable enough times to assume they can be beaten without plot armor
So wait‚Ä¶are you saying you could beat kaito then? And that you‚Äôre comparable to Soma?
I don't need to do allat, have you seen haruka dance ? Yagami takes on her all day long
    Dragon engine does a *lot* of heavy lifting there my dude üòâ
        Maybe, still I could dance better than her and you could to. I know a dude completely out of shape who only spend his time drinking and he has way better dance moves than her
            No "maybe" about it.  PS3 hardware is almost 20 years old at this point, so the animations are severely limited in comparison.

                OP when Saejima just smacks him with a stop sign he tugged out the floor:
                Its just an example to say a strong dude can hold back, and the gap between saejima and baba is WAAAAY smaller than the gap between pereira or strickland and the girl interviewing them

The point is having more than 3 tiers and giving interesting alternatives

Cutscenes showed us they're just as vulnerable as us, if you can't see that thats on you
    Kiryu's vulnerable to knives in the sense that he gets hit by a complete non-combatant like random homeless people. Every other time, he's able to just straight up react to whatever shit is thrown at him including bullets at several times. It's just a diff measurement of super human abilities (speed and reaction time).
        Every other time except in y3 which is the only ever time it happens outside of gameplay (ugh maybe majima stabs him too but I dont remember that)
In k1 enemies dont spam attack you at the same time so its like other yakuza games, groupfights still feel like 1v1
    Yeah, I don't remember Kurohyou 1 that well, guess it's time to play it again
        Finish it in ex-hard with ng+ (only game where I didnt do it by restarting completely, its way harder than the rest of the franchise lmao)
            The Kurohyou games are ruthless
Talking about cutscenes ? Are you acoustic bro
    *autistic
        Thats on purpose
            ![gif](giphy|p58AvYUeCZJ62gL2WK)
                Its just a funny thing people say, idk why you're making it seem like not a lot of people do it. Are you restarted ?
    your jumble of words does not make any sense
        Aight just forget it then
Nah I'm literally talking about crippling people in general. If I say the sky is blue you're gonna tell me "oh well you're saying there's never been a cloud ?", its just not the same thing talked about
    Then you're just strawmanning what I'm saying...?
        Kinda the opposite
            No, you're fully just ignoring the actual evidence I was presenting to give context to my point and what I meant in terms of severity in the word cripple to just focus specifically on that word and ignore said evidence.

You're inventing a new argument to go at, that is the definition of strawmanning.
                Strawmanning is when I say "well, crippling a human is a basic human level feat" and you say "what you think punching someone meters away through a door is a basic human level feat ?"
No one is beating them gameplay wise bc guns arent guns, knives arent knives and they can just use glitches or use inventory items mid-fight. Very smart.
    Cool...? That wasn't my point, it was that there was many, many non-gameplay instances of them that would be evidence to them ripping off a normal human's head.
        Compromise between feats and antifeats is key
            And that compromise is these characters are blatantly superhuman and have clearly been presented as since the very inception of the series.

What even is your "compromise" here?
                Their characters have been seen to be vulnerable enough times to assume they can be beaten without plot armor
Dragon engine does a *lot* of heavy lifting there my dude üòâ
    Maybe, still I could dance better than her and you could to. I know a dude completely out of shape who only spend his time drinking and he has way better dance moves than her
        No "maybe" about it.  PS3 hardware is almost 20 years old at this point, so the animations are severely limited in comparison.

Come back when they release a Kiwami for Y5.
+ an amateur fighter means you already have years of training fighting sports so I take experience too
ehh if it‚Äôs irl average people/fighter I agree with you but these fictional characters‚Äô strength were never realistic to begin with. Even with gameplay aside, they can still be considered superhuman in what they have achieved, even Shinada. In that universe, seeing how he still won or survived against fighting skilled people while just relying on his raw strength, ill take my chances.
There's nothing that suggests that shinada used weapons for his fights outside of gameplay, and as you said yourself, you're trying to stay close to reality by  ignoring gameplay stuff. Well, in all of shinadas' dynamic sequences (which are required to progress), He doesn't use a weapon
    Gameplay stuff doesnt matter however I think its heavily implied in the story and writing although I might be wrong and since I'm unsure I'm gonna stick to what I said before
I meant fictional characters that fight on the regular
    I fight more regularly than shinada. Bro doesnt fight outside of y5
All of them multiple times except rgg online, binary domain and another one.
    Just in Yakuza 1 Kiryu manages to beat up a lot of Yakuza dudes with katanas
        Ok, have you played yakuza 2, 3, 4, 6, and judgment / lost judgment ?
            I played until 2, but I just recently bought the remasters collection. I'm just waiting for it to install
I mean, you put Ryoma, the guy who parries bullets, who has displayed superhuman levels in terms of cutscenes in:
I could beat him if I had a gun levels
When this guy... Frankly he's a fucking animal in terms of strength and speed, beyond that of a human.
...
Your judgement ain't looking the best kid.
    I said I put him in cooked (forgot he had a gun) 

Just look at ishin's end
    "Kid" do you wear a fedora and smoke cigars ?
        No, I think your the child of a female goat. Duh.
            ?
There is no ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù man. Multiple scenes show these regular dudes that make up the armies regularly harass and beat up regular people, because they SCALE as regular people. They aren‚Äôt suddenly weaker, its the protags that are given fictional fighter roids. You need to understand the crux of why you stand no chance: they are fictional. Any compromise you make breaks the canon in the way that makes it so you might as well be just making up new characters in a new media your trying to measure your fighting prowess against. Willfully ignoring the main meat of the games, the gameplay I mean, that would make it so that they completely annihilate you as opposed to just annihilating you, or suddenly deciding that in the world of yakuza numbers don‚Äôt mean shit when, as per your rules, Majima in a CINEMATIC in Kiwami 2 was at deaths door after fighting the army of the Omi alliance, first of all don‚Äôt change anything cus you lose anyway, and second of all DON‚ÄôT MATTER because they are ubermensch. 

By any metric in the world, no matter what you choose to tunnel vision on, they were written to be exceptionally bullshit, and debating whether or not you could beat them rings the same sentiment debating if you could beat Ryu and Ken or Jin Kazama or whatever. You cant, because they are not physically in the realm of humans.
    Aint reading all that big dog but I'm sure you made a great point üôè make a tldr pls
        Lmaoo you don‚Äôt gotta be pretending to be all suave and shit, just stop replying if you got nothing more to say broski, no ones forcing youüòÜ
            Nah I legit didnt read we hearing each other and I got too many comments dawg
1. No amount of going easy on someone is going to stop them from being absolutely mangled by someone who fights bears. Also why does Shinada have weapons, I thought gameplay scenes don‚Äôt count and as far as I recall, he never uses any in a cutscene. Not that it matters, Mr. Baba is a battery victim from a guy that fought a mutant bear, no iron pipe is hurting him‚Ä¶unless again, Shinada is superhuman, which he absolutely is.

2. Antifeats are everywhere dude, they don‚Äôt suddenly make it so you have a shot. Yeah they can be ambushed, in which case‚Ä¶why bother with the hypothetical. Walk up behind them and shoot them. Kind of pointless then.

3. Yeah your right, it doesn‚Äôt matter, your a grown man you are allowed to be woefully wrong about something. I am also allowed to join in on the silly tier list and say, as per my original comment, you are massively overestimating yourself big dawg.
    I aint saying I fight saejima tho. And yes, by going easy you have ufc fighters kicking and punching an average girl that interviews them, so saejima can hold back against baba and not fight the same as against a bear. Also baba aint getting stronger from that he doesnt have saiyan genes lmao

Antifeats give ways of beating them

Exactly, you're allowed to be wrong
        1. UFC fighters dont compare. YOU dont compare. And btw, how exactly do you picture Babas fight with Saejima? Sure there wasnt a cinematic, but Baba aint a slouch. Was he just treating Baba like how UFC fighters were treating anchor girls? Pretty sure if Saejima were that strong, hed just‚Ä¶never struggle. But he does. Cus im not claiming Baba has zenkai, Im claiming he survived an ass whooping from a guy that beat a bear‚Ä¶cus he is also superhuman. You can read what ive been writing over and over, its all gucci, as many times as you need to understand.

2. Yeah, but in the context of what your talking about they mean nothing. Oh they can be ambushed‚Ä¶so then your only way of winning is by ambushing them‚Ä¶so then whats the point? Why bother with this ‚ÄúYakuza protags I could beat in a fight‚Äù? You already know the answer, based on your antifeats you can ambush em and win. But no, your claiming you can FIGHT them, and lemme tell you unless that ambush is a quick shot to the brain, you cant.

3. If what your gathering is that Im somehow wrong on the topic of if a dude on reddit can beat cartoon superheroes, thats okay, theres no penalty for believing in wrong things. Your allowed to make mistakes my man, your human‚Ä¶which is also why, again you dont stand a chance lmao.
