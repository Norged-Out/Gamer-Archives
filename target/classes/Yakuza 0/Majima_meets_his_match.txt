[[Majima meets his match]]





Ramsay Everywhere
    Komaki Lambsauce Drop
Essence of Idiot Sandwich
    Show them who's an idiot by slamming bread into their head. Press triangle while in heat mode and having bread in your inventory.
        Shit, that needs to be in Judgement 2
        Nah just use Kiryu ultimate essence with bread gloves
    Fucking Donkey Drop

Finally some good fucking memes.
When does Majima run like that lmao

Looks like kingdom hearts
    That's what you thought of? Not like, Naruto?
        I was thinking Devil May Cry 3
            Same.
        I mean, skyscrapers running didn't happened in Naruto.
            True, might happen in Boruto though surprisingly
        Yes the secret ending to Kingdom Hearts 1 featured skyscraper running and it's part of the battle against the main bad guy in KH2.
        My first thought was sonic adventure.
    In yakuza like a dragon
I bet Gordon would have a goddamn coronary during the part in Y5 when Majima & Saejima are in that yakuniku restaurant and Saejima is letting the meat burn.
    "You've got physical size to match your lack of cooking skills you big fucking donkey."
    This tripe is RAW!
Thought it would be Dio but this is better
    Dio also died from Gordon Ramsey through the same situation.  Time was stopped, but the heat of cooking continues

Are you perhaps referring to this video?
            Yes.
That is the greatest Yakuza meme ever created
I love this so much hahaha

Lamb sauce Everywhere
GORO SANDWICH
Lmao this is great. Someone did the same thing [with DIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ify0ztCyPoo)
Still amazes me that this fucker can run down buildings, create knives out of seemingly nowhere, and fucking clone himself, but almost dies after being shot once
    I think this is Ichibanâ€™s imagination, but honestly if _any_ summon would be real, itâ€™s Majimaâ€™s.

Can i get some help: is *this* what ive been missinf by ignoring the Yakuza games? I think i aquired one of them a year or two ago and it seemed sorta lame, i played it for 15 or 20 minutes and didnt think it was going anywhere. Is this over the top fighting representative of gameplay??
It looks like it was recorded in Cairo, back in 1988.
