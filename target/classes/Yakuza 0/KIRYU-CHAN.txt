[[KIRYU-CHAN!]]





This has to be my favourite version of this meme so far, and extra points for how accurate it is!
    When I saw that meme template, this was the first thing that come to my mind, so I rush to do that meme and that is the result haha If something doesn't exist yet, just do it
I have a love/hate relationship with this post. Thanks, op

    tbh, I just searched "Oldman smiling and neutral meme template" on google images kek
        Bruh

I searched "Jeremy Clarkson happy and angry meme template"

And yes i thought it was him but bald
Mind if I use this as a meme template?
     just use it creatively, and don't do obvious things with it. In other words, renovate this meme :)
This is easily my favorite, and quite possibly the best use of this meme. Nice work.
I had to look this up again because this may be the most perfect use of any meme ever.

Somewhere in the ether of fate and gods, it was decided those pictures and this game series would be made, just to bear this meme into being as a result.
Take my upvote KIRYU-CHANNNNN!
