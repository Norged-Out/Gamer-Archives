The hardest lesson to ever learn.
All captains are expendable.
I still miss my homie Ishmoz from my first run.
    99% of captains are expendable. 

If anything happens to Thrak (he's my one and only nemesis forge Uruk), I will genocide the entirety of Arda.

But as long as I don't send him into Fight pits, he'll never be in any real danger. Anytime he comes along for a siege, I never stray too far from him.
        I‚Äôll never forgive myself for sending my best friend into low level fight pits for a ‚Äúguaranteed win‚Äù he deserved better.
            I learned VERY quickly that Fight Pit AI is trash. There are certain abilities that help, but nothing can help an Uruk who just wants to taunt the whole time.
                Yeah, also that commanders are kinda nerfed in the pits, he really wasn‚Äôt geared for it, plus his squad were hunters, who also are kinda bad in the pits.
                    Hunters are among the better squads from my experience. They don't get in the way of the captain, and they "reload" faster than archers. I'd place them below defenders and berserkers, but above everything else.
                        Yeah the problem I have had in the past with hunters was the same as taunting captains, they just taunted and never threw, wasn‚Äôt all too often, but on that fateful day it was deadly
                one time i had a level 50 fight a level 25 that was vulnerable to the level 50s fire weapon and died because he kept doing that stupid savage taunt every 2 seconds
        Agreed
    I let my niece play (3y/o) every time she almost dies the same uruk saves her. She has never died. On brutal. It's been 2 years since that time. Dude makes a great warcheif. Expendable sure... But loyalty gets rewarded.
its bizarre how well this gif describes the situation lol.

vaulting over dozens of uruks trying to make it, getting waylaid by an enemy captain on the way. Ologs bumrushing you when you try to get the save. 

All the while, "im bleeding bad Bright Lord, dont let me die!"
You should be able to use shadow dominate to heal bleeding. I needlessly lost so many captains during the Shadow Wars because I kept getting hit while trying to save them.

I wouldn‚Äôt mind so much if they didn‚Äôt come back later in a ‚ÄúCheat Death + Betrayal‚Äù claiming I let them die in battle too.
    Why couldn‚Äôt they do the ability‚Äôs like fallout and let you choose how to hit
    This would be such a useful mechanic. I've lost too many captains just because I couldn't stay still long enough to heal them.
    Shadow dominate to heal?  Why the hell didn't I think of that?  I have risked life and limb more than once to save a captain.  Thanks for that.
        Idk what you‚Äôre thanking me for when my complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt work, hence why so many captains have died on me üòÇ.
            Oh so Shadow Dominate doesn't work to heal?  I thought you had shared something handy I didn't know
                No such luck, I'm afraid. Wish it did work like that tho, would have saved me a LOT of dead captains...
                    most of my bleeding captains have been ones I said to stay and fight with me, and when a quest comes that takes me back to that fortress or camp, he is still there.  If he survives (and so far I haven't lost one to my knowledge), I always deploy him elsewhere, since they always seem to take on anyone and everyone to fight.
                if a captians about to go down, you can shadow dominate to retreat!
    I agree. It especially sucks on elite difficulty I'm using now. They bleed out SO fast
I absolutely love how the orcs were brought to life in these films, but this gif really highlights that some of the deep background ones actually looked like guys in silly Halloween masks. Look to the left of Legolas lol
To accurate
Dude this gives me the worst fucking feeling ever. Especially during the animation before they die and you don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll get decapitated or if you‚Äôll be able to resurrect them.
I have literally restarted my game so many times because I didn‚Äôt want to lose certain Captains
Man, I hope the Lord of the Rings MMO that's rumored to be in the works has just the best open world ever. Like imagine Breath of the Wild level maps for each region. Like imagine you're standing at the edge of the Lorien woods and you can see the Erebor to the north and the great grasslands of Rohan to the south, with the dark clouds of Mordor looming over horizon to the east. And just like in BOTW, you **can** actually go there
    Rip my graphics card lol
And then you're too late and they bleed out. Only for them to come back a few hours later and betray you. I TRIED TO SAVE YOU, DAMN IT. I LOVE YOU. STOP HAVING IRON WILL.
Look how jank that orc looks behind Legoloas. Looks like something out of The Labyrinth with David Bowie.
    Imagine using a comparison to Labyrinth as a negative.
        God I hate that movie. Used to scare the shit out of me as a kid.
            Same, that and the Dark Crystal were the reason for 95% of my childhood night terrors.

Doesn‚Äôt mean it was badly made.
It hurts knowing you won't make it in timeüòî
Just kill every uruk around you
I know that feel. Have had to exit the game when one of my captains died. Stupid flag orcs.
Relatable
Whenever one of my captains is downed I always switch to Waters of Lorien or the nazgul helmet that gives that effect and dash through all orcs until I get close, and then change to all armors, effects and skills that let me drain faster and/or stun all orcs around
OOF
I've done a playthrough where I try to play as a heartless leader, not really caring for my orcs and if they were fair away, wouldn't even care to revive them... that was before my favorite orcs, Tarz and Tarz died, I'm still doing heartless run but I teared up after getting that death message
So true
When I see my op body guard Olog cursed tank with war banners just getting fucked up during a battle while I‚Äôm fighting 5 war chiefs  üò¢
MF WHY IS THIS EVERY SINGLE F'IN SIEGE/DEFENSE
I hate it more that the game will choose to use the ability on everyone but the orc right infront of you. It will even grab the orc behind him at times, it drives me insane
Only for them to come back and betray me and then blame me for there deaths.
