[[Really do be like that]]





Good meme but they paint it red when infiltrating though
    I  thought blue and red was just for the player to tell the difference, and your orcs aren't actually changing color
        In the first game, that could have been the case because dominated orcs and regular orcs interact as normal before you get noticed. This was likely due to AI being simplified so as to not bog down the game, but they did change it in the next game.
        Could be, but you'd think that they atleast have the brain capacity to change colours haha
        woosh
    Thanks
Because it's in my name!  Uga Kuga the Blue!!!  You thing Gubu the Red gets asked why he is wearing red??? Its my whole Tarking Identity!  I don't have a last name so I'm named for the fact that I always wear blue!  What's with all the questions... now just drink some of that grog... the one over there with the green smoke coming out of the bucket.
    It's funny because I'm pretty sure theres an orc captain with the title "the blue"
        There is, there is probably a post of him matched up in the pits against "the Red". 

I've had several "the Blue" while green armor and paint is "Frog Blood" or similar, Yellow I believe is "of the Caves" and purple is "Regal". Red and blue are much less creative with their names aparently.
            Also:

The Wasp - Yellow

Ice-Mountain - White

The Blizzard - White
                I've had yellow on spider killers before.
            Red vs Blue
    And another thing, how about ar-benu of the misty mountains is like ice grey, ishmoz gold tooth paints himself gold which is just stupid, tarz the guardian of mordor is painted bla- oh you’re choking? Good *attacks the other bodyguard* for the bright lord!
        Personally, while Goldtooth is rather bland, I’d take any excuse to recruit him and give him a gang because I love painted bosses having grunts with matching paint. Though the Red, Blue, Frogblood, and whatever orcs have black paint probably have much cooler grunts.
            That’s why ishmoz the red and his fire wielding band of elite defenders head the spear of my assault forces, and that is why he never fails, not because of his great immunities or few weaknesses or even his elite guard, but because he paints himself red with the blood of his enemies.

Ishmoz: that and I won’t stab him in the back like brüz.

That too.
                Hey, if you know, could you tell me one thing? Do you know if orcs with elaborate tattoos such as “The Painted” or “The Rogue” can have grunts with that pattern or is it only with plain paint smears?
                    I had a dude named "The Unashamed" and his goons had his custom paint scheme
                        That sounds awesome. Guess I have no choice but to experiment with the next Rogue and Painted I encounter.
    Why did i read this with the sound of an angry captain
This made me laugh like my dog pants
    Why do you have dog pants? What even are dog pants?
        Maybe like the way their dog pants? Not actual dog pants. At least that's my guess
            Yes the way

Anyway I found this hilarious
I have "The Red" for so long and never betrays me but "The Blue" betray me after I come back and check the region, something about I am weak or some shut like that, smh
    I got 2 captains to betray a warchief once, mission was like butter and I dominated the warchief as well. I fast traveled to do a couple missions and when I came back all 3 assaulted me, idk I thought it was cool, brutalize killed them though
"It's not a fase, mom!!!"
