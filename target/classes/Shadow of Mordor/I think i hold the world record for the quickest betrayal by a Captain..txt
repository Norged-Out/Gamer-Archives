[[I think i hold the world record for the quickest betrayal by a Captain.]]





I reckon you just might
    I wish i diddn't. I wanted this dude for overlord
        So you ended up killing him?
            After he turned on me he had iron will so i shamed him until he was level 51 to remove it. But in doing so he developed a mortal weakness too headshots. I recruited him told him to stay and fight for me. Then ran like 200M away and put him down with one arrow. It was sad as i ruined him. It was like in OMAM where George shoot's Lenny. I coulnd't look i just let him bleed out. But i kept his armour in remembrance of him 😥.
                Could have levelled him up to try to remove the weakness? Not sure if that's worth it anymore though.
                    i did, i recruited at 51. Saw the weakness and leveled him to 80 it did nothing 😥. I realised and had to to an old yeller 😥.
                        Yeah I hate that about this game. Any orcs that are a higher level than me especially 80+, I just write off and kill.

Shaming will always cause them to be worse off than they started and you can never get back the strengths they lose. 

So stupid.

Plus I hate having a handprint on their face. Looks dumb.
                I wish you’d recorded that, that would have been priceless.
                I found the way to avoid that is Shame (not worse than death) then death threat them over and over again, till they’ll lose iron will, I also had a captain that kept on coming back with no vulni and had lots of immunity and enrages, shamed him till level 1 and he never really got his old stats back and he was basically just trash to me
                    Does the death threats remove anything or is that just to keep encountering them?
                Omg I'm reading OMAM for my English class, and this is how I get the ending spoiled? On a 2 year old post?? On the shadow of mordor subreddit??? One day away from reading the last chapter???? At 11:05pm?????
                Well against orcs that might not be a problem, if you give him thick skin or defenders it could be just fine
Big brain strat, used the gravewalker to heal him, then turned round and started the fight anew
    i.. i need a shower i feel so used 😳
Plot twist he was iron will but faked it
    Yeah some bs like that
    He should be considered a "Trickster".
"I swear allegiance to you"

LITERALLY 12 seconds later: *Betrayal any% speedrun*
    Not even 12.  I went back, it was 7.  0:29 to 0:36.
        The poor mans combo counter didn’t even have time to expire before the betrayal
That was a VERY temporary arrangement
He's a keeper
    No, i had to put him down 😥
"I always saw my service to you as a... temporary arrangement."

Ya don't say
You actually just might have done it
Lol, he was literally just like "YOU THOUGHT"
Ran off, stopped, thought "Hang on, what the fuck am I doing" and turned straight back
Reads title : "That's clearly an Outlaw captain" GG on the WR !

In my entire time playing this game and being on this subreddit I have never seen this happen before, holy crap. Congratulations on the recording of this bug which may one day lead to someone discovering a method to speed run the game 0.53 frames quicker.
I actually had this happen to me too, a trickster immediately betrayed me after recruiting him.
    I mean he is a trickster
"sigh, here i go again"
"I swear allegiance to you." He says, trying to hold back a laugh.
Betrayal words can really hurt
That's the Outlaw tribe for you.
Where are you
    The sandy area!, far right of the map.
        Oh thanks
Happened with me as well. It was in Seregost.
When he said he intended it to be temporary, he wasn't kidding...
You must have bad benefits for your army
Top 10 anime betrayals
Is it just me but the captain’s face changes after the betrayal?
I HAD MY STUMPY FINGERS CROSSED THE WHOLE TIME!
"Temporary arrangement" in his words aka around 10 seconds.
Wow you definitely have the record
I had a “The Stitch” olog betray me at a very similar speed
I am new to this subreddit, figured out I would see if there is a subreddit for my favorite game.
You are the first meme I have seen on this subreddit, and I thank you for that.
Rip
It took 4 seconds, I‘ve gotten 1 betrayal in the whole game and I beat it already, it took a few hours.
He literally said “Sike”
I had captain that betrayed me second's after I dominated him and took his fort 😐 but this is way faster
Lmao he said SIKE
I actually have done worse so I got an olog recruited then his blood brother came along I recruited his blood brother then he betrayed me. He helped me fight his brother throughout the fight then he betrays me
That bravado...
That cunning...
The fact he cant even hold in his laughter... 
That ologs the closest thing to bruz ive seen in mordor and you should forever curse the day you had to put him down!

Gratz on your record though!
"I swear allegiance to you!"

*So that was a fucking lie*
didn't even give a 2 week notice

    Elven Light un upgraded

*Spoilers*

End game your light blue Celebrimbor wraith is replaced with a green one as you become a wraith yourself and he abandons you.
        Meh, I didnt like him anyway. So you're on your second run through?
            Yeah around 140 hrs overall 😊
Wait, how do you have a curse elven light?
    I don't, it's just the basic version of it, it's part of what makes Wrathgiver so disgusting 🤣

Can I ask what is your armor and cloak is ?
    The Black Servent's Armor and the cloak is Shadestalker.
I've had a captain I've shamed ambush me 10 seconds later saving me time to recruit him to my army
No that would be me, this guy and his blood brother were in the same area I recruit one then like 5sec later I kill the other blood brother and 5sec later he betrays me
I shamed a captain and he ambushed me quicker than that
What map is this? I got the platinum trophy but cant remember this environment
    Lithlad, it's included in the Baranor dlc
Wait does Tailon talk when dominating people after losing Celebrimbor?
I have something similar. I killed this one's blood brother and then recruited him as my body guard. Surely nothing bad would happen? No, he betrayed me as soon as I summoned him
At least yours betrayed you before anything happened, I got a guy who I wanted to use for the arena, trained him up, and then proceeded to get betrayed.
This is literally how fast I got betrayed by one dude, but he came back in a "Rebellion" with 3 other guys that were pissed off because I demoted them from their war chief positions. Luckily, I happened to have my 3 best orcs there helping me out, so there were a bunch of loose heads left when the battle was over.
I had one just as fast but worse cause he also killed one of my other orcs
Same thing happened to me because I was fighting two captains I didn't know were blood brothers. I recruited one, told him to retreat, instantly knocked off my feet the first hit I gave to his brother.
What skin is that?
Ik this is a year old but i think i just broke your record i dominated this olog commander turned around after sending him away and hes allready betrayed me standing behind me saying how hes sick of taking orders from me
Bro turned around and said “Nah fam im good”.
What map is this?
    its part of the DLC
Definitely 

I also have a quick betrayal.

So I fought an orc and his blood brother appeared 
(They where level 29 and 30 I am 30)

I recruited the first and let him stay to help me
Fough his brother, tried to recruit and saw that he was to high level
So I executed him... I turn around and my orc was the enemy again and he gained the iron will trait..
Dang, and I thought the one who betrayed me 45 seconds later because I was fighting his blood brother was fast.
Sucks that you had to loose him to shaming. It’s rare to not get any downsides from an orc losing that many levels.
LOL one time I recruited an Uruk during a quest to kill a warchief. I hit the warchief once and the Uruk I recruited not two seconds ago said something along the lines of “no one messes with my blood brother” and killed me 💀
Blud had iron will, he just didn’t tell you lmao
Where is this desert region?
Commie bastard
“I swear allegiance to you” 

*orc turns to the camera* what’s up guys this is Az-Laar, back with another epic prank video, today were pranking the gravewalkwer….
Is it me or does his face change appearance
That's why I almost always have them stay and fight even if there's nobody around
I wish i diddn't. I wanted this dude for overlord
    So you ended up killing him?
