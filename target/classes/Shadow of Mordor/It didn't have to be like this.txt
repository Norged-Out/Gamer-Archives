[[It didn't have to be like this]]





I‚Äôve had my first best friend come back from the dead and betray me, I was depressed after that
    Imagine someone saying this irl during a zombie apocalypse! Wild
    I had a orc come back from the dead and not betray me
        I love those guys
            I know right
        Those are the ones to hold on to. Loyalty above all else, no matter how mortally vulnerable to sneezing they may be. ‚ù§
        me too
It's Treason, Then.
    Death penalty: activated.
        Nah fuck that cowards get the death penalty traitors get the penalty of getting mind fucked
            Ah yes spending half an hour endlessly tracking down and defeating an orc till they're level 1
            I prefer mindfucking murderers. Like in that one episode of Black Mirror, White Bear.
me: "its doesn't have to be this way! there must be another way!" 

orc: gain [Iron Will]

me: *sob "SUFFER ME NOW!"

orc *scream [Madness]
    Maniac lvls granted. Lvl 85
    I read that suffer me now with Talions voice in my head
        COWARDLY ORC!
            YOU ARE NOT WORTHY OF MY BLADE!!
        Why would you not read it with Celebrimbor voice? üòû
            *BECAUSE OF THE ENDING*
    RIP: Z√ªgor the Corruptor, the best orc in mordor
Happened for me with Ur-Dag the painless, my OG overlord who died in the fight pits, but he had Iron Will, so I had to shame him, he lost his mind so I decided to put him out of his misery rather than live with a bag on his head muttering gibberish
This actually happened last time I played the game a few weeks ago.

My boy Zunn the War Bringer was a Defender Warmonger back from my Shadow of Mordor days. When I got him, I treated him right. Never an infiltrator, always my bodyguard, always at my side leading sieges, murdering captains, commanding his own bois. I went to Lithladd and just had Zunn with me on a murder spree to slaughter all the low level captains. Everything was fine and dandy, we were a team, a dynamic duo.

Hell, my favorite memory is when I got ambushed by a legendary Olog after using intel on him, and the guy downed me quite handedly. I was about to die when suddenly Zunn popped out, stabbed him through the fucking throat and bashed his neck in so hard he decapitated him.   
"Just doing my job boss!"

I loved this orc.

Then one day I'm raiding the fort all on my lonesome, having fun mostly in between trying to get wrathgiver, when suddenly I hear a cough, my camera pans to an orc with a familiar helmet. I was like "Who dis?"  
Then I saw the name.

"Your army is strong... but it needs an Uruk leading it!"

Zunn, for no reason, out of the fucking blue (pun intended) betrays me in the middle of me raiding a fort! And lemme tell you, fighting this legend of an uruk was not easy. Yet amazingly, I was able to break him, dominate him, and recruit him back right then and there.

I know not why my favorite orc warrior decided to suddenly break our bond... but if you think I'm a softy for re-recruiting him and not making an example of him, you're dead wrong. I may have taken him back out of fondness for the memories, but Zunn is gonna have to work his ass off to earn my favor again. I've stripped him of his titles, I've removed him as my bodyguard. He will not own warchief, he will never be overlord, and now he's on a penance crusade to rid Mordor of my enemies... without my help.

He will spill a sea of blood to regain my favor, and we will see if history remembers him afterwards.
    Love the poetry of this story arc :)
Ronk The Rugged. Got him halfway through the main story and kept him ever since as my favourite. Kept levelling him up and giving him strengths and stuff when I could. Although, by the end of the game, just before I was gonna start my last siege battle during the shadow wars, he betrayed me. So I killed him, and he came back after the battle with iron will. I ended him once and for all. The best orc I ever had. Kept saving me after losing all my last chances, was easily my most powerful orc that killed any captain within a matter of seconds. Miss that guy
    All your last chances? You have more than 0?!
        Whatever their called. The thing when you lose your health and a captain is about to kill you, but a friendly captain kills them. And yes I have a couple (in my first play through of course, after that I don‚Äôt use any)
            I know lol, but I‚Äôve been playing Gravewalker and omfg getting 1 shot by a throwing knife and not having any chance to survive is a horrible feeling. If a dominated orc saves me somehow I always promote them
                Oh yea. I hate that difficulty with a passion. I couldn‚Äôt get past Minas Ithil without lowering the difficulty
                    I‚Äôm 55% done and going strong, the trick is stealth mode whenever possible, and run a fire critical build to take out most captains, with a poison set in case they are immune to burning.

It‚Äôs my first playthrough as well on SoW so diving right into Gracewalker has had its toll on me, 55% 20 hours
                        I haven't played on Gravewalker, but I've heard how painful it is. Props to you for jumping into the gutter straight away :D
Dude if my guy, Bolg the vatkeeper betrayed me I would cry, he is so important to me, but he brings me gifts so he is max loyalty, I doubt he'll ever betray me.
    There's actually a loyalty meter? I need to find out hoa to fill this up I'm new to the game üòÇ
Man fuck that I turn into Bishop from Juice. No remorse
When I get a favorite ork, or a ork proves themself to me, I retire them. I had a duo who fucked shit up during a quest and just insta finished a fight so they were retired. I had a ork save my life and kill three other captains who were in the process of making me their bitch, they were retired as well. 

My orks who do well get to relax on the beach, drink grog, eat tarks who are prepared by the best chefs, and commit atrocities to their hearts content on hobbits.
I had orc who cheated death and didn‚Äôt betray me the sad part all what he say is ( you didn‚Äôt give chance i don‚Äôt have any chance...)
F.
How do you prevent orc betrayal? Pick a loyal one? Which ones are loyal?
    There's no real way to prevent betrayal. If you have too many Dominated Orcs in one area, however, you risk a Rebellion and most of them turning on you.

As for loyal ones, there's one sure fire way to keep them loyal. Ever hear the story of Talion the Betrayed? (Undying Loyalty)
        It‚Äôs an Orc legend
            Not one the Elves would tell you
My first overlord, Krimp the Rhymer. When I lost the siege of Nurnen he got captured and I failed to save him from execution (stupid controls...). He came back and betrayed me for not saving him and I honestly couldn't blame him. So I did my best not to kill him and recruited him back since he didn't gain iron will. And then we reconquered the region and he again became my loyal overlord.
Specially a good one. Some betrayed me and died where they stood. Some others betrayed me and I ran for it or died. Then levelled up some more, got some intel, recruited some more Orcs and waited in the fortress as that is what usually happens. Getting ambushed in a friendly fortress letting your grunts and captains take the heavy brunt off. The only job you need is to make sure some of your guys die and to make sure to deal damage but freezing the enemy in place with the arrow shot too the foot. Works every time
I didn't have him betray me... but my boy Garl good Thinker, who thunk good, was slaughtered in battle and I couldn't save him. I remember as well, he was risen as an undead in the final zog mission. I couldn't bring myself to end him so I purified the totems and let those take him.
It's not just that they betray you. It's that they betray you and then have Iron Will and have to be shamed at least twice
    Only twice? If your my favorite orc and you betray me your going to S U F F E R
I had an orc by the name of dugz iron-shield. On the siege of Seregost he bled out on battle and I never noticed him. He came back to life seeking revenge and tried to kill me. He said these words ‚Äúfine go ahead and kill me, but please bury me with my shield‚Äù. I killed him and never thought about it. Until he came back to life again, he had a metal helmet on and he was an amazing orc. When I defeated him he said ‚Äúwell, I put up a good fight didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù. I intentionally messed up the quick time event and let him go. He has iron will now but I will never kill him.
*turns off worse than death and procceeds to bitch slap*
Had me a rebellion earlier. 3 of my own guys decided to gang up on me and betray me simultaneously. Unfortunately, they seem to always forget that I know their deepest, darkest fears.
Those 2 ologs that come after you after you shame bruz. I shamed them into oblivion. One went down to level 1 and I accidentally stealth killed him, the other got down to level 11 then execution fucked me over of the torture of this one particular olog. Theyre both dead and I REALLY hope they cheat death.

Another one is Az-lag the pit fighter. He was one of my stronger captains, but he betrayed me so I killed him. Later on, he ressurects as Az-lag the beast. Apparently he survived and "The beasts of mordor came to feast on me,one by one. I fought them off and survived! Now I will kill you for what you did" or something like that. He was actually pretty strong now so I recruited him. He's one of my prized warcheif's now. No-one messes with Az-lag the beast.
I‚Äôve never been seen that movie but I can tell it‚Äôs the best.

God man, for a game about slashing 30 appendages off in under 30 seconds there sure are a lot of gut-twisting moments with orcs that the game straight up created artificially

This game has such life to it
When the Bard and the Poet both betray you and you can't stand to see them go deranged or maniacal
I just make them mine again, if possible (and they don't suck)
*Uruk
I had an orc like this name grisha the scorpion he would travel with me to all regions and help attack  and defend forts 
one day he betrayed me and killed me I had to shame he broke now all he does is laugh but he still the same grisha to me
That‚Äôs always a sad moment. Had a body guard who died because I couldn‚Äôt save him, he came back and betrayed me.
Too real üíî
I get hyped - like "so... the time has come then?".
so you have chosen the path of pain
I once had an olog who would just repeat various phrases with the word "Mordor" in them. It sounded like he wanted to have Mordor for himself, so I let him be the overlord of one of my fortresses. Then he betrayed me, but I still felt bad for him. I made sure his death was swift.

"Mordor... Mordor... Is mine..."

He just wanted Mordor. :(
It hurts more when your favorite orc goes on a siege mission with you and your unable to get to your dieing comrade cause of all the chaos going on. Then as he dies you complete the siege. Shortly after he escapes death and betrays you to the point he has iron will.
Just re-recruit him, kill him, then resurrrct him as a revenant. That way he'll never leave you...
My favourite ork betrayed me today why did you have to remind me
Had this happen to me once. Got betrayed by an Olog that I had spent hours perfecting. Made him Epic, gave him a gang, gave him a fire weapon, carefully leveled him up and got rid of any easy-to-exploit weaknesses, and was just about to promote him to Overlord when he betrayed me. Well, I had done too good a job forging him into the perfect warrior because he wrecked my shit in about 5 seconds flat. I was just about to die to him when out of nowhere some pissant Uruk I had recruited on a whim just busts in and fucking bodies the Olog. He then says something to the effect of "I never liked that Tark anyway." It's when you're at rock bottom that you discover who really has your back.
So far I've only been betrayed by some rando I didn't even want in my army, but if one of my boiz try to butcher me, Imma be hella upset.
I just shamed them multiple times until their Iron Will went away so i could recruit them again, they were an obsessed orc and i wanted to make my lover the Overlord
Bruz the chopper, I absolutely wanted him to be my overlord
My orc Rug The Obsessed betrayed me so i beat him, shamed him several times and recruited him again. Still love him
My very first Plague-Bringer broke my heart.
I found a oolog with purple paint and gold armor, kinda looking like thanos and recruted him, shortly after he betrayed me and gained iron will. Then while storming that bridge there were too many enemies so I had to kill himüò≠
