[[Why I love this game!]]





I had one cheat death to save me today. He had died in a previous seige that went sideways.
    Same that happened to me he said that he had come back from the dead to serve me again
        That happened to me too, but I wasn't aware he returned to serve me so I started hitting him until I realised he was actually on my side.
            Haha
            I did the exact same thing to one that just appeared and was like "death can't stop me" or something.
                Yeah I guess we just have an instinct to kill an orc captain when a random cut scene appears out of nowhere
        Thats lit af my dude
        Lucky all mine just come back to kill me at the worst times
            I killed bruz and now he hunts me he‚Äôs cheated death about 5 times to kill me
                I decided to shame all three of his brothers to level 1 it took a while but it was worth it seeing them drown in sorrow
                    Jesus you fit right into Mordor you monster!
                        I think i may now know why everyone keeps betraying me
                            Yeah lol
                                I still say they deserved it they all 3 attacked while i was in my fort alone i shame one and they all ran away
                                    lol honestly I would just execute then
                My bruz died to a groug when I was trying to re-recruit him. I was so sad. Eventually I was avenging my friend and his bruz ambushed me, but he had iron will so I shamed him and hung around in my friend's world until he came back then I recruited him and now he's safely tucked away in my garrison mumbling to himself about MY fort
                Your lucky see i was bored and decided lets make a godly enemy and well it took a few hours but i killed bruz yes i used bruz becuase he was already a ok level and had 3 immunites but by the end he was immune to everything and could one shot you i killed him because i knew hed be back
                    I honestly re recruited him then he betrayed me at the worst time I killed him about 5 times and he‚Äôs come back every time but then yesterday I killed him again but he has not come back yet I think he‚Äôs dead this time for good honestly I‚Äôm a bit sad
                Just get him on your side. I got unlucky and lost mine in a siege
I have this guy named Hoshgrish the Large, died in the fight pits, later on in fighting in a camp raid, I‚Äôm losing, guess who shows up? Hoshgrish with an Axe in his head and burn marks, wanted to serve me again after cheating death, he was Fiery Slayer but got the can be killed instantly by fire thing cause that‚Äôs how he died, trusted him too much, sent him into the fight pits killed himself with his own fire, that was a week ago, fast forward to yesterday, trying to turn some guys to legendary via online fights, while I‚Äôm running over there, Hoshgrish comes back to serve me once more, I didn‚Äôt make him overlord only because I don‚Äôt like Machine fortresses but I am considering it, love you Hoshgrish
    You need to make him overlord his loyalty has to be rewarded
    Guys the same dude awarded this comment 6 times and it‚Äôs starting to creep me the fuck out because I don‚Äôt who he is and he‚Äôs starting to reply to a lot of my older comments, ***help me***
        Award-ka the Obsessed
            Bro this was 2 years ago-
                Lets make up for lost time
                Bro this was half a year ago
                Bro this was 11 months ago
    Wait, does the overlord determine the type of fortress? Mind blown.
        Yeah, their appearance is also upgraded))
            Imho machine is the coolest, its a factory
Meanwhile my guys just starts fucking laughing at my dumbass, but they are always there for another go at the fort with me. "sniff" the best bros i could wish for.
    lol the best type of friends
    Once the game glitched and the overlord became my spy but he acted like a normal  overlord
        Sounds about right for this game, is it wrong, yes it is, but does it ruin it? no it improvises. lovely.
Damm,great story
Sometimes this game has absolutely fantastic attention to detail and really tight coding.

Other times it gives you beastmasters with a fear of caragors.

EDIT: Nvm. It's fake.
    Yeah lol
Asgar and the last line in the story are not coded into this game.
    Idk he might be lying then
    But how do you know
        A quick look at A names on the wiki shows no name, and look at lines from those who save you. It's not there.
            I'm pretty sure they mean ashgarn
            This could be a lie
            This is not my comment
The name ‚ÄòAsgar‚Äô isn‚Äôt coded into Shadow of War.
    Furthermore, the savior dialogue of ‚Äútold you I won‚Äôt forgot it, doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù

This story is completely fabricated
        Which is such a weird thing to lie about since this type of situation can and does happen.
            Yeah it was probably just an attempt to make the nemesis system seem more adaptive than I actually is
                I have had a decent amount of saviours. However I have never heard the line ''told you I won‚Äôt forgot it'' despite having over 500 hours in the game. So I wouldn't be suprised if the story was fake.
                But damn its believable
        Well I don‚Äôt know but why would someone lie about that shit
            Can‚Äôt tell you why exactly, since I‚Äôm not the guy who wrote the original comment. I can only tell you that he definitely was lying
            Is this your first day on the internet? 

People lie about the most ridiculous things. In this case, it's relatively harmless.
                I remember that one kid that lied about him having brain cancer for karma
    Probably tried to say ashgarn but its easier to say asgar
        Idk
Nothing will be forgotten
I Was saved by the "forgey the orc slayer" and he was truly a hero.
    Never got saved by him hoping one day
        I got saved by him in my first play through, havent seen him since.
This game is the fucking best, dude!
    It‚Äôs fake I‚Äôm so sorry guy just straight up lied
        Damn, it is? That sucks... And for what purpose did this person lie anyways?
            Idk attention?
                That's just stupid...
Hoglik the slayer killed me in a cheap shot after I took on 3 captains in a ambush mission and was betrayed by my body guard. Then after they had me within an inch of my life this guy swings in and kills me. Naturally pissed off I set off to shame the ever living fuck out of hoglik. Accidentally kill him. He cheats death. Almost 5 times we have this dance of shaming and killing (mostly accidental) until one day he ambushed me as ‚ÄúHoglik the unashamed‚Äù after shaming him 20+ times he had enough and became legendary in addition to the new name. Our rivalry goes on for several more encounters with me kicking his ass and then shaming him until it works again. Well. Now look who‚Äôs my new [Overlord](https://imgur.com/gallery/iHtfc7X). (Note he was a fairly normal looking red skinned orc when I first encountered him.)
Even tho this is prob fake, I have had a pretty cool interaction with Am√∫g the Avenger
    It is most likely
Man, I keep coming back to this game after countless hours of playing because of posts like this. A game with amazing replay value is hard to come by these days.
Just beat mordor today, and my nemesis was a captain named Thakrak. He had already cheated death, and his voice line for the finale was: ‚ÄúThis ranger will break you,condemn you to endless pain, and then refuse to kill you. Slaughter the blue demon!‚Äù Really badass but also kinda sad at the same time.
That is wholesome
\*everyone liked that\*
not today thrak
Meanwhile, I get stuck on barrels, and my mid combat drains target ologs behind me when I'm holding forward and looking right at uruk in front of me.... then I die. And I pass my last stand, but get hit immediately before I can even roll, and die for real. I love the game... but im still mad about that one from yesterday.
Holy shit bro lol. That‚Äôs why this game Shadow of War rules.. there are SO many outcomes and possibilities that I am STILL finding almost what.. 4 years later?!
I didnt have anybody on my team, or even a bodyguard. I was trying to go for the "get killed 3 or more times then recruit" trophy, but everytime I would go down for the 3rd time, a mysterious orc(s) would come save me then never to be seen again. I finally figured out I needed to change my settings so I cant be rescued
This game is just a relationship sim in disguise.
Awsome
Damn, I really have to get around to playing this game.
Why can't this magical thing happen for me?!üò≠üò≠
Lol my orc followers are always betraying me. Apparently I leave them for dead a lot
I've been saved twice by some dude with a weird guitar who said something like "in another life we would be enemies"
The Uruks in Shadow of War are really cool. I always feel bad when they‚Äôre near death.
It‚Äôs enough to make a grown man cry and that‚Äôs ok
    It‚Äôs enow to maketh a grown sir caterwauling and that‚Äôs tis fine

why is THIS making me cry lmao
Orcs are such bros
This game genuinely has some of the best in-world story telling out there...whether it be through the nemesis system or the incredible NPCs, like Shelob or Baranor, or almost anyone except fucking Eltariel who is kind of just a cunt 99% of the time
Forthog saved me from the gorgoroth overlord
He was a firey savage with an oolog squad who was 5 lvls above me,he beat the shit out of me and he was gonna get me with no chance and forthog saved me and I could take gorgoroth 
I will never forget that and is why I will always defend him
On my most recent playthrough, I had an Uruk who was discovered as a spy and executed. Yesterday, I'm in a fight, and all of a sudden I just hear "BOSS!"

 It's the Uruk. I expect him to try to kill me for letting him die. Nope. He says, "I came back from the dead to serve you once more, My Lord. I...figured I should just let you know that." and then proceeded to fucking demolish the Olog and Uruk I was in the middle of fighting. He is my favorite bodyguard now.
I had one who cheated death 3 times to save me and he is my most powerful uruk
I had come back from the dead just to betray me I hope something like this happens to me
I love the stories that come out of this game. Probably one of the only game I enjoy dying and playing on brutal.
The Return of The King
This is like the most immersive "this shit is real" crap I've heard in a video game... no wonder the nemesis system is so great they copy righted it!
That is truly AMAZING.
I am so crazy about the nemesis system. It sucks Warner Brothers trademarked it only to never use it again.
Cheat death should be off ask the time.
I recently figured out that if you keep a orc as your bodyguard long enough he‚Äôll start to do this when you‚Äôre about to die
Unfortunate how the top post in this sub is fake
reminds me of the time i was about to killed by a ‚ÄúNo Chance‚Äù captain, then all of a sudden the camera zooms about a hundred feet away to one of my archers, Hoshgrish Lucky-Shot, and he just says nonchalantly ‚Äúalways got your back boss‚Äù and then headshots the orc who was about to kill me üò≠ gave him a fire weapon for his troubles
Same that happened to me he said that he had come back from the dead to serve me again
    That happened to me too, but I wasn't aware he returned to serve me so I started hitting him until I realised he was actually on my side.
        Haha

    Lucky all mine just come back to kill me at the worst times
        I killed bruz and now he hunts me he‚Äôs cheated death about 5 times to kill me
            I decided to shame all three of his brothers to level 1 it took a while but it was worth it seeing them drown in sorrow

                                lol honestly I would just execute then
