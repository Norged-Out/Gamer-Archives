[[Hello everyone, today I did a concept for a new lobby in dead by daylight D]]





This looks awesome, I love everything about it, the lighting, the scenery, the campfire, the trees and the moon in the back, my only gripe is that the camera position is a bit janky, I usually use a low FOV camera and place it a bit further away when doing this sort of artwork, the characters won't look as distorted and the scenery will look better too, the character distortion is most obvious with the trapper in your case
    next time I'll take that into account, thank you :)
        And you took constructive Criticism?????!!! How has behavior not hired you
            You answered your own question lol
            because they took constructive criticism
        I really like how you did it to be honest. Really amazing!
    I call to order the midnight society!  Sprinkles sparkly dust in the fire.
        What are you, afraid of the dark? Lol.
Why are you not employed at BHVR again ?
    Because Op has good ideas
        Someone hire this man
        And OP doesn't want to ruin the game with every update for sure.
        And if this doesn't ruin the actual gameplay, he wouldn't be hired
            Yeah, BHVR only hires morons, people who think you have to deny history, and people who think Teletubbies is the height of entertainment.

            Alright I know we're all being a little sarcastic and all but I think we should acknowledge that BHVR has a commendable work space climate and treats their employees much better than other companies.

We should not talk something that should be an industry standard down. Are they slow on updates? Yes. But that's because they don't purposely overwork everyone working there.

I know you probably don't meant to be mean just something that I think should be off limits.
                Don't get me wrong, BHVR was and kinda still is one of my favorite game studios. Most of my childhood games were from BHVR, and Fallout Shelter is just an amazing game. I just think they came a long bad way since the release of Dead by Daylight. I used to be addicted to the game, but since they started adding weird killers and nerfing things that actually needed some buffs, I just uninstalled it completely. I know they need money, so they added the battle pass thingy, but the rewards just don't seem worth the price and time wasted.
        Lmfao!!
        ooof
        r/unexpecteddiss
    I imagine they grab some random dude off the streets and employ them
        They might as well. That random dude could do more in a few hours than they did in a few months. Someone such as OP.
    Besides coming up with proof of concepts, what else can OP work on to help the company or the game?
        well, you're correct.
but at least they should start listening to actual good ideas from the playerbase.
    Thousandth upvote ! Seeing that 999 was irresistible
    Honestly, if everyone saw this being added it’d have the same feel as the ‘new’ hud. It looks like a mobile game
        can you explain please WHAT EXACTLY makes it MOBILE?????????????? I just wonder of all "mobile" compares...
            Especially since the mobile version of DBD has a way better HUD than the “main” game at this point.
    [deleted]
        It's a proof of concept dummy
    Look I think it looks good too, but lets not go full "NINTENDO HIRE THIS MAN"
    Because if it was from BHVR people would hate it.
This makes BHVR’s lobby look like shit.
    Because it is shit lol
        True, iirc the lobby hasn't been properly reworked since the game came out, just updated every now and then for things like events and new chapters. The lobby really is overdue for a visual update, and with all the map updates I think now's probably the time to do it.
            Honestly though there is so many things that need to be added before lobby changes since it took them forever just to add UI that no one wanted which way simpler.
            Also the field they run in at the end of matches. It’s a basic ground texture and nothing else
            I don't wanna be a downer. Lemme preface by saying I love this lobby, and almost every part of it... But if they did do it, we'd get "why'd they change lobby when literally no one asked for it".
                At least changing the lobby doesn’t intrude on the game like the HUD does. And speaking as a red ranked survivor, I spend more time in the lobby than I do in game these days. So I’d love something prettier to look at.
                    Yea me too. I like the new hud just cuz after 9000 hours any change to a stale game is great. Completely understand the hate for the new hud. But you can't deny people would complain about this when things like hacking exist
                I doubt it. Changing the lobby has no impact on the gameplay itself. Its practically just a loading screen.
                This gets into something that's sort of controversial. I think that the old veteran players don't really want the game to change too much because they really like the old version. I mean, most of the major complaints with 4.5.0 were the visual aspects like the animations and the HUD changes (excluding the jank hitboxes but that was a bug) and I noticed how most of the HUD propositions made by the community looked almost identical to the old one.

Not saying that the new HUD is better, I also preferred the old one and some of the community's propositions I would have like more, like using the adept achievements for portraits as it's more stylised, but it does seem like an odd coincidence.
                    I can name 5 veteran survivors that have the same opinion as me. Stale game needs change. Lol. Scott Jund makes content so sometimes you gotta take his opinion with a grain of Reddit. And the community HUDs were definitely 1000x better than what bhvr did. Theirs was terrible. But change was good.
            imagine if there was a set of free, earnable (rift, shards, etc), and paid lobby "skins" ppl can use instead of dealing with the same one for months on end
                I like that idea, being able to choose the lobby would add more customisation that could fill out rifts which is better than it all being charms and it would let people have 
more freedom
        remember when they had creepy looking shadow dummies in the lobby? Jesus they devs can be awful at design.
    BHVR: But this makes all the information easily accessible. We would rather opt for a more convoluted approach.
    I mean it kind of is. They put the bare minimum amount of effort into the lobby.
This is awesome! Implements the menu screen into the lobby.
Actually having survivors items above their head instead of “is that a key?” *hard squints*
    If you play ash you can hide it in his muppet
        Steve hides keys inside his own body
            ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
            Ah yes, smuggling keys across the border.
            They changed the pose btw. If he's carrying a key, he will now straighten the arm (like holding a medkit) and no longer ram it into his hip to smuggle it into the match.
    I always thought that was intentional. Like the match starts in the lobby and you’re supposed to be paying attention and spying on them if you wanna know what they have before the match begins.
        That would make sense... if BHVR did things intentionally
    Bill with his fucken holster, trying to hide the key behind it every damn time...
We should be able to customise our lobbies. You want the winter [theme](https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dead-by-daylight-winter.jpg?fit=1080%2C645&ssl=1) with the [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb7EhW6WLGY)? Go ahead! The Silent Hill [lobby](https://images.mein-mmo.de/medien/2020/05/Dead-by-Daylight-Pyramid-Head.jpg) with the Silent Hill [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr_AgjIbfx4)? Go ahead! Giving the lobby music to killers was a good step, but we should be able to apply any music whenever, with any background as well. I mean, they're already in the game, you'd just have to make a UI to select the one you want. Hell, if BHVR wanted to make money they could even sell custom ones in the store to justify the work
    I still can’t believe we can’t pick and choose which lobby music we want. The original Halloween music was a banger, hate that it didn’t come back during the hallowed blight and all that crap
        I've been wanting that menu to come back ever since. I really hope there's a chance in the future to use it again
    That Silent Hill one was great. Was such a shame it didn’t stick around longer.
Ever since I started playing I was wondering why they didn't utilize the campfire as a lobby for survivors, they even have various animations specifically for the characters at the campfire. 

Literally wasted opportunity.
This puts BHVR to shame, goddamn.
    Most community made stuff puts BHVR to shame
        All community made stuff puts BHVR to shame.
    BHVR doesn't need help looking shameful on their own honestly
And suddenly 30 bugs popped up. 

But seriously, I love this and think it would lool great.
    Yeah they would accidentally screw up legion’s power again
        Legion, ma poor poor boy ... or girl, I don’t care which you play as so long as you play the four teenagers who get winded after running for 15 seconds.
            Everyone dumps on Legion which makes me feel empowered when I win a match. Like ha you call Legion an M1 trash killer but you lost to them so what does that make you? :D
                I’d like to thank all the survivor mains who complained about ruin/undying. Because they gave me more fun with devour/undying. And my stabby bunny really enjoys devour/undying.
                    It's just annoying that BHVR introduced outfit sets. The only one I bought was Nea's, so I could glitch it when that glitch still existed. It was worth it as now I have an outfit more or less exclusive to me, though I haven't played in half a year or longer.
            arent they 5 now?
    >And suddenly 30 bugs popped up.

Only 30? They would need to postpone update twice to go so low.
        What can I say, I’m an optimist.
    Plague is now able to clip through stairs when walking and puking at the same time when wearing mixed cosmetics
YEEESSSS!! This looks so much better than awkward standing!
    Thematically ups the game by a lot, and it's so simple.
I love how the survivors have different sitting animations. I really like how Quentin is almost asleep.
    He falls asleep in the background of the main menu if he's there
    All the Survivors do already have unique animations when they're sitting by the fire on the main menu, and Quentin does indeed frequently have to wake himself up there.

Slow down mate. This is WAY too much work for behaviour, would take them at least 9 months for a working prototype. Do you really want them to crunch for such a complicated feature?
Yeah it’s a wonderful aesthetic. The games menu/lobby and end game screen all are long overdue for an update. 

I’d love to see you come up with a new post match idea besides the endless running.
    They should just put the people who were sacrificed on hooks or the people that were moried dead on the ground?
I think this is much better the one now is old and I want something new to see. Maybe they could have multiple lobby screens.
Looks perfect, the campfire sitting animations are so much more interesting than them just standing around
I would personally keep everyone slightly farther away or make the main scene smaller as everything looks really cramped together. I think that change would make this much nicer and something I'd want in the game.
I wish I had medals to give you

Edit: “PRO CAMPER” lmao
Ok,good concept.
But I think it's a LITTLE too much.
I dunno,screams overdone
    The camera fov. Just pull it back a little and it should be good
How many months of work did this take ?
    Not as long as it would with BHVR ;)
I wish that survivors would pop into lobbies with their own animation. Similar how smash bros characters arrive during the starting seconds of every match.

Some examples of the animations for survivor would be:

* Meg running from out of the entity smoke
* Smoke disperses and shows Jake successfully sabotaging a hook
* Claudette checking her med kit
* Dwight coming out of a locker
* Bill getting up on his after laying against a generator (similar to his Left Behind trailer)
* Quentin waking up
* Nea spray painting something
God it never ceases to amaze me just how much better the community is at dbd  then the dev team is
This is too good, BHVR will never use it
That's pretty cool. I have another idea you you're able to spin the camera around and you can see a silhouette of something in the distance through the fog
omg please
WE. NEED. THIS. YESTERDAY!
Man thats a pretty good job so far
I love this. Much more interesting than the current lobby.
I've always sort of wondered why this wasn't the thing anyway.
Missed opportunity for 69, 420 and 666, respectively. 2/10

Kidding. In actuality, this looks great. Would be a very welcome change that I’d ignore as xXgay_neaXx joins the lobby, then leaves, then comes back, then leaves again, as I’m waiting 15 minutes for a match to start and I’m tabbed-out to something else.
I always thought the campfire animations were a lot better than the standing ones. So much personality
Isn't this just Friday the 13th games lobby screen?
Bro this is single handily the best concept I’ve seen for this game and I’m mad the stupid devs haven’t came up with it yet
This is what they should have changed instead of the HUD in game.
If god existed this would be a thing
I am so sick of seeing my player hovering in the air before a match. This would be such a welcome change.
Hey this is amazing! Good job and thank you for sharing with us.
That’s actually pretty cool
This needs to be shown to the devs so they can do something like this. It looks really good.
This is amazing. We need this in the game.

Idk why but when I saw this all I could hear is Ash going "What now?" XD
When the community can make a better game than the devs
Looks great but could I borrow some of those iridescent shards?
So, are the survivors blind?

Or is the trapper a master of camouflage?
"69 auric cells"

Nice.
Nancy, the Big Friendly Giant.

This is awesome btw.
I bet it took you months of work, right?
    no, it took me 3 days. Working in SFM is much easier than just drawing everything from scratch
        It was a little joke on how the person behind the new HUD claimed it was months of work. Still great stuff, dude, very well made!
I know that this is just ur concept and ur own opinion but after reading the comments.. this is just asking for too much.. They cannot do every little things the community wants..
This is Amazing!
That is amazing
Quentin with Pharmacy
Insane, makes it look much scarier but they just need to change the idle stance for survivors then the game would be perfecto
Hey this is amazing! Good job and thank you for sharing with us
that is awesome, so much more personal  :)
This looks so good! Also the funny details of 69 Auric Cells, a Laurie with a Key calls "Toxic Survivor," the Trapper's name being "PRO\_CAMPER666"
Got my vote, sucks Matt and BHVR are more into shitty cosmetics and crappy QoL changes instead of giving us what we actually want in QoL.
Don’t let BHVR see your creation. They will hard block it never use it.
I actually thought this was a leak from the upcoming update that they're currently teasing, it's such amazing work. Wow!

An idea to add to yours would be that once the timer hits 5 seconds and the choices are locked in, from the killers perspective he/she starts to move in on the survivors and from the survivors perspective/perspective of the campfire scene the killers heartbeat is heard and the survivors disperse.

I know that not all killers have the heartbeat sound when within their terror radius (e.g. Tier 1 Myers), but this sound would be generic so that you couldn't assume who the killer was beforehand.
it looks like the guy made a dark joke to Nancy and she bit is head off. and everyone is just in awkward silence

looks better than the regular one btw
Yes because then their animations for the campfire could be seen better!
please get hired 😭
69 rewards... I fear I cannot touch this, but please accept my humble upvote. I love this concept!
The Survivor campfire animations are so cool yet so hard to actually notice
so the lobby screen for zombies in BO3 yea?
Member of community comes up with a great idea....  


BEhaviour:  HUD go Brrrr
Maybe make it farther from the screen. I feel like I'm being interrogated by nancy
I can see the frame rate issues in the picture
This reminds me of Nickelodeon's "Are you afraid of the dark?"
That is a lot of Iridescent Shards
You need to work on your FOV.
I would physically pay real money for this
i would genuinely pay to have this lobby. i absolutely love it and it has such a next gen gaming feel to it. it's not like it's a top priority in the game with all the issues it has to change the lobby, but it is certainly in need of a rework and this looks amazing.
Great work, that looks a lot more better then the actual lobby with those cheap smoke place holder. Only thing I don’t agree with, is that the killer see what item you are bringing into the game. After all, you don’t see the killer either. Just my opinion 🙃
What if you wanted to turn them around eg putting on cosmetics
    They could make it to where you go to the customization tab, and it’ll have the character separated from everyone else. So like how you can zoom in on charms
        Sounds like a good idea
I really like it, but I lf BHVR did this 90% of the community would complain "WHY ARE YOU MAKING NEW LOBBY SCREENS? THE OTHER ONE WAS FINE!!!!! FIX BUGS!!!!1!1
This is a neat concept, but these are my criticisms:

- the survivor perspective is a little cheesy(?), maybe pull the camera back, slightly closer than the main menu
- the item over the head looks a little clunky but it’s a good idea and there are probably other ways to implement it
- with the sitting animation it would be hard to test cosmetic combinations or rotate your characters to see their back
My bad I didn't see that there is two pictures
Cool idea , but BHVRonly care about adding new skins
I'd love
U just made the game so much better, but it's a good idea and it's against what Devs want.they didn't even want to admit how the new HUD was terrible till they updated it
Wheres the killer

Ignore me. Thats amazing
    There’s a second picture with the killer
        yeah i know i edited it right after saying ignore me, i found it.
Must of taken months of hard work
Yes yes yes yes yes this x100!!! I’ve always thought the lobby was very... *bland* and I think having it tied to the lore of them by the campfire really adds the immersion, not only having them sitting by the fire in the main menu
The cherry on top would be an indication of which people are on a swf team/pair.

It would help me be choosy as both survivor and killer (I don’t want to be a part of either. Random or die)
Ah yes thicc nancy.
As much as I love this, it’s so much easier to put on stylish Jane Romero cosmetics while she’s standing. It’s easier to see her ass.
Meh.
Ewwwww 🤢
    - u/JeffNorth119’s mother after birth
        Cool
Cool and all, but I don’t think the lobby is the biggest issue rn
Aren't they technically summoned into the playing grounds and not just waiting like "guess it's my turn guys see you in a bit" it would be better for end game screen maybe even an animation if you wait til all the survivors either escape or die they meet there.
Please don't kill my frame rates, the game is shit optimized as it is so don't give'em ideas.
This is my 2nd comment but real tawk how does this have less upvotes than me taking a screenshot of the new demo skin and saying cum
    Because this is actually good and not cringey
        Now it has more and I am so glad my post about cumogorgon is stupid as shit
This looks amazing!! I'd love to have this.
Awesome! This is something people would like so obviously this won't get done, but we'll get a a whole new UI that looks like trash.
Quentin baby lookin tired and depressed as always 😔👍
PRO_CAMPER666
I like this a lot
Its pretty good
This looks so cool, I love it!
BHVR give this man a job immediately
This is so awesome. I love how it oozes the creepy slasher atmosphere.
God I wish this was real
I actually really like this
This looks amazing!!
Kinda reminds me of Secret Neighbor, looks great!
Love it. The bitch would be the animations, unless they’re all generic.
Omg this would be so cool. You’ve got great ideas!
If i could just gather these internet talent and start dbd from scratch in few months the new game will be soooooooooo much better than the stock dbd. Plz some good company take note.
I like it, good job!
I never understood why they think it's ok that some of the items are "hidden" behind the survivor models. You can 100% miss keys or even flashlights on some survivors because of their stances.
Why does Nancy look so passed off?
Looks amazing imo, only critique is maybe making the survivors’ usernames/items/location not as far cause I’m a blind boi
Really good, would be awesome to see this in the game.
Reminds me of the black ops 3 zombies lobby screen.
thats freaking awesome i love the little details like the outlines for the items   nice job XD
This is amazing!! OMG 😳
YES! So much yes!
Amazing!
Should take a few years
I have ALWAYS said there should be a generic icon showing what item they have bc sometimes you just can’t fucking see it. Also having it next to their name in the in-game pause menu would be nice too, in case you were afk for the entire lobby process
Me like.
Wow, this looks great!
10 times better than the actual ones
Honestly I just want to have the Legion or Silent Hill themed lobbies again. These looks great though!
to be honest i only liked the survivor one, but its damn nice!
That looks great!  
I first thought the survivors should be closer so you can see the items they're bringing but nope, you thought of that and solved it really well!
I love this
i like this but isn’t this exactly what the jason game has
Also who plays Quentin anymore...
I want it now
Is this sfm or something else?
    Yea
        Good job it looks great!
BHVR take notes please
I don’t even play DBD and this looks awesome
God damn you’re good
I need this.
This dude coud took over half of desine BHVR studio with 5% of his power.
You shoud apply for a job OP.
Isn’t this almost like the old lobby?
That is awesome
I wish it was the actual screen
i hope we can get something like this after they are done with the maps.
The only thing i don't like is that it's a bit hard for the killer to see the items. Otherwise, this looks fantastic!
That looks so cool holly fak devs need to take some notes.
Keep up the good work :-)
this looks insane
YES, THIS
This looks amazing man, let's hope behavior take some notes cause the lobby definitely needs an overhaul.
Their facial expression disturbs me
Yes, this is what we wanted all along!
Incredible!!
This is sick dude, well done!!
[removed]
    It's the second photo in the album
        [removed]
            Lol it happens. Sometimes it seems like the indicator doesn't show up to let you know there's more than one photo
Knowing behavior they would claim this change would take 3 years
I love this, I can picture the animation of the camera closing in on them from the main screen.
Honestly this would be amazing to tell the difference between the keys.
Get this man all the possible awards on Reddit and hire him in BHVR
Yeah this is fucking great
Shit I thought this was a new update or something, it looks so real! Amazing job, 10/10
would be so much nicer wow
Man this could be awesome and for killer they could have unique poses while looking at survivors in the woods. Maybe legion is squatting on a trunk or demo crawls out of a portal and waits on all 4s hell maybe have ghostface lean out from behind a tree.
SO COOL!!!!
From the killer pov it's really hard to tell what items are being used. The menu already needs an update where the killer can see the rarity of items as is. But this still looks good. The survivors can have a lot more personality in the way they sit or maybe stand
This actually sparked some ideas of mine. 

So when someone joins a lobby, I think the characters should walk over to the campfire and sit down. 

When the game starts, if there's any offerings in play, we get a top view close-up of the campfire where we see the offerings drop inside it and burn

When characters are loading into the map, they could sort of materialize onto the terrain with some cool Entity flame/smoke effects.

Wonderfully done concept!
This is awesome. The lobby needs an update. Also- why can’t we get some loading screens in the rift?
I love how random redditors always have better design and concepts than BVHR.

And then BVHR still manages to just fuck the game up more.
The problem is that Blight wouldnt be able to look over that log
Very Jason voorhees. Love it.
Impressive,  most impressive.
Fucking fire. I love it. And you
It kinda looks like the killer wants to sit by the fire too.
Ohh this is nice and very monotizable(which execs love). They can sell different loading themes and such.
This would be really cool if this was the lobby screen
Imagine the survivors walking into frame and sitting down as they enter the lobby. If they leave the lobby their character stands up and walks away.
this is the dbd2 i want and need
SUPER SICK! 💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
To bad bhvr hates good creators
Why couldn't they do that to begin with?? This is 10000x better than now hire this man
This is a beautiful concept. Really good job! It would be cool if a survivor was joining your lobby they walked in from the woods and sat down on the log and then leaving the lobby they would just get up then disappear back into the woods.
This looks amazing. The lobby really needs to be changed.
Wow that looks really good ! It really cozy =)
AWESOME WORK! Would love to see this happen
This looks super cool!
Amazing!!
Perfect! So they don’t have to stand for 10 minutes while they queue at night...
    They're just standing there...MENACINGLY!
I would like this SO MUCH MORE
Why aren’t you employed at BHVR?
Why aren’t you employed at BHVR?
This is absolutely perfect and one of the most, if not the most needed non-gameplay change. It looks great, good job.
I would love a lobby where my shitty little eyes could actually make out the key
69 lauric cells? Cheeky.
"toxic survival" hahahaaa
OP please get a good programing job and do this. Make your own DBD if you have to because this is dope af
can we get you hired please?
Ok now this is fire
Very well made lobby, hope they make it!
This is honestly a great idea
I'm imagining the killer is lounging in a lawnchair outside of the firelight lol
he really needed to put that 69
Holy... wow this is incredible
Woah, this is dope! If it were for me I'd make it so that the camera is a bit farther away from Nancy, but this is awesome, I'd really love to see it ingame at some point.
Already looks better than the real deal
the survivor's items above their heads!! bhvr pls hire this person
I can already hear the fans ramping up.
So much better
Really loved the concept. Incredible.
Sick
69 aurelic cells? Hell yeah
Trapper kinda looks like TDKR Bane in that second pic.
Once again the community comes up with something none of us asked for, but would be a welcome addition to the game. Instead of like the developers where they add a change that nobody wants and everyone hates. I’m honestly amazed by this.
This is amazing!!
VERY cool!
i never comment post but holy shit this is one is so good. i love the little icons of the item they have !
I like it
Nintendo hire this man!
omg meg doesnt look evil
This is what i’ve been talking about but no one really cared when I commented! great work and this is what I imagine the loading screen should look like
Nice auric cells you got there
That’s amazing OP!!!
This is fire. I always wished they would actually sit around the campfire when waiting for a lobby.
Now this is awesome, but not just awesome, I mean, this is, no joke, the best concept or art I saw in this game
Love it, it looks incredible
Wow!!! This is crazy cool.
I want this in the game
I love how many auric cells you have hehehe
They should actually use this, great work!
I’m surprised this wasn’t a thing to begin with. Looks amazing and should definitely be a part of the game
much better
Yeah seeing survivor just standing in there is weird! this much better and make sense!
That’s would be so cool!!!
Man wish there was a third pic of the killer rotated to the camera being like aww yah im going to kill them all
I love everything about it. It would probably break the game ( even more ) if they tried the change the lobby layout. This looks more legit than what we currently have.
Yes to the million auric cells and bloodpoints. I approve of this concept.
And a killer in the shadows in the trees behind them would make it perfect.
Very sick.
Pretty good job so far
This, this is the kind of changes we need.
This would actually be sick. Have the newest people joining the lobby (if everybody doesn’t pop in at once) walk to their seat and sit down
Love it
Ooo, this is a brilliant idea! ✨
Holy crap I want this!
TBH this would at least help me see if certain survivors are holding items. Steve is sneaky when he has something like a key in his hand.
i love this!!!
Looks damn cool
this is a cool lobby but as a joke this looks like one of those dbd mobile spinoffs you find in the play store😂
That would be sooooo much cooler
This reminds me of cod zombies
It reminds me of Friday the 13th game and movies
I might play again if they do this
Awesome
Me like a lot
This is the thing they BHVR should be dedicating “ months of work “ too not shit ass worthless ugly UIs
... Actually I was really curious why this wasn't already a thing. They should be sittin gat the campfire. It makes sense. We already have them sitting at the campfire in the background right now.
This is MUCH better than characters awkwardly standing and looking around, this adds much more life in the waiting lobby.
I mean please yes! It looks so much better than standing around
yes
there is now way it can get better than this
Giganancy
Love this idea! I've been wanting this for months! I know this is only a concept (sad) but something about it looks a lil off with the camera
I mean it‘s awesome but if they decide to change something that „big“ in the lobby the community would most likely start crying again since they „waste“ their time...
The Trapper looks so cringe in that corner lmaooo

Great art, altough I prefer the current lobbies.
This looks sooooo good.
Good. Very nice
This is awesome. BHVR please hire
I love this
Seeing this makes me wonder why it's not in the game already. Behavior is slacking lol
When will they update how lobbys look and when are exit gates getting a touch up tf
This looks so awesome. It would be cool if killer had a view of them in the dark of the forest between trees stalking them
Very cool concept, love it. Only... am I going crazy or did you put the numbers in front of the currency icons? It hasn’t always been like that, has it!? Lol am I losing it?
That's actually really cool I like that
This is awesome, but I agreed with the other, the camera is too close to the person. Why BHVR doesn't recruit you again?
That’s pretty fucking cool. I’d like to see some more detail in the lobbies tbh. Or a more immersive look.
It reminds me of one of the BO Zombies loading screens. Looks super cool too
If you make everyone the same size it would look better seriously Nancy looks like a giant
    This is a perspective effect, I assure you that they are all the same size, you can see this if you open the second picture.
        Yes I know that, but it doesn’t look right, it looks really off Nancy looks like a giant compared to the others even if it is perspective effect I don’t like this part. Other than that I think everything else looks very good, good work.
Did it take you 3 months and is not reversible?
Anyway, this looks fantastic
but then survivors would complain about keys being more noticeable
As nice as that it i feel like at the end of the day there are other things to focus on that are more important.  Like that Papa Trapper TLC
Nice
The lobby now is so bland, this is so much better
This would be incredible. This IS incredible !
How does a random player gets such good ideas for the gane he plays and the devs not ?
Nice thing,maybe a petition for this to be in the game,it will be lovely.
Lol does it include not ready ones getting out of the lobby at start so it becomes a 3 vs one or 2 vs 1 xD
new lobby in next chapter :O?
Nice auric cells
This looks so fucking amazing!
As long as it includes all the currencies too then I'm down
The survivors could be in their menu stances, just the thought of that is epic.
This is amazing
man i miss the old warm lighting.
I hope they do this!!!
Congratulations, you’ve done more for the game than the actual dev team has in the past 2 years
Love it.
Damn! That looks amazing! I know you've already gotten a lot of praise, but yeah, incredible!
Holy fuck this is so awesome
This is great! I really like it. With new polished graphics and such, this would be awesome.
I wish this was the lobby screen
If you’re the killer, you should be appear in the bushes without being seen
Sorry I forgot if I already commented on this piece, but just wanted to share my enthusiasm of it!

It looks very lovely, and I believe that it could add so much more flair and personality to both the Survivors and Killers.

You could have Quentin sleeping and trying to stay awake, meg being jittery and holding or having an empty can of energy drink next to her, bill...being bill, ya know!

Killers I bet would have a list of things also, from Pig tampering with her traps, to The Nightmare gawking and flinging his hand around with soul trapped victims inside, to Trapper holding onto one of his traps and preparing to set it up to practice.

So many damn good options! Thanks for making this, and putting so much effort into it.
It looks cool but I’d say it has more Friday the 13th vibes
So basically IDV lobby
400th comment
    :0
YES PLEASE, NICE THATS REALLY COOL IDEA
69 Auric Cells.  Nice.
Just need to see killer's pov but looks really good !
    open the second picture
        Right didnt see thanks xD
at first glance, when i was scrolling past this on my feed, i thought nancy was just like 3 times as big as everyone else LMAO. But when i actually clicked into the image i could see what was going on. this is amazing!! id love of bhvr did something like this. looks great!
From afar it looks like Quentin is having a panic attack
next time I'll take that into account, thank you :)
    And you took constructive Criticism?????!!! How has behavior not hired you
        You answered your own question lol
        because they took constructive criticism
    I really like how you did it to be honest. Really amazing!
I call to order the midnight society!  Sprinkles sparkly dust in the fire.
    What are you, afraid of the dark? Lol.
Because Op has good ideas
    Someone hire this man
    And OP doesn't want to ruin the game with every update for sure.
    And if this doesn't ruin the actual gameplay, he wouldn't be hired
        Yeah, BHVR only hires morons, people who think you have to deny history, and people who think Teletubbies is the height of entertainment.

        Alright I know we're all being a little sarcastic and all but I think we should acknowledge that BHVR has a commendable work space climate and treats their employees much better than other companies.

We should not talk something that should be an industry standard down. Are they slow on updates? Yes. But that's because they don't purposely overwork everyone working there.

I know you probably don't meant to be mean just something that I think should be off limits.
            Don't get me wrong, BHVR was and kinda still is one of my favorite game studios. Most of my childhood games were from BHVR, and Fallout Shelter is just an amazing game. I just think they came a long bad way since the release of Dead by Daylight. I used to be addicted to the game, but since they started adding weird killers and nerfing things that actually needed some buffs, I just uninstalled it completely. I know they need money, so they added the battle pass thingy, but the rewards just don't seem worth the price and time wasted.
    Lmfao!!
    ooof
    r/unexpecteddiss
I imagine they grab some random dude off the streets and employ them
    They might as well. That random dude could do more in a few hours than they did in a few months. Someone such as OP.
Besides coming up with proof of concepts, what else can OP work on to help the company or the game?
    well, you're correct.
but at least they should start listening to actual good ideas from the playerbase.
Thousandth upvote ! Seeing that 999 was irresistible
Honestly, if everyone saw this being added it’d have the same feel as the ‘new’ hud. It looks like a mobile game
    can you explain please WHAT EXACTLY makes it MOBILE?????????????? I just wonder of all "mobile" compares...
        Especially since the mobile version of DBD has a way better HUD than the “main” game at this point.
[deleted]
    It's a proof of concept dummy
Look I think it looks good too, but lets not go full "NINTENDO HIRE THIS MAN"
Because if it was from BHVR people would hate it.
Because it is shit lol
    True, iirc the lobby hasn't been properly reworked since the game came out, just updated every now and then for things like events and new chapters. The lobby really is overdue for a visual update, and with all the map updates I think now's probably the time to do it.
        Honestly though there is so many things that need to be added before lobby changes since it took them forever just to add UI that no one wanted which way simpler.
        Also the field they run in at the end of matches. It’s a basic ground texture and nothing else
        I don't wanna be a downer. Lemme preface by saying I love this lobby, and almost every part of it... But if they did do it, we'd get "why'd they change lobby when literally no one asked for it".
            At least changing the lobby doesn’t intrude on the game like the HUD does. And speaking as a red ranked survivor, I spend more time in the lobby than I do in game these days. So I’d love something prettier to look at.
                Yea me too. I like the new hud just cuz after 9000 hours any change to a stale game is great. Completely understand the hate for the new hud. But you can't deny people would complain about this when things like hacking exist
            I doubt it. Changing the lobby has no impact on the gameplay itself. Its practically just a loading screen.
            This gets into something that's sort of controversial. I think that the old veteran players don't really want the game to change too much because they really like the old version. I mean, most of the major complaints with 4.5.0 were the visual aspects like the animations and the HUD changes (excluding the jank hitboxes but that was a bug) and I noticed how most of the HUD propositions made by the community looked almost identical to the old one.

Not saying that the new HUD is better, I also preferred the old one and some of the community's propositions I would have like more, like using the adept achievements for portraits as it's more stylised, but it does seem like an odd coincidence.
                I can name 5 veteran survivors that have the same opinion as me. Stale game needs change. Lol. Scott Jund makes content so sometimes you gotta take his opinion with a grain of Reddit. And the community HUDs were definitely 1000x better than what bhvr did. Theirs was terrible. But change was good.
        imagine if there was a set of free, earnable (rift, shards, etc), and paid lobby "skins" ppl can use instead of dealing with the same one for months on end
            I like that idea, being able to choose the lobby would add more customisation that could fill out rifts which is better than it all being charms and it would let people have 
more freedom
    remember when they had creepy looking shadow dummies in the lobby? Jesus they devs can be awful at design.
BHVR: But this makes all the information easily accessible. We would rather opt for a more convoluted approach.
I mean it kind of is. They put the bare minimum amount of effort into the lobby.
If you play ash you can hide it in his muppet
    Steve hides keys inside his own body
        ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
        Ah yes, smuggling keys across the border.
        They changed the pose btw. If he's carrying a key, he will now straighten the arm (like holding a medkit) and no longer ram it into his hip to smuggle it into the match.
I always thought that was intentional. Like the match starts in the lobby and you’re supposed to be paying attention and spying on them if you wanna know what they have before the match begins.
    That would make sense... if BHVR did things intentionally
Bill with his fucken holster, trying to hide the key behind it every damn time...
I still can’t believe we can’t pick and choose which lobby music we want. The original Halloween music was a banger, hate that it didn’t come back during the hallowed blight and all that crap
    I've been wanting that menu to come back ever since. I really hope there's a chance in the future to use it again
That Silent Hill one was great. Was such a shame it didn’t stick around longer.
Most community made stuff puts BHVR to shame
    All community made stuff puts BHVR to shame.
BHVR doesn't need help looking shameful on their own honestly
Yeah they would accidentally screw up legion’s power again
    Legion, ma poor poor boy ... or girl, I don’t care which you play as so long as you play the four teenagers who get winded after running for 15 seconds.
        Everyone dumps on Legion which makes me feel empowered when I win a match. Like ha you call Legion an M1 trash killer but you lost to them so what does that make you? :D
            I’d like to thank all the survivor mains who complained about ruin/undying. Because they gave me more fun with devour/undying. And my stabby bunny really enjoys devour/undying.
                It's just annoying that BHVR introduced outfit sets. The only one I bought was Nea's, so I could glitch it when that glitch still existed. It was worth it as now I have an outfit more or less exclusive to me, though I haven't played in half a year or longer.
        arent they 5 now?
>And suddenly 30 bugs popped up.

Only 30? They would need to postpone update twice to go so low.
    What can I say, I’m an optimist.
Plague is now able to clip through stairs when walking and puking at the same time when wearing mixed cosmetics
Thematically ups the game by a lot, and it's so simple.
He falls asleep in the background of the main menu if he's there
All the Survivors do already have unique animations when they're sitting by the fire on the main menu, and Quentin does indeed frequently have to wake himself up there.

They should just put the people who were sacrificed on hooks or the people that were moried dead on the ground?
The camera fov. Just pull it back a little and it should be good
Not as long as it would with BHVR ;)
no, it took me 3 days. Working in SFM is much easier than just drawing everything from scratch
    It was a little joke on how the person behind the new HUD claimed it was months of work. Still great stuff, dude, very well made!
They could make it to where you go to the customization tab, and it’ll have the character separated from everyone else. So like how you can zoom in on charms
    Sounds like a good idea
There’s a second picture with the killer
    yeah i know i edited it right after saying ignore me, i found it.
- u/JeffNorth119’s mother after birth
    Cool
Because this is actually good and not cringey
    Now it has more and I am so glad my post about cumogorgon is stupid as shit
Yea
    Good job it looks great!
It's the second photo in the album
    [removed]
        Lol it happens. Sometimes it seems like the indicator doesn't show up to let you know there's more than one photo
They're just standing there...MENACINGLY!
This is a perspective effect, I assure you that they are all the same size, you can see this if you open the second picture.
    Yes I know that, but it doesn’t look right, it looks really off Nancy looks like a giant compared to the others even if it is perspective effect I don’t like this part. Other than that I think everything else looks very good, good work.

open the second picture
    Right didnt see thanks xD
