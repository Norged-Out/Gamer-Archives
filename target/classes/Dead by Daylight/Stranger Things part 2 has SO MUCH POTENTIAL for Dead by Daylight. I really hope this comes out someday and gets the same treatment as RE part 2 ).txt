[[Stranger Things part 2 has SO MUCH POTENTIAL for Dead by Daylight. I really hope this comes out someday and gets the same treatment as RE part 2 )]]





I‚Äôd literally pay an arm and a kidney for this to be real. I so badly want more stranger things skins.
Only started watching stranger things this month just got to season 4 episode 1 so I can now give my opinion on this subject 

I now hate how all the fan chapters said Eddie should be the survivor and not the worlds greatest dad Jim FUCKING Hopper he is a way better fit
    The adults in stranger things are underrated. My pick for the survivors would be Jim Hopper and Joyce Byers
        Someone came up with a cool Joyce concept a while back. Had an exhaustion perk that triggered upon blinding. Would be a ridiculous combo with champion of light.
            Hm but the only time you can realistically and guarantee a blind is when you pallet stun them and that‚Äôs if they don‚Äôt have light borne . And then there‚Äôs already a perk that allows you run fast after a pallet stun . 

Maybe if she had a perk that has a stronger blind that can still blind even if the killer looks away, except from behind, though drawback is it kills the battery quicker and the perk is turned off work when a survivor is being carried, so I guess it‚Äôs good while in chase
    I‚Äôve never had a desire to P100 a survivor, that would change immediately if Hopper got added
    i only want jim hopper because i wanna drool over my pc while playing (he is hot)
    Literally what I think every time, I see this subject. Same with Joyce
        Same. Hopper would almost certainly be the survivor... they'd re-use the dad bod rig they have for jeff and jonah

He has lots of cosmetic options too... the deputy fit would probably be his default, but he could have some fun ones too like hawaiian shirt or russian soldier cosmetics

Eddie is definitely more legendary skin material imo - in the hellfire club shirt of course
    World‚Äôs Greatest dad, hmmm. Crane Dad has something to say about that
Hopper as a survivor fits so perfectly
Fuck. Yes. All of the yes.
Steve Harrington scoops ahoy is best skin, but topless Steve Harrington in the upside down? Im listening‚Ä¶
    Who would become more popular¬†


Shirtless David vs Shirtless Steve
So mad they never gave us Star Court
    The neon would fit well with Trickster.
        So mad they didn't give us neon downtown Korean city as a map when Trickster came out. The lobby was teasing us.
            For real
Yes. Yes. Yes. YESSSSSSS

Having Vecna as a killer and not featuring, Max Mayfield as a legendary skin, who actually ran away and survived is like, idk, waaay too fitting for this game not to be included!
    I don't think she's 18 in the show and DBD doesn't want to put minors in
        Nancy is 15-16 and Steve Harrington is 16-17 in Season 1, which their base outfits are based on and Heather Mason is 17

The game has three minor survivors
            Is it possible they allow it for DLCs but are worried about coming under fire themselves if they do it for an original character?¬†
                Yeah, maybe? I mean, I can't say anything on it, but we do have canon minors as playable characters. But for the original characters, I think the youngest is collage students. I guess licensed characters will just be said they were aged up anyways, Most of them are not far off from 18 anyways like Cheryl and Laurie, who were 17.
i need an eddie skin and a jeff hellfire club skin so fucking bad
Remember the fake Stranger Things map leak?
    Yes, but DBDleaks said it was true but I don't know
        Still holding on to hope? ST has already come back and it‚Äôs been months
            No I know lol I was just referring to the Rework on the Hawkins Lab map
        Let's be real, even if the map was in fact datamined like they claim it was, it's pretty obvious that it was never meant to be added to the game itself.
    The Rainbow Room leak wasn‚Äôt fake. However, the way they described it, the assets weren‚Äôt all put together - someone from the leak community constructed the map the video was shot on from scraps of map textures in the game files.

It‚Äôs very possible that Netflix was negotiating more content for DbD and made a quick turn-around, after all, we lost the license very soon after receiving new skins if my memory doesn‚Äôt fail me.

Not to mention, we got those map leaks around 3-4 months before the Stranger Things DLC was reactivated so reactivation was likely already on the development timeline, and they put old assets back into the game ready, including the remnants of the map.
I don‚Äôt own Steve or Nancy, I got Demo using auric cells, I just don‚Äôt play survivor enough to justify purchasing either of them, if this came out I would purchase the chapter instantly
Gotta be Scoops Ahoy Robin.
I need Eddie as a survivor.
Yes please. I'd be down for this.
Need this for Robin alone
I'd love Joyce and Jim! Especially Joyce if she's made to look like Winona. I love her. :>
This is one of the best concepts I‚Äôve ever seen. They should hire you.¬†
You may be getting your wish with vecna just not the stranger things version
    Either Vecna is wanted!!! I‚Äôd be fine with the original dungeons and dragons version, or the stranger things one. I just want him! üò©
I'd love Vecna as a killer and now that we have Stranger Things back it could really happen.
I want mall monster as a killer
Me hearing, seeing and reading anything Eddie related:

If they do a survivor, Eddie would be the best fit.¬† I was hoping for a Barb, but Robin would be cool too.
Eddie Munson gimme
I'm pretty sure a new Stranger Things chapter is a given. But I'm guessing they are waiting until the release of Season 5 to have Eleven as a Survivor considering they were minors in S4. As for the other Survivor it will most likely be Max or Jim. 

Also IF BHVR really wanted to make a cool map they could do another map that's completely in-doors and use Henry Creel's house both in the real world and in the upside down. The Mall would be the second best option in my opinion.
    Waiting for Eleven‚Äôs age doesn‚Äôt make sense, because remember Yoichi from Ringu in the game, he is specially aged for the game.
        Which proves my point. They re-envisioned the character as an adult because they can't introduce a minor.  In case of Stranger Things they can easily wait because releasing a Stranger Things Part 2 chapter when season 5 releases is more hype and all the characters are adults at that point. Therefore they don't have to re-envision the characters older for the sake if releasing the chapter sooner.
Where's Billy?
I want stranger things 2 as an excuse for them to rework the dogshit that is hawkins I fucking hate that map so much
Jim.... :'(
All of this is perfect that's why it won't happen lol
Haha would love to play in that mall
okay but lowkey Hopper and Joyce are SUCH crazy good survivor ideas
Wouldn't the red hellscape dimension that Vecna lives in (the one where he took Max to kill her) make more sense as the new map than the mall?
Depending on how much Netflix needs cash, I could see this happening üòπ
I can just imagine his mori being how he kills in Stranger things. Honestly would be great

Eddie must be a stand alone character, not a skin for Steve. Other than that you nailed everything perfectly!!! I really want chad russian prison Hopper skin and demo!
I‚Äôd rather Mind flayed , design wise both are very cool but lore wise I don‚Äôt like Vecna
i‚Äôd pay big bucks for eddie to never come to the game
I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre doing dnd  Vecna instead personally so that we don‚Äôt get a ST pt2.
    ‚ÄúTries to be different‚Äù alright.
We don‚Äôt need vecna from stranger things, we need Vecna from D&D, much more terrifying
with same treatment you mean a p2w killer with high mobility, easy to use power with a large hitbox, basekit slowdown as well as basekit info (aura or  killerinstinct)?

yeah thats what we need. I think they should add passive injury, broken effect, undetectable and passive  mangled + deep wound (hello SM).

    Bro‚Äôs new in the game I suppose
        Why do you think so?

He has lots of cosmetic options too... the deputy fit would probably be his default, but he could have some fun ones too like hawaiian shirt or russian soldier cosmetics

Eddie is definitely more legendary skin material imo - in the hellfire club shirt of course

The neon would fit well with Trickster.
    So mad they didn't give us neon downtown Korean city as a map when Trickster came out. The lobby was teasing us.
