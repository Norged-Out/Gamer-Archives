[[The Arkham Asylum bios had some of the best character designs ever. it's a real shame that they were never used outside of the game]]





I always took it as what they look like when they're not in their Arkham attirement. Except Joker and Harley obviously since the former just arrived and the latter wasn't imprisoned.

Also in Batman's case it's basically the game's suit but more stylized. The length of the ears and the shape of the Bat-symbol are the only major differences.
    Batman looks like a five year old about to cry because he‚Äôs not allowed ice cream
Make sure to check out the Paul Dini Arkham City prequel comics, they also feature Carlos D'Anda on art.
    The art is amazing. Mine has a spread at the end with and without coloring and is super interesting to see how it changes.
    I knew I recognized the artstyle in those comics somewhere
The Croc design is always the first one to come to mind when I think of Croc
Bro all I want is a Batman game in a style like this.
    Have you ever played this small, little known game called ‚ÄúBatman: Arkham Asylum‚Äù?
        Oh, is that the one from 2009, with like 4 villains altogether, none of which look remotely similar to how they did in the bios? 

No, haven‚Äôt played that one. Gonna try it out one day though.
Tbf in Origins Firefly‚Äôs design looked pretty stellar. But yeah, Knight really dropped the ball. 

Oh and obligatory r/Killermothgang RISE UP
    Not saying Knight‚Äôs Firefly design wasn‚Äôt bad, but as a feeble defense, most side villains in Knight looked pretty worn out and disheveled (e.g. Penguin, Riddler, Ra‚Äôs, Croc) when compared to what they looked like in previous games, so I can at least appreciate that they were trying to do the same thing with Firefly, especially considering he was absent for the last two games chronologically and was only hitting these buildings as part of a deal to help the firefighters.
Should‚Äôve been another game in Arkham asylum game with all the villains in the bios that we never faced.
    And it would a psychedelic trip through the Asylum like in Serious House on Serious Earths
Would've killed to see characters like Azrael, Red Hood, Pyg and Man-bat in this style.
I want a Batman game in this art style
    I‚Äôm really hoping Gotham Knight‚Äôs designs will go full cartoony and exaggerated. No matter how bad the gameplay might look, I‚Äôm excited for the game purely due to the artstyle.
Don‚Äôt forget the Calender Man suit

That suit was a BANGER bro

The reason why people don‚Äôt like him is because elf the goofy cape but that suit is AWESOME
'Sup guys, Waylon from [moreplatesmoredates.com](https://moreplatesmoredates.com), today we're talking about monster delts workout!
    Yeah I‚Äôm natty I just eat 800g of protein from human meat per day and take cold baths in the sewers.
        Fucking supraphysiological, dude.
    His deltoid muscles shown here are to me synonymous with Arkhamverse Croc.
Just realize how close firefly and croc look to their origins design
Croc looks bad but the others are crazy cool looking. I can‚Äôt tell which firefly design I like more. The gray one or the yellow and black one.
Here we go again..
Zsasz just wants to be spanked.
Why I thought it was Jak first
üôå this is what I‚Äôve been saying
Does anyone know the name of the artist?
They used these designs in the Road to Arkham comic!
