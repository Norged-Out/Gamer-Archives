[[Arkham Asylum - a game that aged like a fine wine]]


I bought Arkham Asylum on steam during the summer of 2020 as a huge batch of games to entertain myself with during quarantine, and it never really caught on all that well at first. I gave up not too far after an hour or so in game, and didn't touch it for another year. Recently however, I decided to give it another shot, and good god am I glad I did.

You'll most likely have heard of that joke that Spiderman on PS4 makes you feel like Spiderman. Well, what that game did to Spidey, this game does to Bats. 

The combat is smooth and flows like water, making you feel like a martial arts expert and a detective who can think on the spot and use the enemy's movements to his advantage. The use of detective mode to show you the biggest things such as breakable walls and hard-to-reach vents, as well as the small details such as an NPCs heartbeat and mental state (I loved that btw, it was such a small detail but it was hella immersive) was so well done. Mark Hamill's phenomenal performance as the Joker kept a smile on my face. The way the environment subtly hints at you where to go next and what path might be accessible without ever being too handhold-y was brilliant too. The atmosphere was spot on, grimy and murky and dark, and I felt dirty just looking at some of the visuals. The characters all look amazing as well, particularly Scarecrow who I think is visually my favourite character/villain in the game, and his fear gas stealth segments were both intense and fun as hell. >!(The fake crash sequence I knew was coming, but not when, tho it actually did catch me off guard, and was a nice 4th wall break and a poke at the player's worst fear in this case being losing all their progress)!<

Riddler himself deserves an entire paragraph of praise on his own; this was the most well thought out way of implementing a scavenger hunt/collectibles I have ever seen. The fact that there are so many different challenges such as thinking outside the box to photograph a specific object, checking in secret spots for the Arkham sigils, smashing all of the wind-up teeth, fiddling around with perspective to piece together the hidden question mark, was a delight and genuinely felt like I was participating in one of Riddler's deadly games. And finding out the patients' backstories and personalities through the interview tapes was a joy to both find and listen to.

His voice acting was amazing too, a fresh change of style and presentation, as a sophisticated gentleman who seems equal amounts punchable and admirable, as opposed to Paul Dano's Zodiac killer-esque Riddler in the upcoming Batman film (which I love the design of btw).

The graphics also look amazing despite the game being 12 years old (I played the vanilla edition and not the return to Arkham version btw, and the graphics were still amazing even when I saw the remastered ones), the soundtrack adds to the brilliant brooding atmosphere, and the little detail of Batman's suit slowly being torn and chipped at and worn down as the night progresses really makes you realize the hell he's going through and how long a night it is. The gameplay also varies quite well too, from the action sequences going through the corridors of the asylum, to the climbing vertical areas that remind me a bit of uncharted, to the stealth sections with Scarecrow, to the chase sequence with Killer Croc in the sewers. It has a bit of everything and keeps the pace fresh. I also love how the game is also part Metroidvania, with secret areas being reachable past a certain point of the game, that feeling of satisfaction is one of the reasons why I love that genre.

My only real gripes with the game is the camera angle, having Batman take up 1/3 of the screen like in Shadow of the Colossus feels really off putting and distracting, almost like the camera is a bit broken. I mean, the camera automatically switches to a Dark Souls angle, right behind batman with him in the centre, when entering combat or crouching or sprinting, why couldn't we just have that exact same angle during exploration?

I also feel like Batman moves and does things a bit too slowly at times, in order to knock out an enemy for good you have the option to perform a ground takedown when they're downed, but Batman does this in the slowest way possible, it's like he looks them dead in the eye and reads off their death sentence before slamming their head onto the ground, by which time another enemy would've attacked and stopped you from performing a takedown. Another thing is that the option to grab and throw an enemy is there, but again, he does it so slowly that you almost always get hit during the process rendering it nigh useless. But that's ok since the hand to hand combat is hella satisfying anyway.

My one last bone to pick with the game is that the boss fights, while they look badass as all hell, usually follow the same formula of "Dodge, dodge, throw a batrang, attack boss a few times, beat up incoming wave of henchmen, repeat till dead". Granted there's a few bits of variation in *what* to dodge such as Bane's charge and Poison Ivy's thorns (which prompt a quick time event to escape if you do get caught) but the basic formula to defeat them is kinda repetitive. I understand this would have been all that was possible back then as this game is over a decade old, but today it's just a slight tad bit repetitive.

All in all tho, Batman Arkham Asylum has held up perfectly imo. The game is a damn near masterpiece, from its immersive atmosphere, masterful mechanic designs, fluid combat, and compact and understandable story that doesn't overstay its welcome nor does it feel too short; this game is now one of my favourite games of all time.


I still firmly believe this has one of the best videogame intros of all time. I love that it doesn't throw an explanation as to why are they imprisoning the joker for the presumably hundreth time. Then it makes the player participate in the whole sequence until hell breaks loose. It really puts you in the mood to keep playing more
    Arkham Asylum's intercom chime is etched in my head to this day.

>!Got goosebumps when it played in Arkham Knight during one of Batman's hallucinations recreating Asylum's intro!<

Edit: Just bought the Arkham Collection on Steam for 6 bucks just to experience the madhouse again. What a steal!
        Dun-dun-dun-dun

"Did anyone catch the game last night?"
            DING DONG! Warden Joker Here!
    Arkham City's intro is up there too.
    Couldn’t agree more - one of the strongest intros to a game I can remember, I felt so tense!

I agree with OP about the game in general, and yet I still felt like it started to drag towards the end for me personally. But damn that intro was perfect.
        For me, I felt like I never wanted it to stop! Despite there not being all that much to do since the game was linear, I wanted to keep going on even when the game was finished!
            Oh cool! Good for you that there are many more games in the series then :)
    It does say somewhere in the first 5 minutes that Joker was holding the Mayor hostage at city hall, though they definitely don't make a big deal out of it or shove it in your face, it's just passing dialogue as characters talk. Definitely helps get you right into the story.
        It's alot like PS4 Spider-Man in the way that it doesn't insult you by reintroducing all the characters, it respects the player by assuming you know the world.
            Ps4 Spider-Man took a lot from Asylum. That’s fine though, I liked Asylum a lot.
    >I love that it doesn't throw an explanation as to why are they imprisoning the joker for the presumably hundreth time. Then it makes the player participate in the whole sequence until hell breaks loose.

The whole intro reminds me of Escape from Butcher Bay so much.
    Sorry to necrobump but I hard agree, bro! What a flawless intro IMO. Puts you in the mood of being the Batman near immediately. I'm replaying Arkham Aslyum rn for my first time since beating it back in 2009/2010. When I play old games there is a sense of only doing it for the nostalgia but with this game? It holds up WAY too well to feel it's just nostalgia for me.
The Arkham trilogy in general aged really well. 

All 3 games give you something new to avoid it from being repetitive.

First one obviously started it all with the combat and everything. 2nd added open world. 3rd one gave you the batmobile
    There are four Arkham games aren’t there 

Asylum

City

Origins

Knight
        No there are 6  
Asylum  
City  
Origins  
Knight  
Shadow of Mordor  
Shadow of War
            That is a take 

One I can’t entirely oppose
            No! There are 7!

Asylum

City

Origins

Knight

Shadow of Mordor

Shadow of War

Mad Max

:P
                You forgot Sleeping Dogs.
                    That game actually has a combo system where it diverts enough to not be included. But yeah, otherwise I would've added it
        There are? I bought the Arkham collection years ago and was only 3 games.

I assumed it included all content, but guess not
            A different company made origins so I presume that’s why

Although it’s gameplay is the same and it’s clearly a prologue to the series 

If you haven’t played I highly recommend it, one of the best boss fights in the series, >!deathstroke!<
            You mentioned the Batmobile in the third, that was actually the fourth, Arkham Knight. The bundle may not have included Arkham origins (a prequel, but the third game in the franchise)
                I got a key for origins in exchange for a beta key for hearthstone lol. 

I still can’t believe someone gave me origins for the beta key of a free to play game lol.
                    Collector I guess?
            Origins is lovely, I highly recommend it
        Some people don't count Origins, that was WB thinking they could cheap out now that the series was established by handing it to an in-house studio instead of hiring Rocksteady.

The X-Men Legends/Marvel UA series suffered the same thing.  Once Ravensoft did all the work building a great series, Activision thought they could cheaply produce more by handing it to a shovelware developer.
            You say that as if Origins wasn't a great game in its own right.
            I wish we could get another quality XML or MUA game. Honestly, the closest spiritual successor we got was Marvel Heroes, but that shut down.
    Don't make me say it... Don't make me say it... It's basically a meme at this point among fans...

ackshually arkham origins is just as valid as any other game and improved on some aspects such as the boss fights and feels less reliant on gimmicks than arkham knight durr

(but seriously though they're all great, easily some of my favorite games ever)
        I'm still sad that the multiplayer for origins was shut down so quickly.
            I actually heard that there's a workaround for the PC version. Didn't research enough so I can't quite tell you how it works, but it should be good news for those who really want those damned online-only achievements
                Oh don't even get me started on the online-only achievements lmao.
            there is a way to still play it on pc and there's even a steam group where they regularly play origins multiplayer and finish achievements or just have fun
                That's actually really cool, definitely gonna go bring it up with my friends.
        I like Origins. It's just more of City and the only one in the series that I 100%-ed. Knight is the one when gameplay became tedious.
            Agree. Origins gets a lot of criticism, but I still enjoyed it more than Knight.
            Knight was my favorite Arkham game but it was also the first one I played, so Asylum and City felt like egregious downgrades.
        I think it’s a great game, it just didn’t do enough different to set it apart from Arkham City. We went from the asylum setting in 1, to a more open world setting in 2 to a similar setting for 3, and the Arkham knight/4 had the car stuff which set it apart. Origins is a solid game but not a unique Arkham game.
            They’re all amazing games to get for $5-$10 each
        I didnt even know it existed until another commenter told me lol. I bought the arkham collection and apparently that doesnt include Origins
        As someone who 100%ed the other 3, is it really? I always read about the long bridge to go between areas, goofy premise, and changes that were made to encounters/enemies that made it easy for you to lose combo for cheap reasons.
            City is a much better game. Origins was a slog.
    I never played the third one, but isn't the Batmobile usually spoken about negatively not positively?
        The car was badass, but some had a problem with it being included a bit too much especially since a lot of the missions it was necessary. Arkham games usually let you choose different approaches so that felt like a step back to a lot
        It differs from person to person. I thought it was great to change the pace. 

Arkham city got kinda repetitive near the end already, so I loved it.
        The implementation is solid, and it definitely adds a new dimension to the over all "I'm Batman" feel of the game. It does have a few nifty mechanics such as a mag-boost launch that throws batman sky-high, a winch/grappling-hook that is at first used to brilliant effect for exploration and solving of various Riddler challenges, and the "freeroam" tank mode that offers much more precise maneuverability during the battles with the Militia drones. However, after a certain point, the drone battles become very repetitive, and are a bit of a chore to trudge through as the novelty of the Tank mode wears off in some of the late-game encounters. While not a dealbreaker, the Tank mode doesn't feel as strategic as it should, outside of a few "cat and mouse" type boss encounters. It is definitely a lot of fun blasting around Gotham in the Batmobile though, and the Riddler racetracks (or perhaps "race-tricks?) during the Catwoman "teamup" sections were definitely a highlight for me personally.
            The riddler tracks made no sense to me personally, why was he wanting Batman to race around a track? Was Nigma super into motorsports? There was nothing about those challenges related to wits, just driving, so they felt super out of place.   


The gameplay of them was very fun, it's just weirdly done in the story.
                You do have a point. Though they did at least convey a sense of trickery and deviance that showed concievable traits of the Riddlers personality. Unlike the endless drone tanks thrown out by the Arkham Knight, a man who it seems had every thug, brawler, and mercenary on his payroll, yet the drones only stood as a McGuffin to maintain Batman's "No Kill" policy, which I had a hard time reconciling against the overall ethos that brought about the Militia in the first instance. Surely there was more tactical advantage to be gained by forcing Batman into a hopeless situation by deliberately putting him into a position where he had no choice but to end countless lives to save Gotham. 

Even the Joker never pushed Batman to that point, due to the "Gentleman's Game" between the two of them over the years.
                    For sure, the Batmobile was a big disappointment to me for the most part, the drones and the tank mode just felt like they were added to appeal to a wider audience. It's definitely not really fitting with the no killing policy, what if a shot misses and hits a building somewhere? It's also not really Batman's style. He wouldn't bring a tank to fight people. He'd probably find a way to emp the drones on mass or take them down some other way, it just isn't a very batman solution to a problem. Which was unfortunate as so much of that game was awesome, even if it felt shoved aside in favour of the bat tank. Not to mention having the Deathstroke boss battle be basically another tank battle, which also defeated the purpose of specifying all the others were just drones. 

I think in a lot of ways they were unsure where to go past Joker, the whole plot feels a lot less thought out than the previous games.
                        The Deathstroke tank battle was just a rehash of the Arkham Knight boss fight, with a couple of extra bodyguard units. I can see Deathstroke in a tank though, as he is the woorld's "best" mercenary, and basically a DC version of Marvel's supersoldier and weapon-x projects. Not to mention that Deathstroke is Batman's equal in combat, as well as the history, and even to a point respect, between the two of them as highly skilled, highly trained combatants. There was the same level of "respect" and rivalry between Batman and Joker, which brought a balance to that whole relationship.

Arkham Knight on the other hand, was never willing to admit that he wasn't an equal, so he threw a tantrum, and went after Joker to prove a point that was doomed to failure from the outset, which Batman knew already before the fact, which is why he didn't want to let him take that path as the outcome was obvious. Joker bent over backwards to prove that point to AK, and then Scarecrow stepped in as his mentor, because he was intelligent, but also not an equal with Batman, and also had a chip on his shoulder because Batman had snubbed him by letting Croc get him. 

Don't forget that a large part of the story of Arkham City was essentially batman trying to save Joker from himself, so when Joker wound up dead, it had the same emotional impact on Batman,as when young Bruce lost his parents in the alleyway. The only reason the Emo Army (TM) was able to seize control of Gotham, was because Batman had lost one of his oldest and closest "friends" when Joker died, which compounded the guilt he felt over not being able to impart any emotional stability onto Jason Todd, which led to Joker assaulting him due to his impulsive teen angst to prove himself. Then throw in the power vaccuum that was left when Joker died, because enemies like Two Face and Penguin no longer had anyone they truly feared.

So we end up with Batman being off the wagon and unprepared for the assault, which is why I cant understand why they were unmanned drones, as having real people in the tanks would have been the smart strategy by AK. It would have also fit the blatantly overt "fuck you, dad" mindset that was driving AK at the time, by forcing Batman to retreat instead of going in as a one man army. Though one man army kind of makes sense when you look at the big picture, as it was Gotham's last stand.

As lazy as the drones were as a McGuffin, Batman was not running at full capacity mentally due to blaming himself for the deaths of both Joker and Jason, and was also spread thin due to the war that the rest of the rogues gallery were waging on Gotham, and then Scarecrow resurfaced bringing his new and improved toxin, which created enough of a diversion for AK to overwhelm what little capacity Gotham PD had to maintain the last remaining scraps of status quo. The overall premise of the story was solid, but it just wasn't implemented as well as it could have been. This was the epic finale of the Arkham saga, so of course it had to play out like a Michael Bay movie, all pyrotechnics and action heroes, bigger and badder than before. 

I honestly think that a lot of the sidequests were just shoehorned in to inflate play time,as were the tank battles, much to the detriment of story pacing. Obviously it couldn't have been anyone other than Batman that brought in Two Face, Penguin, et al, even if that was just going through the motions at this point in the saga. 

I did thoroughly enjoy the Man-Bat and Pyg quests though, as they brought something new to the table, and were quite enjoyable as far as the pacing and lore. Azrael made sense as a tutorial challenge, and didn't drag out too long. The Militia checkpoints and command stations were tolerable, and kind of fit in without being forced, but then there was those damn mines, which was where they were obviously scraping the bottom of the barrel, as that's where the drones were used to artificially extend those encounters. They should have had tank squads just roaming the city from the outset, patrolling like they were during the AK and Deathstroke tank encounters, as that would have made more sense as to where they kept coming from when defusing the bombs, instead of just randomly appearing right on cue, perfectly scripted just to be a pain in the ass.
        I liked it but didn't at the same time. Fundamentally it's a fun mechanic that they introduced. But it also felt a little over used and took away from the core loop of a beat-em up game. It's been a while so maybe I'm exaggerating but tank battles and races took up a good third or so of the main story and side quests.

I get why they did it in a way. They'd been putting out Arkham games once every couple of years for quite a while and needed to freshen things up. It just felt a little overdone. But without adding something new then the franchise was kind of coming to a hiatus point where they'd just be churning out the exact same game.

That said it's still a pretty good game. If you're like me and find yourself coming back to the series every once in a while then playing Arkham City is still a bunch of fun. Just maybe not as exceptionally good as the first two titles.

Now that I've been without a batman beatem up game for so long [I really can't wait for the upcoming Suicide Squad game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl0uj3VAO1o)
        I didn't like it personally, it made the batman parts of the game feel redundant as so much of the gameplay was shoehorned into the batmobile which is a goddamn tank for some reason, feels like they wanted to make it more actioney for COD fans. The tank gameplay was pretty awful.
        You should play the third one. Imo it is the best of the trilogy gameplay wise. The batmobile being a bit repetitive is the only con. Story is kinda predictable but all in all, a REALLY good game.
        The Batmoble definitely has its share of haters. I personally enjoyed it and it's not like you have to use it in the open world outside of missions. Gliding around is still as fun as ever
    I have the Arkham Trilogy, do you think I would enjoy it if I just was never into Batman?
        If you were never into Batman, hopefully after playing the game you will be kinda like me. They're amazing, and pretty much the reason I started reading and consuming so much Batman fiction.
            Thanks, will give it a go.
        I was kinda meh about superheroes at the time, but really loved those games. It also helps that you don't need to know pretty much anything about the characters beforehand, but if you wish to know, each game has a sort of encyclopedia about them
            Thanks. I probably feel the same about superheroes now as you were back then. I will give it a go.
    It's really no wonder 2 of the 3 games in the trilogy won game of the year! I'm so excited to see what city will be like!
    I’ve only played Arkham knight and it was a masterpiece: the way enemies react to how you take down others is implemented so beautifully makes the game feel truly alive during stealth combat…
Arkham Asylum holds up so well. The combat was so solid that every sequel was just a refinement rather than a total evolution of the system, and over a decade later Asylum's combat is still better than most modern AAA titles. They struck gold with that system.

The atmosphere of the game is also unparalleled. It feels so authentic but also quite unique with how unsettling and adult the tone is. That part when Scarecrow takes you through the morgue is insane and when I was like a 11 year old kid I was so engaged and almost afraid of it. 

Every time I replay the games, Asylum is the only one that doesn't overstay its welcome. It's just built different.
    The Scarecrow sections are some of the highlights that bring me back for a playthrough from time to time. The subtlety of the manipulations get me every time, despite knowing when to expect them, with the slow build of the psychological effect of the fear toxin, and especially *THAT* mindfucking twist!
        It was insane. I was so excited go see what Rocksteady would do with the character in Arkham Knight and then...

Absolutely fuck all. Just generic race tracks, as if the Batmobile didn't already have enough forced content as it is.
            I didn't mind the Riddler races, to me they were a fun diversion from the "generic" point to point driving element, i thought. It was the constant drone battles that i took issue with in AK. While they were fun to begin with, they became a chore as the game went progressed. I had hoped for more strategic elements to the Tank battle modes, along the lines of the several "heavy tank" encounters, though even they seemed to ramp up the difficulty in a way that involved more luck than strategy, more akin to a game of checkers than chess!

I definitely expected more from the fact that scarecrow was back as a protagonist, that side of things definitely fell short of my expectations as soon as i realised the only reason he was doing any of what he was doing, was because batman had let Croc take grab him in the sewers under Arkham Asylum, and he had fallen in with the AK "chip on the shoulder because batman is better than them" crew. And with even just a rudimentary understanding of general Batman lore outside of the Arkham universe, I saw the Arkham Knight reveal coming from a mile off, despite the fact that he had been spruiked as an "original" character. 

Still though, as overly ambitious as the game was, I did have fun with it up to the point of unlocking the "short" version of the true ending, but gave up on the riddler collectibles to youtube the "final definitive directors cut expanded" ending, not long after i had finished the rest of the Most Wanted lists. 

I think the main issue with AK, was that it was a much more sprawling open world than Arkham City, and as a result felt like a lot of the "generic" militia sidequests were more filler than killer, especially the drone fights when disarming the bombs, which became more bullet-hell type gameplay designed to justify more forced time in Tank-mode, rather than intelligently planned Batman incursions utilizing forethought and planning.
    Asylum is shorter than the other games in the series and apart from arkham knight feels the best game to replay multiple times. You could argue that it is better than arkham knight is a lot of aspects and I would still agree.
>You'll most likely have heard of that joke that Spiderman on PS4 makes you feel like Spiderman. Well, what that game did to Spidey, this game does to Bats.

Funny enough that joke started because of Arkham Asylum. Greg Miller was the first to say it in IGN's review of the game
    Correct, this trope was originally related to Batman, the Spiderman relations are just a play on it.  I'm not sure Greg Miller was "the first", here's a whole bunch of reviewers who said the same thing some with the same publishing date as the IGN review - https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-game-really-makes-you-feel-like-batman
I played it few months ago for the first time and liked it but personally I thought that every aspect was better and improved in Arkham City. Especially combat felt smoother, controls/movement was better, there were more tools, skills, also music and story improved with more quests and dialogues. The only thing I missed was linear design, I didn't care about open world in City.

And Riddler Trophies were ridiculous in both games. I had zero fun in finding them and there was like 1000000 of them.
    Riddler trophies in Asylum were pretty straightforward to me. Trophies in City got ridiculous.
        I will say tho, some of the puzzles were a bit too obscure. The ones that involved a question mark that was visible in detective mode were worded in such a way that I spent ages wandering the map searching for an actual puzzle piece (A puzzle has many sides but not all are visible)
            i can hear his voice
                Hi diddle diddle, time for a riddle!
    Huh, I for one preferred Asylum to City in most ways.
    It's mostly agreed City improved on everything from the first game. +1 on liking the tighter level design of AA better - I loved me the massive Gotham, but it didn't have the same character Asylum had and every once in a while got repetitive since it was way longer. 

AA was just a comic come to life - doesn't overstay its welcome, it's right to the point with top execution (bossfights aside). I'd rate them the same even if City is improved in many ways.
        Yeah that's where Asylum shines over City, the pacing and the atmosphere are unrivalled in that game.
    Takes some brainpower to solve them
    The quick fire gadgets made combat *much* better. Adding his gadgets into the fights helped you feel resourceful, and the increased enemy variety made it even more important that you're adapting on the fly to the challenges Batman faced.

I personally loved the Cape and gliding mechanics in Arkham City and Arkham knight. They made simply exploring the open world setting that much more enjoyable.

At least Riddler trophies were optional. You didn't need them to finish the game. It's one of the things that taught me I didn't have to 100% everything to enjoy games anymore.
I got this on steam for free with my graphics card a few years ago, I think you’ve convinced me to actually fire it up. I’m superhero averse but I enjoyed Spiderman PS4 as it was just great on its own merits. Great post
    It’s absolutely worth it! The nice thing about firing it up on a whim is that it’s fairly short (maybe 8 hours?), so it’s not a huge time commitment. And you’ll know in the first hour or so if it’s for you.
Arkham Asylum is probably the best superhero game there is. It’s really dark. More so than the others imo.

Witnessing or being alluded to eventually all the guards dying a horrible death is something. Watching the decay of the entire Asylum over the course of the game - paired with Batman himself getting more torn up and battle worn is something I really wish more games would do to their protagonist.
The Arkham combat is my favorite game mechanic if all time. I'd spend hours in the challenge maps just kicking ass. 

Then the stealth aspect as a bonus, also fun as challenge maps. 

Loved Asylum at the time but after the amazing traversal in City it was hard to go back. 

Anyway lucky you who still has another 3 games to churn. I waited years in between so basically restarted the skills I had gained.
Do the later games move the camera back / expand fov? Get mad motion sickness with the original and never bothered to try the sequels
my best memory from 100%ing this game when I was a kid was riddler challenges you'd get for framing the camera in a very exact way to answer vague riddles such as something like [Gotham radio host bla bla] and youd get it by zooming in on the radio in a change room which at first just comes off as expository dialogue. not only did that challenge players in a very unique way and through that build up the lore as well as a cool way to introduce people to batmans villains that couldn't make it into the game.. BUT it seems to me it also forced the developers to make sure that because a large part of side activity was zooming in close to objects most of the time it only made the graphics that more impressive. some games can sometimes be lazy with visuals when it comes to getting really close to objects. but not Arkham asylum. truly a one of kind game that makes me feel like the team behind this game worked their asses off for details that a lot of other games would not view as worth the effort
Loved Asylum. Didn't care for the sequels.
    And friends have given me the weird eye whenever I say this to them. It's like people automatically assume that just because a game is bigger it also means it has to be better by default. And yeah, the sequels aren't bad games at all, but the first game is by far the best of the saga because of how well it is designed in terms of scope and what it was set out to do.
    Yeah. I played through Asylum recently and enjoyed it all over again, then continued onto City and immediately recalled why I bounced off that one when it came out. The controlled freedom of Asylum gave better direction for the series instead of just saying "let's fly around a city" and do whatever
    Yeah personally I don’t like spreading out content like that, Asylum is tight and condensed and every spot has a purpose/character whereas in City there are entire map sections where nothing is going on, group of 5 enemies on a nondescript sidewalk





Honestly been tired of ‘open-world’ for the sake of it for a hell of a long time now





Wish they kept the games tighter, City loses me every time I give it a try, so much trekking back and forth
I got a bunch of the Batman games for free a while back on Epic, definitely gonna play through them one day.
Just $5 on steam sale right now, too. Thanks for the recommendation.
still the best one of the trilogy (or the four Batman games). I think city and knight went into the wrong directions.
    I agree. 

Personally I thought Rocksteady refused to evolve the formula enough. They constantly give themselves convenient narrative reasons to have empty open worlds rather than applying their mechanics to a living, breathing city. 

I could forgive it with Arkham City, but there was no excuses for Arkham Knight to once again be the same old "set over one night" routine followed by a convenient city evacuation. You're on (at the time) next gen hardware, and you've finally got to Gotham City. Why wouldn't you have fun with that? How does the Arkham formula work in a living world? How can Bruce Wayne play a part? What sort of dynamic world activities would there be? They could have done so much and took the lazy way out, and they're doing it yet again with Suicide Squad where we've moved from evacuated Gotham to... alien invasion Metropolis. Just once I beg they actually try and make a proper open world.
        If you're thinking of something like Spider-Man PS4 , I really don't think that would work for Bats or the Squad.

Spidey is the kind of guy who would stop and help anyone he comes across that has an issue. That's just the guy he is.

Bats? He's only ever in 3 places: the Batcave, on top of the police roof getting news from Gordon about where he needs to go, and the place where stuff happens. Yeah, he's usually on patrol, but if he gets a call to go to Arkham, he won't stop to help the old lady getting mugged, since a lot more people could get hurt if he doesn't, while Spidey could afford the detour (in part also because of how his villains work).

This goes double for the Squad. Waller wouldn't let them deviate from the mission by even an inch (which makes me curious how the open world would work there), and any civilians would run screaming at the sight of them, so there's no point in having a "proper open world".
            Then just don't do crappy throwaway side tasks like preventing granny muggings. Maybe have them as a random minor event if you're roaming alleys, but rare and not a thing where you have to stop 30 of them for a dumb achievement. Don't do the AssCreed/Skyrim/DA:I thing with a big shallow world full of boring radiant tasks.

Have day sections with Bruce doing socialite mingling/Wayne business meetings as spy/talky missions. You can introduce new characters that way, in well directed story missions like in RDR2. 

At night he can don the suit and do his thing using whatever info he got. Maybe you're investigating something and you see the batsignal light up, so you go have a chat with Gordon and enter a several quest deep side-story that moves along the main plot.

There are much more intriguing ways to do this than another 'random goons in empty city with bosses sometimes'. They just do it because it's easier and they still sell like hotcakes.

I'd agree on Suicide Squad, that game should be more like infiltrator action missions - but Bruce does half the work as himself in many comics/animated episodes/movies, so it would work well in a standard functioning Gotham. 

For example, investigating the Falcones operating a legitimate looking business while hatching some plots wouldn't work if Gotham is just random goon filled again.
                You've got it spot on and some of your examples are exactly the sort of things I wanted from the Arkham games after the first two. 

Rocksteady stuck to their corner rather than branching out, and completely wasted the opportunity of creating a modern open world Gotham City.
                Man, I personally disagree greatly with some of this. I think a city full of a bunch of batman villians to stop is just a lot more interesting than the idea of walking around doing Bruce Wayne stuff. It reminds me of the Spiderman PS4 game where (for me, personally) all the walking around sections as Peter at the feast hall and with MJ and as a scientist were all super dull and by far the worst parts of the game. Like, to me, the Arkham games were some of the very best open worlds, filled with side quests that were actually meaningful because they were stopping all the various villians. And rather than a bunch of random dumb collectibles, they only had one type of collectible, the riddler trophies, which if you don't want to run around doing collectibles, you don't have to, but they atleast had a real storyline reasoning, rather than just existing for no purpose.

The Arkham games and the Assassins Creed games are on complete opposite ends of the open world spectrum in my opinion.
                    Leaving the entirely hypothetical idea of BW sections aside, I'd rather never have a Batman game again if it's more of the same. Time for crime solving in a normal populated city. No need to entirely miss the larger point that keeping Gotham empty is a played out concept.
                        I didn't miss the point, I just disagree with the entire premise myself. Anyways, agree to disagree, have a good day.
            > Yeah, he's usually on patrol, but if he gets a call to go to Arkham, he won't stop to help the old lady getting mugged, since a lot more people could get hurt if he doesn't

Huh?  He most definitely would stop the old lady getting mugged.  Source where he did not?
    Especially in hindsight how tired open world games have become (at least for me personally). But I guess it was games like the Arkham trilogy that helped continue to push it into that direction. And at least the Arkham worlds felt like they were full of things to do.
    for sure. They seem to think that an open world game MUST have like 400hrs of play time. It feels like they wanted a skyrim like batman game. Its nice if there are lots of things to do but don't make the main story line dependent on grinding the same sort of objectives over and over.
        How is the main story line in any of the Arkham games dependent on grinding objectives? All the side quests/riddler trophies have no bearing on the main story.
bruh, I was going through my steam library, saw Arkham Asylum and decided to download it. Opened reddit while it was downloading and this is the first post I see. This has to be a sign.
I’m so envious of you getting to play Arkham City for the the first time. It improves on Asylum in almost every single discernible way and is one of the few perfect sequels in my opinion. You mentioned that you loved the riddler trophies in Asylum, well you’re gonna lose your shit in Arkham City. They managed to do the Riddler in that without it feeling goofy and campy, and with enough narrative hooks to keep you invested in solving all of the challenges.
    I do agree that storyline wise the Riddler in City is much more engaging, but I found some of the actual puzzles so annoying rather than just straight up difficult that I think I barely 100%'d it once.
    I think, besides combat, Arkham City moved away from Asylum’s strengths. I felt crazy back when it launched and still do now when I hear this, Asylum is a much tighter and better focused game




‘Open world’ is an unnecessary choice more often than not, and Arkham City is a prime example. Spread out everything and water it down
        This “everything was watered down” point of view never made any sense. It takes place in Gotham City. I guarantee you that if the game was more linear, many, many more people would bemoan the fact that it had the potential to let players explore more of Gotham. 

Jumping, grappling, gliding, climbing, swinging across the roofs of Gotham as Batman _and_ Catwoman is worth the price of admission alone. This is without discussing the very _active_ nature of traversal across the open world in AC. There is much to do and much to appreciate at any area of the city. Batman is the protector of Gotham. To criminals, he is never seen but seemingly always watching. Arkham City indulges in and delivers on this fantasy _hard_. The night ramps up in intensity with every single hour and villain introduced. The streets of Gotham steadily filled and replaced by different gangs in different areas of the city, which tells a small narrative of the gang wars going on throughout. These thugs eventually get access to firepower, and your traversal of the city and tactics to approaching areas has to change with the capabilities of your enemies. Next thing you know you’re fighting Ninjas on rooftops. This is probably one of the best pieces of Batman media for its ability to make you, the player micro manage and overcome one of Batman’s most dangerous nights. When I finished Arkham Asylum, one of my first thoughts was “that was awesome! I wonder if they could make that work in a full Gotham City!” 

They pulled that off spectacularly in Arkham City. I’m truly sorry that you can’t see or appreciate that and mark it as just another generic open word. And the “unfocused” argument is doubly perplexing when you remember how many condensed and self contained locales there are featured throughout the main story. The Iceberg Lounge, The City of Wonder and the old subway station are just some examples of self contained areas found throughout the open world that have great level design, featuring many ways to tackle encounters and progress.  

You may not agree with the direction of the game but you cannot deny that it was done masterfully well by the team at rocksteady.
        That's a lot of opinions stated as facts.  Clearly there's 2 schools of thought on this, I personally enjoyed the sequels better and I don't really care for open world games.
I'll never forget that part with the long hallway... I won't say more to save spoilers but I will never forget how much that scene blew my mind.
Did you play with a controller or keyboard and mouse? I played Arkham Asylum on PC years ago. I had fun with it but eventually had to give up on some boss towards the end because the camera and controls for k&m were completely unworkable. I don't even remember the details, but it was so disappointing.
    Not sure about Asylum, but in City the keyboard was very nice for quickfiring all the different gadgets in combat by double tapping the number keys.

For overall movement I guess a controller is nicer, but I never had issues with kb+m in this series.
    I mean… just plug in a controller to finish that part?
    Personally, I usually play games that don't require fine aiming with a controller. 

Much more enjoyable that way IMO.
One of the few games that I 100% completed; due to all the collectables being a puzzle rather then just strewn around the game world.
I think I played Asylum and City last year… or maybe the year before. Time doesn’t exist these days.

But yeah it was flawless. Made me a Batman fan just from that. City wasn’t as good, but still fine. But I 100%’d Asylum because it was so good.
At times I flip-flop as to whether or not I like Asylum or City more. If it wasn’t for that awful final boss, it would be Asylum pretty handily. It’s a near perfect slice of Batman, and despite some fine-tuning and new features, the sequels never felt quite as tight or atmospheric to me.
Arkham city has great nostalgia for fans of the animated series in the 90s. 

Arkham city literally expanded on that and made it even better. 

Origins almost ruined it by rehashing so much of the previous material. 

Arkham knight saved the series and was a perfect wrap up to the whole series.
    Origins is my favorite
> The graphics also look amazing despite the game being 12 years old 

There are games that look good that were made decades ago.  Ridge Racer R4 for example, because of color palettes and other art choices.  F-Zero and SMW on SNES still look good. Games look good because of art.  “Technology” is superficial.

Also 12 years is a very short time in this century.  If it was 1989 to 2001, that would be significant (that’s like going from NES to PS2).  But games haven’t changed since Arkham 1 came out, AAA games are exactly the same but with more pixels. 

Anyway, everything good about Arkham was good on Day 1 and was praised as such.

The idea of a thing that is good “aging well” is a misleading viral concept that makes people *expect* old things to be bad.  You’d be laughed out of the room if you expressed surprise that “old things are good?!” in music, painting, theatre, movies, literature, everyone knows old things are good.  For some sad tragic reason gamers don’t understand this, probably because they have no conscious appreciation of any art form…including videogames, which they only praise for technology instead of artistry.
Arkham Asylum is great Zelda-like game and definitely top tier game of its decade.
if you think asylum's combat is smooth, wait till you play knight
Best combat flow. So smooth and satisfying!
The final boss fight was a bit of a letdown honestly. 

I played City, then Asylum, both on Xbox. Just picked up the collection in the Winter sale. Should I play Arkham Knight first? Or Origins?
The physics in this game are amaaaazing(if u enable nvidia physx in pc)for a game that come in 2009
It still ranks up there for me, even after playing Arkham City. Asylum and City feel like different experiences for me, the former being a claustrophic, atmospheric metroidvania-like with great gameplay to boot, and the latter being a grand, emotional adventure across a larger environment with gameplay I would genuinely consider to be flawless. So while I'll always say I prefer City, Asylum is incredibly close behind.
I've had Batman Origins and Asylum in my library for God knows how long. Just started playing Origins today and i'm blown away.
Asylum is probably my favorite of the series when it comes to atmosphere and aesthetic. Arkham Asylum genuinely terrified me when I first initially played it. I can tell the other entries TRIED to convey the same sense of impending dread and doom, but I don't think anything has come close.
Arkham Asylum's intercom chime is etched in my head to this day.

>!Got goosebumps when it played in Arkham Knight during one of Batman's hallucinations recreating Asylum's intro!<

Edit: Just bought the Arkham Collection on Steam for 6 bucks just to experience the madhouse again. What a steal!
    Dun-dun-dun-dun

"Did anyone catch the game last night?"
        DING DONG! Warden Joker Here!
Arkham City's intro is up there too.
Couldn’t agree more - one of the strongest intros to a game I can remember, I felt so tense!

I agree with OP about the game in general, and yet I still felt like it started to drag towards the end for me personally. But damn that intro was perfect.
    For me, I felt like I never wanted it to stop! Despite there not being all that much to do since the game was linear, I wanted to keep going on even when the game was finished!
        Oh cool! Good for you that there are many more games in the series then :)
It does say somewhere in the first 5 minutes that Joker was holding the Mayor hostage at city hall, though they definitely don't make a big deal out of it or shove it in your face, it's just passing dialogue as characters talk. Definitely helps get you right into the story.
    It's alot like PS4 Spider-Man in the way that it doesn't insult you by reintroducing all the characters, it respects the player by assuming you know the world.
        Ps4 Spider-Man took a lot from Asylum. That’s fine though, I liked Asylum a lot.
>I love that it doesn't throw an explanation as to why are they imprisoning the joker for the presumably hundreth time. Then it makes the player participate in the whole sequence until hell breaks loose.

The whole intro reminds me of Escape from Butcher Bay so much.
Sorry to necrobump but I hard agree, bro! What a flawless intro IMO. Puts you in the mood of being the Batman near immediately. I'm replaying Arkham Aslyum rn for my first time since beating it back in 2009/2010. When I play old games there is a sense of only doing it for the nostalgia but with this game? It holds up WAY too well to feel it's just nostalgia for me.
There are four Arkham games aren’t there 

Asylum

City

Origins

Knight
    No there are 6  
Asylum  
City  
Origins  
Knight  
Shadow of Mordor  
Shadow of War
        That is a take 

One I can’t entirely oppose
        No! There are 7!

Asylum

City

Origins

Knight

Shadow of Mordor

Shadow of War

Mad Max

:P
            You forgot Sleeping Dogs.
                That game actually has a combo system where it diverts enough to not be included. But yeah, otherwise I would've added it
    There are? I bought the Arkham collection years ago and was only 3 games.

I assumed it included all content, but guess not
        A different company made origins so I presume that’s why

Although it’s gameplay is the same and it’s clearly a prologue to the series 

If you haven’t played I highly recommend it, one of the best boss fights in the series, >!deathstroke!<
        You mentioned the Batmobile in the third, that was actually the fourth, Arkham Knight. The bundle may not have included Arkham origins (a prequel, but the third game in the franchise)
            I got a key for origins in exchange for a beta key for hearthstone lol. 

I still can’t believe someone gave me origins for the beta key of a free to play game lol.
                Collector I guess?
        Origins is lovely, I highly recommend it
    Some people don't count Origins, that was WB thinking they could cheap out now that the series was established by handing it to an in-house studio instead of hiring Rocksteady.

The X-Men Legends/Marvel UA series suffered the same thing.  Once Ravensoft did all the work building a great series, Activision thought they could cheaply produce more by handing it to a shovelware developer.
        You say that as if Origins wasn't a great game in its own right.
        I wish we could get another quality XML or MUA game. Honestly, the closest spiritual successor we got was Marvel Heroes, but that shut down.
Don't make me say it... Don't make me say it... It's basically a meme at this point among fans...

ackshually arkham origins is just as valid as any other game and improved on some aspects such as the boss fights and feels less reliant on gimmicks than arkham knight durr

(but seriously though they're all great, easily some of my favorite games ever)
    I'm still sad that the multiplayer for origins was shut down so quickly.
        I actually heard that there's a workaround for the PC version. Didn't research enough so I can't quite tell you how it works, but it should be good news for those who really want those damned online-only achievements
            Oh don't even get me started on the online-only achievements lmao.
        there is a way to still play it on pc and there's even a steam group where they regularly play origins multiplayer and finish achievements or just have fun
            That's actually really cool, definitely gonna go bring it up with my friends.
    I like Origins. It's just more of City and the only one in the series that I 100%-ed. Knight is the one when gameplay became tedious.
        Agree. Origins gets a lot of criticism, but I still enjoyed it more than Knight.
        Knight was my favorite Arkham game but it was also the first one I played, so Asylum and City felt like egregious downgrades.
    I think it’s a great game, it just didn’t do enough different to set it apart from Arkham City. We went from the asylum setting in 1, to a more open world setting in 2 to a similar setting for 3, and the Arkham knight/4 had the car stuff which set it apart. Origins is a solid game but not a unique Arkham game.
        They’re all amazing games to get for $5-$10 each
    I didnt even know it existed until another commenter told me lol. I bought the arkham collection and apparently that doesnt include Origins
    As someone who 100%ed the other 3, is it really? I always read about the long bridge to go between areas, goofy premise, and changes that were made to encounters/enemies that made it easy for you to lose combo for cheap reasons.
        City is a much better game. Origins was a slog.
I never played the third one, but isn't the Batmobile usually spoken about negatively not positively?
    The car was badass, but some had a problem with it being included a bit too much especially since a lot of the missions it was necessary. Arkham games usually let you choose different approaches so that felt like a step back to a lot
    It differs from person to person. I thought it was great to change the pace. 

Arkham city got kinda repetitive near the end already, so I loved it.
    The implementation is solid, and it definitely adds a new dimension to the over all "I'm Batman" feel of the game. It does have a few nifty mechanics such as a mag-boost launch that throws batman sky-high, a winch/grappling-hook that is at first used to brilliant effect for exploration and solving of various Riddler challenges, and the "freeroam" tank mode that offers much more precise maneuverability during the battles with the Militia drones. However, after a certain point, the drone battles become very repetitive, and are a bit of a chore to trudge through as the novelty of the Tank mode wears off in some of the late-game encounters. While not a dealbreaker, the Tank mode doesn't feel as strategic as it should, outside of a few "cat and mouse" type boss encounters. It is definitely a lot of fun blasting around Gotham in the Batmobile though, and the Riddler racetracks (or perhaps "race-tricks?) during the Catwoman "teamup" sections were definitely a highlight for me personally.
        The riddler tracks made no sense to me personally, why was he wanting Batman to race around a track? Was Nigma super into motorsports? There was nothing about those challenges related to wits, just driving, so they felt super out of place.   


The gameplay of them was very fun, it's just weirdly done in the story.
            You do have a point. Though they did at least convey a sense of trickery and deviance that showed concievable traits of the Riddlers personality. Unlike the endless drone tanks thrown out by the Arkham Knight, a man who it seems had every thug, brawler, and mercenary on his payroll, yet the drones only stood as a McGuffin to maintain Batman's "No Kill" policy, which I had a hard time reconciling against the overall ethos that brought about the Militia in the first instance. Surely there was more tactical advantage to be gained by forcing Batman into a hopeless situation by deliberately putting him into a position where he had no choice but to end countless lives to save Gotham. 

Even the Joker never pushed Batman to that point, due to the "Gentleman's Game" between the two of them over the years.
                For sure, the Batmobile was a big disappointment to me for the most part, the drones and the tank mode just felt like they were added to appeal to a wider audience. It's definitely not really fitting with the no killing policy, what if a shot misses and hits a building somewhere? It's also not really Batman's style. He wouldn't bring a tank to fight people. He'd probably find a way to emp the drones on mass or take them down some other way, it just isn't a very batman solution to a problem. Which was unfortunate as so much of that game was awesome, even if it felt shoved aside in favour of the bat tank. Not to mention having the Deathstroke boss battle be basically another tank battle, which also defeated the purpose of specifying all the others were just drones. 

I think in a lot of ways they were unsure where to go past Joker, the whole plot feels a lot less thought out than the previous games.
                    The Deathstroke tank battle was just a rehash of the Arkham Knight boss fight, with a couple of extra bodyguard units. I can see Deathstroke in a tank though, as he is the woorld's "best" mercenary, and basically a DC version of Marvel's supersoldier and weapon-x projects. Not to mention that Deathstroke is Batman's equal in combat, as well as the history, and even to a point respect, between the two of them as highly skilled, highly trained combatants. There was the same level of "respect" and rivalry between Batman and Joker, which brought a balance to that whole relationship.

Arkham Knight on the other hand, was never willing to admit that he wasn't an equal, so he threw a tantrum, and went after Joker to prove a point that was doomed to failure from the outset, which Batman knew already before the fact, which is why he didn't want to let him take that path as the outcome was obvious. Joker bent over backwards to prove that point to AK, and then Scarecrow stepped in as his mentor, because he was intelligent, but also not an equal with Batman, and also had a chip on his shoulder because Batman had snubbed him by letting Croc get him. 

Don't forget that a large part of the story of Arkham City was essentially batman trying to save Joker from himself, so when Joker wound up dead, it had the same emotional impact on Batman,as when young Bruce lost his parents in the alleyway. The only reason the Emo Army (TM) was able to seize control of Gotham, was because Batman had lost one of his oldest and closest "friends" when Joker died, which compounded the guilt he felt over not being able to impart any emotional stability onto Jason Todd, which led to Joker assaulting him due to his impulsive teen angst to prove himself. Then throw in the power vaccuum that was left when Joker died, because enemies like Two Face and Penguin no longer had anyone they truly feared.

So we end up with Batman being off the wagon and unprepared for the assault, which is why I cant understand why they were unmanned drones, as having real people in the tanks would have been the smart strategy by AK. It would have also fit the blatantly overt "fuck you, dad" mindset that was driving AK at the time, by forcing Batman to retreat instead of going in as a one man army. Though one man army kind of makes sense when you look at the big picture, as it was Gotham's last stand.

As lazy as the drones were as a McGuffin, Batman was not running at full capacity mentally due to blaming himself for the deaths of both Joker and Jason, and was also spread thin due to the war that the rest of the rogues gallery were waging on Gotham, and then Scarecrow resurfaced bringing his new and improved toxin, which created enough of a diversion for AK to overwhelm what little capacity Gotham PD had to maintain the last remaining scraps of status quo. The overall premise of the story was solid, but it just wasn't implemented as well as it could have been. This was the epic finale of the Arkham saga, so of course it had to play out like a Michael Bay movie, all pyrotechnics and action heroes, bigger and badder than before. 

I honestly think that a lot of the sidequests were just shoehorned in to inflate play time,as were the tank battles, much to the detriment of story pacing. Obviously it couldn't have been anyone other than Batman that brought in Two Face, Penguin, et al, even if that was just going through the motions at this point in the saga. 

I did thoroughly enjoy the Man-Bat and Pyg quests though, as they brought something new to the table, and were quite enjoyable as far as the pacing and lore. Azrael made sense as a tutorial challenge, and didn't drag out too long. The Militia checkpoints and command stations were tolerable, and kind of fit in without being forced, but then there was those damn mines, which was where they were obviously scraping the bottom of the barrel, as that's where the drones were used to artificially extend those encounters. They should have had tank squads just roaming the city from the outset, patrolling like they were during the AK and Deathstroke tank encounters, as that would have made more sense as to where they kept coming from when defusing the bombs, instead of just randomly appearing right on cue, perfectly scripted just to be a pain in the ass.
    I liked it but didn't at the same time. Fundamentally it's a fun mechanic that they introduced. But it also felt a little over used and took away from the core loop of a beat-em up game. It's been a while so maybe I'm exaggerating but tank battles and races took up a good third or so of the main story and side quests.

I get why they did it in a way. They'd been putting out Arkham games once every couple of years for quite a while and needed to freshen things up. It just felt a little overdone. But without adding something new then the franchise was kind of coming to a hiatus point where they'd just be churning out the exact same game.

That said it's still a pretty good game. If you're like me and find yourself coming back to the series every once in a while then playing Arkham City is still a bunch of fun. Just maybe not as exceptionally good as the first two titles.

Now that I've been without a batman beatem up game for so long [I really can't wait for the upcoming Suicide Squad game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl0uj3VAO1o)
    I didn't like it personally, it made the batman parts of the game feel redundant as so much of the gameplay was shoehorned into the batmobile which is a goddamn tank for some reason, feels like they wanted to make it more actioney for COD fans. The tank gameplay was pretty awful.
    You should play the third one. Imo it is the best of the trilogy gameplay wise. The batmobile being a bit repetitive is the only con. Story is kinda predictable but all in all, a REALLY good game.
    The Batmoble definitely has its share of haters. I personally enjoyed it and it's not like you have to use it in the open world outside of missions. Gliding around is still as fun as ever
I have the Arkham Trilogy, do you think I would enjoy it if I just was never into Batman?
    If you were never into Batman, hopefully after playing the game you will be kinda like me. They're amazing, and pretty much the reason I started reading and consuming so much Batman fiction.
        Thanks, will give it a go.
    I was kinda meh about superheroes at the time, but really loved those games. It also helps that you don't need to know pretty much anything about the characters beforehand, but if you wish to know, each game has a sort of encyclopedia about them
        Thanks. I probably feel the same about superheroes now as you were back then. I will give it a go.
It's really no wonder 2 of the 3 games in the trilogy won game of the year! I'm so excited to see what city will be like!
I’ve only played Arkham knight and it was a masterpiece: the way enemies react to how you take down others is implemented so beautifully makes the game feel truly alive during stealth combat…
The Scarecrow sections are some of the highlights that bring me back for a playthrough from time to time. The subtlety of the manipulations get me every time, despite knowing when to expect them, with the slow build of the psychological effect of the fear toxin, and especially *THAT* mindfucking twist!
    It was insane. I was so excited go see what Rocksteady would do with the character in Arkham Knight and then...

Absolutely fuck all. Just generic race tracks, as if the Batmobile didn't already have enough forced content as it is.
        I didn't mind the Riddler races, to me they were a fun diversion from the "generic" point to point driving element, i thought. It was the constant drone battles that i took issue with in AK. While they were fun to begin with, they became a chore as the game went progressed. I had hoped for more strategic elements to the Tank battle modes, along the lines of the several "heavy tank" encounters, though even they seemed to ramp up the difficulty in a way that involved more luck than strategy, more akin to a game of checkers than chess!

I definitely expected more from the fact that scarecrow was back as a protagonist, that side of things definitely fell short of my expectations as soon as i realised the only reason he was doing any of what he was doing, was because batman had let Croc take grab him in the sewers under Arkham Asylum, and he had fallen in with the AK "chip on the shoulder because batman is better than them" crew. And with even just a rudimentary understanding of general Batman lore outside of the Arkham universe, I saw the Arkham Knight reveal coming from a mile off, despite the fact that he had been spruiked as an "original" character. 

Still though, as overly ambitious as the game was, I did have fun with it up to the point of unlocking the "short" version of the true ending, but gave up on the riddler collectibles to youtube the "final definitive directors cut expanded" ending, not long after i had finished the rest of the Most Wanted lists. 

I think the main issue with AK, was that it was a much more sprawling open world than Arkham City, and as a result felt like a lot of the "generic" militia sidequests were more filler than killer, especially the drone fights when disarming the bombs, which became more bullet-hell type gameplay designed to justify more forced time in Tank-mode, rather than intelligently planned Batman incursions utilizing forethought and planning.
Asylum is shorter than the other games in the series and apart from arkham knight feels the best game to replay multiple times. You could argue that it is better than arkham knight is a lot of aspects and I would still agree.
Correct, this trope was originally related to Batman, the Spiderman relations are just a play on it.  I'm not sure Greg Miller was "the first", here's a whole bunch of reviewers who said the same thing some with the same publishing date as the IGN review - https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-game-really-makes-you-feel-like-batman
Riddler trophies in Asylum were pretty straightforward to me. Trophies in City got ridiculous.
    I will say tho, some of the puzzles were a bit too obscure. The ones that involved a question mark that was visible in detective mode were worded in such a way that I spent ages wandering the map searching for an actual puzzle piece (A puzzle has many sides but not all are visible)
        i can hear his voice
            Hi diddle diddle, time for a riddle!
Huh, I for one preferred Asylum to City in most ways.
It's mostly agreed City improved on everything from the first game. +1 on liking the tighter level design of AA better - I loved me the massive Gotham, but it didn't have the same character Asylum had and every once in a while got repetitive since it was way longer. 

AA was just a comic come to life - doesn't overstay its welcome, it's right to the point with top execution (bossfights aside). I'd rate them the same even if City is improved in many ways.
    Yeah that's where Asylum shines over City, the pacing and the atmosphere are unrivalled in that game.
Takes some brainpower to solve them
The quick fire gadgets made combat *much* better. Adding his gadgets into the fights helped you feel resourceful, and the increased enemy variety made it even more important that you're adapting on the fly to the challenges Batman faced.

I personally loved the Cape and gliding mechanics in Arkham City and Arkham knight. They made simply exploring the open world setting that much more enjoyable.

At least Riddler trophies were optional. You didn't need them to finish the game. It's one of the things that taught me I didn't have to 100% everything to enjoy games anymore.
It’s absolutely worth it! The nice thing about firing it up on a whim is that it’s fairly short (maybe 8 hours?), so it’s not a huge time commitment. And you’ll know in the first hour or so if it’s for you.
And friends have given me the weird eye whenever I say this to them. It's like people automatically assume that just because a game is bigger it also means it has to be better by default. And yeah, the sequels aren't bad games at all, but the first game is by far the best of the saga because of how well it is designed in terms of scope and what it was set out to do.
Yeah. I played through Asylum recently and enjoyed it all over again, then continued onto City and immediately recalled why I bounced off that one when it came out. The controlled freedom of Asylum gave better direction for the series instead of just saying "let's fly around a city" and do whatever
Yeah personally I don’t like spreading out content like that, Asylum is tight and condensed and every spot has a purpose/character whereas in City there are entire map sections where nothing is going on, group of 5 enemies on a nondescript sidewalk





Honestly been tired of ‘open-world’ for the sake of it for a hell of a long time now





Wish they kept the games tighter, City loses me every time I give it a try, so much trekking back and forth
I agree. 

Personally I thought Rocksteady refused to evolve the formula enough. They constantly give themselves convenient narrative reasons to have empty open worlds rather than applying their mechanics to a living, breathing city. 

I could forgive it with Arkham City, but there was no excuses for Arkham Knight to once again be the same old "set over one night" routine followed by a convenient city evacuation. You're on (at the time) next gen hardware, and you've finally got to Gotham City. Why wouldn't you have fun with that? How does the Arkham formula work in a living world? How can Bruce Wayne play a part? What sort of dynamic world activities would there be? They could have done so much and took the lazy way out, and they're doing it yet again with Suicide Squad where we've moved from evacuated Gotham to... alien invasion Metropolis. Just once I beg they actually try and make a proper open world.
    If you're thinking of something like Spider-Man PS4 , I really don't think that would work for Bats or the Squad.

Spidey is the kind of guy who would stop and help anyone he comes across that has an issue. That's just the guy he is.

Bats? He's only ever in 3 places: the Batcave, on top of the police roof getting news from Gordon about where he needs to go, and the place where stuff happens. Yeah, he's usually on patrol, but if he gets a call to go to Arkham, he won't stop to help the old lady getting mugged, since a lot more people could get hurt if he doesn't, while Spidey could afford the detour (in part also because of how his villains work).

This goes double for the Squad. Waller wouldn't let them deviate from the mission by even an inch (which makes me curious how the open world would work there), and any civilians would run screaming at the sight of them, so there's no point in having a "proper open world".
        Then just don't do crappy throwaway side tasks like preventing granny muggings. Maybe have them as a random minor event if you're roaming alleys, but rare and not a thing where you have to stop 30 of them for a dumb achievement. Don't do the AssCreed/Skyrim/DA:I thing with a big shallow world full of boring radiant tasks.

Have day sections with Bruce doing socialite mingling/Wayne business meetings as spy/talky missions. You can introduce new characters that way, in well directed story missions like in RDR2. 

At night he can don the suit and do his thing using whatever info he got. Maybe you're investigating something and you see the batsignal light up, so you go have a chat with Gordon and enter a several quest deep side-story that moves along the main plot.

There are much more intriguing ways to do this than another 'random goons in empty city with bosses sometimes'. They just do it because it's easier and they still sell like hotcakes.

I'd agree on Suicide Squad, that game should be more like infiltrator action missions - but Bruce does half the work as himself in many comics/animated episodes/movies, so it would work well in a standard functioning Gotham. 

For example, investigating the Falcones operating a legitimate looking business while hatching some plots wouldn't work if Gotham is just random goon filled again.
            You've got it spot on and some of your examples are exactly the sort of things I wanted from the Arkham games after the first two. 

Rocksteady stuck to their corner rather than branching out, and completely wasted the opportunity of creating a modern open world Gotham City.
            Man, I personally disagree greatly with some of this. I think a city full of a bunch of batman villians to stop is just a lot more interesting than the idea of walking around doing Bruce Wayne stuff. It reminds me of the Spiderman PS4 game where (for me, personally) all the walking around sections as Peter at the feast hall and with MJ and as a scientist were all super dull and by far the worst parts of the game. Like, to me, the Arkham games were some of the very best open worlds, filled with side quests that were actually meaningful because they were stopping all the various villians. And rather than a bunch of random dumb collectibles, they only had one type of collectible, the riddler trophies, which if you don't want to run around doing collectibles, you don't have to, but they atleast had a real storyline reasoning, rather than just existing for no purpose.

The Arkham games and the Assassins Creed games are on complete opposite ends of the open world spectrum in my opinion.
                Leaving the entirely hypothetical idea of BW sections aside, I'd rather never have a Batman game again if it's more of the same. Time for crime solving in a normal populated city. No need to entirely miss the larger point that keeping Gotham empty is a played out concept.
                    I didn't miss the point, I just disagree with the entire premise myself. Anyways, agree to disagree, have a good day.
        > Yeah, he's usually on patrol, but if he gets a call to go to Arkham, he won't stop to help the old lady getting mugged, since a lot more people could get hurt if he doesn't

Huh?  He most definitely would stop the old lady getting mugged.  Source where he did not?
Especially in hindsight how tired open world games have become (at least for me personally). But I guess it was games like the Arkham trilogy that helped continue to push it into that direction. And at least the Arkham worlds felt like they were full of things to do.
for sure. They seem to think that an open world game MUST have like 400hrs of play time. It feels like they wanted a skyrim like batman game. Its nice if there are lots of things to do but don't make the main story line dependent on grinding the same sort of objectives over and over.
    How is the main story line in any of the Arkham games dependent on grinding objectives? All the side quests/riddler trophies have no bearing on the main story.
I do agree that storyline wise the Riddler in City is much more engaging, but I found some of the actual puzzles so annoying rather than just straight up difficult that I think I barely 100%'d it once.
I think, besides combat, Arkham City moved away from Asylum’s strengths. I felt crazy back when it launched and still do now when I hear this, Asylum is a much tighter and better focused game




‘Open world’ is an unnecessary choice more often than not, and Arkham City is a prime example. Spread out everything and water it down
    This “everything was watered down” point of view never made any sense. It takes place in Gotham City. I guarantee you that if the game was more linear, many, many more people would bemoan the fact that it had the potential to let players explore more of Gotham. 

Jumping, grappling, gliding, climbing, swinging across the roofs of Gotham as Batman _and_ Catwoman is worth the price of admission alone. This is without discussing the very _active_ nature of traversal across the open world in AC. There is much to do and much to appreciate at any area of the city. Batman is the protector of Gotham. To criminals, he is never seen but seemingly always watching. Arkham City indulges in and delivers on this fantasy _hard_. The night ramps up in intensity with every single hour and villain introduced. The streets of Gotham steadily filled and replaced by different gangs in different areas of the city, which tells a small narrative of the gang wars going on throughout. These thugs eventually get access to firepower, and your traversal of the city and tactics to approaching areas has to change with the capabilities of your enemies. Next thing you know you’re fighting Ninjas on rooftops. This is probably one of the best pieces of Batman media for its ability to make you, the player micro manage and overcome one of Batman’s most dangerous nights. When I finished Arkham Asylum, one of my first thoughts was “that was awesome! I wonder if they could make that work in a full Gotham City!” 

They pulled that off spectacularly in Arkham City. I’m truly sorry that you can’t see or appreciate that and mark it as just another generic open word. And the “unfocused” argument is doubly perplexing when you remember how many condensed and self contained locales there are featured throughout the main story. The Iceberg Lounge, The City of Wonder and the old subway station are just some examples of self contained areas found throughout the open world that have great level design, featuring many ways to tackle encounters and progress.  

You may not agree with the direction of the game but you cannot deny that it was done masterfully well by the team at rocksteady.
    That's a lot of opinions stated as facts.  Clearly there's 2 schools of thought on this, I personally enjoyed the sequels better and I don't really care for open world games.
Not sure about Asylum, but in City the keyboard was very nice for quickfiring all the different gadgets in combat by double tapping the number keys.

For overall movement I guess a controller is nicer, but I never had issues with kb+m in this series.
I mean… just plug in a controller to finish that part?
Personally, I usually play games that don't require fine aiming with a controller. 

Much more enjoyable that way IMO.
Origins is my favorite
Dun-dun-dun-dun

"Did anyone catch the game last night?"
    DING DONG! Warden Joker Here!
For me, I felt like I never wanted it to stop! Despite there not being all that much to do since the game was linear, I wanted to keep going on even when the game was finished!
    Oh cool! Good for you that there are many more games in the series then :)
It's alot like PS4 Spider-Man in the way that it doesn't insult you by reintroducing all the characters, it respects the player by assuming you know the world.
    Ps4 Spider-Man took a lot from Asylum. That’s fine though, I liked Asylum a lot.
No there are 6  
Asylum  
City  
Origins  
Knight  
Shadow of Mordor  
Shadow of War
    That is a take 

One I can’t entirely oppose
    No! There are 7!

Asylum

City

Origins

Knight

Shadow of Mordor

Shadow of War

Mad Max

:P
        You forgot Sleeping Dogs.
            That game actually has a combo system where it diverts enough to not be included. But yeah, otherwise I would've added it
There are? I bought the Arkham collection years ago and was only 3 games.

I assumed it included all content, but guess not
    A different company made origins so I presume that’s why

Although it’s gameplay is the same and it’s clearly a prologue to the series 

If you haven’t played I highly recommend it, one of the best boss fights in the series, >!deathstroke!<
    You mentioned the Batmobile in the third, that was actually the fourth, Arkham Knight. The bundle may not have included Arkham origins (a prequel, but the third game in the franchise)
        I got a key for origins in exchange for a beta key for hearthstone lol. 

I still can’t believe someone gave me origins for the beta key of a free to play game lol.
            Collector I guess?
    Origins is lovely, I highly recommend it
Some people don't count Origins, that was WB thinking they could cheap out now that the series was established by handing it to an in-house studio instead of hiring Rocksteady.

The X-Men Legends/Marvel UA series suffered the same thing.  Once Ravensoft did all the work building a great series, Activision thought they could cheaply produce more by handing it to a shovelware developer.
    You say that as if Origins wasn't a great game in its own right.
    I wish we could get another quality XML or MUA game. Honestly, the closest spiritual successor we got was Marvel Heroes, but that shut down.
I'm still sad that the multiplayer for origins was shut down so quickly.
    I actually heard that there's a workaround for the PC version. Didn't research enough so I can't quite tell you how it works, but it should be good news for those who really want those damned online-only achievements
        Oh don't even get me started on the online-only achievements lmao.
    there is a way to still play it on pc and there's even a steam group where they regularly play origins multiplayer and finish achievements or just have fun
        That's actually really cool, definitely gonna go bring it up with my friends.
I like Origins. It's just more of City and the only one in the series that I 100%-ed. Knight is the one when gameplay became tedious.
    Agree. Origins gets a lot of criticism, but I still enjoyed it more than Knight.
    Knight was my favorite Arkham game but it was also the first one I played, so Asylum and City felt like egregious downgrades.
I think it’s a great game, it just didn’t do enough different to set it apart from Arkham City. We went from the asylum setting in 1, to a more open world setting in 2 to a similar setting for 3, and the Arkham knight/4 had the car stuff which set it apart. Origins is a solid game but not a unique Arkham game.
    They’re all amazing games to get for $5-$10 each
I didnt even know it existed until another commenter told me lol. I bought the arkham collection and apparently that doesnt include Origins
As someone who 100%ed the other 3, is it really? I always read about the long bridge to go between areas, goofy premise, and changes that were made to encounters/enemies that made it easy for you to lose combo for cheap reasons.
    City is a much better game. Origins was a slog.
The car was badass, but some had a problem with it being included a bit too much especially since a lot of the missions it was necessary. Arkham games usually let you choose different approaches so that felt like a step back to a lot
It differs from person to person. I thought it was great to change the pace. 

Arkham city got kinda repetitive near the end already, so I loved it.
The implementation is solid, and it definitely adds a new dimension to the over all "I'm Batman" feel of the game. It does have a few nifty mechanics such as a mag-boost launch that throws batman sky-high, a winch/grappling-hook that is at first used to brilliant effect for exploration and solving of various Riddler challenges, and the "freeroam" tank mode that offers much more precise maneuverability during the battles with the Militia drones. However, after a certain point, the drone battles become very repetitive, and are a bit of a chore to trudge through as the novelty of the Tank mode wears off in some of the late-game encounters. While not a dealbreaker, the Tank mode doesn't feel as strategic as it should, outside of a few "cat and mouse" type boss encounters. It is definitely a lot of fun blasting around Gotham in the Batmobile though, and the Riddler racetracks (or perhaps "race-tricks?) during the Catwoman "teamup" sections were definitely a highlight for me personally.
    The riddler tracks made no sense to me personally, why was he wanting Batman to race around a track? Was Nigma super into motorsports? There was nothing about those challenges related to wits, just driving, so they felt super out of place.   


The gameplay of them was very fun, it's just weirdly done in the story.
        You do have a point. Though they did at least convey a sense of trickery and deviance that showed concievable traits of the Riddlers personality. Unlike the endless drone tanks thrown out by the Arkham Knight, a man who it seems had every thug, brawler, and mercenary on his payroll, yet the drones only stood as a McGuffin to maintain Batman's "No Kill" policy, which I had a hard time reconciling against the overall ethos that brought about the Militia in the first instance. Surely there was more tactical advantage to be gained by forcing Batman into a hopeless situation by deliberately putting him into a position where he had no choice but to end countless lives to save Gotham. 

Even the Joker never pushed Batman to that point, due to the "Gentleman's Game" between the two of them over the years.
            For sure, the Batmobile was a big disappointment to me for the most part, the drones and the tank mode just felt like they were added to appeal to a wider audience. It's definitely not really fitting with the no killing policy, what if a shot misses and hits a building somewhere? It's also not really Batman's style. He wouldn't bring a tank to fight people. He'd probably find a way to emp the drones on mass or take them down some other way, it just isn't a very batman solution to a problem. Which was unfortunate as so much of that game was awesome, even if it felt shoved aside in favour of the bat tank. Not to mention having the Deathstroke boss battle be basically another tank battle, which also defeated the purpose of specifying all the others were just drones. 

I think in a lot of ways they were unsure where to go past Joker, the whole plot feels a lot less thought out than the previous games.
                The Deathstroke tank battle was just a rehash of the Arkham Knight boss fight, with a couple of extra bodyguard units. I can see Deathstroke in a tank though, as he is the woorld's "best" mercenary, and basically a DC version of Marvel's supersoldier and weapon-x projects. Not to mention that Deathstroke is Batman's equal in combat, as well as the history, and even to a point respect, between the two of them as highly skilled, highly trained combatants. There was the same level of "respect" and rivalry between Batman and Joker, which brought a balance to that whole relationship.

Arkham Knight on the other hand, was never willing to admit that he wasn't an equal, so he threw a tantrum, and went after Joker to prove a point that was doomed to failure from the outset, which Batman knew already before the fact, which is why he didn't want to let him take that path as the outcome was obvious. Joker bent over backwards to prove that point to AK, and then Scarecrow stepped in as his mentor, because he was intelligent, but also not an equal with Batman, and also had a chip on his shoulder because Batman had snubbed him by letting Croc get him. 

Don't forget that a large part of the story of Arkham City was essentially batman trying to save Joker from himself, so when Joker wound up dead, it had the same emotional impact on Batman,as when young Bruce lost his parents in the alleyway. The only reason the Emo Army (TM) was able to seize control of Gotham, was because Batman had lost one of his oldest and closest "friends" when Joker died, which compounded the guilt he felt over not being able to impart any emotional stability onto Jason Todd, which led to Joker assaulting him due to his impulsive teen angst to prove himself. Then throw in the power vaccuum that was left when Joker died, because enemies like Two Face and Penguin no longer had anyone they truly feared.

So we end up with Batman being off the wagon and unprepared for the assault, which is why I cant understand why they were unmanned drones, as having real people in the tanks would have been the smart strategy by AK. It would have also fit the blatantly overt "fuck you, dad" mindset that was driving AK at the time, by forcing Batman to retreat instead of going in as a one man army. Though one man army kind of makes sense when you look at the big picture, as it was Gotham's last stand.

As lazy as the drones were as a McGuffin, Batman was not running at full capacity mentally due to blaming himself for the deaths of both Joker and Jason, and was also spread thin due to the war that the rest of the rogues gallery were waging on Gotham, and then Scarecrow resurfaced bringing his new and improved toxin, which created enough of a diversion for AK to overwhelm what little capacity Gotham PD had to maintain the last remaining scraps of status quo. The overall premise of the story was solid, but it just wasn't implemented as well as it could have been. This was the epic finale of the Arkham saga, so of course it had to play out like a Michael Bay movie, all pyrotechnics and action heroes, bigger and badder than before. 

I honestly think that a lot of the sidequests were just shoehorned in to inflate play time,as were the tank battles, much to the detriment of story pacing. Obviously it couldn't have been anyone other than Batman that brought in Two Face, Penguin, et al, even if that was just going through the motions at this point in the saga. 

I did thoroughly enjoy the Man-Bat and Pyg quests though, as they brought something new to the table, and were quite enjoyable as far as the pacing and lore. Azrael made sense as a tutorial challenge, and didn't drag out too long. The Militia checkpoints and command stations were tolerable, and kind of fit in without being forced, but then there was those damn mines, which was where they were obviously scraping the bottom of the barrel, as that's where the drones were used to artificially extend those encounters. They should have had tank squads just roaming the city from the outset, patrolling like they were during the AK and Deathstroke tank encounters, as that would have made more sense as to where they kept coming from when defusing the bombs, instead of just randomly appearing right on cue, perfectly scripted just to be a pain in the ass.
I liked it but didn't at the same time. Fundamentally it's a fun mechanic that they introduced. But it also felt a little over used and took away from the core loop of a beat-em up game. It's been a while so maybe I'm exaggerating but tank battles and races took up a good third or so of the main story and side quests.

I get why they did it in a way. They'd been putting out Arkham games once every couple of years for quite a while and needed to freshen things up. It just felt a little overdone. But without adding something new then the franchise was kind of coming to a hiatus point where they'd just be churning out the exact same game.

That said it's still a pretty good game. If you're like me and find yourself coming back to the series every once in a while then playing Arkham City is still a bunch of fun. Just maybe not as exceptionally good as the first two titles.

Now that I've been without a batman beatem up game for so long [I really can't wait for the upcoming Suicide Squad game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl0uj3VAO1o)
I didn't like it personally, it made the batman parts of the game feel redundant as so much of the gameplay was shoehorned into the batmobile which is a goddamn tank for some reason, feels like they wanted to make it more actioney for COD fans. The tank gameplay was pretty awful.
You should play the third one. Imo it is the best of the trilogy gameplay wise. The batmobile being a bit repetitive is the only con. Story is kinda predictable but all in all, a REALLY good game.
The Batmoble definitely has its share of haters. I personally enjoyed it and it's not like you have to use it in the open world outside of missions. Gliding around is still as fun as ever
If you were never into Batman, hopefully after playing the game you will be kinda like me. They're amazing, and pretty much the reason I started reading and consuming so much Batman fiction.
    Thanks, will give it a go.
I was kinda meh about superheroes at the time, but really loved those games. It also helps that you don't need to know pretty much anything about the characters beforehand, but if you wish to know, each game has a sort of encyclopedia about them
    Thanks. I probably feel the same about superheroes now as you were back then. I will give it a go.
It was insane. I was so excited go see what Rocksteady would do with the character in Arkham Knight and then...

Absolutely fuck all. Just generic race tracks, as if the Batmobile didn't already have enough forced content as it is.
    I didn't mind the Riddler races, to me they were a fun diversion from the "generic" point to point driving element, i thought. It was the constant drone battles that i took issue with in AK. While they were fun to begin with, they became a chore as the game went progressed. I had hoped for more strategic elements to the Tank battle modes, along the lines of the several "heavy tank" encounters, though even they seemed to ramp up the difficulty in a way that involved more luck than strategy, more akin to a game of checkers than chess!

I definitely expected more from the fact that scarecrow was back as a protagonist, that side of things definitely fell short of my expectations as soon as i realised the only reason he was doing any of what he was doing, was because batman had let Croc take grab him in the sewers under Arkham Asylum, and he had fallen in with the AK "chip on the shoulder because batman is better than them" crew. And with even just a rudimentary understanding of general Batman lore outside of the Arkham universe, I saw the Arkham Knight reveal coming from a mile off, despite the fact that he had been spruiked as an "original" character. 

Still though, as overly ambitious as the game was, I did have fun with it up to the point of unlocking the "short" version of the true ending, but gave up on the riddler collectibles to youtube the "final definitive directors cut expanded" ending, not long after i had finished the rest of the Most Wanted lists. 

I think the main issue with AK, was that it was a much more sprawling open world than Arkham City, and as a result felt like a lot of the "generic" militia sidequests were more filler than killer, especially the drone fights when disarming the bombs, which became more bullet-hell type gameplay designed to justify more forced time in Tank-mode, rather than intelligently planned Batman incursions utilizing forethought and planning.
I will say tho, some of the puzzles were a bit too obscure. The ones that involved a question mark that was visible in detective mode were worded in such a way that I spent ages wandering the map searching for an actual puzzle piece (A puzzle has many sides but not all are visible)

And rather than a bunch of random dumb collectibles, they only had one type of collectible, the riddler trophies, which if you don't want to run around doing collectibles, you don't have to, but they atleast had a real storyline reasoning, rather than just existing for no purpose.

The Arkham games and the Assassins Creed games are on complete opposite ends of the open world spectrum in my opinion.
            Leaving the entirely hypothetical idea of BW sections aside, I'd rather never have a Batman game again if it's more of the same. Time for crime solving in a normal populated city. No need to entirely miss the larger point that keeping Gotham empty is a played out concept.
                I didn't miss the point, I just disagree with the entire premise myself. Anyways, agree to disagree, have a good day.
    > Yeah, he's usually on patrol, but if he gets a call to go to Arkham, he won't stop to help the old lady getting mugged, since a lot more people could get hurt if he doesn't

Huh?  He most definitely would stop the old lady getting mugged.  Source where he did not?
How is the main story line in any of the Arkham games dependent on grinding objectives? All the side quests/riddler trophies have no bearing on the main story.
This “everything was watered down” point of view never made any sense. It takes place in Gotham City. I guarantee you that if the game was more linear, many, many more people would bemoan the fact that it had the potential to let players explore more of Gotham. 

Jumping, grappling, gliding, climbing, swinging across the roofs of Gotham as Batman _and_ Catwoman is worth the price of admission alone. This is without discussing the very _active_ nature of traversal across the open world in AC. There is much to do and much to appreciate at any area of the city. Batman is the protector of Gotham. To criminals, he is never seen but seemingly always watching. Arkham City indulges in and delivers on this fantasy _hard_. The night ramps up in intensity with every single hour and villain introduced. The streets of Gotham steadily filled and replaced by different gangs in different areas of the city, which tells a small narrative of the gang wars going on throughout. These thugs eventually get access to firepower, and your traversal of the city and tactics to approaching areas has to change with the capabilities of your enemies. Next thing you know you’re fighting Ninjas on rooftops. This is probably one of the best pieces of Batman media for its ability to make you, the player micro manage and overcome one of Batman’s most dangerous nights. When I finished Arkham Asylum, one of my first thoughts was “that was awesome! I wonder if they could make that work in a full Gotham City!” 

They pulled that off spectacularly in Arkham City. I’m truly sorry that you can’t see or appreciate that and mark it as just another generic open word. And the “unfocused” argument is doubly perplexing when you remember how many condensed and self contained locales there are featured throughout the main story. The Iceberg Lounge, The City of Wonder and the old subway station are just some examples of self contained areas found throughout the open world that have great level design, featuring many ways to tackle encounters and progress.  

You may not agree with the direction of the game but you cannot deny that it was done masterfully well by the team at rocksteady.
That's a lot of opinions stated as facts.  Clearly there's 2 schools of thought on this, I personally enjoyed the sequels better and I don't really care for open world games.
DING DONG! Warden Joker Here!
Oh cool! Good for you that there are many more games in the series then :)
Ps4 Spider-Man took a lot from Asylum. That’s fine though, I liked Asylum a lot.
That is a take 

One I can’t entirely oppose
No! There are 7!

Asylum

City

Origins

Knight

Shadow of Mordor

Shadow of War

Mad Max

:P
    You forgot Sleeping Dogs.
        That game actually has a combo system where it diverts enough to not be included. But yeah, otherwise I would've added it
A different company made origins so I presume that’s why

Although it’s gameplay is the same and it’s clearly a prologue to the series 

If you haven’t played I highly recommend it, one of the best boss fights in the series, >!deathstroke!<
You mentioned the Batmobile in the third, that was actually the fourth, Arkham Knight. The bundle may not have included Arkham origins (a prequel, but the third game in the franchise)
    I got a key for origins in exchange for a beta key for hearthstone lol. 

I still can’t believe someone gave me origins for the beta key of a free to play game lol.
        Collector I guess?
Origins is lovely, I highly recommend it
You say that as if Origins wasn't a great game in its own right.
I wish we could get another quality XML or MUA game. Honestly, the closest spiritual successor we got was Marvel Heroes, but that shut down.
I actually heard that there's a workaround for the PC version. Didn't research enough so I can't quite tell you how it works, but it should be good news for those who really want those damned online-only achievements
    Oh don't even get me started on the online-only achievements lmao.
there is a way to still play it on pc and there's even a steam group where they regularly play origins multiplayer and finish achievements or just have fun
    That's actually really cool, definitely gonna go bring it up with my friends.
Agree. Origins gets a lot of criticism, but I still enjoyed it more than Knight.
Knight was my favorite Arkham game but it was also the first one I played, so Asylum and City felt like egregious downgrades.
They’re all amazing games to get for $5-$10 each
City is a much better game. Origins was a slog.
The riddler tracks made no sense to me personally, why was he wanting Batman to race around a track? Was Nigma super into motorsports? There was nothing about those challenges related to wits, just driving, so they felt super out of place.   


The gameplay of them was very fun, it's just weirdly done in the story.
    You do have a point. Though they did at least convey a sense of trickery and deviance that showed concievable traits of the Riddlers personality. Unlike the endless drone tanks thrown out by the Arkham Knight, a man who it seems had every thug, brawler, and mercenary on his payroll, yet the drones only stood as a McGuffin to maintain Batman's "No Kill" policy, which I had a hard time reconciling against the overall ethos that brought about the Militia in the first instance. Surely there was more tactical advantage to be gained by forcing Batman into a hopeless situation by deliberately putting him into a position where he had no choice but to end countless lives to save Gotham. 

Even the Joker never pushed Batman to that point, due to the "Gentleman's Game" between the two of them over the years.
        For sure, the Batmobile was a big disappointment to me for the most part, the drones and the tank mode just felt like they were added to appeal to a wider audience. It's definitely not really fitting with the no killing policy, what if a shot misses and hits a building somewhere? It's also not really Batman's style. He wouldn't bring a tank to fight people. He'd probably find a way to emp the drones on mass or take them down some other way, it just isn't a very batman solution to a problem. Which was unfortunate as so much of that game was awesome, even if it felt shoved aside in favour of the bat tank. Not to mention having the Deathstroke boss battle be basically another tank battle, which also defeated the purpose of specifying all the others were just drones. 

I think in a lot of ways they were unsure where to go past Joker, the whole plot feels a lot less thought out than the previous games.
            The Deathstroke tank battle was just a rehash of the Arkham Knight boss fight, with a couple of extra bodyguard units. I can see Deathstroke in a tank though, as he is the woorld's "best" mercenary, and basically a DC version of Marvel's supersoldier and weapon-x projects. Not to mention that Deathstroke is Batman's equal in combat, as well as the history, and even to a point respect, between the two of them as highly skilled, highly trained combatants. There was the same level of "respect" and rivalry between Batman and Joker, which brought a balance to that whole relationship.

Arkham Knight on the other hand, was never willing to admit that he wasn't an equal, so he threw a tantrum, and went after Joker to prove a point that was doomed to failure from the outset, which Batman knew already before the fact, which is why he didn't want to let him take that path as the outcome was obvious. Joker bent over backwards to prove that point to AK, and then Scarecrow stepped in as his mentor, because he was intelligent, but also not an equal with Batman, and also had a chip on his shoulder because Batman had snubbed him by letting Croc get him. 

Don't forget that a large part of the story of Arkham City was essentially batman trying to save Joker from himself, so when Joker wound up dead, it had the same emotional impact on Batman,as when young Bruce lost his parents in the alleyway. The only reason the Emo Army (TM) was able to seize control of Gotham, was because Batman had lost one of his oldest and closest "friends" when Joker died, which compounded the guilt he felt over not being able to impart any emotional stability onto Jason Todd, which led to Joker assaulting him due to his impulsive teen angst to prove himself. Then throw in the power vaccuum that was left when Joker died, because enemies like Two Face and Penguin no longer had anyone they truly feared.

So we end up with Batman being off the wagon and unprepared for the assault, which is why I cant understand why they were unmanned drones, as having real people in the tanks would have been the smart strategy by AK. It would have also fit the blatantly overt "fuck you, dad" mindset that was driving AK at the time, by forcing Batman to retreat instead of going in as a one man army. Though one man army kind of makes sense when you look at the big picture, as it was Gotham's last stand.

As lazy as the drones were as a McGuffin, Batman was not running at full capacity mentally due to blaming himself for the deaths of both Joker and Jason, and was also spread thin due to the war that the rest of the rogues gallery were waging on Gotham, and then Scarecrow resurfaced bringing his new and improved toxin, which created enough of a diversion for AK to overwhelm what little capacity Gotham PD had to maintain the last remaining scraps of status quo. The overall premise of the story was solid, but it just wasn't implemented as well as it could have been. This was the epic finale of the Arkham saga, so of course it had to play out like a Michael Bay movie, all pyrotechnics and action heroes, bigger and badder than before. 

I honestly think that a lot of the sidequests were just shoehorned in to inflate play time,as were the tank battles, much to the detriment of story pacing. Obviously it couldn't have been anyone other than Batman that brought in Two Face, Penguin, et al, even if that was just going through the motions at this point in the saga. 

I did thoroughly enjoy the Man-Bat and Pyg quests though, as they brought something new to the table, and were quite enjoyable as far as the pacing and lore. Azrael made sense as a tutorial challenge, and didn't drag out too long. The Militia checkpoints and command stations were tolerable, and kind of fit in without being forced, but then there was those damn mines, which was where they were obviously scraping the bottom of the barrel, as that's where the drones were used to artificially extend those encounters. They should have had tank squads just roaming the city from the outset, patrolling like they were during the AK and Deathstroke tank encounters, as that would have made more sense as to where they kept coming from when defusing the bombs, instead of just randomly appearing right on cue, perfectly scripted just to be a pain in the ass.
Thanks, will give it a go.
Thanks. I probably feel the same about superheroes now as you were back then. I will give it a go.
I didn't mind the Riddler races, to me they were a fun diversion from the "generic" point to point driving element, i thought. It was the constant drone battles that i took issue with in AK. While they were fun to begin with, they became a chore as the game went progressed. I had hoped for more strategic elements to the Tank battle modes, along the lines of the several "heavy tank" encounters, though even they seemed to ramp up the difficulty in a way that involved more luck than strategy, more akin to a game of checkers than chess!

I definitely expected more from the fact that scarecrow was back as a protagonist, that side of things definitely fell short of my expectations as soon as i realised the only reason he was doing any of what he was doing, was because batman had let Croc take grab him in the sewers under Arkham Asylum, and he had fallen in with the AK "chip on the shoulder because batman is better than them" crew. And with even just a rudimentary understanding of general Batman lore outside of the Arkham universe, I saw the Arkham Knight reveal coming from a mile off, despite the fact that he had been spruiked as an "original" character. 

Still though, as overly ambitious as the game was, I did have fun with it up to the point of unlocking the "short" version of the true ending, but gave up on the riddler collectibles to youtube the "final definitive directors cut expanded" ending, not long after i had finished the rest of the Most Wanted lists. 

I think the main issue with AK, was that it was a much more sprawling open world than Arkham City, and as a result felt like a lot of the "generic" militia sidequests were more filler than killer, especially the drone fights when disarming the bombs, which became more bullet-hell type gameplay designed to justify more forced time in Tank-mode, rather than intelligently planned Batman incursions utilizing forethought and planning.
i can hear his voice
    Hi diddle diddle, time for a riddle!
Then just don't do crappy throwaway side tasks like preventing granny muggings. Maybe have them as a random minor event if you're roaming alleys, but rare and not a thing where you have to stop 30 of them for a dumb achievement. Don't do the AssCreed/Skyrim/DA:I thing with a big shallow world full of boring radiant tasks.

Have day sections with Bruce doing socialite mingling/Wayne business meetings as spy/talky missions. You can introduce new characters that way, in well directed story missions like in RDR2. 

At night he can don the suit and do his thing using whatever info he got. Maybe you're investigating something and you see the batsignal light up, so you go have a chat with Gordon and enter a several quest deep side-story that moves along the main plot.

There are much more intriguing ways to do this than another 'random goons in empty city with bosses sometimes'. They just do it because it's easier and they still sell like hotcakes.

I'd agree on Suicide Squad, that game should be more like infiltrator action missions - but Bruce does half the work as himself in many comics/animated episodes/movies, so it would work well in a standard functioning Gotham. 

For example, investigating the Falcones operating a legitimate looking business while hatching some plots wouldn't work if Gotham is just random goon filled again.
    You've got it spot on and some of your examples are exactly the sort of things I wanted from the Arkham games after the first two. 

Rocksteady stuck to their corner rather than branching out, and completely wasted the opportunity of creating a modern open world Gotham City.
    Man, I personally disagree greatly with some of this. I think a city full of a bunch of batman villians to stop is just a lot more interesting than the idea of walking around doing Bruce Wayne stuff. It reminds me of the Spiderman PS4 game where (for me, personally) all the walking around sections as Peter at the feast hall and with MJ and as a scientist were all super dull and by far the worst parts of the game.

I did thoroughly enjoy the Man-Bat and Pyg quests though, as they brought something new to the table, and were quite enjoyable as far as the pacing and lore. Azrael made sense as a tutorial challenge, and didn't drag out too long. The Militia checkpoints and command stations were tolerable, and kind of fit in without being forced, but then there was those damn mines, which was where they were obviously scraping the bottom of the barrel, as that's where the drones were used to artificially extend those encounters. They should have had tank squads just roaming the city from the outset, patrolling like they were during the AK and Deathstroke tank encounters, as that would have made more sense as to where they kept coming from when defusing the bombs, instead of just randomly appearing right on cue, perfectly scripted just to be a pain in the ass.
I didn't miss the point, I just disagree with the entire premise myself. Anyways, agree to disagree, have a good day.
