[[What are some cool lesser known facts from the Arkham lore Spoilers probably]]


I’ve completed all of the games in the series multiple times, but I’m by no means an expert. I just found out recently about Jason Todd’s time in Arkham Asylum from reading Arkham Knight Genesis. Are there any other cool stories or lore that somebody might not pick up from the surface level of just playing the game? Please share your knowledge with me, I love learning about the Arkham universe and its secrets. 


The lunatics that attack you in Arkham Asylum were once more normal patients who were experimented on by Hugo Strange and The Mad Hatter as an attempt to create a mind control device that were eventually used to create the Tyger Soldiers.
    Is that in the character files or recordings in City? 
        Yeah in the files in Arkham City somewhere...
            That’s awesome I’ll have to go back and take another listen. I knew that the Tyger guards were like lobotomized, but I didn’t know the inmates at Arkham were early test subjects. 
During the black gate riot in Arkham origins, Johnathon crane aka scarecrow was in the prison. There is a check in and check out list and he hasn't checked out at the time of the riot.
    Like he was working there as a doctor pre super criminal days?
        I like to think it was him using inmates as test subjects before he went full on super villain
            Wow that actually is pretty cool, I haven’t seen that one before. I guess that means his time as a super villain was relatively short before the events of Asylum. 
        Yeah, and possibly testing his fear chemicals on the inmates.
My favorite bit of trivia in City is that you initially see Penguin and think that he's wearing a monocle, but in the stories it's revealed that it's actually part of a beer bottle permanently lodged in his head. 

My favorite bit of lore in the series is in Origins, it's revealed in Warden Joseph's second audio file that he's going to Judge Harkness' Christmas Party. If you talk to Calendar Man in Arkham City on Christmas he'll recall how he strangled Judge Harkness with a string of Christmas lights at that very party. Calendar Man's cell in Origins also has Judge Harkness scribbled on the wall. This is an easter egg in Origins based off an even more obscure easter egg from City. Plus the whole affair is Joker's fault since he stopped Calendar Man from being gassed.
    I'm not sure the penguin thing really counts as an Easter egg. It's very clear from the beginning of the game that it's a beer bottle on his eye, especially considering it is surrounded by scars and it goes into his face. But the Judge Harkness one is pretty cool, never noticed that before.
You might already know this but it's heavily implied that Kirk Langstrom's wife Francine becomes She-Bat.
    I actually did find this one out recently, never saw any reason to go back to his lab after the game but I saw it in a YouTube video. Pretty cool. 
That Assualt on Arkham is an animated film sequel to arkham origins. You can definetly tell because the locations in the film look live they've done it perfect to how they look in the game
    That and the trailer says it’s in the same universe
    That movie has several call-backs to Arkham Origins:

Joker recognizes Deadshot and references that they worked together once. (Technically Joker and Deadshot worked together TWICE before this, once in Arkham Origins and again in Origins-Blackgate HD)

The Arkham Origins BatWing is used in this movie to transport Batman from Arkham Asylum to Gotham to catch up with the Joker and Deadshot

The Glue Grenade is seen briefly when Batman confronts Bane, you can see Batman throw it at Banes head and use a detonator to activate it.

During the scene in which the Suicide Squad is looking through the inventory room in Arkham Asylum, King Shark notes that he's never heard of Firefly, This sounds about right considering that Firefly has (so far according to a comment made by one of the firefighters in Arkham Knight) only attacked Gotham City once (during the events of Arkham Origins)

During Batman's fight against the Suicide Squad, while fighting King Shark, you can see Batman use some sort of Electric Fist Gauntlets similar to the Shock Gloves he used in Arkham Origins. It can be assumed that he used the Shock Gloves technology to develop these gauntlet's before giving the Shock Gloves to the GCPD. Unfortunately, one of these Gauntlet's is destroyed by King Shark during the fight.
    TIL there is a movie called this. Off to watch it now!
    I would have thought this was common knowledge. That's like saying 'Arkham Knight is a sequel to Arkham City' as a cool fact. I don't recall any locations looking similar though. It didn't feel like the Arkham universe at all
The whole subplot from Origins about Cyrus Pinkney is creepy.
    I thought the crypt was really cool even though it was so random where it was placed 
    I liked the Cyrus Pinkney stuff since they not only unlock an interesting story but also give you lore about the history of some of the buildings in Gotham. My only problem with the Pinkney pages and Anarky tags is that you could go through the whole game having no idea that you could collect them and the only place the game tells you about them are in the loading screens.
        > My only problem with the Pinkney pages and Anarky tags is that you could go through the whole game having no idea that you could collect them

That's one of the coolest things about them. A normal player wouldn't even register them as a thing. Makes it even better
            This is the first I've heard of it
Before the events of Arkham knight, after kidnapping and making Batman fight Solomon Grundy every day for a week, calendar man poisoned a few hundred people and held a baby hostage. The GCPD, Batman, and surprisingly, Azrael helped get the poisoned to a hospital. Calendar man still had the baby, but scarecrow confronted him and told him to lay off, because he wanted Batman saved for his plan with the knight and the militia. After being promised by scarecrow that he would be there for Batman’s end, Calendar man reluctantly complies and drops the baby off a hill intentionally so Batman would eject out of the batmobile and catch it. (which he did) This event led directly into scarecrow ordering the militia to invade Gotham.

On Penguin's ship in Arkham Origins, in the gun sales room there is a sheet with little tabs you can pull off from Dr Jonathan Crane offering cash in exchange for subjects to test certain 'medicines' on (likely early experiments with fear drugs)
    Scarecrow was all over the place in these games, he has a lot of Easter eggs 
        I never found it myself but I was told in City if you go into a certain place you can find a dead joker goon tied to a chair with a note written in blood saying 

“you’re next

Scarecrow”
Asylum has a bio for Hush yet Batman doesn’t meet him until City
In a lower floor of Oracle's clock tower you can find a chat log with Oracle talking to huntress 
Is that in the character files or recordings in City? 
    Yeah in the files in Arkham City somewhere...
