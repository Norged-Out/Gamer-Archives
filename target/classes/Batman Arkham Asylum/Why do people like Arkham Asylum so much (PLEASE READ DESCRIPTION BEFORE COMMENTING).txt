[[Why do people like Arkham Asylum so much (PLEASE READ DESCRIPTION BEFORE COMMENTING)]]


So do I think Arkham Asylum is a bad game? No, I think it’s fine but in my personal opinion I think the story is bland and generic and obviously because it’s the first game in the series the combat isn’t great either. One thing I will acknowledge is that the Atmosphere for the game is great. But I don’t understand how some people think this game is the best in the series (check the poll that was posted to this subreddit). I don’t think the game is horrible and I don’t have a problem if you think it’s the best in the series I just want to know what I’m missing


*Edit*

So I’m adding this because I’m seeing a lot of the same reasons being put that I neglected to acknowledge in my initial response.

Yes I know that this was the first in the series and I knew that going into the series. I also have very fond memories of the game and if you like a game because of the memories that’s obviously fine, but I do not.  

In my opinion I think it’s fair to compare Asylum  to the other games in the series, considering the poll I mentioned is also comparing each game in the series. All of the games are very very similar now yes gameplay does get better with time but that doesn’t mean Asylums combat is objectively bad. I also think it’s fair because the argument “well it’s an older game so it’s not fair to compare them all” but for me at least, Arkham city is better then every game in the series.

And one more time I understand that nostalgia can be a big factor for liking a game, and there’s no problem with liking a game for that reason.

That’s it


Alot of it is nostalgia, when asylum came out it was easily the best superhero game ever (atleast off the top of my head), let alone batman game.

And the game was clearly made with alot of love, sure while the story isn't particularly special the way they brought every character to life was amazing. Mark Hamil is the best animated joker by a longshot and the design for scarecrow was probably the coolest hes ever looked. 

Sure it hasn't aged the best but I'd argue it still holds up pretty well and just the fact that its batman makes it more interesting then alot of the stuff around even today.
    Again I think the game is good I was just looking for other reasons for people saying it’s the best game in the series apart from nostalgia. (I don’t have a problem with people saying Asylum is the best one in the series because of nostalgia I just wanted to see if I was missing something)
        The only thing I can think of is that is more linear and thus more focused then the other open world games. 

Other then that I think objectively it's not as good as the other games with the exception of origins (which isnt bad, i just prefer the main games)

It's one of those "you had to be there" to enjoy it as much as people did/do
I am one of those people. Yes, the atmosphere is perfect and honestly the best one in the series. Yes, the story is linear and simplistic but this is where its charm lies. It feels like a very long episode of TAS. Also the combat, albeit slower than in the other games, is still fun. This game has the best and toughest stealth sections of the series. But probably my most favourite thing about Asylum is the pacing. It is literal perfection. It gradually introduces its areas and features, it always finds a way to make each encounter and location feel unique. This is how games should be paced.
    Not to mention the combat system being quite different from the later games, with certain mechanics being removed such as the throw mechanic, make it a joy to try and master the combat each time you come back to the game.
    It's the worst game but only because the controls aren't good.
Like you said, the atmosphere is a huge point for many people, but the “linear” aspect of the game streamlines the narrative and keeps everything on track, so to speak.

There’s a lot more to do in City and Knight, sure, but the side quests never feel truly feel connected to the overall narrative and don’t really impact it in any particular way. 

In Asylum you can buy that all of that story is taking place in one night, and that Batman is running the gauntlet in an all-nighter from hell.


To me, since it was the first in the series, it had way more freedom creatively and could really experiment with gameplay and deviate from the Batman most are accustomed to. 

It wasn’t trying to be a “Blockbuster Triple A” game. It was focused on being the best Batman game it could be. Not that the other games aren’t, but keep in mind, most Batman games before were either based on a movie or tv show.

This game was a love-letter to the COMICS, and “A Serious House on Serious Earth” in particular. 

I like Arkham Origins, but it’s a very by the numbers Batman game, and I feel if that was the first game in the series that the franchise would not be as big as it is.

Like others have said, context is important, and when this game came out it blew the doors off of the superhero genre in games.

It’s a combination of respect for the source material, innovations in its combat and stealth gameplay, it’s mixture of action and horror, and overall attention to detail that put it leagues above any other superhero game at the time, and still hangs with the best of em today.

Is it perfect? No. 

But to this day Asylum remains my favorite. 
Just like how “Batman: The Animated Series” is the definitive version of Batman for a lot of people, “Asylum” is the definitive Batman game to me.
It’s the first and paved the way for the rest of the series, and so gets a lot of credit. Context is important when reviewing any piece of media, from games to movies to art, and taking away the context of Asylum as the progenitor of this great series is a bit unfair for criticism imo.
    Yeah, the context of the time is important, if you want to put your opinion on a game you have to consider the time it was released, we don't have legendary classics(Sonic, Mario World, Ocarina, FF7) for no reason, they were all groundbreaking at the time, but go back to them now, they will have glaring problems. I think the best way to put is not that old classics are bad now, but that they aged poorly, some worse than others, and it is fine if someone doesn't like them even if they consider the context.
    As I said K don’t think it’s a bad game I just think that it’s strange that it’s peoples favorite game in the series I think It was a great game to pave the way to other Arkham games I just feel like it doesn’t do anything special, it doesn’t have enough of its own personality apart from being the first one
    Why is it unfair to discount context? I don't care about the game's context. I care if it's fun. And for me, Asylum is substantially less fun and substantially worse than the other 3 games. I don't think it deserves brownie points just because it was a game changer.
        Well thats your opinion, I and a lot of other ppl on this sub think that the story and the boss fights, characters and map are incredible. Yes, it was a game changer and the nostalgia factor is large, but that isn't the only reason why people like it.
            I will strongly disagree about the map and boss fights being incredible. But even if they are, can you honestly say they are better than in the other 3 games?
                Yes, I can. I was disappointed by the boss fights in Knight, so boss fights wise, Asylum beats Knight imo, even though I absolutely love Knight.  And I love the Asylum map, I think it was much more focused than the other maps because of the focus on the storyline rather than the side missions.
                    Interesting. For me, I absolutely despise the Asylum map and atmosphere. The buildings are very confusing, especially Intensive Treatment, and I hated climbing through those confusing messes of empty buildings to collect riddler trophies. And I can't agree at all about the Knight boss fights being disappointing, especially compared to Asylum. Riddler, Pyg, and Two-Face alone are better than Scarecrow, Croc, and Ivy, and I would rather fight ten Deathstroke tanks than another damn Asylum Titan.
                        Wow I guess it just comes down to personal opinions huh? Yours is definitely different than mine but everyone has their own opinions lol :)
                            It's fine that you and other people like it. 

But the comment I responded to said that we need to take context into account when evaluating the game, and discounting context is unfair. This is a point that I strongly disagree with. I think we should evaluate a game on whether we find it fun, regardless of context. For me, I speedrun these four games, and each time I speedrun Asylum, I have substantially less fun with it than with the other 3 games. The context of when Asylum was made doesn't change that.

Another (probably better) example is Assassin's Creed 1. That was the first AC game, and it was the progenitor of the series of great games that followed it. It's also boring, repetitive, and clunky, and the context doesn't change that.
                                I dont disagree, however, I think the comment you replied to did have a point about context. Asylum was the first batman game to be truly 100% BATMAN. And I have to disagree on Intensive Treatment, maybe its the amount of times I've played the game but I don't have an issue running through Intensive Treatment.

Also its hard to judge Asylum if you're speedrunning it imo- i think dedicating to the story and appreciating it in full truly does Asylum justice. Knight may have had really fun side missions, and a great story, but Asylum just has something that the other games don't have enough of imo. I cant really specify what that is, but imo Asylum is special.

Also I think context isn't needed and its not necessarily unfair to discount it, but at the same time it is nice to take it into consideration.
I would agree with you about the game not being the best in the trilogy, however I would defend its title because it did come out in 2009 and, for the time, was an amazing game. However, I would have to disagree with you on the story being bland, I quite enjoy it and I think its a good mix between problem solving and action.
I will keep it 110% with you I don’t hate Arkham asylum but I also don’t like it. I only played it through 100% 4 times. It’s just after the story THERES not much to do just riddler and that’s it
    That’s exactly how I feel I also don’t hate it but I feel it’s a little lacking (TBF it is this first game but I digress)
I like how it feels like a horror game without trying to be scary and it feels like playing an old batman cartoon that does the characters justice. Also for me it has the most fun riddles,  easter eggs, and details of all the games.
It was just one of those games that you can't truly appreciate unless you played it when it came out. Asylum changed the idea of what superhero games could be. There was nothing else like it at the time.

Also outside of Batman, without Asylum laying a strong foundation of narrative, gameplay and world building, we wouldn't have games like Spider-Man PS4. It laid the path for a lot of things.

Asylum is just very special, even though it's not my favorite out of the series. The fact that it still holds up and is enjoyable over a decade later is just proof of that.
A lot of it probably has to do with nostalgia. It is the shortest Arkham game and the very first one that ever came out, so chances are high that it is the one that many people replayed more often than the others. I, for example, had a phase before Arkham City came out, where I played Arkham Asylum every weekend, including all the optional Riddler stuff.

Then you have the villains. If you're a Batman fan who mainly enjoys the classic villains, you'll certainly love Arkham Asylum's cast because it mainly consists of A-list villains, except for Zsasz.

Another point is the atmosphere. A huge part of the amazing atmosphere of the entire series comes from the great design of Gotham, so if Arkham Asylum includes one or more of your favorite settings/locations in the series (or the Asylum as a whole is your favorite location), that will also positively affect your enjoyment of the game. For example, I think that the Botanical Gardens are one of the best settings ever visited throughout the series and I always look forward to seeing it again whenever I replay the series.

Some people might also enjoy the combat a bit more. Personally, I prefer the combat from the later games because it's occasionally more challenging and it gives you so many more different moves and possibilities to build up diversive combos. On the opposite, however, Arkham Asylum's combat is much more grounded and realistic and I can imagine that this is more appealing to some people.

And speaking of people who feel this "open world fatigue", the fact that Arkham Asylum has a much more linear story with almost no sidemissions might also be a reason for why some people consider it the best in the series.
agreed the atmosphere is amazing but everything else to me is nowhere near as good as knight or city
The man
Totally agree. My least favourite game in the series
A but late to the party but I love arkham asylum not because it's yhe best game ever made. I simply love it because rocksteady portrayed batman the best I have ever seen especially when compared to the Snyder films it's a real shame what rocksteady did to batman in suicide squad kill the justice league but that's a different story. I have always been a batman fan since I was a kid. Much like spiderman I have always felt that anyone can be batman and batman beyond helped with that. The reason I love batman in a whole more than any other superhero other than spiderman isn't because he has powers it's the exact opposite. I'm gonna say my favorite quote in all of superhero stuff. "Anyone can wear the mask"- Stan Lee with all these other heros you will never even dream about being them or them being real but with batman...he's as close as we can get. And sure like I said asylum isn't the greatest game to ever exist. But to some of us...it's more than a game. Kevin was more or less... a hero r.i.p
Imo arkham asylum was given the best because till then there was nothing to compare it with thats why most consider it the best

City had the best sotrytelling 

Knight has the best gameplay edit:(refined)

Origins had the best bossfights

Asylum was our first and had no competition
Asylum has terrible combat not the worst gameplay ever but the worst in the series also it has something other Arkham games don’t have a perfect atmosphere Arkham asylum has the best atmosphere out of all the games its the darkest batman arkham game yet the story is one of the best also and characters graphics are stunning for a 2000s game it was something different from other superhero games at the time yeah oh and the boss fights were fun the killed croc one was one of the best in the series and the open world is great makes collectible finding fun And Arkham asylum joker was easily one of the best throughout the other games
Lets see if i can contribute something. Yes, nostalgia has a big part in it. Yes, it was a ground-breaking game in terms of combat mechanics and overall staetics. Yes, the story is somewhat great, but you have to start somewhere. Yes, the voice-acting was superb because... Conroy/Hamill, nuff said. Yes, it was the best batman game ever (Dark Tomorrow, anyone?). Where was i going with this...? Ok. What you are missing is the fact that it was a game-changer (pun intended) in the industry. As all old games, nowadays they dont whistand the passage of time, but this one remains playable. It is an "Icon", just as Mario, Sonic, Tomb Rider, Mortal Combat, etc. Compare it with the other arkhams and they only added more, but kept the essence of the game (gadgets, puzzles, combat mechanics, etc) look at it this way, is like a fine wine. Its not the best, but it is still playable.
I get that the story is bland and generic but it takes a lot of inspiration from the Arkham Asylum comic written by Grant Morrison (that's at least what I think). The comic and the game can be both seen as one contained story where Batman is forced to encounter the many villains that he himself imprisoned. As the story progresses, the world around him feels obscured and rather demented. Batman has to face his inner demons while trying solve a multitude of catastrophes along the way. 
I applaud the game's horror like approach to everything. It made it more thrilling and creepy, which was something new for superhero games at the time. 

Some of the fight mechanics, gadgets etc. were pretty rough but in comparison to Batman Begins PS2 (also a good game), Asylum is pretty solid.
Highlights a lot of his detective tools which weren't used in other games, very dark atmosphere
That was always my POV until I realized I played them in the wrong order. I played origins first bc as a dumb kid I thought “Hmmm, this one says Origins, so it must be the first game”. So when I played Asylum after, I thought it was much worse. Then later realizing I played them out of order helped me appreciate Asylum more, knowing that it was the first game and that’s why it felt clunkier and unpolished. But nostalgia is a hell of a drug, which is why I like Origins the best, bc it’s the first Batman game I played so it’s special to me.
I like *Asylum* the best because it's the darkest in the series. The whole game takes place in the Asylum. *City*, *Origins*, and *Knight* all have "safe" locations away from criminals. Plus, it's the first in the series. What *City* did better is through the music. If *Origins* had a better ending than just >!beating up Joker who stands there and does nothing!<, *Origins* would've been my favorite. The detective analysis was fun, but I wish the cases weren't all the same way- >!scan the body, then retrace the crime scene, find another clue, now that that's done, apprehend the suspect.!< As for Knight, I got it on Epic Games, but the save data doesn't remain if I uninstall. Plus, there are some characters in that game I didn't like, such as Deathstroke being limited to >!a tank fight!<. 

As for *Blackgate*, I'm about to play it once I 100% *Origins,* which I'm trying to quickly do.
    I loved the origins ending. It’s a perfect end to a Batman game. Punching joker in the face
        There's no such thing as perfect. The closest would be he no longer needs to be Batman. If you actually believe what you say, you probably like Tarantino.
            You are Nitpicking. Origins has a story focused on Batman’s first encounter with bane and joker. What’s wrong with ending the game beating them up? Knight was made to end a saga, him stopping being batman is a decent ending, but I prefer the origins one more. In asylum you fight monster joker which sucked. In city (which is my favourite ending) joker dies, which is awesome but it’s a cutscene. The actual fight is just clay face. Origins however has you actually stop the joker yourself. It’s not ment to be challenging, that was the bane fight, it’s just meant to have you defeat joker.

Beating up joker in a church is a perfect ending to a Batman prequel. I felt like Batman. That’s the point of the series
                You say I'm nitpicking, but you ignore my whole response and focus solely on thug Batman. Also, watching spit leave Joker's mouth about three times because of the beatdown was gratuitous. *Arkham Knight* offered a couple of different endings, I think that is better. But again, there is nothing perfect in this world, especially violence, regardless of location.
                    Once again, nitpick. Spit leaving someone’s mouth is a really weird thing to criticize. Also Obviously nothing is perfect, however, we use the word perfect to describe something that is really good all the time. In my opinion origins has a better ending than knight. I’m not ignoring knights ending, it’s decent, but it feels undeserved due to the mediocre story.
                        The person who addresses the message from the other person is labelled as nitpicking? You should look up what the word means. 

As for the rest of your response, you just proved you nitpicked. I wasn't criticizing solely spit, I said it occurring about three times was gratuitous. It could be someone getting their head blown off, could be f-bombs, etc., the point that you ignored or didn't recognize is in excessiveness, something can be damaging.
                            How am I nitpicking... by addressing your nitpick?
                                Again, you missed the point. Are you obsessed with the word and using it against people?
                                    What?
Its alot of nostalgia. The game was world wrecking at the time. But I agree they have improved alot with the latest entries. And no lie combat in that game is spotty at best
1. It was the first installment of the Batman: Arkham franchise.
2. The location of where the game takes place is outside of the batcave and wayne manor probably the most iconic location in Gotham.
3. The dark eerie atmosphere.
4. The story.
5. The villains.

You see...I look at Arkham Asylum as it was the best when it came out. I don't compare the later games to Asylum because it wouldn't be fair. I don't know how to explain it other than of course later games would have improved game play mechanics, etc.
For me the biggest thing is the nostalgia which im sure is the same for most other people.

I always have fond memories of playing it with my brother and getting stuck on the stealth sections so he had to help.
But the thing that really makes the game for me nowadays is how scary I find it. No matter how many times i play it it manages to freak me out.
I also like the story because of how ridiculous it is (even though it can be a little bland at times.) 
It feels like it takes itself less serious than the other games and has more of that comic book absurdity that makes it so awesome to play. A giant titan infused joker battle on the top of a building with helicopters circling around? Sign me up.
I also think rocksteady used the somewhat limited space of the island masterfully, with bits getting closed off and changing as the game progresses and new enemies appearing after certain bossfights.

I love this game, I always have despite its flaws.
Simply enough, the story is amazing. Pacing is great and the combat is slower than other games but still awesome. Harley Quinn and the Joker are probably some of my all time favorite Batman characters and I adore the way they were portrayed in Asylum. Also, the atmosphere and map of the Asylum as the game map is in my opinion one of the better ones out of the franchise.
    Also, Scarecrow was awesome, and the Fear Toxin Nightmare missions were super fun. Overall the "villains" and boss fights in Asylum were overall extremely entertaining.
Much tighter design setting it in one place. Up until Knight i found the other two baggy and exhausting.
It is imo undoubtedly the weakest in the series. 

I grew up on origins and Arkham city and only got to play asylum through rentals. I’ve played through it about twice since then but I still have never really been attached to it. 

For me personally, I find it doesn’t have the replay value the other games have. I’m about to play through the Arkham series again and I really can’t bring myself to go through Asylum once again, so I’ll likely start with origins and move to city. 

It works as a game and for its time I think it was very good, but after playing it more than once you really have no reason to not avoid it and play city as it is the more complete experience. 

I could be wrong in some people’s eyes but this just comes from personal experience. I do appreciate and enjoy the game from time to time, I just am not really fond of it.
Where's the man jokes
Again I think the game is good I was just looking for other reasons for people saying it’s the best game in the series apart from nostalgia. (I don’t have a problem with people saying Asylum is the best one in the series because of nostalgia I just wanted to see if I was missing something)
    The only thing I can think of is that is more linear and thus more focused then the other open world games.

It's the worst game but only because the controls aren't good.
Yeah, the context of the time is important, if you want to put your opinion on a game you have to consider the time it was released, we don't have legendary classics(Sonic, Mario World, Ocarina, FF7) for no reason, they were all groundbreaking at the time, but go back to them now, they will have glaring problems. I think the best way to put is not that old classics are bad now, but that they aged poorly, some worse than others, and it is fine if someone doesn't like them even if they consider the context.
As I said K don’t think it’s a bad game I just think that it’s strange that it’s peoples favorite game in the series I think It was a great game to pave the way to other Arkham games I just feel like it doesn’t do anything special, it doesn’t have enough of its own personality apart from being the first one

And I love the Asylum map, I think it was much more focused than the other maps because of the focus on the storyline rather than the side missions.
            Interesting. For me, I absolutely despise the Asylum map and atmosphere. The buildings are very confusing, especially Intensive Treatment, and I hated climbing through those confusing messes of empty buildings to collect riddler trophies. And I can't agree at all about the Knight boss fights being disappointing, especially compared to Asylum. Riddler, Pyg, and Two-Face alone are better than Scarecrow, Croc, and Ivy, and I would rather fight ten Deathstroke tanks than another damn Asylum Titan.
                Wow I guess it just comes down to personal opinions huh? Yours is definitely different than mine but everyone has their own opinions lol :)
                    It's fine that you and other people like it. 

But the comment I responded to said that we need to take context into account when evaluating the game, and discounting context is unfair. This is a point that I strongly disagree with. I think we should evaluate a game on whether we find it fun, regardless of context. For me, I speedrun these four games, and each time I speedrun Asylum, I have substantially less fun with it than with the other 3 games. The context of when Asylum was made doesn't change that.

Another (probably better) example is Assassin's Creed 1. That was the first AC game, and it was the progenitor of the series of great games that followed it. It's also boring, repetitive, and clunky, and the context doesn't change that.
                        I dont disagree, however, I think the comment you replied to did have a point about context. Asylum was the first batman game to be truly 100% BATMAN. And I have to disagree on Intensive Treatment, maybe its the amount of times I've played the game but I don't have an issue running through Intensive Treatment.

Also its hard to judge Asylum if you're speedrunning it imo- i think dedicating to the story and appreciating it in full truly does Asylum justice. Knight may have had really fun side missions, and a great story, but Asylum just has something that the other games don't have enough of imo. I cant really specify what that is, but imo Asylum is special.

Also I think context isn't needed and its not necessarily unfair to discount it, but at the same time it is nice to take it into consideration.
There's no such thing as perfect. The closest would be he no longer needs to be Batman. If you actually believe what you say, you probably like Tarantino.
    You are Nitpicking. Origins has a story focused on Batman’s first encounter with bane and joker. What’s wrong with ending the game beating them up? Knight was made to end a saga, him stopping being batman is a decent ending, but I prefer the origins one more. In asylum you fight monster joker which sucked. In city (which is my favourite ending) joker dies, which is awesome but it’s a cutscene. The actual fight is just clay face. Origins however has you actually stop the joker yourself. It’s not ment to be challenging, that was the bane fight, it’s just meant to have you defeat joker.

Beating up joker in a church is a perfect ending to a Batman prequel. I felt like Batman. That’s the point of the series
        You say I'm nitpicking, but you ignore my whole response and focus solely on thug Batman. Also, watching spit leave Joker's mouth about three times because of the beatdown was gratuitous. *Arkham Knight* offered a couple of different endings, I think that is better. But again, there is nothing perfect in this world, especially violence, regardless of location.
            Once again, nitpick. Spit leaving someone’s mouth is a really weird thing to criticize. Also Obviously nothing is perfect, however, we use the word perfect to describe something that is really good all the time. In my opinion origins has a better ending than knight. I’m not ignoring knights ending, it’s decent, but it feels undeserved due to the mediocre story.
                The person who addresses the message from the other person is labelled as nitpicking? You should look up what the word means. 

As for the rest of your response, you just proved you nitpicked. I wasn't criticizing solely spit, I said it occurring about three times was gratuitous. It could be someone getting their head blown off, could be f-bombs, etc., the point that you ignored or didn't recognize is in excessiveness, something can be damaging.
                    How am I nitpicking... by addressing your nitpick?
                        Again, you missed the point. Are you obsessed with the word and using it against people?
                            What?
