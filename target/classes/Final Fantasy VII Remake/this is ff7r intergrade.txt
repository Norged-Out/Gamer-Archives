[[this is ff7r intergrade]]


and intermission is the yuffie dlc?

just transferred over my save file from ps4, ready to finally climb that shinra tower! totally confused on there being a seperate store page for ff7r intergrade and what i'm looking at.

i've been reading reddit posts and just need some clarification before i boot this adventure up...

so... 

ff7r intermission is the yuffie dlc.

ff7r on ps5 is ff7r intergrade just isn't labeled that.

ff7r intergrade's store page is ff7r ps5 and intermission in a bundle.

my apologies for the phone photo instead of a screenshot and reposting a question that was likely answered already. ðŸ˜…


Intergrade is simply the PS5 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake. It is the one you have installed in your pic, and is identifiable by the "PS5" tag.

Intermission is the DLC featuring Yuffie.
    SE made this so needlessly complicated
        Right? Stupid trendy naming system made me Google it too.
    perfect. thank you.
tldr; just clarifying this is the best ps5 version of ff7r to play. people say intergrade is the updated version but this doesn't say intergrade.
    If you load the game, can you press R2 (I think it was R2) to move the Menu over to the Yuffie DLC?

Im 99% positive my Ps5 Intergrade just lists itself as remake on the home menu
        i can see the yuffie dlc from the main menu ingame. so that should mean i'm good?
            Yep!  im fairly positive that means you are good.
Intergrade is just the name for the PS5 version. Since there's the PS5 label in front of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE it's Intergrade.
Intergrade is just the PS5 version, it's a bit confusing. You're good
Intergrade is just the name of the bundle of the PS5 Version of the Remake and the Yuffie DLC Intermission.
The PS5 version of the remake doesn't have a special name. People still are mixing all of this up.
I looked up this question last night to make sure Iâ€™d be getting both summons with the Rebirth pre-order and this thread confirmed what I found as well.
