[[Intergrade Ending Sector 7 Skybox]]





Can someone light my lantern as to what the problem exactly is here?
    The plate above is Sector 6's plate but the ground level is supposed to be the ruined Sector 7. So it should have the collapsed Sector 7's plate.
        Got railed for saying this after Remake. You can see the same at the end of Remake -- the plate's still up.
    The scene is the people of sector 7 cleaning up the rubble from the fallen plate. But when they look up they are under sector 6, and sector 7 is still in the air.

The direction of the areas are also flipped, if you look in the same direction as Marle in game you'd face the central pillar, as well as the Seventh Heaven sign is broken less than it is earlier in the game, in fact it matches 1 to 1 with how it gets broke prior to plate fall.
        So.... isn't a possible conclusion that Cloud and Co stopped the Turks from triggering platefall at the end of Chapter 12 in this "timeline"? How else would Biggs even survive?
            That was actually my first theory upon completing the game, with Zack being the main reason though, but the fact that the continuity of them being in the sector 7 slums but under sector 6 and facing the wrong direction is off really does raise some major questions with that theory being something that simple.
                I have seen a similar issue where you see the particular skybox (sector 6) every time you are in the slums. When you go through sector 5 with Aerith and look up, it is also the sector 6 skybox that appears. 

Why would this discredit a "no platefall" approach?

Isn't this a more general technical issue ? Skyboxes in general were very static.
                    >When you go through sector 5 with Aerith and look up, it is also the sector 6 skybox that appears. 

That's an in game issue, where the sky box fails to rotate with the player correctly.

The ending was pre rendered which means technical issues shouldn't be a part of it, as they can skew things exactly to how they want them before recording.

>Why would this discredit a "no platefall" approach?

It's more it discredits its simply just another timeline with no platefall.
                        >That's an in game issue, where the sky box fails to rotate with the player correctly.

No. The skybox is a static image, not a 3D environment. It can't "rotate" to have a different plate above you as you move. There's no loading screens between Sector 5 and Sector 6, so there's no time to change to a different skybox. However, they could have just put in one of those fixed camera crouching sections or something between the sectors and changed the skybox at that point.
                    If you watch the 2019 trailers (the TGS one if I'm not mistaken) The skybox is correct when you meet Rude, you can even see Sector 6's skybox next to Sector 5's
                        That was also an early version running on a developers PC, any number of things could have gone wrong to offset that between then and when the compiled the gold build.
            It’s possible, but then you realise shinra’s could just send another wave within the hour, it really was a no win scenario for sector 7
Sad that this isn't fixed, especially given that it seems like most if not all of the major graphical problems have been fixed, (like the Edge of Creation skybox.)

That being said, some people acting like this is a deal breaker are being a bit over dramatic.
    Part 2 is going to come out and make no mention of the plate not falling in this or any other alternate timeline and people will be mad about that too
    It is not the end of the world and it doesn’t ruin the game. But it is a noticeable flaw that should have been fixed, and deserves to be called out.
        Agreed, but there are some people who are making this out to be way worse than it really is.
    Weird you're not assuming this is deliberate. The developers aren't stupid. Things are different because Zack survived.
        True, but there's still destruction, so I'd assume the plate fell.
            Look up the chapter where you rescue Marlene as Aerith -- there's a ton of destruction there already even before the plate fell.
    they break the immersion though, and there are quite a few of them
[removed]
    I wished Chapter 13 never existed lol. You would think they would pay more attention to the bigger details of their most developed game.
    Or....that was done deliberately. The plate never fell in the ending. Things are different.
        [removed]
            Not sure I follow. The plate being up in the ending is after destroying the Whispers and saving Zack (and anything else that may have been altered), and time is different.
                [removed]
                    Would assume Chapter 13 takes place toward the edge of the plate, while Chapter 15 shows the full extent of damage. You don't walk that far in Chapter 13.

Generally speaking the game's scale is tough to gauge. Going from plate to plate would be much quicker toward the pillar than away. But they didn't go very far into the wreckage in Chapter 13.
What about the skybox in chapter 8? Is it still wrong as well?
    Not sure, got it from YouTube. But I have a bad feeling it's not gonna be fixed... :(
        Yea time to manage expectation :(
    They did not fixed the Sector 5 skybox… I think it’s done on purpose to differentiate sector 7 and 5.
    yes it is still wrong...
Oh, SE. I'm not angry, just disappointed.
Oh my god NOOOOOO :(
Still using the Sector 6’s Plate Skybox… Is it design choice? Or alternate timeline?

This might also means they might not fix the collapse surrounding in Chapter 13 that doesn't look like Chapter 15.
    I'm still sticking with it being a design choice, it was pre rendered in the PS4 version, asset errors are very unlikely to come into play when you are turning it into a video file.

My theory is still the whole game takes place in the lifestream (time being made up within the lifestream through the collective memories of those who have died) and what we are seeing is the effect of Sephiroth affecting those collective memories when he had control of the harbinger.
        ...or Zack survived and changed things.
    Nahh i thing it means they are indeed in sector 6 and that sector 7 didn't fall
        If sector 7 didn’t fall, then why are they cleaning up sector 7 debris…in sector 6?
            I really don't know what is Square trying to pull here... It's not that hard to show an empty plate rather than reusing Sector 6's
                This is a deliberate story choice. It's not a mistake.
            Can't really answer that, maybe in some cuts they are in sector 7 others in sector 6 serving food, because even if it didn't fall maybe they are re moving to sector 6.
But in my opinion this, in the ending with all that gold dust in the air, is only cloud mind re-editing what happened and saying to himself that everything is all right. The same way his mind rewrote the nibelhein incident.
He wants to believe that Zack survived, that he carried him to midgar, that the plate didn't fall...and this leads to these inconsistencies
            There was still a battle. Go back to the chapter where the plate fell, and everything's on fire. Helicopters crashed. Seventh Heaven was damaged during that encounter but platefall was prevented. The obvious angle would be Zack.
        I’m convinced they are standing in sector 7 and it’s the skybox that is (still) an error. All the buildings and details of environment are identical to what we can see in sector 7 in other chapters post plate collapse. I made a thread looking at the details so feel free to check that out and see if it changes your mind.

https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/jfohzs/ogremake_spoilers_clearing_up_some_details_of_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
            It's pretty obvious this was a deliberate choice by the developers and is a hint as to where the story goes from here.
                I did think that initially too, since the camera angle and everything seemed set up to show it in a subtle way. But having checked out the details it doesn’t add up so now I’m sure it’s just an error. However, if my post didn’t convince you there’s nothing else to say.
                    They have in multiple interviews noted how the ending used to be much more slimmed down, and then toward the end of development they got excited and layered in a bunch of hints as to how the story changes from here. They were very deliberate about what they chose to include, and this scene is choreographed precisely to show you the skybox.

The likelihood this is an error is vanishingly small given how platefall is one of the pinnacle events of the entire game. Most of the things people gripe about are related to hardware limitations (textures, etc.) -- and even the PS5 can't play this game with full 4K textures at 60 FPS (hopefully we get a PC version someday). 

The desire for this to be an error seems to stem more from a desire for the game not to be making a radical departure than anything else. What they're showing us in this scene is the group, post-Whispers, standing in Sector 6 looking at an intact Sector 7. Whether this means the plate structure/numbering was rotated around, another sector was destroyed, or Sector 7 was saved, we don't know. But to say they made an error in a very deliberate scene is a heck of a leap of logic.
                        Your first sentence kind of justifies how this seemingly huge error could have been made in the final moments of production. Too many people having input, struggling to meet deadlines etc. As unlikely as it is (and I originally thought), this appears to be what happened. I hate to plug my own thread all the time but did you see my analysis of those scenes? Marle and co. are definitely not standing in Sector 6 - they are standing in Sector 7. You can revisit those same areas, walk down the path that the children run down. Everything is identical; from the buildings, the layout, the debris, canisters lying around, everything exactly as it was post plate collapse in chapters 13 and 14. It’s not just reused assets, it’s the same exact location and you can stand there in game and check for yourself. The only thing out of place is the skybox, which is not consistent with what is seen elsewhere in the game (and the orientation of skybox and the pillar are also 180 degrees out of phase with how the buildings are oriented).

My post if you haven’t seen it already:

Edit: I do agree that people tend to favour theories that are in line with what they want the Remake series to be, even if the evidence contradicts it. All I can say is this is not the case for me. My theory for what’s going on changed about 4 times in the first month after release of Part 1, then a couple of times after that, including when I did this analysis for myself. And the scenes in Intermission also have me reconsidering everything yet again. I’m not set on any particular theory, I am just changing my view as more evidence is laid out and analysis done on it.
                            I read your post, and your analysis is sound. 

I don't disagree that there's something fishy going on with the skybox -- I just think it's intentional, and they're telling us something about how things are different post-whisper battle.

The entire scene is set up for a deliberate pan up to show the plates. But we'll see when Part 2 comes around (maybe)!
            Not gonna say no. But as I said bellow I do believe these scenes aren't even real, so if it is messed up it still makes sense in my theory :)
            >All the buildings and details of environment are identical to what we can see in sector 7 in other chapters post plate collapse

That's not actually true though, the hole to Deepground isn't there, and the Seventh Heaven sign is the one pre plate fall (after getting damaged by the helicopter that falls). 

Also the whole area is rotated completely differently.
                I looked at it pretty closely and think that the hole to Deepground is out of shot in those scenes, not necessarily absent. I addressed the other points in the post.
                    >Deepground is out of shot in those scenes, not necessarily absent.

I think if it was there that little girl would be chatting with Weiss right now.
        I hope you're right...
    It's obviously deliberate. People were VERY vocal about this. Highly unlikely it's a mistake.

What do we think? Still an 'error'? Surely they would have corrected it for Intergrade?
    You can see my comment above, it's absolutely a design decision imo.
        I'm still in that court too. I think it's more logical to assume the re-used **minor** S7 assets around this cutscene are to save time and to depict S6 using non-noticeable re-use.

The skybox is the **major** asset in the scene, what I would call a landmark. To use the S6 skybox here has to be by choice and not error. They had the perfect skybox ready to use from the 'day midgar stood still' chapter etc. Also the panning of the camera is a 'reveal' motion, meaning what we pan up to is something of importance, which only makes sense if its the S6 skybox showing that S7 is still standing.
            >Also the panning of the camera is a 'reveal' motion, meaning what we pan up to is something of importance, which only makes sense if its the S6 skybox showing that S7 is still standing.

Exactly, I think this is what a lot of people miss. This the same game where when Cloud sees Jenovaroth for the first time he immediately grabs his left arm, the arm he  is afflicted with Geostigma in AC, its a ridiculously tiny detail yet they still included it. These guys understand what they want to show, in fact directing cutscenes is their bread and butter.
    Yes, still an error. They'll fix it one day, after they've already sold us three other versions of 7R. They don't care and it keeps fans talking about the game, I mean look at this thread. 

Why would there be S7 debris in S6 if the plate didn't fall?

Edit: my views have changed based on new information.
        I would buy it though haha...  


Maybe a day one patch would fix it... I'm being sarcastic here..
        Its a case of 2 conflicting errors. Either the rubble is an error/corner cut, or the skybox is an error.

I lean towards the former and specifically a 'corner cut' because I see the S7 rubble as minor assets, i.e. things you wouldn't notice/connect unless you looked back and compared closely. Its likely they reused this to create a liveable S6 slum environment.

Whereas the S6 skybox is a major asset/landmark, especially with the panning scene it is the main thing you notice in this scene; like instantly you go 'huh? That's S7 standing?'

The corner-cut doesn't apply to S6 skybox either because they had the perfect skybox from the day midgar stood still chapter they could have used.

So its either a massive faux pas by SE with the skybox or an understandable re-use of minor assets.

Considering its the final cutscenes and its not corrected in Intergrade I have to go with the latter.
            Like I said, it creates more discussion around a game that's already been out for a year. This topic has been discussed *daily* since the game released. They won't fix it until the whole story is complete.
            I retract my previous statement. It's intentional. There's a purgatory in the lifestream that is visualized according to the memories of those lost souls. They all have memories prior to the plate falling so that purgatory Midgar looks the way it did prior to their death. We see things from the perspective of the dead
                Are you referring to the fact that in 'On a way to a smile' Aeris mentions the existence of souls who haven't come to terms with their death yet still existing in the lifestream.

So you're saying that manifests with them being in some sort of half-way realm which looks just like reality except looking how they remember it?

That is an amazing theory if so. That would explain ALOT, eg the church looks different because its how Zack remembers it. It could even explain the different styling of Midgar in Zack's gold dust scene, perhaps this is the way Zack remembers Midgar (as a fortress etc). I wonder if then the gold dust represents the transition to death or waking in this half-way realm? It would mean Biggs hasn't accepted his death either, perhaps the Jessie glove is a representation that she has and has already moved on.

Only thing it doesn't quite explain is Marle, as far as we know she survived the plate drop, so not sure why she'd be seeing the half-way realm S7.

But I like this idea, rather than a different timeline, its just a realm where the souls haven't accepted their fate yet. 

Tbh this could also explain something else; there's something not right with all the people in the church in Zack's intergrade scene. They don't look like S7 survivors to me; they're acting too weird. More than half the people look dazed and in stupor, the rest look confused/upset. If they've all recently just awoken there in this half-way realm then their behaviour would make sense.
                    u/IISuperSlothII how much of this aligns with your thoughts? \^\^\^\^
                        It's close in idea but I have a few differences.

The whole of Remake is Clouds memory in the lifestream (besides Zacks scenes) being corrupted by Sephiroth, so everyone we meet besides Red XIII and Marlene is already dead, its just Clouds memory of them.

Zacks scenes are his memory in the lifestream being corrupted by Sephiroth, so all the different details like Midgar and Stamp are his memory.

The ending of both games then presents a different area, close to what November is describing, a manifestation of the planets collective memory where the conscious of those not yet dissipated into the lifestream exist, but its been changed due to Sephiroths influence with the harbinger. Zacks scene is a part of that.

I'm still 50/50 on the last part, the end of Remake might be Clouds memory having been messed up, while the end of intermission is Zacks consciousness in the lifestream wondering the planet like Elmyras husband.

Who'd have thought a year ago its November who's theories I most line up with haha, although I think it was he who made the memory theory which got me to look at things from a different perspective.
                            Yeah I think the 'whole of remake is Cloud's memory' is the hardest for me to get on board with. It removes all jeopardy from the story if you get me? And it also would be a completely new concept, reliving your entire life in the lifestream/your memories.

I think I much prefer that remake is a physical reality in which there is real jeopardy to the planet and the Zack scenes are him in a bit of a Sixth Sense phase (like many others following the S7 plate drop).

Telling the story of Zack and these others in this half-way state could culminate in Aeris joining them and us seeing the events of 'on a way to a smile' in the game. Eg culminating in all these lost souls finally accepting their fate and coming together at the end to help Holy defeat Meteor.
                                >It removes all jeopardy from the story if you get me? And it also would be a completely new concept, reliving your entire life in the lifestream/your memories.

I've actually tweaked my theory on that. I'm now with the idea that Sephiroth has simply just corrupted their memories.

When a person dies their consciousness continues in the lifestream for a small amount of time before return to the planet, we know that to be true, within the consciousness is the memory, when a person becomes one with the planet their memory is retained while their consciousness is lost, this means they are separate entities to the planet, and messing with memory is Jenova 101.

I actually think it makes more sense Sephiroth would try to win from inside the lifestream having consistently failed on the surface.
                                    Yeah but how would it play out that Sephiroth messing with Cloud's memories in the lifestream would result in him 'winning' and physically controlling the entire planet and its lifestream? That's the jeopardy I'm missing in the theory.

I think for storytelling purposes there has to be a *simple* jeopardy at play. Sounds a bit too convoluted at the moment to be the main purpose of remake if you get me? Eg its alot easier to understand 'Seph's fucking with the past to have another bite at the cherry' than 'he's messing with Cloud's memories that actually for some reason magically gives him an 'in' at controlling the entire planet'.

Unless of course Gaia exists on a physical cycle/loop of life that replays exactly each time but this 'replaying of exact events' is fulfilled through use of the lifestream's past memories. So by tampering with key memories Sephiroth is effectively orchestrating the next cycle to be different. The whispers would then represent soul's who's memories are getting affected/split/out of sync due to the changes, hence why they're fight to keep things on track - because to them thats how it should be. I'd even go as far as saying the whisper that saved Barret's life would then perhaps be Barret's soul himself.

My only issue with any physical cycle/loop of life on Gaia theory is regarding the 'coming of Jenova'. She is outside of the control of Gaia, so when the loop is reset, Her body would no longer be waiting for Shinra to find as we kill it during the course of FF7. So either the entire universe is on a loop which sounds a bit farfetched for this, or its a time loop. Eg the Planet itself has invoked a Time-travel based loop itself, which cycles back physical reality on Gaia back to a point *after* Jenova fell. Eg < 2000 years ago.

Which actually now considering it could the case right? We know that the Cetra found a way to contain/trap Jenova but the details are never confirmed. I wonder if this containment/trap is actually to introduce a 2000-2500 year time loop. I know this has already been thought up but the missing part is the mechanics of it (and how events play out identical each time). We're saying this is through the lifestreams memory. So in a way this aligns with alot of the principles of your theory, that Sephiroth is tainting Cloud's memories, orchestrating the next cycle (which is remake). This would at least put the physical world in jeopardy and also explain/align with the presence and mechanic of the Harbinger, which for all intents and purposes seems to be time-steward related. I wonder if it's the Harbinger himself who is responsible for enacting the reset each time too. So by destroying him we've undone the creation of any future loops. It remains to be seen if it's killed all the whispers though. If they are soul's with conflicting memories then they may indeed continue to appear as we continue to go off course compared to OG.

Going off on a tangent, it makes me wonder, if indeed 'altering memories' is the way to effect future cycles then this potentially adds more importance to the Edge of Creation scene. "7 seconds til the end" for Cloud to do something. What if Cloud decided to alter his memory to Zack surviving? Cinematically Zack's survival scene is shown straight after edge of creation scene. It always felt that this was linked. But then this is back to 'Zack surviving timeline' theories... urgh really wish we had more info to at least have an idea of where this was going
                    Yeah that's what I'm rolling with, it seems so likely at this point. I can't take all the credit because I really derived it from Supersloth. As for Marle. yeah she seems like an inconsistency but I think that what's going on is that they're showing us a cross over between life and death.

 What I mean is the gold dust gives us, the player, a view of the real world with elements of the purgatory. So we see the survivors in the slums, like Marle, but we also see the purgatory elements like the plate as long as the dust is present. It's like visualized memories, Marle looks up at where the plate was remembering it's presence so that's what we see.

Edit: It also lines up with parts of FFX's Farplane concept and the Farplane itself was created based on unused concepts from FF7. So it looks like 7R will be adapting some of the cut material from the OG into it.
                        Ah okay, so as the gold dust falls it acts as a curtain that gives us a temporary look at into this twilight realm. I could buy that.

Telling the story of Zack and these others in this half-way state could culminate in Aeris joining them (after her passing) and us seeing the events of 'on a way to a smile' happen in the game. Eg Aeris trying to help all these lost souls finally accepting their fate and coming together at the end to help Holy defeat Meteor. That would be a remake that truly factors in all compilation and supporting material.
                            It works and fits in really well. It could be just like FF2's Dawn of Souls chapter and I could totally see that being either a DLC or sequel to Crisis Core on it's own.
                                Just thinking about this a bit further, it doesn't need to be far detached from the multiple realities/science-led theories either. Are you familiar with 'Schrodingers cat'?

I wonder if this half-way realm is actually a big mistake/error? So rather than this always being what happens to lost souls who need to find their way to merging with the lifestream, instead what we did with the Harbinger in the Singularity created a Schrodingers cat paradox. So just like the cat in that example Zack is both alive and dead at the same time. Depending how this is implemented it could also be the case for all people who died thanks to whisper involvement between the time of Zack's Last Stand to the end of Remake. Potentially explaining the groggy/stupified people in the church.

This could be Nomura's way of explaining why Zack - who lets be honest, pretty much accepted his death happily in all the tellings of his last stand - Ended up not becoming one with the planet and maintaining his sentiency right up to Advent Children, and possibly beyond. Even at the end of AC it's not confirmed whether he finally dissolves into the lifestream or not.

So it's not multiple 'timelines', it is potentially a singularity/paradox event that creates this shadow realm where those who died due to whisper actions are reborn but not on the same plane of existence as the rest of humanity.
                                    Yes, I agree. A lot of what was considered evidence of multiple timelines applies here. I think this purgatory/singularity I an effect of Sephiroth halting the flow of souls returning to the planet. Like a pocket death universe where he's storing up souls to become a god. Much like the way Shinra uses souls to make electricity Sephiroth wants to use them to achieve his goals of eternal memory/ existence.

If Zack remains in purgatory he can't diffuse into the lifestream, and if he can't diffuse into the lifestream his memories of Sephiroth will live on into eternity. Same if Sephiroth were successful in killing Cloud, he'd be trapped in Sephiroths purgatory.
        This is a ridiculous take. It is very obviously a design choice and hint regarding the future story.
            Sure, ok.
    It was never an error.
Wow holy shit👀
Even after reading the explanations I still didn’t really notice this as a problem. There’s no way that sector 7 inhabitants would be able to handle cleaning up the megatons of debris by hand... that was the only flaw I saw. It should have still had a whole plate of rubble and burning metal everywhere. You shouldn’t be able to see the streets. The fact that the seventh Heaven sign is on the ground suggests that the plate did fall still at the end even after fate was defeated. I am not seeing where the plate did not fall. This the whole skybox issue puzzles me.
This was not an error in Remake, and it remains not an error here. This is a deliberate design choice.
Different timeline

The plate above is Sector 6's plate but the ground level is supposed to be the ruined Sector 7. So it should have the collapsed Sector 7's plate.
    Got railed for saying this after Remake. You can see the same at the end of Remake -- the plate's still up.
The scene is the people of sector 7 cleaning up the rubble from the fallen plate. But when they look up they are under sector 6, and sector 7 is still in the air.

The direction of the areas are also flipped, if you look in the same direction as Marle in game you'd face the central pillar, as well as the Seventh Heaven sign is broken less than it is earlier in the game, in fact it matches 1 to 1 with how it gets broke prior to plate fall.
    So.... isn't a possible conclusion that Cloud and Co stopped the Turks from triggering platefall at the end of Chapter 12 in this "timeline"? How else would Biggs even survive?
        That was actually my first theory upon completing the game, with Zack being the main reason though, but the fact that the continuity of them being in the sector 7 slums but under sector 6 and facing the wrong direction is off really does raise some major questions with that theory being something that simple.
            I have seen a similar issue where you see the particular skybox (sector 6) every time you are in the slums. When you go through sector 5 with Aerith and look up, it is also the sector 6 skybox that appears. 

Why would this discredit a "no platefall" approach?

Isn't this a more general technical issue ? Skyboxes in general were very static.
                >When you go through sector 5 with Aerith and look up, it is also the sector 6 skybox that appears. 

That's an in game issue, where the sky box fails to rotate with the player correctly.

The ending was pre rendered which means technical issues shouldn't be a part of it, as they can skew things exactly to how they want them before recording.

>Why would this discredit a "no platefall" approach?

It's more it discredits its simply just another timeline with no platefall.
                    >That's an in game issue, where the sky box fails to rotate with the player correctly.

No. The skybox is a static image, not a 3D environment. It can't "rotate" to have a different plate above you as you move. There's no loading screens between Sector 5 and Sector 6, so there's no time to change to a different skybox. However, they could have just put in one of those fixed camera crouching sections or something between the sectors and changed the skybox at that point.
                If you watch the 2019 trailers (the TGS one if I'm not mistaken) The skybox is correct when you meet Rude, you can even see Sector 6's skybox next to Sector 5's
                    That was also an early version running on a developers PC, any number of things could have gone wrong to offset that between then and when the compiled the gold build.
        It’s possible, but then you realise shinra’s could just send another wave within the hour, it really was a no win scenario for sector 7
Part 2 is going to come out and make no mention of the plate not falling in this or any other alternate timeline and people will be mad about that too
It is not the end of the world and it doesn’t ruin the game. But it is a noticeable flaw that should have been fixed, and deserves to be called out.
    Agreed, but there are some people who are making this out to be way worse than it really is.
Weird you're not assuming this is deliberate. The developers aren't stupid. Things are different because Zack survived.
    True, but there's still destruction, so I'd assume the plate fell.
        Look up the chapter where you rescue Marlene as Aerith -- there's a ton of destruction there already even before the plate fell.
they break the immersion though, and there are quite a few of them
I wished Chapter 13 never existed lol. You would think they would pay more attention to the bigger details of their most developed game.
Or....that was done deliberately. The plate never fell in the ending. Things are different.
    [removed]
        Not sure I follow. The plate being up in the ending is after destroying the Whispers and saving Zack (and anything else that may have been altered), and time is different.
            [removed]
                Would assume Chapter 13 takes place toward the edge of the plate, while Chapter 15 shows the full extent of damage. You don't walk that far in Chapter 13.

Generally speaking the game's scale is tough to gauge. Going from plate to plate would be much quicker toward the pillar than away. But they didn't go very far into the wreckage in Chapter 13.
Not sure, got it from YouTube. But I have a bad feeling it's not gonna be fixed... :(
    Yea time to manage expectation :(
They did not fixed the Sector 5 skybox… I think it’s done on purpose to differentiate sector 7 and 5.
yes it is still wrong...
I'm still sticking with it being a design choice, it was pre rendered in the PS4 version, asset errors are very unlikely to come into play when you are turning it into a video file.

My theory is still the whole game takes place in the lifestream (time being made up within the lifestream through the collective memories of those who have died) and what we are seeing is the effect of Sephiroth affecting those collective memories when he had control of the harbinger.
    ...or Zack survived and changed things.
Nahh i thing it means they are indeed in sector 6 and that sector 7 didn't fall
    If sector 7 didn’t fall, then why are they cleaning up sector 7 debris…in sector 6?
        I really don't know what is Square trying to pull here... It's not that hard to show an empty plate rather than reusing Sector 6's
            This is a deliberate story choice. It's not a mistake.
        Can't really answer that, maybe in some cuts they are in sector 7 others in sector 6 serving food, because even if it didn't fall maybe they are re moving to sector 6.
But in my opinion this, in the ending with all that gold dust in the air, is only cloud mind re-editing what happened and saying to himself that everything is all right. The same way his mind rewrote the nibelhein incident.
He wants to believe that Zack survived, that he carried him to midgar, that the plate didn't fall...and this leads to these inconsistencies
        There was still a battle. Go back to the chapter where the plate fell, and everything's on fire. Helicopters crashed. Seventh Heaven was damaged during that encounter but platefall was prevented. The obvious angle would be Zack.
    I’m convinced they are standing in sector 7 and it’s the skybox that is (still) an error. All the buildings and details of environment are identical to what we can see in sector 7 in other chapters post plate collapse. I made a thread looking at the details so feel free to check that out and see if it changes your mind.

        It's pretty obvious this was a deliberate choice by the developers and is a hint as to where the story goes from here.
            I did think that initially too, since the camera angle and everything seemed set up to show it in a subtle way. But having checked out the details it doesn’t add up so now I’m sure it’s just an error. However, if my post didn’t convince you there’s nothing else to say.
                They have in multiple interviews noted how the ending used to be much more slimmed down, and then toward the end of development they got excited and layered in a bunch of hints as to how the story changes from here. They were very deliberate about what they chose to include, and this scene is choreographed precisely to show you the skybox.

The likelihood this is an error is vanishingly small given how platefall is one of the pinnacle events of the entire game. Most of the things people gripe about are related to hardware limitations (textures, etc.) -- and even the PS5 can't play this game with full 4K textures at 60 FPS (hopefully we get a PC version someday). 

The desire for this to be an error seems to stem more from a desire for the game not to be making a radical departure than anything else. What they're showing us in this scene is the group, post-Whispers, standing in Sector 6 looking at an intact Sector 7. Whether this means the plate structure/numbering was rotated around, another sector was destroyed, or Sector 7 was saved, we don't know. But to say they made an error in a very deliberate scene is a heck of a leap of logic.
                    Your first sentence kind of justifies how this seemingly huge error could have been made in the final moments of production. Too many people having input, struggling to meet deadlines etc. As unlikely as it is (and I originally thought), this appears to be what happened. I hate to plug my own thread all the time but did you see my analysis of those scenes? Marle and co. are definitely not standing in Sector 6 - they are standing in Sector 7. You can revisit those same areas, walk down the path that the children run down. Everything is identical; from the buildings, the layout, the debris, canisters lying around, everything exactly as it was post plate collapse in chapters 13 and 14. It’s not just reused assets, it’s the same exact location and you can stand there in game and check for yourself. The only thing out of place is the skybox, which is not consistent with what is seen elsewhere in the game (and the orientation of skybox and the pillar are also 180 degrees out of phase with how the buildings are oriented).

My post if you haven’t seen it already:

Edit: I do agree that people tend to favour theories that are in line with what they want the Remake series to be, even if the evidence contradicts it. All I can say is this is not the case for me. My theory for what’s going on changed about 4 times in the first month after release of Part 1, then a couple of times after that, including when I did this analysis for myself. And the scenes in Intermission also have me reconsidering everything yet again. I’m not set on any particular theory, I am just changing my view as more evidence is laid out and analysis done on it.
                        I read your post, and your analysis is sound. 

I don't disagree that there's something fishy going on with the skybox -- I just think it's intentional, and they're telling us something about how things are different post-whisper battle.

The entire scene is set up for a deliberate pan up to show the plates. But we'll see when Part 2 comes around (maybe)!
        Not gonna say no. But as I said bellow I do believe these scenes aren't even real, so if it is messed up it still makes sense in my theory :)
        >All the buildings and details of environment are identical to what we can see in sector 7 in other chapters post plate collapse

That's not actually true though, the hole to Deepground isn't there, and the Seventh Heaven sign is the one pre plate fall (after getting damaged by the helicopter that falls). 

Also the whole area is rotated completely differently.
            I looked at it pretty closely and think that the hole to Deepground is out of shot in those scenes, not necessarily absent. I addressed the other points in the post.
                >Deepground is out of shot in those scenes, not necessarily absent.

I think if it was there that little girl would be chatting with Weiss right now.
    I hope you're right...
It's obviously deliberate. People were VERY vocal about this. Highly unlikely it's a mistake.
You can see my comment above, it's absolutely a design decision imo.
    I'm still in that court too. I think it's more logical to assume the re-used **minor** S7 assets around this cutscene are to save time and to depict S6 using non-noticeable re-use.

The skybox is the **major** asset in the scene, what I would call a landmark. To use the S6 skybox here has to be by choice and not error. They had the perfect skybox ready to use from the 'day midgar stood still' chapter etc. Also the panning of the camera is a 'reveal' motion, meaning what we pan up to is something of importance, which only makes sense if its the S6 skybox showing that S7 is still standing.
        >Also the panning of the camera is a 'reveal' motion, meaning what we pan up to is something of importance, which only makes sense if its the S6 skybox showing that S7 is still standing.

Exactly, I think this is what a lot of people miss. This the same game where when Cloud sees Jenovaroth for the first time he immediately grabs his left arm, the arm he  is afflicted with Geostigma in AC, its a ridiculously tiny detail yet they still included it. These guys understand what they want to show, in fact directing cutscenes is their bread and butter.
Yes, still an error. They'll fix it one day, after they've already sold us three other versions of 7R. They don't care and it keeps fans talking about the game, I mean look at this thread. 

Why would there be S7 debris in S6 if the plate didn't fall?

Edit: my views have changed based on new information.
    I would buy it though haha...  


Maybe a day one patch would fix it... I'm being sarcastic here..
    Its a case of 2 conflicting errors. Either the rubble is an error/corner cut, or the skybox is an error.

I lean towards the former and specifically a 'corner cut' because I see the S7 rubble as minor assets, i.e. things you wouldn't notice/connect unless you looked back and compared closely. Its likely they reused this to create a liveable S6 slum environment.

Whereas the S6 skybox is a major asset/landmark, especially with the panning scene it is the main thing you notice in this scene; like instantly you go 'huh? That's S7 standing?'

The corner-cut doesn't apply to S6 skybox either because they had the perfect skybox from the day midgar stood still chapter they could have used.

So its either a massive faux pas by SE with the skybox or an understandable re-use of minor assets.

Considering its the final cutscenes and its not corrected in Intergrade I have to go with the latter.
        Like I said, it creates more discussion around a game that's already been out for a year. This topic has been discussed *daily* since the game released. They won't fix it until the whole story is complete.
        I retract my previous statement. It's intentional. There's a purgatory in the lifestream that is visualized according to the memories of those lost souls. They all have memories prior to the plate falling so that purgatory Midgar looks the way it did prior to their death. We see things from the perspective of the dead
            Are you referring to the fact that in 'On a way to a smile' Aeris mentions the existence of souls who haven't come to terms with their death yet still existing in the lifestream.

So you're saying that manifests with them being in some sort of half-way realm which looks just like reality except looking how they remember it?

That is an amazing theory if so. That would explain ALOT, eg the church looks different because its how Zack remembers it. It could even explain the different styling of Midgar in Zack's gold dust scene, perhaps this is the way Zack remembers Midgar (as a fortress etc). I wonder if then the gold dust represents the transition to death or waking in this half-way realm? It would mean Biggs hasn't accepted his death either, perhaps the Jessie glove is a representation that she has and has already moved on.

Only thing it doesn't quite explain is Marle, as far as we know she survived the plate drop, so not sure why she'd be seeing the half-way realm S7.

But I like this idea, rather than a different timeline, its just a realm where the souls haven't accepted their fate yet. 

Tbh this could also explain something else; there's something not right with all the people in the church in Zack's intergrade scene. They don't look like S7 survivors to me; they're acting too weird. More than half the people look dazed and in stupor, the rest look confused/upset. If they've all recently just awoken there in this half-way realm then their behaviour would make sense.
                u/IISuperSlothII how much of this aligns with your thoughts? \^\^\^\^
                    It's close in idea but I have a few differences.

The whole of Remake is Clouds memory in the lifestream (besides Zacks scenes) being corrupted by Sephiroth, so everyone we meet besides Red XIII and Marlene is already dead, its just Clouds memory of them.

Zacks scenes are his memory in the lifestream being corrupted by Sephiroth, so all the different details like Midgar and Stamp are his memory.

The ending of both games then presents a different area, close to what November is describing, a manifestation of the planets collective memory where the conscious of those not yet dissipated into the lifestream exist, but its been changed due to Sephiroths influence with the harbinger. Zacks scene is a part of that.

I'm still 50/50 on the last part, the end of Remake might be Clouds memory having been messed up, while the end of intermission is Zacks consciousness in the lifestream wondering the planet like Elmyras husband.

Who'd have thought a year ago its November who's theories I most line up with haha, although I think it was he who made the memory theory which got me to look at things from a different perspective.
                        Yeah I think the 'whole of remake is Cloud's memory' is the hardest for me to get on board with. It removes all jeopardy from the story if you get me? And it also would be a completely new concept, reliving your entire life in the lifestream/your memories.

I think I much prefer that remake is a physical reality in which there is real jeopardy to the planet and the Zack scenes are him in a bit of a Sixth Sense phase (like many others following the S7 plate drop).

Telling the story of Zack and these others in this half-way state could culminate in Aeris joining them and us seeing the events of 'on a way to a smile' in the game. Eg culminating in all these lost souls finally accepting their fate and coming together at the end to help Holy defeat Meteor.
                            >It removes all jeopardy from the story if you get me? And it also would be a completely new concept, reliving your entire life in the lifestream/your memories.

I've actually tweaked my theory on that. I'm now with the idea that Sephiroth has simply just corrupted their memories.

When a person dies their consciousness continues in the lifestream for a small amount of time before return to the planet, we know that to be true, within the consciousness is the memory, when a person becomes one with the planet their memory is retained while their consciousness is lost, this means they are separate entities to the planet, and messing with memory is Jenova 101.

I actually think it makes more sense Sephiroth would try to win from inside the lifestream having consistently failed on the surface.
                                Yeah but how would it play out that Sephiroth messing with Cloud's memories in the lifestream would result in him 'winning' and physically controlling the entire planet and its lifestream? That's the jeopardy I'm missing in the theory.

I think for storytelling purposes there has to be a *simple* jeopardy at play. Sounds a bit too convoluted at the moment to be the main purpose of remake if you get me? Eg its alot easier to understand 'Seph's fucking with the past to have another bite at the cherry' than 'he's messing with Cloud's memories that actually for some reason magically gives him an 'in' at controlling the entire planet'.

Unless of course Gaia exists on a physical cycle/loop of life that replays exactly each time but this 'replaying of exact events' is fulfilled through use of the lifestream's past memories. So by tampering with key memories Sephiroth is effectively orchestrating the next cycle to be different. The whispers would then represent soul's who's memories are getting affected/split/out of sync due to the changes, hence why they're fight to keep things on track - because to them thats how it should be. I'd even go as far as saying the whisper that saved Barret's life would then perhaps be Barret's soul himself.

My only issue with any physical cycle/loop of life on Gaia theory is regarding the 'coming of Jenova'. She is outside of the control of Gaia, so when the loop is reset, Her body would no longer be waiting for Shinra to find as we kill it during the course of FF7. So either the entire universe is on a loop which sounds a bit farfetched for this, or its a time loop. Eg the Planet itself has invoked a Time-travel based loop itself, which cycles back physical reality on Gaia back to a point *after* Jenova fell. Eg < 2000 years ago.

Which actually now considering it could the case right? We know that the Cetra found a way to contain/trap Jenova but the details are never confirmed. I wonder if this containment/trap is actually to introduce a 2000-2500 year time loop. I know this has already been thought up but the missing part is the mechanics of it (and how events play out identical each time). We're saying this is through the lifestreams memory. So in a way this aligns with alot of the principles of your theory, that Sephiroth is tainting Cloud's memories, orchestrating the next cycle (which is remake). This would at least put the physical world in jeopardy and also explain/align with the presence and mechanic of the Harbinger, which for all intents and purposes seems to be time-steward related. I wonder if it's the Harbinger himself who is responsible for enacting the reset each time too. So by destroying him we've undone the creation of any future loops. It remains to be seen if it's killed all the whispers though. If they are soul's with conflicting memories then they may indeed continue to appear as we continue to go off course compared to OG.

Going off on a tangent, it makes me wonder, if indeed 'altering memories' is the way to effect future cycles then this potentially adds more importance to the Edge of Creation scene. "7 seconds til the end" for Cloud to do something. What if Cloud decided to alter his memory to Zack surviving? Cinematically Zack's survival scene is shown straight after edge of creation scene. It always felt that this was linked. But then this is back to 'Zack surviving timeline' theories... urgh really wish we had more info to at least have an idea of where this was going
                Yeah that's what I'm rolling with, it seems so likely at this point. I can't take all the credit because I really derived it from Supersloth. As for Marle. yeah she seems like an inconsistency but I think that what's going on is that they're showing us a cross over between life and death.

 What I mean is the gold dust gives us, the player, a view of the real world with elements of the purgatory. So we see the survivors in the slums, like Marle, but we also see the purgatory elements like the plate as long as the dust is present. It's like visualized memories, Marle looks up at where the plate was remembering it's presence so that's what we see.

Edit: It also lines up with parts of FFX's Farplane concept and the Farplane itself was created based on unused concepts from FF7. So it looks like 7R will be adapting some of the cut material from the OG into it.
                    Ah okay, so as the gold dust falls it acts as a curtain that gives us a temporary look at into this twilight realm. I could buy that.

Telling the story of Zack and these others in this half-way state could culminate in Aeris joining them (after her passing) and us seeing the events of 'on a way to a smile' happen in the game. Eg Aeris trying to help all these lost souls finally accepting their fate and coming together at the end to help Holy defeat Meteor. That would be a remake that truly factors in all compilation and supporting material.
                        It works and fits in really well. It could be just like FF2's Dawn of Souls chapter and I could totally see that being either a DLC or sequel to Crisis Core on it's own.
                            Just thinking about this a bit further, it doesn't need to be far detached from the multiple realities/science-led theories either. Are you familiar with 'Schrodingers cat'?

I wonder if this half-way realm is actually a big mistake/error? So rather than this always being what happens to lost souls who need to find their way to merging with the lifestream, instead what we did with the Harbinger in the Singularity created a Schrodingers cat paradox. So just like the cat in that example Zack is both alive and dead at the same time. Depending how this is implemented it could also be the case for all people who died thanks to whisper involvement between the time of Zack's Last Stand to the end of Remake. Potentially explaining the groggy/stupified people in the church.

This could be Nomura's way of explaining why Zack - who lets be honest, pretty much accepted his death happily in all the tellings of his last stand - Ended up not becoming one with the planet and maintaining his sentiency right up to Advent Children, and possibly beyond. Even at the end of AC it's not confirmed whether he finally dissolves into the lifestream or not.

So it's not multiple 'timelines', it is potentially a singularity/paradox event that creates this shadow realm where those who died due to whisper actions are reborn but not on the same plane of existence as the rest of humanity.
                                Yes, I agree. A lot of what was considered evidence of multiple timelines applies here. I think this purgatory/singularity I an effect of Sephiroth halting the flow of souls returning to the planet. Like a pocket death universe where he's storing up souls to become a god. Much like the way Shinra uses souls to make electricity Sephiroth wants to use them to achieve his goals of eternal memory/ existence.

If Zack remains in purgatory he can't diffuse into the lifestream, and if he can't diffuse into the lifestream his memories of Sephiroth will live on into eternity. Same if Sephiroth were successful in killing Cloud, he'd be trapped in Sephiroths purgatory.
    This is a ridiculous take. It is very obviously a design choice and hint regarding the future story.
        Sure, ok.
It was never an error.
Diffeline.

Got railed for saying this after Remake. You can see the same at the end of Remake -- the plate's still up.
So.... isn't a possible conclusion that Cloud and Co stopped the Turks from triggering platefall at the end of Chapter 12 in this "timeline"? How else would Biggs even survive?
    That was actually my first theory upon completing the game, with Zack being the main reason though, but the fact that the continuity of them being in the sector 7 slums but under sector 6 and facing the wrong direction is off really does raise some major questions with that theory being something that simple.
        I have seen a similar issue where you see the particular skybox (sector 6) every time you are in the slums. When you go through sector 5 with Aerith and look up, it is also the sector 6 skybox that appears. 

Why would this discredit a "no platefall" approach?

Isn't this a more general technical issue ? Skyboxes in general were very static.
            >When you go through sector 5 with Aerith and look up, it is also the sector 6 skybox that appears. 

That's an in game issue, where the sky box fails to rotate with the player correctly.

The ending was pre rendered which means technical issues shouldn't be a part of it, as they can skew things exactly to how they want them before recording.

>Why would this discredit a "no platefall" approach?

It's more it discredits its simply just another timeline with no platefall.
                >That's an in game issue, where the sky box fails to rotate with the player correctly.

No. The skybox is a static image, not a 3D environment. It can't "rotate" to have a different plate above you as you move. There's no loading screens between Sector 5 and Sector 6, so there's no time to change to a different skybox. However, they could have just put in one of those fixed camera crouching sections or something between the sectors and changed the skybox at that point.
            If you watch the 2019 trailers (the TGS one if I'm not mistaken) The skybox is correct when you meet Rude, you can even see Sector 6's skybox next to Sector 5's
                That was also an early version running on a developers PC, any number of things could have gone wrong to offset that between then and when the compiled the gold build.

The likelihood this is an error is vanishingly small given how platefall is one of the pinnacle events of the entire game. Most of the things people gripe about are related to hardware limitations (textures, etc.) -- and even the PS5 can't play this game with full 4K textures at 60 FPS (hopefully we get a PC version someday). 

The desire for this to be an error seems to stem more from a desire for the game not to be making a radical departure than anything else. What they're showing us in this scene is the group, post-Whispers, standing in Sector 6 looking at an intact Sector 7. Whether this means the plate structure/numbering was rotated around, another sector was destroyed, or Sector 7 was saved, we don't know. But to say they made an error in a very deliberate scene is a heck of a leap of logic.
                Your first sentence kind of justifies how this seemingly huge error could have been made in the final moments of production. Too many people having input, struggling to meet deadlines etc. As unlikely as it is (and I originally thought), this appears to be what happened. I hate to plug my own thread all the time but did you see my analysis of those scenes? Marle and co. are definitely not standing in Sector 6 - they are standing in Sector 7. You can revisit those same areas, walk down the path that the children run down. Everything is identical; from the buildings, the layout, the debris, canisters lying around, everything exactly as it was post plate collapse in chapters 13 and 14. It’s not just reused assets, it’s the same exact location and you can stand there in game and check for yourself. The only thing out of place is the skybox, which is not consistent with what is seen elsewhere in the game (and the orientation of skybox and the pillar are also 180 degrees out of phase with how the buildings are oriented).

Edit: I do agree that people tend to favour theories that are in line with what they want the Remake series to be, even if the evidence contradicts it. All I can say is this is not the case for me. My theory for what’s going on changed about 4 times in the first month after release of Part 1, then a couple of times after that, including when I did this analysis for myself. And the scenes in Intermission also have me reconsidering everything yet again. I’m not set on any particular theory, I am just changing my view as more evidence is laid out and analysis done on it.
                    I read your post, and your analysis is sound. 

I don't disagree that there's something fishy going on with the skybox -- I just think it's intentional, and they're telling us something about how things are different post-whisper battle.

The entire scene is set up for a deliberate pan up to show the plates. But we'll see when Part 2 comes around (maybe)!
    Not gonna say no. But as I said bellow I do believe these scenes aren't even real, so if it is messed up it still makes sense in my theory :)
    >All the buildings and details of environment are identical to what we can see in sector 7 in other chapters post plate collapse

That's not actually true though, the hole to Deepground isn't there, and the Seventh Heaven sign is the one pre plate fall (after getting damaged by the helicopter that falls). 

Also the whole area is rotated completely differently.
        I looked at it pretty closely and think that the hole to Deepground is out of shot in those scenes, not necessarily absent. I addressed the other points in the post.
            >Deepground is out of shot in those scenes, not necessarily absent.

I think if it was there that little girl would be chatting with Weiss right now.
I hope you're right...
I'm still in that court too. I think it's more logical to assume the re-used **minor** S7 assets around this cutscene are to save time and to depict S6 using non-noticeable re-use.

The skybox is the **major** asset in the scene, what I would call a landmark. To use the S6 skybox here has to be by choice and not error. They had the perfect skybox ready to use from the 'day midgar stood still' chapter etc. Also the panning of the camera is a 'reveal' motion, meaning what we pan up to is something of importance, which only makes sense if its the S6 skybox showing that S7 is still standing.
    >Also the panning of the camera is a 'reveal' motion, meaning what we pan up to is something of importance, which only makes sense if its the S6 skybox showing that S7 is still standing.

Exactly, I think this is what a lot of people miss. This the same game where when Cloud sees Jenovaroth for the first time he immediately grabs his left arm, the arm he  is afflicted with Geostigma in AC, its a ridiculously tiny detail yet they still included it. These guys understand what they want to show, in fact directing cutscenes is their bread and butter.
I would buy it though haha...  


Maybe a day one patch would fix it... I'm being sarcastic here..
Its a case of 2 conflicting errors. Either the rubble is an error/corner cut, or the skybox is an error.

I lean towards the former and specifically a 'corner cut' because I see the S7 rubble as minor assets, i.e. things you wouldn't notice/connect unless you looked back and compared closely. Its likely they reused this to create a liveable S6 slum environment.

Whereas the S6 skybox is a major asset/landmark, especially with the panning scene it is the main thing you notice in this scene; like instantly you go 'huh? That's S7 standing?'

The corner-cut doesn't apply to S6 skybox either because they had the perfect skybox from the day midgar stood still chapter they could have used.

So its either a massive faux pas by SE with the skybox or an understandable re-use of minor assets.

Considering its the final cutscenes and its not corrected in Intergrade I have to go with the latter.
    Like I said, it creates more discussion around a game that's already been out for a year. This topic has been discussed *daily* since the game released. They won't fix it until the whole story is complete.
    I retract my previous statement. It's intentional. There's a purgatory in the lifestream that is visualized according to the memories of those lost souls. They all have memories prior to the plate falling so that purgatory Midgar looks the way it did prior to their death. We see things from the perspective of the dead
        Are you referring to the fact that in 'On a way to a smile' Aeris mentions the existence of souls who haven't come to terms with their death yet still existing in the lifestream.

So you're saying that manifests with them being in some sort of half-way realm which looks just like reality except looking how they remember it?

That is an amazing theory if so. That would explain ALOT, eg the church looks different because its how Zack remembers it. It could even explain the different styling of Midgar in Zack's gold dust scene, perhaps this is the way Zack remembers Midgar (as a fortress etc). I wonder if then the gold dust represents the transition to death or waking in this half-way realm? It would mean Biggs hasn't accepted his death either, perhaps the Jessie glove is a representation that she has and has already moved on.

Only thing it doesn't quite explain is Marle, as far as we know she survived the plate drop, so not sure why she'd be seeing the half-way realm S7.

But I like this idea, rather than a different timeline, its just a realm where the souls haven't accepted their fate yet. 

Tbh this could also explain something else; there's something not right with all the people in the church in Zack's intergrade scene. They don't look like S7 survivors to me; they're acting too weird. More than half the people look dazed and in stupor, the rest look confused/upset. If they've all recently just awoken there in this half-way realm then their behaviour would make sense.
            u/IISuperSlothII how much of this aligns with your thoughts? \^\^\^\^
                It's close in idea but I have a few differences.

The whole of Remake is Clouds memory in the lifestream (besides Zacks scenes) being corrupted by Sephiroth, so everyone we meet besides Red XIII and Marlene is already dead, its just Clouds memory of them.

Zacks scenes are his memory in the lifestream being corrupted by Sephiroth, so all the different details like Midgar and Stamp are his memory.

The ending of both games then presents a different area, close to what November is describing, a manifestation of the planets collective memory where the conscious of those not yet dissipated into the lifestream exist, but its been changed due to Sephiroths influence with the harbinger. Zacks scene is a part of that.

I'm still 50/50 on the last part, the end of Remake might be Clouds memory having been messed up, while the end of intermission is Zacks consciousness in the lifestream wondering the planet like Elmyras husband.

Who'd have thought a year ago its November who's theories I most line up with haha, although I think it was he who made the memory theory which got me to look at things from a different perspective.
                    Yeah I think the 'whole of remake is Cloud's memory' is the hardest for me to get on board with. It removes all jeopardy from the story if you get me? And it also would be a completely new concept, reliving your entire life in the lifestream/your memories.

I think I much prefer that remake is a physical reality in which there is real jeopardy to the planet and the Zack scenes are him in a bit of a Sixth Sense phase (like many others following the S7 plate drop).

Telling the story of Zack and these others in this half-way state could culminate in Aeris joining them and us seeing the events of 'on a way to a smile' in the game. Eg culminating in all these lost souls finally accepting their fate and coming together at the end to help Holy defeat Meteor.
                        >It removes all jeopardy from the story if you get me? And it also would be a completely new concept, reliving your entire life in the lifestream/your memories.

I've actually tweaked my theory on that. I'm now with the idea that Sephiroth has simply just corrupted their memories.

When a person dies their consciousness continues in the lifestream for a small amount of time before return to the planet, we know that to be true, within the consciousness is the memory, when a person becomes one with the planet their memory is retained while their consciousness is lost, this means they are separate entities to the planet, and messing with memory is Jenova 101.

I actually think it makes more sense Sephiroth would try to win from inside the lifestream having consistently failed on the surface.
                            Yeah but how would it play out that Sephiroth messing with Cloud's memories in the lifestream would result in him 'winning' and physically controlling the entire planet and its lifestream? That's the jeopardy I'm missing in the theory.

I think for storytelling purposes there has to be a *simple* jeopardy at play. Sounds a bit too convoluted at the moment to be the main purpose of remake if you get me? Eg its alot easier to understand 'Seph's fucking with the past to have another bite at the cherry' than 'he's messing with Cloud's memories that actually for some reason magically gives him an 'in' at controlling the entire planet'.

Unless of course Gaia exists on a physical cycle/loop of life that replays exactly each time but this 'replaying of exact events' is fulfilled through use of the lifestream's past memories. So by tampering with key memories Sephiroth is effectively orchestrating the next cycle to be different. The whispers would then represent soul's who's memories are getting affected/split/out of sync due to the changes, hence why they're fight to keep things on track - because to them thats how it should be. I'd even go as far as saying the whisper that saved Barret's life would then perhaps be Barret's soul himself.

My only issue with any physical cycle/loop of life on Gaia theory is regarding the 'coming of Jenova'. She is outside of the control of Gaia, so when the loop is reset, Her body would no longer be waiting for Shinra to find as we kill it during the course of FF7. So either the entire universe is on a loop which sounds a bit farfetched for this, or its a time loop. Eg the Planet itself has invoked a Time-travel based loop itself, which cycles back physical reality on Gaia back to a point *after* Jenova fell. Eg < 2000 years ago.

Which actually now considering it could the case right? We know that the Cetra found a way to contain/trap Jenova but the details are never confirmed. I wonder if this containment/trap is actually to introduce a 2000-2500 year time loop. I know this has already been thought up but the missing part is the mechanics of it (and how events play out identical each time). We're saying this is through the lifestreams memory. So in a way this aligns with alot of the principles of your theory, that Sephiroth is tainting Cloud's memories, orchestrating the next cycle (which is remake). This would at least put the physical world in jeopardy and also explain/align with the presence and mechanic of the Harbinger, which for all intents and purposes seems to be time-steward related. I wonder if it's the Harbinger himself who is responsible for enacting the reset each time too. So by destroying him we've undone the creation of any future loops. It remains to be seen if it's killed all the whispers though. If they are soul's with conflicting memories then they may indeed continue to appear as we continue to go off course compared to OG.

Going off on a tangent, it makes me wonder, if indeed 'altering memories' is the way to effect future cycles then this potentially adds more importance to the Edge of Creation scene. "7 seconds til the end" for Cloud to do something. What if Cloud decided to alter his memory to Zack surviving? Cinematically Zack's survival scene is shown straight after edge of creation scene. It always felt that this was linked. But then this is back to 'Zack surviving timeline' theories... urgh really wish we had more info to at least have an idea of where this was going
            Yeah that's what I'm rolling with, it seems so likely at this point. I can't take all the credit because I really derived it from Supersloth. As for Marle. yeah she seems like an inconsistency but I think that what's going on is that they're showing us a cross over between life and death.

 What I mean is the gold dust gives us, the player, a view of the real world with elements of the purgatory. So we see the survivors in the slums, like Marle, but we also see the purgatory elements like the plate as long as the dust is present. It's like visualized memories, Marle looks up at where the plate was remembering it's presence so that's what we see.

Edit: It also lines up with parts of FFX's Farplane concept and the Farplane itself was created based on unused concepts from FF7. So it looks like 7R will be adapting some of the cut material from the OG into it.
                Ah okay, so as the gold dust falls it acts as a curtain that gives us a temporary look at into this twilight realm. I could buy that.

Telling the story of Zack and these others in this half-way state could culminate in Aeris joining them (after her passing) and us seeing the events of 'on a way to a smile' happen in the game. Eg Aeris trying to help all these lost souls finally accepting their fate and coming together at the end to help Holy defeat Meteor. That would be a remake that truly factors in all compilation and supporting material.
                    It works and fits in really well. It could be just like FF2's Dawn of Souls chapter and I could totally see that being either a DLC or sequel to Crisis Core on it's own.
                        Just thinking about this a bit further, it doesn't need to be far detached from the multiple realities/science-led theories either. Are you familiar with 'Schrodingers cat'?

I wonder if this half-way realm is actually a big mistake/error? So rather than this always being what happens to lost souls who need to find their way to merging with the lifestream, instead what we did with the Harbinger in the Singularity created a Schrodingers cat paradox. So just like the cat in that example Zack is both alive and dead at the same time. Depending how this is implemented it could also be the case for all people who died thanks to whisper involvement between the time of Zack's Last Stand to the end of Remake. Potentially explaining the groggy/stupified people in the church.

This could be Nomura's way of explaining why Zack - who lets be honest, pretty much accepted his death happily in all the tellings of his last stand - Ended up not becoming one with the planet and maintaining his sentiency right up to Advent Children, and possibly beyond. Even at the end of AC it's not confirmed whether he finally dissolves into the lifestream or not.

So it's not multiple 'timelines', it is potentially a singularity/paradox event that creates this shadow realm where those who died due to whisper actions are reborn but not on the same plane of existence as the rest of humanity.
                            Yes, I agree. A lot of what was considered evidence of multiple timelines applies here. I think this purgatory/singularity I an effect of Sephiroth halting the flow of souls returning to the planet. Like a pocket death universe where he's storing up souls to become a god. Much like the way Shinra uses souls to make electricity Sephiroth wants to use them to achieve his goals of eternal memory/ existence.

If Zack remains in purgatory he can't diffuse into the lifestream, and if he can't diffuse into the lifestream his memories of Sephiroth will live on into eternity. Same if Sephiroth were successful in killing Cloud, he'd be trapped in Sephiroths purgatory.
This is a ridiculous take. It is very obviously a design choice and hint regarding the future story.
    Sure, ok.
That was actually my first theory upon completing the game, with Zack being the main reason though, but the fact that the continuity of them being in the sector 7 slums but under sector 6 and facing the wrong direction is off really does raise some major questions with that theory being something that simple.
    I have seen a similar issue where you see the particular skybox (sector 6) every time you are in the slums. When you go through sector 5 with Aerith and look up, it is also the sector 6 skybox that appears. 

Why would this discredit a "no platefall" approach?

Isn't this a more general technical issue ? Skyboxes in general were very static.
        >When you go through sector 5 with Aerith and look up, it is also the sector 6 skybox that appears. 

That's an in game issue, where the sky box fails to rotate with the player correctly.

The ending was pre rendered which means technical issues shouldn't be a part of it, as they can skew things exactly to how they want them before recording.

>Why would this discredit a "no platefall" approach?

It's more it discredits its simply just another timeline with no platefall.
            >That's an in game issue, where the sky box fails to rotate with the player correctly.

No. The skybox is a static image, not a 3D environment. It can't "rotate" to have a different plate above you as you move. There's no loading screens between Sector 5 and Sector 6, so there's no time to change to a different skybox. However, they could have just put in one of those fixed camera crouching sections or something between the sectors and changed the skybox at that point.
        If you watch the 2019 trailers (the TGS one if I'm not mistaken) The skybox is correct when you meet Rude, you can even see Sector 6's skybox next to Sector 5's
            That was also an early version running on a developers PC, any number of things could have gone wrong to offset that between then and when the compiled the gold build.
It’s possible, but then you realise shinra’s could just send another wave within the hour, it really was a no win scenario for sector 7
Look up the chapter where you rescue Marlene as Aerith -- there's a ton of destruction there already even before the plate fell.
Not sure I follow. The plate being up in the ending is after destroying the Whispers and saving Zack (and anything else that may have been altered), and time is different.
    [removed]
        Would assume Chapter 13 takes place toward the edge of the plate, while Chapter 15 shows the full extent of damage. You don't walk that far in Chapter 13.

Generally speaking the game's scale is tough to gauge. Going from plate to plate would be much quicker toward the pillar than away. But they didn't go very far into the wreckage in Chapter 13.
I really don't know what is Square trying to pull here... It's not that hard to show an empty plate rather than reusing Sector 6's
    This is a deliberate story choice. It's not a mistake.
Can't really answer that, maybe in some cuts they are in sector 7 others in sector 6 serving food, because even if it didn't fall maybe they are re moving to sector 6.
But in my opinion this, in the ending with all that gold dust in the air, is only cloud mind re-editing what happened and saying to himself that everything is all right. The same way his mind rewrote the nibelhein incident.
He wants to believe that Zack survived, that he carried him to midgar, that the plate didn't fall...and this leads to these inconsistencies
There was still a battle. Go back to the chapter where the plate fell, and everything's on fire. Helicopters crashed. Seventh Heaven was damaged during that encounter but platefall was prevented. The obvious angle would be Zack.
It's pretty obvious this was a deliberate choice by the developers and is a hint as to where the story goes from here.
    I did think that initially too, since the camera angle and everything seemed set up to show it in a subtle way. But having checked out the details it doesn’t add up so now I’m sure it’s just an error. However, if my post didn’t convince you there’s nothing else to say.
        They have in multiple interviews noted how the ending used to be much more slimmed down, and then toward the end of development they got excited and layered in a bunch of hints as to how the story changes from here. They were very deliberate about what they chose to include, and this scene is choreographed precisely to show you the skybox.

Eg its alot easier to understand 'Seph's fucking with the past to have another bite at the cherry' than 'he's messing with Cloud's memories that actually for some reason magically gives him an 'in' at controlling the entire planet'.

Unless of course Gaia exists on a physical cycle/loop of life that replays exactly each time but this 'replaying of exact events' is fulfilled through use of the lifestream's past memories. So by tampering with key memories Sephiroth is effectively orchestrating the next cycle to be different. The whispers would then represent soul's who's memories are getting affected/split/out of sync due to the changes, hence why they're fight to keep things on track - because to them thats how it should be. I'd even go as far as saying the whisper that saved Barret's life would then perhaps be Barret's soul himself.

My only issue with any physical cycle/loop of life on Gaia theory is regarding the 'coming of Jenova'. She is outside of the control of Gaia, so when the loop is reset, Her body would no longer be waiting for Shinra to find as we kill it during the course of FF7. So either the entire universe is on a loop which sounds a bit farfetched for this, or its a time loop. Eg the Planet itself has invoked a Time-travel based loop itself, which cycles back physical reality on Gaia back to a point *after* Jenova fell. Eg < 2000 years ago.

Which actually now considering it could the case right? We know that the Cetra found a way to contain/trap Jenova but the details are never confirmed. I wonder if this containment/trap is actually to introduce a 2000-2500 year time loop. I know this has already been thought up but the missing part is the mechanics of it (and how events play out identical each time). We're saying this is through the lifestreams memory. So in a way this aligns with alot of the principles of your theory, that Sephiroth is tainting Cloud's memories, orchestrating the next cycle (which is remake). This would at least put the physical world in jeopardy and also explain/align with the presence and mechanic of the Harbinger, which for all intents and purposes seems to be time-steward related. I wonder if it's the Harbinger himself who is responsible for enacting the reset each time too. So by destroying him we've undone the creation of any future loops. It remains to be seen if it's killed all the whispers though. If they are soul's with conflicting memories then they may indeed continue to appear as we continue to go off course compared to OG.

Going off on a tangent, it makes me wonder, if indeed 'altering memories' is the way to effect future cycles then this potentially adds more importance to the Edge of Creation scene. "7 seconds til the end" for Cloud to do something. What if Cloud decided to alter his memory to Zack surviving? Cinematically Zack's survival scene is shown straight after edge of creation scene. It always felt that this was linked. But then this is back to 'Zack surviving timeline' theories... urgh really wish we had more info to at least have an idea of where this was going
        Yeah that's what I'm rolling with, it seems so likely at this point. I can't take all the credit because I really derived it from Supersloth. As for Marle. yeah she seems like an inconsistency but I think that what's going on is that they're showing us a cross over between life and death.

 What I mean is the gold dust gives us, the player, a view of the real world with elements of the purgatory. So we see the survivors in the slums, like Marle, but we also see the purgatory elements like the plate as long as the dust is present. It's like visualized memories, Marle looks up at where the plate was remembering it's presence so that's what we see.

Edit: It also lines up with parts of FFX's Farplane concept and the Farplane itself was created based on unused concepts from FF7. So it looks like 7R will be adapting some of the cut material from the OG into it.
            Ah okay, so as the gold dust falls it acts as a curtain that gives us a temporary look at into this twilight realm. I could buy that.

Telling the story of Zack and these others in this half-way state could culminate in Aeris joining them (after her passing) and us seeing the events of 'on a way to a smile' happen in the game. Eg Aeris trying to help all these lost souls finally accepting their fate and coming together at the end to help Holy defeat Meteor. That would be a remake that truly factors in all compilation and supporting material.
                It works and fits in really well. It could be just like FF2's Dawn of Souls chapter and I could totally see that being either a DLC or sequel to Crisis Core on it's own.
                    Just thinking about this a bit further, it doesn't need to be far detached from the multiple realities/science-led theories either. Are you familiar with 'Schrodingers cat'?

I wonder if this half-way realm is actually a big mistake/error? So rather than this always being what happens to lost souls who need to find their way to merging with the lifestream, instead what we did with the Harbinger in the Singularity created a Schrodingers cat paradox. So just like the cat in that example Zack is both alive and dead at the same time. Depending how this is implemented it could also be the case for all people who died thanks to whisper involvement between the time of Zack's Last Stand to the end of Remake. Potentially explaining the groggy/stupified people in the church.

This could be Nomura's way of explaining why Zack - who lets be honest, pretty much accepted his death happily in all the tellings of his last stand - Ended up not becoming one with the planet and maintaining his sentiency right up to Advent Children, and possibly beyond. Even at the end of AC it's not confirmed whether he finally dissolves into the lifestream or not.

So it's not multiple 'timelines', it is potentially a singularity/paradox event that creates this shadow realm where those who died due to whisper actions are reborn but not on the same plane of existence as the rest of humanity.
                        Yes, I agree. A lot of what was considered evidence of multiple timelines applies here. I think this purgatory/singularity I an effect of Sephiroth halting the flow of souls returning to the planet. Like a pocket death universe where he's storing up souls to become a god. Much like the way Shinra uses souls to make electricity Sephiroth wants to use them to achieve his goals of eternal memory/ existence.

If Zack remains in purgatory he can't diffuse into the lifestream, and if he can't diffuse into the lifestream his memories of Sephiroth will live on into eternity. Same if Sephiroth were successful in killing Cloud, he'd be trapped in Sephiroths purgatory.
Sure, ok.
I have seen a similar issue where you see the particular skybox (sector 6) every time you are in the slums. When you go through sector 5 with Aerith and look up, it is also the sector 6 skybox that appears. 

Why would this discredit a "no platefall" approach?

Isn't this a more general technical issue ? Skyboxes in general were very static.
    >When you go through sector 5 with Aerith and look up, it is also the sector 6 skybox that appears. 

That's an in game issue, where the sky box fails to rotate with the player correctly.

The ending was pre rendered which means technical issues shouldn't be a part of it, as they can skew things exactly to how they want them before recording.

>Why would this discredit a "no platefall" approach?

It's more it discredits its simply just another timeline with no platefall.
        >That's an in game issue, where the sky box fails to rotate with the player correctly.

No. The skybox is a static image, not a 3D environment. It can't "rotate" to have a different plate above you as you move. There's no loading screens between Sector 5 and Sector 6, so there's no time to change to a different skybox. However, they could have just put in one of those fixed camera crouching sections or something between the sectors and changed the skybox at that point.
    If you watch the 2019 trailers (the TGS one if I'm not mistaken) The skybox is correct when you meet Rude, you can even see Sector 6's skybox next to Sector 5's
        That was also an early version running on a developers PC, any number of things could have gone wrong to offset that between then and when the compiled the gold build.

    Would assume Chapter 13 takes place toward the edge of the plate, while Chapter 15 shows the full extent of damage. You don't walk that far in Chapter 13.

Generally speaking the game's scale is tough to gauge. Going from plate to plate would be much quicker toward the pillar than away. But they didn't go very far into the wreckage in Chapter 13.
This is a deliberate story choice. It's not a mistake.
I did think that initially too, since the camera angle and everything seemed set up to show it in a subtle way. But having checked out the details it doesn’t add up so now I’m sure it’s just an error. However, if my post didn’t convince you there’s nothing else to say.
    They have in multiple interviews noted how the ending used to be much more slimmed down, and then toward the end of development they got excited and layered in a bunch of hints as to how the story changes from here. They were very deliberate about what they chose to include, and this scene is choreographed precisely to show you the skybox.

The likelihood this is an error is vanishingly small given how platefall is one of the pinnacle events of the entire game. Most of the things people gripe about are related to hardware limitations (textures, etc.) -- and even the PS5 can't play this game with full 4K textures at 60 FPS (hopefully we get a PC version someday). 

The desire for this to be an error seems to stem more from a desire for the game not to be making a radical departure than anything else. What they're showing us in this scene is the group, post-Whispers, standing in Sector 6 looking at an intact Sector 7. Whether this means the plate structure/numbering was rotated around, another sector was destroyed, or Sector 7 was saved, we don't know. But to say they made an error in a very deliberate scene is a heck of a leap of logic.
        Your first sentence kind of justifies how this seemingly huge error could have been made in the final moments of production. Too many people having input, struggling to meet deadlines etc. As unlikely as it is (and I originally thought), this appears to be what happened. I hate to plug my own thread all the time but did you see my analysis of those scenes? Marle and co. are definitely not standing in Sector 6 - they are standing in Sector 7. You can revisit those same areas, walk down the path that the children run down. Everything is identical; from the buildings, the layout, the debris, canisters lying around, everything exactly as it was post plate collapse in chapters 13 and 14. It’s not just reused assets, it’s the same exact location and you can stand there in game and check for yourself. The only thing out of place is the skybox, which is not consistent with what is seen elsewhere in the game (and the orientation of skybox and the pillar are also 180 degrees out of phase with how the buildings are oriented).

https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/jfohzs/ogremake_spoilers_clearing_up_some_details_of_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Edit: I do agree that people tend to favour theories that are in line with what they want the Remake series to be, even if the evidence contradicts it. All I can say is this is not the case for me. My theory for what’s going on changed about 4 times in the first month after release of Part 1, then a couple of times after that, including when I did this analysis for myself. And the scenes in Intermission also have me reconsidering everything yet again. I’m not set on any particular theory, I am just changing my view as more evidence is laid out and analysis done on it.
            I read your post, and your analysis is sound. 

I don't disagree that there's something fishy going on with the skybox -- I just think it's intentional, and they're telling us something about how things are different post-whisper battle.

The entire scene is set up for a deliberate pan up to show the plates. But we'll see when Part 2 comes around (maybe)!
I looked at it pretty closely and think that the hole to Deepground is out of shot in those scenes, not necessarily absent. I addressed the other points in the post.
    >Deepground is out of shot in those scenes, not necessarily absent.

I think if it was there that little girl would be chatting with Weiss right now.
Are you referring to the fact that in 'On a way to a smile' Aeris mentions the existence of souls who haven't come to terms with their death yet still existing in the lifestream.

So you're saying that manifests with them being in some sort of half-way realm which looks just like reality except looking how they remember it?

That is an amazing theory if so. That would explain ALOT, eg the church looks different because its how Zack remembers it. It could even explain the different styling of Midgar in Zack's gold dust scene, perhaps this is the way Zack remembers Midgar (as a fortress etc). I wonder if then the gold dust represents the transition to death or waking in this half-way realm? It would mean Biggs hasn't accepted his death either, perhaps the Jessie glove is a representation that she has and has already moved on.

Only thing it doesn't quite explain is Marle, as far as we know she survived the plate drop, so not sure why she'd be seeing the half-way realm S7.

But I like this idea, rather than a different timeline, its just a realm where the souls haven't accepted their fate yet. 

Tbh this could also explain something else; there's something not right with all the people in the church in Zack's intergrade scene. They don't look like S7 survivors to me; they're acting too weird. More than half the people look dazed and in stupor, the rest look confused/upset. If they've all recently just awoken there in this half-way realm then their behaviour would make sense.
    u/IISuperSlothII how much of this aligns with your thoughts? \^\^\^\^
        It's close in idea but I have a few differences.

The whole of Remake is Clouds memory in the lifestream (besides Zacks scenes) being corrupted by Sephiroth, so everyone we meet besides Red XIII and Marlene is already dead, its just Clouds memory of them.

Zacks scenes are his memory in the lifestream being corrupted by Sephiroth, so all the different details like Midgar and Stamp are his memory.

The ending of both games then presents a different area, close to what November is describing, a manifestation of the planets collective memory where the conscious of those not yet dissipated into the lifestream exist, but its been changed due to Sephiroths influence with the harbinger. Zacks scene is a part of that.

I'm still 50/50 on the last part, the end of Remake might be Clouds memory having been messed up, while the end of intermission is Zacks consciousness in the lifestream wondering the planet like Elmyras husband.

Who'd have thought a year ago its November who's theories I most line up with haha, although I think it was he who made the memory theory which got me to look at things from a different perspective.
            Yeah I think the 'whole of remake is Cloud's memory' is the hardest for me to get on board with. It removes all jeopardy from the story if you get me? And it also would be a completely new concept, reliving your entire life in the lifestream/your memories.

I think I much prefer that remake is a physical reality in which there is real jeopardy to the planet and the Zack scenes are him in a bit of a Sixth Sense phase (like many others following the S7 plate drop).

Telling the story of Zack and these others in this half-way state could culminate in Aeris joining them and us seeing the events of 'on a way to a smile' in the game. Eg culminating in all these lost souls finally accepting their fate and coming together at the end to help Holy defeat Meteor.
                >It removes all jeopardy from the story if you get me? And it also would be a completely new concept, reliving your entire life in the lifestream/your memories.

I've actually tweaked my theory on that. I'm now with the idea that Sephiroth has simply just corrupted their memories.

When a person dies their consciousness continues in the lifestream for a small amount of time before return to the planet, we know that to be true, within the consciousness is the memory, when a person becomes one with the planet their memory is retained while their consciousness is lost, this means they are separate entities to the planet, and messing with memory is Jenova 101.

I actually think it makes more sense Sephiroth would try to win from inside the lifestream having consistently failed on the surface.
                    Yeah but how would it play out that Sephiroth messing with Cloud's memories in the lifestream would result in him 'winning' and physically controlling the entire planet and its lifestream? That's the jeopardy I'm missing in the theory.

I think for storytelling purposes there has to be a *simple* jeopardy at play. Sounds a bit too convoluted at the moment to be the main purpose of remake if you get me? Eg its alot easier to understand 'Seph's fucking with the past to have another bite at the cherry' than 'he's messing with Cloud's memories that actually for some reason magically gives him an 'in' at controlling the entire planet'.

Unless of course Gaia exists on a physical cycle/loop of life that replays exactly each time but this 'replaying of exact events' is fulfilled through use of the lifestream's past memories. So by tampering with key memories Sephiroth is effectively orchestrating the next cycle to be different. The whispers would then represent soul's who's memories are getting affected/split/out of sync due to the changes, hence why they're fight to keep things on track - because to them thats how it should be.

I know this has already been thought up but the missing part is the mechanics of it (and how events play out identical each time). We're saying this is through the lifestreams memory. So in a way this aligns with alot of the principles of your theory, that Sephiroth is tainting Cloud's memories, orchestrating the next cycle (which is remake). This would at least put the physical world in jeopardy and also explain/align with the presence and mechanic of the Harbinger, which for all intents and purposes seems to be time-steward related. I wonder if it's the Harbinger himself who is responsible for enacting the reset each time too. So by destroying him we've undone the creation of any future loops. It remains to be seen if it's killed all the whispers though. If they are soul's with conflicting memories then they may indeed continue to appear as we continue to go off course compared to OG.

Unless of course Gaia exists on a physical cycle/loop of life that replays exactly each time but this 'replaying of exact events' is fulfilled through use of the lifestream's past memories. So by tampering with key memories Sephiroth is effectively orchestrating the next cycle to be different. The whispers would then represent soul's who's memories are getting affected/split/out of sync due to the changes, hence why they're fight to keep things on track - because to them thats how it should be. I'd even go as far as saying the whisper that saved Barret's life would then perhaps be Barret's soul himself.

My only issue with any physical cycle/loop of life on Gaia theory is regarding the 'coming of Jenova'. She is outside of the control of Gaia, so when the loop is reset, Her body would no longer be waiting for Shinra to find as we kill it during the course of FF7. So either the entire universe is on a loop which sounds a bit farfetched for this, or its a time loop. Eg the Planet itself has invoked a Time-travel based loop itself, which cycles back physical reality on Gaia back to a point *after* Jenova fell. Eg < 2000 years ago.

Which actually now considering it could the case right? We know that the Cetra found a way to contain/trap Jenova but the details are never confirmed. I wonder if this containment/trap is actually to introduce a 2000-2500 year time loop. I know this has already been thought up but the missing part is the mechanics of it (and how events play out identical each time). We're saying this is through the lifestreams memory. So in a way this aligns with alot of the principles of your theory, that Sephiroth is tainting Cloud's memories, orchestrating the next cycle (which is remake). This would at least put the physical world in jeopardy and also explain/align with the presence and mechanic of the Harbinger, which for all intents and purposes seems to be time-steward related. I wonder if it's the Harbinger himself who is responsible for enacting the reset each time too. So by destroying him we've undone the creation of any future loops. It remains to be seen if it's killed all the whispers though. If they are soul's with conflicting memories then they may indeed continue to appear as we continue to go off course compared to OG.

Going off on a tangent, it makes me wonder, if indeed 'altering memories' is the way to effect future cycles then this potentially adds more importance to the Edge of Creation scene. "7 seconds til the end" for Cloud to do something. What if Cloud decided to alter his memory to Zack surviving? Cinematically Zack's survival scene is shown straight after edge of creation scene. It always felt that this was linked. But then this is back to 'Zack surviving timeline' theories... urgh really wish we had more info to at least have an idea of where this was going
Yeah that's what I'm rolling with, it seems so likely at this point. I can't take all the credit because I really derived it from Supersloth. As for Marle. yeah she seems like an inconsistency but I think that what's going on is that they're showing us a cross over between life and death.

 What I mean is the gold dust gives us, the player, a view of the real world with elements of the purgatory. So we see the survivors in the slums, like Marle, but we also see the purgatory elements like the plate as long as the dust is present. It's like visualized memories, Marle looks up at where the plate was remembering it's presence so that's what we see.

Edit: It also lines up with parts of FFX's Farplane concept and the Farplane itself was created based on unused concepts from FF7. So it looks like 7R will be adapting some of the cut material from the OG into it.
    Ah okay, so as the gold dust falls it acts as a curtain that gives us a temporary look at into this twilight realm. I could buy that.

Telling the story of Zack and these others in this half-way state could culminate in Aeris joining them (after her passing) and us seeing the events of 'on a way to a smile' happen in the game. Eg Aeris trying to help all these lost souls finally accepting their fate and coming together at the end to help Holy defeat Meteor. That would be a remake that truly factors in all compilation and supporting material.
        It works and fits in really well. It could be just like FF2's Dawn of Souls chapter and I could totally see that being either a DLC or sequel to Crisis Core on it's own.
            Just thinking about this a bit further, it doesn't need to be far detached from the multiple realities/science-led theories either. Are you familiar with 'Schrodingers cat'?

I wonder if this half-way realm is actually a big mistake/error? So rather than this always being what happens to lost souls who need to find their way to merging with the lifestream, instead what we did with the Harbinger in the Singularity created a Schrodingers cat paradox. So just like the cat in that example Zack is both alive and dead at the same time. Depending how this is implemented it could also be the case for all people who died thanks to whisper involvement between the time of Zack's Last Stand to the end of Remake. Potentially explaining the groggy/stupified people in the church.

This could be Nomura's way of explaining why Zack - who lets be honest, pretty much accepted his death happily in all the tellings of his last stand - Ended up not becoming one with the planet and maintaining his sentiency right up to Advent Children, and possibly beyond. Even at the end of AC it's not confirmed whether he finally dissolves into the lifestream or not.

So it's not multiple 'timelines', it is potentially a singularity/paradox event that creates this shadow realm where those who died due to whisper actions are reborn but not on the same plane of existence as the rest of humanity.
                Yes, I agree. A lot of what was considered evidence of multiple timelines applies here. I think this purgatory/singularity I an effect of Sephiroth halting the flow of souls returning to the planet. Like a pocket death universe where he's storing up souls to become a god. Much like the way Shinra uses souls to make electricity Sephiroth wants to use them to achieve his goals of eternal memory/ existence.

If Zack remains in purgatory he can't diffuse into the lifestream, and if he can't diffuse into the lifestream his memories of Sephiroth will live on into eternity. Same if Sephiroth were successful in killing Cloud, he'd be trapped in Sephiroths purgatory.
>That's an in game issue, where the sky box fails to rotate with the player correctly.

No. The skybox is a static image, not a 3D environment. It can't "rotate" to have a different plate above you as you move. There's no loading screens between Sector 5 and Sector 6, so there's no time to change to a different skybox. However, they could have just put in one of those fixed camera crouching sections or something between the sectors and changed the skybox at that point.
That was also an early version running on a developers PC, any number of things could have gone wrong to offset that between then and when the compiled the gold build.
Your first sentence kind of justifies how this seemingly huge error could have been made in the final moments of production. Too many people having input, struggling to meet deadlines etc. As unlikely as it is (and I originally thought), this appears to be what happened. I hate to plug my own thread all the time but did you see my analysis of those scenes? Marle and co. are definitely not standing in Sector 6 - they are standing in Sector 7. You can revisit those same areas, walk down the path that the children run down. Everything is identical; from the buildings, the layout, the debris, canisters lying around, everything exactly as it was post plate collapse in chapters 13 and 14. It’s not just reused assets, it’s the same exact location and you can stand there in game and check for yourself. The only thing out of place is the skybox, which is not consistent with what is seen elsewhere in the game (and the orientation of skybox and the pillar are also 180 degrees out of phase with how the buildings are oriented).

My post if you haven’t seen it already:

https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/jfohzs/ogremake_spoilers_clearing_up_some_details_of_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Edit: I do agree that people tend to favour theories that are in line with what they want the Remake series to be, even if the evidence contradicts it. All I can say is this is not the case for me. My theory for what’s going on changed about 4 times in the first month after release of Part 1, then a couple of times after that, including when I did this analysis for myself. And the scenes in Intermission also have me reconsidering everything yet again. I’m not set on any particular theory, I am just changing my view as more evidence is laid out and analysis done on it.
    I read your post, and your analysis is sound. 

I don't disagree that there's something fishy going on with the skybox -- I just think it's intentional, and they're telling us something about how things are different post-whisper battle.

The entire scene is set up for a deliberate pan up to show the plates. But we'll see when Part 2 comes around (maybe)!
It's close in idea but I have a few differences.

The whole of Remake is Clouds memory in the lifestream (besides Zacks scenes) being corrupted by Sephiroth, so everyone we meet besides Red XIII and Marlene is already dead, its just Clouds memory of them.

Zacks scenes are his memory in the lifestream being corrupted by Sephiroth, so all the different details like Midgar and Stamp are his memory.

The ending of both games then presents a different area, close to what November is describing, a manifestation of the planets collective memory where the conscious of those not yet dissipated into the lifestream exist, but its been changed due to Sephiroths influence with the harbinger. Zacks scene is a part of that.

I'm still 50/50 on the last part, the end of Remake might be Clouds memory having been messed up, while the end of intermission is Zacks consciousness in the lifestream wondering the planet like Elmyras husband.

Who'd have thought a year ago its November who's theories I most line up with haha, although I think it was he who made the memory theory which got me to look at things from a different perspective.
    Yeah I think the 'whole of remake is Cloud's memory' is the hardest for me to get on board with. It removes all jeopardy from the story if you get me? And it also would be a completely new concept, reliving your entire life in the lifestream/your memories.

I think I much prefer that remake is a physical reality in which there is real jeopardy to the planet and the Zack scenes are him in a bit of a Sixth Sense phase (like many others following the S7 plate drop).

Telling the story of Zack and these others in this half-way state could culminate in Aeris joining them and us seeing the events of 'on a way to a smile' in the game. Eg culminating in all these lost souls finally accepting their fate and coming together at the end to help Holy defeat Meteor.
        >It removes all jeopardy from the story if you get me? And it also would be a completely new concept, reliving your entire life in the lifestream/your memories.

I've actually tweaked my theory on that. I'm now with the idea that Sephiroth has simply just corrupted their memories.

When a person dies their consciousness continues in the lifestream for a small amount of time before return to the planet, we know that to be true, within the consciousness is the memory, when a person becomes one with the planet their memory is retained while their consciousness is lost, this means they are separate entities to the planet, and messing with memory is Jenova 101.

I actually think it makes more sense Sephiroth would try to win from inside the lifestream having consistently failed on the surface.
            Yeah but how would it play out that Sephiroth messing with Cloud's memories in the lifestream would result in him 'winning' and physically controlling the entire planet and its lifestream? That's the jeopardy I'm missing in the theory.

I think for storytelling purposes there has to be a *simple* jeopardy at play. Sounds a bit too convoluted at the moment to be the main purpose of remake if you get me? Eg its alot easier to understand 'Seph's fucking with the past to have another bite at the cherry' than 'he's messing with Cloud's memories that actually for some reason magically gives him an 'in' at controlling the entire planet'.

Unless of course Gaia exists on a physical cycle/loop of life that replays exactly each time but this 'replaying of exact events' is fulfilled through use of the lifestream's past memories. So by tampering with key memories Sephiroth is effectively orchestrating the next cycle to be different. The whispers would then represent soul's who's memories are getting affected/split/out of sync due to the changes, hence why they're fight to keep things on track - because to them thats how it should be. I'd even go as far as saying the whisper that saved Barret's life would then perhaps be Barret's soul himself.

Which actually now considering it could the case right? We know that the Cetra found a way to contain/trap Jenova but the details are never confirmed. I wonder if this containment/trap is actually to introduce a 2000-2500 year time loop. I know this has already been thought up but the missing part is the mechanics of it (and how events play out identical each time). We're saying this is through the lifestreams memory. So in a way this aligns with alot of the principles of your theory, that Sephiroth is tainting Cloud's memories, orchestrating the next cycle (which is remake). This would at least put the physical world in jeopardy and also explain/align with the presence and mechanic of the Harbinger, which for all intents and purposes seems to be time-steward related. I wonder if it's the Harbinger himself who is responsible for enacting the reset each time too. So by destroying him we've undone the creation of any future loops. It remains to be seen if it's killed all the whispers though. If they are soul's with conflicting memories then they may indeed continue to appear as we continue to go off course compared to OG.

Going off on a tangent, it makes me wonder, if indeed 'altering memories' is the way to effect future cycles then this potentially adds more importance to the Edge of Creation scene. "7 seconds til the end" for Cloud to do something. What if Cloud decided to alter his memory to Zack surviving? Cinematically Zack's survival scene is shown straight after edge of creation scene. It always felt that this was linked. But then this is back to 'Zack surviving timeline' theories... urgh really wish we had more info to at least have an idea of where this was going
Yes, I agree. A lot of what was considered evidence of multiple timelines applies here. I think this purgatory/singularity I an effect of Sephiroth halting the flow of souls returning to the planet. Like a pocket death universe where he's storing up souls to become a god. Much like the way Shinra uses souls to make electricity Sephiroth wants to use them to achieve his goals of eternal memory/ existence.

If Zack remains in purgatory he can't diffuse into the lifestream, and if he can't diffuse into the lifestream his memories of Sephiroth will live on into eternity. Same if Sephiroth were successful in killing Cloud, he'd be trapped in Sephiroths purgatory.
