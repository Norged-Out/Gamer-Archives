[[Is Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade just Final Fantasy VII Remake With More Stuff and Better Graphics]]


Hello, people of reddit. I'm new to the Final Fantasy games, and I recently started playing FFVII and the remake of it. But I saw that Intergrade came out and i'm a bit confused, because I've heard it's a sequel to the FFVII Remake or that it's just a better version of the FFVII Remake with more content. Can someone tell me what the difference between Intergrade and the original remake is? Thanks!


Intergrade is the enhanced PS5/PC version of FF7Remake. It also has the Episode Intermission Yuffie DLC
Intergrade is the ps5 version of the game.

Intermission is the added DLC
What platform are you playing on, ps4 or 5? FF7 Remake is the ps4 version. Intergrade is the ps5 version that is also on pc and it has better grafics and a great separated story Dlc, otherwise it's the same game.Â 
Thank you all for telling me the difference!
Intergrade is the PS5 version
