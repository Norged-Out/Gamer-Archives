Man the trailers and pictures really did this upgrade no justice. On PS5 it is incredible. The lighting, textures, and 60 FPS really complete this game and take it to the next level.
    I agree it looks amazing, but in saying that the PS4 release was already one of the best looking PS4 games out there. I think it's a testament to how well they did on PS4 in the first place, and that allowed them to give us this awesome PS5 version a year later.
    Be nice if I could actually more than 5
Minutes of it before it freezes....
        I haven‚Äôt had one yet. You on PS5?
            Yes - I can't even load from my transferred PS4 save file. The game just freezes the on the PS5. It's frustrating as hell. I've reinstalled the PS5 operating system and both games multiple times and same result. 

I can play the PS4 version no problem on the PS5
                That‚Äôs weird. That said, I haven‚Äôt tried a save file I just started a whole new game to experience the 60fps from the beginning in all its glory.
                    I'm jealous! It's frustrating knowing I have everything I need but it's just not working.
                        That sucks, I've finished the DLC chapters and a couple of the main story chapters and haven't had a single bug, crash or even a frame drop from what I can tell.
                            I'm jealous! I've even gone as far as replacing the PS5 disk for a new one at the store same issue. I think my 2 week old PS5 is a dud.
    Literally booted up and just how it looks? Amazing. No justice done from the trailers
        It‚Äôs unreal. The aftermath portion of the first reactor blowing up where you are working your way back to seventh heaven, my jaw was on the floor with how good it looked.
    Totally agreed. I obviously knew it would look better, but I was not prepared for the level of improvement. Everything looks so much better and runs so much smoother. This is a legitimately incredible update.
I have been excited for months to play this game in 4K, but as soon as it loaded up in 60 FPS that all went out the window. This game is so cinematically gorgeous and buttery smooth at 60 FPS that I don't give a damn about the resolution anymore. I decided to start a fresh file and replay the whole game this way before starting Yuffie's DLC.
    I'm surprised how well the game looks in performance mode. Can't tell much of a difference so I think I'll stick with the the 6p fps like I did for demon's souls.
    I have a great tv with fantastic motion interpolation settings that smoothed out the originals experience...but for some reason, I can't get the same results right now with the 4k mode. 

Either that, or in the face of an *actual* 60fps experience, I just notice the micro stutters wayyy more with the motion interpolation.  Black frame insertion did a good job....but it darkens the image.  

And with how bright and beautiful this game is at 1620p/60fps, I just don't see the benefit of 4k/30.   All I notice is juddering which kills the added detail.
    In the same boat! I've been eager to replay this game but waited for Yuffie's content. I realized I never got all the summons in my previous playthrough too, so there's a lot to dig into
The new ending got leaked on YouTube. It's amazing ü§©
    I won't watch it, but I gotta know: Is it a new / extended ending for the base game or is it after Yuffies DLC?
        Base game, post credits.
            If its the one with the party then its on both it seems, because its definitely the ending to Intermission as well.
            thanks, gotta replay it then
        Nope, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúsecret ending‚Äù for Yuffie‚Äôs DLC ending.
    There's a new ending past the Sephiroth fight? Any idea how much it adds past that? Looks like I'll have to do another full run here.
        https://youtu.be/F0sPSgHcURU
            Oh I got that ending in Intermission tho. I think you get the ending in both Intergrade and Intermission
                I finished a base game before, but didn‚Äôt see it.
            wtf. I was completely expecting a rickroll.
When discussing Tifa‚Äôs outfit, they changed ‚Äúsomething mature‚Äù to ‚Äúsomething refined‚Äù. Anyone notice any other dialogue changes?

Edit: Wait did they take out Aerith saying ‚Äúshit‚Äù??
    > Edit: Wait did they take out Aerith saying ‚Äúshit‚Äù??

Man, this would annoy me. That came out of the blue for me and I LOVED it. Don't remove it!
        I liked it too, but I can see how they might want it to be closer to the original Japanese, where she just makes a surprised sound rather than anything like a ‚Äúcurse word.‚Äù Cursing is culturally very different in Japanese anyway, so who knows.
    But... it is a mature dress, not a refined one. If anything, the "sporty" dress could be called refined.
        Yeah I hear you, the only thing I can think of is maybe they thought ‚Äúmature‚Äù sounded too sexy or something? I dunno. I thought it was ok.
            In Intermission there is a dialogue about Wall Market being "mature" and "adult" to explain it to an underage so maybe they wanted not to mix these words with Tifa picking an outfit?
    Yup. There's still swearing in the Yuffie episodes. I haven't replayed the base game but all the blue language should still be there.
Anybody tried Classic (normal) mode? I turned it on as I want to replay this with classic mode since I already did a playthrough with active but... it seems like it does nothing at all? My character doesn't attack, doesn't do anything (just playing through Chapter 1 now) and I have to mash square button to attack and I can move around on my own like normal non-classic. Am I missing something?

EDIT: Actually nevermind, I just got Barrett now as my first party member and the classic option is working as intended (auto-attacking, etc). I wonder if it's a bug/not working just when you have Cloud solo in the tutorial.
    I'm trying out Normal Classic. I'm tending to override the controls pretty often. Battles just go too slow.
Anyone else realise the Sephiroth / One Winged Angel section of the intro was different than what it was in the PS4 version?
    The whole intro music piece felt a bit different but most noticeable during the One Winged Angel part which is much more subtle than the original, - the bass drums during the pullout are more muted too.

IMO SFX in the game is toned down as well, wonder if they tried to integrate Tempest and it just didn't take.
        Maybe it's just the VO but Sonon sounded incredibly quite in the game, even after I turned music down. Yuffie sounds just fine but in gameplay without subs I wouldn't know what he was saying.
    Yea, I noticed that, too. Couldn't make out the lyrics. Makes me wonder if there's even more differences in the music or even scenes.
So intermission is dlc and intergrade the ps5 version? I'm assuming I would play the game first, so how many hours to complete the game on average?
    Yeah, Intermission is the Yuffie DLC and Intergrade is the name given to the PS5 version.

The regular game will take you 25-35 hours depending on whether you rush or not. It's a pretty lengthy campaign and I've heard Intermission is another 5-6 hours on top of that.
        I just clocked in 10 hours with all side quests done :) it's amazing btw
            Yeah 9 hours for me to do the same. I'll do a hard playthrough as well to get the trophies and because yes it is fucking amazing haha. 

Even if you just do a 9-10 normal playthrough, it is incredible value for $20. Not just in terms of time, but also the content and the characters. Yuffie is so much fun to play, and I hope Part 2 keeps the synergy attacks with party members. A bit like the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games, each combination of party members could have a unique synergy attack.
My intermission dlc from the US PSN store says chinese/korean version? Anyone can confirm?

Edit: on the singapore psn store, theres 2 versions of the intermission dlc, eng/jap and chi/kor. But on the US store, it appears to just be 1 version
    Chinese version works fine and is in English for me.
        Thabk you for the confirmation!! Im still downloading the main game!
    I‚Äôm seeing the same thing and can‚Äôt find an English version anywhere
        I purchased so quickly without checking. Fml. Hoping its a title error and its in fact english.
            Also, launching from the in-game tab brings you to the same product page so I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs an error
            Same. I'm hoping it was an error too. A little worried, but it makes no sense if that's the only version available if you're not on a Chinese/Korean PSN. 

I'm in the US.
            Also seeing the same thing. Hoping someone can confirm what's going on there :/
            Yeah, let me know if it‚Äôs correct once you jump in!
                It‚Äôs fine and in English playing now
    I'm seeing this also.
    Same and I dont know why, gonna wait on downloading I guess just in case
People on Twitter are saying that the DLC language is still English regardless of label

Edit: I can confirm it is myself, playing now.
    Assuming you're talking about the language audio, you just need to reset the game for it to take effect.
This game was made unnecessarily confusing to download.
    Typical of Japan
Hey does anyone know at what point in the story does the intermission dlc start at? Like in between which normal chapters should I play the intermission?
    According to the trailers it was after cloud fell from the sector 5 reactor and before tifa goes to see Don Corneo
        Thanks!
    You can automatically start it by pressing r2 at the title screen
[deleted]
    Yea, I noticed this too. I'm hoping Digital Foundry does a video covering FF7R Intergrade, I'd love to see comparisons and all that
        [deleted]
            Awesome, thank you!
    I'm with you there, I noticed the hitching. Those who had the physical ps5 version didn't get a patch though? If there is a patch that is. 

Either way, the 60fps mode looks like a dream. and I love the new sound mix, it feels more layered and 3D. I watched chapters 1-3 and there's a lot of new npc dialogue/banter between Cloud, Tifa and Barret  nothing story altering but I believe it adds to the world building and I very much liked it. 

Npc faces especially in the shops on chapter 3 were noticably better and more animated way less wooden. All the textures look Great and heavily updated

The one thing I'm itching to see is If they keep using that same repeated neighborhood watch/avalanche NPC that's really sticks out during the sector seven plate. The guy with the vest is on the pillar with Barrett and on the ground In the slums when aerith gets there. It's a small gripe but I'd like to see if it was changed.
        [deleted]
            Yeah even though Im gonna play tonight and don't work the rest of the week I couldn't help myself from surfing around and finding all the little things to spoil myself,   as funny as it is to say I saw the trash and the trash looked good!
    I was initially planning to play in 60fps mode, but I‚Äôm shocked at how good the game looks at 4K. I‚Äôve been using that and taking a LOT of pictures with photo mode lol
        Same here. 60fps is nice, but I find the 30fps smooth enough and has a more cinematic feel to it. The native 4k though is breathtaking, such a sharp image.
    Maybe I just don't pay attention, but I didn't notice any frame drops in my time with the game so far.
Downloading now in UK, hype hype hype
    wtf its not showing up for me at all. the upgrade version that is. yuffie dlc is unavailable until i have the upgrade which is not showing up at all. almost 1am here now uk time.
        Go to PSN store > FF7 product page > click the 3 dots > select upgrade option
            yeh thx, but i did that. for some reason it didn't show up for me at all until around 3 am
    Did you manage to upgrade from disc version?

I have the PS4 disc version, I put it in my drive last night (Japan here), I used my JP account and it let me buy the PS5 upgrade, so I could download it overnight. However all my saved games are in my Irish account, so I woke up this morning expecting I'd be able to convert it on my Irish account too but it says "You need to own the disc version of the game to upgrade" despite me having the disc literally in the drive right now.
        Yeah I upgraded from PS4 version, I don‚Äôt know how it works with different accounts.  Have you tried logging into using your Irish account and downloading it?
            Yeah I'm logged into my irish account right now. Did you have the digital version *also* from the PSN monthly game? Because I have both (PS4 disc and PS4 digital monthly game) and it says "you are not eligible for the free upgrade to PS5 if you have obtained the game via PSN monthly"... :/ My Japanese account doesn't have PSN so that wasn't a problem but I'm worried it won't let me upgrade the Irish account *because* I have it on PSN.
                Nope, I only have physical.  I‚Äôd suggest you delete the PS+ one and try downloading it again
                    I've deleted all the PS4 versions of the game from my console (I only have the PS5 version I downloaded last night, and when I launch it it says "you need to buy this game first"). Is there a way to permanently delete a game from my PSN digital library as well?
                        Go to the game itself and click the 3 dots, make sure you select the right version and then see what happens
The 60fps mode and fast loading is like a revelation in how great it feels as well as the improved lighting. My main gripe though minor as it is, is how incredibly poor the photo mode is. You can barely move the camera or zoom it in or out, and trying to take cool combat photos ends up auto-hiding the bosses or enemies when you try to get good close-ups which sucks.
    It takes longer to press x on the main menu and then x again to continue game than it does to load a save. It‚Äôs mind blowing. I love there being no load times between chapters too
    The lighting in original PS1 FF7 was so colorful and dynamic. The improved lighting in Intergrade makes the game feel even more true to the original and I love that.
    I'm with you in the short comings of the photo mode. I hate how when you aim for a full body shot it goes above Yuffie's knees, but gives her way too much headroom. The only way to get a good angle is to pull your angle of view way out.

Also no depth of field settings so everything's quite flat. Was looking forward to the photo mode more than the 60fps.
Can anyone confirm if the trail in the Shinra building is the same or was it replaced with blood now?
Extremely minor enhancement: the terrible transition from the weapon upgrade crystarium back to gameplay has been smoothed out and isn‚Äôt super sudden and harsh anymore.
    Biggest change for me holy fuck get me a PS5 now I dreaded that animation
any estimates of when the free upgrade (ps4 disc) will be available? will it be around midnight or just some random time

edit: EST it is live!
    Midnight local time

Edit: Seems to be local by country so if you're in US it's midnight eastern time
        Product page has a countdown for midnight EST. Is it wrong? I'm seeing 9pm PST

Edit - https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA01903_00-5827003902180177
            It must be local by country then. People in AUS, JAP, etc. are already playing
            That's the same time
                Yeah I'm saying it's not midnight local
                    I'm guessing local by country? So US defaults to EST, but European countries, Asian countries, etc. Use their local time (or at least one of their timezones).

Pulling that out of my add though.
                        Think you're right because people are posting from other countries that it's out
            Yeah, it'll be 9pm PST or midnight EST. I'm in Texas so it should unlock around 11 PM for me.
                That's what I was thinking. Saying midnight local is only true if you're in EST.
    What free upgrade?
        free upgrade to the ps5 intergrade version. it does _not_ include the yuffie dlc though
            So the Yuffie DLC... I haven't seen that on the store at all and was wondering if that's coning up tonight. Do you know anything about that perhaps?
                yea it should be coming up, but it'll cost $20 by itself
                    Just had a look on the store during my break and saw that it had finally come up and that Intergrade is now playable so I'll download the whole thing and check it out later!
            I know that, Im just confused cause I read something about the summons the other day being in a patch too? Haven't followed the news recently
                indeed there is! it's an item pack add-on that gives you the three summons
I know there‚Äôs a group of masochist somewhere in this world that prefer 4k30 like me 

In my LG oled it looks Amazingly sharp , I did try 60 fps but it look too blurry for my liking
    Did you play games at 7 fps on an n64? Trust me, your 4k 30 is fine. Dont let anyone say its not a good way to play.
        I <3 Star Fox SNES
    4k30 looks like I‚Äôm playing into the spider verse.
Is it just my display? I don‚Äôt remember it being this bad on the pro.
        It has a very aggressive motion blur , so until you get used to it looks weird , in my experience switching back and forth between 60 to 30 does weird stuff to your perception , just keep it a while on 30 and eventually your mind will see it fluid and smooth
            Honestly, to me the FPS difference is bigger than the graphics difference so I‚Äôm keeping performance haha.
                I get it , for me it depends on the game , I was playing FF15 at 60 on my 1080p tv on PC , when I upgraded to my 4K tv I couldn‚Äôt stand neither 1080p blurryness or 4k30 and I ended up paying scalper prices for a 3070 

But for this and for example miles morales , 4k30 felt good , specially since I do love my crispy pixels
                    I played miles on 4K 30 and I don‚Äôt remember it looking this bad? But like you said it must be the smoothing.
        Definitely have the same experience in terms of the 30fps mode being *very noticeable* in terms of it's choppiness.  With interpolation on, i finally got the settings to work in a way that smoothed it out fine...but on scenes that have a lot of wires, chain link fences, lines of any kind the interpolation hiccups like crazy.

However, it's only noticeable because when you switch it to 60fps it's gone completely, and the image becomes vastly more stable.

When sitting still, 4k may look a bit sharper, but in motion you lose so much detail at 30fps that it's just better to do 1620p/60
        I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks this
        I also have 77 inch C8, and I kept switching between the graphics mode,  but I honestly couldn‚Äôt see any improvements on Graphics setting. (Which I‚Äôm actually happy about, because I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out on anything when running buttery smooth 60fps performance mode)
    Try turning on the Motion Pro option in the Picture settings when on 60 FPS mode. It lowers brightness and has a miniscule chance of introducing some minor artifacting, but it makes everything butter smooth.
    100% agreed. 60 fps is too blurry and 4K is so sharp!
After watching the new ending, I feel like they've told us inadvertently how the overworld will be handled, atleast for the start. 
Having the crew hitch-hike from Midgar to just outside of Kalm makes me think we're going to see alot more "episodic" kind of segments. Aka Kalm will be an open world city, but then when you go from Kalm to the caves, it'll probably be a cutscene, then the caves onward etc another cutscene. 

The only thing that discredits this is the side quests from the OG since alot were off of the beaten path so I could be wrong. 
But I do think atleast part 2 will see more cinematic transitions from location to location, then when you get a vehicle itll be similar to FFX style over travel when you get the airship.
    That's not what it implies at all. Not in the slightest. They get to Kalm this way for the obvious reason that Part 2 will start with the Nibelheim flashback, like most people already expected. There will absolutely be a big open area as soon as you leave Kalm.
        Will there absolutely be a big open area??? Ffxv was the last game with a giant open world and even  that wasn't huge in comparison to what ff7 offers. So don't be dissapointed if it's not open.
            I personally think it will be large hub areas, which I'm totally fine with. Open world games are usually pretty empty, I'd rather they focus on making things as dense as possible rather than as large as possible. Still with freedom to move around of course
                Nomura directly stated in the First Soldier livestream that in Part 2, Cloud would be running through wide, natural areas. So it would most definitely be open world, though the story might be linear like in OG. Plus I feel like we should have faith in the devs, they seem to know what fans would like to see for FFVIIR and open world is the highest on the wishlist.
For anyone like me that downloaded the free ps+ so they didn't need to use the disc for a while, you can still insert your disc with that version installed and upgrade to Intergrade. It does not conflict with this version of the game.
    Delete the digital version from your system; insert disc, should then give you access on the store
        I didn't even have to dok that, but good for those having potential issues yeah.
I can't beat Ramuh, I can't even beat a Wrath Hound in the junk yard.

What am I doing wrong? Am I supposed to wait til I get more party members for Ramuh?
    OK I beat Wrath Hound solo by keeping pressuring with close combat and physical attack skill. Can't let down for a moment.

Ramuh Stull destroys me.
    Wrong thread. This is for Intergrade. Not Intermission.
        Ah, shit. Thanks.
I'm loving it so far but i feel like yuffie and Sonon are squishy compared to how i feel as cloud. i get hit once and my screen is red.
Awh man I wanted to do a poll to see if people are gonna play on Performance Mode or Graphics Mode ):
    I think I'm going with Performance, since I'm on a 1080p TV, but I'm wondering if the graphics mode has improvements besides resolution.
    I'm personally going for graphics, I really only pick frame rate if it's first person or combat intensive like Ghost of Tsushima or a hardcore action rpg.
[deleted]
    Yeah they are but not much. I noticed the triggers on the bike section in chapter4. Also there is a little bit of haptic vibrations on Dualsense in combat compared to the old vibrations on the DualShock 4.But it could jsut be the controller just has better vibrations overall anyway. Hard to tell, Pretty basic but appreciated.
    Nope
Anyone else‚Äôs FMVs really choppy in the ps5 version? PS4 was silky smooth during opening scene, intergrade really choppy.
    Did you wait til the game was fully downloaded/installed? Or did you start playing as soon as it was "playable?"
        Playable, which is probably why
    Not having this issue yet.
Anybody know if you still need the PS4 disc data installed and the disc in after downloading the ps5 free version? 

Edit: You need the ps4 play disc in, but you can delete the actual 86gb content! Just took the chance and tried it!
    Also wanna know this. That shit takes up A LOT of space on the small ass drive.
        [removed]
            Shouldn‚Äôt that be small-ass drive? Stupid bot. what‚Äôs an ass-drive? Lol

downloading the upgrade. waiting to see what happens with this chinese/korean version before i buy this DLC. sucks, cause i was hoping to play tonight (i have fast internet)
    It‚Äôs in English and works. Source, myself playing it right now.
        yeah, it does work! i played about 30 minutes, going to bed now
Is the Cacstar worth $10? What does it do as a weapon?
    The weapon ability damages all enemies in chain so it's nice plus it has a pretty good and balanced ability tree
I‚Äôm about to start replaying the game now on my PS5. Can anyone who has played the DLC recommend a good time eg which chapter I should play the Yuffie portion so that it fits in with the timing of the main campaign? I don‚Äôt want to rush into it, since I haven‚Äôt played the game in a year. Appreciate any advice!
    Honestly it should be played after the main campaign. It‚Äôs pegged as an Intermission between VII Remake and the next game. Think of it like MGS3 where it‚Äôs set before MGS1 but it‚Äôs still best to play after MGS2.
        I can‚Äôt wait that long Jack! Haha
            You could always do what I‚Äôm gonna do. Play Intermission, then VII Remake; then Intermission again. XD
                Clever!
    Do chapter 1 of Yuffies DLC once you get to chapter 8 of the main game.

Then do chapter 2 of Yuffie after chapter 12. Then make sure to skip the final cutscene after Yuffies credits then complete the main game (the cutscene seemingly plays at the end of both Yuffie and the main games completion).
    It takes place throughout Chapters 8-12.
        Thanks!
Is anyone else finding the Shinra Box Buster SOLDIER Challenge seriously difficult? I can‚Äôt manage to get my score up to 30000, let alone anywhere near 50000! Let me know if you‚Äôve found a recipe for success, I‚Äôm stumped.
    There‚Äôs a hidden time box just behind you at the start. That‚Äôs a little help.
        Ohh sneaky. Hehehe.
How do I get the secret combat simulator fight?
    IIRC you have to do all of the colosseum and Shinra combat sims. And there are some that can only be done on hard mode.
        I‚Äôve finished them all on my last play through. Went there and saw no new ones.
            > To unlock the final 5-round battle, you‚Äôll have to complete all Colosseum battles, all Shinra Combat Simulator battles, and all Battle Intel challenges.

> The Top Secret challenge is only available in Hard Mode ‚Äî Hard Mode and the Hojo‚Äôs Lab Battle Simulator both unlock after completing the game.

Got this off a site
                That's how to unlock the final simulator fight in the original game. Intergrade's stats page counts a new one, with a new enemy intel.

I am also wondering how to unlock it. I've been googling for like 40 minutes, and this is the only comment I've seen of anyone even talking about it.
                    Gotcha. Well I guess I'm not sure then.
                        I'm guessing you'd need to beat Intermission, and it'll unlock, since that's the only thing left to do if you've got all the others unlocked and beaten
                            I'll have to wait to test the theory. I'm working through Intergrade first.
                            If you're talking about the extra fights in Intermission I got them by starting chapter 2 on hard mode (once you've beat the game the first time.)
                                No, the stats in the main game count an extra fight and enemy intel
The vocals to the intro of the game are different now? I wonder why they changed them, the song overall actually sounds a bit different

Even when the logo comes in, its a bit off sync with the music when compared to the ps4 version
Can we discuss spoilers here? Because I wanna say something about the ending that I think makes the next part with a certain character better imo. If not, I'll cover it don't worry.

Spoiler:

>!So, by the end Zack comes back to the church. To preface btw, I'm currently watching Max Dood's stream, and what I'm about to say is going on top of his theory. I basically think Max is right, that Aerith is dead in Zack's timeline already. It makes sense for Zack's motivations going forward. Zack, as far as he knows, thinks Sephiroth is still dead. The only motivation Zack had in Crisis Core after the Nibelheim incident is stop Genesis and come back to Aerith. The thing that never made sense to me in the earlier theories when the Remake first came out is that Zack is also gonna stop Sephiroth in his timeline. He doesn't know Sephiroth is still alive, how would he know? I may be wrong, but I don't think Zack has JENOVA in him like Cloud right? How would Zack know? And if he doesn't know, why would he be motivated to get Sephiroth? Well now with this ending in Intermission, Zack now has motivation: to know how and why Aerith died. That's smart, I believe. It's a big motivation for Zack's character, he loved her, that's about as big as motivations get.!<
    So they're really trying to push the alternate timeline
        Yeah. I'm personally ok with it. I like Zack, he's the best thing about Crisis Core, and why Crisis Core is the best out of all the compilation games.
    Every Soldier has Jenova cells. They just aren‚Äôt susceptible to her or Sephiroth‚Äôs control. 

So, yeah, for all intents and purposes, it ends up being the same.
I've been reading through comments and theories for a while on how people think the story will play out, and I'm starting to believe that it will stay true to the OG.

So far, from the ending of Remake, we see Zack facing off against Shinra's army, an explosion go off, and him seemingly winning the fight. He's pretty roughed up from it and has blood on his clothes. The next time we see him is walking towards Midgar with Cloud, still roughed up and covered in blood, at the end of remake.

In the new ending, he doesn't have any blood or cuts on him or his clothes. He goes into the church and is confused at the people he's seeing inside, who don't seem to notice him, and are in mourning. 

As far as the people in the church mourning, I think there could be a few explanations. I think we might learn what aerith meant when she says the church has a certain power to it. We've been told that characters believe someone's consciousness could become stuck in the lifestream too, like with Jessie's dad.

Long story short, I don't think our party will physically run into Zack. I do believe that later in the game we'll be set up for a much more encompassing story that makes use of today's tech, where OG relied on text for a lot of their interactions.
    I would hope the party doesn't run into Zack cuz it wouldn't make any sense at all. He was also holding the buster sword that cloud obviously has, so it's safe to assume Zack is dead.
    I already have my theory which doesn't deviate from the og with all these scenes but instead deppens it. Like Sephirot, Zack will may have overwritten his death because he had this porpuse of helping cloud and apologize to Aerith. Or maybe people injected with jenovah cannot diffuse into lifestream as long as Sephirot will persist
I feel a bit dumb for asking this, but how the hell can I change the elemental affinity of Yuffie's Elemental Ninjutsu? The tutorial says that I'll just have to use the left and right arrow buttons, but this doesn't seem to do anything.
    You have to use the ability command then use right and left to select the ninjutsu command fire/ice/aero/lighting ninjutsu
        Oh I have to do it through the command menu? Somehow the tutorial did not quite make this clear. Thank you.
Holy shit Zack is back

Edit: why in the world would anyone downvote this? This is a spoiler-friendly thread.
    Yeah that's the whole reason I came to this thread. To discuss the ending.
        ...what else would you want to discuss?
            Literally just the ending. It left me confused
    [deleted]
        Alternate timeline shit I assume. Can‚Äôt wait for it to make sense once Part 2 is out.
        Potentially geostigma introduction???
Ummm anyone else's FF7R trophies disappear after getting the ps5 version?
    There should be two separate trophy lists, one for the PS4 and PS5 version respectively. So it might look like your trophies are gone, but that‚Äôs actually a second list.
        oooh ok phew. but if i replay this game on the ps5, does that mean it'll unlock it on the ps5 trophy list then?
            If you replay the PS5 version of the game on PS5 then it‚Äôll unlock these new PS5 version trophies.

If you‚Äôve already played the PS4 version, what you could do is download the PS4 version again (just the first 10GB or so till you can start it) then from the PS4 version you can upload your game save. Then go to the PS5 version of the game and download those game saves (this is all done from the FF7R main menu) and then all the trophies you earned from the PS4 version will suddenly unlock for the PS5 trophy list! If that makes sense.
                its sorta frustrating the sony didnt make this like a more seamless process lmao. you should've seen my morning trying to figure out how to get the ps5 version and then having to get the DLC
                I loaded the cloud save through FFVII Remake and the trophies didn't pop. What am I doing wrong?
                    Did you upload the saves through the Upload save function within the PS4 version of VII Remake? It‚Äôs within the game, not PS+ Cloud saves.
                        Yes, that's what I said.
                            I‚Äôm not sure then. Should be as simple as uploading in VIIR | PS4 and then using the Download Save function in VIIR | PS5. That‚Äôs what I did.
                                I did the same thing and my save is still not showing on ps5. I retried uploading the save too. I also checked my ps5 save storage and it‚Äôs on the system itself as well but not showing up when I boot the game up. Huge bummer.
    Not me. Still shows 54 trophies.
Graphics mode looks great but aside from major texture upgrades and skybox fixes, it doesn't really blow me away, it feels like last year's PS4 release. Though, I do gotta say I really appreciate the more natural-looking lighting model, makes a huge difference in certain scenes. Disappointed that some textures seem to be perpetually low quality.

The performance mode though, holy crap. That rock-solid 60 fps is a sight to behold. The game feels so good to play now, and the cutscenes are so crisp and defined. This feels like a substantial upgrade. And it's not like the resolution is significantly reduced. It still looks sharp. 

I dunno if they touched up the HDR implementation, I always thought VII:R did a fantastic job with it but Intergrade feels like it goes a step further. Dark blacks, extremely bright highlights, this game on an OLED is magical.
    I have seen a hdr controls in the menu which I feel my tv needs as the blacks are not that dark, but yeah the hdr looks way better
my god Nayo is a waifu, giving tifa a run of her money
Does anyone have the completed ending (from the first line to the last line "Aerith") completely in Japanese? If so can you spare a link? Many of the Japanese videos I've seen stops short of the final bonus ending.
So I downloaded intermission before it showed Chinese/Korean version. That's the only one on the US PSN store I could find. 

Don't tell me I'm gonna have to buy the DLC twice -_-
    [deleted]
        Chinese version works fine and is in English. Feel free to download.
    I was just googling this cuz I did the same thing, and apparently this exact same thing happened last year when the original game came out and Sony had to offer refunds.
        This one happened to Region 3 stores which does sell the FFVIIR in chinese/korean.

Now it's happening on R1 stores which doesn't even have chinese/korean base game. I don't know what happened.
            Saw a thread on Resetera and one guy said he bit the bullet and got that version and it works fine, but I‚Äôm gonna wait until morning before I download the copy I bought.
        Sweet hell.
Why does the Yuffie DLC in the US store say ‚ÄúChinese/Korean‚Äù version after you buy it? Did someone make a fing mistake? Was it me?
    Was just wondering the same. I didn't end up buying because it said that.
        I bought it. Works fine with US version of the game
Which comes first intermission or intergrade?
I cannot purchase intergrade.
https://imgur.com/Lc3kFjx
On the ps store I see the option to upgrade to intergrade if I were to buy intermission.
.
I own the digital copy of ff7 remake
    Intermission happens across multiple chapters of Intergrade. So one doesn't really happen before the other.

Try this for the upgrade.
The way I got it for the disc version was to go to the installed game in my library, press Options, View Product, Three Dots button, then there should be an option for the upgrade.
        It doesn't allow me to purchase intergrade.  All of them that lead to intergrade just lead me to the imgur error I posted.
            How about this page?

https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA01903_00-7462776201452750
                Not available for purchase.

I think I have to wait until support opens up.  I think this issue is from the period when they offered ff7 remake for free.  I read that you cannot upgrade from that free content to intergrade.  I don't remember if I added that to the account, and now the account thinks I have that instead of the ff7 remake that I purchased.
                    The item on the right is the one you want. It looks like it's already in your library. Just have to download it now. You don't need to purchase the first two.
                        That's the ps4 to ps5 upgrade.  I downloaded 80 gigs to see if it did anything.  Nope.
                            I'm confused then. What exactly are you looking for?

You have Intergrade already in your library already. You can't purchase what you already have.
                                I thought I had to purchase intergrade.  I'm dumb.  I tried to avoid anything about intergrade to avoid spoilers, but I should have at least looked at how it gets released.
                                    Yep.

PS4 > PS5 Intergrade = free but no Yuffie DLC. 

Fresh PS5 Intergrade purchase = $70 but includes Yuffie DLC

Standalone Yuffie DLC = $20
It's interesting that other than being on console storage instead of my external hdd, Integrade has nothing to differentiate itself on the PS5 homescreen or library from the PS4 version of Remake.  

Its even listed as a Ps4 game when filtered in the library...
Can someone help me understand how to better use Yuffie's Ninjutsu attacks? I'm pressing left and right on the D pad when her throwing star is away but I can't tell which element affinity im using :/
    Wrong thread. This is for Intergrade. You want Intermission.

https://en.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/nw5ax2/intermission_complete_discussion/?
        how? i didnt finish it yet
            Intergrade is just the FF7 Remake.

Intermission is the Yuffie DLC.

You can always check the Chapter 1 thread.
Can anyone report on if they removed the hidden loading sections where Cloud is forced to squeeze through tight spaces? I hate those.
    They will likely be gone in Part 2 but there's so many of them in this game that it would be hard to rework it all.
        You're probably right in that Part 2 won't have them. Still, the fact that there is a specific PS5 version of the game made me think that they were going to make changes to accommodate the PS5 abilities. At this point, it feels like what they improved could have been done with a patch to the PS4 version.
            The intermission dlc doesn't have them, that I could notice, so that's what I'd expect for the next part. The closest thing was fences to prevent you from skipping certain fights.
    They're still in the game.
[deleted]
    Dude... Wrong thread. This is for Intergrade not Intermission.
hi, i bought the ps4 digital version last year. so, to get the ps5/intergrade, do i have to redownload that? because it won‚Äôt let me download the intergrade from the store
    It hasn't released yet, you've got a couple more minutes to wait, I believe.
        still nothing here

&#x200B;

edit : we're good
            Me neither, it is telling me I can‚Äôt get it because I already own the PS4 version
                I think you are supposed to search the psn store for ff7 remake upgrade not ff7 intergrade
                    Yep, that‚Äôs it. Good catch.
Hey guys I got the ps4 version downloaded but when I go to upgrade it says disc required
    The PS+ version doesn't upgrade for free.
        I have the original digital version
            You should be able to upgrade it by going to the page for it and clicking the three dots; I was able to without a disk.
                Yeah when I go to it it says insert disc. Idk thanks for trying to help tho i accidentally purchased it again for 69.99
[deleted]
    That's easy. Intermission is PS5 exclusive.
        [deleted]
            It wont ever be on ps4.
            I highly doubt it's coming to PS4. Series X/S and PC? Sure. but not a last gen console.
    You can't play Intermission on PS4, it's PS5 exclusive.
        [deleted]
            Final Fantasy PC ports generally suck.
                Its a bit more complex than that.

The older PC ports are pretty bad but 15 is the most recent one and 15 runs and looks better on PC than on the original ps4 version by a landslide. 

There's at least a decent chance ff7r will have a good port imo. That said, you might wait a long time as intergrade has definitely made it likely the pc port is still a long ways off.
                    The version of 15 I played on the PC had horrible hitching, even though my FPS was decent. When I read about it, it was a common issue. I can't remember if it was Steam or Windows Store
                        https://youtu.be/MWuRlgFpVIQ

Digital foundry definitely feel it's a substantial improvement
                    FF7R and FF15 do not use the same engine. FF15 uses the luminous engine. FF7R uses UE4.
                        You are totally right and I honestly don't know why I forgot this and confused myself. Edited my original comment.
Does anyone know if the gear/items/grind we do on this DLC for Yuffie carry over to the main story when part 2 comes out??  If not, what is the point?  I honestly don‚Äôt want to spend hours grinding if nothing from this transfers over for when you meet Yuffie in the main story.
    We don‚Äôt know anything about how the next game is going to work. 

The weapon grinding is probably meant for preparing for Hard Mode.
    We don't know and this is a thread for Intergrade. Not Intermission.
I'm confused, I can't upgrade? I bought the Digital Edition of Remake on PS4 when it came out last year, but now when I go Intergrade in the PS Store, it says 'you can not buy this game because you already own the following: FF7 Remake'.

Can someone help me out? Am I doing something wrong?  
Like I said, I bought the game for full price back in the day, I do - not - have the free PSN version.
    The way I got it for the disc version was to go to the installed game, press Options, View Product, Three Dots button, then there should be an option for the upgrade. 

At least IIRC that's how it worked.
        ooohhhh yes thank you, I went to the 'old' FF7 Remake in the store and there it had an 'upgrade' button.

Duh, I'm an idiot, thank you :D
Ok so I'm confused? What exactly is Intergrade? Like I got the ps4->ps5 free upgrade but not the yuffie dlc yet. Is Intergrade another upgrade or just the name of the whole package?
    Intergrade = PS5 version.

Intergrade purchased will have the Yuffie dlc included.

Intergrade as the free PS4 > PS5 upgrade has no Yuffie dlc.

Yuffie DLC is $20.
        Gotcha thanks
    Intergrade is just the name of the pack in the store that contains the VIIR PS5 version and Intermission.
        Gotcha thanks
Gotta say, that it sucks that this is only available on the PS5.  Haven't been able to get my hands on one due to scalpers. That and a large amount of expenses have popped up.
I'm not sure I like the Weiss boss fight at the moment and I think if they keep going in that direction in the later parts it will not be a good thing. In my personal opinion it feels like it is veering too much toward the ACTION part of being an ARPG and kind of is at odds with the rest of the game and its mechanics, in that for this in particular you seem to be required to have good twitch reflexes to get him pressured.
    Weiss is very much an optional superboss type of design. I don‚Äôt think they would put something of that difficultly on the critical path in later games.
    >for this in particular you seem to be required to have good twitch reflexes to get him pressured.

Only for phase 1. And the timing isn't too strict either. (I definitely found it easier than trying to perfect guard with Yuffie consistently). It's more a matter of figuring out which direction you're supposed to dodge specific attacks. (ie: stab = dodge forward, Evisceration = dodge back, Crosswise Cleave = dodge left or right). 

Phase 2's a magic phase for your characters. Constant character switching and proper strategy is what's important here. 

For phase 3, I'm not sure there's any legit way to reliably dodge those attacks. It feels more like a survival phase even though he's very vulnerable to physical attacks here. Honestly, the best way I found through phase 3 is to save a level 2 limit for it since using one will instantly boost his stagger gauge from empty to just about full. 

But I will admit, beating him without getting good at phase 1 will definitely make the fight take a lot more time than it needs to.
Btw if u own both physical/digital copy and PS+ version, u can‚Äôt get get the free upgrade to Intergrade.. Man this is sucks üò¢

Update : free upgrade is available now, apology for worrying.
    Yes you can; just delete the digital copy and put the disc in
    You can, if you are in the US it isn't live yet
        Why does everyone with the disc copy get a countdown timer while those of us with digital just get a message saying, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt buy this bitch, you already bought the game‚Äù. I have the disc copy, but it‚Äôs unopened and will stay that way for at least another decade.
            Dude just open it and have some fun
                Even then I won‚Äôt be able to play because I can‚Äôt download the new one because I purchased the digital version. I‚Äôm hoping it unlocks at midnight EST, shouldn‚Äôt take more than a few minutes to download on my internet.

I have the physical copy so that I always have a copy of the game, no matter what. It‚Äôs tucked away for safe keeping with my PS1 copy.
                    You could just delete the digital version and install the physical, the ps4 recognizes it as two different ones.
                        It finally worked, and thankfully my internet is fast enough I was playing within 5m, fully installed in 20. You playing it? DLC is super cool.
                            I'll have to wait until its either out on ps4 or when I get the ps5 man. I saw a couple minutes and it looks really great. Have you finished it already?
            The way Sony blocks you out of buying bundles and such because you own part of it is weird and confusing
            I don't have a disc, I have a digital ps5 but I actually went to the website story page on my computer and it has a countdown timer there.
    This is sucks
    Create a new account on your ps5 and get the upgrade
60 FPS is too fast. Combat is great, but everything feels rushed. Cutscene dialog, just the overall feel is off. The game was designed with 30 FPS in mind, the original game feels the right pace. This ps5 version everything is moving too fast. Anyone else agree?
    Not really no, it's just smoother.
        R u kidding me? The conversations are over in a blink. Everything is rushed. The combat is smooth everything else is a disaster. You simply have no time to comprehend what the fuck is going on. Im shocked square would release this. A game designed around 30 FPS does not translate well to 60 FPS. PERIOD. Its like everyone is talking in fast motion and the scenes are over in a blink. This PS5 version is not enjoyable whatsoever imo. Its like they took the PS4 version and pressed fast forward X2.
            It‚Äôs literally optimized for 60fps. You just aren‚Äôt used to it. It isn‚Äôt running any faster than it does at 30fps.
                its not running any faster than 30fps? Are you on crack? the whole fucking game is sped up to 60 fps, which means everything is faster. The problem is combat and out of combat dont synce. The dumbtards at square thought that they could give us 60fps without realizing it will fuck up everything non combat. the idiots at square made a 30fps game that dont fit in a 60 fps world. they are dumb idiots. the sooner the feedback gets to them the sooner the lightbulb may possibly go off in their brains.
                    That‚Äôs not how FPS works lol. It‚Äôs running at the exact same speed at double the frames. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfaster‚Äù at all. It‚Äôs SMOOTHER. If shit‚Äôs off sync for you, then check your TV settings. That‚Äôs a you-problem.

This isn‚Äôt a KH PS4 situation. At all.
                        r u on crack? i just played it and its SHIT. 60 fps is awesome for combat, its not so awesome for the flow of the game and cutscenes that are double speed and look FUCKING REDICULOUS pardon my language, but the game has been ruined. You cant slap 4k and 60fps on top of a 2k 30fps designed game and think you can get away with it. the pacing in the ps5 version is HORENDOUS.
                            You‚Äôre the one on crack mate. The conversations and out of combat scenes are the exact same length of time. It just plays more frames in that time, hence 60fps.

The only thing it could be is your getting a similar effect as the ‚Äòsoap opera effect‚Äô when tv‚Äôs have motion stuff on. Check if your TV had that stuff on then turn it off
                                yea which means its FASTER. The scenes outside of combat ARE FASTER which means the 60 fps is ruining the original flow of the game. I played the new version, i could barely read the convos before it moved on. ITS TOO FAST. Combat at 60 fps is GREAT. The entire game at 60 fps IS NOT GREAT.
                                    No. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs faster. 1 minute at 30 FPS is the exact same as 1 minute at 60fps. It just has more frames. Making it smoother.

If what you were saying is true, the characters would sound like chipmunks and the music would be all out of whack. And all the animations would be comically funny and it would be plastered everywhere on the internet.

However you‚Äôre wrong. Not sure why you just can‚Äôt admit it rather than make yourself sound like a fool.
                                    You are really set on saying dumb stuff over and over aren't you?

Repeat after me: The game is not faster at 60 FPS.
            I think you're trolling.
                trolling what? you think im bashing the game on purpose? the fucking game is 2x fast as the ps4 version. there is no flow in the game. did you even play it?
            What are you talking about LOL
    	
I stopped using the 60 FPS mode. Most people won't notice or care but, I've noticed some effects like smoke, certain animations and lighting updating at 30 fps, maybe less.

My brain just gets easily distracted by these discrepancies as small as they are. I think most of will be fine or won't even notice. It's tough though because 60 fps combat is butter smooth.

Also some of the pre rendered cut scenes are still in 30 fps too which can be slightly awkward.
if this is a ps 5 exclusive for 6 months will it come out on ps 4 around the Holidays
    Doubt it will ever come out for the PS4.
    My guess? It won't come to PS4, but I'd like it to so more people can play it.
Cloud hair looks horrible from the back. They fixed the door but screwed Cloud‚Äôs hair.
Does anyone else feel mislead about the yuffie content 
when they said the upgrade was going to be free I assumed they meant the extra content aswell 
Was I just being stupid or was this unclear to anyone else?
    they never said the upgrade would be free, they actually made it clear the upgrade to intergrade would be free and it would allow you to then buy the yuffie dlc
    They never said the DLC was free. Just the upgrade.
    Only you are having an issue with understanding this.
Anyone know how the mirror in Chapter 3 is?
    Not a mirror.
Ah shit. I had some hope that you would be able to play the DLC without the full game installed, but nope. Naptime I guess.
Aaaand I'm downloading.
Does anyone know how to use photo mode in Yuffie's episode? Google says options + triangle but that doesn't do anything. Do I need to progress further into the game? Unlock photo mode in the main game? Or is it just not available in Intermission for whatever reason??
    Options square
    This thread is for Intergrade. Not Intermission.
    Update: options + square I'm blind lol
How much is the Digital Deluxe Upgrade after you buy INTERmission? I‚Äôm purchasing them both tomorrow.
    Looked like $20
    It‚Äôs not worth it unless you want a digital art book and mini soundtrack. The summons from the PS4 deluxe version are part of a free DLC now.
        Oh ok!
[deleted]
    wrong thread. This is for Intergrade.
Is the only difference between Graphics mode and Performance mode only 4K vs 60fps? Or does Performance mode also lose ray tracing?

I ask because according to the game menu, Graphics mode "prioritizes displaying graphics at 4K resolution".
    I don‚Äôt think FFVIIR has Ray tracing, they‚Äôre probably saving that for Part 2
        I guess I assumed it's what they meant by enhanced lighting. Well if it's purely 4K vs 60fps, then I'm sticking with 60fps.
            Good choice
    As far as I've seen and experienced, the only difference is resolution. There's no Ray Tracing in either version.
If we had FF7R digitally downloaded on PS4, do we need to keep the PS4 version of the game installed after downloading the PS5 version?
    You can delete it.
        Ok thanks!
Waiting to play is pain. It took me forty minutes to download the update and now I‚Äôm squirming while it‚Äôs loading my previous save.
    It took all but 15 seconds to import my uploaded save.
        For some reason it‚Äôs taking me ages! My internet is great otherwise but for some reason I‚Äôm still only on 40%.
    Yeah what kind of internet are you on, the save import is almost instantaneous
Has anyone else noticed that Fort Condor is just Clash Royale?
    Wrong thread. This is for Intergrade.
        Fort Condor is the mini game within Intergrade.
            Fort condor is in intermission.
                Wow....I am a moron.
                    We all have those days. It doesn't help with Square naming things like INTERgrade and INTERmission.
                        Yeah i guess i just need 238day/12...errr what were we talking about again?
                    The marketing was super weird. Most people thought the ps5 upgrade didn't have a name and the dlc was intergrade. But intergrade is actually the upgrade and yuffie is intermission
Was Cacstar included only with digital pre-orders? I just got my physical copy from EB Games and I didn't see a code anywhere for it.
    Check the receipt. They sometimes print codes on that
Also Zacks little scene... Geostigma/ alternate timeline or people from platefall looking for shelter?
Who's foot was that in the garden bed at the very end there? Was it just a random character from the original panout? Seems too obviously placed.

EDIT* Someone on YouTube commented that the flowers are a different colour to the ones cloud falls on, hinting at more alternate reality / timeline. Can anyone confirm?
So I have a two questions about Intergrade

Is there enough new content and changes that warrants a replay from the start? 

And also, If I do want to play from the start, would it be better to use the chapter selection feature from my old save data and start from chapter 1 or would it be better to just start a new game?
    Game feels and looks completely diff in 60fps. I‚Äôm replaying it and enjoying it more than the first time.
    That really depends on you. 

1. On one hand, from what I understand, there's very little new content. On the other hand, why wouldn't you want to experience it in 60fps?

2. Using your old save allows you to transfer your trophies and use your suped up characters to easily go through the game.
        Fair enough, thanks for answering.
    Can‚Äôt say new content in main game is massive. However I am amazed by the difference 60fps makes
        Yeah I dropped in on my old save data to take a quick peek and it was honestly breathtaking. Really tempted to play it again lol
I‚Äôm on a non-linear hard mode playthrough currently on the Combat Simulator in Chapter 17. I‚Äôm more than halfway through the simulator challenges. Would selecting a different hard mode chapter reset my challenges progress? I kinda wanna save Chapter 17 for last now and just finish the previous chapters I skipped in hard mode. Thanks!
    No, the only thing you need to complete a chapter for is hard mode credit, or quest progression that affects other things, such as what dresses you get and chapter 14 resolutions.
My trophies didn‚Äôt transfer for this. I loaded up my save file from ps4 and all. What gives?
    A couple of mine didn't either. I had like 43 and I'm down to 36 now.
        I platinumed ps4 but lost my save data because i didn't back it up before getting a ps5. 

Earlier in the year, I did a quick run on easy to get back to chapter selection so I can essentially redo my old save file.

I transferred that file, just with easy cleared, and all of my trophies from the old save came over, platinum and all.

The trophy system is weird.
do you return to Sector 7 after heading to the pillar? i have no idea how i'm supposed to beat Roche at Fort Condor and was hoping i would be able to return with better units/boards.
    D->V->R->D. Use the newest board you have and just build your team off what counters his troops. I was surprised how easy it all is, grandmaster battle was extremely easy too. Just don't place any troops until the opponent does and then counter. It ends when you leave sector 7, so you'll def know if you're crossing the point of no return.
    Yes and the game will warn you when you cannot return again
Anyone else having their PS5 doing a crash/shutdown while regularly playing the game?

Happened to me twice after 1 hour of play.
    It happened to me once. Scared the shit out of me.

I unplugged my ps5 and let it sit for a few minutes and plugged it back in.

Hasn't happened since. But I'm still scared it will.
        Yeah after the second I played a few other games for a long time without issue.

So shut the PS5 down over night and going to clean it today to see if that helps.

If it crashed again, am going to reinstall.
    No crashes here
Anyone know a good place to grind Yuffie and Sonon up? Beat the main story, now going for the platinum!
    Use the combat simulator imo
Which Yuffie voice sounds better to you?

Probrabbly English, but Japanese is still very impressive.
That ending.

So what‚Äôs up? Is there >!just a second cloud running around now? Are they in another timeline? If so then where‚Äôs aerith in that timeline? Personally I think it‚Äôs after sector 7 fell and he‚Äôll meet up with them, but my biggest concern is what about other cloud?!<
    I just finished intermission and have no idea what you're talking about lmao
        Same lol
        Sorry I‚Äôm talking about >!Zack at the church where he though aerith was!<
            Zacks dead. Why are you saying there's a second cloud running around?
                In Zack‚Äôs timeline, there should be another Cloud as well since they were both seen alive together at the end of the original ending.
                    Zack died in the outskirts of midgar. It doesn't make sense that he'd be holding the buster sword that cloud clearly has. I don't think we're seeing an alternate timeline, I think he's just dead and doesn't realize it.
                        Some people think he's in the lifestream, which is plausible. Another theory is that Zack surviving his battle has altered the timeline, which since the party was in the Whispers dimension when they defeated them, were unaffected by the change. So Cloud would still have the buster sword handed to him by Zack while the Zack who never died would have his. Or he's in another timeline completely, it's one of those 3 probably.
                            Why do we even have this alternate timeline/dimension thing going around? I feel like it has no bearing.
                                Because of the nature of the previous game, having the Whispers a totally non existent thing in the OG game be pretty prominent. When you bring up things like destiny and fate and changing that, people will have ideas pertaining where to go with it. No one knows where this remake is going, it'll probably follow the OG's story to a point, but Zack himself is probably the main factor on how much it does, maybe he's a ghost maybe he's not, it's all up in the air.
                                    Interesting. That's weird lol. The game is definitely not in some alternate timeline I think people are just running with the idea but only time will tell.
                                    I‚Äôm not sure how credible this is but this is from an Inverse article:

‚ÄúWe wanted to have the last boss fight take place at the highway in Midgar, which arises questions that I cannot answer," Game Director Tetsuya Nomura said in an interview featured in Final Fantasy VII Remake Ultimania. "There is a character who‚Äôs alive, which leads to a great mystery." This particular quote makes it seem like that battle had to happen on the outskirts of Midgar for some reason, and that reason is linked to "a character who's alive." Other tidbits from Ultimania claim he went missing five years ago, and he's referred to in both the past and present tense, further implying that he's MIA instead of KIA.‚Äù
                                Yeah man beats me, FFVII Remake should have been completed for the PS4, but they are milking this game, if an alternate timeline do exist the story of FFVII becomes convoluted.
                                    Ive played through the game multiple times and I just don't at all see why we're even talking about it. It's not a thing. I'm glad they're milking it. They could put it in 20, 20 hour installations and I'd gobble them all up. Ff7 freak lol

Happy cakeday, sailor.
Help please! I started a new game on my ps5 that was on the ps4 version of the game. I upgraded to the ps5 version yesterday and that file is gone. I can see it in the data on the system but it‚Äôs not loading in game.
    You have to upload it from the PS4 version. There's an "Upload Save Data" option in the main menu of the PS4 version, and a "Download Save Data" option in the main menu of the PS5 version
        Thats my problem the data is the ps4 version of the game but its on my ps5. There is no upload data option on the ps5 version for me to do that with... I was hoping that after the full game downloaded that the ps5 would recognize it but it did not work that way. I already have all of my ps4 data loaded but still missing my ps5 data from the ps4 version. so confusing I know...
            Both versions are installed on your ps5, unless you deleted the PS4 version. You have to literally start the PS4 version and upload from the main menu. The PS5 version will not automatically convert it over.
                Thank you I will see if I can do that when I get home. Didn‚Äôt think it would be two separate games. I thought it would just update over the previous game.
                    Nah. The PS5 conversions are weird like that. If you press Options on the game you can select PS4 or PS5, when you have both installed. By default the PS5 version installs alongside the PS4 version
                        You're awesome! Thanks so much!
Has anyone else noticed that at some points during battle (60FPS mode) that the game speeds up and it looks like they're moving twice as fast?
So, was there anything about Intermission that made it a PS5 exclusive?   Did they happen to use the SSD during gameplay in any way that would be remotely noticeable vs. what happened often in the PS4 game? (such as the constant shimmying).
    No use of adaptive triggers or dualsense.

No loading corridors at all though, during the entirety of Intermission, but that alone can't justify PS5 exclusivity.
        I think I felt a little something during the bike parts though. If you brake there‚Äôs a little push and then accelerating again doesn‚Äôt just give out. Then again I could be imagining it. Agreed though, still doesn‚Äôt fully  utilize the ps5 features.
    The final boss fight truly feels next gen to me. But without the technical knowledge, it‚Äôs really hard to tell if it can run on a PS4.
So the church cross in PS4 remake is white. It appears to be brown/ wood at the end of intermission and CC and maybe also AC. Can someone confirm the color on PS5 remake? Still white?
    Iup still white from a stream I saw
I had the ps4 version of FF7r. Yesterday I downloaded the ps5 version. My ps5 now has the ps4 and ps5 version of the game installed on my ssd.  From the ps4 version, I uploaded the games save data. I then switched to the ps5 version and within the games menu, chose to download the save.

Shortly after doing this my ps5 started to struggle doing anything (loading different games, joining psn parties, etc. It was very slow and seemed like it was trying to run some background process).

A few minutes later a black screen kept flickering in and out with the text "please wait". During this time I could not do anything.  The ps5 eventually shut itself off.

I then tried restarting it, before the screen to select a user renders, the black flickering screen came back and would not let me proceed forward.

I then tried to start my ps5 in safe mode and rebuild the database, while trying to rebuild the black flickering screen returned.

Eventually I said screw it and factory reset my ps5. Now everything is working fine.  I'm a little nervous and hesitant on trying to download and rerun ff7r (ps5 version) on my ps5.

Anyone else encounter something similar? :(
Can someone tell me if I already transferred my ps4 saves to ps5 with usb will that work or I still have to do it through the game

OMG finally got 100% and all the new Trophies/Platinum. Weiss was pretty tough but very rewarding to beat. FF7R is amazing and my fav. game ever, & Intergrade + Intermission only made it better! (Side note, what happened to the cute 100% crown in the Play Log?)
Why does Yuffie take so much damage from hits?
Have any of you done the Weiss VR battle what the fuck was that ending after you defeat him tho with hojo can anyone explain and share any theories
The Avalanche HQ cell here seem a tad hypocritical. ‚ÄòThe splinter cell don‚Äôt care about collateral damage‚Äô Nayo says.Yet it was Barret and crew fighting to protect the pillar and Aerith/Wedge starting the evacuation. Yuffie even said ‚Äòbe sure to warn the splinter cell‚Äô and yet there‚Äôs no evidence they warned anyone.
    I think it‚Äôs probably partially true. They may not have fought as hard if it was sector 1 for example. The fact it was their home and the people they knew probably played a role in them fighting. Plus you can‚Äôt discount their development. The Avalanche at the beginning of the game and the Avalanche at the end are very different thanks to character development.
        Yes, in the OG game, Barret and Jessie do comment that they are monsters who killed innocent people, althought, for a good cause.
Question about ninjutsu‚Ä¶is the damage of it based on the Attack stat or Magic? I want to believe magic but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I wish the intermission DLC was longer.  Going to start hard mode but felt like I barely got to level up.  

I wish there was an option after you finish to do combat simulator from Chapter 17 with Yuffie and the rest of the crew.
WTF IS THIS!? FF7 REMAKE INTERGRADE WAS WALKING BY ONE OF THE HALLWAYS JUST NOW PLAYING THE GAME AND SAW THIS. IS THIS A POSSIBLE ULTIMATE WEAPON?

>!https://ibb.co/4ph81Vx!<

>!https://ibb.co/cDF3BR5!<
Do i need to play the remake first before i play the intergrade?
I agree it looks amazing, but in saying that the PS4 release was already one of the best looking PS4 games out there. I think it's a testament to how well they did on PS4 in the first place, and that allowed them to give us this awesome PS5 version a year later.
Be nice if I could actually more than 5
Minutes of it before it freezes....
    I haven‚Äôt had one yet. You on PS5?
        Yes - I can't even load from my transferred PS4 save file. The game just freezes the on the PS5. It's frustrating as hell. I've reinstalled the PS5 operating system and both games multiple times and same result. 

I can play the PS4 version no problem on the PS5
            That‚Äôs weird. That said, I haven‚Äôt tried a save file I just started a whole new game to experience the 60fps from the beginning in all its glory.
                I'm jealous! It's frustrating knowing I have everything I need but it's just not working.
                    That sucks, I've finished the DLC chapters and a couple of the main story chapters and haven't had a single bug, crash or even a frame drop from what I can tell.
                        I'm jealous! I've even gone as far as replacing the PS5 disk for a new one at the store same issue. I think my 2 week old PS5 is a dud.
Literally booted up and just how it looks? Amazing. No justice done from the trailers
    It‚Äôs unreal. The aftermath portion of the first reactor blowing up where you are working your way back to seventh heaven, my jaw was on the floor with how good it looked.
Totally agreed. I obviously knew it would look better, but I was not prepared for the level of improvement. Everything looks so much better and runs so much smoother. This is a legitimately incredible update.
I'm surprised how well the game looks in performance mode. Can't tell much of a difference so I think I'll stick with the the 6p fps like I did for demon's souls.
I have a great tv with fantastic motion interpolation settings that smoothed out the originals experience...but for some reason, I can't get the same results right now with the 4k mode. 

Either that, or in the face of an *actual* 60fps experience, I just notice the micro stutters wayyy more with the motion interpolation.  Black frame insertion did a good job....but it darkens the image.  

And with how bright and beautiful this game is at 1620p/60fps, I just don't see the benefit of 4k/30.   All I notice is juddering which kills the added detail.
In the same boat! I've been eager to replay this game but waited for Yuffie's content. I realized I never got all the summons in my previous playthrough too, so there's a lot to dig into
I won't watch it, but I gotta know: Is it a new / extended ending for the base game or is it after Yuffies DLC?
    Base game, post credits.
        If its the one with the party then its on both it seems, because its definitely the ending to Intermission as well.
        thanks, gotta replay it then
    Nope, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúsecret ending‚Äù for Yuffie‚Äôs DLC ending.
There's a new ending past the Sephiroth fight? Any idea how much it adds past that? Looks like I'll have to do another full run here.
    https://youtu.be/F0sPSgHcURU
        Oh I got that ending in Intermission tho. I think you get the ending in both Intergrade and Intermission
            I finished a base game before, but didn‚Äôt see it.
        wtf. I was completely expecting a rickroll.
> Edit: Wait did they take out Aerith saying ‚Äúshit‚Äù??

Man, this would annoy me. That came out of the blue for me and I LOVED it. Don't remove it!
    I liked it too, but I can see how they might want it to be closer to the original Japanese, where she just makes a surprised sound rather than anything like a ‚Äúcurse word.‚Äù Cursing is culturally very different in Japanese anyway, so who knows.
But... it is a mature dress, not a refined one. If anything, the "sporty" dress could be called refined.
    Yeah I hear you, the only thing I can think of is maybe they thought ‚Äúmature‚Äù sounded too sexy or something? I dunno. I thought it was ok.
        In Intermission there is a dialogue about Wall Market being "mature" and "adult" to explain it to an underage so maybe they wanted not to mix these words with Tifa picking an outfit?
Yup. There's still swearing in the Yuffie episodes. I haven't replayed the base game but all the blue language should still be there.
I'm trying out Normal Classic. I'm tending to override the controls pretty often. Battles just go too slow.
The whole intro music piece felt a bit different but most noticeable during the One Winged Angel part which is much more subtle than the original, - the bass drums during the pullout are more muted too.

IMO SFX in the game is toned down as well, wonder if they tried to integrate Tempest and it just didn't take.
    Maybe it's just the VO but Sonon sounded incredibly quite in the game, even after I turned music down. Yuffie sounds just fine but in gameplay without subs I wouldn't know what he was saying.
Yea, I noticed that, too. Couldn't make out the lyrics. Makes me wonder if there's even more differences in the music or even scenes.
Yeah, Intermission is the Yuffie DLC and Intergrade is the name given to the PS5 version.

The regular game will take you 25-35 hours depending on whether you rush or not. It's a pretty lengthy campaign and I've heard Intermission is another 5-6 hours on top of that.
    I just clocked in 10 hours with all side quests done :) it's amazing btw
        Yeah 9 hours for me to do the same. I'll do a hard playthrough as well to get the trophies and because yes it is fucking amazing haha. 

Even if you just do a 9-10 normal playthrough, it is incredible value for $20. Not just in terms of time, but also the content and the characters. Yuffie is so much fun to play, and I hope Part 2 keeps the synergy attacks with party members. A bit like the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games, each combination of party members could have a unique synergy attack.
Chinese version works fine and is in English for me.
    Thabk you for the confirmation!! Im still downloading the main game!
I‚Äôm seeing the same thing and can‚Äôt find an English version anywhere
    I purchased so quickly without checking. Fml. Hoping its a title error and its in fact english.
        Also, launching from the in-game tab brings you to the same product page so I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs an error
        Same. I'm hoping it was an error too. A little worried, but it makes no sense if that's the only version available if you're not on a Chinese/Korean PSN. 

I'm in the US.
        Also seeing the same thing. Hoping someone can confirm what's going on there :/
        Yeah, let me know if it‚Äôs correct once you jump in!
            It‚Äôs fine and in English playing now
I'm seeing this also.
Same and I dont know why, gonna wait on downloading I guess just in case
Assuming you're talking about the language audio, you just need to reset the game for it to take effect.
Typical of Japan
According to the trailers it was after cloud fell from the sector 5 reactor and before tifa goes to see Don Corneo
    Thanks!
You can automatically start it by pressing r2 at the title screen
Yea, I noticed this too. I'm hoping Digital Foundry does a video covering FF7R Intergrade, I'd love to see comparisons and all that
    [deleted]
        Awesome, thank you!
I'm with you there, I noticed the hitching. Those who had the physical ps5 version didn't get a patch though? If there is a patch that is. 

Either way, the 60fps mode looks like a dream. and I love the new sound mix, it feels more layered and 3D. I watched chapters 1-3 and there's a lot of new npc dialogue/banter between Cloud, Tifa and Barret  nothing story altering but I believe it adds to the world building and I very much liked it. 

Npc faces especially in the shops on chapter 3 were noticably better and more animated way less wooden. All the textures look Great and heavily updated

The one thing I'm itching to see is If they keep using that same repeated neighborhood watch/avalanche NPC that's really sticks out during the sector seven plate. The guy with the vest is on the pillar with Barrett and on the ground In the slums when aerith gets there. It's a small gripe but I'd like to see if it was changed.
    [deleted]
        Yeah even though Im gonna play tonight and don't work the rest of the week I couldn't help myself from surfing around and finding all the little things to spoil myself,   as funny as it is to say I saw the trash and the trash looked good!
I was initially planning to play in 60fps mode, but I‚Äôm shocked at how good the game looks at 4K. I‚Äôve been using that and taking a LOT of pictures with photo mode lol
    Same here. 60fps is nice, but I find the 30fps smooth enough and has a more cinematic feel to it. The native 4k though is breathtaking, such a sharp image.
Maybe I just don't pay attention, but I didn't notice any frame drops in my time with the game so far.
wtf its not showing up for me at all. the upgrade version that is. yuffie dlc is unavailable until i have the upgrade which is not showing up at all. almost 1am here now uk time.
    Go to PSN store > FF7 product page > click the 3 dots > select upgrade option
        yeh thx, but i did that. for some reason it didn't show up for me at all until around 3 am
Did you manage to upgrade from disc version?

I have the PS4 disc version, I put it in my drive last night (Japan here), I used my JP account and it let me buy the PS5 upgrade, so I could download it overnight. However all my saved games are in my Irish account, so I woke up this morning expecting I'd be able to convert it on my Irish account too but it says "You need to own the disc version of the game to upgrade" despite me having the disc literally in the drive right now.
    Yeah I upgraded from PS4 version, I don‚Äôt know how it works with different accounts.  Have you tried logging into using your Irish account and downloading it?
        Yeah I'm logged into my irish account right now. Did you have the digital version *also* from the PSN monthly game? Because I have both (PS4 disc and PS4 digital monthly game) and it says "you are not eligible for the free upgrade to PS5 if you have obtained the game via PSN monthly"... :/ My Japanese account doesn't have PSN so that wasn't a problem but I'm worried it won't let me upgrade the Irish account *because* I have it on PSN.
            Nope, I only have physical.  I‚Äôd suggest you delete the PS+ one and try downloading it again
                I've deleted all the PS4 versions of the game from my console (I only have the PS5 version I downloaded last night, and when I launch it it says "you need to buy this game first"). Is there a way to permanently delete a game from my PSN digital library as well?
                    Go to the game itself and click the 3 dots, make sure you select the right version and then see what happens
It takes longer to press x on the main menu and then x again to continue game than it does to load a save. It‚Äôs mind blowing. I love there being no load times between chapters too
The lighting in original PS1 FF7 was so colorful and dynamic. The improved lighting in Intergrade makes the game feel even more true to the original and I love that.
I'm with you in the short comings of the photo mode. I hate how when you aim for a full body shot it goes above Yuffie's knees, but gives her way too much headroom. The only way to get a good angle is to pull your angle of view way out.

Also no depth of field settings so everything's quite flat. Was looking forward to the photo mode more than the 60fps.
Biggest change for me holy fuck get me a PS5 now I dreaded that animation
Midnight local time

Edit: Seems to be local by country so if you're in US it's midnight eastern time
    Product page has a countdown for midnight EST. Is it wrong? I'm seeing 9pm PST

Edit - https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA01903_00-5827003902180177
        It must be local by country then. People in AUS, JAP, etc. are already playing
        That's the same time
            Yeah I'm saying it's not midnight local
                I'm guessing local by country? So US defaults to EST, but European countries, Asian countries, etc. Use their local time (or at least one of their timezones).

Pulling that out of my add though.
                    Think you're right because people are posting from other countries that it's out
        Yeah, it'll be 9pm PST or midnight EST. I'm in Texas so it should unlock around 11 PM for me.
            That's what I was thinking. Saying midnight local is only true if you're in EST.
What free upgrade?
    free upgrade to the ps5 intergrade version. it does _not_ include the yuffie dlc though
        So the Yuffie DLC... I haven't seen that on the store at all and was wondering if that's coning up tonight. Do you know anything about that perhaps?
            yea it should be coming up, but it'll cost $20 by itself
                Just had a look on the store during my break and saw that it had finally come up and that Intergrade is now playable so I'll download the whole thing and check it out later!
        I know that, Im just confused cause I read something about the summons the other day being in a patch too? Haven't followed the news recently
            indeed there is! it's an item pack add-on that gives you the three summons
Did you play games at 7 fps on an n64? Trust me, your 4k 30 is fine. Dont let anyone say its not a good way to play.
    I <3 Star Fox SNES
4k30 looks like I‚Äôm playing into the spider verse.
Is it just my display? I don‚Äôt remember it being this bad on the pro.
    It has a very aggressive motion blur , so until you get used to it looks weird , in my experience switching back and forth between 60 to 30 does weird stuff to your perception , just keep it a while on 30 and eventually your mind will see it fluid and smooth
        Honestly, to me the FPS difference is bigger than the graphics difference so I‚Äôm keeping performance haha.
            I get it , for me it depends on the game , I was playing FF15 at 60 on my 1080p tv on PC , when I upgraded to my 4K tv I couldn‚Äôt stand neither 1080p blurryness or 4k30 and I ended up paying scalper prices for a 3070 

But for this and for example miles morales , 4k30 felt good , specially since I do love my crispy pixels
                I played miles on 4K 30 and I don‚Äôt remember it looking this bad? But like you said it must be the smoothing.
    Definitely have the same experience in terms of the 30fps mode being *very noticeable* in terms of it's choppiness.  With interpolation on, i finally got the settings to work in a way that smoothed it out fine...but on scenes that have a lot of wires, chain link fences, lines of any kind the interpolation hiccups like crazy.

However, it's only noticeable because when you switch it to 60fps it's gone completely, and the image becomes vastly more stable.

When sitting still, 4k may look a bit sharper, but in motion you lose so much detail at 30fps that it's just better to do 1620p/60
    I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks this
    I also have 77 inch C8, and I kept switching between the graphics mode,  but I honestly couldn‚Äôt see any improvements on Graphics setting. (Which I‚Äôm actually happy about, because I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out on anything when running buttery smooth 60fps performance mode)
Try turning on the Motion Pro option in the Picture settings when on 60 FPS mode. It lowers brightness and has a miniscule chance of introducing some minor artifacting, but it makes everything butter smooth.
100% agreed. 60 fps is too blurry and 4K is so sharp!
That's not what it implies at all. Not in the slightest. They get to Kalm this way for the obvious reason that Part 2 will start with the Nibelheim flashback, like most people already expected. There will absolutely be a big open area as soon as you leave Kalm.
    Will there absolutely be a big open area??? Ffxv was the last game with a giant open world and even  that wasn't huge in comparison to what ff7 offers. So don't be dissapointed if it's not open.
        I personally think it will be large hub areas, which I'm totally fine with. Open world games are usually pretty empty, I'd rather they focus on making things as dense as possible rather than as large as possible. Still with freedom to move around of course
            Nomura directly stated in the First Soldier livestream that in Part 2, Cloud would be running through wide, natural areas. So it would most definitely be open world, though the story might be linear like in OG. Plus I feel like we should have faith in the devs, they seem to know what fans would like to see for FFVIIR and open world is the highest on the wishlist.
Delete the digital version from your system; insert disc, should then give you access on the store
    I didn't even have to dok that, but good for those having potential issues yeah.
OK I beat Wrath Hound solo by keeping pressuring with close combat and physical attack skill. Can't let down for a moment.

Ramuh Stull destroys me.
Wrong thread. This is for Intergrade. Not Intermission.
    Ah, shit. Thanks.
I think I'm going with Performance, since I'm on a 1080p TV, but I'm wondering if the graphics mode has improvements besides resolution.
I'm personally going for graphics, I really only pick frame rate if it's first person or combat intensive like Ghost of Tsushima or a hardcore action rpg.
Yeah they are but not much. I noticed the triggers on the bike section in chapter4. Also there is a little bit of haptic vibrations on Dualsense in combat compared to the old vibrations on the DualShock 4.But it could jsut be the controller just has better vibrations overall anyway. Hard to tell, Pretty basic but appreciated.
Nope
Did you wait til the game was fully downloaded/installed? Or did you start playing as soon as it was "playable?"
    Playable, which is probably why
Not having this issue yet.
Also wanna know this. That shit takes up A LOT of space on the small ass drive.
    [removed]
        Shouldn‚Äôt that be small-ass drive? Stupid bot. what‚Äôs an ass-drive? Lol
            > small ass-drive

    Edit: You need the ps4 play disc in, but you can delete the actual 86gb content! Just took the chance and tried it!
It‚Äôs in English and works. Source, myself playing it right now.
    yeah, it does work! i played about 30 minutes, going to bed now
The weapon ability damages all enemies in chain so it's nice plus it has a pretty good and balanced ability tree
Honestly it should be played after the main campaign. It‚Äôs pegged as an Intermission between VII Remake and the next game. Think of it like MGS3 where it‚Äôs set before MGS1 but it‚Äôs still best to play after MGS2.
    I can‚Äôt wait that long Jack! Haha
        You could always do what I‚Äôm gonna do. Play Intermission, then VII Remake; then Intermission again. XD
            Clever!
Do chapter 1 of Yuffies DLC once you get to chapter 8 of the main game.

Then do chapter 2 of Yuffie after chapter 12. Then make sure to skip the final cutscene after Yuffies credits then complete the main game (the cutscene seemingly plays at the end of both Yuffie and the main games completion).
It takes place throughout Chapters 8-12.
    Thanks!
There‚Äôs a hidden time box just behind you at the start. That‚Äôs a little help.
    Ohh sneaky. Hehehe.
IIRC you have to do all of the colosseum and Shinra combat sims. And there are some that can only be done on hard mode.
    I‚Äôve finished them all on my last play through. Went there and saw no new ones.
        > To unlock the final 5-round battle, you‚Äôll have to complete all Colosseum battles, all Shinra Combat Simulator battles, and all Battle Intel challenges.

> The Top Secret challenge is only available in Hard Mode ‚Äî Hard Mode and the Hojo‚Äôs Lab Battle Simulator both unlock after completing the game.

Got this off a site
            That's how to unlock the final simulator fight in the original game. Intergrade's stats page counts a new one, with a new enemy intel.

I am also wondering how to unlock it. I've been googling for like 40 minutes, and this is the only comment I've seen of anyone even talking about it.
                Gotcha. Well I guess I'm not sure then.
                    I'm guessing you'd need to beat Intermission, and it'll unlock, since that's the only thing left to do if you've got all the others unlocked and beaten
                        I'll have to wait to test the theory. I'm working through Intergrade first.
                        If you're talking about the extra fights in Intermission I got them by starting chapter 2 on hard mode (once you've beat the game the first time.)
                            No, the stats in the main game count an extra fight and enemy intel
So they're really trying to push the alternate timeline
    Yeah. I'm personally ok with it. I like Zack, he's the best thing about Crisis Core, and why Crisis Core is the best out of all the compilation games.
Every Soldier has Jenova cells. They just aren‚Äôt susceptible to her or Sephiroth‚Äôs control. 

So, yeah, for all intents and purposes, it ends up being the same.
I would hope the party doesn't run into Zack cuz it wouldn't make any sense at all. He was also holding the buster sword that cloud obviously has, so it's safe to assume Zack is dead.
I already have my theory which doesn't deviate from the og with all these scenes but instead deppens it. Like Sephirot, Zack will may have overwritten his death because he had this porpuse of helping cloud and apologize to Aerith. Or maybe people injected with jenovah cannot diffuse into lifestream as long as Sephirot will persist
You have to use the ability command then use right and left to select the ninjutsu command fire/ice/aero/lighting ninjutsu
    Oh I have to do it through the command menu? Somehow the tutorial did not quite make this clear. Thank you.
Yeah that's the whole reason I came to this thread. To discuss the ending.
    ...what else would you want to discuss?
        Literally just the ending. It left me confused
[deleted]
    Alternate timeline shit I assume. Can‚Äôt wait for it to make sense once Part 2 is out.
    Potentially geostigma introduction???
There should be two separate trophy lists, one for the PS4 and PS5 version respectively. So it might look like your trophies are gone, but that‚Äôs actually a second list.
    oooh ok phew. but if i replay this game on the ps5, does that mean it'll unlock it on the ps5 trophy list then?
        If you replay the PS5 version of the game on PS5 then it‚Äôll unlock these new PS5 version trophies.

If you‚Äôve already played the PS4 version, what you could do is download the PS4 version again (just the first 10GB or so till you can start it) then from the PS4 version you can upload your game save. Then go to the PS5 version of the game and download those game saves (this is all done from the FF7R main menu) and then all the trophies you earned from the PS4 version will suddenly unlock for the PS5 trophy list! If that makes sense.
            its sorta frustrating the sony didnt make this like a more seamless process lmao. you should've seen my morning trying to figure out how to get the ps5 version and then having to get the DLC
            I loaded the cloud save through FFVII Remake and the trophies didn't pop. What am I doing wrong?
                Did you upload the saves through the Upload save function within the PS4 version of VII Remake? It‚Äôs within the game, not PS+ Cloud saves.
                    Yes, that's what I said.
                        I‚Äôm not sure then. Should be as simple as uploading in VIIR | PS4 and then using the Download Save function in VIIR | PS5. That‚Äôs what I did.
                            I did the same thing and my save is still not showing on ps5. I retried uploading the save too. I also checked my ps5 save storage and it‚Äôs on the system itself as well but not showing up when I boot the game up. Huge bummer.
Not me. Still shows 54 trophies.
I have seen a hdr controls in the menu which I feel my tv needs as the blacks are not that dark, but yeah the hdr looks way better
[deleted]
    Chinese version works fine and is in English. Feel free to download.
I was just googling this cuz I did the same thing, and apparently this exact same thing happened last year when the original game came out and Sony had to offer refunds.
    This one happened to Region 3 stores which does sell the FFVIIR in chinese/korean.

Now it's happening on R1 stores which doesn't even have chinese/korean base game. I don't know what happened.
        Saw a thread on Resetera and one guy said he bit the bullet and got that version and it works fine, but I‚Äôm gonna wait until morning before I download the copy I bought.
    Sweet hell.
Was just wondering the same. I didn't end up buying because it said that.
    I bought it. Works fine with US version of the game
Intermission happens across multiple chapters of Intergrade. So one doesn't really happen before the other.

Try this for the upgrade.
The way I got it for the disc version was to go to the installed game in my library, press Options, View Product, Three Dots button, then there should be an option for the upgrade.
    It doesn't allow me to purchase intergrade.  All of them that lead to intergrade just lead me to the imgur error I posted.
        How about this page?

https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA01903_00-7462776201452750
            Not available for purchase.

I think I have to wait until support opens up.  I think this issue is from the period when they offered ff7 remake for free.  I read that you cannot upgrade from that free content to intergrade.  I don't remember if I added that to the account, and now the account thinks I have that instead of the ff7 remake that I purchased.
                The item on the right is the one you want. It looks like it's already in your library. Just have to download it now. You don't need to purchase the first two.
                    That's the ps4 to ps5 upgrade.  I downloaded 80 gigs to see if it did anything.  Nope.
                        I'm confused then. What exactly are you looking for?

You have Intergrade already in your library already. You can't purchase what you already have.
                            I thought I had to purchase intergrade.  I'm dumb.  I tried to avoid anything about intergrade to avoid spoilers, but I should have at least looked at how it gets released.
                                Yep.

PS4 > PS5 Intergrade = free but no Yuffie DLC. 

Fresh PS5 Intergrade purchase = $70 but includes Yuffie DLC

Standalone Yuffie DLC = $20
Wrong thread. This is for Intergrade. You want Intermission.

https://en.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/nw5ax2/intermission_complete_discussion/?
    how? i didnt finish it yet
        Intergrade is just the FF7 Remake.

Intermission is the Yuffie DLC.

You can always check the Chapter 1 thread.
They will likely be gone in Part 2 but there's so many of them in this game that it would be hard to rework it all.
    You're probably right in that Part 2 won't have them. Still, the fact that there is a specific PS5 version of the game made me think that they were going to make changes to accommodate the PS5 abilities. At this point, it feels like what they improved could have been done with a patch to the PS4 version.
        The intermission dlc doesn't have them, that I could notice, so that's what I'd expect for the next part. The closest thing was fences to prevent you from skipping certain fights.
They're still in the game.
Dude... Wrong thread. This is for Intergrade not Intermission.
It hasn't released yet, you've got a couple more minutes to wait, I believe.
    still nothing here

&#x200B;

edit : we're good
        Me neither, it is telling me I can‚Äôt get it because I already own the PS4 version
            I think you are supposed to search the psn store for ff7 remake upgrade not ff7 intergrade
                Yep, that‚Äôs it. Good catch.
The PS+ version doesn't upgrade for free.
    I have the original digital version
        You should be able to upgrade it by going to the page for it and clicking the three dots; I was able to without a disk.
            Yeah when I go to it it says insert disc. Idk thanks for trying to help tho i accidentally purchased it again for 69.99
That's easy. Intermission is PS5 exclusive.
    [deleted]
        It wont ever be on ps4.
        I highly doubt it's coming to PS4. Series X/S and PC? Sure. but not a last gen console.
You can't play Intermission on PS4, it's PS5 exclusive.

        Final Fantasy PC ports generally suck.
            Its a bit more complex than that.

The older PC ports are pretty bad but 15 is the most recent one and 15 runs and looks better on PC than on the original ps4 version by a landslide. 

There's at least a decent chance ff7r will have a good port imo. That said, you might wait a long time as intergrade has definitely made it likely the pc port is still a long ways off.
                The version of 15 I played on the PC had horrible hitching, even though my FPS was decent. When I read about it, it was a common issue. I can't remember if it was Steam or Windows Store
                    https://youtu.be/MWuRlgFpVIQ

Digital foundry definitely feel it's a substantial improvement
                FF7R and FF15 do not use the same engine. FF15 uses the luminous engine. FF7R uses UE4.
                    You are totally right and I honestly don't know why I forgot this and confused myself. Edited my original comment.
We don‚Äôt know anything about how the next game is going to work. 

The weapon grinding is probably meant for preparing for Hard Mode.
We don't know and this is a thread for Intergrade. Not Intermission.
The way I got it for the disc version was to go to the installed game, press Options, View Product, Three Dots button, then there should be an option for the upgrade. 

At least IIRC that's how it worked.
    ooohhhh yes thank you, I went to the 'old' FF7 Remake in the store and there it had an 'upgrade' button.

Duh, I'm an idiot, thank you :D
Intergrade = PS5 version.

Intergrade purchased will have the Yuffie dlc included.

Intergrade as the free PS4 > PS5 upgrade has no Yuffie dlc.

Yuffie DLC is $20.
    Gotcha thanks
Intergrade is just the name of the pack in the store that contains the VIIR PS5 version and Intermission.
    Gotcha thanks
Weiss is very much an optional superboss type of design. I don‚Äôt think they would put something of that difficultly on the critical path in later games.
>for this in particular you seem to be required to have good twitch reflexes to get him pressured.

Only for phase 1. And the timing isn't too strict either. (I definitely found it easier than trying to perfect guard with Yuffie consistently). It's more a matter of figuring out which direction you're supposed to dodge specific attacks. (ie: stab = dodge forward, Evisceration = dodge back, Crosswise Cleave = dodge left or right). 

Phase 2's a magic phase for your characters. Constant character switching and proper strategy is what's important here. 

For phase 3, I'm not sure there's any legit way to reliably dodge those attacks. It feels more like a survival phase even though he's very vulnerable to physical attacks here. Honestly, the best way I found through phase 3 is to save a level 2 limit for it since using one will instantly boost his stagger gauge from empty to just about full. 

But I will admit, beating him without getting good at phase 1 will definitely make the fight take a lot more time than it needs to.
Yes you can; just delete the digital copy and put the disc in
You can, if you are in the US it isn't live yet
    Why does everyone with the disc copy get a countdown timer while those of us with digital just get a message saying, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt buy this bitch, you already bought the game‚Äù. I have the disc copy, but it‚Äôs unopened and will stay that way for at least another decade.
        Dude just open it and have some fun
            Even then I won‚Äôt be able to play because I can‚Äôt download the new one because I purchased the digital version. I‚Äôm hoping it unlocks at midnight EST, shouldn‚Äôt take more than a few minutes to download on my internet.

I have the physical copy so that I always have a copy of the game, no matter what. It‚Äôs tucked away for safe keeping with my PS1 copy.
                You could just delete the digital version and install the physical, the ps4 recognizes it as two different ones.
                    It finally worked, and thankfully my internet is fast enough I was playing within 5m, fully installed in 20. You playing it? DLC is super cool.
                        I'll have to wait until its either out on ps4 or when I get the ps5 man. I saw a couple minutes and it looks really great. Have you finished it already?
        The way Sony blocks you out of buying bundles and such because you own part of it is weird and confusing
        I don't have a disc, I have a digital ps5 but I actually went to the website story page on my computer and it has a countdown timer there.
This is sucks
Create a new account on your ps5 and get the upgrade
Not really no, it's just smoother.
    R u kidding me? The conversations are over in a blink. Everything is rushed. The combat is smooth everything else is a disaster. You simply have no time to comprehend what the fuck is going on. Im shocked square would release this. A game designed around 30 FPS does not translate well to 60 FPS. PERIOD. Its like everyone is talking in fast motion and the scenes are over in a blink. This PS5 version is not enjoyable whatsoever imo. Its like they took the PS4 version and pressed fast forward X2.
        It‚Äôs literally optimized for 60fps. You just aren‚Äôt used to it. It isn‚Äôt running any faster than it does at 30fps.
            its not running any faster than 30fps? Are you on crack? the whole fucking game is sped up to 60 fps, which means everything is faster. The problem is combat and out of combat dont synce. The dumbtards at square thought that they could give us 60fps without realizing it will fuck up everything non combat. the idiots at square made a 30fps game that dont fit in a 60 fps world. they are dumb idiots. the sooner the feedback gets to them the sooner the lightbulb may possibly go off in their brains.
                That‚Äôs not how FPS works lol. It‚Äôs running at the exact same speed at double the frames. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfaster‚Äù at all. It‚Äôs SMOOTHER. If shit‚Äôs off sync for you, then check your TV settings. That‚Äôs a you-problem.

This isn‚Äôt a KH PS4 situation. At all.
                    r u on crack? i just played it and its SHIT. 60 fps is awesome for combat, its not so awesome for the flow of the game and cutscenes that are double speed and look FUCKING REDICULOUS pardon my language, but the game has been ruined. You cant slap 4k and 60fps on top of a 2k 30fps designed game and think you can get away with it. the pacing in the ps5 version is HORENDOUS.
                        You‚Äôre the one on crack mate. The conversations and out of combat scenes are the exact same length of time. It just plays more frames in that time, hence 60fps.

The only thing it could be is your getting a similar effect as the ‚Äòsoap opera effect‚Äô when tv‚Äôs have motion stuff on. Check if your TV had that stuff on then turn it off
                            yea which means its FASTER. The scenes outside of combat ARE FASTER which means the 60 fps is ruining the original flow of the game. I played the new version, i could barely read the convos before it moved on. ITS TOO FAST. Combat at 60 fps is GREAT. The entire game at 60 fps IS NOT GREAT.
                                No. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs faster. 1 minute at 30 FPS is the exact same as 1 minute at 60fps. It just has more frames. Making it smoother.

If what you were saying is true, the characters would sound like chipmunks and the music would be all out of whack. And all the animations would be comically funny and it would be plastered everywhere on the internet.

However you‚Äôre wrong. Not sure why you just can‚Äôt admit it rather than make yourself sound like a fool.
                                You are really set on saying dumb stuff over and over aren't you?

Repeat after me: The game is not faster at 60 FPS.
        I think you're trolling.
            trolling what? you think im bashing the game on purpose? the fucking game is 2x fast as the ps4 version. there is no flow in the game. did you even play it?
        What are you talking about LOL
	
I stopped using the 60 FPS mode. Most people won't notice or care but, I've noticed some effects like smoke, certain animations and lighting updating at 30 fps, maybe less.

My brain just gets easily distracted by these discrepancies as small as they are. I think most of will be fine or won't even notice. It's tough though because 60 fps combat is butter smooth.

Also some of the pre rendered cut scenes are still in 30 fps too which can be slightly awkward.
Doubt it will ever come out for the PS4.
My guess? It won't come to PS4, but I'd like it to so more people can play it.
they never said the upgrade would be free, they actually made it clear the upgrade to intergrade would be free and it would allow you to then buy the yuffie dlc
They never said the DLC was free. Just the upgrade.
Only you are having an issue with understanding this.
Not a mirror.
Options square
This thread is for Intergrade. Not Intermission.
Update: options + square I'm blind lol
Looked like $20
It‚Äôs not worth it unless you want a digital art book and mini soundtrack. The summons from the PS4 deluxe version are part of a free DLC now.
    Oh ok!
wrong thread. This is for Intergrade.
I don‚Äôt think FFVIIR has Ray tracing, they‚Äôre probably saving that for Part 2
    I guess I assumed it's what they meant by enhanced lighting. Well if it's purely 4K vs 60fps, then I'm sticking with 60fps.
        Good choice
As far as I've seen and experienced, the only difference is resolution. There's no Ray Tracing in either version.
You can delete it.
    Ok thanks!
It took all but 15 seconds to import my uploaded save.
    For some reason it‚Äôs taking me ages! My internet is great otherwise but for some reason I‚Äôm still only on 40%.
Yeah what kind of internet are you on, the save import is almost instantaneous
Wrong thread. This is for Intergrade.
    Fort Condor is the mini game within Intergrade.
        Fort condor is in intermission.
            Wow....I am a moron.
                We all have those days. It doesn't help with Square naming things like INTERgrade and INTERmission.
                    Yeah i guess i just need 238day/12...errr what were we talking about again?
                The marketing was super weird. Most people thought the ps5 upgrade didn't have a name and the dlc was intergrade. But intergrade is actually the upgrade and yuffie is intermission
Check the receipt. They sometimes print codes on that
Game feels and looks completely diff in 60fps. I‚Äôm replaying it and enjoying it more than the first time.
That really depends on you. 

1. On one hand, from what I understand, there's very little new content. On the other hand, why wouldn't you want to experience it in 60fps?

2. Using your old save allows you to transfer your trophies and use your suped up characters to easily go through the game.
    Fair enough, thanks for answering.
Can‚Äôt say new content in main game is massive. However I am amazed by the difference 60fps makes
    Yeah I dropped in on my old save data to take a quick peek and it was honestly breathtaking. Really tempted to play it again lol
No, the only thing you need to complete a chapter for is hard mode credit, or quest progression that affects other things, such as what dresses you get and chapter 14 resolutions.
A couple of mine didn't either. I had like 43 and I'm down to 36 now.
    I platinumed ps4 but lost my save data because i didn't back it up before getting a ps5. 

Earlier in the year, I did a quick run on easy to get back to chapter selection so I can essentially redo my old save file.

I transferred that file, just with easy cleared, and all of my trophies from the old save came over, platinum and all.

The trophy system is weird.
D->V->R->D. Use the newest board you have and just build your team off what counters his troops. I was surprised how easy it all is, grandmaster battle was extremely easy too. Just don't place any troops until the opponent does and then counter. It ends when you leave sector 7, so you'll def know if you're crossing the point of no return.
Yes and the game will warn you when you cannot return again
It happened to me once. Scared the shit out of me.

I unplugged my ps5 and let it sit for a few minutes and plugged it back in.

Hasn't happened since. But I'm still scared it will.
    Yeah after the second I played a few other games for a long time without issue.

So shut the PS5 down over night and going to clean it today to see if that helps.

If it crashed again, am going to reinstall.
No crashes here
Use the combat simulator imo
I just finished intermission and have no idea what you're talking about lmao
    Same lol
    Sorry I‚Äôm talking about >!Zack at the church where he though aerith was!<
        Zacks dead. Why are you saying there's a second cloud running around?
            In Zack‚Äôs timeline, there should be another Cloud as well since they were both seen alive together at the end of the original ending.
                Zack died in the outskirts of midgar. It doesn't make sense that he'd be holding the buster sword that cloud clearly has. I don't think we're seeing an alternate timeline, I think he's just dead and doesn't realize it.
                    Some people think he's in the lifestream, which is plausible. Another theory is that Zack surviving his battle has altered the timeline, which since the party was in the Whispers dimension when they defeated them, were unaffected by the change. So Cloud would still have the buster sword handed to him by Zack while the Zack who never died would have his. Or he's in another timeline completely, it's one of those 3 probably.
                        Why do we even have this alternate timeline/dimension thing going around? I feel like it has no bearing.
                            Because of the nature of the previous game, having the Whispers a totally non existent thing in the OG game be pretty prominent. When you bring up things like destiny and fate and changing that, people will have ideas pertaining where to go with it. No one knows where this remake is going, it'll probably follow the OG's story to a point, but Zack himself is probably the main factor on how much it does, maybe he's a ghost maybe he's not, it's all up in the air.
                                Interesting. That's weird lol. The game is definitely not in some alternate timeline I think people are just running with the idea but only time will tell.
                                I‚Äôm not sure how credible this is but this is from an Inverse article:

‚ÄúWe wanted to have the last boss fight take place at the highway in Midgar, which arises questions that I cannot answer," Game Director Tetsuya Nomura said in an interview featured in Final Fantasy VII Remake Ultimania. "There is a character who‚Äôs alive, which leads to a great mystery." This particular quote makes it seem like that battle had to happen on the outskirts of Midgar for some reason, and that reason is linked to "a character who's alive." Other tidbits from Ultimania claim he went missing five years ago, and he's referred to in both the past and present tense, further implying that he's MIA instead of KIA.‚Äù
                            Yeah man beats me, FFVII Remake should have been completed for the PS4, but they are milking this game, if an alternate timeline do exist the story of FFVII becomes convoluted.
                                Ive played through the game multiple times and I just don't at all see why we're even talking about it. It's not a thing. I'm glad they're milking it. They could put it in 20, 20 hour installations and I'd gobble them all up. Ff7 freak lol

Happy cakeday, sailor.
You have to upload it from the PS4 version. There's an "Upload Save Data" option in the main menu of the PS4 version, and a "Download Save Data" option in the main menu of the PS5 version
    Thats my problem the data is the ps4 version of the game but its on my ps5. There is no upload data option on the ps5 version for me to do that with... I was hoping that after the full game downloaded that the ps5 would recognize it but it did not work that way. I already have all of my ps4 data loaded but still missing my ps5 data from the ps4 version. so confusing I know...
        Both versions are installed on your ps5, unless you deleted the PS4 version. You have to literally start the PS4 version and upload from the main menu. The PS5 version will not automatically convert it over.
            Thank you I will see if I can do that when I get home. Didn‚Äôt think it would be two separate games. I thought it would just update over the previous game.
                Nah. The PS5 conversions are weird like that. If you press Options on the game you can select PS4 or PS5, when you have both installed. By default the PS5 version installs alongside the PS4 version
                    You're awesome! Thanks so much!
No use of adaptive triggers or dualsense.

No loading corridors at all though, during the entirety of Intermission, but that alone can't justify PS5 exclusivity.
    I think I felt a little something during the bike parts though. If you brake there‚Äôs a little push and then accelerating again doesn‚Äôt just give out. Then again I could be imagining it. Agreed though, still doesn‚Äôt fully  utilize the ps5 features.
The final boss fight truly feels next gen to me. But without the technical knowledge, it‚Äôs really hard to tell if it can run on a PS4.
Iup still white from a stream I saw
I think it‚Äôs probably partially true. They may not have fought as hard if it was sector 1 for example. The fact it was their home and the people they knew probably played a role in them fighting. Plus you can‚Äôt discount their development. The Avalanche at the beginning of the game and the Avalanche at the end are very different thanks to character development.
    Yes, in the OG game, Barret and Jessie do comment that they are monsters who killed innocent people, althought, for a good cause.
I haven‚Äôt had one yet. You on PS5?
    Yes - I can't even load from my transferred PS4 save file. The game just freezes the on the PS5. It's frustrating as hell. I've reinstalled the PS5 operating system and both games multiple times and same result. 

I can play the PS4 version no problem on the PS5
        That‚Äôs weird. That said, I haven‚Äôt tried a save file I just started a whole new game to experience the 60fps from the beginning in all its glory.
            I'm jealous! It's frustrating knowing I have everything I need but it's just not working.
                That sucks, I've finished the DLC chapters and a couple of the main story chapters and haven't had a single bug, crash or even a frame drop from what I can tell.
                    I'm jealous! I've even gone as far as replacing the PS5 disk for a new one at the store same issue. I think my 2 week old PS5 is a dud.
It‚Äôs unreal. The aftermath portion of the first reactor blowing up where you are working your way back to seventh heaven, my jaw was on the floor with how good it looked.
Base game, post credits.
    If its the one with the party then its on both it seems, because its definitely the ending to Intermission as well.
    thanks, gotta replay it then
Nope, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúsecret ending‚Äù for Yuffie‚Äôs DLC ending.
https://youtu.be/F0sPSgHcURU
    Oh I got that ending in Intermission tho. I think you get the ending in both Intergrade and Intermission
        I finished a base game before, but didn‚Äôt see it.
    wtf. I was completely expecting a rickroll.
I liked it too, but I can see how they might want it to be closer to the original Japanese, where she just makes a surprised sound rather than anything like a ‚Äúcurse word.‚Äù Cursing is culturally very different in Japanese anyway, so who knows.
Yeah I hear you, the only thing I can think of is maybe they thought ‚Äúmature‚Äù sounded too sexy or something? I dunno. I thought it was ok.
    In Intermission there is a dialogue about Wall Market being "mature" and "adult" to explain it to an underage so maybe they wanted not to mix these words with Tifa picking an outfit?
Maybe it's just the VO but Sonon sounded incredibly quite in the game, even after I turned music down. Yuffie sounds just fine but in gameplay without subs I wouldn't know what he was saying.
I just clocked in 10 hours with all side quests done :) it's amazing btw
    Yeah 9 hours for me to do the same. I'll do a hard playthrough as well to get the trophies and because yes it is fucking amazing haha. 

Even if you just do a 9-10 normal playthrough, it is incredible value for $20. Not just in terms of time, but also the content and the characters. Yuffie is so much fun to play, and I hope Part 2 keeps the synergy attacks with party members. A bit like the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games, each combination of party members could have a unique synergy attack.
Thabk you for the confirmation!! Im still downloading the main game!
I purchased so quickly without checking. Fml. Hoping its a title error and its in fact english.
    Also, launching from the in-game tab brings you to the same product page so I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs an error
    Same. I'm hoping it was an error too. A little worried, but it makes no sense if that's the only version available if you're not on a Chinese/Korean PSN. 

I'm in the US.
    Also seeing the same thing. Hoping someone can confirm what's going on there :/
    Yeah, let me know if it‚Äôs correct once you jump in!
        It‚Äôs fine and in English playing now
Thanks!
[deleted]
    Awesome, thank you!
[deleted]
    Yeah even though Im gonna play tonight and don't work the rest of the week I couldn't help myself from surfing around and finding all the little things to spoil myself,   as funny as it is to say I saw the trash and the trash looked good!
Same here. 60fps is nice, but I find the 30fps smooth enough and has a more cinematic feel to it. The native 4k though is breathtaking, such a sharp image.
Go to PSN store > FF7 product page > click the 3 dots > select upgrade option
    yeh thx, but i did that. for some reason it didn't show up for me at all until around 3 am
Yeah I upgraded from PS4 version, I don‚Äôt know how it works with different accounts.  Have you tried logging into using your Irish account and downloading it?
    Yeah I'm logged into my irish account right now. Did you have the digital version *also* from the PSN monthly game? Because I have both (PS4 disc and PS4 digital monthly game) and it says "you are not eligible for the free upgrade to PS5 if you have obtained the game via PSN monthly"... :/ My Japanese account doesn't have PSN so that wasn't a problem but I'm worried it won't let me upgrade the Irish account *because* I have it on PSN.
        Nope, I only have physical.  I‚Äôd suggest you delete the PS+ one and try downloading it again
            I've deleted all the PS4 versions of the game from my console (I only have the PS5 version I downloaded last night, and when I launch it it says "you need to buy this game first"). Is there a way to permanently delete a game from my PSN digital library as well?
                Go to the game itself and click the 3 dots, make sure you select the right version and then see what happens
Product page has a countdown for midnight EST. Is it wrong? I'm seeing 9pm PST

Edit - https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA01903_00-5827003902180177
    It must be local by country then. People in AUS, JAP, etc. are already playing
    That's the same time
        Yeah I'm saying it's not midnight local
            I'm guessing local by country? So US defaults to EST, but European countries, Asian countries, etc. Use their local time (or at least one of their timezones).

Pulling that out of my add though.
                Think you're right because people are posting from other countries that it's out
    Yeah, it'll be 9pm PST or midnight EST. I'm in Texas so it should unlock around 11 PM for me.
        That's what I was thinking. Saying midnight local is only true if you're in EST.
free upgrade to the ps5 intergrade version. it does _not_ include the yuffie dlc though
    So the Yuffie DLC... I haven't seen that on the store at all and was wondering if that's coning up tonight. Do you know anything about that perhaps?
        yea it should be coming up, but it'll cost $20 by itself
            Just had a look on the store during my break and saw that it had finally come up and that Intergrade is now playable so I'll download the whole thing and check it out later!
    I know that, Im just confused cause I read something about the summons the other day being in a patch too? Haven't followed the news recently
        indeed there is! it's an item pack add-on that gives you the three summons
I <3 Star Fox SNES
It has a very aggressive motion blur , so until you get used to it looks weird , in my experience switching back and forth between 60 to 30 does weird stuff to your perception , just keep it a while on 30 and eventually your mind will see it fluid and smooth
    Honestly, to me the FPS difference is bigger than the graphics difference so I‚Äôm keeping performance haha.
        I get it , for me it depends on the game , I was playing FF15 at 60 on my 1080p tv on PC , when I upgraded to my 4K tv I couldn‚Äôt stand neither 1080p blurryness or 4k30 and I ended up paying scalper prices for a 3070 

But for this and for example miles morales , 4k30 felt good , specially since I do love my crispy pixels
            I played miles on 4K 30 and I don‚Äôt remember it looking this bad? But like you said it must be the smoothing.
Definitely have the same experience in terms of the 30fps mode being *very noticeable* in terms of it's choppiness.  With interpolation on, i finally got the settings to work in a way that smoothed it out fine...but on scenes that have a lot of wires, chain link fences, lines of any kind the interpolation hiccups like crazy.

However, it's only noticeable because when you switch it to 60fps it's gone completely, and the image becomes vastly more stable.

When sitting still, 4k may look a bit sharper, but in motion you lose so much detail at 30fps that it's just better to do 1620p/60
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks this
I also have 77 inch C8, and I kept switching between the graphics mode,  but I honestly couldn‚Äôt see any improvements on Graphics setting. (Which I‚Äôm actually happy about, because I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out on anything when running buttery smooth 60fps performance mode)
Will there absolutely be a big open area??? Ffxv was the last game with a giant open world and even  that wasn't huge in comparison to what ff7 offers. So don't be dissapointed if it's not open.
    I personally think it will be large hub areas, which I'm totally fine with. Open world games are usually pretty empty, I'd rather they focus on making things as dense as possible rather than as large as possible. Still with freedom to move around of course
        Nomura directly stated in the First Soldier livestream that in Part 2, Cloud would be running through wide, natural areas. So it would most definitely be open world, though the story might be linear like in OG. Plus I feel like we should have faith in the devs, they seem to know what fans would like to see for FFVIIR and open world is the highest on the wishlist.
I didn't even have to dok that, but good for those having potential issues yeah.
Ah, shit. Thanks.
Playable, which is probably why

    Shouldn‚Äôt that be small-ass drive? Stupid bot. what‚Äôs an ass-drive? Lol

yeah, it does work! i played about 30 minutes, going to bed now
I can‚Äôt wait that long Jack! Haha
    You could always do what I‚Äôm gonna do. Play Intermission, then VII Remake; then Intermission again. XD
        Clever!
Thanks!
Ohh sneaky. Hehehe.
I‚Äôve finished them all on my last play through. Went there and saw no new ones.
    > To unlock the final 5-round battle, you‚Äôll have to complete all Colosseum battles, all Shinra Combat Simulator battles, and all Battle Intel challenges.

> The Top Secret challenge is only available in Hard Mode ‚Äî Hard Mode and the Hojo‚Äôs Lab Battle Simulator both unlock after completing the game.

Got this off a site
        That's how to unlock the final simulator fight in the original game. Intergrade's stats page counts a new one, with a new enemy intel.

I am also wondering how to unlock it. I've been googling for like 40 minutes, and this is the only comment I've seen of anyone even talking about it.
            Gotcha. Well I guess I'm not sure then.
                I'm guessing you'd need to beat Intermission, and it'll unlock, since that's the only thing left to do if you've got all the others unlocked and beaten
                    I'll have to wait to test the theory. I'm working through Intergrade first.
                    If you're talking about the extra fights in Intermission I got them by starting chapter 2 on hard mode (once you've beat the game the first time.)
                        No, the stats in the main game count an extra fight and enemy intel
Yeah. I'm personally ok with it. I like Zack, he's the best thing about Crisis Core, and why Crisis Core is the best out of all the compilation games.
Oh I have to do it through the command menu? Somehow the tutorial did not quite make this clear. Thank you.
...what else would you want to discuss?
    Literally just the ending. It left me confused
Alternate timeline shit I assume. Can‚Äôt wait for it to make sense once Part 2 is out.
Potentially geostigma introduction???
oooh ok phew. but if i replay this game on the ps5, does that mean it'll unlock it on the ps5 trophy list then?
    If you replay the PS5 version of the game on PS5 then it‚Äôll unlock these new PS5 version trophies.

If you‚Äôve already played the PS4 version, what you could do is download the PS4 version again (just the first 10GB or so till you can start it) then from the PS4 version you can upload your game save. Then go to the PS5 version of the game and download those game saves (this is all done from the FF7R main menu) and then all the trophies you earned from the PS4 version will suddenly unlock for the PS5 trophy list! If that makes sense.
        its sorta frustrating the sony didnt make this like a more seamless process lmao. you should've seen my morning trying to figure out how to get the ps5 version and then having to get the DLC
        I loaded the cloud save through FFVII Remake and the trophies didn't pop. What am I doing wrong?
            Did you upload the saves through the Upload save function within the PS4 version of VII Remake? It‚Äôs within the game, not PS+ Cloud saves.
                Yes, that's what I said.
                    I‚Äôm not sure then. Should be as simple as uploading in VIIR | PS4 and then using the Download Save function in VIIR | PS5. That‚Äôs what I did.
                        I did the same thing and my save is still not showing on ps5. I retried uploading the save too. I also checked my ps5 save storage and it‚Äôs on the system itself as well but not showing up when I boot the game up. Huge bummer.
Chinese version works fine and is in English. Feel free to download.
This one happened to Region 3 stores which does sell the FFVIIR in chinese/korean.

Now it's happening on R1 stores which doesn't even have chinese/korean base game. I don't know what happened.
    Saw a thread on Resetera and one guy said he bit the bullet and got that version and it works fine, but I‚Äôm gonna wait until morning before I download the copy I bought.
Sweet hell.
I bought it. Works fine with US version of the game
It doesn't allow me to purchase intergrade.  All of them that lead to intergrade just lead me to the imgur error I posted.
    How about this page?

https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA01903_00-7462776201452750
        Not available for purchase.
https://imgur.com/tYRa0Vh

I think I have to wait until support opens up.  I think this issue is from the period when they offered ff7 remake for free.  I read that you cannot upgrade from that free content to intergrade.  I don't remember if I added that to the account, and now the account thinks I have that instead of the ff7 remake that I purchased.
            The item on the right is the one you want. It looks like it's already in your library. Just have to download it now. You don't need to purchase the first two.
                That's the ps4 to ps5 upgrade.  I downloaded 80 gigs to see if it did anything.  Nope.
                    I'm confused then. What exactly are you looking for?

You have Intergrade already in your library already. You can't purchase what you already have.
                        I thought I had to purchase intergrade.  I'm dumb.  I tried to avoid anything about intergrade to avoid spoilers, but I should have at least looked at how it gets released.
                            Yep.

PS4 > PS5 Intergrade = free but no Yuffie DLC. 

Fresh PS5 Intergrade purchase = $70 but includes Yuffie DLC

Standalone Yuffie DLC = $20
how? i didnt finish it yet
    Intergrade is just the FF7 Remake.

Intermission is the Yuffie DLC.

You can always check the Chapter 1 thread.
You're probably right in that Part 2 won't have them. Still, the fact that there is a specific PS5 version of the game made me think that they were going to make changes to accommodate the PS5 abilities. At this point, it feels like what they improved could have been done with a patch to the PS4 version.
    The intermission dlc doesn't have them, that I could notice, so that's what I'd expect for the next part. The closest thing was fences to prevent you from skipping certain fights.
still nothing here

&#x200B;

edit : we're good
    Me neither, it is telling me I can‚Äôt get it because I already own the PS4 version
        I think you are supposed to search the psn store for ff7 remake upgrade not ff7 intergrade
            Yep, that‚Äôs it. Good catch.
I have the original digital version
    You should be able to upgrade it by going to the page for it and clicking the three dots; I was able to without a disk.
        Yeah when I go to it it says insert disc. Idk thanks for trying to help tho i accidentally purchased it again for 69.99
[deleted]
    It wont ever be on ps4.
    I highly doubt it's coming to PS4. Series X/S and PC? Sure. but not a last gen console.
[deleted]
    Final Fantasy PC ports generally suck.
        Its a bit more complex than that.

The older PC ports are pretty bad but 15 is the most recent one and 15 runs and looks better on PC than on the original ps4 version by a landslide. 

There's at least a decent chance ff7r will have a good port imo. That said, you might wait a long time as intergrade has definitely made it likely the pc port is still a long ways off.
            The version of 15 I played on the PC had horrible hitching, even though my FPS was decent. When I read about it, it was a common issue. I can't remember if it was Steam or Windows Store
                https://youtu.be/MWuRlgFpVIQ

Digital foundry definitely feel it's a substantial improvement
            FF7R and FF15 do not use the same engine. FF15 uses the luminous engine. FF7R uses UE4.
                You are totally right and I honestly don't know why I forgot this and confused myself. Edited my original comment.
ooohhhh yes thank you, I went to the 'old' FF7 Remake in the store and there it had an 'upgrade' button.

Duh, I'm an idiot, thank you :D
Gotcha thanks
Gotcha thanks
Why does everyone with the disc copy get a countdown timer while those of us with digital just get a message saying, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt buy this bitch, you already bought the game‚Äù. I have the disc copy, but it‚Äôs unopened and will stay that way for at least another decade.
    Dude just open it and have some fun
        Even then I won‚Äôt be able to play because I can‚Äôt download the new one because I purchased the digital version. I‚Äôm hoping it unlocks at midnight EST, shouldn‚Äôt take more than a few minutes to download on my internet.

I have the physical copy so that I always have a copy of the game, no matter what. It‚Äôs tucked away for safe keeping with my PS1 copy.
            You could just delete the digital version and install the physical, the ps4 recognizes it as two different ones.
                It finally worked, and thankfully my internet is fast enough I was playing within 5m, fully installed in 20. You playing it? DLC is super cool.
                    I'll have to wait until its either out on ps4 or when I get the ps5 man. I saw a couple minutes and it looks really great. Have you finished it already?
    The way Sony blocks you out of buying bundles and such because you own part of it is weird and confusing
    I don't have a disc, I have a digital ps5 but I actually went to the website story page on my computer and it has a countdown timer there.
R u kidding me? The conversations are over in a blink. Everything is rushed. The combat is smooth everything else is a disaster. You simply have no time to comprehend what the fuck is going on. Im shocked square would release this. A game designed around 30 FPS does not translate well to 60 FPS. PERIOD. Its like everyone is talking in fast motion and the scenes are over in a blink. This PS5 version is not enjoyable whatsoever imo. Its like they took the PS4 version and pressed fast forward X2.
    It‚Äôs literally optimized for 60fps. You just aren‚Äôt used to it. It isn‚Äôt running any faster than it does at 30fps.
        its not running any faster than 30fps? Are you on crack? the whole fucking game is sped up to 60 fps, which means everything is faster. The problem is combat and out of combat dont synce. The dumbtards at square thought that they could give us 60fps without realizing it will fuck up everything non combat. the idiots at square made a 30fps game that dont fit in a 60 fps world. they are dumb idiots. the sooner the feedback gets to them the sooner the lightbulb may possibly go off in their brains.
            That‚Äôs not how FPS works lol. It‚Äôs running at the exact same speed at double the frames. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfaster‚Äù at all. It‚Äôs SMOOTHER. If shit‚Äôs off sync for you, then check your TV settings. That‚Äôs a you-problem.

This isn‚Äôt a KH PS4 situation. At all.
                r u on crack? i just played it and its SHIT. 60 fps is awesome for combat, its not so awesome for the flow of the game and cutscenes that are double speed and look FUCKING REDICULOUS pardon my language, but the game has been ruined. You cant slap 4k and 60fps on top of a 2k 30fps designed game and think you can get away with it. the pacing in the ps5 version is HORENDOUS.
                    You‚Äôre the one on crack mate. The conversations and out of combat scenes are the exact same length of time. It just plays more frames in that time, hence 60fps.

The only thing it could be is your getting a similar effect as the ‚Äòsoap opera effect‚Äô when tv‚Äôs have motion stuff on. Check if your TV had that stuff on then turn it off
                        yea which means its FASTER. The scenes outside of combat ARE FASTER which means the 60 fps is ruining the original flow of the game. I played the new version, i could barely read the convos before it moved on. ITS TOO FAST. Combat at 60 fps is GREAT. The entire game at 60 fps IS NOT GREAT.
                            No. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs faster. 1 minute at 30 FPS is the exact same as 1 minute at 60fps. It just has more frames. Making it smoother.

If what you were saying is true, the characters would sound like chipmunks and the music would be all out of whack. And all the animations would be comically funny and it would be plastered everywhere on the internet.

However you‚Äôre wrong. Not sure why you just can‚Äôt admit it rather than make yourself sound like a fool.
                            You are really set on saying dumb stuff over and over aren't you?

Repeat after me: The game is not faster at 60 FPS.
    I think you're trolling.
        trolling what? you think im bashing the game on purpose? the fucking game is 2x fast as the ps4 version. there is no flow in the game. did you even play it?
    What are you talking about LOL
Oh ok!
I guess I assumed it's what they meant by enhanced lighting. Well if it's purely 4K vs 60fps, then I'm sticking with 60fps.
    Good choice
Ok thanks!
For some reason it‚Äôs taking me ages! My internet is great otherwise but for some reason I‚Äôm still only on 40%.
Fort Condor is the mini game within Intergrade.
    Fort condor is in intermission.
        Wow....I am a moron.
            We all have those days. It doesn't help with Square naming things like INTERgrade and INTERmission.
                Yeah i guess i just need 238day/12...errr what were we talking about again?
            The marketing was super weird. Most people thought the ps5 upgrade didn't have a name and the dlc was intergrade. But intergrade is actually the upgrade and yuffie is intermission
Fair enough, thanks for answering.
Yeah I dropped in on my old save data to take a quick peek and it was honestly breathtaking. Really tempted to play it again lol
I platinumed ps4 but lost my save data because i didn't back it up before getting a ps5. 

Earlier in the year, I did a quick run on easy to get back to chapter selection so I can essentially redo my old save file.

I transferred that file, just with easy cleared, and all of my trophies from the old save came over, platinum and all.

The trophy system is weird.
Yeah after the second I played a few other games for a long time without issue.

So shut the PS5 down over night and going to clean it today to see if that helps.

If it crashed again, am going to reinstall.
Same lol
Sorry I‚Äôm talking about >!Zack at the church where he though aerith was!<
    Zacks dead. Why are you saying there's a second cloud running around?
        In Zack‚Äôs timeline, there should be another Cloud as well since they were both seen alive together at the end of the original ending.
            Zack died in the outskirts of midgar. It doesn't make sense that he'd be holding the buster sword that cloud clearly has. I don't think we're seeing an alternate timeline, I think he's just dead and doesn't realize it.
                Some people think he's in the lifestream, which is plausible. Another theory is that Zack surviving his battle has altered the timeline, which since the party was in the Whispers dimension when they defeated them, were unaffected by the change. So Cloud would still have the buster sword handed to him by Zack while the Zack who never died would have his. Or he's in another timeline completely, it's one of those 3 probably.
                    Why do we even have this alternate timeline/dimension thing going around? I feel like it has no bearing.
                        Because of the nature of the previous game, having the Whispers a totally non existent thing in the OG game be pretty prominent. When you bring up things like destiny and fate and changing that, people will have ideas pertaining where to go with it. No one knows where this remake is going, it'll probably follow the OG's story to a point, but Zack himself is probably the main factor on how much it does, maybe he's a ghost maybe he's not, it's all up in the air.
                            Interesting. That's weird lol. The game is definitely not in some alternate timeline I think people are just running with the idea but only time will tell.
                            I‚Äôm not sure how credible this is but this is from an Inverse article:

‚ÄúWe wanted to have the last boss fight take place at the highway in Midgar, which arises questions that I cannot answer," Game Director Tetsuya Nomura said in an interview featured in Final Fantasy VII Remake Ultimania. "There is a character who‚Äôs alive, which leads to a great mystery." This particular quote makes it seem like that battle had to happen on the outskirts of Midgar for some reason, and that reason is linked to "a character who's alive." Other tidbits from Ultimania claim he went missing five years ago, and he's referred to in both the past and present tense, further implying that he's MIA instead of KIA.‚Äù
                        Yeah man beats me, FFVII Remake should have been completed for the PS4, but they are milking this game, if an alternate timeline do exist the story of FFVII becomes convoluted.
                            Ive played through the game multiple times and I just don't at all see why we're even talking about it. It's not a thing. I'm glad they're milking it. They could put it in 20, 20 hour installations and I'd gobble them all up. Ff7 freak lol

Happy cakeday, sailor.
Thats my problem the data is the ps4 version of the game but its on my ps5. There is no upload data option on the ps5 version for me to do that with... I was hoping that after the full game downloaded that the ps5 would recognize it but it did not work that way. I already have all of my ps4 data loaded but still missing my ps5 data from the ps4 version. so confusing I know...
    Both versions are installed on your ps5, unless you deleted the PS4 version. You have to literally start the PS4 version and upload from the main menu. The PS5 version will not automatically convert it over.
        Thank you I will see if I can do that when I get home. Didn‚Äôt think it would be two separate games. I thought it would just update over the previous game.
            Nah. The PS5 conversions are weird like that. If you press Options on the game you can select PS4 or PS5, when you have both installed. By default the PS5 version installs alongside the PS4 version
                You're awesome! Thanks so much!
I think I felt a little something during the bike parts though. If you brake there‚Äôs a little push and then accelerating again doesn‚Äôt just give out. Then again I could be imagining it. Agreed though, still doesn‚Äôt fully  utilize the ps5 features.
Yes, in the OG game, Barret and Jessie do comment that they are monsters who killed innocent people, althought, for a good cause.
Yes - I can't even load from my transferred PS4 save file. The game just freezes the on the PS5. It's frustrating as hell. I've reinstalled the PS5 operating system and both games multiple times and same result. 

I can play the PS4 version no problem on the PS5
    That‚Äôs weird. That said, I haven‚Äôt tried a save file I just started a whole new game to experience the 60fps from the beginning in all its glory.
        I'm jealous! It's frustrating knowing I have everything I need but it's just not working.
            That sucks, I've finished the DLC chapters and a couple of the main story chapters and haven't had a single bug, crash or even a frame drop from what I can tell.
                I'm jealous! I've even gone as far as replacing the PS5 disk for a new one at the store same issue. I think my 2 week old PS5 is a dud.
If its the one with the party then its on both it seems, because its definitely the ending to Intermission as well.
thanks, gotta replay it then
Oh I got that ending in Intermission tho. I think you get the ending in both Intergrade and Intermission
    I finished a base game before, but didn‚Äôt see it.
wtf. I was completely expecting a rickroll.
In Intermission there is a dialogue about Wall Market being "mature" and "adult" to explain it to an underage so maybe they wanted not to mix these words with Tifa picking an outfit?
Yeah 9 hours for me to do the same. I'll do a hard playthrough as well to get the trophies and because yes it is fucking amazing haha. 

Even if you just do a 9-10 normal playthrough, it is incredible value for $20. Not just in terms of time, but also the content and the characters. Yuffie is so much fun to play, and I hope Part 2 keeps the synergy attacks with party members. A bit like the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games, each combination of party members could have a unique synergy attack.
Also, launching from the in-game tab brings you to the same product page so I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs an error
Same. I'm hoping it was an error too. A little worried, but it makes no sense if that's the only version available if you're not on a Chinese/Korean PSN. 

I'm in the US.
Also seeing the same thing. Hoping someone can confirm what's going on there :/
Yeah, let me know if it‚Äôs correct once you jump in!
    It‚Äôs fine and in English playing now
Awesome, thank you!
Yeah even though Im gonna play tonight and don't work the rest of the week I couldn't help myself from surfing around and finding all the little things to spoil myself,   as funny as it is to say I saw the trash and the trash looked good!
yeh thx, but i did that. for some reason it didn't show up for me at all until around 3 am
Yeah I'm logged into my irish account right now. Did you have the digital version *also* from the PSN monthly game? Because I have both (PS4 disc and PS4 digital monthly game) and it says "you are not eligible for the free upgrade to PS5 if you have obtained the game via PSN monthly"... :/ My Japanese account doesn't have PSN so that wasn't a problem but I'm worried it won't let me upgrade the Irish account *because* I have it on PSN.
    Nope, I only have physical.  I‚Äôd suggest you delete the PS+ one and try downloading it again
        I've deleted all the PS4 versions of the game from my console (I only have the PS5 version I downloaded last night, and when I launch it it says "you need to buy this game first"). Is there a way to permanently delete a game from my PSN digital library as well?
            Go to the game itself and click the 3 dots, make sure you select the right version and then see what happens
It must be local by country then. People in AUS, JAP, etc. are already playing
That's the same time
    Yeah I'm saying it's not midnight local
        I'm guessing local by country? So US defaults to EST, but European countries, Asian countries, etc. Use their local time (or at least one of their timezones).

Pulling that out of my add though.
            Think you're right because people are posting from other countries that it's out
Yeah, it'll be 9pm PST or midnight EST. I'm in Texas so it should unlock around 11 PM for me.
    That's what I was thinking. Saying midnight local is only true if you're in EST.
So the Yuffie DLC... I haven't seen that on the store at all and was wondering if that's coning up tonight. Do you know anything about that perhaps?
    yea it should be coming up, but it'll cost $20 by itself
        Just had a look on the store during my break and saw that it had finally come up and that Intergrade is now playable so I'll download the whole thing and check it out later!
I know that, Im just confused cause I read something about the summons the other day being in a patch too? Haven't followed the news recently
    indeed there is! it's an item pack add-on that gives you the three summons
Honestly, to me the FPS difference is bigger than the graphics difference so I‚Äôm keeping performance haha.
    I get it , for me it depends on the game , I was playing FF15 at 60 on my 1080p tv on PC , when I upgraded to my 4K tv I couldn‚Äôt stand neither 1080p blurryness or 4k30 and I ended up paying scalper prices for a 3070 

But for this and for example miles morales , 4k30 felt good , specially since I do love my crispy pixels
        I played miles on 4K 30 and I don‚Äôt remember it looking this bad? But like you said it must be the smoothing.
I personally think it will be large hub areas, which I'm totally fine with. Open world games are usually pretty empty, I'd rather they focus on making things as dense as possible rather than as large as possible. Still with freedom to move around of course
    Nomura directly stated in the First Soldier livestream that in Part 2, Cloud would be running through wide, natural areas. So it would most definitely be open world, though the story might be linear like in OG. Plus I feel like we should have faith in the devs, they seem to know what fans would like to see for FFVIIR and open world is the highest on the wishlist.
Shouldn‚Äôt that be small-ass drive? Stupid bot. what‚Äôs an ass-drive? Lol
    > small ass-drive

You could always do what I‚Äôm gonna do. Play Intermission, then VII Remake; then Intermission again. XD
    Clever!
> To unlock the final 5-round battle, you‚Äôll have to complete all Colosseum battles, all Shinra Combat Simulator battles, and all Battle Intel challenges.

> The Top Secret challenge is only available in Hard Mode ‚Äî Hard Mode and the Hojo‚Äôs Lab Battle Simulator both unlock after completing the game.

Got this off a site
    That's how to unlock the final simulator fight in the original game. Intergrade's stats page counts a new one, with a new enemy intel.

I am also wondering how to unlock it. I've been googling for like 40 minutes, and this is the only comment I've seen of anyone even talking about it.
        Gotcha. Well I guess I'm not sure then.
            I'm guessing you'd need to beat Intermission, and it'll unlock, since that's the only thing left to do if you've got all the others unlocked and beaten
                I'll have to wait to test the theory. I'm working through Intergrade first.
                If you're talking about the extra fights in Intermission I got them by starting chapter 2 on hard mode (once you've beat the game the first time.)
                    No, the stats in the main game count an extra fight and enemy intel
Literally just the ending. It left me confused
If you replay the PS5 version of the game on PS5 then it‚Äôll unlock these new PS5 version trophies.

If you‚Äôve already played the PS4 version, what you could do is download the PS4 version again (just the first 10GB or so till you can start it) then from the PS4 version you can upload your game save. Then go to the PS5 version of the game and download those game saves (this is all done from the FF7R main menu) and then all the trophies you earned from the PS4 version will suddenly unlock for the PS5 trophy list! If that makes sense.
    its sorta frustrating the sony didnt make this like a more seamless process lmao. you should've seen my morning trying to figure out how to get the ps5 version and then having to get the DLC
    I loaded the cloud save through FFVII Remake and the trophies didn't pop. What am I doing wrong?
        Did you upload the saves through the Upload save function within the PS4 version of VII Remake? It‚Äôs within the game, not PS+ Cloud saves.
            Yes, that's what I said.
                I‚Äôm not sure then. Should be as simple as uploading in VIIR | PS4 and then using the Download Save function in VIIR | PS5. That‚Äôs what I did.
                    I did the same thing and my save is still not showing on ps5. I retried uploading the save too. I also checked my ps5 save storage and it‚Äôs on the system itself as well but not showing up when I boot the game up. Huge bummer.
Saw a thread on Resetera and one guy said he bit the bullet and got that version and it works fine, but I‚Äôm gonna wait until morning before I download the copy I bought.
How about this page?

I think I have to wait until support opens up.  I think this issue is from the period when they offered ff7 remake for free.  I read that you cannot upgrade from that free content to intergrade.  I don't remember if I added that to the account, and now the account thinks I have that instead of the ff7 remake that I purchased.
        The item on the right is the one you want. It looks like it's already in your library. Just have to download it now. You don't need to purchase the first two.
            That's the ps4 to ps5 upgrade.  I downloaded 80 gigs to see if it did anything.  Nope.
                I'm confused then. What exactly are you looking for?

You have Intergrade already in your library already. You can't purchase what you already have.
                    I thought I had to purchase intergrade.  I'm dumb.  I tried to avoid anything about intergrade to avoid spoilers, but I should have at least looked at how it gets released.
                        Yep.

PS4 > PS5 Intergrade = free but no Yuffie DLC. 

Fresh PS5 Intergrade purchase = $70 but includes Yuffie DLC

Standalone Yuffie DLC = $20
Intergrade is just the FF7 Remake.

Intermission is the Yuffie DLC.

You can always check the Chapter 1 thread.
The intermission dlc doesn't have them, that I could notice, so that's what I'd expect for the next part. The closest thing was fences to prevent you from skipping certain fights.
Me neither, it is telling me I can‚Äôt get it because I already own the PS4 version
    I think you are supposed to search the psn store for ff7 remake upgrade not ff7 intergrade
        Yep, that‚Äôs it. Good catch.
You should be able to upgrade it by going to the page for it and clicking the three dots; I was able to without a disk.
    Yeah when I go to it it says insert disc. Idk thanks for trying to help tho i accidentally purchased it again for 69.99
It wont ever be on ps4.
I highly doubt it's coming to PS4. Series X/S and PC? Sure. but not a last gen console.
Final Fantasy PC ports generally suck.
    Its a bit more complex than that.

The older PC ports are pretty bad but 15 is the most recent one and 15 runs and looks better on PC than on the original ps4 version by a landslide. 

There's at least a decent chance ff7r will have a good port imo. That said, you might wait a long time as intergrade has definitely made it likely the pc port is still a long ways off.
        The version of 15 I played on the PC had horrible hitching, even though my FPS was decent. When I read about it, it was a common issue. I can't remember if it was Steam or Windows Store
            https://youtu.be/MWuRlgFpVIQ

Digital foundry definitely feel it's a substantial improvement
        FF7R and FF15 do not use the same engine. FF15 uses the luminous engine. FF7R uses UE4.
            You are totally right and I honestly don't know why I forgot this and confused myself. Edited my original comment.
Dude just open it and have some fun
    Even then I won‚Äôt be able to play because I can‚Äôt download the new one because I purchased the digital version. I‚Äôm hoping it unlocks at midnight EST, shouldn‚Äôt take more than a few minutes to download on my internet.

I have the physical copy so that I always have a copy of the game, no matter what. It‚Äôs tucked away for safe keeping with my PS1 copy.
        You could just delete the digital version and install the physical, the ps4 recognizes it as two different ones.
            It finally worked, and thankfully my internet is fast enough I was playing within 5m, fully installed in 20. You playing it? DLC is super cool.
                I'll have to wait until its either out on ps4 or when I get the ps5 man. I saw a couple minutes and it looks really great. Have you finished it already?
The way Sony blocks you out of buying bundles and such because you own part of it is weird and confusing
I don't have a disc, I have a digital ps5 but I actually went to the website story page on my computer and it has a countdown timer there.
It‚Äôs literally optimized for 60fps. You just aren‚Äôt used to it. It isn‚Äôt running any faster than it does at 30fps.
    its not running any faster than 30fps? Are you on crack? the whole fucking game is sped up to 60 fps, which means everything is faster. The problem is combat and out of combat dont synce. The dumbtards at square thought that they could give us 60fps without realizing it will fuck up everything non combat. the idiots at square made a 30fps game that dont fit in a 60 fps world. they are dumb idiots. the sooner the feedback gets to them the sooner the lightbulb may possibly go off in their brains.
        That‚Äôs not how FPS works lol. It‚Äôs running at the exact same speed at double the frames. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfaster‚Äù at all. It‚Äôs SMOOTHER. If shit‚Äôs off sync for you, then check your TV settings. That‚Äôs a you-problem.

This isn‚Äôt a KH PS4 situation. At all.
            r u on crack? i just played it and its SHIT. 60 fps is awesome for combat, its not so awesome for the flow of the game and cutscenes that are double speed and look FUCKING REDICULOUS pardon my language, but the game has been ruined. You cant slap 4k and 60fps on top of a 2k 30fps designed game and think you can get away with it. the pacing in the ps5 version is HORENDOUS.
                You‚Äôre the one on crack mate. The conversations and out of combat scenes are the exact same length of time. It just plays more frames in that time, hence 60fps.

The only thing it could be is your getting a similar effect as the ‚Äòsoap opera effect‚Äô when tv‚Äôs have motion stuff on. Check if your TV had that stuff on then turn it off
                    yea which means its FASTER. The scenes outside of combat ARE FASTER which means the 60 fps is ruining the original flow of the game. I played the new version, i could barely read the convos before it moved on. ITS TOO FAST. Combat at 60 fps is GREAT. The entire game at 60 fps IS NOT GREAT.
                        No. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs faster. 1 minute at 30 FPS is the exact same as 1 minute at 60fps. It just has more frames. Making it smoother.

If what you were saying is true, the characters would sound like chipmunks and the music would be all out of whack. And all the animations would be comically funny and it would be plastered everywhere on the internet.

However you‚Äôre wrong. Not sure why you just can‚Äôt admit it rather than make yourself sound like a fool.
                        You are really set on saying dumb stuff over and over aren't you?

Repeat after me: The game is not faster at 60 FPS.
I think you're trolling.
    trolling what? you think im bashing the game on purpose? the fucking game is 2x fast as the ps4 version. there is no flow in the game. did you even play it?
What are you talking about LOL

            I'm jealous! I've even gone as far as replacing the PS5 disk for a new one at the store same issue. I think my 2 week old PS5 is a dud.
I finished a base game before, but didn‚Äôt see it.
It‚Äôs fine and in English playing now
Nope, I only have physical.  I‚Äôd suggest you delete the PS+ one and try downloading it again
    I've deleted all the PS4 versions of the game from my console (I only have the PS5 version I downloaded last night, and when I launch it it says "you need to buy this game first"). Is there a way to permanently delete a game from my PSN digital library as well?
        Go to the game itself and click the 3 dots, make sure you select the right version and then see what happens
Yeah I'm saying it's not midnight local
    I'm guessing local by country? So US defaults to EST, but European countries, Asian countries, etc. Use their local time (or at least one of their timezones).

Pulling that out of my add though.
        Think you're right because people are posting from other countries that it's out
That's what I was thinking. Saying midnight local is only true if you're in EST.
yea it should be coming up, but it'll cost $20 by itself
    Just had a look on the store during my break and saw that it had finally come up and that Intergrade is now playable so I'll download the whole thing and check it out later!
indeed there is! it's an item pack add-on that gives you the three summons
I get it , for me it depends on the game , I was playing FF15 at 60 on my 1080p tv on PC , when I upgraded to my 4K tv I couldn‚Äôt stand neither 1080p blurryness or 4k30 and I ended up paying scalper prices for a 3070 

But for this and for example miles morales , 4k30 felt good , specially since I do love my crispy pixels
    I played miles on 4K 30 and I don‚Äôt remember it looking this bad? But like you said it must be the smoothing.
Nomura directly stated in the First Soldier livestream that in Part 2, Cloud would be running through wide, natural areas. So it would most definitely be open world, though the story might be linear like in OG. Plus I feel like we should have faith in the devs, they seem to know what fans would like to see for FFVIIR and open world is the highest on the wishlist.

Clever!
That's how to unlock the final simulator fight in the original game. Intergrade's stats page counts a new one, with a new enemy intel.

I am also wondering how to unlock it. I've been googling for like 40 minutes, and this is the only comment I've seen of anyone even talking about it.
    Gotcha. Well I guess I'm not sure then.
        I'm guessing you'd need to beat Intermission, and it'll unlock, since that's the only thing left to do if you've got all the others unlocked and beaten
            I'll have to wait to test the theory. I'm working through Intergrade first.
            If you're talking about the extra fights in Intermission I got them by starting chapter 2 on hard mode (once you've beat the game the first time.)
                No, the stats in the main game count an extra fight and enemy intel
its sorta frustrating the sony didnt make this like a more seamless process lmao. you should've seen my morning trying to figure out how to get the ps5 version and then having to get the DLC
I loaded the cloud save through FFVII Remake and the trophies didn't pop. What am I doing wrong?
    Did you upload the saves through the Upload save function within the PS4 version of VII Remake? It‚Äôs within the game, not PS+ Cloud saves.
        Yes, that's what I said.
            I‚Äôm not sure then. Should be as simple as uploading in VIIR | PS4 and then using the Download Save function in VIIR | PS5. That‚Äôs what I did.
                I did the same thing and my save is still not showing on ps5. I retried uploading the save too. I also checked my ps5 save storage and it‚Äôs on the system itself as well but not showing up when I boot the game up. Huge bummer.
Not available for purchase.

I think I have to wait until support opens up.  I think this issue is from the period when they offered ff7 remake for free.  I read that you cannot upgrade from that free content to intergrade.  I don't remember if I added that to the account, and now the account thinks I have that instead of the ff7 remake that I purchased.
    The item on the right is the one you want. It looks like it's already in your library. Just have to download it now. You don't need to purchase the first two.
        That's the ps4 to ps5 upgrade.  I downloaded 80 gigs to see if it did anything.  Nope.
            I'm confused then. What exactly are you looking for?

You have Intergrade already in your library already. You can't purchase what you already have.
                I thought I had to purchase intergrade.  I'm dumb.  I tried to avoid anything about intergrade to avoid spoilers, but I should have at least looked at how it gets released.
                    Yep.

PS4 > PS5 Intergrade = free but no Yuffie DLC. 

Fresh PS5 Intergrade purchase = $70 but includes Yuffie DLC

Standalone Yuffie DLC = $20
I think you are supposed to search the psn store for ff7 remake upgrade not ff7 intergrade
    Yep, that‚Äôs it. Good catch.
Yeah when I go to it it says insert disc. Idk thanks for trying to help tho i accidentally purchased it again for 69.99
Its a bit more complex than that.

The older PC ports are pretty bad but 15 is the most recent one and 15 runs and looks better on PC than on the original ps4 version by a landslide. 

There's at least a decent chance ff7r will have a good port imo. That said, you might wait a long time as intergrade has definitely made it likely the pc port is still a long ways off.
    The version of 15 I played on the PC had horrible hitching, even though my FPS was decent. When I read about it, it was a common issue. I can't remember if it was Steam or Windows Store

Digital foundry definitely feel it's a substantial improvement
    FF7R and FF15 do not use the same engine. FF15 uses the luminous engine. FF7R uses UE4.
        You are totally right and I honestly don't know why I forgot this and confused myself. Edited my original comment.
Even then I won‚Äôt be able to play because I can‚Äôt download the new one because I purchased the digital version. I‚Äôm hoping it unlocks at midnight EST, shouldn‚Äôt take more than a few minutes to download on my internet.

I have the physical copy so that I always have a copy of the game, no matter what. It‚Äôs tucked away for safe keeping with my PS1 copy.
    You could just delete the digital version and install the physical, the ps4 recognizes it as two different ones.
        It finally worked, and thankfully my internet is fast enough I was playing within 5m, fully installed in 20. You playing it? DLC is super cool.
            I'll have to wait until its either out on ps4 or when I get the ps5 man. I saw a couple minutes and it looks really great. Have you finished it already?
its not running any faster than 30fps? Are you on crack? the whole fucking game is sped up to 60 fps, which means everything is faster. The problem is combat and out of combat dont synce. The dumbtards at square thought that they could give us 60fps without realizing it will fuck up everything non combat. the idiots at square made a 30fps game that dont fit in a 60 fps world. they are dumb idiots. the sooner the feedback gets to them the sooner the lightbulb may possibly go off in their brains.
    That‚Äôs not how FPS works lol. It‚Äôs running at the exact same speed at double the frames. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfaster‚Äù at all. It‚Äôs SMOOTHER. If shit‚Äôs off sync for you, then check your TV settings. That‚Äôs a you-problem.

This isn‚Äôt a KH PS4 situation. At all.
        r u on crack? i just played it and its SHIT. 60 fps is awesome for combat, its not so awesome for the flow of the game and cutscenes that are double speed and look FUCKING REDICULOUS pardon my language, but the game has been ruined. You cant slap 4k and 60fps on top of a 2k 30fps designed game and think you can get away with it. the pacing in the ps5 version is HORENDOUS.
            You‚Äôre the one on crack mate. The conversations and out of combat scenes are the exact same length of time. It just plays more frames in that time, hence 60fps.

The only thing it could be is your getting a similar effect as the ‚Äòsoap opera effect‚Äô when tv‚Äôs have motion stuff on. Check if your TV had that stuff on then turn it off
                yea which means its FASTER. The scenes outside of combat ARE FASTER which means the 60 fps is ruining the original flow of the game. I played the new version, i could barely read the convos before it moved on. ITS TOO FAST. Combat at 60 fps is GREAT. The entire game at 60 fps IS NOT GREAT.
                    No. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs faster. 1 minute at 30 FPS is the exact same as 1 minute at 60fps. It just has more frames. Making it smoother.

If what you were saying is true, the characters would sound like chipmunks and the music would be all out of whack. And all the animations would be comically funny and it would be plastered everywhere on the internet.

However you‚Äôre wrong. Not sure why you just can‚Äôt admit it rather than make yourself sound like a fool.
                    You are really set on saying dumb stuff over and over aren't you?

Repeat after me: The game is not faster at 60 FPS.
trolling what? you think im bashing the game on purpose? the fucking game is 2x fast as the ps4 version. there is no flow in the game. did you even play it?
Wow....I am a moron.
    We all have those days. It doesn't help with Square naming things like INTERgrade and INTERmission.
        Yeah i guess i just need 238day/12...errr what were we talking about again?
    The marketing was super weird. Most people thought the ps5 upgrade didn't have a name and the dlc was intergrade. But intergrade is actually the upgrade and yuffie is intermission
In Zack‚Äôs timeline, there should be another Cloud as well since they were both seen alive together at the end of the original ending.
    Zack died in the outskirts of midgar. It doesn't make sense that he'd be holding the buster sword that cloud clearly has. I don't think we're seeing an alternate timeline, I think he's just dead and doesn't realize it.
        Some people think he's in the lifestream, which is plausible. Another theory is that Zack surviving his battle has altered the timeline, which since the party was in the Whispers dimension when they defeated them, were unaffected by the change. So Cloud would still have the buster sword handed to him by Zack while the Zack who never died would have his. Or he's in another timeline completely, it's one of those 3 probably.
            Why do we even have this alternate timeline/dimension thing going around? I feel like it has no bearing.
                Because of the nature of the previous game, having the Whispers a totally non existent thing in the OG game be pretty prominent. When you bring up things like destiny and fate and changing that, people will have ideas pertaining where to go with it. No one knows where this remake is going, it'll probably follow the OG's story to a point, but Zack himself is probably the main factor on how much it does, maybe he's a ghost maybe he's not, it's all up in the air.
                    Interesting. That's weird lol. The game is definitely not in some alternate timeline I think people are just running with the idea but only time will tell.
                    I‚Äôm not sure how credible this is but this is from an Inverse article:

‚ÄúWe wanted to have the last boss fight take place at the highway in Midgar, which arises questions that I cannot answer," Game Director Tetsuya Nomura said in an interview featured in Final Fantasy VII Remake Ultimania. "There is a character who‚Äôs alive, which leads to a great mystery." This particular quote makes it seem like that battle had to happen on the outskirts of Midgar for some reason, and that reason is linked to "a character who's alive." Other tidbits from Ultimania claim he went missing five years ago, and he's referred to in both the past and present tense, further implying that he's MIA instead of KIA.‚Äù
                Yeah man beats me, FFVII Remake should have been completed for the PS4, but they are milking this game, if an alternate timeline do exist the story of FFVII becomes convoluted.
                    Ive played through the game multiple times and I just don't at all see why we're even talking about it. It's not a thing. I'm glad they're milking it. They could put it in 20, 20 hour installations and I'd gobble them all up. Ff7 freak lol

Happy cakeday, sailor.
Thank you I will see if I can do that when I get home. Didn‚Äôt think it would be two separate games. I thought it would just update over the previous game.
    Nah. The PS5 conversions are weird like that. If you press Options on the game you can select PS4 or PS5, when you have both installed. By default the PS5 version installs alongside the PS4 version
        You're awesome! Thanks so much!
I'm jealous! It's frustrating knowing I have everything I need but it's just not working.
    That sucks, I've finished the DLC chapters and a couple of the main story chapters and haven't had a single bug, crash or even a frame drop from what I can tell.

Other tidbits from Ultimania claim he went missing five years ago, and he's referred to in both the past and present tense, further implying that he's MIA instead of KIA.‚Äù
        Yeah man beats me, FFVII Remake should have been completed for the PS4, but they are milking this game, if an alternate timeline do exist the story of FFVII becomes convoluted.
            Ive played through the game multiple times and I just don't at all see why we're even talking about it. It's not a thing. I'm glad they're milking it. They could put it in 20, 20 hour installations and I'd gobble them all up. Ff7 freak lol

Happy cakeday, sailor.
You're awesome! Thanks so much!
I'm jealous! I've even gone as far as replacing the PS5 disk for a new one at the store same issue. I think my 2 week old PS5 is a dud.
I'll have to wait to test the theory. I'm working through Intergrade first.
If you're talking about the extra fights in Intermission I got them by starting chapter 2 on hard mode (once you've beat the game the first time.)
    No, the stats in the main game count an extra fight and enemy intel
I‚Äôm not sure then. Should be as simple as uploading in VIIR | PS4 and then using the Download Save function in VIIR | PS5. That‚Äôs what I did.
    I did the same thing and my save is still not showing on ps5. I retried uploading the save too. I also checked my ps5 save storage and it‚Äôs on the system itself as well but not showing up when I boot the game up. Huge bummer.
I'm confused then. What exactly are you looking for?

You have Intergrade already in your library already. You can't purchase what you already have.
    I thought I had to purchase intergrade.  I'm dumb.  I tried to avoid anything about intergrade to avoid spoilers, but I should have at least looked at how it gets released.
        Yep.

PS4 > PS5 Intergrade = free but no Yuffie DLC. 

Fresh PS5 Intergrade purchase = $70 but includes Yuffie DLC

Standalone Yuffie DLC = $20
I'll have to wait until its either out on ps4 or when I get the ps5 man. I saw a couple minutes and it looks really great. Have you finished it already?
You‚Äôre the one on crack mate. The conversations and out of combat scenes are the exact same length of time. It just plays more frames in that time, hence 60fps.

The only thing it could be is your getting a similar effect as the ‚Äòsoap opera effect‚Äô when tv‚Äôs have motion stuff on. Check if your TV had that stuff on then turn it off
    yea which means its FASTER. The scenes outside of combat ARE FASTER which means the 60 fps is ruining the original flow of the game. I played the new version, i could barely read the convos before it moved on. ITS TOO FAST. Combat at 60 fps is GREAT. The entire game at 60 fps IS NOT GREAT.
        No. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs faster. 1 minute at 30 FPS is the exact same as 1 minute at 60fps. It just has more frames. Making it smoother.

If what you were saying is true, the characters would sound like chipmunks and the music would be all out of whack. And all the animations would be comically funny and it would be plastered everywhere on the internet.

However you‚Äôre wrong. Not sure why you just can‚Äôt admit it rather than make yourself sound like a fool.
        You are really set on saying dumb stuff over and over aren't you?

Repeat after me: The game is not faster at 60 FPS.
Why do we even have this alternate timeline/dimension thing going around? I feel like it has no bearing.
    Because of the nature of the previous game, having the Whispers a totally non existent thing in the OG game be pretty prominent. When you bring up things like destiny and fate and changing that, people will have ideas pertaining where to go with it. No one knows where this remake is going, it'll probably follow the OG's story to a point, but Zack himself is probably the main factor on how much it does, maybe he's a ghost maybe he's not, it's all up in the air.
        Interesting. That's weird lol. The game is definitely not in some alternate timeline I think people are just running with the idea but only time will tell.
        I‚Äôm not sure how credible this is but this is from an Inverse article:

‚ÄúWe wanted to have the last boss fight take place at the highway in Midgar, which arises questions that I cannot answer," Game Director Tetsuya Nomura said in an interview featured in Final Fantasy VII Remake Ultimania.
