[[Why are hextech chests never available in event shops (but the keys are)]]


Just occurred to me that while almost every other type of loot/accessory is in the event shops (for purchase by tokens), Hextech Chests are not. It's extra strange that the keys **are** available to purchase, since they kind of go hand-in-hand with the chests. Since it's very well known that some players have a large excess of chests (event shop works great for them!), while others (like me) have a large excess of keys, it baffles me that one group of players have the option to equalize during event shops, but others don't. 

Any thoughts as to why this is? I can't for the life of me think of a good reason.

Long answer, Profits.
    Back in my day we had no chests and the only way to get skins was to pay for them Oldge

    I dont get the issue if you play enough you have a massive backlog of chests. I just need keys.
        Yeah? So you think everyone just has tons of chests?
            No, im just saying they are given plenty and easily if you do want them. Especially if you try to get them. Keys not really.
                Not quite as easy as you think to get them, but sure.
                    To get as many as i have. Sure. To have more chests than keys? Very easy. If youre not a onetrick at least.
                        So you are assuming everyone is in the same boat as you? Because I can assure you, Most people will stick to a handful of characters. MAYBE a dozen at most.
                            So 12 chests per season. Thats pretty good already lol. Are you swimming in keys? And no im assuming people get less than me.
Cause they have Orbs rather than chests... Keys are there as an extra to waste points on or for players who aren't spammed by key shards.
    And orbs are better since it's a guaranteed skin shard, while a chest gives you a chance for a skin shard, ward shard, emote, icon, etc.
        Emotes ðŸ¤®
        Yeah but if you are stacked with chests like some of my friends, keys are wey better cause a key is 60 and an orb is 200. A chest has a ~50% chance for a skin shard and you also can get a 2nd chest and key and or mystic essence.
They actually WERE in event shops, but Riot removed them.

They were cheap enough where it was more worth to get as many chests as possible instead of orbs or using tokens for whatever else you wanted. And since it's techinally easier to get keys than chests( you don't need S-/S/S+ for keys), it was more worth to have dozens of chests over anything else.
    When was this? I do not recall that at all
You are guaranteed boxes by performance and the champion you play. Key shards are just randomly available by log in and good behavior. Buying them with event tokens is another and more consistent way of getting keys.
    Keys are only kinda random, you can earn 3 per week to match the chest, but it's weighted to games played not getting an S rank in your party once a week. Also, honor capsule's use your sored keys to reward you and give BE for any deficits.
I have 11 keys.   
I have 0 chests.  
ðŸ˜”
    Beginner numbers, I retired with 48 keys.
        I just saw a screenshot with 175 so clearly I have work to do
            Oh shit, I'm just a dolphin compared to those Leviathans lol
        just hit 100 recently
    doesn't that mean you just need to play new champs and get S rank?
To stack more keys in you inventory of course. When you have 70 keys and get RP for skins or pass or whatever, you are more likely to buy chests with what remain of your RP.
I have 60 key fragments + 23 keys and counting never gonna go down at this rate
You can farm chests all you want by just playing and getting S ranks on champs each season, up to 4 and then another each week. Keys are distinctively limited by random time-gates, honor levels, and who knows what else, but it's definitely hard limited to less than 1 full key a week excluding one-time honor rewards.

Having an excess of keys should never be a problem because, at this very moment, you can queue up with a new champion in any(?) mode and play for kda/cs and get a chest instantly, and if you've already maxed out your chests, you shouldn't be bottlenecked by keys.
The system is designed so you have more chests than keys, itll end up like that eventually for you too.

        holy shit and i thought i had a lot with ~75
            Bruh how. I always have so many boxes. My smurf has like 50 boxes and no keys even lol.
        Do you play one champ or?
            no I max out my chests each month
                Didn't they design the system so you get 4 chests and 12 key fragments max per month?
    Yeah I have 12 keys right now and 0 chests, been like that for awhile
        I forgot about the stupid chest limit they have where you can only get like 4 per month or whatever it is. Keys also get those honor capsules :p my b
    I always have more keys than chests
        Do you play as many champions as possible? IIRC you can get 1 chest per champ per season.
            Absolutely
                Now that I think about it. There is a cap on earning chests vs keys which you can also earn in honor capsules so I think you're right chests are harder to earn if you play a lot. 

For casuals I'd expect more chests than keys
                    It's also harder to get chests if you don't have *skilled* friends. Most of my friends are much lower mmr than I am, so if we play together and I drag their mmr up, they get stomped. So while other people are like, "oh yeah, just play with friends, if anyone in the premade gets an S it counts" -- yeah, that's not helpful if your friends are never getting S ranks precisely *because* they're playing with you.

(I also have a fairly narrow champion pool, so I get maybe 10-15 chests per year from my own champs and that's it.)
                        I just play aram someone tends to get s lol
                            Yeah I try that, but the problem is that I still have that same narrow champion pool and of the champions I'm maybe decent at best at, a lot of them are *heavily* nerfed on aram making it even harder.
                                The trick to getting s on aram is farming no joke
                                    Even then, not every champion (and every comp) is made equal. Sometimes you just don't have the insta-nuke clear of your allies and you can't really do much.
    Nah, that's not always true; see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1bk8b8z/what_can_i_do_with_extra_keys/) where there are plenty of players and scenarios where you keep accumulating more and more keys than chests over time (some commenters had built up to over 100+ extra keys).
    Yeah Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s the opposite you will always have more keys than chests
        I never had more keys than chests ever.
If you are not just grinding soloq with a very small champ pool and play with friends for fun often enough (with varied champs) youâ€˜ll get more chests as you donâ€˜t need to get the S yourself, a premade getting it is wnoigh
            i wish that was the case, if you get all the chests available to your account you still have a cooldown period before you have even a singular chest available on your profile tab under your picture.
                Yeah Iâ€˜m almost always on 0, but still donâ€˜t get enough keys (unless i go for only keys during events) to reduce the amount of chest i have (it fluctuates a bit depending on how much i play though (like playing more they might be more or less stable or even slightly decrease, but if I play normally they slowly increase))
                    yeah i feel you on that xD
            No. You get more keys just be playing games decently and being a human being. Honoring someone give you keys, grind and honor someone every post-game and you'll get more keys eventually.
                There's a cap on both Chests and keys that you can get. Chests are shown in your profile, keys aren't but you can get a maximum of 12 key pieces per month. So 3 key pieces or a whole key every week.

The system is still designed to give you more chests than keys. Surprisingly, key progress isn't really based on honor, but rather just time that you spend on the game. Chests always store up up to 4, so you can chill for 3 weeks and then get all 4 chests in one sitting. You can't do that with key pieces because they require more time and you get them only if you are active, so not playing League for like a day or two will halt your key pieces progress while not affecting chest progress at all. That's why, eventually, all players will have more chests than keys UNLESS they play every single day, then both key gain and chest gain will be the same.
                I am already doing this but Iâ€˜m not playing as much as I did back in the day 
but even back then iâ€˜ve been as high as 30 chests before using all free event tokens on keys for a few months to get down to 0 but now iâ€˜m back in my normal routine of getting an orb + some keys woth the leftover tokens and Iâ€˜m back at around 10 chests
                    Well as you said, you mostly play with premades. Premades slow down Honor progress, ofcourse rewards to.
Edit: read it wrong mb.
        Two friends have 32 keys and 0 chests. I have 19 chests and never enough keys lmao. But I was banned for a month when they were released. Took forever to be redeemed lmao. Lesson learned be nice if I was nice things
        I always have leftover boxes
        Not if you play a wide variety of champs. You can get 1 chest per champ each season, no?
            You can only get a max of 52 chests per year because there's a cooldown on it, so it's not one for every champ. While there's no limit on keys afaik.
    i literally have over 70 keys with no chests to spend it on

if you arent toxic, its super easy to fucking drown in keys
        I stopped playing as much so I typically only hit honor 4 tbh
    Me crying in my 40 chests
        Same bro I got like 26 chests waiting for keys lol

That's why, eventually, all players will have more chests than keys UNLESS they play every single day, then both key gain and chest gain will be the same.
    I am already doing this but Iâ€˜m not playing as much as I did back in the day 
but even back then iâ€˜ve been as high as 30 chests before using all free event tokens on keys for a few months to get down to 0 but now iâ€˜m back in my normal routine of getting an orb + some keys woth the leftover tokens and Iâ€˜m back at around 10 chests
        Well as you said, you mostly play with premades. Premades slow down Honor progress, ofcourse rewards to.
Edit: read it wrong mb.
You can only get a max of 52 chests per year because there's a cooldown on it, so it's not one for every champ. While there's no limit on keys afaik.
Not quite as easy as you think to get them, but sure.
    To get as many as i have. Sure. To have more chests than keys? Very easy. If youre not a onetrick at least.
        So you are assuming everyone is in the same boat as you? Because I can assure you, Most people will stick to a handful of characters. MAYBE a dozen at most.
            So 12 chests per season. Thats pretty good already lol. Are you swimming in keys? And no im assuming people get less than me.
Didn't they design the system so you get 4 chests and 12 key fragments max per month?
Now that I think about it. There is a cap on earning chests vs keys which you can also earn in honor capsules so I think you're right chests are harder to earn if you play a lot. 

For casuals I'd expect more chests than keys
    It's also harder to get chests if you don't have *skilled* friends. Most of my friends are much lower mmr than I am, so if we play together and I drag their mmr up, they get stomped. So while other people are like, "oh yeah, just play with friends, if anyone in the premade gets an S it counts" -- yeah, that's not helpful if your friends are never getting S ranks precisely *because* they're playing with you.

(I also have a fairly narrow champion pool, so I get maybe 10-15 chests per year from my own champs and that's it.)
        I just play aram someone tends to get s lol
            Yeah I try that, but the problem is that I still have that same narrow champion pool and of the champions I'm maybe decent at best at, a lot of them are *heavily* nerfed on aram making it even harder.
                The trick to getting s on aram is farming no joke
                    Even then, not every champion (and every comp) is made equal. Sometimes you just don't have the insta-nuke clear of your allies and you can't really do much.
Yeah Iâ€˜m almost always on 0, but still donâ€˜t get enough keys (unless i go for only keys during events) to reduce the amount of chest i have (it fluctuates a bit depending on how much i play though (like playing more they might be more or less stable or even slightly decrease, but if I play normally they slowly increase))
    yeah i feel you on that xD
There's a cap on both Chests and keys that you can get. Chests are shown in your profile, keys aren't but you can get a maximum of 12 key pieces per month. So 3 key pieces or a whole key every week.

The system is still designed to give you more chests than keys. Surprisingly, key progress isn't really based on honor, but rather just time that you spend on the game. Chests always store up up to 4, so you can chill for 3 weeks and then get all 4 chests in one sitting. You can't do that with key pieces because they require more time and you get them only if you are active, so not playing League for like a day or two will halt your key pieces progress while not affecting chest progress at all.
