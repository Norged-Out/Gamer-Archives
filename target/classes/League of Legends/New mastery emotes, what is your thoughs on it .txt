[[New mastery emotes, what is your thoughs on it ]]

I think I'll be using mastery A LOT less now, not only would I like to know if you liked it, but I'm also very curious to know how it was approved internally, how an entire team of artists agreed that it was even aesthetically pleasing?This new mastery is UGLY.

 You know what's funny is that whenever riot makes a mistake, it's always without consulting the players. It was like that with the mythical item system, it was like that with the changes to the raids (the problem of getting less pdl the higher you went, even if you already had a high mmr). Seriously, am I crazy, or did no one think the masteries were ugly? seriously, are there enough people who think the new ones are superior to change? what if I don't want to change? it's just sad.

 Sometimes it also seems that riot doesn't have much quality control, which makes sense, as people are being fired and the game has to release at least 3 skins per patch, sometimes more, and at events the standard is now 10. It's clear that the quality of even the splash arts has dropped, where now everyone has the same face and the same pose;

and worst of all the new ones doesn't even get THAT better by leveling up.

even if just a normal emote, I want to keep my mastery old. 


It looks so cheap...
    It just came to my mind it kinda looks like Sailor Moonâ€™s brooch that she uses to transform.
Where are the **W I N G S**?!?

It looks too small without them
    it has ^^wings instead of **WINGS**
        LMAO
Mobile legends called, they want their masteries back
    is really that similar? bruh...LoL has fallen deeper than I thought
the sound doesnt feel satisfying.... esp comparing old mastery 7 to this new mastery 7 and above
Riot legit just ignoring all feedback on the new mastery emotes lmfao
    Well they ignore A LOT of thing, mythics since beggining was hated i took almost 2 years to then remove, skarners rework too. I doubt they will go back at this point.
They look soulless and cheap. The current design is iconic and didn't need to be changed. They could easily have done mastery 8+ with the same style and they would look fine.
I don't understand why they would replace the current ones when they're so iconic
yah they're terrible l.ol
Hard Agree.

90% mistakes that Riot makes are changes that they just ship to the game without consulting players and don't hear feedback.

Old Hextech drake, Rengar Swimming Q, Font change, mastery. Everytime, and skins keep coming out and I'm always less interested in any of them. They feel uninspired and just sent out to meet a quota. 

Though I understand a big part of Riots funds comes from in-game transactions that are only aesthetic, so they need new stuff coming out fast, it doesn't feel nice for Cho'gath to get a WALKING CITY skin with an incredible splash art and look like absolute garbage ingame just to meet a quota.

Project skins keep coming out yet the feel worse and worse. Lost hope in League some time ago, still enjoy some ARAM and Arena, and hoping that the MMORPG is a blast when it comes out, but of course it was delayed again.
    I wish the MMO was delayed, would come earlier haha, reset is probably more than just a delay,
I'm out of the loop.

Aren't they changing masteries to go beyond level 7?

Which level does this represent? I'm under the impression it'll get a lot cooler if you've got hundreds of thousands/millions of points.
    it stops on 11 ðŸ’€ visualy the rest will rise only the numbers... WOW
        Wait they seriously don't add any more details past 11? What was the point of an infinitely scaling mastery display? No one is about to care about a number showing up, they want something actually flashy lol. 

The titles are just pre-existing titles of champs slapped into the title system from challenges, so even though it's an improvement it's legit the lowest effort highest return change they could make lol.

If the only scaling the new mastery emotes have post 11 is the number this will be such a waste of potential and time.
        How is that worse than what we have now which stops on 7?
            Cause they gave us the idea of a rework not a 4 number upgrade and obvious downgrade of it all, its just annoying to be told HEY WERE MAKING IT BETTER and then we all hate it , and knowing theyre not going to do anything about it kinda just finishes it off for us
            cause the emote is ugly.... doesn't feel worth of being the symbol of masterize a champ
    It gets to a point and then just has an ever increasing number underneath it
This is so so bad from an objective point, it's just a obvious downgrade
Time to check out smite 2 I guess
    aww yes mastery emote, the straw that broke the camels back
        The final straw
            The strawiest of straws
                It's the strawiest!!!
Yasuo is DEAD
The circle makes no fucking sense. Put the portrait in there or something.
    Yeah if they had some form of design to not just make it a flat circle and only a circle then cool, but till then its just hot garbage

Better?
Looks sterile and without any semblance of personality.

The new ones lack the "League of Legends"-ness of the previous ones.

If you're gonna change what wasn't broken then you need to convince me that the new one is more deserving to be the definitive version than the one it's replacing. This didn't do that for me.
Its so disgustingly bad the person that greenlit it deserves to be fired
    I agree
ofc it's a yasuo
Stinky caca poo poo
They suck so bad I almost downvoted this post for simply mentioning them
    LMAO
The new system is cool the icons themselves look like fiver shit
Do we have a date yet to when itâ€™s coming live?
    if is on PBE 2 weeks to came for live.
Thoughts on how they look? If you hate your playerbase so much, why not just perma all of them instead of doing this shit?
It's just not... like.... wide enough? It's just a big circle. The wings make the original mastery really wide. These just don't feel wide. They should feel wide.
I care as much as i care about the chat font being changed, I'll foam out of my mouth the first day then by next week I'll have moved on and gotten used to it

Happened when they changed the game's icon, the cool ranks into the shitty shields, then the cool shields to the shitty wings, when they added the emotes which were "super mobile game", and so on

Realistically its a nothing burger
New ones suck. Lemme use tha actual ones
Another unwanted change added lmao, when will they actually listen to the community and rework the client completely?
What? Dont' tell me their replacing the current sick looking mastery, to what ever tf that is. That looks like a level emote, som cheap bs.
    they will
Ugly as shit, but that's what happens when you do a "I gave $1, $5 and $100 to 3 different fiverr artists to create new emotes in 24 hours" challenge and then pick the worst.
Well it looks ass but I dont use it most of the time anyway so whatever. But yeah Riot has no idea what they are doing again imo.
IT LOOKS SO DISGUSTING WHAT ARE THEY DOING
looks like shit
What happened to just building on what was already there?
i use mastery emote like twice a year and i have enemy emotes turned off by default, so I don't care for the change.
> how an entire team of artists agreed that it was even aesthetically pleasing?

Doesn't need a whole team, it more thematically fits with the other stuff like honour levels and profile borders, its called unifying the design
    That would be the argument *if it did.* Which it doesn't.
        Oh?

Looks like it matches the style of the honour popups just fine to me and that it matches the art styles of the profile borders

Do you not have any of the later level up borders unlocked?

So yeah looks thematically on point to me
            I have all of them unlocked, and these look nothing like them. They vary much more in detail, and the ones with gold have more on the wings than the circle. Nevermind that there's that big ass circle that your icon is in, but is blank with these.
            Hell, I actually have no idea how you think it matches the look of any of them, since they have different themes. *Maybe*, if we squint and recolored them they'd be a little like the 200 and 250 ones, but even that's a stretch.
    Unifying WITH WHAT EXACTLY? cause as far I know SR doesnt have connections with the lore anymore. and even so.... IS JUST UGLY
        he said it, unifying with other stuff like honor levels and profile borders, rank borders, and even cursor. This has nothing to do with lore. Riot was simplifying looks of everything for a long time now
I love it
    care to say why?
    Yeah tbh same. Change is good. I just think they need to revamp the over user interface out of lobby
>it's always without consulting the players

Reddit is not "the players".

And it has already been discussed big time:

https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/s/wiSjEo8iM3
    thats why I said without consulting the players there are no survey, no client voting, zero. they just came in there season map and said "will change, thats it" "its your loss" and leave the room...
        And why should they ask?

Every game is making changes and i dont think any dev always have to ask.
I don't care.  Balance the game first and I'll like it
    its fair.
I dont get whats the problem is, Riot was simplifying design of everything for a long time now, its just another thing they did
I mean what did you expect , until we have a proper , competent balance team i am not waiting or expecting anything good from this company , the only ones who are competent in their job is the ones who make cinematics and songs
    ok, you got me, thats is an argument. XD
It looks better, this subreddit is having a mass schizo episode if they think that yellow piss stain looks better.

The only acceptable feedback is that it's smaller and maybe that it's missing the blue fire and other particles.

But the badge itself is straight up better in all senses.
    call others schizo when YOU are the one who "literally only play ziggs".... (it pops up when is a green  thing on your name) ok but even if is sh\*t I still have the right to show my opinion .
