[[Something I made for all those dogs waiting for their owners to come back]]





Why would you do this to me?
    Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this.
        I met that guys girlfriend and she called him so we could ask him questions. He said that they were filming some stupid funny video and it was getting boring content wise so his friend just wacked him and that was his natural reaction
            this actually makes it funnier somehow
            Lol I always wondered what the context of that video was.
        Man with taste
    now watch the futurama one
        I’m walking on sunshine !

        Ditto, came here to also make this protest.
            Yea that was a VERY sad scene. But at least we later find out that he did go back to his dog later on.
        Well that scene is based off of a true Japanese story called hatchiko it is the story of a shiba inu waiting for his dead owner to come back and ended up dying due to the fact it was sitting there with no food or water there is actually a statue of hatchiko look it up
Cool vid, Still depressing.
    Especially the part at the end where I thought everything was going to be fine :(
        But no. Feelings crushed.
            I’m never getting a dog in hardcore after seeing this
                I quit playing after my dog died in my last survival :(
                    That happened to me and coming home everyday without my friend was very hard
                        My dog was named Henrick. I had him for 3 years since I didn’t really make other worlds. He died fighting off the hoard of zombies that killed me. After I respawned, all I saw was that horrible message that said something like “dog eaten by zombies”. I stopped playing survival for a while after that, and spent my days in creative making a funeral for him and a giant grave, with a lot of other doggo friends sitting around it to keep him company. I know he’s not a real dog but at the time I didn’t have any pets, so he felt real and being a kid and having a bigger imagination made him seem even more real. He was always so brave and will forever be my best boy.
                            Shit man I’m gonna be a legal adult in a few months and I still cry a little bit whenever my pets die in Minecraft
                                Happy cake day!
                                    Thank you! Have some virtual cake! 😄🍰
                            I have a hardcore world that got corrupted and cut my base in half. The first thing i checked was my dig and cat. They're alive and well.
                            thats.... wow
                            :((
                            This comment made me cry twice. Don't listen to anyone who says otherwise, because it doesn't matter if he wasn't "real", you had a real companion for years and he died sacrificing himself for you. When you lose something or someone you love the medium doesn't matter. Rest easy, Henrick.
                            Rest in peace Henrick, you courageous virtual canine!
                            Dude that shit fucked me up holy crap like that’s just ugh... I’m sorry for your loss bud
                            RIP Henrick, the very bestest boy
                            I've never played Minecraft, but this hit me right in the feelers. Rest in peace, Henrick, you died a hero.
                            I relate to the pain of losing a dog but not on this level.  However losing my horse on red dead 2 almost made me cry.
                            My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
                    At least he died instead of being left to wait... most likely forever.
                    I’m not sure if I should up vote or down vote because I totally agree minded to his name was crypto :(
                        Omg is that after crypto the super dog? I haven't thought of that show in years.
                            Krypto*
                                Lol
                    My horse I’ve had in my survival world since the beginning just died to a creeper attack and now I’m mad
                    That’s a valid reason to quit
                I got one, but only because I found him in my empty sheep pen :( 
RIP my 20 sheep
                No. Having a dog is great. Just if you do, careful not to fall into a machine that deep freezes you for a thousand years and leave him there all alone.
                I have a dog and two cats in hardcore. 

Let's hope we won't die!
                DW it'll prob die before you

                    do you want them to suffer after you're gone like this?

            What I do during these is watch them through, then at the beginning pause it and everything is fine

Im not crying! YOU'RE CRYING!
    If it makes you feel better, time freezes in game when you quit, so really all the dogos are just in suspended animation.
        Forever.

After watching Adventure Time and finishing that show, was told I should watch  Steven Universe, after finding out more about this song, I think I'll get started on that...
                            You absolutely should, it's a great show and if you enjoyed adventure Time, I'm sure you'll like it. But the movie (where the song's from) has MAJOR spoilers, I really recommend not looking up anything more and first watching the five seasons of the series.
                                Or else you’ll be one of those people who gave the movie a bad review because they didn’t understand wtf is going on in the movie.
        And then she smiled, that's what I'm after...
    I cant wait for my minecraft dog to come after me with a lightsaber scythe in 6000 years
        With black tear marks, the dog is grey and not cute anymore and the color is upside down and red eyes.
            What is he part of the forshaken is wow?
    My exact thoughts, damn what a scene.
        Glad I reeled in some SU fans lol
            There's DOZENS OF US!!
        What a movie! I was annoyed at the character right until then, then suddenly I had to rewatch it 3 times.
            what movie are you talking about?
                Steven universe: The movie. Great show and great movie, I suggest u watch some
                    I’ll check it out, thanks!
                        The show is a coming of age story though and starts with the main character as an annoying 10 year old. Lots of people can't get through the first couple episodes.

If you're having trouble, maybe start with the movie (though this would spoil a LOT) or a plot-only episode guide. Steven's so much more paletteable when you know what he grows into.
    Stop it stop it OP’s video made me sad enough ahhh
        Steven Universe the Movie made me so sad. Not just the plot, but also because it was the beginning and end of an era in that show.

            Thanks!
                Just a heads up, the first half of season 1 is rough (season 1 is 26 10 minute episodes) but sadly not skippable due to how much world building happens in the episodes.  If you can power through them  you'll be treated to an amazing show.
        Here. (Spoilers for the movie though if you haven’t watch it yet.) https://youtu.be/ACOdhT82cc8
-
And heres the movie, need internet to watch: https://kimcartoon.to/Cartoon/Steven-Universe-The-Movie/Full?id=93183
            stevenuniver.se would be a less risky choice
    Is Steven Universe any good? When I saw it first came out I thought it looked pretty stupid so I just dropped it
        It has come a looooong way since then, trust me
        Yeah it’s come a long way and it’s fire now, if you wanna start try to avoid anything about the movie because that will spoil literally everything.
        First half of the first season is pretty rough.  By about episode 20-25 it gets more bearable, and gets an actual story, character progression, etc.

It really picks up a lot by the end of season 1. Definitely worth pushing through the slow/abnoxious start.
        I had to grit through a few episodes before I started liking it as it felt too childish at the beginning, but honestly, it was worth it, so many characters, so much character development and the storyline is amazing, and then the movie that just got released, brilliant I cant stop listening to all the songs and have rewatched the movie multiple times already. 

So just grit through the first episodes and it gets better and better. It doesn't have 5 seasons and a movie for nothing ;D
    Spinel 😭😭

That isn’t the same seed.
    Why'd OP have to go and make the Minecraft version of the episode about Fry's dog.
        I was actually crying by the end of that episode of futurama. 

Aw shit. Here we go again
            I was slowly watching through all the episodes of Futurama as a kid on Netflix when I first found the show (this was probably about 9 years ago).

My dog, who was 17 years old (I was 13, so we’d had her my whole life) had reached the point where we decided it was time to put her down. No real quality of life for her anymore. Vet came over and did the deed at home. Suffice it to say, I was heartbroken. 

Go upstairs to my room to watch Futurama, thinking it’ll cheer me up and get my mind off of everything. This was literally mere hours after my dog had died. Cue Fry’s dog episode. 

Had to take a break from the show for probably a week, fucked me up so hard.
                I just read this and now I'm crying
                Jesus Christ dude, thats rough.
                Fucking damn i started this episode and my friend was watching it with me and idk exactly how the episode went but he saw the dog and went “man wouldn’t it suck if this episode took a sad turn” and me and him chuckled and then it took a sad turn and we were crying
                Jesus, that ep fucks me up and I've never really had to go through it. <time travel hug>
                Reminds me of when my dad passed away. A week or two after I decided to rewatch Scrubs. First fucking episode, the ending scene where the man had passed away in his hospital bed. It looked exactly like how my dad had passed away in his hospital bed. The man even looked a little like my dad. Had to take a break from that show for a good month, and I still can't watch that first episode of Scrubs for this reason.
            Yeah, me too. Don't worry about it.
                I was expecting the music when I unmuted the audio
                    “So this is the power of Ultra Instinct?”
            What do you think fry? Wanna go round again?
            Talk about it man
            So say we all.
            Same
        I cried while watching that episode. Why did you remind me?
        THIS JUST MAKES IT WORSE DUDE NOW IM EVEN MORE SAD
        Which is also the true story of Hachiko, who has that nice statue
        Bruh that futurama episode i was thinking the same thing 😭
        If it takes forever,
I will wait for you.
For a thousand summers,
I will wait for you.
    He could have shown someone coming back home tho
        The worst part was when the house came back together I thought for sure the owner was going to come back then no he’s dead and that was just the afterlife, how dare you play me like that OP!
            Oh no, dog afterlife is just waiting for your owner to come back for all eternity?

        I like those but they make all sources of light pink so I stopped using them. I’m probably just using an old version
            You can edit the light colors. You probably had red in RGB too high.
Bruh my feels

Me waiting for my dad lmao
    Damn, I know this is a joke (or not) but it kind of made me really sad because my dad actually left when I was in middle school and this post is how I felt growing up without him.
        Aw dude, I hope you are better now
            I am doing a lot better! I really really loved him a lot and I eventually learned to let him go and let him be happy.
                The way you said it in the original post it sounded like he just left spontaneously one day while you were at school. But if he broke up with your Mom I kind of understand more lol
                    He did spontaneously leave. Well, my mom saw it coming but she tried to shield us from what was going on behind the scenes so when he did leave, we were like, oh fuck okay. The next ten years, we only got to see him a few days out of every year, because he was so busy with his new wife. Rip.
                        You sound pretty mature about the whole situation. My parents got divorced, remarried and divorced again. I was bitter until I took them off the "parent pedestal" and realized they were just human. And stupid.
        My dad left too when I was 4. Few years ago I heard he was at mental hospital...
            My dad went to jail for a year. When he came out, he got told to never contact me again. That happened when I was 5. I got told about it when I was 25.
                Oh wow, I'm sorry! I see my dad 
1 or 2 times a year:)

Edit: My mom never told me where dad was, I heard this from my sister, she thought it was a good time for me to know
            I read your comment as:
> “My dad left too when I was 4. This was a few years ago.” 

I was very confused.

But in all seriousness, so sorry to hear that.
                Haha it's okay, I still get chance to see him:)
        I feel ya. My mom passed away when I was a sophomore in highschool. Didn't know what happened until the day after. Last thing I said to her, "you want some more pizza" instead y, "I love you". So now I say those words every chance I get. Not the pizza one, the "I love you" words.
            Fuck, that must have been so rough, I’m sorry. I try to say “I love you” to my mom at least once everyday.
                It was. Than 2012, cat who was my brother passed away in my hands at Dec 25th 12:02am in my arms. Talk about a rough Christmas present from Satan. Anyway, I moved on and wrote a song about my losses. I didn't forget, just moved on. 
Oops, making this more sad, my bad. Here, have a [happy song](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XxLkEDzIoOGpO6KOYG9dV6155GpXROK10RltniC1leo/edit?usp=drivesdk) I wish I could sing.
        Same here, but now I have kids of my own and they're getting all the attention they deserve. Hopefully you'll get a chance to be there for someone else. When you do, turn all those negative experiences into something good. You'll look back on those middle-school days differently.
        Hey man, me too. My parents weren't together after I was born, but I saw my dad every week. I haven't seen him since the summer after 6th grade, more than 8 years now
        I know that feeling too. Even though we left my dad as he was an alcoholic and physically abusive.
But you still, for years and years to come, you think about how it could have been. Meanwhile I often say I am over it but that's not really true, as some scars tend to stay forever.

But I hope you are now well and lead a happy life. You and everybody else deserves it.
    On the bright side, you could have had a present but abusive dad! I'd rather have had no father, personally.
    There’s a lot of hurt in that lmao.

I have a friend that has three dogs in our world and he made them sit and never takes them anywhere and it makes me really sad
    To be fair I did the same thing with my dogs because I built each of them their own rooms and don't ever want them getting hurt.
        Glorious minecraft AI.
    I wish you could leave your pets on wandering around without teleporting to you.
        Can't you put them on leads?
            Not like that, I want the dog to wander around all of my base instead of being confined to this one corner.
                That's unfortunate. You should be able to craft a longer lead from two shorter leads.
                Doggy Talents mods lets you do stuff like that plus a lot more, if you're on Java Edition
    I do that. If I get a dog, I don’t want it following me to the mine or something and either dying by a creeper or jumping in lava. I always come back home though. I got really sad one day though when I tried to push my dog to the side of my bed in pocket edition and he fazed through the wall and started suffocating in the wall. I couldn’t break him out because I tried breaking the wooden wall with my fist and it hit the dog, but he was sitting, so no real knockback to get him out. He died in the wall and I made a grave for him. Complete with tombstone, sign on tombstone with his name, and a double chest in the ground buried with some bones.

        I had a pet parrot named Squeaky who was very cute but very stupid and he flew in front of my axe one day. I buried his feather in a grave with torches and flowers by my farm.
        I don't mean like he didn't bring him mining. I mean we have had this world for months and they are in the same spot.

    The trick is you got sitting dogs and walking dogs. You always leave 2 dogs sitting. You feed them both meat, and when they make a puppy, you take one of them and leave the puppy.
I actually cried a bit, I get very attached to my doggos and I can’t play Hardcore because of it.
    i have a rule in my hardcore, no pets at all, so yea
        The smartest person I have seen
            Yeah, it's big brain time.
        Big brain
        what about farm animals like cows, rabbits and chickens? they will starve if you die
            they wouldnt starve cause they have grass to eat and who considers rabbits farm animals?
                only sheep eat grass. i consider rabbits farm animals because they don't follow you and always escape you
    I stopped really caring about the health of my dogs after learning how to breed them, and breeding several dozen.
Oh god, that’s the weirdest feeling in my chest I’ve ever had. Contradictory emotions and shit
    Nostalgia, makes everyone to a young teen to a grown adult sad
That ending had me like :( :o :’’(
 I will wait for you

    THAT'S RIGHT I'VE HEARD THE STORY
I’ve always been on PE. When they made an update a few years ago I lost everything. My houses, my pets, everything I had worked hard for for years. Thank you for this, I miss you doggo.
Somehow this kind of makes me think of Spinel from the Steven Universe movie.
    Here in the garden, let’s play a game, I’ll show you how it’s done. Here in the garden, stand very still, this’ll be so much fun. And then she smiles the smiles, that’s what I’m after the smile in her eyes, the sound of her laughter, happy to listen, happy to stay, happily watching her drift away. 

The dog is living the life of Spinel that’s why you think of her.
Here in the garden, let's play a game, I'll show you how it's done
    Here in the garden, stand very still, this’ll be so much fun.

And then she smiles, that’s what I’m after the smile in her eyes, the sound of her laughter. Happy to listen, happy to play, happily watching her drift away.
Fine ! I'll log back !
    hardcore mode?
        No, just a death 3000 blocks away from spawn
            o
                ^yes
This is enough to make a grown man cry
    And that’s okay. You go right ahead, tear.
    I legit said 'oh my fucking god' out loud.
I was waiting for a happy ending! ):
Did the dog just fucking die
    No, he said fuck it, tossed off his name tag, and moved to Skyrim.
        Oh I thought he just straight up died
            No he said fuck it and moved to Skyrim
                I see
    This made me laugh so hard
***Happy to listen***  
***Happy to play***  
***Happily watching*** ***them*** ***drift away***
    What song
        Drift away :)
        [Steven Universe, Drift Away](https://youtu.be/Vs4yZ6Gs2q4)
    What is this song?
Petition to FORCE Mojang to allow you to respawn near your dog in Hardcore, you won't be able to do anything, just release your dog, taking of his name tag and leash, letting it be free.
    Yeah, the only think you should be able to do after you die in hardcore, can't do anything else but that.
Happily waiting...
NO STOP PLEASE

Good video, depressing but I love it. :)
Not what I expected but what I needed
Fuck I feel sad now.
Come on man, why you gonna break my heart like that
So I know that you spent a lot of time on this, but quite sincerely

#FUCK YOU

Dude, please never do this again. It's executed well, but come on, I'm low-key crying right now because of you.
This makes me even more sad when I think of all the dogs left behind from deaths in hardcore mode.
You managed to make Minecraft sad

Oh man
This hurts my feels

Noooo why the dogo!!
See u on hot
owners who died in hardcore*
We could use a mod that does this. “Aging Minecraft”
I got locked out of my original Minecraft account because I couldn’t migrate it to a Mojang account, I contacted Mojang support but they weren’t helpful. I ended up spending 27 dollars to play Minecraft again with a new account and I went to my old world that I used to play on a lot and I had this big house with a couple of dogs and because I was on my new account and my old account was completely gone they would never be able to recognize me so this video really speaks to me.
    You can probably hack the NBT to change their owner.
Aaagh, him me right in the feelings
F for Grim
Thanks Satan
I died in my hardcore world and still had 3 cats locked inside my house:(
Amazing editing. Regardless did you really NEED to make me fucking sad?
i hate you for making this
Dude why. Now I have to go back to my old worlds and take my dogs for a walk
You’re evil for doing this
I didn't need the big sad today, but here we are.
I didn't come here to feel :(

NO THATS NOT OK
N O :<<

nOO
:(
I'm parking this next to that one futurama episode in my mental vault of "sad things i'm not watching again"
That dog lived a long fucking time without movement, food or water. Remarkable it lived that long.

The dog legit just sat there in rain, and winds he'd be freezing. Staving. Dehydrated. Malnourished.

But nope. Just sat there and wasted away. Loyal to a fault.
Thanks I hate it
Why would you do this to me
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO😭😭😭😭😭
Aw, ya made me feel bad about leaving my old world a few years ago. So I logged back in, killed them, and went back to my new world. No more sad dog!
Im hurt on every level by this
Kinda reminds me of the "Jurassic Bark" episode of Futurama when the dog sits waiting for fry for 12 years. One of the saddest scenes in animation.
#aight bro im boutta head back
That was honestly sad.
My dog, Xenon has died today. Me and my brother were fighting in a raid, and xenon killed 2 ravagers and around 5 pillagers/vindicators. Then he died while trying to kill a 3rd ravager, the ravager had one hit left too. I am in mourning.
This is sad
But nobody came....
I'm not crying, you're crying.
The nametag got me...
***enough to make a grown man cry***
*You are a man*  
*You will not cry*  
*cry only for babies*  
**\*Rewatching this vod**

Do you have this uploaded on YouTube, OP?
Reminds me of that futurama scene where fry’s dog waited for the rest of his life for him to come back
I just looked in every single chunk i rendered on my server to find all my dogs. I now have 14
Take your upvote and never play with my feelings like that ever again.
Why tf would you do that to me??
Why is this trending. Now I sad.
I dont know about you, but i cried...
I was expecting a Sarah McLachlan song.
This is cool and all, but seeing all the sad comments... you all realize this is a game right
    [removed]
Can someone put the song from the scene of Seymour waiting in Futurama over this? I like pain
"She'll be back." - Loyal Boy
Calm down there Satan
This is what happens when you die in hardcore mode...
When the owner returns.

\-Steve/ alex: What the hell happened here?

\-Dog: It's your fault, you left for almost a week.

\-Steve/ Alex: It was only two hours.

\-Dog: Well, it felt like almost a week to me.
r/futruama
I expected to cry abt my gf breaking up with me, not about this
THat ending caught me off guard
that shit hurted
that made me sad :(
Okay wow that was depressing as fuck.
Thanks just went to all my old worlds and killed to dogs so they won't be waiting
Id like to think he just said "screw this" then bit his nametag off, and ran into the wild to meet a girl and start a new family.
Now I’m thinking about that old save I forgot to port over to Xbox 1 from 360
My 3 dogs and horse in MC X360 waited for too long. I need to see them right now! Thanks, man.
Thats deep
I'm actually crying wtf
Bro...not cool
When I finish a world i always throw a huge single player party making dance floors working music , and finally after I do all that with my dogs and cats and parrots . I put them to rest .. I know they’re only virtual but I still well up with tears when I have to
This is what happens in hardcore worlds
Me after saying to my mate: "ok, thats it for today, for sure lets play again next day!"
Now I’m going to have to go back to all my old worlds thanks op
That is just heartbreaking.
Mah heart
Mah soul
This is what happens in hardcore mode. Don't get pets in hardcore mode.
Then the owner comes back: "Jesus christ I only went to get some food, I was only gone 5 minutes!"
I hate when I see these stolen on Instagram with no credit whatsoever. It's really irritating.
Im not crying, you're crying
This is the most f*#^ed up things I’ve ever seen.

Have an upvote.
Reminds me of the futurama episode where fry’s dog was stuck there after he got frozen... that shit made me tear up 😢

This is like when you die in hardcore mode
WHY AM I FUCKING CRYING!!!
Thats why I cant play Minecraft anymore. I always cry because of nostalgia.
all I could think of was Seymour from Futurama
Sadly the owner was in hard mode
SORRY MR. PUPPY I made my first world on my grandfathers laptop and now the laptop is in some closet in his basement. I’ll never see you again.
Haha silly the world ceases to exist when I’m not around!
Decaying buildings while you're not playing would be pretty dope.

I usually delete my worlds when I know I'm done for a while though.
That shit hurted
I have big sad now
This video makes me sad because of all the love some dogs give to their owners just to get abused.
I’m not crying, you’re crying
My heArt
I’m gonna go give my Minecraft dogs some steak
IM NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING
I must be the goodest of Bois/girls and wait until he WILL come back.
is it normal to cry at this video?
My dog after i died in harcord
This video legitimately made me shed a tear.,. And I haven’t played Minecraft in years
***^(BRUH YOUVE GIVEN ME THE BIG SAD)*** D":
Why you gotta do that to dog Spinel. Dogel.
Haha wait where'd the dog go hiding?
this might sound bad but i almost cried
This is worse than breaking up with my minecraft girlfriend
He's walking on sunshine now.
This is so sad
Definitely needs the futurama song “I will wait for you” from the episode of the dog waiting for fry.
Spinel and Seymor be like
This what happens  to your dog if you die in hardcore mode
RIP doginson the third. He was the best dog. He would always sit in the house on the couch watching TV. He died, he died by going through my badly placed nether portal and falling into lava. He was on the world for 1 year and 2 months. I miss him every day, along with doginson the 1st and second. Doginson the 3rd was the longest living, they do say three times the charm.
It really made me feel depressed lol
It'd be really neat if abandoned structures degraded like this.
girls:you didnt cry watching titanic? youre a monster

me:
This filled me with so much sadness it made me tearbend!
When u die in hardcore mode
This is sad!😥
Is this what happens when a player dies in hardcore mode?
No wait Bob I'm sorry! I know it's been 3 years, but I lost the world!
nooooooOOOOOOOOOOOo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you are giving me futurama flashback!
How does he only have 7,000 karma
WHYYY
I think about this video every now and then, makes me sad
This makes me sad and I don't even have a dog(wolf).
I don’t care if this is 175 days old, I have two dogs and this made me nearly cry ffs
u/VredditDownloader
Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this.
    I met that guys girlfriend and she called him so we could ask him questions. He said that they were filming some stupid funny video and it was getting boring content wise so his friend just wacked him and that was his natural reaction
        this actually makes it funnier somehow
        Lol I always wondered what the context of that video was.
    Man with taste
now watch the futurama one
    I’m walking on sunshine !
[deleted]
    Ditto, came here to also make this protest.
        Yea that was a VERY sad scene. But at least we later find out that he did go back to his dog later on.
    Well that scene is based off of a true Japanese story called hatchiko it is the story of a shiba inu waiting for his dead owner to come back and ended up dying due to the fact it was sitting there with no food or water there is actually a statue of hatchiko look it up
Especially the part at the end where I thought everything was going to be fine :(
    But no. Feelings crushed.
        I’m never getting a dog in hardcore after seeing this
            I quit playing after my dog died in my last survival :(
                That happened to me and coming home everyday without my friend was very hard
                    My dog was named Henrick. I had him for 3 years since I didn’t really make other worlds. He died fighting off the hoard of zombies that killed me. After I respawned, all I saw was that horrible message that said something like “dog eaten by zombies”. I stopped playing survival for a while after that, and spent my days in creative making a funeral for him and a giant grave, with a lot of other doggo friends sitting around it to keep him company. I know he’s not a real dog but at the time I didn’t have any pets, so he felt real and being a kid and having a bigger imagination made him seem even more real. He was always so brave and will forever be my best boy.
                        Shit man I’m gonna be a legal adult in a few months and I still cry a little bit whenever my pets die in Minecraft
                            Happy cake day!
                                Thank you! Have some virtual cake! 😄🍰
                        I have a hardcore world that got corrupted and cut my base in half. The first thing i checked was my dig and cat. They're alive and well.
                        thats.... wow
                        :((
                        This comment made me cry twice. Don't listen to anyone who says otherwise, because it doesn't matter if he wasn't "real", you had a real companion for years and he died sacrificing himself for you. When you lose something or someone you love the medium doesn't matter. Rest easy, Henrick.
                        Rest in peace Henrick, you courageous virtual canine!
                        Dude that shit fucked me up holy crap like that’s just ugh... I’m sorry for your loss bud
                        RIP Henrick, the very bestest boy
                        I've never played Minecraft, but this hit me right in the feelers. Rest in peace, Henrick, you died a hero.
                        I relate to the pain of losing a dog but not on this level.  However losing my horse on red dead 2 almost made me cry.
                        My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
                At least he died instead of being left to wait... most likely forever.
                I’m not sure if I should up vote or down vote because I totally agree minded to his name was crypto :(
                    Omg is that after crypto the super dog? I haven't thought of that show in years.
                        Krypto*
                            Lol
                My horse I’ve had in my survival world since the beginning just died to a creeper attack and now I’m mad
                That’s a valid reason to quit
            I got one, but only because I found him in my empty sheep pen :( 
RIP my 20 sheep
            No. Having a dog is great. Just if you do, careful not to fall into a machine that deep freezes you for a thousand years and leave him there all alone.
            I have a dog and two cats in hardcore. 

Let's hope we won't die!
            DW it'll prob die before you
            Monster

            Aww thank you
        What I do during these is watch them through, then at the beginning pause it and everything is fine
    I think that bit might have been the dog's perspective in some form of afterlife
    Didn't know Jeb still added Termites

Im not crying! YOU'RE CRYING!
If it makes you feel better, time freezes in game when you quit, so really all the dogos are just in suspended animation.

After watching Adventure Time and finishing that show, was told I should watch  Steven Universe, after finding out more about this song, I think I'll get started on that...
                        You absolutely should, it's a great show and if you enjoyed adventure Time, I'm sure you'll like it. But the movie (where the song's from) has MAJOR spoilers, I really recommend not looking up anything more and first watching the five seasons of the series.
                            Or else you’ll be one of those people who gave the movie a bad review because they didn’t understand wtf is going on in the movie.
    And then she smiled, that's what I'm after...
I cant wait for my minecraft dog to come after me with a lightsaber scythe in 6000 years
    With black tear marks, the dog is grey and not cute anymore and the color is upside down and red eyes.
        What is he part of the forshaken is wow?
My exact thoughts, damn what a scene.
    Glad I reeled in some SU fans lol
        There's DOZENS OF US!!
    What a movie! I was annoyed at the character right until then, then suddenly I had to rewatch it 3 times.
        what movie are you talking about?
            Steven universe: The movie. Great show and great movie, I suggest u watch some
                I’ll check it out, thanks!
                    The show is a coming of age story though and starts with the main character as an annoying 10 year old. Lots of people can't get through the first couple episodes.

If you're having trouble, maybe start with the movie (though this would spoil a LOT) or a plot-only episode guide. Steven's so much more paletteable when you know what he grows into.
Stop it stop it OP’s video made me sad enough ahhh
    Steven Universe the Movie made me so sad. Not just the plot, but also because it was the beginning and end of an era in that show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AMp-JyC_68
u/cyprusdasquid what’s this quote from?
    Steven universe: The movie. Great show and great movie, I suggest u watch some
        Thanks!
            Just a heads up, the first half of season 1 is rough (season 1 is 26 10 minute episodes) but sadly not skippable due to how much world building happens in the episodes.  If you can power through them  you'll be treated to an amazing show.
    Here. (Spoilers for the movie though if you haven’t watch it yet.) https://youtu.be/ACOdhT82cc8
-
And heres the movie, need internet to watch: https://kimcartoon.to/Cartoon/Steven-Universe-The-Movie/Full?id=93183
        stevenuniver.se would be a less risky choice
Is Steven Universe any good? When I saw it first came out I thought it looked pretty stupid so I just dropped it
    It has come a looooong way since then, trust me
    Yeah it’s come a long way and it’s fire now, if you wanna start try to avoid anything about the movie because that will spoil literally everything.
    First half of the first season is pretty rough.  By about episode 20-25 it gets more bearable, and gets an actual story, character progression, etc.

It really picks up a lot by the end of season 1. Definitely worth pushing through the slow/abnoxious start.
    I had to grit through a few episodes before I started liking it as it felt too childish at the beginning, but honestly, it was worth it, so many characters, so much character development and the storyline is amazing, and then the movie that just got released, brilliant I cant stop listening to all the songs and have rewatched the movie multiple times already. 

So just grit through the first episodes and it gets better and better. It doesn't have 5 seasons and a movie for nothing ;D
Spinel 😭😭

    You’re a beautiful man
    Thanks man
    Thank you man I wouldnt be able to sleep tonight without this
    I hate to be the bringer of more depression, but,

That isn’t the same seed.
Why'd OP have to go and make the Minecraft version of the episode about Fry's dog.
    I was actually crying by the end of that episode of futurama. 

Aw shit. Here we go again
        I was slowly watching through all the episodes of Futurama as a kid on Netflix when I first found the show (this was probably about 9 years ago).

My dog, who was 17 years old (I was 13, so we’d had her my whole life) had reached the point where we decided it was time to put her down. No real quality of life for her anymore. Vet came over and did the deed at home. Suffice it to say, I was heartbroken. 

Go upstairs to my room to watch Futurama, thinking it’ll cheer me up and get my mind off of everything. This was literally mere hours after my dog had died. Cue Fry’s dog episode. 

Had to take a break from the show for probably a week, fucked me up so hard.
            I just read this and now I'm crying
            Jesus Christ dude, thats rough.
            Fucking damn i started this episode and my friend was watching it with me and idk exactly how the episode went but he saw the dog and went “man wouldn’t it suck if this episode took a sad turn” and me and him chuckled and then it took a sad turn and we were crying
            Jesus, that ep fucks me up and I've never really had to go through it. <time travel hug>
            Reminds me of when my dad passed away. A week or two after I decided to rewatch Scrubs. First fucking episode, the ending scene where the man had passed away in his hospital bed. It looked exactly like how my dad had passed away in his hospital bed. The man even looked a little like my dad. Had to take a break from that show for a good month, and I still can't watch that first episode of Scrubs for this reason.
        Yeah, me too. Don't worry about it.
            I was expecting the music when I unmuted the audio
                “So this is the power of Ultra Instinct?”
        What do you think fry? Wanna go round again?
        Talk about it man
        So say we all.
        Same
    I cried while watching that episode. Why did you remind me?
    THIS JUST MAKES IT WORSE DUDE NOW IM EVEN MORE SAD
    Which is also the true story of Hachiko, who has that nice statue
    Bruh that futurama episode i was thinking the same thing 😭
    If it takes forever,
I will wait for you.
For a thousand summers,
I will wait for you.
He could have shown someone coming back home tho
    The worst part was when the house came back together I thought for sure the owner was going to come back then no he’s dead and that was just the afterlife, how dare you play me like that OP!
        Oh no, dog afterlife is just waiting for your owner to come back for all eternity?
Me too
Sildur’s Vibrant Shaders. i had to use the lite version, since i dont really have a good computer
    [deleted]
        Thanks man, have fun with the shaders!
    I like those but they make all sources of light pink so I stopped using them. I’m probably just using an old version
        You can edit the light colors. You probably had red in RGB too high.
I didn't get my permission slip signed for this feels trip
    With the Friz, NO WAY
Damn, I know this is a joke (or not) but it kind of made me really sad because my dad actually left when I was in middle school and this post is how I felt growing up without him.
    Aw dude, I hope you are better now
        I am doing a lot better! I really really loved him a lot and I eventually learned to let him go and let him be happy.
            The way you said it in the original post it sounded like he just left spontaneously one day while you were at school. But if he broke up with your Mom I kind of understand more lol
                He did spontaneously leave. Well, my mom saw it coming but she tried to shield us from what was going on behind the scenes so when he did leave, we were like, oh fuck okay. The next ten years, we only got to see him a few days out of every year, because he was so busy with his new wife. Rip.
                    You sound pretty mature about the whole situation. My parents got divorced, remarried and divorced again. I was bitter until I took them off the "parent pedestal" and realized they were just human. And stupid.
    My dad left too when I was 4. Few years ago I heard he was at mental hospital...
        My dad went to jail for a year. When he came out, he got told to never contact me again. That happened when I was 5. I got told about it when I was 25.
            Oh wow, I'm sorry! I see my dad 
1 or 2 times a year:)

Edit: My mom never told me where dad was, I heard this from my sister, she thought it was a good time for me to know
        I read your comment as:
> “My dad left too when I was 4. This was a few years ago.” 

I was very confused.

But in all seriousness, so sorry to hear that.
            Haha it's okay, I still get chance to see him:)
    I feel ya. My mom passed away when I was a sophomore in highschool. Didn't know what happened until the day after. Last thing I said to her, "you want some more pizza" instead y, "I love you". So now I say those words every chance I get. Not the pizza one, the "I love you" words.
        Fuck, that must have been so rough, I’m sorry. I try to say “I love you” to my mom at least once everyday.
            It was. Than 2012, cat who was my brother passed away in my hands at Dec 25th 12:02am in my arms. Talk about a rough Christmas present from Satan. Anyway, I moved on and wrote a song about my losses. I didn't forget, just moved on. 
Oops, making this more sad, my bad. Here, have a [happy song](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XxLkEDzIoOGpO6KOYG9dV6155GpXROK10RltniC1leo/edit?usp=drivesdk) I wish I could sing.
    Same here, but now I have kids of my own and they're getting all the attention they deserve. Hopefully you'll get a chance to be there for someone else. When you do, turn all those negative experiences into something good. You'll look back on those middle-school days differently.
    Hey man, me too. My parents weren't together after I was born, but I saw my dad every week. I haven't seen him since the summer after 6th grade, more than 8 years now
    I know that feeling too. Even though we left my dad as he was an alcoholic and physically abusive.
But you still, for years and years to come, you think about how it could have been. Meanwhile I often say I am over it but that's not really true, as some scars tend to stay forever.

But I hope you are now well and lead a happy life. You and everybody else deserves it.
On the bright side, you could have had a present but abusive dad! I'd rather have had no father, personally.
There’s a lot of hurt in that lmao.
Thats exactly what I was thinking
    Came here to say that.  
  
*If it takes forever, I will wait for you...*
        *For a thousand summers, I will wait for you*
            *'til you're back beside me*
Was about to say OP should have used that music.
Instant goosebumps
An alternate timeline Fry took care of Seymour for his whole life. 
Seymour was loved.
    thank god for lars
*...I will wait for you...*

*...for a thousand summers...*
I wasn't expecting to cry today
don't do this to me
They needed to use that song for this.
Jurassic Bark and Luck of the Fryish got me good
Happy loaf of flour day
Happy cake day
Happy cake day
To be fair I did the same thing with my dogs because I built each of them their own rooms and don't ever want them getting hurt.
    Glorious minecraft AI.
I wish you could leave your pets on wandering around without teleporting to you.
    Can't you put them on leads?
        Not like that, I want the dog to wander around all of my base instead of being confined to this one corner.
            That's unfortunate. You should be able to craft a longer lead from two shorter leads.
            Doggy Talents mods lets you do stuff like that plus a lot more, if you're on Java Edition
I do that. If I get a dog, I don’t want it following me to the mine or something and either dying by a creeper or jumping in lava. I always come back home though. I got really sad one day though when I tried to push my dog to the side of my bed in pocket edition and he fazed through the wall and started suffocating in the wall. I couldn’t break him out because I tried breaking the wooden wall with my fist and it hit the dog, but he was sitting, so no real knockback to get him out. He died in the wall and I made a grave for him. Complete with tombstone, sign on tombstone with his name, and a double chest in the ground buried with some bones.

    I had a pet parrot named Squeaky who was very cute but very stupid and he flew in front of my axe one day. I buried his feather in a grave with torches and flowers by my farm.
    I don't mean like he didn't bring him mining. I mean we have had this world for months and they are in the same spot.

The trick is you got sitting dogs and walking dogs. You always leave 2 dogs sitting. You feed them both meat, and when they make a puppy, you take one of them and leave the puppy.
i have a rule in my hardcore, no pets at all, so yea
    The smartest person I have seen
        Yeah, it's big brain time.
    Big brain
    what about farm animals like cows, rabbits and chickens? they will starve if you die
        they wouldnt starve cause they have grass to eat and who considers rabbits farm animals?
            only sheep eat grass. i consider rabbits farm animals because they don't follow you and always escape you
I stopped really caring about the health of my dogs after learning how to breed them, and breeding several dozen.
Nostalgia, makes everyone to a young teen to a grown adult sad
*lays head on sidewalk one last time*
Fry’s dog, Seymour, as well.
THAT'S RIGHT I'VE HEARD THE STORY
Here in the garden, let’s play a game, I’ll show you how it’s done. Here in the garden, stand very still, this’ll be so much fun. And then she smiles the smiles, that’s what I’m after the smile in her eyes, the sound of her laughter, happy to listen, happy to stay, happily watching her drift away. 

The dog is living the life of Spinel that’s why you think of her.
Here in the garden, stand very still, this’ll be so much fun.

And then she smiles, that’s what I’m after the smile in her eyes, the sound of her laughter. Happy to listen, happy to play, happily watching her drift away.
hardcore mode?
    No, just a death 3000 blocks away from spawn
        o
            ^yes
And that’s okay. You go right ahead, tear.
I legit said 'oh my fucking god' out loud.
No, he said fuck it, tossed off his name tag, and moved to Skyrim.
    Oh I thought he just straight up died
        No he said fuck it and moved to Skyrim
            I see
This made me laugh so hard
What song
    Drift away :)
    [Steven Universe, Drift Away](https://youtu.be/Vs4yZ6Gs2q4)
What is this song?
Yeah, the only think you should be able to do after you die in hardcore, can't do anything else but that.
*you’ll find something waiting*
    *right there where you left it*
Here in the garden
Let’s play a game
Go ahead.

You can probably hack the NBT to change their owner.
sadly no
    Is there a Behavior pack or something I could get?
[removed]
I met that guys girlfriend and she called him so we could ask him questions. He said that they were filming some stupid funny video and it was getting boring content wise so his friend just wacked him and that was his natural reaction
    this actually makes it funnier somehow
    Lol I always wondered what the context of that video was.
Man with taste
I’m walking on sunshine !
Ditto, came here to also make this protest.
    Yea that was a VERY sad scene. But at least we later find out that he did go back to his dog later on.
Well that scene is based off of a true Japanese story called hatchiko it is the story of a shiba inu waiting for his dead owner to come back and ended up dying due to the fact it was sitting there with no food or water there is actually a statue of hatchiko look it up
But no. Feelings crushed.
    I’m never getting a dog in hardcore after seeing this
        I quit playing after my dog died in my last survival :(
            That happened to me and coming home everyday without my friend was very hard
                My dog was named Henrick. I had him for 3 years since I didn’t really make other worlds. He died fighting off the hoard of zombies that killed me. After I respawned, all I saw was that horrible message that said something like “dog eaten by zombies”. I stopped playing survival for a while after that, and spent my days in creative making a funeral for him and a giant grave, with a lot of other doggo friends sitting around it to keep him company. I know he’s not a real dog but at the time I didn’t have any pets, so he felt real and being a kid and having a bigger imagination made him seem even more real. He was always so brave and will forever be my best boy.
                    Shit man I’m gonna be a legal adult in a few months and I still cry a little bit whenever my pets die in Minecraft
                        Happy cake day!
                            Thank you! Have some virtual cake! 😄🍰
                    I have a hardcore world that got corrupted and cut my base in half. The first thing i checked was my dig and cat. They're alive and well.
                    thats.... wow
                    :((
                    This comment made me cry twice. Don't listen to anyone who says otherwise, because it doesn't matter if he wasn't "real", you had a real companion for years and he died sacrificing himself for you. When you lose something or someone you love the medium doesn't matter. Rest easy, Henrick.
                    Rest in peace Henrick, you courageous virtual canine!
                    Dude that shit fucked me up holy crap like that’s just ugh... I’m sorry for your loss bud
                    RIP Henrick, the very bestest boy
                    I've never played Minecraft, but this hit me right in the feelers. Rest in peace, Henrick, you died a hero.
                    I relate to the pain of losing a dog but not on this level.  However losing my horse on red dead 2 almost made me cry.
                    My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
            At least he died instead of being left to wait... most likely forever.
            I’m not sure if I should up vote or down vote because I totally agree minded to his name was crypto :(
                Omg is that after crypto the super dog? I haven't thought of that show in years.
                    Krypto*
                        Lol
            My horse I’ve had in my survival world since the beginning just died to a creeper attack and now I’m mad
            That’s a valid reason to quit
        I got one, but only because I found him in my empty sheep pen :( 
RIP my 20 sheep
        No. Having a dog is great. Just if you do, careful not to fall into a machine that deep freezes you for a thousand years and leave him there all alone.
        I have a dog and two cats in hardcore. 

Let's hope we won't die!
        DW it'll prob die before you
        Monster
            do you want them to suffer after you're gone like this?

        Yaas. I needed that.
        Thank you
        Aww thank you
    What I do during these is watch them through, then at the beginning pause it and everything is fine
I think that bit might have been the dog's perspective in some form of afterlife
Didn't know Jeb still added Termites

                >Happily watching her driiiiiift away.

After watching Adventure Time and finishing that show, was told I should watch  Steven Universe, after finding out more about this song, I think I'll get started on that...
                    You absolutely should, it's a great show and if you enjoyed adventure Time, I'm sure you'll like it. But the movie (where the song's from) has MAJOR spoilers, I really recommend not looking up anything more and first watching the five seasons of the series.
                        Or else you’ll be one of those people who gave the movie a bad review because they didn’t understand wtf is going on in the movie.
And then she smiled, that's what I'm after...
With black tear marks, the dog is grey and not cute anymore and the color is upside down and red eyes.
    What is he part of the forshaken is wow?
Glad I reeled in some SU fans lol
    There's DOZENS OF US!!
What a movie! I was annoyed at the character right until then, then suddenly I had to rewatch it 3 times.
    what movie are you talking about?
        Steven universe: The movie. Great show and great movie, I suggest u watch some
            I’ll check it out, thanks!
                The show is a coming of age story though and starts with the main character as an annoying 10 year old. Lots of people can't get through the first couple episodes.

If you're having trouble, maybe start with the movie (though this would spoil a LOT) or a plot-only episode guide. Steven's so much more paletteable when you know what he grows into.
Steven Universe the Movie made me so sad. Not just the plot, but also because it was the beginning and end of an era in that show.
Steven universe: The movie. Great show and great movie, I suggest u watch some
    Thanks!
        Just a heads up, the first half of season 1 is rough (season 1 is 26 10 minute episodes) but sadly not skippable due to how much world building happens in the episodes.  If you can power through them  you'll be treated to an amazing show.
Here. (Spoilers for the movie though if you haven’t watch it yet.) https://youtu.be/ACOdhT82cc8
-
And heres the movie, need internet to watch: https://kimcartoon.to/Cartoon/Steven-Universe-The-Movie/Full?id=93183
    stevenuniver.se would be a less risky choice
It has come a looooong way since then, trust me
Yeah it’s come a long way and it’s fire now, if you wanna start try to avoid anything about the movie because that will spoil literally everything.
First half of the first season is pretty rough.  By about episode 20-25 it gets more bearable, and gets an actual story, character progression, etc.

It really picks up a lot by the end of season 1. Definitely worth pushing through the slow/abnoxious start.
I had to grit through a few episodes before I started liking it as it felt too childish at the beginning, but honestly, it was worth it, so many characters, so much character development and the storyline is amazing, and then the movie that just got released, brilliant I cant stop listening to all the songs and have rewatched the movie multiple times already. 

So just grit through the first episodes and it gets better and better. It doesn't have 5 seasons and a movie for nothing ;D
Thank you for this
    I can now rest easy
    God bless you
Thank you
This is the salvation we all need.
You are a good man. Thank you

I hate to be the bringer of more depression, but,

I was actually crying by the end of that episode of futurama. 

Aw shit. Here we go again
    I was slowly watching through all the episodes of Futurama as a kid on Netflix when I first found the show (this was probably about 9 years ago).

My dog, who was 17 years old (I was 13, so we’d had her my whole life) had reached the point where we decided it was time to put her down. No real quality of life for her anymore. Vet came over and did the deed at home. Suffice it to say, I was heartbroken.

Had to take a break from the show for probably a week, fucked me up so hard.
        I just read this and now I'm crying
        Jesus Christ dude, thats rough.
        Fucking damn i started this episode and my friend was watching it with me and idk exactly how the episode went but he saw the dog and went “man wouldn’t it suck if this episode took a sad turn” and me and him chuckled and then it took a sad turn and we were crying
        Jesus, that ep fucks me up and I've never really had to go through it. <time travel hug>
        Reminds me of when my dad passed away. A week or two after I decided to rewatch Scrubs. First fucking episode, the ending scene where the man had passed away in his hospital bed. It looked exactly like how my dad had passed away in his hospital bed. The man even looked a little like my dad.

    Yeah, me too. Don't worry about it.
        I was expecting the music when I unmuted the audio
            “So this is the power of Ultra Instinct?”
    What do you think fry? Wanna go round again?
    Talk about it man
    So say we all.
    Same
I cried while watching that episode. Why did you remind me?
THIS JUST MAKES IT WORSE DUDE NOW IM EVEN MORE SAD
Which is also the true story of Hachiko, who has that nice statue
Bruh that futurama episode i was thinking the same thing 😭
If it takes forever,
I will wait for you.
For a thousand summers,
I will wait for you.
The worst part was when the house came back together I thought for sure the owner was going to come back then no he’s dead and that was just the afterlife, how dare you play me like that OP!
    Oh no, dog afterlife is just waiting for your owner to come back for all eternity?

    Thanks man, have fun with the shaders!
I like those but they make all sources of light pink so I stopped using them. I’m probably just using an old version
    You can edit the light colors. You probably had red in RGB too high.

Aw dude, I hope you are better now
    I am doing a lot better! I really really loved him a lot and I eventually learned to let him go and let him be happy.
        The way you said it in the original post it sounded like he just left spontaneously one day while you were at school. But if he broke up with your Mom I kind of understand more lol

My dad left too when I was 4. Few years ago I heard he was at mental hospital...
    My dad went to jail for a year. When he came out, he got told to never contact me again. That happened when I was 5. I got told about it when I was 25.
        Oh wow, I'm sorry! I see my dad 
1 or 2 times a year:)

Edit: My mom never told me where dad was, I heard this from my sister, she thought it was a good time for me to know
    I read your comment as:

But in all seriousness, so sorry to hear that.
        Haha it's okay, I still get chance to see him:)
I feel ya. My mom passed away when I was a sophomore in highschool. Didn't know what happened until the day after. Last thing I said to her, "you want some more pizza" instead y, "I love you". So now I say those words every chance I get. Not the pizza one, the "I love you" words.
    Fuck, that must have been so rough, I’m sorry. I try to say “I love you” to my mom at least once everyday.
        It was. Than 2012, cat who was my brother passed away in my hands at Dec 25th 12:02am in my arms. Talk about a rough Christmas present from Satan. Anyway, I moved on and wrote a song about my losses. I didn't forget, just moved on. 
Oops, making this more sad, my bad. Here, have a [happy song](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XxLkEDzIoOGpO6KOYG9dV6155GpXROK10RltniC1leo/edit?usp=drivesdk) I wish I could sing.
Same here, but now I have kids of my own and they're getting all the attention they deserve. Hopefully you'll get a chance to be there for someone else. When you do, turn all those negative experiences into something good. You'll look back on those middle-school days differently.
Hey man, me too. My parents weren't together after I was born, but I saw my dad every week. I haven't seen him since the summer after 6th grade, more than 8 years now
I know that feeling too. Even though we left my dad as he was an alcoholic and physically abusive.
But you still, for years and years to come, you think about how it could have been. Meanwhile I often say I am over it but that's not really true, as some scars tend to stay forever.

But I hope you are now well and lead a happy life. You and everybody else deserves it.
Came here to say that.  
  
*If it takes forever, I will wait for you...*
    *For a thousand summers, I will wait for you*
        *'til you're back beside me*
thank god for lars
Glorious minecraft AI.
Can't you put them on leads?
    Not like that, I want the dog to wander around all of my base instead of being confined to this one corner.
        That's unfortunate. You should be able to craft a longer lead from two shorter leads.

    Oof
I had a pet parrot named Squeaky who was very cute but very stupid and he flew in front of my axe one day. I buried his feather in a grave with torches and flowers by my farm.
I don't mean like he didn't bring him mining. I mean we have had this world for months and they are in the same spot.
The smartest person I have seen
    Yeah, it's big brain time.
Big brain
what about farm animals like cows, rabbits and chickens? they will starve if you die
    they wouldnt starve cause they have grass to eat and who considers rabbits farm animals?
        only sheep eat grass. i consider rabbits farm animals because they don't follow you and always escape you
No, just a death 3000 blocks away from spawn
    o
        ^yes
Oh I thought he just straight up died
    No he said fuck it and moved to Skyrim
        I see
Drift away :)

*right there where you left it*
Is there a Behavior pack or something I could get?
this actually makes it funnier somehow
Lol I always wondered what the context of that video was.
Yea that was a VERY sad scene. But at least we later find out that he did go back to his dog later on.
I’m never getting a dog in hardcore after seeing this
    I quit playing after my dog died in my last survival :(
        That happened to me and coming home everyday without my friend was very hard
            My dog was named Henrick. I had him for 3 years since I didn’t really make other worlds. He died fighting off the hoard of zombies that killed me. After I respawned, all I saw was that horrible message that said something like “dog eaten by zombies”. I stopped playing survival for a while after that, and spent my days in creative making a funeral for him and a giant grave, with a lot of other doggo friends sitting around it to keep him company. I know he’s not a real dog but at the time I didn’t have any pets, so he felt real and being a kid and having a bigger imagination made him seem even more real. He was always so brave and will forever be my best boy.
                Shit man I’m gonna be a legal adult in a few months and I still cry a little bit whenever my pets die in Minecraft
                    Happy cake day!
                        Thank you! Have some virtual cake! 😄🍰
                I have a hardcore world that got corrupted and cut my base in half. The first thing i checked was my dig and cat. They're alive and well.
                thats.... wow
                :((
                This comment made me cry twice. Don't listen to anyone who says otherwise, because it doesn't matter if he wasn't "real", you had a real companion for years and he died sacrificing himself for you. When you lose something or someone you love the medium doesn't matter. Rest easy, Henrick.
                Rest in peace Henrick, you courageous virtual canine!
                Dude that shit fucked me up holy crap like that’s just ugh... I’m sorry for your loss bud
                RIP Henrick, the very bestest boy
                I've never played Minecraft, but this hit me right in the feelers. Rest in peace, Henrick, you died a hero.
                I relate to the pain of losing a dog but not on this level.  However losing my horse on red dead 2 almost made me cry.
                My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
        At least he died instead of being left to wait... most likely forever.
        I’m not sure if I should up vote or down vote because I totally agree minded to his name was crypto :(
            Omg is that after crypto the super dog? I haven't thought of that show in years.
                Krypto*
                    Lol
        My horse I’ve had in my survival world since the beginning just died to a creeper attack and now I’m mad
        That’s a valid reason to quit
    I got one, but only because I found him in my empty sheep pen :( 
RIP my 20 sheep
    No. Having a dog is great. Just if you do, careful not to fall into a machine that deep freezes you for a thousand years and leave him there all alone.
    I have a dog and two cats in hardcore. 

Let's hope we won't die!
    DW it'll prob die before you
    Monster
        do you want them to suffer after you're gone like this?

After watching Adventure Time and finishing that show, was told I should watch  Steven Universe, after finding out more about this song, I think I'll get started on that...
                You absolutely should, it's a great show and if you enjoyed adventure Time, I'm sure you'll like it. But the movie (where the song's from) has MAJOR spoilers, I really recommend not looking up anything more and first watching the five seasons of the series.
                    Or else you’ll be one of those people who gave the movie a bad review because they didn’t understand wtf is going on in the movie.
What is he part of the forshaken is wow?
There's DOZENS OF US!!
what movie are you talking about?
    Steven universe: The movie. Great show and great movie, I suggest u watch some
        I’ll check it out, thanks!
            The show is a coming of age story though and starts with the main character as an annoying 10 year old. Lots of people can't get through the first couple episodes.

If you're having trouble, maybe start with the movie (though this would spoil a LOT) or a plot-only episode guide. Steven's so much more paletteable when you know what he grows into.
Thanks!
    Just a heads up, the first half of season 1 is rough (season 1 is 26 10 minute episodes) but sadly not skippable due to how much world building happens in the episodes.  If you can power through them  you'll be treated to an amazing show.
stevenuniver.se would be a less risky choice
I can now rest easy
God bless you
I was slowly watching through all the episodes of Futurama as a kid on Netflix when I first found the show (this was probably about 9 years ago).

My dog, who was 17 years old (I was 13, so we’d had her my whole life) had reached the point where we decided it was time to put her down. No real quality of life for her anymore. Vet came over and did the deed at home. Suffice it to say, I was heartbroken. 

Go upstairs to my room to watch Futurama, thinking it’ll cheer me up and get my mind off of everything. This was literally mere hours after my dog had died. Cue Fry’s dog episode. 

Had to take a break from the show for probably a week, fucked me up so hard.
    I just read this and now I'm crying
    Jesus Christ dude, thats rough.
    Fucking damn i started this episode and my friend was watching it with me and idk exactly how the episode went but he saw the dog and went “man wouldn’t it suck if this episode took a sad turn” and me and him chuckled and then it took a sad turn and we were crying
    Jesus, that ep fucks me up and I've never really had to go through it. <time travel hug>
    Reminds me of when my dad passed away. A week or two after I decided to rewatch Scrubs. First fucking episode, the ending scene where the man had passed away in his hospital bed. It looked exactly like how my dad had passed away in his hospital bed. The man even looked a little like my dad. Had to take a break from that show for a good month, and I still can't watch that first episode of Scrubs for this reason.
Yeah, me too. Don't worry about it.
    I was expecting the music when I unmuted the audio
        “So this is the power of Ultra Instinct?”
What do you think fry? Wanna go round again?
Talk about it man
So say we all.
Same
Oh no, dog afterlife is just waiting for your owner to come back for all eternity?
Thanks man, have fun with the shaders!
You can edit the light colors. You probably had red in RGB too high.
I am doing a lot better! I really really loved him a lot and I eventually learned to let him go and let him be happy.
    The way you said it in the original post it sounded like he just left spontaneously one day while you were at school. But if he broke up with your Mom I kind of understand more lol
        He did spontaneously leave. Well, my mom saw it coming but she tried to shield us from what was going on behind the scenes so when he did leave, we were like, oh fuck okay. The next ten years, we only got to see him a few days out of every year, because he was so busy with his new wife. Rip.
            You sound pretty mature about the whole situation. My parents got divorced, remarried and divorced again. I was bitter until I took them off the "parent pedestal" and realized they were just human. And stupid.
My dad went to jail for a year. When he came out, he got told to never contact me again. That happened when I was 5. I got told about it when I was 25.
    Oh wow, I'm sorry! I see my dad 
1 or 2 times a year:)

Edit: My mom never told me where dad was, I heard this from my sister, she thought it was a good time for me to know
I read your comment as:
> “My dad left too when I was 4. This was a few years ago.” 

I was very confused.

But in all seriousness, so sorry to hear that.
    Haha it's okay, I still get chance to see him:)
Fuck, that must have been so rough, I’m sorry. I try to say “I love you” to my mom at least once everyday.

He did spontaneously leave. Well, my mom saw it coming but she tried to shield us from what was going on behind the scenes so when he did leave, we were like, oh fuck okay. The next ten years, we only got to see him a few days out of every year, because he was so busy with his new wife. Rip.
    You sound pretty mature about the whole situation. My parents got divorced, remarried and divorced again. I was bitter until I took them off the "parent pedestal" and realized they were just human. And stupid.
My dog was named Henrick. I had him for 3 years since I didn’t really make other worlds. He died fighting off the hoard of zombies that killed me. After I respawned, all I saw was that horrible message that said something like “dog eaten by zombies”. I stopped playing survival for a while after that, and spent my days in creative making a funeral for him and a giant grave, with a lot of other doggo friends sitting around it to keep him company. I know he’s not a real dog but at the time I didn’t have any pets, so he felt real and being a kid and having a bigger imagination made him seem even more real. He was always so brave and will forever be my best boy.
    Shit man I’m gonna be a legal adult in a few months and I still cry a little bit whenever my pets die in Minecraft
        Happy cake day!
            Thank you! Have some virtual cake! 😄🍰
    I have a hardcore world that got corrupted and cut my base in half. The first thing i checked was my dig and cat. They're alive and well.
    thats.... wow
    :((
    This comment made me cry twice. Don't listen to anyone who says otherwise, because it doesn't matter if he wasn't "real", you had a real companion for years and he died sacrificing himself for you. When you lose something or someone you love the medium doesn't matter. Rest easy, Henrick.
    Rest in peace Henrick, you courageous virtual canine!
    Dude that shit fucked me up holy crap like that’s just ugh... I’m sorry for your loss bud
    RIP Henrick, the very bestest boy
    I've never played Minecraft, but this hit me right in the feelers. Rest in peace, Henrick, you died a hero.
    I relate to the pain of losing a dog but not on this level.  However losing my horse on red dead 2 almost made me cry.
    My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
Omg is that after crypto the super dog? I haven't thought of that show in years.

Happily waiting... All on my own...
    under the endless sky...
        counting the seconds... 
standing alone...
            As thousands of years go by...
        Counting the seconds... 
Standing alone...
>Happily watching her driiiiiift away.

After watching Adventure Time and finishing that show, was told I should watch  Steven Universe, after finding out more about this song, I think I'll get started on that...
    You absolutely should, it's a great show and if you enjoyed adventure Time, I'm sure you'll like it. But the movie (where the song's from) has MAJOR spoilers, I really recommend not looking up anything more and first watching the five seasons of the series.
        Or else you’ll be one of those people who gave the movie a bad review because they didn’t understand wtf is going on in the movie.
The show is a coming of age story though and starts with the main character as an annoying 10 year old. Lots of people can't get through the first couple episodes.
