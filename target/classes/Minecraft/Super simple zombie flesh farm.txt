[[Super simple zombie flesh farm]]





Now if mojang could make zombie flesh useful
    [deleted]
        I always feel bad for feeding my dogs rotten flesh while I gorge on steak, so I feed them steak too. They're eating like kings because of my unusual amount of empathy towards them. 
            Sure would be nice if dogs had different stats like horses do. Then maybe feeding them well could give them better damage output or health.

[](/fish)
                Sure would be nice if dogs had basic breeding (size, health, aggressiveness), leashes, and [packs](http://www.cesarsway.com/sites/default/files/cesarsway-images/product2/backpack/images/backpack04.jpg). Potentially far more useful than horses. Imagine having a dog companion who follows you around caves, guarding your back while carrying a small inventory.
                    And more than one type of dog. There are so many different horses, why not the same for other animals?
                        Many texture packs have random skins for mobs, keeping things interesting.
                            That's just a reskin. The different horses have different stats altogether.
                    I wish I could be a baby player, and be a wolf jockey
                        Oh hi there muu!
                    They kind of already have leashes if you craft a lead and use it on a dog.
                        I'd have better luck tying it to my pinky finger with dental floss.
                    I'm kind of surprised no one has made a dog breeding mod, similar to forestry bees/trees.
                        There was a great dog-training mod a while back that allowed you to improve their resistance to fire/lava, more damage, jumping, etc... but it was painful to use.
                        Bees? When did we get bees?
                            http://forestry.sengir.net/wiki.new/doku.php
                            He's referring to the bees in the Forestry mod.
                            NOOO! NOT THE BEES!
                    Sure would be nice if dogs didn't die instantly all the time.
                        Maybe... dogs are made out of boats!   *gasp*
                            Most legit theory ever!
                    >Imagine having a dog companion who follows you around caves, guarding your back while carrying a small inventory.

And not dying to the first creeper. Maybe cats should be improved too, so they can protect you and the dogs from creepers.
                    Carrying a small inventory? Naaah... what would be REALLY usefull is if he would be able to find a way out of some cave when you get lost ;) .
Or even smell some ore veins!
                We need a dog overhaul with a breeding system co selectively breed certain stats so they slowly evolve from wolves into different breeds due to the stats they lean towards.
                    +Agility
+Speed
+Intelligence
+Luck

Oh fuck I made a cat
                        Love my cats, man, but do you ever mean -Intelligence.
                            Nah, they're smart, just assholes.

+Intelligence +Temperament
                    Similar to the thing that ruined Pokémon? 
                        IVs existed since Gen I, you just didn't know they were there.
                            But competitive still ruined it. 
                                Competitive existed since Gen I.
                                Then don't play competitively. It's an entirely optional aspect of the game, and if you feel that it ruins your enjoyment, you have a choice to avoid it.

If you don't avoid something that you don't enjoy you have only yourself to blame for not enjoying it.
                                How?
            [deleted]
                When I look at my herd of cows, all I see is books.
                    Texture pack idea!
                        The Walking Books
                            Oh gods, cows that moan like zombies instead of mooing.
            I think that flesh restores more healt for them actually. If I doesn't, it used too
            I wouldn't feel bad. Wolves actually have a harder time digesting cooked meat than raw meat. And the more rotten it is the more they seem to enjoy it. So.. Think of it that way. 
            Start thinking about it as dog food. Hell, it'd probably be pretty easy to retexture it to a can of doge chow.
        It makes pretty good food too if you have enough. THIS IS GENIUS.
        And cheep dog food makes cheep armies.
        What you get from defending yourself from zombies if more than enough to feed your dogs.
    Like AtTheSky said, you can trade rotten flesh with some villagers for emeralds it the latest snapshots.
        But... why do they want rotten flesh anyway?

CONSPIRACY TIME!!
            They have top men seeking a cure and tissue samples provide a harmless means of studying zombies.
                Who?
                    Top men.
                        Key members of parliament. Key. 
                            And you put them in a room... with a zombie?
                                It's for the greater good.

Don't question the methods
                                wouldn't really notice much of a difference TBH they would probably do better after the erm.... treatment
                            Funkadelic?
                        Who?
                            The toppest of men.
                                Top ra-men
                                    [We will tell you when we learn more.](http://www.minecraft101.net/reference/images/testificates.jpg)
                    Top. Men.
                        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUcUMpo88uw
                    The often forgotten joke setter upper. 
            Maybe it's a bounty. Zombies are the only natural predator of the Villager, so they'll pay somebody with arms to kill Zombies for them.
                This is how I look at it. "Bring me proof that you killed a bunch of zombies, and I will pay you." 
                Looking at Mojang's comments when trading was being introduced... this actually is the answer.
            After perfecting the creation of Iron Golems and Snow Golems, they are attempting to create Flesh Golems.
                Aren't we already flesh golems?
                    The twist is that Steve was made by the testificates to hunt down monsters more aggressively than the iron golems. They accidentally gave him too much free will and he wandered off to change the very world they live in. Now they've decided to collect the flesh from the zombies Steve kills, and make another one to take him down.
                        *Herobrine*...
                        Okay, this is now canon.
                        This kind of goes along well with the first episode of [DBL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSR5bPDNER0&feature=kp). The order in which creatures are introduced are Organisms (single and multi-cell), lizards, Mammalsaurs, Mammals and Testificate Villagers (as nomads), and last steves (working as labor for the Villagers).

Plus the steves all look the same for quite some time, even though the villagers look like individuals.
                    Theyre made of MEAT!
                        Meat?
                            I got this reference :D
                        One of my 2 favorite sci-fi short stories! Look at that...time to go read this one again!
                    Negative,I am a meat Popsicle.
                        Multipass!
                    That would explain why Steve looks different from the Testificates. Wait… maybe the Testificates are the flesh golems, and they are just the remnants of a fallen magical civilization, and Steve is the only survivor, trying to reclaim what was lost.
            Think of it as a bounty for killing zombies, which means you defended the village.
                This is probably the only sensible explanation.

[](/fish)
            Think of it like a quest from your favourite MMO game.

"Hey there Amuter, I have a task for you.

To prove worthy of our trust in you, I will have you go and kill 34 zombies and bring me their flesh to prove yourself capable. You won't leave empty-handed.

Reward: 1 emerald"
            They use the flesh to make zombies.
            Right, it's not like villagers never encounter zombies! Hell, they should have more rotten flesh lying around the house than I do!
    You can use it in villager trading
        "Hey villager, stand here. Yeah, right there! Okay, the zombies are coming to kill you now, I'll just kill them and sell their remains to you! Everybody's happy!
            if you put THAT villager into OP's zombie flesh farm, then it's a perfect setup!
    There's a mod where you can cook zombie flesh and get leather. If that were implemented in the game, that would be awesome.
        As nice as the extra leather would be, I have a moral restriction on *using the skin of dead humans to make books and clothing*.

[](/fish)
            I don't follow.... what's the issue again? 
                Several people have suggested being able to cook/smelt zombie flesh into leather. Aside from that being nowhere near how actual leather is made (and human skin being terrible for leathermaking), I personally would be abhorred at using dead Steve parts to make book bindings or leather armor (which would then be next to *my* skin) in the same way that I currently do not engage in the necro-cannibalism that is eating zombie flesh.

[](/fish) 
                    Books from human skin? Now there's a [top list](http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-books-wrapped-in-human-skin.php) for everything.
                    .. psh what a weirdo...
            Probably better than being a zombie.  The alternative is cows, who aren't already dead.  Also, what are you fertilising crops with, exactly?

                Bonemeal. At least that process is a lot closer to the whole "circle of life" process of carbon recycling than making a book out of what used to be a Librarian villager not 10 minutes prior.

It's not a solid argument, but it's a lot further off of uncanny valley than the rotten flesh thing, the way I see it.

[](/fish)
        Agreed, would be much, much more useful than just having it as food
        There's one where you dry it into jerky and can eat it that way
    Not sure if they updated this, but zombie flesh regains tons of hunger, and you can just drink milk afterwards to negate the poison effect.
        Sadly, even after drinking Milk, it has terrible saturation value - as much as Spider Eyes and just a bit more than Cookies IIRC. Still, if you've got a Villager and a Cow and don't want to make a farm, this is a viable option.
            fishing rod ftw

it's the single most overpowered item in the entire game.

64 uses and it gets you about 13 levels of experience, lots of food and almost *guaranteed* to get a better fishing rod in the process. Rinse, repeat.

Only problem, it takes time, which is why i hacked together an automating fisherman with an arduino and a servomotor.

almost forgot: you also get enchanted bows in quite good condition and enchanted books 
                I fished once a Luck Of The Sea Unbreaking rod.

Was gud day.
                    i have a double chest full with enchanted fishing rods that i've gotten from fishing.

in a hardcore game

after half an hour dicking around in the nether, i seem to have three wither skeleton skulls.

i have no idea how to approach killing the wither in hardcore mode. I read the wiki for tutorials, maybe i will try one of them in a non-hardcore, hard difficulty map for practice
                        Easiest way to do it is just to iron golem camp the wither. They will kill it pretty fast. Doing it legitimately though? Get some Notch Apples and lots of potions + Protection and Explosion Protection armor to absorb the damage.
                            don't think wither head attacks count as explosions, but i could be wrong, it's been a while since i last read the wiki
                Fished a flame enchanted bow. Life was never the same again.
                That's some level awesome impracticality there, well played.  You know computers can press their own keys in software, right?  :P
                    yeah, but it detects when it has to reel in by listening to the sound.
                > Only problem, it takes time, which is why i hacked together an automating fisherman with an arduino and a servomotor.

If you want a "more legit" way of doing it, [here's a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aezeY1TCj0M) for an automatic fish farm that even replaces your fishing rod once you're done fishing! 
                    is that the 1.7.5 or whatever? yeah, i don't think it works in 1.7.9 :)
                        It's in the snapshots, but it *should* work for 1.7.9. Haven't tested it though. Could you show me your circuitry?
                            ya, when i wake up
                            There is no real circuitry

stick the soundcard's output to one of arduino's analog in. insert a capacitor between soundcard and arduino, for dc decoupling purposes. i stuck a 220uF one, you probably can put something smaller, i just didn't care.

stick a servo to one of arduino's analog out.

write a program: during init measures the analog in for half a second and calculates the average, so it knows what's the input for 'silence'. Also during init, it should move the servo to 'neutral'. During the loop it measures the input and if it is more than say 30 larger or smaller than 'silence', it moves the servo to press the key, delays like 100ms, back to neutral, delay about half a second, moves the servo to press the key again delay 100ms, move the servo back to neutral.

place the servo somehow on your keyboard so that in neutral it doesn't press the key when in the neutral position, but it does press the key when in the 'down' position. you will figure servo positions and angles by experimenting.

mute all computer sounds, *except* minecraft. This is important, but not as difficult as it sounds. Just make sure you're not playing music or any program that makes audible notifications.

mute all sounds inside minecraft *except* 'player'. set that to max.

i think you can figure it out from there.

            Nothing makes you hungrier than cookies.
            When i'm low on food when caving i usually let my hunger diminish a lot, then eat zombie flesh until my hunger bar is full, then wait for the effect to wear off, which decreases the hunger with 2 thingies, and then eat 1 piece of normal food.
        Or you can simply not move until the poison wears off.
            According to the wiki, the hunger effect causes a set amount of satuation/food loss, regardless of whether you are walking or standing still.

The smart thing is to eat a lot of rotten flesh at once, since the effect does not stack.
    I still really want to be able to smelt rotten flesh into leather. It would be useful for when I don't have cows.
        Tell ya what. You go ahead and try cooking a piece of rotten human meat in your oven for a few hours. Know what you're gonna get?

A wad of liquefied human, a horrible stench, and the cops knocking on your door.
            Maybe I will, but ill never know until I try.
            > liquefied 

The last time I tried this the flesh had become black, dry and brittle. Maybe cooking rotten flesh should result in charcoal.
    I'm a fan of the idea that cooking it would make leather
        That might be OP.
            How so? Pretty much all you can make with it is leather armour, which is way crappier than iron (which you'll probably have by the first night or so, anyway).

Also, item frames (which are purely decorational) and books, pretty much only used for bookshelves, which would only be useful once you  have an enchanting table, and by that point you'd be beyond the over-poweredness of getting leather from zombies.

Besides, creepers drop gunpowder, which lets you make tnt and blow stuff up. All this would really be doing is giving you a little bit of protection.
    I was on a server that allowed you to convert 4 zombie flesh to a piece of leather. Made sense and useful for making bookshelves. 
    Mod for Z flesh+smelt=leather out there, I love having it. As an idea, there should be a mod where if you craft flesh(9) to a fleshy clump, then fleshy clumps to arms, legs, head (recipes similar to that of armor), place the parts like you would an iron golem, splash potion of healthregen on it, and get a zombie companion. Whom which you can give armor, weapons, and it'll up your mining by 20% through assistance.
        Easy there, Frankenstein. But really, that would be kinda cool.
    You can trade for emeralds!
    They make it slightly more useful in 1.8 (Villagers want it)
Also IDK why people don't use it as food when your hunger is very low. Also feed to your dogs for fun. I hope you use dogs.


Only problem with this farm is string despawns on multiplayer servers.
    You can trade it with villagers in next update.
    If there would be a mod which converts zombieflesh into normal food using some other ressources like water, coal, w/e.
Tune in next time for the dirt block farm
    You've never known the usefulness of dirt until you've terraformed.

I would love a fully-auto dirt farm.
        Cobble... though you still need to afk at the generator unless you mod.

Cobble under a single layer of dirt keeps the creeper blasts under control, and saves dirt.
            You don't need to AFK at a cobblestone farm.

                Give you shit for building with damage control in mind?

Creepers are NPC griefers. No one likes griefers. I'd use obsidian but its a pain to gather.
        1.7.3 beta technic pack is amazing for this. just quarry up a giant hole, transform everything down, and boom, hella dirt
            except he's talking about vanilla and the current version, not beta tekkit.
                Sorry for trying to add to the conversation
    There are starving families in the mesa that could feed themselves using just 5 dirt blocks a week. Think of the children.
    You should really be able to compost stuff to make dirt.
        ex nihilo does this.
            Yes, I know, I've played Agrarian Skies.

It's a great mod, but it's balanced for skyblock so the sifter is overpowered in regular survival. I think the only really good survival addition is the barrels/composting mechanic, and that should be added to Vanilla.
    Been playing some Agrarian Skies. I'll take that dirt, please.
    if there's a way I'd make one just for the hell of it.
    Sips approve this message.
This would be really nice and original if (a) I didn't already have chests full of the crap and (b) herding villagers wasn't such a clusterfuck. Seriously, does anybody have any good ways of getting those jerks into one area apart from running almost through them for hours on end?
    Was a great one posted earlier to this sub, let me find it. brb.

You better appreciate that, it took me forever
        can you breed villagers?
            They automatically breed to ensure there is a maintained ratio of villagers to village houses. If you expand their village, they should start breeding to produce more villagers. You can read more [here](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Village_mechanics#Breeding_and_Population_cap).
        Haha, nice guide, but what really caught my attention was all the kidnapping comments.

'You monster'
    I just built a staircase to where I wanted him to be and waited until I saw a zombie villager. Then I lured him to the spot, closed him in and cured him. Dangerous, but pretty simple.
        In many cases, curing is easier than trying to bait villagers any distance.
            just put a wooden door there and wait for night
                You still have to get them to come *your* way when the sun sets.
                    use the wooden door as lure. they go nuts for doors.
                        I can't recall the last time I actually made a *wooden* door.

Was probably about when the zombies started pounding on them.
                            Then burn it after or something. If there's a village, destroy every wood door but yours and watch them flock. Point is villagers love wood doors. 

Or stick to curing them. Up to you.
            Yeah it depends how far away you are
    [deleted]
        This is what I do normally.  Atm, however, I'm trying to lift them ~60 blocks in the air, so either I use a shitton of gold or I build a water elevator, and every water elevator I build seems to drown them all.
            Just make a staircase of dirt or something up and use normal rails. Then push their minecart-trapped selves up yourself. That's how I get my iron farmers in place.

Make sure that in the end you drop them into an inescapable pen. Don't think you can break the cart and wall them in fast enough. That will cause endless headaches and likely frustrated shoving of villagers to their daeths. Also  be aware that you may not get your cart back if you want to keep them there.
    I put a door on it. If theres no others around they'll go straight for it.
    Fences, block them off behind as you go. Flowing water works to some extent. Pistons are a waste of time.
    After finding a nice village, fencing it off and lighting it with torches all over, some zombies still managed to spawn inside the perimeter and wipe out all of the villagers except for one. I trapped his ass in a 1x1 space with dirt for walls and ceiling. One of the walls was cobble stairs because he was standing next to a door when I found him. Basically, don't bother trying to build some nice containment cell for them, just quickly build a basic enclosure with whatever blocks you have in your inventory.
        They spawned because of a [zombie siege,](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Zombie_siege) basically the light level won't matter; the only way to *really* defend them is by making the entire floor out of half slabs.
            That's interesting, I though zombie sieges still depended on light level for the zombies to spawn....
    Just use zombie villagers, they spawn pretty frequently and are easy to transport. You just put him in place and change him back to a villager.
Now this... this is a tutorial to be proud of. It's simple, one picture, and gets the point across without handholding. You should be honored.
    Thanks. 
It's more efficient without the torches!
    True! Though it still works really well.

Won't some of the flesh be destroyed by the cactus?
    Doesn't matter. It will be getting most.  Plus it's rotten flesh. One of the most useless items in the game.
        Bitch please, that shit has saved my life so many times it's not even funny. I've given up steak to eat exclusively rotten flesh.
This is actually kind of useful for keeping zombies away without having to light up everything with torch spam.
    Yeah, that's actually why I made it here. 
you know i just rrealized rotten flesh is useless...MOJANG USE IT IN BREWING OR SOMETHING
    you can trade it with villagers for emeralds
        really what kind of villager

            The village idiot.
                so me? but how do i trade with myself
            cleric, the pink one
                k
            priests
                oh so it's bob...well that's bad because bob died
    You can trade it for emeralds with villagers in the latest snapshots. 
        what type...please tell me it's not john he's afraid of me
            Preists i think.
                oh...but bob's dead
                    Curse you, common names. I know Bob as a silly zombie that drank a growth potion indoors. He became immune to the sun, sure. But his house was in shambles.
                        well at least he didn't get the wood from his house stolen by steve
    We shoud be able to make splash potions of hungriness with rotten flesh,or use a fermented spider eye to make saturation.
        > hungriness


        mojang listen to him/her now
        And what would be the point of this in single player? You have to think of single and multiplayer
            Reverse it with fermented spider eye for satiration potion to regen your hunger, also it could make villagers full so their willing to breed again, it could stop zombies from wanting to eat your brains, and stuff. Not sure how the hunger potion itself will be useful, though...
            What if you threw a splash potion of hunger at a zombie and they attacked other zombies instead of the player
You could also put this in a taiga biome, replace the villager with a sheep or skeleton, and make a very inefficient wolf farm if you made a 2 block pit
    Do wolves drop anything yet?

                Open trap door door should work, since mobs see them as full blocks.
        No, but to keep as pets
Poor bastard. Look what he lives for.
haha nice. I use a similar trap (I call it the bug zapper) with a villager underground near my base surrounded by cactus. It's a good way to keep those uber trackers away.
    Hah, I like it. Bug zapper. Clever. :)
Step 1: Get Villager up there
    I've explained this a few times elsewhere here. Have a look around.
[removed]
    I thought reinforcement zombies only spawned when the player damages them? Otherwise it would rain flaming zombies in the morning, which was a bug in the original snapshot?

**Edit:** Tested it in 1.7, and it does seem that zombies taking cactus damage *do* in fact call in reinforcements. So much so that with a setup like the one in this post, there will be enough extra zombies to keep the "bugzapper" running almost indefinitely throughout the night.

[](/fish)
Simply Brilliant.
These zombie are trying to feed their families! They need flesh of villagers and here they are committing to death to just feed **THEIR LOVE ONES!**
Are those hoppers?
    Yes.
    Yes.
    No, their cauldrons. Far more useful for collecting things. /s
[deleted]
    It's simple enough with minecarts, but I just lured a zombie villager and cured him up there.
As a frequent builder of iron farms, I can say first hand that anything to do with moving villagers is NOT simple.
Whats on the floor around the cactus?
    Hoppers to collect drops.
    Hoppers
        Hawpahs
How u get him up there 
    Lured a zombie villager and cured it there.
This could be extremely useful on my skyblock island :D thnx
I never really considered using spiderweb to prevent it from growing, but good idea. (Although I don't think I have to worry about the cactus growing since it will stop anyway)
This is pretty ingenious! Goes to show there is still amazingly simple designs in the game to be found.
Simple design? Yes. Simple process? To a degree. Useful? Honestly no, but a good idea to be fair.
[deleted]
    They only drop other stuff when killed by players.
        Bah, I forgot. Thanks.
You could just put a slab on that cactus instead
    Then the zombies wouldn't take damage from it.
THis is slightly inefficient seeing as how if the drops touch the cactus before the hoppers they are destroyed. Unless they changed it so the cacti don't destroy dropped items.
    Oh no! I'm wasting one of the most useless items in the game!!!
    Yeah, lots of people have pointed that out. It's the tradeoff of having such a simple design. The vast majority of drops still get picked up. And believe me, it's more than enough!
Noob question from a non-noob: What uses are there for rotten flesh, because as far as I know, there are none.
    From one non-noob to another, rotten flesh has two uses: Feeding dogs and in 1.8 you'll also be able to trade it with villagers for emeralds.
        Oh yeah, right, I forgot about those.
Mmm zombie flesh xD. I should add a villager to my zombie spawner
I couldn't think of anything else, so I thought a companion based use seemed neat.
Upvote for class, simple idea I've seen some places, but I like this version best for some reason.
[deleted]
    but not all of them would hit the cactus
        But, inefficiencies think of all the lost rotten flesh!
            meh, who cares about a lost rotten flesh or two here and there?
The problem is that it generates a ton of lag on servers
    I think this was a bug back from when zombie tracking was first updated. I made this on a server and I haven't noticed any lag. I pretty sure it's fixed.
    Wait, why the lag? The zombies shouldn't spawn unless you were in the radius anyway and the entities don't pile up since they keep dying. Seems like it would work fine to me.
        There used to be bug in the game. Zombie AI tracking thing caused tons of lag, especially if the villager was impossible to reach.
Nice contraption there. never thought of it.
And iron tools.
    I don't think they drop iron tools (or any other special drops) unless you kill them yourself.
        Oh.
    [deleted]
        and tools.
            Only if you kill them yourselves.
                OKAY! I GET IT! GEEZ!

    I always feel bad for feeding my dogs rotten flesh while I gorge on steak, so I feed them steak too. They're eating like kings because of my unusual amount of empathy towards them. 
        Sure would be nice if dogs had different stats like horses do. Then maybe feeding them well could give them better damage output or health.

[](/fish)
            Sure would be nice if dogs had basic breeding (size, health, aggressiveness), leashes, and [packs](http://www.cesarsway.com/sites/default/files/cesarsway-images/product2/backpack/images/backpack04.jpg). Potentially far more useful than horses. Imagine having a dog companion who follows you around caves, guarding your back while carrying a small inventory.
                And more than one type of dog. There are so many different horses, why not the same for other animals?
                    Many texture packs have random skins for mobs, keeping things interesting.
                        That's just a reskin. The different horses have different stats altogether.
                I wish I could be a baby player, and be a wolf jockey
                    Oh hi there muu!
                They kind of already have leashes if you craft a lead and use it on a dog.
                    I'd have better luck tying it to my pinky finger with dental floss.
                I'm kind of surprised no one has made a dog breeding mod, similar to forestry bees/trees.
                    There was a great dog-training mod a while back that allowed you to improve their resistance to fire/lava, more damage, jumping, etc... but it was painful to use.
                    Bees? When did we get bees?
                        http://forestry.sengir.net/wiki.new/doku.php
                        He's referring to the bees in the Forestry mod.
                        NOOO! NOT THE BEES!
                Sure would be nice if dogs didn't die instantly all the time.
                    Maybe... dogs are made out of boats!   *gasp*
                        Most legit theory ever!
                >Imagine having a dog companion who follows you around caves, guarding your back while carrying a small inventory.

And not dying to the first creeper. Maybe cats should be improved too, so they can protect you and the dogs from creepers.
                Carrying a small inventory? Naaah... what would be REALLY usefull is if he would be able to find a way out of some cave when you get lost ;) .
Or even smell some ore veins!
            We need a dog overhaul with a breeding system co selectively breed certain stats so they slowly evolve from wolves into different breeds due to the stats they lean towards.
                +Agility

Oh fuck I made a cat
                    Love my cats, man, but do you ever mean -Intelligence.
                        Nah, they're smart, just assholes.

+Intelligence +Temperament
                Similar to the thing that ruined Pokémon? 
                    IVs existed since Gen I, you just didn't know they were there.
                        But competitive still ruined it. 
                            Competitive existed since Gen I.
                            Then don't play competitively. It's an entirely optional aspect of the game, and if you feel that it ruins your enjoyment, you have a choice to avoid it.

If you don't avoid something that you don't enjoy you have only yourself to blame for not enjoying it.

                        Oh gods, cows that moan like zombies instead of mooing.
        I think that flesh restores more healt for them actually. If I doesn't, it used too
        I wouldn't feel bad. Wolves actually have a harder time digesting cooked meat than raw meat. And the more rotten it is the more they seem to enjoy it. So.. Think of it that way. 
        Start thinking about it as dog food. Hell, it'd probably be pretty easy to retexture it to a can of doge chow.
    It makes pretty good food too if you have enough. THIS IS GENIUS.
    And cheep dog food makes cheep armies.
    What you get from defending yourself from zombies if more than enough to feed your dogs.
Like AtTheSky said, you can trade rotten flesh with some villagers for emeralds it the latest snapshots.
    But... why do they want rotten flesh anyway?

CONSPIRACY TIME!!
        They have top men seeking a cure and tissue samples provide a harmless means of studying zombies.
            Who?
                Top men.
                    Key members of parliament. Key. 
                        And you put them in a room... with a zombie?
                            It's for the greater good.

Don't question the methods
                            wouldn't really notice much of a difference TBH they would probably do better after the erm.... treatment

                The often forgotten joke setter upper. 
        Maybe it's a bounty. Zombies are the only natural predator of the Villager, so they'll pay somebody with arms to kill Zombies for them.
            This is how I look at it. "Bring me proof that you killed a bunch of zombies, and I will pay you." 
            Looking at Mojang's comments when trading was being introduced... this actually is the answer.
        After perfecting the creation of Iron Golems and Snow Golems, they are attempting to create Flesh Golems.
            Aren't we already flesh golems?
                The twist is that Steve was made by the testificates to hunt down monsters more aggressively than the iron golems. They accidentally gave him too much free will and he wandered off to change the very world they live in. Now they've decided to collect the flesh from the zombies Steve kills, and make another one to take him down.
                    *Herobrine*...
                    Okay, this is now canon.
                    This kind of goes along well with the first episode of [DBL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSR5bPDNER0&feature=kp). The order in which creatures are introduced are Organisms (single and multi-cell), lizards, Mammalsaurs, Mammals and Testificate Villagers (as nomads), and last steves (working as labor for the Villagers).

Plus the steves all look the same for quite some time, even though the villagers look like individuals.
                Theyre made of MEAT!
                    Meat?
                        I got this reference :D
                    One of my 2 favorite sci-fi short stories! Look at that...time to go read this one again!
                Negative,I am a meat Popsicle.
                    Multipass!
                That would explain why Steve looks different from the Testificates. Wait… maybe the Testificates are the flesh golems, and they are just the remnants of a fallen magical civilization, and Steve is the only survivor, trying to reclaim what was lost.
        Think of it as a bounty for killing zombies, which means you defended the village.
            This is probably the only sensible explanation.

[](/fish)
        Think of it like a quest from your favourite MMO game.

"Hey there Amuter, I have a task for you.

To prove worthy of our trust in you, I will have you go and kill 34 zombies and bring me their flesh to prove yourself capable. You won't leave empty-handed.

Reward: 1 emerald"
        They use the flesh to make zombies.
        Right, it's not like villagers never encounter zombies! Hell, they should have more rotten flesh lying around the house than I do!
You can use it in villager trading
    "Hey villager, stand here. Yeah, right there! Okay, the zombies are coming to kill you now, I'll just kill them and sell their remains to you! Everybody's happy!
        if you put THAT villager into OP's zombie flesh farm, then it's a perfect setup!
There's a mod where you can cook zombie flesh and get leather. If that were implemented in the game, that would be awesome.
    As nice as the extra leather would be, I have a moral restriction on *using the skin of dead humans to make books and clothing*.

[](/fish)
        I don't follow.... what's the issue again? 
            Several people have suggested being able to cook/smelt zombie flesh into leather. Aside from that being nowhere near how actual leather is made (and human skin being terrible for leathermaking), I personally would be abhorred at using dead Steve parts to make book bindings or leather armor (which would then be next to *my* skin) in the same way that I currently do not engage in the necro-cannibalism that is eating zombie flesh.

[](/fish) 
                Books from human skin? Now there's a [top list](http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-books-wrapped-in-human-skin.php) for everything.
                .. psh what a weirdo...
        Probably better than being a zombie.  The alternative is cows, who aren't already dead.  Also, what are you fertilising crops with, exactly?

            Bonemeal. At least that process is a lot closer to the whole "circle of life" process of carbon recycling than making a book out of what used to be a Librarian villager not 10 minutes prior.

It's not a solid argument, but it's a lot further off of uncanny valley than the rotten flesh thing, the way I see it.

[](/fish)
    Agreed, would be much, much more useful than just having it as food
    There's one where you dry it into jerky and can eat it that way
Not sure if they updated this, but zombie flesh regains tons of hunger, and you can just drink milk afterwards to negate the poison effect.
    Sadly, even after drinking Milk, it has terrible saturation value - as much as Spider Eyes and just a bit more than Cookies IIRC. Still, if you've got a Villager and a Cow and don't want to make a farm, this is a viable option.
        fishing rod ftw

it's the single most overpowered item in the entire game.

64 uses and it gets you about 13 levels of experience, lots of food and almost *guaranteed* to get a better fishing rod in the process. Rinse, repeat.

Only problem, it takes time, which is why i hacked together an automating fisherman with an arduino and a servomotor.

almost forgot: you also get enchanted bows in quite good condition and enchanted books 
            I fished once a Luck Of The Sea Unbreaking rod.

Was gud day.
                i have a double chest full with enchanted fishing rods that i've gotten from fishing.

in a hardcore game

after half an hour dicking around in the nether, i seem to have three wither skeleton skulls.

i have no idea how to approach killing the wither in hardcore mode. I read the wiki for tutorials, maybe i will try one of them in a non-hardcore, hard difficulty map for practice
                    Easiest way to do it is just to iron golem camp the wither. They will kill it pretty fast. Doing it legitimately though? Get some Notch Apples and lots of potions + Protection and Explosion Protection armor to absorb the damage.
                        don't think wither head attacks count as explosions, but i could be wrong, it's been a while since i last read the wiki
            Fished a flame enchanted bow. Life was never the same again.
            That's some level awesome impracticality there, well played.  You know computers can press their own keys in software, right?  :P
                yeah, but it detects when it has to reel in by listening to the sound.
            > Only problem, it takes time, which is why i hacked together an automating fisherman with an arduino and a servomotor.

If you want a "more legit" way of doing it, [here's a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aezeY1TCj0M) for an automatic fish farm that even replaces your fishing rod once you're done fishing! 
                is that the 1.7.5 or whatever? yeah, i don't think it works in 1.7.9 :)
                    It's in the snapshots, but it *should* work for 1.7.9. Haven't tested it though. Could you show me your circuitry?
                        ya, when i wake up
                        There is no real circuitry

stick the soundcard's output to one of arduino's analog in. insert a capacitor between soundcard and arduino, for dc decoupling purposes. i stuck a 220uF one, you probably can put something smaller, i just didn't care.

stick a servo to one of arduino's analog out.

write a program: during init measures the analog in for half a second and calculates the average, so it knows what's the input for 'silence'. Also during init, it should move the servo to 'neutral'. During the loop it measures the input and if it is more than say 30 larger or smaller than 'silence', it moves the servo to press the key, delays like 100ms, back to neutral, delay about half a second, moves the servo to press the key again delay 100ms, move the servo back to neutral.

place the servo somehow on your keyboard so that in neutral it doesn't press the key when in the neutral position, but it does press the key when in the 'down' position. you will figure servo positions and angles by experimenting.

mute all computer sounds, *except* minecraft. This is important, but not as difficult as it sounds. Just make sure you're not playing music or any program that makes audible notifications.

mute all sounds inside minecraft *except* 'player'. set that to max.

i think you can figure it out from there.

        Nothing makes you hungrier than cookies.
        When i'm low on food when caving i usually let my hunger diminish a lot, then eat zombie flesh until my hunger bar is full, then wait for the effect to wear off, which decreases the hunger with 2 thingies, and then eat 1 piece of normal food.
    Or you can simply not move until the poison wears off.
        According to the wiki, the hunger effect causes a set amount of satuation/food loss, regardless of whether you are walking or standing still.

The smart thing is to eat a lot of rotten flesh at once, since the effect does not stack.
I still really want to be able to smelt rotten flesh into leather. It would be useful for when I don't have cows.
    Tell ya what. You go ahead and try cooking a piece of rotten human meat in your oven for a few hours. Know what you're gonna get?

A wad of liquefied human, a horrible stench, and the cops knocking on your door.
        Maybe I will, but ill never know until I try.
        > liquefied 

The last time I tried this the flesh had become black, dry and brittle. Maybe cooking rotten flesh should result in charcoal.
I'm a fan of the idea that cooking it would make leather
    That might be OP.
        How so? Pretty much all you can make with it is leather armour, which is way crappier than iron (which you'll probably have by the first night or so, anyway).

Also, item frames (which are purely decorational) and books, pretty much only used for bookshelves, which would only be useful once you  have an enchanting table, and by that point you'd be beyond the over-poweredness of getting leather from zombies.

Besides, creepers drop gunpowder, which lets you make tnt and blow stuff up. All this would really be doing is giving you a little bit of protection.
I was on a server that allowed you to convert 4 zombie flesh to a piece of leather. Made sense and useful for making bookshelves. 
Mod for Z flesh+smelt=leather out there, I love having it. As an idea, there should be a mod where if you craft flesh(9) to a fleshy clump, then fleshy clumps to arms, legs, head (recipes similar to that of armor), place the parts like you would an iron golem, splash potion of healthregen on it, and get a zombie companion. Whom which you can give armor, weapons, and it'll up your mining by 20% through assistance.
    Easy there, Frankenstein. But really, that would be kinda cool.
You can trade for emeralds!
They make it slightly more useful in 1.8 (Villagers want it)
Also IDK why people don't use it as food when your hunger is very low. Also feed to your dogs for fun. I hope you use dogs.


Only problem with this farm is string despawns on multiplayer servers.
You can trade it with villagers in next update.
If there would be a mod which converts zombieflesh into normal food using some other ressources like water, coal, w/e.
You've never known the usefulness of dirt until you've terraformed.

I would love a fully-auto dirt farm.
    Cobble... though you still need to afk at the generator unless you mod.

Cobble under a single layer of dirt keeps the creeper blasts under control, and saves dirt.
        You don't need to AFK at a cobblestone farm.

            Sorry for trying to add to the conversation
There are starving families in the mesa that could feed themselves using just 5 dirt blocks a week. Think of the children.
You should really be able to compost stuff to make dirt.
    ex nihilo does this.
        Yes, I know, I've played Agrarian Skies.

It's a great mod, but it's balanced for skyblock so the sifter is overpowered in regular survival. I think the only really good survival addition is the barrels/composting mechanic, and that should be added to Vanilla.
Been playing some Agrarian Skies. I'll take that dirt, please.
if there's a way I'd make one just for the hell of it.

    can you breed villagers?
        They automatically breed to ensure there is a maintained ratio of villagers to village houses. If you expand their village, they should start breeding to produce more villagers. You can read more [here](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Village_mechanics#Breeding_and_Population_cap).
    Haha, nice guide, but what really caught my attention was all the kidnapping comments.

'You monster'
I just built a staircase to where I wanted him to be and waited until I saw a zombie villager. Then I lured him to the spot, closed him in and cured him. Dangerous, but pretty simple.
    In many cases, curing is easier than trying to bait villagers any distance.
        just put a wooden door there and wait for night
            You still have to get them to come *your* way when the sun sets.
                use the wooden door as lure. they go nuts for doors.
                    I can't recall the last time I actually made a *wooden* door.

Was probably about when the zombies started pounding on them.
                        Then burn it after or something. If there's a village, destroy every wood door but yours and watch them flock. Point is villagers love wood doors. 

Or stick to curing them. Up to you.
        Yeah it depends how far away you are

    This is what I do normally.  Atm, however, I'm trying to lift them ~60 blocks in the air, so either I use a shitton of gold or I build a water elevator, and every water elevator I build seems to drown them all.
        Just make a staircase of dirt or something up and use normal rails. Then push their minecart-trapped selves up yourself. That's how I get my iron farmers in place.

Make sure that in the end you drop them into an inescapable pen. Don't think you can break the cart and wall them in fast enough. That will cause endless headaches and likely frustrated shoving of villagers to their daeths. Also  be aware that you may not get your cart back if you want to keep them there.
I put a door on it. If theres no others around they'll go straight for it.
Fences, block them off behind as you go. Flowing water works to some extent. Pistons are a waste of time.
After finding a nice village, fencing it off and lighting it with torches all over, some zombies still managed to spawn inside the perimeter and wipe out all of the villagers except for one. I trapped his ass in a 1x1 space with dirt for walls and ceiling. One of the walls was cobble stairs because he was standing next to a door when I found him. Basically, don't bother trying to build some nice containment cell for them, just quickly build a basic enclosure with whatever blocks you have in your inventory.
    They spawned because of a [zombie siege,](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Zombie_siege) basically the light level won't matter; the only way to *really* defend them is by making the entire floor out of half slabs.
        That's interesting, I though zombie sieges still depended on light level for the zombies to spawn....
Just use zombie villagers, they spawn pretty frequently and are easy to transport. You just put him in place and change him back to a villager.
Thanks. 
True! Though it still works really well.
YOU SHOULD PUT STRING ON IT!

Doesn't matter. It will be getting most.  Plus it's rotten flesh. One of the most useless items in the game.
    Bitch please, that shit has saved my life so many times it's not even funny. I've given up steak to eat exclusively rotten flesh.
Yeah, that's actually why I made it here. 
you can trade it with villagers for emeralds
    really what kind of villager

        The village idiot.
            so me? but how do i trade with myself
        cleric, the pink one
            k
        priests
            oh so it's bob...well that's bad because bob died
You can trade it for emeralds with villagers in the latest snapshots. 
    what type...please tell me it's not john he's afraid of me
        Preists i think.
            oh...but bob's dead
                Curse you, common names. I know Bob as a silly zombie that drank a growth potion indoors. He became immune to the sun, sure. But his house was in shambles.
                    well at least he didn't get the wood from his house stolen by steve
We shoud be able to make splash potions of hungriness with rotten flesh,or use a fermented spider eye to make saturation.
    > hungriness


    mojang listen to him/her now
    And what would be the point of this in single player? You have to think of single and multiplayer
        Reverse it with fermented spider eye for satiration potion to regen your hunger, also it could make villagers full so their willing to breed again, it could stop zombies from wanting to eat your brains, and stuff. Not sure how the hunger potion itself will be useful, though...
        What if you threw a splash potion of hunger at a zombie and they attacked other zombies instead of the player
Do wolves drop anything yet?

        I guess with clever use of pressure plates and fence gates/doors.

                Sure. If you wanna do it the boring way.
                Yeah okay Ryan
                    You don't understand. Edgar's the one in the hole
            Open trap door door should work, since mobs see them as full blocks.
    No, but to keep as pets
Hah, I like it. Bug zapper. Clever. :)
I've explained this a few times elsewhere here. Have a look around.
I thought reinforcement zombies only spawned when the player damages them? Otherwise it would rain flaming zombies in the morning, which was a bug in the original snapshot?

**Edit:** Tested it in 1.7, and it does seem that zombies taking cactus damage *do* in fact call in reinforcements. So much so that with a setup like the one in this post, there will be enough extra zombies to keep the "bugzapper" running almost indefinitely throughout the night.

[](/fish)
Yes.
Yes.
No, their cauldrons. Far more useful for collecting things. /s
It's simple enough with minecarts, but I just lured a zombie villager and cured him up there.
Hoppers to collect drops.
Hoppers
    Hawpahs
Lured a zombie villager and cured it there.
They only drop other stuff when killed by players.
    Bah, I forgot. Thanks.
Then the zombies wouldn't take damage from it.
Oh no! I'm wasting one of the most useless items in the game!!!
Yeah, lots of people have pointed that out. It's the tradeoff of having such a simple design. The vast majority of drops still get picked up. And believe me, it's more than enough!
From one non-noob to another, rotten flesh has two uses: Feeding dogs and in 1.8 you'll also be able to trade it with villagers for emeralds.
    Oh yeah, right, I forgot about those.
but not all of them would hit the cactus
    But, inefficiencies think of all the lost rotten flesh!
        meh, who cares about a lost rotten flesh or two here and there?
I think this was a bug back from when zombie tracking was first updated. I made this on a server and I haven't noticed any lag. I pretty sure it's fixed.
Wait, why the lag? The zombies shouldn't spawn unless you were in the radius anyway and the entities don't pile up since they keep dying. Seems like it would work fine to me.
    There used to be bug in the game. Zombie AI tracking thing caused tons of lag, especially if the villager was impossible to reach.
I don't think they drop iron tools (or any other special drops) unless you kill them yourself.
    Oh.
[deleted]
    and tools.
        Only if you kill them yourselves.
            OKAY! I GET IT! GEEZ!
I always feel bad for feeding my dogs rotten flesh while I gorge on steak, so I feed them steak too. They're eating like kings because of my unusual amount of empathy towards them. 
    Sure would be nice if dogs had different stats like horses do. Then maybe feeding them well could give them better damage output or health.

[](/fish)
        Sure would be nice if dogs had basic breeding (size, health, aggressiveness), leashes, and [packs](http://www.cesarsway.com/sites/default/files/cesarsway-images/product2/backpack/images/backpack04.jpg). Potentially far more useful than horses. Imagine having a dog companion who follows you around caves, guarding your back while carrying a small inventory.
            And more than one type of dog. There are so many different horses, why not the same for other animals?
                Many texture packs have random skins for mobs, keeping things interesting.
                    That's just a reskin. The different horses have different stats altogether.
            I wish I could be a baby player, and be a wolf jockey
                Oh hi there muu!
            They kind of already have leashes if you craft a lead and use it on a dog.
                I'd have better luck tying it to my pinky finger with dental floss.
            I'm kind of surprised no one has made a dog breeding mod, similar to forestry bees/trees.
                There was a great dog-training mod a while back that allowed you to improve their resistance to fire/lava, more damage, jumping, etc... but it was painful to use.
                Bees? When did we get bees?
                    http://forestry.sengir.net/wiki.new/doku.php
                    He's referring to the bees in the Forestry mod.
                    NOOO! NOT THE BEES!
            Sure would be nice if dogs didn't die instantly all the time.
                Maybe... dogs are made out of boats!   *gasp*
                    Most legit theory ever!
            >Imagine having a dog companion who follows you around caves, guarding your back while carrying a small inventory.

And not dying to the first creeper. Maybe cats should be improved too, so they can protect you and the dogs from creepers.
            Carrying a small inventory? Naaah... what would be REALLY usefull is if he would be able to find a way out of some cave when you get lost ;) .
Or even smell some ore veins!
        We need a dog overhaul with a breeding system co selectively breed certain stats so they slowly evolve from wolves into different breeds due to the stats they lean towards.
            +Agility
+Speed
+Intelligence
+Luck

Oh fuck I made a cat
                Love my cats, man, but do you ever mean -Intelligence.
                    Nah, they're smart, just assholes.

+Intelligence +Temperament
            Similar to the thing that ruined Pokémon? 
                IVs existed since Gen I, you just didn't know they were there.
                    But competitive still ruined it. 
                        Competitive existed since Gen I.
                        Then don't play competitively. It's an entirely optional aspect of the game, and if you feel that it ruins your enjoyment, you have a choice to avoid it.

If you don't avoid something that you don't enjoy you have only yourself to blame for not enjoying it.
                        How?

        When I look at my herd of cows, all I see is books.
            Texture pack idea!
                The Walking Books
                    Oh gods, cows that moan like zombies instead of mooing.
    I think that flesh restores more healt for them actually. If I doesn't, it used too
    I wouldn't feel bad. Wolves actually have a harder time digesting cooked meat than raw meat. And the more rotten it is the more they seem to enjoy it. So.. Think of it that way. 
    Start thinking about it as dog food. Hell, it'd probably be pretty easy to retexture it to a can of doge chow.
It makes pretty good food too if you have enough. THIS IS GENIUS.
And cheep dog food makes cheep armies.
What you get from defending yourself from zombies if more than enough to feed your dogs.
But... why do they want rotten flesh anyway?

CONSPIRACY TIME!!
    They have top men seeking a cure and tissue samples provide a harmless means of studying zombies.
        Who?
            Top men.
                Key members of parliament. Key. 
                    And you put them in a room... with a zombie?
                        It's for the greater good.

Don't question the methods
                        wouldn't really notice much of a difference TBH they would probably do better after the erm.... treatment

            Top. Men.
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUcUMpo88uw
            The often forgotten joke setter upper. 
    Maybe it's a bounty. Zombies are the only natural predator of the Villager, so they'll pay somebody with arms to kill Zombies for them.
        This is how I look at it. "Bring me proof that you killed a bunch of zombies, and I will pay you." 
        Looking at Mojang's comments when trading was being introduced... this actually is the answer.
    After perfecting the creation of Iron Golems and Snow Golems, they are attempting to create Flesh Golems.
        Aren't we already flesh golems?
            The twist is that Steve was made by the testificates to hunt down monsters more aggressively than the iron golems. They accidentally gave him too much free will and he wandered off to change the very world they live in. Now they've decided to collect the flesh from the zombies Steve kills, and make another one to take him down.
                *Herobrine*...
                Okay, this is now canon.
                This kind of goes along well with the first episode of [DBL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSR5bPDNER0&feature=kp). The order in which creatures are introduced are Organisms (single and multi-cell), lizards, Mammalsaurs, Mammals and Testificate Villagers (as nomads), and last steves (working as labor for the Villagers).

Plus the steves all look the same for quite some time, even though the villagers look like individuals.
            Theyre made of MEAT!
                Meat?
                    I got this reference :D
                One of my 2 favorite sci-fi short stories! Look at that...time to go read this one again!
            Negative,I am a meat Popsicle.
                Multipass!
            That would explain why Steve looks different from the Testificates. Wait… maybe the Testificates are the flesh golems, and they are just the remnants of a fallen magical civilization, and Steve is the only survivor, trying to reclaim what was lost.
    Think of it as a bounty for killing zombies, which means you defended the village.
        This is probably the only sensible explanation.

[](/fish)
    Think of it like a quest from your favourite MMO game.

"Hey there Amuter, I have a task for you.

To prove worthy of our trust in you, I will have you go and kill 34 zombies and bring me their flesh to prove yourself capable. You won't leave empty-handed.

Reward: 1 emerald"
    They use the flesh to make zombies.
    Right, it's not like villagers never encounter zombies! Hell, they should have more rotten flesh lying around the house than I do!
"Hey villager, stand here. Yeah, right there! Okay, the zombies are coming to kill you now, I'll just kill them and sell their remains to you! Everybody's happy!
    if you put THAT villager into OP's zombie flesh farm, then it's a perfect setup!
As nice as the extra leather would be, I have a moral restriction on *using the skin of dead humans to make books and clothing*.

[](/fish)
    I don't follow.... what's the issue again? 
        Several people have suggested being able to cook/smelt zombie flesh into leather. Aside from that being nowhere near how actual leather is made (and human skin being terrible for leathermaking), I personally would be abhorred at using dead Steve parts to make book bindings or leather armor (which would then be next to *my* skin) in the same way that I currently do not engage in the necro-cannibalism that is eating zombie flesh.

[](/fish) 
            Books from human skin? Now there's a [top list](http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-books-wrapped-in-human-skin.php) for everything.
            .. psh what a weirdo...
    Probably better than being a zombie.  The alternative is cows, who aren't already dead.  Also, what are you fertilising crops with, exactly?

        Bonemeal. At least that process is a lot closer to the whole "circle of life" process of carbon recycling than making a book out of what used to be a Librarian villager not 10 minutes prior.

It's not a solid argument, but it's a lot further off of uncanny valley than the rotten flesh thing, the way I see it.

[](/fish)
Agreed, would be much, much more useful than just having it as food
There's one where you dry it into jerky and can eat it that way
Sadly, even after drinking Milk, it has terrible saturation value - as much as Spider Eyes and just a bit more than Cookies IIRC. Still, if you've got a Villager and a Cow and don't want to make a farm, this is a viable option.
    fishing rod ftw

it's the single most overpowered item in the entire game.

64 uses and it gets you about 13 levels of experience, lots of food and almost *guaranteed* to get a better fishing rod in the process. Rinse, repeat.

Only problem, it takes time, which is why i hacked together an automating fisherman with an arduino and a servomotor.

almost forgot: you also get enchanted bows in quite good condition and enchanted books 
        I fished once a Luck Of The Sea Unbreaking rod.

Was gud day.
            i have a double chest full with enchanted fishing rods that i've gotten from fishing.

in a hardcore game

after half an hour dicking around in the nether, i seem to have three wither skeleton skulls.

i have no idea how to approach killing the wither in hardcore mode. I read the wiki for tutorials, maybe i will try one of them in a non-hardcore, hard difficulty map for practice
                Easiest way to do it is just to iron golem camp the wither. They will kill it pretty fast. Doing it legitimately though? Get some Notch Apples and lots of potions + Protection and Explosion Protection armor to absorb the damage.
                    don't think wither head attacks count as explosions, but i could be wrong, it's been a while since i last read the wiki
        Fished a flame enchanted bow. Life was never the same again.
        That's some level awesome impracticality there, well played.  You know computers can press their own keys in software, right?  :P
            yeah, but it detects when it has to reel in by listening to the sound.
        > Only problem, it takes time, which is why i hacked together an automating fisherman with an arduino and a servomotor.

If you want a "more legit" way of doing it, [here's a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aezeY1TCj0M) for an automatic fish farm that even replaces your fishing rod once you're done fishing! 
            is that the 1.7.5 or whatever? yeah, i don't think it works in 1.7.9 :)
                It's in the snapshots, but it *should* work for 1.7.9. Haven't tested it though. Could you show me your circuitry?
                    ya, when i wake up
                    There is no real circuitry

stick the soundcard's output to one of arduino's analog in. insert a capacitor between soundcard and arduino, for dc decoupling purposes. i stuck a 220uF one, you probably can put something smaller, i just didn't care.

stick a servo to one of arduino's analog out.

write a program: during init measures the analog in for half a second and calculates the average, so it knows what's the input for 'silence'. Also during init, it should move the servo to 'neutral'. During the loop it measures the input and if it is more than say 30 larger or smaller than 'silence', it moves the servo to press the key, delays like 100ms, back to neutral, delay about half a second, moves the servo to press the key again delay 100ms, move the servo back to neutral.

place the servo somehow on your keyboard so that in neutral it doesn't press the key when in the neutral position, but it does press the key when in the 'down' position. you will figure servo positions and angles by experimenting.

mute all computer sounds, *except* minecraft. This is important, but not as difficult as it sounds. Just make sure you're not playing music or any program that makes audible notifications.

mute all sounds inside minecraft *except* 'player'. set that to max.

i think you can figure it out from there.

    Nothing makes you hungrier than cookies.
    When i'm low on food when caving i usually let my hunger diminish a lot, then eat zombie flesh until my hunger bar is full, then wait for the effect to wear off, which decreases the hunger with 2 thingies, and then eat 1 piece of normal food.
Or you can simply not move until the poison wears off.
    According to the wiki, the hunger effect causes a set amount of satuation/food loss, regardless of whether you are walking or standing still.

The smart thing is to eat a lot of rotten flesh at once, since the effect does not stack.
Tell ya what. You go ahead and try cooking a piece of rotten human meat in your oven for a few hours. Know what you're gonna get?

A wad of liquefied human, a horrible stench, and the cops knocking on your door.
    Maybe I will, but ill never know until I try.
    > liquefied 

The last time I tried this the flesh had become black, dry and brittle. Maybe cooking rotten flesh should result in charcoal.
That might be OP.
    How so? Pretty much all you can make with it is leather armour, which is way crappier than iron (which you'll probably have by the first night or so, anyway).

Also, item frames (which are purely decorational) and books, pretty much only used for bookshelves, which would only be useful once you  have an enchanting table, and by that point you'd be beyond the over-poweredness of getting leather from zombies.

Besides, creepers drop gunpowder, which lets you make tnt and blow stuff up. All this would really be doing is giving you a little bit of protection.
Easy there, Frankenstein. But really, that would be kinda cool.
Cobble... though you still need to afk at the generator unless you mod.

Cobble under a single layer of dirt keeps the creeper blasts under control, and saves dirt.
    You don't need to AFK at a cobblestone farm.

        Give you shit for building with damage control in mind?

Creepers are NPC griefers. No one likes griefers. I'd use obsidian but its a pain to gather.
1.7.3 beta technic pack is amazing for this. just quarry up a giant hole, transform everything down, and boom, hella dirt
    except he's talking about vanilla and the current version, not beta tekkit.
        Sorry for trying to add to the conversation
ex nihilo does this.
    Yes, I know, I've played Agrarian Skies.

It's a great mod, but it's balanced for skyblock so the sifter is overpowered in regular survival. I think the only really good survival addition is the barrels/composting mechanic, and that should be added to Vanilla.

    They automatically breed to ensure there is a maintained ratio of villagers to village houses. If you expand their village, they should start breeding to produce more villagers. You can read more [here](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Village_mechanics#Breeding_and_Population_cap).

They spawned because of a [zombie siege,](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Zombie_siege) basically the light level won't matter; the only way to *really* defend them is by making the entire floor out of half slabs.
    That's interesting, I though zombie sieges still depended on light level for the zombies to spawn....

mojang listen to him/her now
And what would be the point of this in single player? You have to think of single and multiplayer
    Reverse it with fermented spider eye for satiration potion to regen your hunger, also it could make villagers full so their willing to breed again, it could stop zombies from wanting to eat your brains, and stuff. Not sure how the hunger potion itself will be useful, though...
    What if you threw a splash potion of hunger at a zombie and they attacked other zombies instead of the player

Bah, I forgot. Thanks.
Oh yeah, right, I forgot about those.
But, inefficiencies think of all the lost rotten flesh!
    meh, who cares about a lost rotten flesh or two here and there?
There used to be bug in the game. Zombie AI tracking thing caused tons of lag, especially if the villager was impossible to reach.
Oh.
and tools.
    Only if you kill them yourselves.
        OKAY! I GET IT! GEEZ!
Sure would be nice if dogs had different stats like horses do. Then maybe feeding them well could give them better damage output or health.

[](/fish)
    Sure would be nice if dogs had basic breeding (size, health, aggressiveness), leashes, and [packs](http://www.cesarsway.com/sites/default/files/cesarsway-images/product2/backpack/images/backpack04.jpg). Potentially far more useful than horses. Imagine having a dog companion who follows you around caves, guarding your back while carrying a small inventory.
        And more than one type of dog. There are so many different horses, why not the same for other animals?
            Many texture packs have random skins for mobs, keeping things interesting.
                That's just a reskin. The different horses have different stats altogether.
        I wish I could be a baby player, and be a wolf jockey
            Oh hi there muu!
        They kind of already have leashes if you craft a lead and use it on a dog.
            I'd have better luck tying it to my pinky finger with dental floss.
        I'm kind of surprised no one has made a dog breeding mod, similar to forestry bees/trees.
            There was a great dog-training mod a while back that allowed you to improve their resistance to fire/lava, more damage, jumping, etc... but it was painful to use.
            Bees? When did we get bees?
                http://forestry.sengir.net/wiki.new/doku.php
                He's referring to the bees in the Forestry mod.
                NOOO! NOT THE BEES!
        Sure would be nice if dogs didn't die instantly all the time.
            Maybe... dogs are made out of boats!   *gasp*
                Most legit theory ever!
        >Imagine having a dog companion who follows you around caves, guarding your back while carrying a small inventory.

And not dying to the first creeper. Maybe cats should be improved too, so they can protect you and the dogs from creepers.
        Carrying a small inventory? Naaah... what would be REALLY usefull is if he would be able to find a way out of some cave when you get lost ;) .
Or even smell some ore veins!
    We need a dog overhaul with a breeding system co selectively breed certain stats so they slowly evolve from wolves into different breeds due to the stats they lean towards.

        Similar to the thing that ruined Pokémon? 
            IVs existed since Gen I, you just didn't know they were there.

                    Competitive existed since Gen I.
                    Then don't play competitively. It's an entirely optional aspect of the game, and if you feel that it ruins your enjoyment, you have a choice to avoid it.

If you don't avoid something that you don't enjoy you have only yourself to blame for not enjoying it.

    When I look at my herd of cows, all I see is books.

                Oh gods, cows that moan like zombies instead of mooing.
I think that flesh restores more healt for them actually. If I doesn't, it used too
I wouldn't feel bad. Wolves actually have a harder time digesting cooked meat than raw meat. And the more rotten it is the more they seem to enjoy it. So.. Think of it that way. 
Start thinking about it as dog food. Hell, it'd probably be pretty easy to retexture it to a can of doge chow.
They have top men seeking a cure and tissue samples provide a harmless means of studying zombies.
    Who?
        Top men.
            Key members of parliament. Key. 
                And you put them in a room... with a zombie?
                    It's for the greater good.

Maybe it's a bounty. Zombies are the only natural predator of the Villager, so they'll pay somebody with arms to kill Zombies for them.
    This is how I look at it. "Bring me proof that you killed a bunch of zombies, and I will pay you." 
    Looking at Mojang's comments when trading was being introduced... this actually is the answer.
After perfecting the creation of Iron Golems and Snow Golems, they are attempting to create Flesh Golems.
    Aren't we already flesh golems?
        The twist is that Steve was made by the testificates to hunt down monsters more aggressively than the iron golems. They accidentally gave him too much free will and he wandered off to change the very world they live in. Now they've decided to collect the flesh from the zombies Steve kills, and make another one to take him down.
            *Herobrine*...
            Okay, this is now canon.
            This kind of goes along well with the first episode of [DBL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSR5bPDNER0&feature=kp). The order in which creatures are introduced are Organisms (single and multi-cell), lizards, Mammalsaurs, Mammals and Testificate Villagers (as nomads), and last steves (working as labor for the Villagers).

Plus the steves all look the same for quite some time, even though the villagers look like individuals.
        Theyre made of MEAT!
            Meat?
                I got this reference :D
            One of my 2 favorite sci-fi short stories! Look at that...time to go read this one again!
        Negative,I am a meat Popsicle.
            Multipass!
        That would explain why Steve looks different from the Testificates. Wait… maybe the Testificates are the flesh golems, and they are just the remnants of a fallen magical civilization, and Steve is the only survivor, trying to reclaim what was lost.
Think of it as a bounty for killing zombies, which means you defended the village.
    This is probably the only sensible explanation.

[](/fish)
Think of it like a quest from your favourite MMO game.

"Hey there Amuter, I have a task for you.

To prove worthy of our trust in you, I will have you go and kill 34 zombies and bring me their flesh to prove yourself capable. You won't leave empty-handed.

Reward: 1 emerald"
They use the flesh to make zombies.
Right, it's not like villagers never encounter zombies! Hell, they should have more rotten flesh lying around the house than I do!
if you put THAT villager into OP's zombie flesh farm, then it's a perfect setup!
I don't follow.... what's the issue again? 
    Several people have suggested being able to cook/smelt zombie flesh into leather. Aside from that being nowhere near how actual leather is made (and human skin being terrible for leathermaking), I personally would be abhorred at using dead Steve parts to make book bindings or leather armor (which would then be next to *my* skin) in the same way that I currently do not engage in the necro-cannibalism that is eating zombie flesh.

[](/fish) 
        Books from human skin? Now there's a [top list](http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-books-wrapped-in-human-skin.php) for everything.
        .. psh what a weirdo...
Probably better than being a zombie.  The alternative is cows, who aren't already dead.  Also, what are you fertilising crops with, exactly?

    Bonemeal. At least that process is a lot closer to the whole "circle of life" process of carbon recycling than making a book out of what used to be a Librarian villager not 10 minutes prior.

It's not a solid argument, but it's a lot further off of uncanny valley than the rotten flesh thing, the way I see it.

[](/fish)
fishing rod ftw

it's the single most overpowered item in the entire game.

64 uses and it gets you about 13 levels of experience, lots of food and almost *guaranteed* to get a better fishing rod in the process. Rinse, repeat.

Only problem, it takes time, which is why i hacked together an automating fisherman with an arduino and a servomotor.

almost forgot: you also get enchanted bows in quite good condition and enchanted books 
    I fished once a Luck Of The Sea Unbreaking rod.

Was gud day.
        i have a double chest full with enchanted fishing rods that i've gotten from fishing.

in a hardcore game

after half an hour dicking around in the nether, i seem to have three wither skeleton skulls.

i have no idea how to approach killing the wither in hardcore mode. I read the wiki for tutorials, maybe i will try one of them in a non-hardcore, hard difficulty map for practice
            Easiest way to do it is just to iron golem camp the wither. They will kill it pretty fast. Doing it legitimately though? Get some Notch Apples and lots of potions + Protection and Explosion Protection armor to absorb the damage.
                don't think wither head attacks count as explosions, but i could be wrong, it's been a while since i last read the wiki
    Fished a flame enchanted bow. Life was never the same again.
    That's some level awesome impracticality there, well played.  You know computers can press their own keys in software, right?  :P
        yeah, but it detects when it has to reel in by listening to the sound.
    > Only problem, it takes time, which is why i hacked together an automating fisherman with an arduino and a servomotor.

If you want a "more legit" way of doing it, [here's a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aezeY1TCj0M) for an automatic fish farm that even replaces your fishing rod once you're done fishing! 
        is that the 1.7.5 or whatever? yeah, i don't think it works in 1.7.9 :)
            It's in the snapshots, but it *should* work for 1.7.9. Haven't tested it though. Could you show me your circuitry?
                ya, when i wake up
                There is no real circuitry

stick the soundcard's output to one of arduino's analog in. insert a capacitor between soundcard and arduino, for dc decoupling purposes. i stuck a 220uF one, you probably can put something smaller, i just didn't care.

stick a servo to one of arduino's analog out.

write a program: during init measures the analog in for half a second and calculates the average, so it knows what's the input for 'silence'. Also during init, it should move the servo to 'neutral'. During the loop it measures the input and if it is more than say 30 larger or smaller than 'silence', it moves the servo to press the key, delays like 100ms, back to neutral, delay about half a second, moves the servo to press the key again delay 100ms, move the servo back to neutral.

place the servo somehow on your keyboard so that in neutral it doesn't press the key when in the neutral position, but it does press the key when in the 'down' position. you will figure servo positions and angles by experimenting.

mute all computer sounds, *except* minecraft. This is important, but not as difficult as it sounds. Just make sure you're not playing music or any program that makes audible notifications.

mute all sounds inside minecraft *except* 'player'. set that to max.

i think you can figure it out from there.

Nothing makes you hungrier than cookies.
When i'm low on food when caving i usually let my hunger diminish a lot, then eat zombie flesh until my hunger bar is full, then wait for the effect to wear off, which decreases the hunger with 2 thingies, and then eat 1 piece of normal food.
According to the wiki, the hunger effect causes a set amount of satuation/food loss, regardless of whether you are walking or standing still.

The smart thing is to eat a lot of rotten flesh at once, since the effect does not stack.
Maybe I will, but ill never know until I try.
> liquefied 

The last time I tried this the flesh had become black, dry and brittle. Maybe cooking rotten flesh should result in charcoal.
How so? Pretty much all you can make with it is leather armour, which is way crappier than iron (which you'll probably have by the first night or so, anyway).

Also, item frames (which are purely decorational) and books, pretty much only used for bookshelves, which would only be useful once you  have an enchanting table, and by that point you'd be beyond the over-poweredness of getting leather from zombies.

Besides, creepers drop gunpowder, which lets you make tnt and blow stuff up. All this would really be doing is giving you a little bit of protection.
You don't need to AFK at a cobblestone farm.

    Give you shit for building with damage control in mind?

Creepers are NPC griefers. No one likes griefers. I'd use obsidian but its a pain to gather.
except he's talking about vanilla and the current version, not beta tekkit.
    Sorry for trying to add to the conversation
Yes, I know, I've played Agrarian Skies.

It's a great mod, but it's balanced for skyblock so the sifter is overpowered in regular survival. I think the only really good survival addition is the barrels/composting mechanic, and that should be added to Vanilla.
They automatically breed to ensure there is a maintained ratio of villagers to village houses. If you expand their village, they should start breeding to produce more villagers. You can read more [here](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Village_mechanics#Breeding_and_Population_cap).
just put a wooden door there and wait for night
    You still have to get them to come *your* way when the sun sets.
        use the wooden door as lure. they go nuts for doors.
            I can't recall the last time I actually made a *wooden* door.

Was probably about when the zombies started pounding on them.
                Then burn it after or something. If there's a village, destroy every wood door but yours and watch them flock. Point is villagers love wood doors. 

Or stick to curing them. Up to you.
Yeah it depends how far away you are
Just make a staircase of dirt or something up and use normal rails. Then push their minecart-trapped selves up yourself. That's how I get my iron farmers in place.

Make sure that in the end you drop them into an inescapable pen. Don't think you can break the cart and wall them in fast enough. That will cause endless headaches and likely frustrated shoving of villagers to their daeths. Also  be aware that you may not get your cart back if you want to keep them there.

I fished once a Luck Of The Sea Unbreaking rod.

Was gud day.
    i have a double chest full with enchanted fishing rods that i've gotten from fishing.

in a hardcore game

after half an hour dicking around in the nether, i seem to have three wither skeleton skulls.

i have no idea how to approach killing the wither in hardcore mode. I read the wiki for tutorials, maybe i will try one of them in a non-hardcore, hard difficulty map for practice
        Easiest way to do it is just to iron golem camp the wither. They will kill it pretty fast. Doing it legitimately though? Get some Notch Apples and lots of potions + Protection and Explosion Protection armor to absorb the damage.
            don't think wither head attacks count as explosions, but i could be wrong, it's been a while since i last read the wiki
Fished a flame enchanted bow. Life was never the same again.
That's some level awesome impracticality there, well played.  You know computers can press their own keys in software, right?  :P
    yeah, but it detects when it has to reel in by listening to the sound.
> Only problem, it takes time, which is why i hacked together an automating fisherman with an arduino and a servomotor.

If you want a "more legit" way of doing it, [here's a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aezeY1TCj0M) for an automatic fish farm that even replaces your fishing rod once you're done fishing! 
    is that the 1.7.5 or whatever? yeah, i don't think it works in 1.7.9 :)
        It's in the snapshots, but it *should* work for 1.7.9. Haven't tested it though. Could you show me your circuitry?
            ya, when i wake up
            There is no real circuitry

stick the soundcard's output to one of arduino's analog in. insert a capacitor between soundcard and arduino, for dc decoupling purposes. i stuck a 220uF one, you probably can put something smaller, i just didn't care.

stick a servo to one of arduino's analog out.

write a program: during init measures the analog in for half a second and calculates the average, so it knows what's the input for 'silence'. Also during init, it should move the servo to 'neutral'. During the loop it measures the input and if it is more than say 30 larger or smaller than 'silence', it moves the servo to press the key, delays like 100ms, back to neutral, delay about half a second, moves the servo to press the key again delay 100ms, move the servo back to neutral.

place the servo somehow on your keyboard so that in neutral it doesn't press the key when in the neutral position, but it does press the key when in the 'down' position. you will figure servo positions and angles by experimenting.

mute all computer sounds, *except* minecraft. This is important, but not as difficult as it sounds. Just make sure you're not playing music or any program that makes audible notifications.

mute all sounds inside minecraft *except* 'player'. set that to max.

i think you can figure it out from there.

Give you shit for building with damage control in mind?

Creepers are NPC griefers. No one likes griefers. I'd use obsidian but its a pain to gather.
Sorry for trying to add to the conversation
You still have to get them to come *your* way when the sun sets.
    use the wooden door as lure. they go nuts for doors.
        I can't recall the last time I actually made a *wooden* door.

Was probably about when the zombies started pounding on them.
            Then burn it after or something. If there's a village, destroy every wood door but yours and watch them flock. Point is villagers love wood doors. 

Or stick to curing them. Up to you.

Oh, 'ya got me! >_<
so me? but how do i trade with myself
k
oh so it's bob...well that's bad because bob died
oh...but bob's dead
    Curse you, common names. I know Bob as a silly zombie that drank a growth potion indoors. He became immune to the sun, sure. But his house was in shambles.
        well at least he didn't get the wood from his house stolen by steve
[deleted]
    Sure. If you wanna do it the boring way.
    Yeah okay Ryan
        You don't understand. Edgar's the one in the hole
Open trap door door should work, since mobs see them as full blocks.
OKAY! I GET IT! GEEZ!
And more than one type of dog. There are so many different horses, why not the same for other animals?
    Many texture packs have random skins for mobs, keeping things interesting.
        That's just a reskin. The different horses have different stats altogether.
I wish I could be a baby player, and be a wolf jockey
    Oh hi there muu!
They kind of already have leashes if you craft a lead and use it on a dog.
    I'd have better luck tying it to my pinky finger with dental floss.
I'm kind of surprised no one has made a dog breeding mod, similar to forestry bees/trees.
    There was a great dog-training mod a while back that allowed you to improve their resistance to fire/lava, more damage, jumping, etc... but it was painful to use.
    Bees? When did we get bees?
        http://forestry.sengir.net/wiki.new/doku.php
        He's referring to the bees in the Forestry mod.
        NOOO! NOT THE BEES!
Sure would be nice if dogs didn't die instantly all the time.
    Maybe... dogs are made out of boats!   *gasp*
        Most legit theory ever!
>Imagine having a dog companion who follows you around caves, guarding your back while carrying a small inventory.

And not dying to the first creeper. Maybe cats should be improved too, so they can protect you and the dogs from creepers.
Carrying a small inventory? Naaah... what would be REALLY usefull is if he would be able to find a way out of some cave when you get lost ;) .
Or even smell some ore veins!
+Agility
+Speed
+Intelligence
+Luck

Oh fuck I made a cat
    Love my cats, man, but do you ever mean -Intelligence.
        Nah, they're smart, just assholes.

+Intelligence +Temperament
Similar to the thing that ruined Pokémon? 
    IVs existed since Gen I, you just didn't know they were there.
        But competitive still ruined it. 
            Competitive existed since Gen I.
            Then don't play competitively. It's an entirely optional aspect of the game, and if you feel that it ruins your enjoyment, you have a choice to avoid it.

If you don't avoid something that you don't enjoy you have only yourself to blame for not enjoying it.
            How?
Texture pack idea!
    The Walking Books
        Oh gods, cows that moan like zombies instead of mooing.
Top men.
    Key members of parliament. Key. 
        And you put them in a room... with a zombie?
            It's for the greater good.

Don't question the methods
            wouldn't really notice much of a difference TBH they would probably do better after the erm.... treatment

The often forgotten joke setter upper. 
The twist is that Steve was made by the testificates to hunt down monsters more aggressively than the iron golems. They accidentally gave him too much free will and he wandered off to change the very world they live in. Now they've decided to collect the flesh from the zombies Steve kills, and make another one to take him down.
    *Herobrine*...
    Okay, this is now canon.
    This kind of goes along well with the first episode of [DBL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSR5bPDNER0&feature=kp). The order in which creatures are introduced are Organisms (single and multi-cell), lizards, Mammalsaurs, Mammals and Testificate Villagers (as nomads), and last steves (working as labor for the Villagers).

Plus the steves all look the same for quite some time, even though the villagers look like individuals.
Theyre made of MEAT!
    Meat?
        I got this reference :D
    One of my 2 favorite sci-fi short stories! Look at that...time to go read this one again!
Negative,I am a meat Popsicle.
    Multipass!
That would explain why Steve looks different from the Testificates. Wait… maybe the Testificates are the flesh golems, and they are just the remnants of a fallen magical civilization, and Steve is the only survivor, trying to reclaim what was lost.
Books from human skin? Now there's a [top list](http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-books-wrapped-in-human-skin.php) for everything.
