                        Ayo
                LTN:
    Actually this is bedrock. So you need beds, but also some other stuff like:

Lava bucket

Projectile (bow and arrow should do it)

Blocks

Obsidian/crying obsidian 

(Edit, forgot it before oopsy): Malee weapon (anything, even a pickaxe can do if you know how to do so)

And of course - beds (3 of them to be exact)

(Sorry but as a speedrunner it was kinda bothering me lol)
        What would a lava bucket do?
            Push the dragon down so it won't fly away too fast, giving you time to explode the other 2 beds
                I guess that can be useful but I’ve been playing on bedrock for so long you don’t need anything other than a bow, some armour, and some blocks
                    You are right, that is all you need to defeat it (you can also do it without armour, but then if you look at the eyes of an enderman you are a bit screwed). However, what I was talking about is what you need to one cycle (in other ways, what you need for the fastest way to kill the dragon). With a bow you can defeat it in probably around like 3-10 minutes, but with one cycle it is more like a minute.
            what even is a malee weapon?
                A melee weapon is a weapon you use by punching the mob head on. Swords, pickaxes, shovels, axes, hoes, and tridents can all function as melee weapons. Bows and Crossbows are not.
                    I knew that a melee weapon is what you‘ve described, just wanted to know what a malee weapon is
                        I think it was just a misspelling
        I’ve never used beds before, can you explain to me why you should? (genuine question)
            The Minecraft developers decided (a long time ago) that it can be funny to make beds explode if you try to sleep in the nether/end. So they made it a thing, and made the explosion slightly stronger than tnt. So speedrunners utilised it to kill the dragon really fast by exploding beds in a certain way near the dragon head, making it take tons of damage.

Now because dragon mechanics are different between java and bedrock, there is a different setup, with the bedrock setup being slightly more complicated (as you can see from the resources I listed, compared to java which is obsidian, a few blocks and 4+ beds for the standard setup), but it still works and still is faster than any other way of killing the dragon...
                I see, I know about the beds exploding. I just thought you meant it was a necessity to use beds which is what confused me. Thank you for explaining
            Beds explode when you sleep in them in the End. If you place them at the right time you can do massive damage to the Dragon, 3 beds is enough to kill it if you time it right
        why use beds when you can one shot dragon
            What do you mean one shot the dragon?
            What is blud yappin bout
            Because it's bedrock so one shot doesn't exist

Plus the non tas version of one shot is slightly slower than one cycle, and a lot slower than zero cycle, so it won't be faster and it is harder.
        I think You can beat it in peaceful mode but yeah that MIGHT be necessary in hard
        We all just gonna skip passed “Malee weapon,” huh >_>
    Speedrunners also be like: what is armor
        XD
 happy cake day !
    Honestly it's not even difficult...

But i do recommend the classic way because it's more interesting than waiting for a perch and timing bed explosions
        agreed, i do it the classic way every single time, no questions asked. Its just a lot more fun that way!
    Bow and one arrow btw(oneshot strat)
    Me be like: 
BANZAIIIIIIII (sprinting with a wooden sword)
    that was so funny
My brother you might have over prepped.

But better than the alternative.
    I'm so bad at this game I just make a double chest of stone swords and some carved pumpkins and go bop his nose.
        Honestly this feels like the best strat if you are not in hardcore mode. 
Put up a chest full of stone swords and building blocks. Go in, get the crystals, don't be afraid of dying. Especially considering how shit bedrock edition is (dying to nothing).
            Been playing bedrock for years, never died to "nothing".  👍
                Seen a lot of videos of people dying to bugs. It does happen rare, but for that reason I wouldn't overgear into the End dimension. Maybe nether as well.
                    In my years of playing it I've seen some bugs but never any that caused me to die or even hindered my gameplay at all, for that matter.
                        Long time since i played Bedrock, but back then the game glitched when you bridged to fast. It would not really place a block but you were able to crouch on to it and fell into the void
                            That's an Internet problem. Even playing on really slow devices I've never had that happen offline, only when playing multiplayer with friends or on servers and I had bad ping. I mean I guess it is technically still a bug, but it's multiplayer only and won't happen if you have good connection.
                                Oh that's true. It happened when playing on realms.
                        The only bugs I seem to remember are ones that helped me. Infinite XP, infinite fishing, infinite furnace fuel etc. All bedrock exclusive bugs iirc
                            My bedrock game crashed a while ago and when I went back in it duped my enchanted diamond armour
                        Yeah people just join the hate train for no reason, some never even played bedrock and cry
                            Yeah, what does it have to do with glitched deaths tho?
                Nether portal loading 

Lag while flying with elytra 

Etc
                    Omg I had one nether portal that caused suffocation/drowning damage while you loaded it. I would always throw something through to pre load it otherwise a slow connection could kill you.
                ive also played bedrock for years and I haven't died for "nothing" but i have died a lot to stupid bugs like the one where dragon brrath instantly kills you even with full armor and totem
                Same, I see videos of bedrock players dying to bugs all the time, but it hasn't happened to me even once
        If it's ridiculous but it works, then it's not ridiculous.
    He's forgetting about the water bucket
    showing up late
You gonna want a water bucket. I would say some more arrows.
    recommending a water bucket instead of potion of slowfalling to a clearly inexperienced player is peak reddit
        It's still useful though if you're willing to wait for the water to flow all the way down the tower. Also, if you're playing with friends, you can place water at the bottom of the tower. Also, water comes in handy if you get yourself into a tussle with endermen
            Yeah but instamine netherrack would be even better then waiting. Or get knocked off.
        It's still useful outside of waterbucket clutches though
            also good against enderman
            Back in my days we called them waterbucket MLGs
        The water bucket isn't for fall damage. It's for standing in if you accidentally aggro a bunch of endermen.  That's huge if you're a beginner. 

Your assumption is peak reddit.
        It's good to make a safe area from angry enderman and to make a stream to go down the towers.
        >clearly inexperienced player

In full netherite 

>instead of potion of slowfalling

Not useful against Endermen
        You can just place it on the side of the pillar and ride it down lol
I FUCKIN DID IT LETS GOOOO!!!!
    lesgo. now defeat the wither, and the warden, at once.
        Can’t we just have them fight each other lol
            Something something secret life
            I'm pretty sure the warden bodies the wither.
                I’ve never managed to kill either so you may be right
            Ooh creative mode time
        Now defeat me 😈
            ur not him
                I am him
                    nuh uh
                        Ok sorry
        Wither on bedrock 💀
    Bit of advice when you get the elytra: ALWAYS have land in sight when flying in the end. It is super easy to get disoriented in the end.
        My friend made that mistake once, he lost a hardcore world to it. It looked so scary from his pov, just the paper doll in the corner and coordinates to tell if he was plummeting to his death or not.
        I've gotten to the point now where I put an unbreaking enchant book and an anvil in an ender chest and enchant my elytra with it before I ever put it on. I've had my elytra break so many times while flying over the void.
    Congrats!!!
    Gg my dude. Enjoy looking arround for elytra and making exp farm
    MY MAN!!
    Nice..... now do it on pocket edition
        There's no way to garentee this wasn't mobile as pocket edition hasn't been a thing since june 8th 2017 (better together update) as you can Bluetooth controller with mobile making it easier
            All you need is the latest bluetooth version and an xbox one controller at minumum
                Yes neither of which are uncommon  and I do it with my ps4 controller just fine
            The one and only time I've killed the dragon was on pocket edition. 

I dont even bother with the dragon anymore though. I just go to the end with an inventory half full of leaves and bridge my way out to the islands. Usually doesn't take too long. And since endermen don't spawn on leaf blocks I don't have to worry about one going agro and knocking me off.
            It was on switch.
                Fair enough
            Pocket has a different menu
                Again Bluetooth controller tho I don't blame you for not believing me
    NIIIICE
    LETSGOO CONGRATS
    YEAH CONGRSTS
Get a Potion of Slow Falling, maybe two. Or a water bucket, if you're confident in your MLG water bucket clutches.
    Bring two buckets and then make an infinite source, running back and forth placing random water source blocks all around the island so no matter how high the dragon knocks you you can land in one. No solution for it knocking you 200 blocks horizontally away from the island though
        epearl
            Alright throw an enderpearl 200 blocks then
                lol if you're high up in the air that's easy
                    Duh but that just shows you’ve never been flung out 100+ blocks away from the island while keeping the y level either the same or lower. You ain’t surviving that with a pearl
                        That would never happen unless you are close to the edge
                            Which is something you have to do at least once, and twice if you’re a speed runner. You are on the edge when you spawn in, and you wait at the edge for the dragon to perch when you’re speed running. Lose focus for a couple seconds and that mf will send you flying into the abyss
    Slow falling is annoying when you are trying to jump and hit the dragon when she comes down. You'll end up with less hits.
        Milk
    You dont need that. Just use iron armor and tols and a water bucket
        tols
Looks good, try snow balls and gapples and pearls
You’re missing skill
I fought the dragon for the first time ever a few weeks ago and I severely over estimated how difficult it is. I had an inventory full of extra stuff like golden apples and potions and didn't even need a single one. I was able to get the majority of the towers with a bow and just used dirt to build up to the rest since with my shovel I can get back down in like a couple seconds. The actual fight only took a few minutes and didn't take like any damage the whole time
No you need a water bucket enchanted golden apples and totems of undying
    Reddit in a nutshell
Need golden apples in the mix. Regen is king. 

Netherite may be a little overkill, but if you’re ok losing it, should be fine.
Don’t forget about your totems, a water cup, and bottles to collect the dragons breath, also some healing potions wouldn’t be bad, just in case
Your over prepared, just hit the tickle spot and you can do it in a single arrow. Jokes aside bring like 2-3 stacks of empty glass bottles and use them on the dragon’s breath, you’ll get “bottles of dragon’s breath” which is used for making lingering potions and potion tipped arrows, plus the breath attack leaves a sort of cloud (use the bottles on the cloud) that sticks around a bit, but you spam the empty bottles and it clears it up almost instantly
Where's the water bucket and carved pumpkin? Both can be very important in certain situations.
You might be missing a bucket of water there pal
What armor trim are you using? It looks cool as shit
You should make a flying machine to end islands to get an elytra to help
    A flying machine on bedrock is so much worse  to build than on Java.... OP DO IT
Probably over prepared tbh, they need to buff the dragon and rework the entire fight… end update anyone? 👀
I think the bigger question is:

Is your skill enough to beat the ender dragon?
Iron tools, a bow and some emderpearls is enough to kill the ender dragon.
Slow falling potions and totems are also useful
Yea
Lol i beat the ender dragon in my world without destroying the crystals and killed it using a stone axe and a trident with loyalty
yes. you forgot something. you forgot to hug your mom and tell you that you love her today.
more than enough, however I would prefer having something to protect against endermen, either pumpkin on head or/and water buckets. I would also always carry enderpearls personally just in case, always useful. Also I'd rather have infinity on bow and be sure to never be out of arrows.
Since you're playing bedrock, no that is not enough
WATER BUCKET, ENDER PEARLS, YOU WILL NEED THOSE
Ok. I take a lot more precautions so I’d have done positions of slow falling, regen and like 10? Golden apples
Water bucket and pearls
i cant tell if your being sarcastic, if you aren't damn, no it its that's way little resources
I beat it on less, I think you’re good.
U only need iron armor and tools. Or just some beds
Bucket of water is essential every time you enter the End
No you need way more stuff
You can probably beat it but it will be easier with a bucket of water and some beds.
Depends on how much you’re willing to die (; I’ve done it with bare hands a few times
you forgot the water bucket
What kind of Ender Dragon are you facing? Mine die from a naked dude holding 10 beds.
ik I've already got 2 elytra and the end armour trim. I watch a Christmas movie and boom, 105 notifs.
You have enough to beat it, BUT GO FOR OVERKILL!!! STRENGTH, SPEED, JUMP BOOST(Optionally), TURTLE MASTER, SLOW FALLING IN CASE YOU GET KNOCKED INTO THE AIR, REGENERATION SO YOU HEAL QUICKER, INSTANT HEALTH IN CASE YOU GET LOW ON HP, PUT HARMING II POTIONS IN A CAULDRON AND RIGHT CLICK YOUR ARROWS ON IT FOR HARMING ARROWS TO GET MORE DAMAGE
No you need to beat the game first
Ur gonna need a water bucket and maybe a bed to respawn at
Get some beds
GET A BUNCH OF BEDS
Man i did it with nothing other than 2 stacks of dirt once and i suck at the game
    proof or gtfo
Yea but watch luke the notable before you do the wither
Me and the bois running iron gear just because we really want that ender man farm
Nah! You need some wheat seeds before you can defeat him.
Water bucket
no
 A Bucket of water or some ender pearls (can always grab them there) to help catch you if the dragon yeets you into the sky.  
If you care about achievements you should bring an empty bottle to the end to collect it’s breath for the “who needs a mint” advancement, although you can always redo this after you complete the respawning the dragon advancement
More than enough.
I usually bring a stack of logs and a crafting table with to explore the end islands with, makes making ahuker boxes easier if you have the wood!
Nah I think you need to bring a army of dogs
Back in my day, all we needed was a set of diamond armor, a bow with some arrows, some blocks, steak and a sword.
you need a water bucket to get back to the ground safe and faster
Bro, I fight the dragon with a water bucket, almost broken iron tools and and armor and some blocks and food😭 you are perfectly fine to go for it, just grab a water bucket first just to be safe😭
Water
Nope
Where’s your diamond hoe?!
Dide my friend and I killed it with wooden swords and axes and snowballs. You’re good
bro, all you need is iron gear.. this is so much overkill
It's overkill.
That is WAY more than enough
People beat the ender dragon before netherite was a thing.
For the end city u should make some slow fall potions I’ve actually straight up lost a hardcore world befor by falling
If you haven’t gone yet remember to bring water because the dragon can shoot you really high into the air and the endearment are afraid of it. Also you may have guessed but it’s always a good idea to set your spawn outside the portal beforehand in case you die.
Water bucket and some feather falling 4 on your boots
Water bucket
Need a stack of god apples 1st
lol you guys now he beat it like 6 hours ago
Nahh man.... at least 64 god apples and 10 totems
Pretty overkill but works
i think
You’re gonna need a water bucket for when the dragon launches you
Nah u missing regen potions and strength potions and slow falling potions.
I've done it in armoured with an infinite bow it just took ages, you should be fine
You are severely underequipped! Do not fight the Enderdragon he is too strong for you! /s
I'd keep a water bucket and a few potions like slow falling and health but aside from that you are ready. I'd also take empty bottles for dragons breath, never know if you'll need them and they aren't hard to get.
Damn, id say thats too much
Water buckets I bunch of them
All u really need is iron gear and bow with infinity/2 stacks of arrows
Confidence
You should craft a couple backup sets of netherite armor, and bring a netherite beacon for the free potion effects
Water bucket, and maybe a couple totems. Also some potions if you want to
Ya, thats more than fine
enter the end, go get elytra, then fight to make the dragon 1% easier
Killing the ender dragon for the first time with full netherite is wild lol I normally go in with full iron
    oh this ain't my first time. I just acting like I am for karma
Water bucket(s), more food
I just fight it in iron or diamond armor with un enchanted diamond tools lol
If anything, that's a bit overprepared. There's a few things you're forgetting though.

Maybe ditch the axe, shovel, and second pick (not really useful in the end), add a bit more arrows, and bring a water bucket. Glass bottles to collect Dragon's Breath are a good idea too, if only for the advancement. Also, if there's one enchantment you want, it's Feather Falling IV. Ender pearls could come in handy too to avoid taking full fall damage/clutch throw if you get knocked off the island.
Actually I think you need a few beacons so you can get health regen and feather falling. Also I’d grab a pair of elytra so you can fly.
This is most certainly enough. If you want to fight it in a fair way, even an iron set of armour with a lot of arrows would be enough if you were good at the game. But with the set you have now it'll be hard to die. Assuming Bedrock doesn't make the dragon a lot more different than Java like it does with the Wither.
You’re forgetting at LEAST 2 GOD APPLES and at LEAST 5 Totems. Also don’t forget 64 bottles to collect Dragons Breath so you can make the Wither Storm summoning item!
    I’m serious about Dragons breath it can be used to make lingering arrows and lingering potions. So I recommend just getting like 9 bottles and filling those so it doesn’t over clutter your inventory when you fill them, but at least you’ll have a few
bro some ppl go in with a few beds and nothing else, you’re overprepared
Not enough beds
Dont use beds, if you die you will revive in original spawn
Nah
I beat the sender Dragon with 10 stacks of crafting tables, 1 water bucket, and an iron axe. Get on my level
Nah you have to get the enderite armor, dragon egg sword and dragon breath bow first
No. You need an army of wolves.
No, youre gonna need an elytra and a few stacks of end crystals to blow them up with
Strength 2 beacon
OP
Bro 😂😂😂 I’ve used iron armor + power 3 bow + ench iron sword(sharp IV, fire aspect 2) to beat it. Your chilling
Set it up correctly, you can beat the dragon naked and punching it with your bare fists.
If you want cheese do the following 
Sharp 5 netherite sword
strength 2 pots
Turtle master pots
Fully enchanted netherite  God armour with featherfalling boots and thorns on all equipment 
Make sure you've got at least 3 gapples and 3-5beds
And lastly you need 1 friend to kill the dragon 20 times for you so you can build a dragon farm 
Then you've got no way to fail as you have only a skill level to blame
I do it with 4 beds and two crying obsidian
Bro could’ve gone with base iron and been chillin
Diamond trim I'm dying 💀💀💀💀💀💀
all you really need is a water bucket and a sword with some food and regeneration potions if you’re unconfident
A water bucket ya buffoon
Try bringing like 3-7 rockets if your also planning on getting the elytra you can fly home easily
no
I know you've done it already, but my advice would be to bring 1 or 2 pearls because void death sucks
Pack some potions just in case if you about to die
You overprepared A LOT, but u still forgot a water bucket
The Bedrock version might kill you anyway...
Yeah bro
You’ll probably want a water bucket and slow falling potions, just for extra security imo.
Get some beds then you are ready
feather falling?
A water bucket? Also end crystals are op once you finish destroying them all as you can do instant damage to the dragon by placing and breaking it, also maybe a touch more food
I killed the dragon first time with with a iron armor, diamond sword, bow and water bucket

All with basic enchantment

You're more than prepared
Netherite beacon for regeneration
That sounds good, but you probably need atleast 192 beds.
i dont think
No, you're gonna want 7 sets of enchanted diamond trimmed netherite armor and 3 netherite swords with sharpness IV, mending, and unbreaking IV
overkill but yeah
Get a water bucket
More god apples. I dont think youre gonna be ready til you have a full shulker of 64
You got much more than enough, go for it
Water bucket, more useful than you think
I’ve beat with an iron sword and leather armor, you got this
I really hope this is a joke post
    It's a bit of both. If it weren't for reddit I would have forgotten the water bucket. I just saw an op to farm karma
        lol u only need beds to kill dragon it's super easy. without beds just iron armor and a bow with like 32arrows is fine
Water bucket
Bro you can beat it in iron armor, you’re fine😅
    fall damage:
Not enough beds
Water bucket is very useful in my opinion
no bucket, no boat, nor any ither form of fall damage negation, not a full stack of garrots
Not having a water bucket, ender pearl or a slow falling potion in your hotbar isn't a good idea
Nah you forgot the golden apples, notch apples, 3 stacks of TNT, 2 stacks of obsidian and crystals and beds
You can beat it with iron armor, some arrows, and beds. Overprepped dude
water bucket!
Maybe pearls or a water bucket cuz you get sent flying when the dragon hits you
Yes and also water bucket
Well you already beat it but I wouldve suggested a carved pumpkin head, works great to keep the endermen off your ass until you can get high enough to hit the end crystals.
You're overpowered tbh
Get a water bucket. And some ender pearls if you can :)
Uhh yeah that’s definitely enough. More than enough, but you should probably obtain a water bucket for MLG.
Enchant your bow with Infinity and only take one arrow :)
You just need water and some way to do damage, we used to do it in iron armor
If you're planning on defeating it without dying I highly recommend you go in with just iron armor and kamikaze with beds. Put aside your god armor and just keep going in death after death until he goes down.
    He doesn't reset each time you die?
        Not in my experience on bedrock.
yea why not
I really regret going on with my god armor and everything because even though it's rng you can still get knocked into the void.
No
Water bucket just in case
Get water bucket, get enderpearls. if u cant get enderpearls then just the water should be fine
+ bucket of water? (Encase you look at an enderman)?
+ rockets for the journey back if going for elytra? 

Bad flex BTW.
Yeah just right when you spawn dig straight down works every time
Water bucket, maybe more food? 

Also if you're going to get an elytra, I'd say bring a few rockets. But up to you
Get some snowfall potions and or waterbucket.
What’s the axe, shovel, and pickaxes for? I wouldn’t risk losing those. Also I’d take some beds in case you want to go for that method.
If you're a good shot, I'd say you're probably good to go. Like some said, a water bucket is helpful. If you wanna collect dragon's breath, glass bottles for that.
I'm a terrible shot, so I always use an infinity bow. But it's preference really.
Also if you were worried, you could make some slow falling potions.
Where's your bucket of water ?
Nah man got another 30+ hours to go
WHERE WATER
You can technically beat the dragon bare handed so long as you have a way to get to it
You need to either ender pearls or a water bucket to have it complete
You would benefit greatly from replacing the shovel with a water bucket, and one stack of cobble with a few Ender pearls. 

Enderman can’t touch water. It damages them. If you accidentally make eye contact with a few at once, they’ll crowd you and you’ll be in a rough spot. The water bucket stops them immediately. 

The Ender pearls are in case you get flung off the map by the dragon. You can throw one and save yourself.
You can beat the dragon with iron armor beds and a bow with a few arrows so yeah that'll be fine
No. You need minimum 2 Elytras if you want a chance, otherwise it's near impossible
Honestly, if you have the patience and a friend to play with, you could save your materials and beat it with punches — just set up some beds near the end portal
I would suggest Potion of slow falling or E-Pearls to neglect fall damage.
Plenty
Absolutely not. In fact you’re completely screwed and also should be ashamed of yoursef
All you need a is a bed and determination
You can beat him with an un-enchanted bow,  bucket of water, 64 dirt blocks and iron armor if you’re decent at the game. 

Just beds if you’re good at the game.
Bring a water bucket and ender pearls. Also some beds if you want to speed things along, but if not I understand.
Slow falling potion and water Bucky and you’re set
I bring a carved pumpkin.
Pearls, and maybe a totem?
Someone tell this person that some iron armour, a bucket of water and an inventory filled with beds is more than enough 💀
    It’s possible they don’t want to exploit beds
No
I beat the ender dragon in diamond gear even tho i have netherite, don't risk it
Ur good bro
Cooked beef
WATER BUCKET
Where the water bucket???
Yeah If you’re strategic but if I was you I’d bring a water bucket
5 beds (6 to be safe), 3-6 obsidian, a stack of pearls and an axe to really be on the safe side
Jesus Christ the only thing you need is beds
Yes, java edition
Mmm add a few beds and u good XD
Too much for the speedrunners
My brother in Christ.
Yes
I’d suggest a carved pumpkin and a few totems of undying. Just to be safe
God yes!
I’d bring Totem of Undying and some potions
Id bring some pearls (or get them from endermen as soon as you enter the end) it a water bucket as a way of clutching f the dragon yeets u into the air - if you're not that good at clutching, bring slow falling potions
People here really want to make another r/MinecraftMemes trend
I think u r underprepared and need to take better stuff like a trident and crossbow along with a tank, a rpg and a F-18. Then u should be fine
fuck sake this isn’t r/Breath_of_the_Wild
It's not enough. You need a railgun cannon
Personnaly i fight the ender dragon after i got the elytra. It made the crystal destroying phase much easier
I always just go in there with iron and bread cuz I don’t wanna loose all my good stuff 😭
Get some ender pearls
No bruh thats only enough for a chicken, OFC IT FCKING IS
Bring a bed to sleep in immediately after the fight.

That way, when you finally exit the portal, it'll be daytime.
nah man you gotta unlock creative mode
Not even close /s
Beds are enough to beat the dragon
Omg! Are you sure you did not use creative??
Nope, still need slow falling potions.
Personally, I always take a slow falling potion so if I fall from a tower or the dragon throughs me in the air I don't take damage
Golden Apples
Water bucket , at least 2
No. Keep beds and tipped arrows of harming
Water bucket.
More arrows,
More food.
Then you really are set
A couple water buckets and a stone sword
If you haven't defeated it yet, I'd recommend bringing a water bucket and some Ender Pearls, though you can just get Ender Pearls in the end anyway
No three buckets of water? Rookie mistake.
get a second set of netherite armour with protection🤡
Couple of enderperls would be good
no water, no pearls, no gapples, no beds
No i dont think so u might die be careful
Golden apples for health recovering/regenerating ability OR instant healing potions.

Craved pumpkin to wear it as helmet to prevent the endermen from attacking you.  It is very useful for safe travel on the end islands after the ender dragon defeat.

A bucket of water.   You can use it to 'swim' down from a pillar or a defensive against endermen.   Water can hurt them.

Scaffoldings or ladders to reach the top of the pillars to demolish the iron cages in order to destroy the crystals.  Scaffoldings is fastest way and fast recovery.

Obsidian blocks for safe shelters from endermen yet cannot be destroyed by the ender dragon.

One or two more stacks of arrows if you're going to do ranging on the dragon without full bow enchantments.

Bring a few empty glass bottles for the ender dragon achievement (using it on its firebreath).

You do not need axe, shovel, and torches for the ender dragon battle.  Pickaxe to break the iron cages and mine out a safe spot inside the pillars.
back in our day, you could kill the dragon with diamond armour.

and as an unofficial speedrunner, you can kill the dragon with iron armour and beds.
***YES***
water.
you need ender pearls too and water buckets in case you're swarmed by endermen
If that doesn't do it, it's a skill issue
you need some totem
Totem
a few beds are enought to kill the dragon so this is more than enough  just take a water bucket
Where are your skills?
You definitely need that to beat Jean
waterbucket!!!! dont forget that shit. and pearls
Where are your beds? You’re going to want to reset your spawn just in case you die!!
Wait. Can you enchant shields in Bedrock Edition?
Anything is enough to beat the ender dragon. You might want a water bucket tough
Potion of slow falling
You overprepped. The dragon is nothing special after the first time
Yes
You can beat it with no armour and some beds the dragon is easy ur overestimating u dont have to get anywhere near that
Forgot slow falling potions.
A bow and a few blocks would be enough
Way overgeared
Waterbucket
h2o
Hm i dont know, maybe a mid game boss that can be killed with a few beds or a normal bow and some arrows can also be killed with full end game gear
Nah you need end crystals, an elytra and multiple netherite hoes to even stand a chance. Obviously
the only thing you need is some wood and wool
You have to be prepared for if the dragon knocks you into the air. Without featherfalling or a water-mlg you will probably die.
Maybe a few slow falling potion and you good
You forgot the harming potions, if you get yourself down to half a heart with them while you’re in the end fountain, you get invincibility from the dragon
What a garbage gear just get naked and take few beds.
Y'all use armor? X-X
Beds and a bater wucket
i beat it the other day with iron armor, diamond sword, and a bow with like 16 arrows (no enchants), so i'd say yeah.
5/6 beds were enough
More food, thats about it. Perhaps a pumpkin for the endies as well if your worried abt them
Water bucket? Totem? Gapples? Strength potions?
no
still missing at least 4 beds but thats ok
Only 4 bed's is enough ;_;
I dont think u can die with this set😂
need a water bucket or else youll get a suprise from gravity when you get thrown into the air. include beds too
idc bout armor but i always wear a pumpkin to keep the endermen away.
Bro I do it with wooden tools
Myb a slow falling potion
waterbucket
I mean yeah, but I do always bring a water bucket or ended pearls
So much more than enough. You could realistically (so no need to be a pro) beat it with unenchanted iron gear, water, blocks, bow and some steak.
P E R H A P S
A water bucket my dear friend
Yeah i beat the dragon with iron gear honestly. She isn't hard at all.
Definitely need a water bucket
Bro, back in the 360 days iron armour was over prepped
You must’ve did all the side quests first
Man, we used to beat the Ender Dragon with nothing but iron armor and regular bow and arrows.
Uhhhh…. You forget that speedrunners use beds and usually no armor, right? I normally overprepare, as a fellow bedrock player, but this is overkill even for me (also assuming you play alone, get rid of the sword. You don’t need it. Just use the axe, and put sharpness 5 on it. Its only 1 attack point less, and saves inventory.
Insta-damage arrows. At least 2 stacks
I would bring a water bucket and some ender pearls if you have any in case the dragon hits you off the island or in the air you can throw a pearl to get back on the island, you can also use the water to land, climb pillers, and be safe from enderman
 Ended dragon will actually be rizzed up by ur armour
Don’t bring your netherite shovel/pick/regular axe into the fight. Put them in the ender chest for safekeeping they won’t make much of a difference in this fight. Use slightly less expensive tools in case you lose them!
You are severely over prepared. You will be fine
You 64 enchanted apples, the is just too hard.

Also the rest fill it with beds for the vine and sleep in the end.
Back in the day, when I only had diamond...
You should bring some water, just in case you have to mlg.
ur super screwed u dont stand a chance
I did it with iron and a infinity bow your fine
Not nearly
I recommend also taking ender pearls and golden apples.
Why are you taking that many torches with you?
Beds
Yes and no, you need beds
    You don't need beds. I've done the dragon fight countless times and have never used a bed.
No you need ender pearls beds snowballs eggs trees bonemeal water and lava tnt a beacon 10000 charged creepers 2 wardens a zombie with diamond or netherite and 5 friends hope i helped :)
Bro, relax u are not kevin...
beds bro, and a bazooka or two wouldn’t hurt
I'd recommend Creative Mode
Ender pearls to get back to the island when the dragon yeets you
The rest of the protection enchants
You can use unenchanted diamond and still win. But you should pack plenty of water buckets
Bro if anything your over prepared
Use a potion of slow falling and scaffolding. Easiest way to do it fr fr
Missing water bucket
You probably need a few water buckets for the enderman
I would also recommend bringing some ender pearls, a water bucket and maybe even some slow fall potions so when the ender dragon hits you up in the sky you won't die from fall damage, other than that you are pretty much invincible lol.
bro just wasted like 1h on geting netherite when u can beat the ender dragon with iron arrmor lol
A spare set of Power X armor, another Protection XXV sword.... and maybe a Sharpness CXXV Bow and around 69 more arrows.

With that, you should be able to get to get the dragon to half [health](https://health.you) . You need another player and a miracle to fully kill it...
Get some potions of slow falling!
Yes is perfect
Pearls water bucket
OP still gonna get their ass kicked by One Single Baby Zombie

            LTN:
Actually this is bedrock. So you need beds, but also some other stuff like:

Lava bucket

Projectile (bow and arrow should do it)

Blocks

Obsidian/crying obsidian 

(Edit, forgot it before oopsy): Malee weapon (anything, even a pickaxe can do if you know how to do so)

And of course - beds (3 of them to be exact)

(Sorry but as a speedrunner it was kinda bothering me lol)
    What would a lava bucket do?
        Push the dragon down so it won't fly away too fast, giving you time to explode the other 2 beds
            I guess that can be useful but I’ve been playing on bedrock for so long you don’t need anything other than a bow, some armour, and some blocks
                You are right, that is all you need to defeat it (you can also do it without armour, but then if you look at the eyes of an enderman you are a bit screwed). However, what I was talking about is what you need to one cycle (in other ways, what you need for the fastest way to kill the dragon). With a bow you can defeat it in probably around like 3-10 minutes, but with one cycle it is more like a minute.
        what even is a malee weapon?
            A melee weapon is a weapon you use by punching the mob head on. Swords, pickaxes, shovels, axes, hoes, and tridents can all function as melee weapons. Bows and Crossbows are not.
                I knew that a melee weapon is what you‘ve described, just wanted to know what a malee weapon is
                    I think it was just a misspelling
    I’ve never used beds before, can you explain to me why you should? (genuine question)
        The Minecraft developers decided (a long time ago) that it can be funny to make beds explode if you try to sleep in the nether/end. So they made it a thing, and made the explosion slightly stronger than tnt. So speedrunners utilised it to kill the dragon really fast by exploding beds in a certain way near the dragon head, making it take tons of damage.

Now because dragon mechanics are different between java and bedrock, there is a different setup, with the bedrock setup being slightly more complicated (as you can see from the resources I listed, compared to java which is obsidian, a few blocks and 4+ beds for the standard setup), but it still works and still is faster than any other way of killing the dragon...
            I see, I know about the beds exploding. I just thought you meant it was a necessity to use beds which is what confused me. Thank you for explaining
        Beds explode when you sleep in them in the End. If you place them at the right time you can do massive damage to the Dragon, 3 beds is enough to kill it if you time it right
    why use beds when you can one shot dragon
        What do you mean one shot the dragon?
        What is blud yappin bout
        Because it's bedrock so one shot doesn't exist

Plus the non tas version of one shot is slightly slower than one cycle, and a lot slower than zero cycle, so it won't be faster and it is harder.
    I think You can beat it in peaceful mode but yeah that MIGHT be necessary in hard
    We all just gonna skip passed “Malee weapon,” huh >_>
Speedrunners also be like: what is armor
    XD
 happy cake day !
Honestly it's not even difficult...

But i do recommend the classic way because it's more interesting than waiting for a perch and timing bed explosions
    agreed, i do it the classic way every single time, no questions asked. Its just a lot more fun that way!
Bow and one arrow btw(oneshot strat)
Me be like: 
BANZAIIIIIIII (sprinting with a wooden sword)
that was so funny
I'm so bad at this game I just make a double chest of stone swords and some carved pumpkins and go bop his nose.
    Honestly this feels like the best strat if you are not in hardcore mode. 
Put up a chest full of stone swords and building blocks. Go in, get the crystals, don't be afraid of dying. Especially considering how shit bedrock edition is (dying to nothing).
        Been playing bedrock for years, never died to "nothing".  👍
            Seen a lot of videos of people dying to bugs. It does happen rare, but for that reason I wouldn't overgear into the End dimension. Maybe nether as well.
                In my years of playing it I've seen some bugs but never any that caused me to die or even hindered my gameplay at all, for that matter.
                    Long time since i played Bedrock, but back then the game glitched when you bridged to fast. It would not really place a block but you were able to crouch on to it and fell into the void
                        That's an Internet problem. Even playing on really slow devices I've never had that happen offline, only when playing multiplayer with friends or on servers and I had bad ping. I mean I guess it is technically still a bug, but it's multiplayer only and won't happen if you have good connection.
                            Oh that's true. It happened when playing on realms.
                    The only bugs I seem to remember are ones that helped me. Infinite XP, infinite fishing, infinite furnace fuel etc. All bedrock exclusive bugs iirc
                        My bedrock game crashed a while ago and when I went back in it duped my enchanted diamond armour
                    Yeah people just join the hate train for no reason, some never even played bedrock and cry
                        Yeah, what does it have to do with glitched deaths tho?
            Nether portal loading 

Lag while flying with elytra 

Etc
                Omg I had one nether portal that caused suffocation/drowning damage while you loaded it. I would always throw something through to pre load it otherwise a slow connection could kill you.
            ive also played bedrock for years and I haven't died for "nothing" but i have died a lot to stupid bugs like the one where dragon brrath instantly kills you even with full armor and totem
            Same, I see videos of bedrock players dying to bugs all the time, but it hasn't happened to me even once
    If it's ridiculous but it works, then it's not ridiculous.
He's forgetting about the water bucket
showing up late
recommending a water bucket instead of potion of slowfalling to a clearly inexperienced player is peak reddit
    It's still useful though if you're willing to wait for the water to flow all the way down the tower. Also, if you're playing with friends, you can place water at the bottom of the tower. Also, water comes in handy if you get yourself into a tussle with endermen
        Yeah but instamine netherrack would be even better then waiting. Or get knocked off.
    It's still useful outside of waterbucket clutches though
        also good against enderman
        Back in my days we called them waterbucket MLGs
    The water bucket isn't for fall damage. It's for standing in if you accidentally aggro a bunch of endermen.  That's huge if you're a beginner. 

Your assumption is peak reddit.
    It's good to make a safe area from angry enderman and to make a stream to go down the towers.
    >clearly inexperienced player

In full netherite 

>instead of potion of slowfalling

Not useful against Endermen
    You can just place it on the side of the pillar and ride it down lol
lesgo. now defeat the wither, and the warden, at once.
    Can’t we just have them fight each other lol
        Something something secret life
        I'm pretty sure the warden bodies the wither.
            I’ve never managed to kill either so you may be right
        Ooh creative mode time
    Now defeat me 😈
        ur not him
            I am him
                nuh uh
                    Ok sorry
    Wither on bedrock 💀
Bit of advice when you get the elytra: ALWAYS have land in sight when flying in the end. It is super easy to get disoriented in the end.
    My friend made that mistake once, he lost a hardcore world to it. It looked so scary from his pov, just the paper doll in the corner and coordinates to tell if he was plummeting to his death or not.
    I've gotten to the point now where I put an unbreaking enchant book and an anvil in an ender chest and enchant my elytra with it before I ever put it on. I've had my elytra break so many times while flying over the void.
Congrats!!!
Gg my dude. Enjoy looking arround for elytra and making exp farm
MY MAN!!
Nice..... now do it on pocket edition
    There's no way to garentee this wasn't mobile as pocket edition hasn't been a thing since june 8th 2017 (better together update) as you can Bluetooth controller with mobile making it easier
        All you need is the latest bluetooth version and an xbox one controller at minumum
            Yes neither of which are uncommon  and I do it with my ps4 controller just fine
        The one and only time I've killed the dragon was on pocket edition. 

I dont even bother with the dragon anymore though. I just go to the end with an inventory half full of leaves and bridge my way out to the islands. Usually doesn't take too long. And since endermen don't spawn on leaf blocks I don't have to worry about one going agro and knocking me off.
        It was on switch.
            Fair enough
        Pocket has a different menu
            Again Bluetooth controller tho I don't blame you for not believing me
NIIIICE
LETSGOO CONGRATS
YEAH CONGRSTS
Bring two buckets and then make an infinite source, running back and forth placing random water source blocks all around the island so no matter how high the dragon knocks you you can land in one. No solution for it knocking you 200 blocks horizontally away from the island though
    epearl
        Alright throw an enderpearl 200 blocks then
            lol if you're high up in the air that's easy
                Duh but that just shows you’ve never been flung out 100+ blocks away from the island while keeping the y level either the same or lower. You ain’t surviving that with a pearl
                    That would never happen unless you are close to the edge
                        Which is something you have to do at least once, and twice if you’re a speed runner. You are on the edge when you spawn in, and you wait at the edge for the dragon to perch when you’re speed running. Lose focus for a couple seconds and that mf will send you flying into the abyss
Slow falling is annoying when you are trying to jump and hit the dragon when she comes down. You'll end up with less hits.
    Milk
You dont need that. Just use iron armor and tols and a water bucket
    tols
Reddit in a nutshell
A flying machine on bedrock is so much worse  to build than on Java.... OP DO IT
proof or gtfo
oh this ain't my first time. I just acting like I am for karma
I’m serious about Dragons breath it can be used to make lingering arrows and lingering potions. So I recommend just getting like 9 bottles and filling those so it doesn’t over clutter your inventory when you fill them, but at least you’ll have a few
It's a bit of both. If it weren't for reddit I would have forgotten the water bucket. I just saw an op to farm karma
    lol u only need beds to kill dragon it's super easy. without beds just iron armor and a bow with like 32arrows is fine
fall damage:
He doesn't reset each time you die?
    Not in my experience on bedrock.
It’s possible they don’t want to exploit beds
You don't need beds. I've done the dragon fight countless times and have never used a bed.

                    That's an Internet problem. Even playing on really slow devices I've never had that happen offline, only when playing multiplayer with friends or on servers and I had bad ping. I mean I guess it is technically still a bug, but it's multiplayer only and won't happen if you have good connection.
                        Oh that's true. It happened when playing on realms.
                The only bugs I seem to remember are ones that helped me. Infinite XP, infinite fishing, infinite furnace fuel etc. All bedrock exclusive bugs iirc
                    My bedrock game crashed a while ago and when I went back in it duped my enchanted diamond armour
                Yeah people just join the hate train for no reason, some never even played bedrock and cry
                    Yeah, what does it have to do with glitched deaths tho?
        Nether portal loading 

Lag while flying with elytra 

Etc
            Omg I had one nether portal that caused suffocation/drowning damage while you loaded it. I would always throw something through to pre load it otherwise a slow connection could kill you.
        ive also played bedrock for years and I haven't died for "nothing" but i have died a lot to stupid bugs like the one where dragon brrath instantly kills you even with full armor and totem
        Same, I see videos of bedrock players dying to bugs all the time, but it hasn't happened to me even once
If it's ridiculous but it works, then it's not ridiculous.
It's still useful though if you're willing to wait for the water to flow all the way down the tower. Also, if you're playing with friends, you can place water at the bottom of the tower. Also, water comes in handy if you get yourself into a tussle with endermen
    Yeah but instamine netherrack would be even better then waiting. Or get knocked off.
It's still useful outside of waterbucket clutches though
    also good against enderman
    Back in my days we called them waterbucket MLGs
The water bucket isn't for fall damage. It's for standing in if you accidentally aggro a bunch of endermen.  That's huge if you're a beginner. 

Your assumption is peak reddit.
It's good to make a safe area from angry enderman and to make a stream to go down the towers.
>clearly inexperienced player

In full netherite 

>instead of potion of slowfalling

Not useful against Endermen
You can just place it on the side of the pillar and ride it down lol
Can’t we just have them fight each other lol
    Something something secret life
    I'm pretty sure the warden bodies the wither.
        I’ve never managed to kill either so you may be right
    Ooh creative mode time
Now defeat me 😈
    ur not him
        I am him
            nuh uh
                Ok sorry
Wither on bedrock 💀
My friend made that mistake once, he lost a hardcore world to it. It looked so scary from his pov, just the paper doll in the corner and coordinates to tell if he was plummeting to his death or not.
I've gotten to the point now where I put an unbreaking enchant book and an anvil in an ender chest and enchant my elytra with it before I ever put it on. I've had my elytra break so many times while flying over the void.
There's no way to garentee this wasn't mobile as pocket edition hasn't been a thing since june 8th 2017 (better together update) as you can Bluetooth controller with mobile making it easier
    All you need is the latest bluetooth version and an xbox one controller at minumum
        Yes neither of which are uncommon  and I do it with my ps4 controller just fine
    The one and only time I've killed the dragon was on pocket edition. 

I dont even bother with the dragon anymore though. I just go to the end with an inventory half full of leaves and bridge my way out to the islands. Usually doesn't take too long. And since endermen don't spawn on leaf blocks I don't have to worry about one going agro and knocking me off.
    It was on switch.
        Fair enough
    Pocket has a different menu
        Again Bluetooth controller tho I don't blame you for not believing me
epearl
    Alright throw an enderpearl 200 blocks then
        lol if you're high up in the air that's easy
            Duh but that just shows you’ve never been flung out 100+ blocks away from the island while keeping the y level either the same or lower. You ain’t surviving that with a pearl
                That would never happen unless you are close to the edge
                    Which is something you have to do at least once, and twice if you’re a speed runner. You are on the edge when you spawn in, and you wait at the edge for the dragon to perch when you’re speed running. Lose focus for a couple seconds and that mf will send you flying into the abyss
Milk
tols
lol u only need beds to kill dragon it's super easy. without beds just iron armor and a bow with like 32arrows is fine
Not in my experience on bedrock.
PHILZA!!! LOOK OUT!!!!!
    PHILZAAAA!!!!!!!
        NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

Push the dragon down so it won't fly away too fast, giving you time to explode the other 2 beds
    I guess that can be useful but I’ve been playing on bedrock for so long you don’t need anything other than a bow, some armour, and some blocks
        You are right, that is all you need to defeat it (you can also do it without armour, but then if you look at the eyes of an enderman you are a bit screwed). However, what I was talking about is what you need to one cycle (in other ways, what you need for the fastest way to kill the dragon). With a bow you can defeat it in probably around like 3-10 minutes, but with one cycle it is more like a minute.
what even is a malee weapon?
    A melee weapon is a weapon you use by punching the mob head on. Swords, pickaxes, shovels, axes, hoes, and tridents can all function as melee weapons. Bows and Crossbows are not.
        I knew that a melee weapon is what you‘ve described, just wanted to know what a malee weapon is
            I think it was just a misspelling
The Minecraft developers decided (a long time ago) that it can be funny to make beds explode if you try to sleep in the nether/end. So they made it a thing, and made the explosion slightly stronger than tnt. So speedrunners utilised it to kill the dragon really fast by exploding beds in a certain way near the dragon head, making it take tons of damage.

Now because dragon mechanics are different between java and bedrock, there is a different setup, with the bedrock setup being slightly more complicated (as you can see from the resources I listed, compared to java which is obsidian, a few blocks and 4+ beds for the standard setup), but it still works and still is faster than any other way of killing the dragon...
    I see, I know about the beds exploding. I just thought you meant it was a necessity to use beds which is what confused me. Thank you for explaining
Beds explode when you sleep in them in the End. If you place them at the right time you can do massive damage to the Dragon, 3 beds is enough to kill it if you time it right
What do you mean one shot the dragon?
What is blud yappin bout
Because it's bedrock so one shot doesn't exist

Plus the non tas version of one shot is slightly slower than one cycle, and a lot slower than zero cycle, so it won't be faster and it is harder.
Been playing bedrock for years, never died to "nothing".  👍
    Seen a lot of videos of people dying to bugs. It does happen rare, but for that reason I wouldn't overgear into the End dimension. Maybe nether as well.
