[[Best level to find diamonds now]]


Hey guys! I just started Minecraft again after a couple of years without playing, and I see how the map functions have changed, where as diamond location has changed with the cave update that's been introduced. I looked up on google and YouTube, but I keep getting 2 different answers of the prime diamond mining level. Is it -54 or -58? I can't settle where to go 😅 

TLDR;
Confused old player haven't played in years and wondering what's the new Diamond level ✌🏼

-58 but I wouldn't recommend branch mining. Exploring caves below y:0 is the best way to find diamonds
    How to find these caves?
Your best way to get diamonds is by searching for huge caves or caves in general. Diamonds will also spawn less when exposed to air. Means for you: Go for caves, and you will eventually find them. Just dig around iron and whatever you find. I for example found yesterday a couple of diamonds in an ancient city (I know this is not a cave, but the generation works the same). And the general levels for diamonds are between 8 and -64 btw.
    I’m pretty sure it’s the other way around and all ores are coded to be exposed to air less
        Thx! I didnt see my mistake.

I like mining around level -53 or -54, so that I don't have to be annoyed by lava lakes.
While branch mining is still very much a valid method of obtaining diamonds, Mojang have been trying to encourage more exploration of the world. As such, diamonds and diamond gear are sometimes more easily found in random structures.

    I would say branch mining is no longer as effective as it was. Going for caves is better. Why: Diamonds will spawn a lot when you are in a cave. But the best levels are between 8 and -64. They will also more likely spawn when not exposed to air. Means when you are in a cave, chances are that they will spawn more likely under other blocks.
        I'm inclined to agree with you. Plus, caving in general is a whole lot more exciting. I think the point I was trying to make is, in older versions (pre caves & cliffs) branch mining was the best way of obtaining diamonds. Now, there are more, better, options.

And i am glad that this is a thing of the past, because this was boring as hell. Now like you said, caving is more excciting and you will find way more stuff on your way. What i like in the new update is, that ancient cities also have a lot of diamonds. I am almost at a stack of diamonds without fortune 3 by just mining diamonds from 2 ancient cities.
    So, you'd say strip mining is completely obsolete?
        Not completely. There's something therapeutic about it, and it can still yield rewards. But personally, I haven't felt the need to branch mine since the new world generation was added.

google exists

            Did you check the official ore distribution for 1.18+? It says between 8 and -64. And not one level where it spawns.
                Did you check that more spawn closer to bedrock?
                    What do you mean? Did i say something wrong? I mean... The ore distribution charts clearly tells you the levels. Now caves are a way better way of finding diamonds.
                        You said that diamons spawn berween 8 and -64. That's true but you don't find the same amount at every level
While -57-58 gives technically more diamonds, if you're at - 54, you're above lava lakes, which saves a lot of time, since you can just water bucket across instead of digging around or stopping.
google
(because clearly you don't know what google is.)
    Wow, what an insightful comment
