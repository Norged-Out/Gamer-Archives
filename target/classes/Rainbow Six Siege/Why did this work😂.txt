[[Why did this worküòÇ]]





Gosh I love tacos
    Anyone who played runescape back in the day knows this trick, except you did it to make them proclaim themselves gey
        Every multiplayer game with text chat has seen this.
            Even before my first multiplayer game people were getting each other to Alt F4 in ICQ lol.
                Damn. Who remembers icq. Are you 32-39?
                    I still remember my original ICQ# 1401276. Last time I checked they have given it away though :(
                        898764 - sub 1m account baby yeah!
                        > Last time I checked they have given it away though :(

Uh-oh!
                    About to turn 33 haha, nice one.
                    I'm not op but I'm 29 and used it
                    That age range also helps in locating you geologically 

Cause it means you are not from germany and quite likely not even from europe, as icq was way more popular with teenagers here, in 2005-2010 

Btw they didnt reassign numbers, they just added digits, I was 9 digits already.
                        ICQ was still around 2005-10? did not know that, thanks for another useless fact to never forget.
                        lol I know ICQ and I am 20 lol
                    I'm 26 and remember ICQ. It was still super popular in Germany in the early 2000s
                    I am 20 and I still used it
                    Look up the term Xennial. Describes a subset of Millenials.
                    It was either "I seek you" or AOL. Perhaps Usenet for those in there mid 40s. I'm feeling old.
                    How about mIRC and seeing "A/S/L?" every 30 seconds in a chat?
                NewGamer5 - "Hey how do I change my FPS? " 

Anyone not born yesterday - "Alt F4"

        I used to Admin a small Minecraft server and as an Admin I could read every players private messages. I seen one player freaking out at another because he lost all his shit in PvP against said player basically just saying "give me back my gear you fucking faggot!" and various other insults over about 5 messages.

Instead of just outright muting him I first did /sudo (player) msg (other player) "I'm sorry for calling you a faggot, I just lose my temper sometimes but I'll try to control it in the future." Then I muted him.

    Well actually internet isn‚Äôt so big at all, not everyone has seen it, only the thousands who upvoted
And the people who downvoted
And the people who didn‚Äôt vote at all
And the people who upvoted but we haven‚Äôt yet counted because people downvoted this
And all the people who will see this after it will be shared to other subs and other platforms
And the people who will hear about this from their friends.
As you see, not so many people will see this post at all so dont worry you can still try it out
        My brain stopped half way reading this

        And all the people in the match who figured it out after the fact and told their Discord server, who then went and tried it, then it was spread to slack and Twitch chats.

I think I even heard about it making its way to tumblr

But the point is, you're good, give it a go.
            I have seen it years ago in siege, and it takes some practise to pull this off. How many times you seen it in game?
                I've seen people try similar things, but I've never seen it successful.
        So your saying everyone who wants to do this needs to downvote it before it gets big
        [deleted]
            Oh I totally forgot console players dont have text chat but if you think it through the players who play both console and PC dont have to count differently due to the fact I just forgot so the math is much more simple and even normal people could understand it other than us. I also noticed that you‚Äôre a man of culture
            This is like making an essay longer by repeating the words.
        You think too much

    Yeah I knew about this before and now I can‚Äôt use it anymore
    This has been around for a decade at least
    You think 12k people is the internet? Oh you sweet summer child.
OP just created a new operator able to hack the enemies in game chat
    That's been there for a while now.
        Nah pretty sure OP just created it
Outstanding move
    They were bamboozled
        Oh yeah, it‚Äôs big brain time.
            They played themselves
    This is how you play 4D Chess
    It would be better if OP typed [TEAM] instead of [ALL]

when you want to get rid of the level 300 spawn peeking doc fast
    Spawnpeekerd deserve to burn in hell. So this is the plan
        inb4 someone says JuSt WaTcH fOr SpaWnpEekErs
            That would work but when I'm a copper 4 level player and their doc is level 400 and a diamond it's not really a fair fight
                I mean at that point when would you get a fair fight
                    That's fair but I'd rather get killed actually inside the building rather than right when I spawn in
            Daddy no
            But it's not hard lol
                Oh watching for them ain't hard at all. I however want rid of them for that very reason; I've gotten sick and tired of the idiots thinking they're good enough to not day peeking from the most common angle on the map, making it a 4v5 before they even get in the building.

I've gotten more sick of the idiots trying and failing and putting the team at a disadvantage than those that succeed while I'm on Attack.
                Idk. Recently I've got spawnkilled 2 times. I literally didn't have the chance to move before I got a headshot and died. "just don't rush like an idiot lmao"

yeah thanks, I haven't moved, but I'll remember not to rush

        It mostly annoys me when they are a high level but doing stupid stuff and lacking in common knowledge of game play. Things like reinforcing next to miras, shooting mozies drones, stealing downs from cav/frost, and reinforcing between bombs.
            Honestly stealing downs from frost only matter if you are in cas or you have a cab that is still alive.
                Look when I‚Äôm playing frost and finishing off the guy on the mat is the only kill I‚Äôm getting this game, you better let me have it.
        For real, the amount people use level as if it matters makes me want to make a smurf tbh, just because I‚Äôm a high level doesn‚Äôt mean shit when I haven‚Äôt played the game much in the past 4 months, get shit call outs from teammates, or am just having an unlucky day. Despite this teammates in ranked act like having a high level means shit other than having map knowledge and knowing a few tips and tricks all of which don‚Äôt matter if I get flanked or my whole team dies because they push one doorway.
Damn I've never thought to use that that way. I've done stuff like making it look like one guy said "don't bring bandit I have a strat" and they didn't bring a bandit for chalet basement. No idea if it was actually because of what I typed though

                            I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse for an Echo main, not being allowed to play at all in ranked or having to play with an unorganized team on a random site in casual.

                I mean, being a toxic asshole is a pretty bad thing even in a scenario where people are trying to have fun. "Its just a game" isnt really a justification to treating other people like garbage. This video just felt like a ckever trick though, it wasnt toxic.

    siege actually reminded me racism exists, i had forgotten racist slurs until i started playing siege. how fucked up is that lol
        Racism didn't exist *until* siege came out
        How the fuck did you forget racial slurs? Have you never heard a rap song?
            I dont listen to rap
        Do you play on US? It doesnt happen often in EU
        Damn, you must have a pretty good safe space going for you.
        Yo does reddit not remind you about this everyday or what
Everyone complaining about toxicity in Siege but as soon as "le epic funny troll results in tk" hits front page of reddit everyone wants to do the same
Can we stop encouraging people who smurf to copper? This sub always whines about smurfs but apparently it‚Äôs okay when it‚Äôs a funny video on Reddit.
    Ditto for toxicity.

        Little blue dudes mining for earth metals
    Thank you.
    I don't like this smurf account, but this was something that could be done at nearly all levels of gameplay
        Higher level players are more likely to have mics to deny this
        I‚Äôve seen diamonds fall for this trick so that‚Äôs not saying much
    I'm not saying its good, but my friends tried to derank to copper 4 and they said it took them forever. Like 5 stack had to abandaon a lot of matches and still took a while. I hear copper 4 is all diamonds bascially
        Why would you abandon matches to derank? That‚Äôs the dumbest way to do it if you have a 5 stack. All you have to do is rush spawn immediately, die, then surrender. If you abandon matches you get a 15 minute ban starting when the match ends. If you rush and surrender you can fit 2-3 losses in the span of time it took you only get one loss from an abandon.
            Spawn rushing is the more fun way anyway, Everyone recruit shotgun and go ham

My regular team likes to do it in casual for funsies , Sometimes it even accidentally works
Great way to make the game even more toxic than it already is!
OP is an unapologetic toxic smurf. Check his other submissions. Dude's a complete douchebag.
    You mean someone named Bullyingcoppers is a prick? No way

    Super ironic that by in large the community wants a toxic free game environment, while at the same time will pay money in order to reward someone for being toxic.
        "by and large" fyi
            but I always buy em large.
        People are dumb. R6S is one of the best game I ever played, but there's so much toxicity I uninstalled it. People complain about being spawnkilled but they will kick you out if you pick "their" Doc. They think that the others are the problem, but this post shows the TRUE problem : toxicity is appreciated. 14k people upvoted that, but among them, how many would have enjoyed being killed bc of some 13yo kid ? These 14k people should uninstall the game. They don't deserve to play it.
            Nobody ELSE should be toxic. Except me.
                You got it
Just gonna leave these here.

    Wow I forgot about that one. Nothing will probably happen though, which sucks :/
[removed]
    I'm with you. The community complains about toxicity and smurfing and yet this dude gets thousands of upvotes all the time. He's a dickhead.
        I have no idea whats going on. Could you explain?
            He‚Äôs a player who purposely plays with smurf accounts to torment lower level players. He has tons of videos of himself using exploit or glitch spots to kill people new to the game or at lower levels.
            Ok so his first line is just to disguise the fact that he's actually typing the second line. Typing [All] Zetaa: makes it seem like Zetaa is saying that to everyone. But it's actually OP, windowlicker
            I also just stumbled on this through /r/all

Looks like he's doing some tomfoolery though

Edit: i figured out haha
Had this happen to me once.

It was a shit day.
This is quite scummy.
Toxicity is through the roof
Fukin toxic
I seriously hate this sub, always crying about smurfs and things like that and every damn time this asshole posts something it gets over 10k upvotes, it‚Äôs just so annoying
What a douchbag
That's toxic
    That's Siege
        It doesn't have to be
            Unfortunately games like Siege seem to attract toxic players like flies.
                It is the same community that threw a hissy fit when they couldn't say slurs anymore.

    Should be reported to ubisoft.

You are smurf and shit on new players, I bet you feel really big rn
    His deleted comment:


*This was casual and I can‚Äôt even Smurf on PC bud, I‚Äôm horrible on MnK but I still get clips in casual*

Dumbass doesn‚Äôt realise you can still see deleted comments.
    Dude is a notoriously duplicitous little asswipe. His entire brand is pulling toxic shit like this for a laugh. It's sad, however there's unfortunately a market for this. This post alone is creeping up on 50k upvotes in less than 24hrs. A lot of people will like, defend, and imitate this for a laugh at the expense of another person. The success of posts like this hold up a mirror to the community and it's a very ugly reflection that stares back.
Fuck off Bullying Coppers, you make this game worse for everyone.

Is this seriously the kind of content that we're letting get to the front page? Toxicity like this that is applauded by the community for some godforsaken reason is why casual is a cesspool of toxicity and is also why I left this game
I spy with my little eye

Yeah it was funny... But toxic at the same time

Wtf is reverse friendly fire? Like FF off?
    If you got rff and you shoot someone the damage is done to you
Fucking brutalized him
Can anyone explain to me what happened In this video?
    Looks like OP picked a player from the other team and pretended to post as him, asking to be TK'd in ALL chat. One of the enemy teammates obliged, forcing the TK'd player to leave the game.
        I'm still wondering what is "TK". Coming from r/all btw.

That guy probably left because he thought someone hacked him.

Haha crazy son of a bitch did it!
My man just discovered code injection. Outstanding move.
Im pretty new to this game, can someone tell me what smurfing is?
    A smurf is when a person already skilled and familiar with the game creates a new account in order to play with newer players. From level 0-50 you have access to the newcomers matchmaking, as well as the casual matchmaking. A proper player who knew the game well enough to be good at it should go straight to Casual and never touch Newcomers, but some people like this decide to play with the new players and as a result, they are a smurf due to their abuse of the system. 

If you're genuinely new and get accused of being a smurf, then that means your probably good enough to play in casual. However there is a difficulty hike as you may come across people of high rank in casual.
        2nd question. What did OP do in this video? People are calling him toxic and all
            Basically he tricked the enemy team into killing one of their own teammates, but pretending to be said teammate, and asking to be killed. He made it seem like it was 2 different people (himself and the enemy teammate) instead of 1 persons message.
                That's a really smart yet twisted strategy. Also the newcomer playlist is pretty toxic, people tk'ing, spawn peeking. While some people might argue that spawnpeeking might not be toxic, I personaly think it is to do that on a server full of newer players. It's no fun
                    Yeah some say casual can be easier to learn on, rather than newcomers being the place people go to learn. If you're in newcomers and know how to spawnpeek, you shouldn't be in newcomers.
Oh that poor guy is probably so confused
When this happened to me I told my team over the mic that I didn't type that and didn't know how they did it. Got TK'd anyway.

EDIT: Yes am copper

why is this getting upvotes? And people here are always talking about how horrible toxicity is I mean look at username it's literally bullyingcoppers so he's ruining other people's experience and you guys are fine with that
[deleted]
    Exactly what it sounds like. 
After you kill a teamamte, for the rest of the game, friendly fire can result in damage to health or death(mostly death). 
It's supposed to stop toxicity and in a way it kinda does but at the same time, it's real annoying when your teammates walk in front of your gun
I don‚Äôt play rainbow, what‚Äôs going on here.
    Pretended to be a player on the other team saying to teamkill him.  The disguise worked.
All warfare is based off deception- Sun Tzu
While I dom'y personally mind such tricks in casual games, screw OP's smurfing, exploiting ass.

Certainly not scripted.
    I totally believe it. 

I doubt it happened first try though.
Roblox used to have an easy way to do this, but they since made names colored and bolded from the usual font to prevent trolling and harassment. I think Siege could benefit from something simple like that. The name of the user could be the team's color and the message text could stay the same white it is now.

Did he impersonate that Zetaa guy?
    Yes
Plot twist u stole this from insta
I don't play rainbow6 but i'm surprised the game doesn't have color coded text chat. I'm a csgo player and text chat is color-coded based on t-side and ct-side, mostly so people don't pull shit like this. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm surprised this game doesn't have it.
That was amazing

Used to do this in eashl (NHL) but then they patched it.

okay so i understand what was typed and why it worked and the general result of it but can someone explain what the words actually meant and what happened.
Imagine being that guy. He left cuz he must have thought his pc got hacked and told the game to kill him lol.

Someone did something like this in an overwatch match, but put ‚Äú[ADMIN]: You have a new message. Type ‚Äú/lo‚Äù to view it.‚Äù

Typing /lo and hitting enter would auto fill to ‚Äú/logout‚Äù I you can figure out what happened to exactly 4 people in the match
Can you get banned already? He's literally posting from a smurf account ON THE GAME'S SUB and still no bans yet. Fucking Ubi being useless again.
Wait thats illegal.
All these people complaining about toxicity in their awesome game.

Alright this is mean but I'll let it slide because it made me chuckle

If this was in ranked I would be way more impressed. But it‚Äôs only a casual match so it‚Äôs not that great.
I got this game 2 weeks ago can someone explain what happened
Very epic gamer move

Fuck I did this on a popular minecraft server a while back. I'm not sure who it was but I did the same shit except after my message I had [Owner : (YouTuber) has joined the game, and holy fuck watching the follow children go bananas in chat when they though their favorate YouTube joined was beautiful. 

Then I got banned by a op.

Ohhhhh i know you, you can go fuck yourself but this was actually funny

Magic, thats the reason why!
You used to be able to do this in the WOW text chat as well. It was hilarious to watch people get into fights over that while you just watch.
This is cool and funny until racists try and make it look like you said some racist shit.

Congratulations, you played yourself.
Anyone who played runescape back in the day knows this trick, except you did it to make them proclaim themselves gey
    Every multiplayer game with text chat has seen this.
        Even before my first multiplayer game people were getting each other to Alt F4 in ICQ lol.
            Damn. Who remembers icq. Are you 32-39?
                I still remember my original ICQ# 1401276. Last time I checked they have given it away though :(
                    898764 - sub 1m account baby yeah!
                    > Last time I checked they have given it away though :(

Uh-oh!
                About to turn 33 haha, nice one.
                I'm not op but I'm 29 and used it
                That age range also helps in locating you geologically 

Cause it means you are not from germany and quite likely not even from europe, as icq was way more popular with teenagers here, in 2005-2010 

Btw they didnt reassign numbers, they just added digits, I was 9 digits already.
                    ICQ was still around 2005-10? did not know that, thanks for another useless fact to never forget.
                    lol I know ICQ and I am 20 lol
                I'm 26 and remember ICQ. It was still super popular in Germany in the early 2000s
                I am 20 and I still used it
                Look up the term Xennial. Describes a subset of Millenials.
                It was either "I seek you" or AOL. Perhaps Usenet for those in there mid 40s. I'm feeling old.
                How about mIRC and seeing "A/S/L?" every 30 seconds in a chat?

    I used to Admin a small Minecraft server and as an Admin I could read every players private messages. I seen one player freaking out at another because he lost all his shit in PvP against said player basically just saying "give me back my gear you fucking faggot!" and various other insults over about 5 messages.

Instead of just outright muting him I first did /sudo (player) msg (other player) "I'm sorry for calling you a faggot, I just lose my temper sometimes but I'll try to control it in the future." Then I muted him.

    And all the people in the match who figured it out after the fact and told their Discord server, who then went and tried it, then it was spread to slack and Twitch chats.

I think I even heard about it making its way to tumblr

But the point is, you're good, give it a go.
        I have seen it years ago in siege, and it takes some practise to pull this off. How many times you seen it in game?
            I've seen people try similar things, but I've never seen it successful.
    So your saying everyone who wants to do this needs to downvote it before it gets big

        Oh I totally forgot console players dont have text chat but if you think it through the players who play both console and PC dont have to count differently due to the fact I just forgot so the math is much more simple and even normal people could understand it other than us. I also noticed that you‚Äôre a man of culture
        This is like making an essay longer by repeating the words.

            I mean at that point when would you get a fair fight
                That's fair but I'd rather get killed actually inside the building rather than right when I spawn in
        Daddy no
        But it's not hard lol
            Oh watching for them ain't hard at all. I however want rid of them for that very reason; I've gotten sick and tired of the idiots thinking they're good enough to not day peeking from the most common angle on the map, making it a 4v5 before they even get in the building.

I've gotten more sick of the idiots trying and failing and putting the team at a disadvantage than those that succeed while I'm on Attack.
            Idk. Recently I've got spawnkilled 2 times. I literally didn't have the chance to move before I got a headshot and died. "just don't rush like an idiot lmao"

    It mostly annoys me when they are a high level but doing stupid stuff and lacking in common knowledge of game play. Things like reinforcing next to miras, shooting mozies drones, stealing downs from cav/frost, and reinforcing between bombs.
        Honestly stealing downs from frost only matter if you are in cas or you have a cab that is still alive.
            Look when I‚Äôm playing frost and finishing off the guy on the mat is the only kill I‚Äôm getting this game, you better let me have it.
    For real, the amount people use level as if it matters makes me want to make a smurf tbh, just because I‚Äôm a high level doesn‚Äôt mean shit when I haven‚Äôt played the game much in the past 4 months, get shit call outs from teammates, or am just having an unlucky day. Despite this teammates in ranked act like having a high level means shit other than having map knowledge and knowing a few tips and tricks all of which don‚Äôt matter if I get flanked or my whole team dies because they push one doorway.

            I mean, being a toxic asshole is a pretty bad thing even in a scenario where people are trying to have fun. "Its just a game" isnt really a justification to treating other people like garbage. This video just felt like a ckever trick though, it wasnt toxic.

Yeah man, pro gamers regularly derank to troll people in copper rank.
We used to do this in AOL and MSN instant messenger
siege actually reminded me racism exists, i had forgotten racist slurs until i started playing siege. how fucked up is that lol
    Racism didn't exist *until* siege came out
    How the fuck did you forget racial slurs? Have you never heard a rap song?
        I dont listen to rap

Thank you.
I don't like this smurf account, but this was something that could be done at nearly all levels of gameplay
    Higher level players are more likely to have mics to deny this
    I‚Äôve seen diamonds fall for this trick so that‚Äôs not saying much
I'm not saying its good, but my friends tried to derank to copper 4 and they said it took them forever. Like 5 stack had to abandaon a lot of matches and still took a while. I hear copper 4 is all diamonds bascially
    Why would you abandon matches to derank? That‚Äôs the dumbest way to do it if you have a 5 stack. All you have to do is rush spawn immediately, die, then surrender. If you abandon matches you get a 15 minute ban starting when the match ends. If you rush and surrender you can fit 2-3 losses in the span of time it took you only get one loss from an abandon.
        Spawn rushing is the more fun way anyway, Everyone recruit shotgun and go ham

My regular team likes to do it in casual for funsies , Sometimes it even accidentally works
You mean someone named Bullyingcoppers is a prick? No way

Super ironic that by in large the community wants a toxic free game environment, while at the same time will pay money in order to reward someone for being toxic.
    "by and large" fyi
        but I always buy em large.
    People are dumb. R6S is one of the best game I ever played, but there's so much toxicity I uninstalled it. People complain about being spawnkilled but they will kick you out if you pick "their" Doc. They think that the others are the problem, but this post shows the TRUE problem : toxicity is appreciated. 14k people upvoted that, but among them, how many would have enjoyed being killed bc of some 13yo kid ? These 14k people should uninstall the game. They don't deserve to play it.
        Nobody ELSE should be toxic. Except me.
            You got it
Shame the mods don't seem to care, given that the post breaks the subs rules.
Gottem
Wow I forgot about that one. Nothing will probably happen though, which sucks :/
I'm with you. The community complains about toxicity and smurfing and yet this dude gets thousands of upvotes all the time. He's a dickhead.
    I have no idea whats going on. Could you explain?
        He‚Äôs a player who purposely plays with smurf accounts to torment lower level players. He has tons of videos of himself using exploit or glitch spots to kill people new to the game or at lower levels.
        Ok so his first line is just to disguise the fact that he's actually typing the second line. Typing [All] Zetaa: makes it seem like Zetaa is saying that to everyone. But it's actually OP, windowlicker
        I also just stumbled on this through /r/all

Looks like he's doing some tomfoolery though

Edit: i figured out haha
That's Siege
    It doesn't have to be
        Unfortunately games like Siege seem to attract toxic players like flies.
            It is the same community that threw a hissy fit when they couldn't say slurs anymore.

His deleted comment:


*This was casual and I can‚Äôt even Smurf on PC bud, I‚Äôm horrible on MnK but I still get clips in casual*

Dumbass doesn‚Äôt realise you can still see deleted comments.
Dude is a notoriously duplicitous little asswipe. His entire brand is pulling toxic shit like this for a laugh. It's sad, however there's unfortunately a market for this. This post alone is creeping up on 50k upvotes in less than 24hrs. A lot of people will like, defend, and imitate this for a laugh at the expense of another person. The success of posts like this hold up a mirror to the community and it's a very ugly reflection that stares back.

He used the chat function to trick the other team to kill one of their own as he was going to be ‚Äúafk‚Äù
Nah it‚Äôs more Speech 100
    I'd say illusion because he makes it appear as if someone else said it, it's not the words that matter
If you got rff and you shoot someone the damage is done to you
Looks like OP picked a player from the other team and pretended to post as him, asking to be TK'd in ALL chat. One of the enemy teammates obliged, forcing the TK'd player to leave the game.
    I'm still wondering what is "TK". Coming from r/all btw.
        team kill
A smurf is when a person already skilled and familiar with the game creates a new account in order to play with newer players. From level 0-50 you have access to the newcomers matchmaking, as well as the casual matchmaking. A proper player who knew the game well enough to be good at it should go straight to Casual and never touch Newcomers, but some people like this decide to play with the new players and as a result, they are a smurf due to their abuse of the system. 

If you're genuinely new and get accused of being a smurf, then that means your probably good enough to play in casual. However there is a difficulty hike as you may come across people of high rank in casual.
    2nd question. What did OP do in this video? People are calling him toxic and all
        Basically he tricked the enemy team into killing one of their own teammates, but pretending to be said teammate, and asking to be killed. He made it seem like it was 2 different people (himself and the enemy teammate) instead of 1 persons message.
            That's a really smart yet twisted strategy. Also the newcomer playlist is pretty toxic, people tk'ing, spawn peeking. While some people might argue that spawnpeeking might not be toxic, I personaly think it is to do that on a server full of newer players. It's no fun
                Yeah some say casual can be easier to learn on, rather than newcomers being the place people go to learn. If you're in newcomers and know how to spawnpeek, you shouldn't be in newcomers.
Exactly what it sounds like. 
After you kill a teamamte, for the rest of the game, friendly fire can result in damage to health or death(mostly death). 
It's supposed to stop toxicity and in a way it kinda does but at the same time, it's real annoying when your teammates walk in front of your gun
Pretended to be a player on the other team saying to teamkill him.  The disguise worked.
Rewarding toxicity, good going mate
Thanks gamer
I totally believe it. 

I doubt it happened first try though.
Yes
Every multiplayer game with text chat has seen this.
    Even before my first multiplayer game people were getting each other to Alt F4 in ICQ lol.
        Damn. Who remembers icq. Are you 32-39?
            I still remember my original ICQ# 1401276. Last time I checked they have given it away though :(
                898764 - sub 1m account baby yeah!
                > Last time I checked they have given it away though :(

Uh-oh!
            About to turn 33 haha, nice one.
            I'm not op but I'm 29 and used it
            That age range also helps in locating you geologically 

Cause it means you are not from germany and quite likely not even from europe, as icq was way more popular with teenagers here, in 2005-2010 

Btw they didnt reassign numbers, they just added digits, I was 9 digits already.
                ICQ was still around 2005-10? did not know that, thanks for another useless fact to never forget.
                lol I know ICQ and I am 20 lol
            I'm 26 and remember ICQ. It was still super popular in Germany in the early 2000s
            I am 20 and I still used it

I used to Admin a small Minecraft server and as an Admin I could read every players private messages. I seen one player freaking out at another because he lost all his shit in PvP against said player basically just saying "give me back my gear you fucking faggot!" and various other insults over about 5 messages.

Instead of just outright muting him I first did /sudo (player) msg (other player) "I'm sorry for calling you a faggot, I just lose my temper sometimes but I'll try to control it in the future." Then I muted him.

And all the people in the match who figured it out after the fact and told their Discord server, who then went and tried it, then it was spread to slack and Twitch chats.

I think I even heard about it making its way to tumblr

But the point is, you're good, give it a go.
    I have seen it years ago in siege, and it takes some practise to pull this off. How many times you seen it in game?
        I've seen people try similar things, but I've never seen it successful.
So your saying everyone who wants to do this needs to downvote it before it gets big

        Oh watching for them ain't hard at all. I however want rid of them for that very reason; I've gotten sick and tired of the idiots thinking they're good enough to not day peeking from the most common angle on the map, making it a 4v5 before they even get in the building.

I've gotten more sick of the idiots trying and failing and putting the team at a disadvantage than those that succeed while I'm on Attack.
        Idk. Recently I've got spawnkilled 2 times. I literally didn't have the chance to move before I got a headshot and died. "just don't rush like an idiot lmao"

It mostly annoys me when they are a high level but doing stupid stuff and lacking in common knowledge of game play. Things like reinforcing next to miras, shooting mozies drones, stealing downs from cav/frost, and reinforcing between bombs.
    Honestly stealing downs from frost only matter if you are in cas or you have a cab that is still alive.
        Look when I‚Äôm playing frost and finishing off the guy on the mat is the only kill I‚Äôm getting this game, you better let me have it.
For real, the amount people use level as if it matters makes me want to make a smurf tbh, just because I‚Äôm a high level doesn‚Äôt mean shit when I haven‚Äôt played the game much in the past 4 months, get shit call outs from teammates, or am just having an unlucky day. Despite this teammates in ranked act like having a high level means shit other than having map knowledge and knowing a few tips and tricks all of which don‚Äôt matter if I get flanked or my whole team dies because they push one doorway.

Why would you abandon matches to derank? That‚Äôs the dumbest way to do it if you have a 5 stack. All you have to do is rush spawn immediately, die, then surrender. If you abandon matches you get a 15 minute ban starting when the match ends. If you rush and surrender you can fit 2-3 losses in the span of time it took you only get one loss from an abandon.
    Spawn rushing is the more fun way anyway, Everyone recruit shotgun and go ham

My regular team likes to do it in casual for funsies , Sometimes it even accidentally works
"by and large" fyi

    You mean the season of "fuck *former* jackal, blitz, cav, and echo mains"

We can't main the ops if we can't play them :^)
        Sure you can!

Just not in ranked, lmao.

:^)
            I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse for an Echo main, not being allowed to play at all in ranked or having to play with an unorganized team on a random site in casual.
                Ranked teams are organized? Til
Well I mean he does it because he thinks it‚Äôs funny.

I mean, being a toxic asshole is a pretty bad thing even in a scenario where people are trying to have fun. "Its just a game" isnt really a justification to treating other people like garbage. This video just felt like a ckever trick though, it wasnt toxic.

        A glorious day for toxic behavior!
I just counted it and came to the same conclusion as you
You got it
It is the same community that threw a hissy fit when they couldn't say slurs anymore.
    Fucking niüÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏èas /s
    Makes you wonder why they wanted to say those slurs so badly
That's a really smart yet twisted strategy. Also the newcomer playlist is pretty toxic, people tk'ing, spawn peeking. While some people might argue that spawnpeeking might not be toxic, I personaly think it is to do that on a server full of newer players. It's no fun
    Yeah some say casual can be easier to learn on, rather than newcomers being the place people go to learn. If you're in newcomers and know how to spawnpeek, you shouldn't be in newcomers.
I still remember my original ICQ# 1401276. Last time I checked they have given it away though :(
    898764 - sub 1m account baby yeah!
    > Last time I checked they have given it away though :(

Uh-oh!
About to turn 33 haha, nice one.
I'm not op but I'm 29 and used it
That age range also helps in locating you geologically 

Cause it means you are not from germany and quite likely not even from europe, as icq was way more popular with teenagers here, in 2005-2010 

Btw they didnt reassign numbers, they just added digits, I was 9 digits already.
    ICQ was still around 2005-10? did not know that, thanks for another useless fact to never forget.
    lol I know ICQ and I am 20 lol
I'm 26 and remember ICQ. It was still super popular in Germany in the early 2000s
I am 20 and I still used it
Look up the term Xennial. Describes a subset of Millenials.
It was either "I seek you" or AOL. Perhaps Usenet for those in there mid 40s. I'm feeling old.
How about mIRC and seeing "A/S/L?" every 30 seconds in a chat?
Got temp banned for this once
You forgot yours too
That's fair but I'd rather get killed actually inside the building rather than right when I spawn in
