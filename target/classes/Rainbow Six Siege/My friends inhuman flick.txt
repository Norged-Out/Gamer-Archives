[[My friends inhuman flick]]





Rainbow Six causes reflexes beyond human comprehension
    The rest of the 4 man I was with were just astonished that I hit this, especially as I didn't have my glasses at the time.
        In case you were wondering, I can confirm that this is indeed the inhuman guy.
            hi
                Hi
                    Hi
                        Hi
                            Hi
                                Hey
        Xim = 0 skill
            Bro this is PC lmfao
                He watches too much Jynxi and thinks controller is superior for a tactical shooter.
                just noticed, why would someone want to play pc r6 though? Makes no sense to me
                    why not?

        I have so many questions.

Are you on PC?

Do you play with a mouse?
- if so, what DPI, in-game sensitivity settings do you play with (incl ADS sensitivity settings)?
- how do you grip your mouse?

If you play with a controller then I really have no questions lol

Always wondering how PC players play with such high sensitivities but still have tight control in ADS.
            You need to actually have a lower DPI but flick the mouse wider. The larger range of motion lets you have more accuracy due to easier micro-adjustments. People prioritize light mice on smooth surfaces.
            No questions on a controller? This would be more wild on controller bc that's way faster than max sensitivity
            Yes he is on pc as you can see by the numbers and letters on his screen allocating to keybinds, so that should answer the second question with yes he is using a mouse. I can’t answer what sense he uses but I can tell you his vertical sens is too high for him as you see him pull the gun down too much, and how someone grips their mouse doesn’t really effect much, if it’s a low sens you would preferably want a softer grip to make it easier to fly around your mousepad, and a harder grip for higher sens to get more precision, however the grip usually comes down to preference. And to answer ur last question, you can have different sens for ads and non ads, e.g. a really high non ads and a low ads sens
                the main reason i pulled down so hard is because i was running on just pure adrenaline and also i don't have my glasses so i cant rly see anything but i will reduce it a bit thanks :-)
            1000 dpi and 55 horizontal 50 vertical   
I'm right handed so thumb on left of mouse with my mouse buttons, index and middle on left + right mouse buttons and the rest just sit were they want to.
                Thanks my guy!
                Do you use a different multiplier? 1000 with 50 un ads is crazy high
                    actually I use 55 on both  
and my standard ads is 50
    Yeah sure it does
    Glasses is a funny way of saying aimbot
        I never said glasses?
This is the shit I gotta deal with on console
    I saw a post on another page earlier showing their XIM and multiple people talking about how nothing is wrong is just a preference. Nobody can control sens like that on the sticks and compete.
        I just don’t see how it is so difficult to detect
            it really isn't they just don't want to lose that many people which I'm sure is a lot especially in the high ranks queue times would be as awful as they used to be unless they mash together more ranks to fill lobbies which would make newer players want to leave because they are getting stomped more than they already are by smurfs and late ranked joiners.
            Well here's the thing about programs

What exactly would you be detecting then? If there's an input that matches "mouse" or "keyboard"?

Okay, hackers can mask that by assigning the mnk features as controller keyboards. Not the hardest thing to do

How about detecting insane flicks? Surely this will know right? If someone were to flick 180 within a millisecond, no way a controller can do that right?

Okay, but then you are going to monitor every second of the player and make sure there's no millisecond "input". So performance drops because you need an algorithm that does that constantly. No one likes it. Or even worse. You detect that some mnk never really do 180s, just a lot of random flicks. Which is also common when you jiggle peek. Does that count too?

Problems pile up without a proper solution unless you really go into the kernels and start monitoring the devices in hardware... Are you then willing to sacrifice your privacy for cheat preventions? Riot did it for valorant, it's the better cheat detector than others... But never perfect
                I don't know why you are being downvoted. It's always been a game of cat and mouse regarding these types of issues. And the thing is that it costs money to solve, but others make money by causing the issue. So it's already one-sided.

What is the incentive for Ubisoft to fix the issue when there is no feasible solution and it costs so much money to actively work on it?

The answer is what we have been seeing.
                    That too

It's almost impossible to do anti cheat without losing a chunk of money in the first place. And that honestly creates problems for the company who are trying to actively earn money as revenues...

Well, I don't know why I'm getting down voted either, but at least one person gets it. I'm good with that
        They need to stop the pc r6 cross play comparison honestly speaking there aren’t even that many pc players on ranked I’m always outnumbered by consoles drastically
            Pc does not cross play with xbox? Xbox and playstation can. But neither play with pc players. Thats legit why they are mouse trapping xbox ATM to stop the mnk warriors demolishing controller players.
                Waitt.. what…. so why do all my matches say cross play ranked if it’s only PC… are you kidding me ?  What type of Ronald McDonald BS is that ?
                    Crossplay for PC only functions with Luna. So PC&Luna and separately we have xbox&playstation
                        Have to be trolling me… Luna?!  Amazon gaming broo? Stop the shenanigans
                            Sorry man, not a troll. Straight from ubi
                Also what’s a MNK warrior ?  lol 😂
                    MNK warriors are cheaters on console that use XIM. Ubisoft has gone to directly say that MnK on consoles is cheating
    What’s with everyone talking abt him cheating on console? I don’t see anything that says he’s on console. I’m genuinely just asking not tryna be rude or nothing
        hes saying that he has to deal with xim users that have aim like op's friend on console.
            Yeah ik him but there’s a lot of people mentioning him using xim but it doesn’t even say if he’s on console
                I don’t think people are saying the guy in the clip specifically is on console, just that people on console using a mouse and keyboard can hit flicks like this which would be pretty much impossible on a controller
                The commenter is on console. Not the person in video. He's saying he plays on console and plays against xim users who are not on console.
        People believe Xim is cheating. XIM lets you use keyboard and mouse on console giving you an unfair advantage compared to controllers.
            Xim is cheating
            Not what I asked
                pluh, we're talking about cheating on console because the flick in the video is only possible on mouse and keyboard, also it isn't everyone, this is like the only highly upvoted comment thread talking about cheating on console. The video is only incidentally related to the discussion being had here, its not that complicated.
                    I mean the buttons layout are PC, it would show the dpad on console. like this

not entirely sure tho
                Then that's your fault for asking the wrong question.
                You're being downvoted for being correct.. WILD.

&#x200B;

You: How do you know he's on console?

&#x200B;

Him: Xim is considered cheating.

&#x200B;

You: What? That's.. not what I asked..

            XIM is 100% cheating. Aiming is ridiculously easy on PC. I can stop playing with my friends for a month and come back nearly as good as I left. On console, it takes me a day or two to get back into the feel of it.
        This is a PC clip, but people use a program to play with a mouse on console 

Im commenting to show the contrast between what a mouse can do and what analog sticks can do

It’s physically impossible for a controller to compete with this
    Both you and u/sparten1234 are mistaken. It is impossible to do a flick like this on a XIM or any other MnK adapter, since they are emulating a controller they are confined to what the controller is capable of (analog based movement) and the aim mechanic of the game. A good way to look at it is a  controller that's shaped like a mouse rather than an actual mouse.

There is a turn speed cap for example that you hit easily which means movement isn't 1:1, on top of that a XIM is no where near as precise and accurate as a native mouse input. So we can say it's bad for the game and whatnot but the fact is no XIM player's aim is as good as Beaulo's, Spoits, etc for a reason because its impossible,
        False
            Not false. But to entertain your comment, what exactly are you saying false too?
                It takes me almost half a second to turn around a full 180 

Xim can spin multiple times fully in that time

Any input difference between xjm and pc is negligible in comparison to xim and controller
                    >Any input difference between xim and pc is negligible

Nope it feels way worse. I as a former console player who hadn't played with my best friend in 5 years after his service left him disabled and when the XIM adapter went viral and he got it we were finally both able to play console together and games like R6, which was amazing.

However it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, he would complain about how awful it felt in comparison, his aim was much worse than it was on PC, this is why I made a full switch to PC in 2020 so he wasn't forced to use emulated MnK anymore. So now were still gaming but he's able to fully enjoy himself. I appreciate XIM making things more accessible but you're not going to plug it in and become a God, it is not aim bot.

I've been D1 since Dustline, and I remained so up until I left while only using an Elite Series 1 controller. My seasonal KD my last season on console was 3.1 as well, so if XIM was that much of an advantage then over the years as XIMs grew in popularity and my lobbies went from controller to emulated MnK I would've noticed an increase in difficulty and dropped rank and/or KD but none of those things happened, my KD only rose each season despite the adapters and I continued to perform just fine. 

People blaming XIM on there ranks are making excuses, as someone who has a 1:1 comparison from both my best friend and from now being a PC player PC players have wayyy better aims and flicks, XIM is at best only slightly better than a pro controller in some regards, but it also has massive disadvantages too in other regards.

>Xim can spin multiple times fully in that time

They can't move any faster than someone on max sensitivty can
                        I mean, ubisoft themselves went ahead and said Mnk on console is cheating because it gives an unfair advantage
                            My response to that is two things

1 - Them offering an opinion it's an unfair advantage is just that, it doesn't mean it is a massive advantage 

2 - They actually didn't classify it as cheating, they said when they launched the mouse trap update they did not want to remove the MnK adapaters for those who need it, so they allow you to play matches with it still they just add input latency and increase the latency the higher your skill level is. So mnK adapters are not cheating as per Ubisoft according to there own words, they could ban and sanction players using it if it were
                                They actually did classify it as cheating.https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/65UBprZeK2lHJw1qKI8ygM/mouse-and-keyboard-anticheat-feature-on-consoles#:~:text=Mouse%20and%20Keyboard%20on%20Consoles&text=It's%20one%20of%20the%20biggest,address%20this%20form%20of%20cheating. First paragraph, second to last sentence
                                    Bypassing mouse trap is considered cheating, using mnk adapaters are not if you read the accessibility section in your own link that gives insight into why they're not banning people for it and instead are only adding input latency to "level the playing field"
                        I don’t think you understand how big of a difference it is
                            I think I do. I played against it for years, 3kd, not a big deal
                                1000 console players with 10k hours played vs 1000 xim players with 10k hours played

Xim wins pretty consistently probably around 75% of the tike
    Wait last time I heard of XIM it seemed to be that it couldn’t go past a “controller sensitivity” or something odd like that, wtf happened?
I would be sooooo mad 😭
    My reflexes would be just as quick.... to turn the xbox off
        360-noscope the console towards the trashcan
            😎👉 you got it bro!
The edgy 12 year olds gonna love this one 😂
    Editing was laughable
        Fr cringe
        Bro gave himself the Peaky Blinders edit 💀
bro was on 3 adderalls and a redbull. heart rate at 155
    My heart rate is 155 just on the treadmill lmao, 200 is more like it
    I think more like 200 lol
Hiko are you kidding me?!?!
    I think you mean WHAT OMG INHIMAN REACTIONS!!!!!!!!
        bahahahh  you're right
It’s like he’s got eyes in the back of his head
    Or, you know... ears.
    That’s why you stay quiet in this game.
Me: decides to play r6 after a year

Random mfker who only plays r6:
Special forces.
For the ones claiming it's cheating, if you look closely he overshoots just a bit before correcting onto the target. Nice clip though!
    That's what new hacks do btw
        Oh I didn't know that, but the clip seems way too human like the frantic recoil control upon shooting
            They try to work around mousetrap as much as possible 

xim is cheating btw dont ket anyone tell you otherwise
                Oh no I agree 100% that xim is cheating. Although it's sad that some ximmers still die to my 25 sensitivity self lol
                    Gotta keep in mind that hacks have progressed a long way from the 2000s... they do have more AI controlled legit sprays, etc.
                        Theyre forgetting something

Any kind of outside software that modifies your in game ability against platers outside of what you would normally do

Is cheating

It doesnt matter how it works if it modifies the game in an unintended way its cheats
                Xim is cheating but the guy in the clip is on PC
                This clip is on PC, Xim has nothing to do with it
            Yeah it uses ai to aim bot
                It rubs the lotion on its skin
    Not saying he’s cheating but that’s not a good point out. Most hacks now have a way to adjust recoil and accuracy so it’s just human enough. The hacks if you adjust them right will miss shots on purpose.
Ur friend hacking
    If having ears is considered hacking, then I hope we all get banned.
    I’m average at mnk and hit flicks like this fairly frequently. It’s not an insane feat.
    u must play on console xD
        Tbf, this would be cheating on console
where is the 16:9 video?
    there is one on my yt
We were all kids once, I think I went through 3-4 copies of the original CS because my
Game kept getting banned for hacking, I was 12 okay.
I used to randomly shoot walls like this and have landed some questionable headshots from it
As an old pc ranked player who has tried console r6, XIM gotta be so overpowered. The movement you see at high ranked pc games is insane, couldn't imagine some controller player trying to fight that.
I hit this flick every time a teammate comes around a corner a lil too fast lmao
    Same.
Now thats crazy 😲🍗
Bro got the best gaming chair on the market
"Flick"....sure 😂
    It was too slow fr
Nice hax bro. Fr these kids need to stop thinking they cool because you play a video game, especially cheating in one
    lol if u think you needs cheats to do this u just suck
        If you say this shit you do suck but you still tell people to "git gud"
            Oh wow u really exposed me
    Being better than you is not hax
        True so git gud
            I rarely play and even I know that that’s not hax
                Sounds like you don't then
                    But I do
                        This is childish back and forth, you're cringe
                            What are you a 10 year old who unironically calls someone cringe without even using it properly
                                The proper form of cringe? Pretentious lil bitch aren't ya?
                                    Nope your just using the word completely wrong
what is dudes sens
    101
        On 800,000 DPI
    Way too high.
    1000 CPI and 55 on siege
Sixth sense: ACTIVATED.
it was a recoil kill. slow down the video and youll see. the second or third bullet was the headshot
We all have strokes of luck like this every now and then, were he consistently doing this, something is sus
    This was a one off for sure, ill probably never do something like this ever again
He mastered the recoil pattern of that gun on mnk. That's all I see. 👁️
No 1.5?
    Na, I dont know what it is but i just prefer this Russian sight to the 1.5
        Same 1.5 feels off. This sight I use on most guns
fmg on smoke?? blasphemy
    lol
I remember my fastest inhuman flick. I turned so fast and zoomed in 1 tap his head. They thought I was cheating for the rest of the game 😭
    A chunk of the people here think i was in this clip
        Well that sucks for you. Pin a comment saying "that is not me" maybe? Since some people ignore the title.
            oh no it is me in the clip i just wasn't cheating  
my friend was the one who posted it
Tell me you complain about aim assist without telling me you complain about aim assist
    PC FOR THE WIN
If you slow it down he gets the headshot with recoil. That aint hacks bro
Stuff like this makes me feel I'm getting too old for this, lol
If it wasn't cut for tiktok it would look a lot less sussy, the fact he flicks to an off-screen target from our POV makes it look fishy

NS
    yeah it was for my YT thats why i can understand why ppl say its cheating.
He flicked an locked on with the precision of a Jackal Sniper on a legendary playthrew of halo 2 lol.
It sure is inhuman, because it’s almost certainly cheating
    Looks clean to me. Flicks a little left of the enemy, fires a first shot that misses. Super lucky recoil off that first shot moves the crosshair to perfect placement for the second shot. It’s rare but I would wager most people have pulled a shot like this at least once if they’ve played for years.
        This was 100% a once in a life time shot for me
            When I say a shot like this I mean similar, but not necessarily the full 90 degrees flick! Nice clip
                thank you :-)
This definitely isn't a call for the guy hacking. Some people are just really good. I used to be able to do stuff like this when I was in high school on console shooters, definitely easier with M&KB. We're all just washed up compared to kids now.
    This ain't me being good it was just a very lucky one off
    He’s not good though. Guy can’t even control recoil and it’s a casual match. Plus he’s not using 1.5 on fmg
        " He’s not good though. Guy can’t even control recoil and it’s a casual match. Plus he’s not using 1.5 on fmg "

            :3 get better
Looks a little sus
These comments are unreal. There’s no way people actually think this is cheating lmao
    Yeah people just don't like people getting one-off kills like I did here
        No hate to u btw it’s just crazy people are this dumb
            yeah but I was pretty crazy with this kill lol
                It's more that you couldn't have possibly known he was there, and then a perfect flick to the forehead as soon as they walk in the room. Textbook aimbot coding 🤷🏻‍♂️
                    I saw him for literally a frame the 16:9 is on my yt if you want to look at it
Bunch of dogshit players in here that just can’t fathom that something like this would ever be possible. I dont even play this game lol
    So how would you know something like this or anything that is possible in a game you havnt played? Curious?
        Because I’m a crimson II ranked play sweat in Call of Duty and play with other really good players. I like to think that I have a good eye for cheaters.
            Yea these are just dogass players 💀💀 He's clearly on PC and just got a lucky flick
He instantly rotated almost 90 degrees and immediately tracked to his head? Pretty sus....
    I mean, the recoil got the kill so the gun wasn’t at head during kill.
anyone who thinks this is hacks needs to stop being bad at the game
Other guy just came home from work after a long BS day. Then kids like this fuck up the rest of it
"My friend" "Inhumane"

**"ME"** **AIMBOT"**
XIM
Find new friends xd
Totally not an aimbot guys, i swear
Wonder how much he paid for that script. "Flicking" with perfect accuracy to someone that's not on screen is one of the easiest giveaways. The math on human reaction time doesn't help either.
    Smartest console player
        I'm on PC and I play a lot of Apex. I know cheating when I see it, because Respawn doesn't do shit about it. Anyway it's the off screen flick that gives it away. If that dude showed up on the far side of the screen and he snaps to it, fair play. Snapping to someone you can't even see is the giveaway.
Cheating more like
I've never played this game and know nothing about it, but that looks like aimbot to me lol
I can sort of see why people might call him a cheater, as he has terrible mechanics and terrible recoil control not to mention crosshair placement yet he hits a flick shot and it stops right on his head, but I think it’s just that, a lucky flick shot from a new player. That’s why it’s clipped bc he doesn’t hit these all the time it’s a 1 of 1 for him was just lucky
It’s the gaming chair
[deleted]
    Or your likely dosghit
As someone that doesn’t play this game much, are people genuinely saying that’s not cheating?
I just reported him
How do people have fun knowing they have to cheat to win.
    Smartest console player
It's almost like a program assisted him... but I'd just be a hater, right?
How often does he do this? Definitely looks suspicious as fuck and I’ve heard recently how many cheaters play that game 😂😂
[deleted]
    It was for a YT short I had to. Also what was it that i didn't want you to notice exactly?
Bro gave himself the Peaky Blinders edit 💀
If I saw that I would assume you are cheating, God damn
    Yeah I would too tbh but it is 100% not cheating
Master of high sensitivity settings ? Also advanced reaction skills.
This was a great reflex to left ear sound his sensitivity setting is like a 10% factor has nothing to do with it
this is exactly why I'll never play this game
I did a 360 degree flock on a guy shooting at me through a wall on plane (wall was not broken)
CLARA
That’s got to be pc right?
    yep
        Haha. You can always tell. That flick is impossible on a controller. I would love it if I had pc. Don’t have the money for it or gaming time while parenting. But it always feels like a cheat when I face people who are on pc.
The rest of the 4 man I was with were just astonished that I hit this, especially as I didn't have my glasses at the time.
    In case you were wondering, I can confirm that this is indeed the inhuman guy.

                why not?

    I have so many questions.

Are you on PC?

Do you play with a mouse?
- if so, what DPI, in-game sensitivity settings do you play with (incl ADS sensitivity settings)?
- how do you grip your mouse?

If you play with a controller then I really have no questions lol

Always wondering how PC players play with such high sensitivities but still have tight control in ADS.
        You need to actually have a lower DPI but flick the mouse wider. The larger range of motion lets you have more accuracy due to easier micro-adjustments. People prioritize light mice on smooth surfaces.
        No questions on a controller? This would be more wild on controller bc that's way faster than max sensitivity
        Yes he is on pc as you can see by the numbers and letters on his screen allocating to keybinds, so that should answer the second question with yes he is using a mouse. I can’t answer what sense he uses but I can tell you his vertical sens is too high for him as you see him pull the gun down too much, and how someone grips their mouse doesn’t really effect much, if it’s a low sens you would preferably want a softer grip to make it easier to fly around your mousepad, and a harder grip for higher sens to get more precision, however the grip usually comes down to preference. And to answer ur last question, you can have different sens for ads and non ads, e.g. a really high non ads and a low ads sens
            the main reason i pulled down so hard is because i was running on just pure adrenaline and also i don't have my glasses so i cant rly see anything but i will reduce it a bit thanks :-)
        1000 dpi and 55 horizontal 50 vertical   
I'm right handed so thumb on left of mouse with my mouse buttons, index and middle on left + right mouse buttons and the rest just sit were they want to.
            Thanks my guy!
            Do you use a different multiplier? 1000 with 50 un ads is crazy high
                actually I use 55 on both  
and my standard ads is 50
Yeah sure it does
Glasses is a funny way of saying aimbot
    I never said glasses?
I saw a post on another page earlier showing their XIM and multiple people talking about how nothing is wrong is just a preference. Nobody can control sens like that on the sticks and compete.
    I just don’t see how it is so difficult to detect
        it really isn't they just don't want to lose that many people which I'm sure is a lot especially in the high ranks queue times would be as awful as they used to be unless they mash together more ranks to fill lobbies which would make newer players want to leave because they are getting stomped more than they already are by smurfs and late ranked joiners.
        Well here's the thing about programs

What exactly would you be detecting then? If there's an input that matches "mouse" or "keyboard"?

Okay, hackers can mask that by assigning the mnk features as controller keyboards. Not the hardest thing to do

How about detecting insane flicks? Surely this will know right? If someone were to flick 180 within a millisecond, no way a controller can do that right?

Okay, but then you are going to monitor every second of the player and make sure there's no millisecond "input". So performance drops because you need an algorithm that does that constantly. No one likes it. Or even worse. You detect that some mnk never really do 180s, just a lot of random flicks. Which is also common when you jiggle peek. Does that count too?

Problems pile up without a proper solution unless you really go into the kernels and start monitoring the devices in hardware... Are you then willing to sacrifice your privacy for cheat preventions? Riot did it for valorant, it's the better cheat detector than others... But never perfect
            I don't know why you are being downvoted. It's always been a game of cat and mouse regarding these types of issues. And the thing is that it costs money to solve, but others make money by causing the issue. So it's already one-sided.

What is the incentive for Ubisoft to fix the issue when there is no feasible solution and it costs so much money to actively work on it?

The answer is what we have been seeing.
                That too

It's almost impossible to do anti cheat without losing a chunk of money in the first place. And that honestly creates problems for the company who are trying to actively earn money as revenues...

Well, I don't know why I'm getting down voted either, but at least one person gets it. I'm good with that
    They need to stop the pc r6 cross play comparison honestly speaking there aren’t even that many pc players on ranked I’m always outnumbered by consoles drastically
        Pc does not cross play with xbox? Xbox and playstation can. But neither play with pc players. Thats legit why they are mouse trapping xbox ATM to stop the mnk warriors demolishing controller players.
            Waitt.. what…. so why do all my matches say cross play ranked if it’s only PC… are you kidding me ?  What type of Ronald McDonald BS is that ?
                Crossplay for PC only functions with Luna. So PC&Luna and separately we have xbox&playstation
                    Have to be trolling me… Luna?!  Amazon gaming broo? Stop the shenanigans
                        Sorry man, not a troll. Straight from ubi
            Also what’s a MNK warrior ?  lol 😂
                MNK warriors are cheaters on console that use XIM. Ubisoft has gone to directly say that MnK on consoles is cheating
What’s with everyone talking abt him cheating on console? I don’t see anything that says he’s on console. I’m genuinely just asking not tryna be rude or nothing
    hes saying that he has to deal with xim users that have aim like op's friend on console.
        Yeah ik him but there’s a lot of people mentioning him using xim but it doesn’t even say if he’s on console
            I don’t think people are saying the guy in the clip specifically is on console, just that people on console using a mouse and keyboard can hit flicks like this which would be pretty much impossible on a controller
            The commenter is on console. Not the person in video. He's saying he plays on console and plays against xim users who are not on console.
    People believe Xim is cheating. XIM lets you use keyboard and mouse on console giving you an unfair advantage compared to controllers.
        Xim is cheating
        Not what I asked
            pluh, we're talking about cheating on console because the flick in the video is only possible on mouse and keyboard, also it isn't everyone, this is like the only highly upvoted comment thread talking about cheating on console. The video is only incidentally related to the discussion being had here, its not that complicated.
                I mean the buttons layout are PC, it would show the dpad on console. like this

        XIM is 100% cheating. Aiming is ridiculously easy on PC. I can stop playing with my friends for a month and come back nearly as good as I left. On console, it takes me a day or two to get back into the feel of it.
    This is a PC clip, but people use a program to play with a mouse on console 

Im commenting to show the contrast between what a mouse can do and what analog sticks can do

It’s physically impossible for a controller to compete with this
Both you and u/sparten1234 are mistaken. It is impossible to do a flick like this on a XIM or any other MnK adapter, since they are emulating a controller they are confined to what the controller is capable of (analog based movement) and the aim mechanic of the game. A good way to look at it is a  controller that's shaped like a mouse rather than an actual mouse.

There is a turn speed cap for example that you hit easily which means movement isn't 1:1, on top of that a XIM is no where near as precise and accurate as a native mouse input. So we can say it's bad for the game and whatnot but the fact is no XIM player's aim is as good as Beaulo's, Spoits, etc for a reason because its impossible,
    False
        Not false. But to entertain your comment, what exactly are you saying false too?
            It takes me almost half a second to turn around a full 180 

Xim can spin multiple times fully in that time

Any input difference between xjm and pc is negligible in comparison to xim and controller
                >Any input difference between xim and pc is negligible

Nope it feels way worse. I as a former console player who hadn't played with my best friend in 5 years after his service left him disabled and when the XIM adapter went viral and he got it we were finally both able to play console together and games like R6, which was amazing.

However it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, he would complain about how awful it felt in comparison, his aim was much worse than it was on PC, this is why I made a full switch to PC in 2020 so he wasn't forced to use emulated MnK anymore. So now were still gaming but he's able to fully enjoy himself. I appreciate XIM making things more accessible but you're not going to plug it in and become a God, it is not aim bot.

I've been D1 since Dustline, and I remained so up until I left while only using an Elite Series 1 controller. My seasonal KD my last season on console was 3.1 as well, so if XIM was that much of an advantage then over the years as XIMs grew in popularity and my lobbies went from controller to emulated MnK I would've noticed an increase in difficulty and dropped rank and/or KD but none of those things happened, my KD only rose each season despite the adapters and I continued to perform just fine. 

People blaming XIM on there ranks are making excuses, as someone who has a 1:1 comparison from both my best friend and from now being a PC player PC players have wayyy better aims and flicks, XIM is at best only slightly better than a pro controller in some regards, but it also has massive disadvantages too in other regards.

>Xim can spin multiple times fully in that time

They can't move any faster than someone on max sensitivty can
                    I mean, ubisoft themselves went ahead and said Mnk on console is cheating because it gives an unfair advantage
                        My response to that is two things

1 - Them offering an opinion it's an unfair advantage is just that, it doesn't mean it is a massive advantage 

2 - They actually didn't classify it as cheating, they said when they launched the mouse trap update they did not want to remove the MnK adapaters for those who need it, so they allow you to play matches with it still they just add input latency and increase the latency the higher your skill level is. So mnK adapters are not cheating as per Ubisoft according to there own words, they could ban and sanction players using it if it were
                            They actually did classify it as cheating.https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/65UBprZeK2lHJw1qKI8ygM/mouse-and-keyboard-anticheat-feature-on-consoles#:~:text=Mouse%20and%20Keyboard%20on%20Consoles&text=It's%20one%20of%20the%20biggest,address%20this%20form%20of%20cheating. First paragraph, second to last sentence
                                Bypassing mouse trap is considered cheating, using mnk adapaters are not if you read the accessibility section in your own link that gives insight into why they're not banning people for it and instead are only adding input latency to "level the playing field"
                    I don’t think you understand how big of a difference it is
                        I think I do. I played against it for years, 3kd, not a big deal
                            1000 console players with 10k hours played vs 1000 xim players with 10k hours played

Xim wins pretty consistently probably around 75% of the tike
Wait last time I heard of XIM it seemed to be that it couldn’t go past a “controller sensitivity” or something odd like that, wtf happened?
My reflexes would be just as quick.... to turn the xbox off
    360-noscope the console towards the trashcan
        😎👉 you got it bro!
Editing was laughable
    Fr cringe
    Bro gave himself the Peaky Blinders edit 💀
My heart rate is 155 just on the treadmill lmao, 200 is more like it
I think more like 200 lol
I think you mean WHAT OMG INHIMAN REACTIONS!!!!!!!!
    bahahahh  you're right
Or, you know... ears.
That’s why you stay quiet in this game.
That's what new hacks do btw
    Oh I didn't know that, but the clip seems way too human like the frantic recoil control upon shooting
        They try to work around mousetrap as much as possible 

xim is cheating btw dont ket anyone tell you otherwise
            Oh no I agree 100% that xim is cheating. Although it's sad that some ximmers still die to my 25 sensitivity self lol
                Gotta keep in mind that hacks have progressed a long way from the 2000s... they do have more AI controlled legit sprays, etc.
                    Theyre forgetting something

Any kind of outside software that modifies your in game ability against platers outside of what you would normally do

Is cheating

It doesnt matter how it works if it modifies the game in an unintended way its cheats
            Xim is cheating but the guy in the clip is on PC
            This clip is on PC, Xim has nothing to do with it
        Yeah it uses ai to aim bot
            It rubs the lotion on its skin
Not saying he’s cheating but that’s not a good point out. Most hacks now have a way to adjust recoil and accuracy so it’s just human enough. The hacks if you adjust them right will miss shots on purpose.
If having ears is considered hacking, then I hope we all get banned.
I’m average at mnk and hit flicks like this fairly frequently. It’s not an insane feat.
u must play on console xD
    Tbf, this would be cheating on console
there is one on my yt
Same.
It was too slow fr
lol if u think you needs cheats to do this u just suck
    If you say this shit you do suck but you still tell people to "git gud"
        Oh wow u really exposed me
Being better than you is not hax
    True so git gud
        I rarely play and even I know that that’s not hax
            Sounds like you don't then
                But I do
                    This is childish back and forth, you're cringe
                        What are you a 10 year old who unironically calls someone cringe without even using it properly
                            The proper form of cringe? Pretentious lil bitch aren't ya?
                                Nope your just using the word completely wrong

    On 800,000 DPI
Way too high.
1000 CPI and 55 on siege
This was a one off for sure, ill probably never do something like this ever again
Na, I dont know what it is but i just prefer this Russian sight to the 1.5
    Same 1.5 feels off. This sight I use on most guns
lol
A chunk of the people here think i was in this clip
    Well that sucks for you. Pin a comment saying "that is not me" maybe? Since some people ignore the title.
        oh no it is me in the clip i just wasn't cheating  
my friend was the one who posted it
PC FOR THE WIN
yeah it was for my YT thats why i can understand why ppl say its cheating.
Looks clean to me. Flicks a little left of the enemy, fires a first shot that misses. Super lucky recoil off that first shot moves the crosshair to perfect placement for the second shot. It’s rare but I would wager most people have pulled a shot like this at least once if they’ve played for years.
    This was 100% a once in a life time shot for me
        When I say a shot like this I mean similar, but not necessarily the full 90 degrees flick! Nice clip
            thank you :-)
This ain't me being good it was just a very lucky one off
He’s not good though. Guy can’t even control recoil and it’s a casual match. Plus he’s not using 1.5 on fmg

        :3 get better
Yeah people just don't like people getting one-off kills like I did here
    No hate to u btw it’s just crazy people are this dumb
        yeah but I was pretty crazy with this kill lol
            It's more that you couldn't have possibly known he was there, and then a perfect flick to the forehead as soon as they walk in the room. Textbook aimbot coding 🤷🏻‍♂️
                I saw him for literally a frame the 16:9 is on my yt if you want to look at it
So how would you know something like this or anything that is possible in a game you havnt played? Curious?
    Because I’m a crimson II ranked play sweat in Call of Duty and play with other really good players. I like to think that I have a good eye for cheaters.
        Yea these are just dogass players 💀💀 He's clearly on PC and just got a lucky flick
I mean, the recoil got the kill so the gun wasn’t at head during kill.
Smartest console player
    I'm on PC and I play a lot of Apex. I know cheating when I see it, because Respawn doesn't do shit about it. Anyway it's the off screen flick that gives it away. If that dude showed up on the far side of the screen and he snaps to it, fair play. Snapping to someone you can't even see is the giveaway.
Or your likely dosghit
Smartest console player
It was for a YT short I had to. Also what was it that i didn't want you to notice exactly?
Yeah I would too tbh but it is 100% not cheating
yep
    Haha. You can always tell. That flick is impossible on a controller. I would love it if I had pc. Don’t have the money for it or gaming time while parenting. But it always feels like a cheat when I face people who are on pc.
In case you were wondering, I can confirm that this is indeed the inhuman guy.

        He watches too much Jynxi and thinks controller is superior for a tactical shooter.

I have so many questions.

Are you on PC?

Do you play with a mouse?
- if so, what DPI, in-game sensitivity settings do you play with (incl ADS sensitivity settings)?
- how do you grip your mouse?

My seasonal KD my last season on console was 3.1 as well, so if XIM was that much of an advantage then over the years as XIMs grew in popularity and my lobbies went from controller to emulated MnK I would've noticed an increase in difficulty and dropped rank and/or KD but none of those things happened, my KD only rose each season despite the adapters and I continued to perform just fine. 

People blaming XIM on there ranks are making excuses, as someone who has a 1:1 comparison from both my best friend and from now being a PC player PC players have wayyy better aims and flicks, XIM is at best only slightly better than a pro controller in some regards, but it also has massive disadvantages too in other regards.

>Xim can spin multiple times fully in that time

They can't move any faster than someone on max sensitivty can
                I mean, ubisoft themselves went ahead and said Mnk on console is cheating because it gives an unfair advantage
                    My response to that is two things

1 - Them offering an opinion it's an unfair advantage is just that, it doesn't mean it is a massive advantage 

2 - They actually didn't classify it as cheating, they said when they launched the mouse trap update they did not want to remove the MnK adapaters for those who need it, so they allow you to play matches with it still they just add input latency and increase the latency the higher your skill level is. So mnK adapters are not cheating as per Ubisoft according to there own words, they could ban and sanction players using it if it were

                I don’t think you understand how big of a difference it is
                    I think I do. I played against it for years, 3kd, not a big deal
                        1000 console players with 10k hours played vs 1000 xim players with 10k hours played

Xim wins pretty consistently probably around 75% of the tike
360-noscope the console towards the trashcan
    😎👉 you got it bro!
Fr cringe
Bro gave himself the Peaky Blinders edit 💀
bahahahh  you're right
Oh I didn't know that, but the clip seems way too human like the frantic recoil control upon shooting
    They try to work around mousetrap as much as possible 

xim is cheating btw dont ket anyone tell you otherwise
        Oh no I agree 100% that xim is cheating. Although it's sad that some ximmers still die to my 25 sensitivity self lol
            Gotta keep in mind that hacks have progressed a long way from the 2000s... they do have more AI controlled legit sprays, etc.
                Theyre forgetting something

Any kind of outside software that modifies your in game ability against platers outside of what you would normally do

Is cheating

It doesnt matter how it works if it modifies the game in an unintended way its cheats
        Xim is cheating but the guy in the clip is on PC
        This clip is on PC, Xim has nothing to do with it
    Yeah it uses ai to aim bot
        It rubs the lotion on its skin
Tbf, this would be cheating on console
If you say this shit you do suck but you still tell people to "git gud"
    Oh wow u really exposed me
True so git gud
    I rarely play and even I know that that’s not hax
        Sounds like you don't then
            But I do
                This is childish back and forth, you're cringe
                    What are you a 10 year old who unironically calls someone cringe without even using it properly
                        The proper form of cringe? Pretentious lil bitch aren't ya?
                            Nope your just using the word completely wrong
On 800,000 DPI
Same 1.5 feels off. This sight I use on most guns
Well that sucks for you. Pin a comment saying "that is not me" maybe? Since some people ignore the title.
    oh no it is me in the clip i just wasn't cheating  
my friend was the one who posted it
This was 100% a once in a life time shot for me
    When I say a shot like this I mean similar, but not necessarily the full 90 degrees flick! Nice clip
        thank you :-)
" He’s not good though. Guy can’t even control recoil and it’s a casual match. Plus he’s not using 1.5 on fmg "

    :3 get better
No hate to u btw it’s just crazy people are this dumb
    yeah but I was pretty crazy with this kill lol
        It's more that you couldn't have possibly known he was there, and then a perfect flick to the forehead as soon as they walk in the room. Textbook aimbot coding 🤷🏻‍♂️
            I saw him for literally a frame the 16:9 is on my yt if you want to look at it
Because I’m a crimson II ranked play sweat in Call of Duty and play with other really good players. I like to think that I have a good eye for cheaters.
    Yea these are just dogass players 💀💀 He's clearly on PC and just got a lucky flick
I'm on PC and I play a lot of Apex. I know cheating when I see it, because Respawn doesn't do shit about it. Anyway it's the off screen flick that gives it away. If that dude showed up on the far side of the screen and he snaps to it, fair play. Snapping to someone you can't even see is the giveaway.
Haha. You can always tell. That flick is impossible on a controller. I would love it if I had pc. Don’t have the money for it or gaming time while parenting. But it always feels like a cheat when I face people who are on pc.

Bro this is PC lmfao
    He watches too much Jynxi and thinks controller is superior for a tactical shooter.
    just noticed, why would someone want to play pc r6 though? Makes no sense to me
        why not?

You need to actually have a lower DPI but flick the mouse wider. The larger range of motion lets you have more accuracy due to easier micro-adjustments. People prioritize light mice on smooth surfaces.
No questions on a controller? This would be more wild on controller bc that's way faster than max sensitivity
Yes he is on pc as you can see by the numbers and letters on his screen allocating to keybinds, so that should answer the second question with yes he is using a mouse. I can’t answer what sense he uses but I can tell you his vertical sens is too high for him as you see him pull the gun down too much, and how someone grips their mouse doesn’t really effect much, if it’s a low sens you would preferably want a softer grip to make it easier to fly around your mousepad, and a harder grip for higher sens to get more precision, however the grip usually comes down to preference. And to answer ur last question, you can have different sens for ads and non ads, e.g. a really high non ads and a low ads sens
    the main reason i pulled down so hard is because i was running on just pure adrenaline and also i don't have my glasses so i cant rly see anything but i will reduce it a bit thanks :-)
1000 dpi and 55 horizontal 50 vertical   
I'm right handed so thumb on left of mouse with my mouse buttons, index and middle on left + right mouse buttons and the rest just sit were they want to.
    Thanks my guy!
    Do you use a different multiplier? 1000 with 50 un ads is crazy high
        actually I use 55 on both  
and my standard ads is 50
it really isn't they just don't want to lose that many people which I'm sure is a lot especially in the high ranks queue times would be as awful as they used to be unless they mash together more ranks to fill lobbies which would make newer players want to leave because they are getting stomped more than they already are by smurfs and late ranked joiners.
Well here's the thing about programs

What exactly would you be detecting then? If there's an input that matches "mouse" or "keyboard"?

Okay, hackers can mask that by assigning the mnk features as controller keyboards. Not the hardest thing to do

How about detecting insane flicks? Surely this will know right? If someone were to flick 180 within a millisecond, no way a controller can do that right?

Okay, but then you are going to monitor every second of the player and make sure there's no millisecond "input". So performance drops because you need an algorithm that does that constantly. No one likes it. Or even worse. You detect that some mnk never really do 180s, just a lot of random flicks. Which is also common when you jiggle peek. Does that count too?

Problems pile up without a proper solution unless you really go into the kernels and start monitoring the devices in hardware... Are you then willing to sacrifice your privacy for cheat preventions? Riot did it for valorant, it's the better cheat detector than others... But never perfect
    I don't know why you are being downvoted. It's always been a game of cat and mouse regarding these types of issues. And the thing is that it costs money to solve, but others make money by causing the issue. So it's already one-sided.

What is the incentive for Ubisoft to fix the issue when there is no feasible solution and it costs so much money to actively work on it?

The answer is what we have been seeing.
        That too

It's almost impossible to do anti cheat without losing a chunk of money in the first place. And that honestly creates problems for the company who are trying to actively earn money as revenues...

Well, I don't know why I'm getting down voted either, but at least one person gets it. I'm good with that
Pc does not cross play with xbox? Xbox and playstation can. But neither play with pc players. Thats legit why they are mouse trapping xbox ATM to stop the mnk warriors demolishing controller players.
    Waitt.. what…. so why do all my matches say cross play ranked if it’s only PC… are you kidding me ?  What type of Ronald McDonald BS is that ?
        Crossplay for PC only functions with Luna. So PC&Luna and separately we have xbox&playstation
            Have to be trolling me… Luna?!  Amazon gaming broo? Stop the shenanigans
                Sorry man, not a troll. Straight from ubi
    Also what’s a MNK warrior ?  lol 😂
        MNK warriors are cheaters on console that use XIM. Ubisoft has gone to directly say that MnK on consoles is cheating
Yeah ik him but there’s a lot of people mentioning him using xim but it doesn’t even say if he’s on console
    I don’t think people are saying the guy in the clip specifically is on console, just that people on console using a mouse and keyboard can hit flicks like this which would be pretty much impossible on a controller
    The commenter is on console. Not the person in video. He's saying he plays on console and plays against xim users who are not on console.
Xim is cheating
Not what I asked
    pluh, we're talking about cheating on console because the flick in the video is only possible on mouse and keyboard, also it isn't everyone, this is like the only highly upvoted comment thread talking about cheating on console. The video is only incidentally related to the discussion being had here, its not that complicated.
        I mean the buttons layout are PC, it would show the dpad on console. like this

XIM is 100% cheating. Aiming is ridiculously easy on PC. I can stop playing with my friends for a month and come back nearly as good as I left. On console, it takes me a day or two to get back into the feel of it.
Not false. But to entertain your comment, what exactly are you saying false too?
    It takes me almost half a second to turn around a full 180 

Xim can spin multiple times fully in that time

Any input difference between xjm and pc is negligible in comparison to xim and controller
        >Any input difference between xim and pc is negligible

Nope it feels way worse. I as a former console player who hadn't played with my best friend in 5 years after his service left him disabled and when the XIM adapter went viral and he got it we were finally both able to play console together and games like R6, which was amazing.

However it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, he would complain about how awful it felt in comparison, his aim was much worse than it was on PC, this is why I made a full switch to PC in 2020 so he wasn't forced to use emulated MnK anymore. So now were still gaming but he's able to fully enjoy himself. I appreciate XIM making things more accessible but you're not going to plug it in and become a God, it is not aim bot.

I've been D1 since Dustline, and I remained so up until I left while only using an Elite Series 1 controller. My seasonal KD my last season on console was 3.1 as well, so if XIM was that much of an advantage then over the years as XIMs grew in popularity and my lobbies went from controller to emulated MnK I would've noticed an increase in difficulty and dropped rank and/or KD but none of those things happened, my KD only rose each season despite the adapters and I continued to perform just fine.

not entirely sure tho
>Any input difference between xim and pc is negligible

Nope it feels way worse. I as a former console player who hadn't played with my best friend in 5 years after his service left him disabled and when the XIM adapter went viral and he got it we were finally both able to play console together and games like R6, which was amazing.

However it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, he would complain about how awful it felt in comparison, his aim was much worse than it was on PC, this is why I made a full switch to PC in 2020 so he wasn't forced to use emulated MnK anymore. So now were still gaming but he's able to fully enjoy himself. I appreciate XIM making things more accessible but you're not going to plug it in and become a God, it is not aim bot.

I've been D1 since Dustline, and I remained so up until I left while only using an Elite Series 1 controller. My seasonal KD my last season on console was 3.1 as well, so if XIM was that much of an advantage then over the years as XIMs grew in popularity and my lobbies went from controller to emulated MnK I would've noticed an increase in difficulty and dropped rank and/or KD but none of those things happened, my KD only rose each season despite the adapters and I continued to perform just fine. 

People blaming XIM on there ranks are making excuses, as someone who has a 1:1 comparison from both my best friend and from now being a PC player PC players have wayyy better aims and flicks, XIM is at best only slightly better than a pro controller in some regards, but it also has massive disadvantages too in other regards.

>Xim can spin multiple times fully in that time

They can't move any faster than someone on max sensitivty can
    I mean, ubisoft themselves went ahead and said Mnk on console is cheating because it gives an unfair advantage
        My response to that is two things

1 - Them offering an opinion it's an unfair advantage is just that, it doesn't mean it is a massive advantage 

2 - They actually didn't classify it as cheating, they said when they launched the mouse trap update they did not want to remove the MnK adapaters for those who need it, so they allow you to play matches with it still they just add input latency and increase the latency the higher your skill level is. So mnK adapters are not cheating as per Ubisoft according to there own words, they could ban and sanction players using it if it were
            They actually did classify it as cheating.https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/65UBprZeK2lHJw1qKI8ygM/mouse-and-keyboard-anticheat-feature-on-consoles#:~:text=Mouse%20and%20Keyboard%20on%20Consoles&text=It's%20one%20of%20the%20biggest,address%20this%20form%20of%20cheating. First paragraph, second to last sentence
                Bypassing mouse trap is considered cheating, using mnk adapaters are not if you read the accessibility section in your own link that gives insight into why they're not banning people for it and instead are only adding input latency to "level the playing field"
    I don’t think you understand how big of a difference it is
        I think I do. I played against it for years, 3kd, not a big deal
            1000 console players with 10k hours played vs 1000 xim players with 10k hours played

Xim wins pretty consistently probably around 75% of the tike
Gotta keep in mind that hacks have progressed a long way from the 2000s... they do have more AI controlled legit sprays, etc.
    Theyre forgetting something

Any kind of outside software that modifies your in game ability against platers outside of what you would normally do

Is cheating

It doesnt matter how it works if it modifies the game in an unintended way its cheats
But I do
    This is childish back and forth, you're cringe
        What are you a 10 year old who unironically calls someone cringe without even using it properly
            The proper form of cringe? Pretentious lil bitch aren't ya?
                Nope your just using the word completely wrong
I saw him for literally a frame the 16:9 is on my yt if you want to look at it
