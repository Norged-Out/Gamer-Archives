[[Pulled 3 black ices back to back. What are the odds]]





Go buy a lottery ticket right now
    Naw too late now he used up all luck with them 3 pulls
Calculated

1 in 4,657,463,000

at odds of 1 in 1670 Black Ice
    0.000000356426821% chance, If anyone wanted it as a decimal
        Jesus...
    I doubt black ice is that rare. Are you sure?
        there are A LOT of alpha items, and im sure they have stacked odds.
            Maybe I'm just lucky then
Meanwhile my last 10 purples have been dogshit skins, charms, or awful uniforms.
    You get purples? I only get greens and blues
        You get greens and blues? I only get gray duplicates
            Grays arenâ€™t in the game anymore

                This is like r/whoooosh but worse
That was 4? Or was the loop just to perfect.
    I edited it smooth with one cut, but the 4th was a few packs later. The easy way to tell is the packs remaining value by "open next" between packs.
        Oh okay makes sense.
Thatâ€™s the thing- the odds are pretty high
    The odds arenâ€™t that high, but much higher than they used to be. 3 in a row though is some crazy level of luck.
        Itâ€™s not higher my a lot bc you need to factor in that thereâ€™s like 1670 epic items in the packs and only about 100 of them are black ice, plus they have rotations so some of them arenâ€™t in packs atm. All that together makes the chances much lower than people probably realize, itâ€™s still an incredibly rare thing to see
    The odds of getting a black ice compared to every other epic time in the game are about 1 in 1670, now add the fact that none were duplicates and all 3 were back to back. Someone apparently calculated it and itâ€™s a 1 in 4,657,463,000 chance. That isnâ€™t high at all tfðŸ’€
Been on pc for a year and a half now and I haven't seen one since I started
Under-reaction
Bro wasted heâ€™s lifetime luck in r6. ðŸ’€
50/50 either you did or didnt
Do people like black ice alot?
    Yeee its something to look for in the pile of dogshit Hawaii print skins we get from Alpha packs  
All things aside, its pretty clean and having multiple of them is a quite cohesive loadout
BLACK ICE ON BLACK ICE ON BLACK ICE
respectfully i hate you
Meanwhile I bought 25 alpha packs with 100800 renown, just to get 13 greens, 7 blues, 3 legendaries, and 2 purples (no Black Ice).
to be honest with you, its rare but not very rare as a lot of weapons have black ice now
    It definitely does not have the same hype as it used to. At the beginning we could only have it on operators before season 1 and rarely got any. 

Nowadays black ice weapon skins are more common than gray alpha packs and it just ruining the fun and hype to own them:/
Meanwhile my last 30 packs have been blue and green tier
Is that shroud?
I hate people with RNG like yours. Get in the bin ðŸ˜¤
I bought the 50 pack bundle last week...

I got 3 BlackIce duplicates in a row. Ended with 5 BlackIce duplicates total.
Thatâ€™s wild, I would use that luck on some real money ðŸ¤‘
You mean 4
I once got 2 in a row but never 3.
*Throats the mic* "I fuckin' hate you."
Alphas and no dups is insane
please open your door
Bro can I be you for a day?
The chances seem to be 3/3 sir.
Damn this happened to me, too, and I don't even play the game fr. Just played a little with my friend who was trying to get me into it.
I did this a few weeks ago but mine was with bravo packs so not as impressive as this lol
fuck you lmao iâ€™ve been playing siege since Burnt Horizon and iâ€™ve yet to get a single black ice on ps4 or PC
P90 black ice? I'm jealous
Ugliest skins ever
    Sounds like someone is jealousssss :3
        Sure.... ubisoft make good game, No scam, real original.

Itâ€™s 50/50, it either happens, or it doesnâ€™t
50/50 it either happens or it doesn't
Very rare
At most like 1%
Just watched this man pull more black ice in 15 seconds then my level 90 account will ever see what a day
Crazier odds if it's actually on a gun you use
Was that not four black ices?
Lmfao at first i didnt know it was a real rainbow 6 pack opening. Why the pack looks like a condom? I thought this video was going to be funny at first.
Bro got 4 black ices in one pack opening...
Honest question: why do people like the black ice so much? I have a few, but they don't seem to be as rare as I hear they area. Normally, at least one person running one gun has it in almost every match I play. Personally, I think the Halloween skins are better.
Jesus, congrats lol.
