And God said "let there be ice"
u/Yasin3112 sorry to call you out but I saw your post about getting a duplicate and it reminded me of this ðŸ˜…
    You donâ€˜t understand how much this infuriates meðŸ’€ My Bravo packs this season have been absolutely dogshit all the way through lmao
        Would it be bad to say I got the legendary head gear for Lion and Kali as well... and Lion is one of my Mains as well as Kali for certain maps and sites ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

    Yeah i think it and the f200 look super clean
this happened to me once

but i happen to think black ice looks like shit
    Fair enough I like it but I have some skins that use for operators if I think they match an op skin better

This happened to me a couple months ago & Iâ€™ve been gettin low balled ever sinceâ€¦ ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜­
he think he can get mozzie black ice and NOT disappear tomorrow mysteriously in the afternoonðŸ˜‚
    New account who dis?
Enough, no more black ice for a Year
Wouldnâ€™t say itâ€™s lucky, bravo packs damn near confirm you get black ice because of the no duplicate thing
    I mean still getting 3 black ices back to back is still pretty crazy
    You definitely can get duplicates on bravo packs
        No you canâ€™t lmao
        the point of bravo packs is you get stuff without getting duplicates
Go you.. I have become a meme in my discord as the guy who never gets a black ice..
I got mp5k black ice a few days ago.
Am I the only one to think that black ice is horrible?
    No you aren't but I like it on a lot of guns
I wonder if these are the highest drop black ices because I got these all last season from bravo packs when I just started playing again, or surely like pistols are the highest drop rate.
I got my friend into the game and he immediately got 3 black ice skins while I still don't have one
    Rip
I got my first for Buck, who I never play
The only black ice I got this season wast the pdw and it was my bravo tokenðŸ˜…
Black ice isn't even rare.. played less than a year and i have them all
