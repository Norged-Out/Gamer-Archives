If they challenge you to a 1v1 there awful ninety nine percent of the time
    I’ve only ever had one person actually follow through with it after talking shit. 

I beat the absolute brakes off him, but he wound up being humbled and we ended up being pretty good friends after it.

        I've met a guy that wanted a 1v1 then invited his friend to have a 2v1, it was 5 rounds to win and we ended with them winning 5 to 4. They could not have been prouder. Now I'm old and frail and cannot play siege.
Lol I use to get texts with people telling me what to do & saying I don't pay attention, then end of match they have 1 kill. Like I'm not the best but help me understand. Ignore people bro, just play
    Yep. 1 kill commando's are the worst 😫
1v1 is so useless unless you wanna prove you play cod more or something😭
    I swear people want to 1v1 someone who sucks like bro it's so pointless like what are y proving
        Proving their aim is better. ya hard stuck copper, duh!
        1v1s are pointless, it doesn’t take in to account util or info as much as just “shoot ‘em and play reactionary counters to their operator”. i play well in ranked and such but horrible in 1v1s since i am not used to not being around or playing around utility; it’s such a vital part of the game that 1v1s turn it into cod with map destruction
Post Jynxzi R6 kids
    Because 1v1d never happened before jynxzi…
        Even my grandma knows this is a jynxzi fan let’s stop with the nonsense alrighhhhhhh
R6 tracked him and he's a silver with a 1.2 kd. Where is this ego coming from? 😭
    They are kind of like chihuahuas noisy and aggressive but not very dangerous
    I'm not in a high rank I 1v1 one him and he was garbage that proves he has a massive ego
        Oh nice man, put him in his place lol
            And guess what he said he was top 10 champ in the world
                Like, would the top 10 champ in the world really be harrassing other players? I think not!
What an idiot this guy has made himself look 😆
                    Tbh I don't think the top 10 champ would be playing quick match
                        'Just warming up see' 😆 🤣
                Top 10 in the world an playing quick play lmao.
Let me guess how the game went;
He played Warden & Iana, never picked defuse, and was idle during site prep?
    WAIT U ACTUALLY GOT IT RIGHT LOL
        aint nah f*ckin way he a jynxi kid
    Ah, the TDM meta
Send him my way I’ll send him back to the main lobby in 5 minutes
Some kid was doin this to me yesterday he was silver 4 💀
    if someone ever does that to me i’ll say takes one to know one
Guarantee you he has that stupid broccoli haircut
i always tell them


"you know a 1v1 does nothing to prove anything right?"


because in siege specifically, it really doesnt lol
    🎯
Siege is one of the worst games to have a 1v1 in cuz it's not solely about getting kills. There are much more skills required than good aim. Map knowledge, site setup, communication, etc
I like how thy typed idc at the end. He obviously does care 😂
    Like bro were playing qp not that deep I bet bro only plays ranked
        They usually do, the practice in qp
Mira Khalifaaaa
They always looking for that online validation. SMH 🤦🏻‍♂️
I’m waiting for me to pop up on one of these hahah I message people way to much but it’s during ranked game lol when they are 0-6
This why i stopped playing this game, people be taking it too serious. Especially on pc.
Of course he's in quick but he can't form a message longer than one word
That’s like the tamest thing I’ve ever seen from an r6 player
Lmaoo the exact situation happened to me yesterday over vc
I actually love talking to people like this cuz if I beat them in the 1v1 I can let them know they got beat by a girl and if they beat me I act all awestruck and ask them to tutor me and then after a month or two of talking to them I get hit with the "can I tell you something 🥺🥺🥺🥺" and then I let them know I have a bf. After that we remain friends or they tell me to kys-myself
You can tell he had a losing streak day😂😂😂
Special forces
Love people like this
Why are kids still trying to 1v1 strangers in a “TEAM based shooter” they act like everybody should want to 1v1 them, some people don’t find that fun and just wanna play the game.
People be like this after a doctors curse match lmao
Lmfao I get this stuff all the time. I'm just like chill bro. I got party spammed after killing ppl on the enemy teams. I got rage messaged after I shot a person drone on my team (even though I did not) but apperantly that's why we lost the match. Some ppl in this game have no chill they play like they have a gun to their head.
i’m guessing you haven’t had an xbox very long. that’s the most toxic gaming community.
    Ik it's just hilarious to post this
1V1 MMMMEEEEE BROOOO 
I say no thank you you're probably better than me and I don't take myself THAT seriously ever.
