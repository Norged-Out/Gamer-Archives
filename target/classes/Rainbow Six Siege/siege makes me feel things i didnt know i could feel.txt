[[siege makes me feel things i didnt know i could feel]]





Whenever i see all recruits i dread whats going to happen
    This is strange, usually this happens to the non-recruits that failed to comply.
        Just the typical toxic arseholes
            Follow the law of recruit ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
That‚Äôs vile üòÇ
    siege is pain
        Indeed my friend
Damn recruit gets frags and claymores.
This is, by far, THE slimiest thing I‚Äôve ever seen anyone do to an enemy in this game.
Shooting them, sure, that‚Äôs just playing the game like normal, but making that enemy drop their grenade and end up TKing their teammate?!
That‚Äôs evil
    Nah his own teammate killed him and the rest of his team jumped on the grenade on purpose to kick him from the game just to be trolls.
        I must be blind to not see that. I thought someone in the elevator through the open hatch below shot him.
            I had this happen to me as Glaz on Chalet. A member of a 3 stack told me to throw a grenade down the stairs leading into snowmobile garage. I pulled the pin, and was promptly shot in the head. The grenade dropped, and 3 guys huddled around it. Last thing I heard before receiving a 2 hour unranked ban was "goodbye, buddy" over voice chat.
Classic
I‚Äôve had a similar thing happen with a goyo. They wanted me gone so when I was watching flank they boxed me in and ran into the flames as I tried opening the door.
    That is the exact reason I never play goyo

        How can you tell that from their pfp? Get a life.
            they have that flag in their pfp because they want attention. i dont care if someones trans its just obvious they want attention from people
Martyrdom
The pain üò≠üò≠
Been playing standard more and somehow that‚Äôs worse than a quick match with the tks?
Aint no wayüíÄüíÄüíÄ
I cannot stop crying laughing..
    This gave me sever social anxiety and truama
That‚Äôs what you get for not picking recruit
    Check again
    Blind ahh
     Bro picked recruit
First off, why listen to them? Second, gotta learn how to leave quickly lmao
    Cuz i want to win ü§ë
You got kicked without w warning which means you weren‚Äôt exactly honest with us
    If you tk multiple people in one game you get kicked
        Exactly
            There‚Äôs 2 recruits
                You‚Äôre right and I didn‚Äôt notice that
                    Situational awareness of the average siege player
                        Lol fr
                        Toxicity of the average siege player
                            I'm not even being toxic lol. Being toxic would be calling you names or telling you to harm yourself or uninstall or some other shit. I'm just calling you out because you made a claim that is blatantly wrong when all the information was right in front of your face.
    I had accidentally killed my team while prefiring cuz they ran infront of me
Why does anyone find it enjoyable to do that to people?
    Because people are annoying
I just threw a grenade that got stuck in the air and killed 2 players‚Ä¶ so I got banned
And this is why I can‚Äôt recommend this game to anyone.
    js convinced my friend to buy it ü§ë
        Oof
Ngl this was hilarious.
