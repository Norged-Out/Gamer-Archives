[[What is the origins behind Master Hand]]





In smash 64 the characters are shown as being action figures or toys, the hand is the human who is playing with them.

        "in this essay I will ...."
        Literally making the smash 64 dream come true
    me and my friend used to joke Crazy Hand is the weird cousin your mom made you share your toys with when he was in town
    So that must be the child who's playing the toys all along?!
        The setting of Smash Bros officially is an imaginary world. Master Hand is the one imagining that world.

That's about as much detail as there is. They like to keep it open and mysterious.
            The opening cinematic for the original smash brothers on N64 makes it seem like that the entire “smash bros” world is just some kids imagination as he makes his action figures fight.
                Basically yes. There's no deep "lore" here, it's just set dressing.

Sakurai came up with a quick premise explaining how all these different worlds are able to cross over and left the rest to the gameplay. The stage is set, go fight.
                Interesting imagination that the toys would fight against their owner as the final boss
                    I used to make my toys fight my hand when I was little. Granted, I probably got the idea from Smash, but it worked
                        Me in during 1st grade math class:

Tank vs brontosaurus using my hands as toys.
                    Have you seen the plots 5 year olds come up with as they bash action figures together?
                        I mean not recently, when I was 5 I would pretend I was 2 characters from DBZ and would beat myself up. Guess that’d be similar
        Yes and no. In smash bros 64 (and probably melee) he is a child, but when brawl hit the table, he was a full grown adult who wanted to still play with toys, but Tabuu came and stopped that and tried to make master hand a true adult by trying to destroy all the toys in his imagination
            THAT'S WHY HE'S CALLED TABUU
                Yeah, i know that. Tabuu means many of different kinds of "Hey you can't do this anymore" and this Tabuu means that you can't play with toys anymore
        I believe the smash logo is supposed to be the sun through the bedroom window too with the window panes making the cross through it
    So when master hand is defeated, the human is defeated by their own imagination?
        You could over-psychoanalyze or get all "God is dead" Nietzsche on it but that would kinda defeat the purpose of smushing Cpt. Falcon into Pikachu until they punch each other in the face.
    Holy shit that’s genius, I never realized
    Nah, MJ obviously
    So just like I did as a kid, the fight against the Hands is just a kid punching his toys and being imaginative.
OJs glove
    "If the glove don't fit, you must Smash it"
        holy shit this could have two meanings
It's a person's hand.

No, really, that's its origin.
    I always assumed it was meant to symbolize how players control the characters with their hands,therefore the main boss would be a giant hand.
        in the original the characters are shown to be action figures and the hand is the person playing with them and making them fight
    Isn't it Sakurai's? Or that's what iv heard
    Couldn't it also be inspired by the bible as galeem is made to be a biblically accurate angel?
        The 1999 nintendo party game did not have biblical symbology
        There's not really much to back that up. Sure, Master Hand could be the hand of God, but that only really works under the assumption that it represents a human playing God with their toys.
        To be specific, galeem is based off a seraph.  Lockstin made a great video about this: https://youtu.be/I_8VJsLxBog
Glover on steroids.
    Did you say... Glover?

Now THAT takes me back.
    Glover would make for an interesting smash cameo
        You're not wrong but I don't think Donald Glover is a part of any Nintendo IP

    64 canonically takes place in someone's imagination, with Master Hand being their actual hand. The sequels are less clear.
        You have to go digging into other sources like the Brawl Dojo, Directs, and trophies to get it, but it still holds true even through the sequels. The setting is now called the World of Trophies and it's still an imaginary world (as in, separate from the real world) and the gloves are the nameless people playing with them.
            The trophies and Dojo do still say he's associated with creativity and creation, but in a much vaguer sense than before, and once per game Sakurai likes to do something dramatic with Master Hand that seems to contradict all other lore.
                I wouldn't really call it "lore", more set dressing than anything else. It's a canonically-imaginary world created for the purpose of letting different characters meet up and spar. Everything else that happens just creates more sparring opportunities.
                    Hey, it's not *just* sparring opportunities

Sometimes its opportunities to run through cars on an F-Zero track or break some targets
        I think Melee still follows the idea of Smash 64 closely. It was SSE in Brawl that confused the entire idea.
            Yep, melees opening starts with figurines being thrown into an arena.
https://kirby.fandom.com/wiki/Wham_Bam_Rock

I know Sakurai worked in this game as well.
    Oh fighting giant hands has been a staple game trope for a looong time, if that's what you mean. Wham Bam Rock was definitely not the first to do it.
        Many of Master Hand's moves are noticeably similar to Wham Bam Rock's attacks.

Its not the character's full origin but IMO its pretty save to say that the earlier boss served as inspiration for some of Master Hand's attacks.
Supposedly it's the manifestation of Sakurai himself
smash bros is the embodiment of the playing with action figures from a bunch of different sources.  If you had action figures as a kid you absolutely made them fight your hands once you got tired of slamming them into each other. It's just the natural progression of power scaling
Isnt master hand just a cursor? Like on the character select screen or a computer? I always figured it was just 4th wall breaking
    It's the hand of the kid's playing with the figurines.

God’s hand

I always thought it was the little hand you use to select your character
presumably some sort of master arm.
Big glove idk
ok so basically he is a hand and is the master

It's you
I think that master hand is the hand of tabuu who is the child that used to play with Nintendo toys and make them fight

    It's not Sakurai. Sadly your source is someone who makes shit up on the fly for clickbait.

            bruh how can you look at his yt channel and not immediately see the clickbait titles/thumbnails?

                    One day you'll outgrow it. Just remember that wild, fake supposition about the dark side of Barney or whatever is *much* more likely to get clicks and views on the YouTube algorithm - compared to a video that actually tells you the facts and doesn't try to bait you.
            Because he literally makes shit up. He ignores contrary evidence as much as he uses evidence to make his point.

In one of his fnaf videos he literally called the creator wrong to push his own theory. That's now how good theories are made. You can make anything say anything if you make facts suit your theories instead of your theories to suit the facts.
                I mean, he was bacicly just copying Connerwaffle's theory on Master hand, but added Galeem and Dharkon to the video. So this theory isn't clickbait
            "Evidence" requires facts. There are no facts that definitely point towards Sakurai over anyone else. Truth is that Master Hand is meant to be mysterious and open ended, and doesn't have a canon secret identity. It's meant to be an unsolvable mystery with no answer, very common in fiction.

There's also the fact that Sakurai doesn't like to self-insert. When Terry's trailer was released, the team snuck in the initial "S" as a joke, implying that Sakurai was the one who wrote all the invitations to Smash. As soon as he realized they were going for this, he got embarrassed and insisted that the "S" stood for "Smash" instead. He's far too humble and polite for that, and is clearly not the kind of person who would make a Mary Sue and then reveal it was him the whole time - if for no other reason than the fact that its terrible writing to do that.

Do you think this comment was any more coherent?
            The scientific definition of theory is the exact opposite of that, actually. 

And you can like game theory but that doesn’t make it not clickbait lol

Nintendo’s go to seems to be hand related bosses.
Its a hand
My headcanon will always be Glover.
Sakurai has officially confirmed multiple times that the characters in smash are toys being brought to life by the imagination of someone playing with them. The hand is just the hand of the person doing the playing.
A child (you) is playing with action figures. You are the hand. It's shown in Smash 64s into and outro.

I've seen a bunch of links and answers about the hand and it's Origins in video games, which is great. But as far as I'm aware the origins stretch back way further so here's a decent video on it:

https://youtu.be/3R3cvbLsbAk
It's a hand
Glov
sakurai saw a kid playing with their nintendo action figures and thought “shit imma make a game outta that”
It’s glover from the n64
Masonic in origin
If you mean story, the commonly accepted answer is that Master Hand is the literal hand of a child and the Smash Bros fighters are just that child's toys. If you mean historical origin, I think he comes from one of the first Kirby games?
But what is the demon thing from smash 4 when you beat master hand first and the crazy hand
Technically we are all Master Hand and the reason Nintendo IP characters hold any power is us the customer/consumer.  There is no Mario, Link, Pikachu, DK, Kirby, Link, etc.. without you picking up a controller.  Hence, we are the puppets and also the ones pulling the strings.
