[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl is 15 years old today.]]


Super Smash Bros. Brawl was released 15 years ago today in Japan on January 31st, 2008!

Brawl is really turning into a retro game now, huh


I played Brawl as a casual and knew nothing about the competitive scene. All I knew was how to run around with Sonic and spam F Smash. That being said, it's probably my most played Smash game, and so much of its audiovisual design is permanently etched into my brain, from the Wii Menu startup sound to the beautiful Subspace cutscenes. For that, it will always hold a special place in my heart. 

Looking at it from a competitive lens though, yes it's slow, but I'm constantly shocked at how much tech there is in this game. I think Brawl is a much saucier game than its reputation would suggest, and it makes me feel like something is missing in Smash 4 and especially Ultimate, where the developers remove every single unintended mechanic from the game in favor of developer-sanctioned mechanics that feel much more restrictive by design.
    One of my earliest memories with Smash was playing Brawl on my cousin's Wii as Sonic. I was on a custom stage and kept hitting the spikes, and my number kept going up so I thought it was a good thing, but I was confused since nothing special was happening. I didn't play it that much back then since I didn't own it, and only properly started with Smash 3DS. I remember thinking the Mario characters like Luigi and Wario were funny though (the few characters I did recognize)
Ahh yes. I clearly remember myself and my coworkers at little Caesars trying to decide who gets to get off early that night so we can go pick up our copies. I actually ended up promising to take two extra shifts that week for someone  just so I could leave before close and pick it up at GameStop. Waited in line for hours. Stayed up all night playing, then opened the store the very next morning.

Time flies kids. Before you know it you are 32 and..... Well still play Smash lol.
    I remember going to the midnight release at Gamestop with some friends. I had this weird little MP3 player with a dock so you could use it as a moniter and started unlocking the characters with my feet(just rhythmic tapping and getting killed to get a bunch of matches in) while we played a handful of games until everyone was too tired to move. Just texted my roommate at the time to make him feel as old as this makes me feel(We're like 5 days apart in age).
Always will remember Brawl for its massive soundtrack - at the time it was unprecedented to have *that* much music, including multiple remixes per stage and mixed by an all-star cast of composers. I think everyone can agree that was a major upgrade for the series.
Dojo was the most hype website for its time. Waking up and checking it before school (because it updated in Japan time) was really fun. This was expected to be a superior game to Melee, so the anticipation for each new improvement was huge.
Brawl may have been rough around the edges but Subspace Emissary, the addition of 3rd party characters, the soundtrack, new stages, the gritty and more realistic aesthetic it took make it super memorable. Theres just something about it thats not present in any of the games. Hope we still cherish this game for the longest time because it truly is something special
    classic mode, all starmode, event matches... CO OP EVENT MATCHES, 


online was trash netcode but this game offered a lot
isn't it weird how Japan saw this game release... post january?

it missed the Christmas deadline, had crunch that was insane, and STILL was an incredible success.

this game is weird for it's art style and a vast departure from melees faster tighter gameplay, the core mechanics were god awful and its the worst one to go back to vanilla UNLESS you pick meta knight


but it was the very best smash game for it's content. It provided so much to do, and laid the best for the greatest smash game of all time, Project M


fuck I love this series.
Love Brawl to death, it will always have a special place in my heart. I have so many memories to cherish from that era of Smash/my life. I made friends through Smash, traveled to a few tournaments in my state, met some top players/legends of Smash etc etc. 

15yrs wow. So long ago, yet it doesnâ€™t feel that distant. Happy Birthday SSBB ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽˆ
Never played brawl competitively but I still loved dash attacking around the stage with snake against CPUs
hated this game on release but in retrospect it definitely has its charm, definitely prefer it to the later games
I remember feeling like a pro when I overheard some kids at the 5th grade lunch table talking about how hard Tabuu was, and then explaining to them how to spot dodge lol.  
Brawl will always be my second favorite Smash just from the nostalgia, so many great memories especially with the lead up to the game (and falling for all the fake leaks as any 10 year old would) and dicking around on stage builder all the time.  

  
Because of Brawl I learned how to play online, record gameplay with a DVD recorder, make and edit videos, hack my Wii so I could make better stage builder stuff, and learn basic competitive tech to eventually make someone twice my age in a tournament throw their controller because of chain grabbing them with Falco lol. Good times.
If the game had better gameplay, it'd *easily* be the best Smash game
I loved that game. I was young and played jigglypuff of all things because it was easy and funny to float around and spam rollout in free for alls and steal stocks from an unasuming friend on the other side of the stage. Plus subspace emissary is still the best.
I was just saying Saturday how I wanted to fire up Brawl just to play F-BALL again.
I still watch the subspace emissary cutscenes from time to time. Unlocking them as you progressed through the story was such a treat
Wow.... the Dojo, the Smashed Update. Shit was it really that long ago?
Unironically older than a portion of people in this sub lmao
