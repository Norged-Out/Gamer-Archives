[[master hand and crazy hand overused in classic mode]]


I am currently going through classic mode with all the fighters and master & crazy hand I have seen over 25 times now. I would love to fight dracule, bowser, ganon, marx, metal mario but no I get master and crazy hand. I literally just had to fight them as pichu. Maybe I should have to mewtwo then master hand but no I have to both so many times. I'm tired of seeing them. I hope in the 3.0 update they are seen less. Because this is horrible choices for final bosses in classic mode


Especially because they are obnoxiously hard/tedious to deal with. 
    Not in the matches where it's two v.s master and crazy hand.
        I swear, Incineroar's 9.9 is fucking free.
            Time to finally get that achievement thanks
            I actually found Link to be easier, and one of my mains is Incineroar. Maybe it's just because everything Link has is basically a kill move
            I was so close to doing this with the switch in handheld mode but on the boss fight I thought I was greninja and SD right away. But other than that it was easy
            I tried so many times with that, only to get it with DK. I just wish your partner was Pikachu Libre instead of Greninja
        I've seen that standpoint a few times but upto now I haven't really seen the aid a CPU that died within 2 minutes can provide
Villager Route: Mistake to Underestimate

Boss: Not Marx lol

Well that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll fight Porky at the end of Lucas‚Äôs route-

Porky: Completely Absent lol
    Porky being absent is a good thing because that means he can be a DLC character, right?

^please
        Assuming spirits deconfirm, then he has quite a high chance. HOWEVER, he *might* be in the Absolutely Safe Capsule spirit. So at the moment, we really don‚Äôt know.
            Safe Capsule uses the sprite from before he gets in. From what I hear that sprite is way harder to find than the one where he's inside, so perhaps they did that on purpose

Maybe I'm just hopeful, though.
                Both versions can be seen before he enters it in his battle, and they probably used the uncommon sprite because it doesn‚Äôt have shading.

^cmon ^nintendo ^please ^give ^us ^pig ^boi
                    PLEASE NINTENDO I JUST WANT TO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF THAT ASSHOLE AND MAYBE ALSO MAIN HIM
                        I wanna kick his ass as well as kick ass as him
                        You do know they said they are aiming for a new demographic that never played Smash for Ultimate DLC right?

Porky really isn't getting in

>"With Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, we asked 'How could we reach not only fans of the Super Smash Bros. series, but also those who had never played it before?' If you look at the demographics of the consumers who purchased each of these titles, I ºm not convinced we ºve completely overcome these challenges yet.

                            So the villain of MOTHER that many fans are familiar with thanks to Brawl is too obscure but the guy from an equally obscure JRPG that's not even on Switch is fair game?
                                Porky factually doesn't bring a new demographic/audience. Mother has been crazy represented in Smash while Persona/SMT was not.

So yes, Joker is far more fair game since he actually brings a new audience that hasn't been targeted until Joker's inclusion.

Not even arguing "obscure" but those same fans that got Mother already bought Smash and have been targeted already.

Porky's not happening.
                                    Saving this comment for the near future üêΩ 
                            I think you're looking too far into what is basically PR talk. Just because the majority of the DLC will be aimed at general audiences, doesn't mean all of them are.
                                Labeling it as "it's just PR" blatantly shows your blind hope.

It's not happening, Nintendo is picking the choices.
                I've heard that it's all new franchises/3rd parties, but I'm not 100% on that...
                    That was a misinterpretation. They were trying to say that, since Everyone Is Here, we won't have veteran DLC like Lucas, Mewtwo and Roy in Smash 4.
                    Correct
                        Not correct
            Also, you know how the background changes for certain Final Smashes? Porky could really take advantage of that if he summons...
            I don't care for Porky but even if spirits deconfirm characters that isn't enough to deconfirm him. We have Captain K.Rool spirit.
                and baron k. roolenstine
            I wouldn‚Äôt know because Specknose is IMPOSSIBLE to find
            It's also very important to note that he's the only Brawl boss without a spirit.
            I dont think spirits deconfirm characters. Theres even a Ridley spirit, a k rool spirit, many character spirits.
            [deleted]
                Yeah but that's the thing, they're all varients. So far there hasn't been a single non varient spirit that is also a character, even Pirhana Plant.
                    Lucas and Mewtwo both had trophies in Smash 4, but got in as DLC. No reason to think that a Spirit precludes someone from DLC consideration.
                        I'd agree with you but why wouldn't Pirhana Plant have a spirit? Imo Spirits deconfirm characters but it's not like "oh we can't add geno because we already made him a spirit." and more like "don't add a Pirhana Plant spirit he's already planned for DLC".
                            Considering that Piranha Plant will be the only DLC fighter to get a Palutana's Gidence and the way Sakori has talked about him/her, it seems extremely likely that Pirhana Plant was planed early on but was designated a low priority when it came to developing the game, as a result by the time they started working on him/her there was'nt reely enough time to finish her before launch, so they just make him a a free early adopter bonus and then anyone else who wanted them could pay a small fee to get him. I don't think it's fair to count them when considering that sort of thing.
                    So far there's been no real payed DLC[*](https://nm.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/b8iw30/master_hand_and_crazy_hand_overused_in_classic/ejzmg2p/) released for the game. Even the 2.0 was mostly just bug fixes and a function for the Sprit bored that feels like it was always meant to be in the game, but was'nt finished on time.

Worst case sanario if Sprites were to be an issue they could always rename any spirits that conflict with fucere DLC caricters slightly, or add "(Fighter)" to the end of a DLC caricter's fighter spirit's name. But considering that Fighter Spirits work differently from normal and Saport spirits (as in there a picture you can look at and that's about it as far as I can tell), I could easily see a caricters Fighter & Normal/Saport spirit having the same name cos it's extraordinarily unlikely that that would cose any sort of confusion or problems cos even on the list of spirits page (the only place they could show up in the same place) you can separate spirits by type
            DLC fighters will all be "new to the series" according to Reggie
                Source?
                    "These are going to be characters that are new to the series, just like Joker from Persona 5, characters you would not expect to be in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate." - Reggie, TGA 2018 after Joker reveal
                        Nowhere in that statement did he specify that they were just adding characters from new series, just characters that are new to SMASH.
                            True, but he does say "characters you would not expect to be in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate." Characters from new franchises would be more surprising and unexpected than those from existing franchises
                                Ah yes, we all expected Piranha Plant to join Smash
                He probably just means new as in new playable characters. 
        He‚Äôs the only non Brawl boss to make any form of a reappearance.
        They do deconfirm, plants only spirit is with his dlc. 

I‚Äôm hoping that the 1st fighters pass is the big 3rd parties, and we get another with the first parties (bandana dee, who is absent from DDD‚Äôs final smash hopefully) later 
            "This sample size of 1 proves it"
                I mean, it‚Äôs one of the original Mario enemies. It‚Äôs weird it wasn‚Äôt there as a spirit. But explained with him as a fighter. Porkys exclusion is similar. 
    I was so sure that Father Balder was a boss in Bayonetta's classic mode due to the World of Light menu.
Not to say that the bosses they did add were not good but I feel like they should have added some from the older games like brawl, who wouldn‚Äôt want to fight a harder raquaza as Pok√©mon trainer or one of the other brawl bosses (excluding Ridley for obvious reasons)
    Nah man, even Ridley. Why not? They have Bowser beef up into Giga Bowser, Ridley could do the same.
    To be fair, they'd have to redesign a lot of the movesets if they ported more old bosses. As is, the bosses they brought back were overhauled, and they already designed several new ones.

Plus, as is, the boss design in terms of encounter design is far superior to that of Brawl's.
        Hey I‚Äôm fine with the bosses we have now but it feels like they were hardly used 
Roy: *fights sword-fighters in his Classic routes*

Ganon: *is the only boss with swords*

Roy: *fights Master Hand and Crazy Hand*

Ganon: *shocked Pikachu face*
Completely agree. I was surprised to see them as final bosses (again) as Sheik. Like wtf, I thought Ganon was the obvious choice here.

Not talking about Marx. Hands down my favourite boss of the bunch, yet we only face him as Kirby :/  


Edit: MB, as someone said, we also face him as Rosalina and Inkling. Been a long time since my last classic mode, sorry for saying BS :D
    Also as Rosalina and Inkling
        Shit, can't even remember that, thanks for the reminder \^\^ I'll edit that.
    admit it, that's only cuz hes the easiest boss to beat lmao
        I feel so opposite to y'all here. I've faced master/crazy so much that I know all their moves and the perfect ways to counter them; incredibly easy boss fight.

First time I saw Marx I got fucking *devastated* and it kept up for a while. Even now, that I know his moveset, sometimes I still get hit cause I didn't react in time.
            The thing with Marx is that it's really easy to get hit by him, but a lot of the moves that are easy to get hit by don't actually kill. I've survived to like 200% against him just because I didn't get hit by his mega-laser of death.
            weird hes the only one I reliably beat without taking damage. Maybe just a difference in playstyle? The hands are still a little difficult for me together since it's annoying to track 2 different boss patterns at once.
        Master Hand is much easier. 
            That's probably also because everyone has his patterns deeply ingrained into them from years of fighting it. Also, I dont really entirely agree. Hand is a lot harder to hit than marx is usually, and still has more difficult patterns. 
                Nah Smash Ultimate is my first Smash game, and I've fought Marx before in Kirby. Master Hand is still easier. 
                    Different playstyles I suppose. I regularly 0% Marx, can rarely 0% MH. I just find Marx's attack patterns very easy to read and avoid.
        Even for fun I can't admit that. Like Giga Bowser is a slightly boosted lvl1 CPU even at 9.9 lol  


At least Marx can be somewhat surprising, since we can't see him for shit in this game :')
            You might have a problem with your screen.
            Depends. Marx has really easily avoidable attacks and is almost always close enough for you to hit with aerials and has no melee deterrent like bowser has, since unlike most bosses with easily avoidable attack patterns bowser just attacks like a giant fighter.
    Yeah, every Zelda character should have ganon as the final boss. I did the same thing as Sheik and was so annoyed. They probably just forgot, but it's a really dumb thing to miss. 

Honestly I'd be fine with fights that don't even make sense as long as it's cool. Let pokemon trainer fight ganondorf. Who the hell cares if it "makes sense"? It doesn't "make sense" for him to fight two floating hands anyway, and the other bosses are way more interesting than the hands. 
So many things in this game feel half-baked. I think they were swamped with including every fighter from the series. I hope they polish the entire experience in the next game.
    Yeah, for sure... Clearly "Everyone Is Here" was priority #1, but that is no small task, so as a result all the other content was short changed.
        I hope update 3 brings some modes.
    I've been afraid to say this.  I'm grateful for what we have, but the lack of modes is kind of disappointing.  Luckily, we'll probably get them in updates.
        lol I've been afraid to say it too. I'm a product designer and I love studying game design. There are just basic bad UX design choices in the game.
            Whats wrong with the UX? I've seen videos praising its improvement....there are some GLARING issues, but its leaps and bounds ahead of old smash.
    Absolutely. Classic mode is pretty good, but without an adventure mode it suck having no character stories. 
    The boss list was complete shit

I know people may disagree but... 

Castlevania boss?

Yet no Sonic, Mega Man, etc boss?

Bullshit.
Miis need classic mode too

Brawler gets Giga Bowser, Swordfighter gets Ganon, gunner gets Galleom. Easy.

Also more Marx pls
    I would probably play Classic more often if I could use my mains.
Classic mode is a joke. Everyone was excited with the unique routes, but it just sucks overall. It is repetitive and boring. 

- Routes are mostly uninspired (only enemies with no face? Wow, genius)
- Master/Crazy hand are overused
- Same fucking bonus minigame with same stage layout

I love Smash ultimate to death, but have to admit that it has the worst single player content, hands down. Unless somehow you actually loved the World of Light. 
    Classic Mode is very repetitive. I really liked Smash 4's Classic Mode in comparison to the Classic Modes of the past because it was different every time. In Smash 4 I only played Ganondorf, but I could still get a varied experience due to the way Classic Mode worked.

In Ultimate, I pretty much only play the Inkling, so now I have to go through the same fights every single time since every fighter has a set route. It makes it easier to consistently speedrun, but now I honestly can't enjoy it much except when speedrunning it. Master Fortress imo was better than any of the bosses in this game and it was seriously so exciting and challenging to beat 9.9 for the first time. Classic Mode in this game is just not the same.
        The uniqueness of Smash 4 Classic Mode is a bit of a double-edged sword. It is great to prevent things from getting too stale but it can be a pain if you are trying for that Wii U challenge that requires you to beat Intensity 9.9 without losing a stock.
        Smash 4's classic mode was pretty bad in my opinion because many battles were 6-8 man smash.
    I mean, I did enjoy WoL so maybe I'm biased, but even ignoring it entirely, I don't think Ultimate has worse single-player content 'hands-down' than 64.
        Well, context matters here. For its time, Smash 64 had a fair share of single player fun. Very elaborated bonus on Classic mode, Break the Targets and Board the Platforms, interesting characters unlock. 

It is kind hard to compare content from games that are 20 years apart. Of course that if you put them side by side now, Smash 64 is absolute garbage. But the thing is that we expected big things for Smash Ultimate and it failed to deliver (at least for me), while 64 surprised me when I played on 2001 or so. 
            It's true, context does matter. But if 'context' to you means 'whatever your expectations happen to be', it's all too easy to judge things based on that, rather than on their own merits. WoL isn't Subspace 2.0, it's a massively-expanded Events mode with bosses and the like. And comparing it to past Events modes, it definitely stands up. It doesn't stand up to Subspace because it isn't like Subspace. But if your expectations were Subspace 2.0, and you judge WoL based on that, it'll necessarily fail to deliver because you were expecting something it wasn't.

The same is true for Multi-Man Smash, Spirit Board, and all the other single-player content that's both in the game now and all-but-confirmed to be coming in later patches. What 'surprises you' isn't a fair metric for judging content's merits.
                While I appreciate that it was a length single player content and it had boss battles, it was just not fun. Most battles are just too easy, uninspiring, or just too chaotic due my own equipment. Also there was no specific objectives and scenarios. Some battles are really nice (like defeating the 4 Zelda BotW champions, or Mario RPG crew), but most are just a slog). While it have x200 more battles than event mode, the quality was vastly reduced. At the end, I was just picking the routes with less enemies because I couldn't stand it anymore. 

Also, I'm certainly not the minority here. There is countless complains about WoL being a slog and Smash Ultimate being weak in the Single player aspect. You say that my expectations aren't fair, so neither your enjoyment for it. It is not that it does not meet my expectations, I also simply did not had fun with it. Better now? 

I never expected Subspace 2.0, if that is one of your arguments. I expected a vast amount of single player modes (at least bring what we had so far from other games), a better classic mode, and less shitty WoL. 

Anyway, if you loved WoL, it is pretty much impossible to say that Smash Ultimate lacks a good Single Player mode. There is not much to debate here, but keep in mind that again, a lot of people disliked WoL as well. 
                    To be fair is datamined leaks are anything to go by, we will apparently be getting a stage builder mode and a Home Run Contest mode as of 3.0

also when it comes to WoL, if the game is to easy, simply turn off the skill tree upgrades (don't worry you can turn them back on for free afterwords if you want, and set the difficulty to hard), if it's still to easy, then you can buff the challenge further by using caricter's your bad with, and/or by not using spirits.
                        For what it's worth, the way I kept WoL fresh was by using Hard mode and only ever using a spirit team that made my power level about the same as the enemy (and never targeting the specific weaknesses). I had fun all the way through 100%ing it that way.
                [deleted]
                    Classic mode for 64 isn't randomised. Not only is it a set path like Ultimate, each character has the same path.
        Break the targets was an amazing mode that I really loved in 64. Still remember some of the stages/routes.



 Unrelated, but does it seem like the quick button for main menu in the side bar is only useful when you‚Äôre already at a point that tapping b does the same thing? I would love to use it to get out of training character select, but it doesn‚Äôt show up until you‚Äôre on the screen to pick training mode.
    I gotta disagree here with most of what you said.

The minigame is repetitive and boring, and Master/Crazy Hand does get incredibly overused - these two points I agree with entirely.

But uninspired routes? Eh, I gotta disagree. Most of the routes are quite fun to go through in my opinion - however with around 70 characters it‚Äôs hard not to have a few boring classic mode routes. In fact I think Classic Mode in this entry is probably the best the series has given us so far, as it‚Äôs the first with incentive to have you fight with every character.

World of Light/Spirit Board appears to have a pretty mixed response here, but personally I find this mode to have tons of hours of content to go through. Repetitive? Yes, the World of Light does eventually get repetitive once you reach the Dark World, but it still makes for a fun experience. Miles above Smash 4‚Äôs Singleplayer, and the Adventure Mode in Melee is pretty much just as repetitive.

To be honest, even if you took out World of Light entirely, the classic mode in this game alone is better than what Smash 4 and Smash 64 had.

We are missing Target Smash and Home Run Contest though. That part is a damn shame.
    Yeah but have you tried beating it without getting into the cannon
    I swear that bonus minigame should just be removed, half the time if I didn't really care about the rewards I would just immediately jump into the vortex at the start so I didn't have to play it.
Yeah, I mean it's not like they've been the bosses for everyone since the very first Smash game, smh.
Bayonetta had one of the best routes and I don't know why they didn't do more like that.
tbf them together are only ones that didn't appear in WoL but yeah prob excessive
I was doing this on my YouTube channel and it ended up becoming a joke before the final battle

"wonder who it'll be!? Oh... is the hands... yaaaay"
 Classic mode is a pile of hot garbage that has been shoved out too soon. Almost always master and crazy hand  and always the same bonus stage. 
    Its not that bad lol. Its still fun, and each character has their own unique run. Still alot better than 4's.
        Disagree. Smash 4's Classic Mode is so underrated. It's varied and Master Core is better than any boss in this game imo.
            The fact that so many of the battles were 6-8 man just ruined 4's classic mode for a lot of people.
            It might be technically different each run because it's random but it's still so similar every time. 8 player smash over and over. 

And master core is am awesome boss but it's literally the same each time :(
            Said no one ever
        Their "unique run" gets repetitive with shit boss choices though

Smash 4 at least knew to add some randomness, it gets too much shit honestly

    Weird, that this rule doesn't apply to the Belmonts. Or the Links, Zelda and Sheik. Or Kirby. 
Not in the matches where it's two v.s master and crazy hand.
    I swear, Incineroar's 9.9 is fucking free.
        Time to finally get that achievement thanks
        I actually found Link to be easier, and one of my mains is Incineroar. Maybe it's just because everything Link has is basically a kill move

        I tried so many times with that, only to get it with DK. I just wish your partner was Pikachu Libre instead of Greninja
    I've seen that standpoint a few times but upto now I haven't really seen the aid a CPU that died within 2 minutes can provide
Porky being absent is a good thing because that means he can be a DLC character, right?

^please
    Assuming spirits deconfirm, then he has quite a high chance. HOWEVER, he *might* be in the Absolutely Safe Capsule spirit. So at the moment, we really don‚Äôt know.

                        Considering that Piranha Plant will be the only DLC fighter to get a Palutana's Gidence and the way Sakori has talked about him/her, it seems extremely likely that Pirhana Plant was planed early on but was designated a low priority when it came to developing the game, as a result by the time they started working on him/her there was'nt reely enough time to finish her before launch, so they just make him a a free early adopter bonus and then anyone else who wanted them could pay a small fee to get him. I don't think it's fair to count them when considering that sort of thing.
                So far there's been no real payed DLC[*](https://nm.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/b8iw30/master_hand_and_crazy_hand_overused_in_classic/ejzmg2p/) released for the game. Even the 2.0 was mostly just bug fixes and a function for the Sprit bored that feels like it was always meant to be in the game, but was'nt finished on time.

Worst case sanario if Sprites were to be an issue they could always rename any spirits that conflict with fucere DLC caricters slightly, or add "(Fighter)" to the end of a DLC caricter's fighter spirit's name. But considering that Fighter Spirits work differently from normal and Saport spirits (as in there a picture you can look at and that's about it as far as I can tell), I could easily see a caricters Fighter & Normal/Saport spirit having the same name cos it's extraordinarily unlikely that that would cose any sort of confusion or problems cos even on the list of spirits page (the only place they could show up in the same place) you can separate spirits by type
        DLC fighters will all be "new to the series" according to Reggie
            Source?
                "These are going to be characters that are new to the series, just like Joker from Persona 5, characters you would not expect to be in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate." - Reggie, TGA 2018 after Joker reveal
                    Nowhere in that statement did he specify that they were just adding characters from new series, just characters that are new to SMASH.
                        True, but he does say "characters you would not expect to be in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate." Characters from new franchises would be more surprising and unexpected than those from existing franchises
                            Ah yes, we all expected Piranha Plant to join Smash
            He probably just means new as in new playable characters. 
    He‚Äôs the only non Brawl boss to make any form of a reappearance.
    They do deconfirm, plants only spirit is with his dlc. 

I‚Äôm hoping that the 1st fighters pass is the big 3rd parties, and we get another with the first parties (bandana dee, who is absent from DDD‚Äôs final smash hopefully) later 
        "This sample size of 1 proves it"
            I mean, it‚Äôs one of the original Mario enemies. It‚Äôs weird it wasn‚Äôt there as a spirit. But explained with him as a fighter. Porkys exclusion is similar. 
I was so sure that Father Balder was a boss in Bayonetta's classic mode due to the World of Light menu.
Nah man, even Ridley. Why not? They have Bowser beef up into Giga Bowser, Ridley could do the same.
To be fair, they'd have to redesign a lot of the movesets if they ported more old bosses. As is, the bosses they brought back were overhauled, and they already designed several new ones.

Plus, as is, the boss design in terms of encounter design is far superior to that of Brawl's.
    Hey I‚Äôm fine with the bosses we have now but it feels like they were hardly used 
Also as Rosalina and Inkling
    Shit, can't even remember that, thanks for the reminder \^\^ I'll edit that.
admit it, that's only cuz hes the easiest boss to beat lmao
    I feel so opposite to y'all here. I've faced master/crazy so much that I know all their moves and the perfect ways to counter them; incredibly easy boss fight.

First time I saw Marx I got fucking *devastated* and it kept up for a while. Even now, that I know his moveset, sometimes I still get hit cause I didn't react in time.
        The thing with Marx is that it's really easy to get hit by him, but a lot of the moves that are easy to get hit by don't actually kill. I've survived to like 200% against him just because I didn't get hit by his mega-laser of death.
        weird hes the only one I reliably beat without taking damage. Maybe just a difference in playstyle? The hands are still a little difficult for me together since it's annoying to track 2 different boss patterns at once.
    Master Hand is much easier. 
        That's probably also because everyone has his patterns deeply ingrained into them from years of fighting it. Also, I dont really entirely agree. Hand is a lot harder to hit than marx is usually, and still has more difficult patterns. 
            Nah Smash Ultimate is my first Smash game, and I've fought Marx before in Kirby. Master Hand is still easier. 
                Different playstyles I suppose. I regularly 0% Marx, can rarely 0% MH. I just find Marx's attack patterns very easy to read and avoid.
    Even for fun I can't admit that. Like Giga Bowser is a slightly boosted lvl1 CPU even at 9.9 lol  


At least Marx can be somewhat surprising, since we can't see him for shit in this game :')
        You might have a problem with your screen.
        Depends. Marx has really easily avoidable attacks and is almost always close enough for you to hit with aerials and has no melee deterrent like bowser has, since unlike most bosses with easily avoidable attack patterns bowser just attacks like a giant fighter.
Yeah, every Zelda character should have ganon as the final boss. I did the same thing as Sheik and was so annoyed. They probably just forgot, but it's a really dumb thing to miss. 

Honestly I'd be fine with fights that don't even make sense as long as it's cool. Let pokemon trainer fight ganondorf. Who the hell cares if it "makes sense"? It doesn't "make sense" for him to fight two floating hands anyway, and the other bosses are way more interesting than the hands. 
Yeah, for sure... Clearly "Everyone Is Here" was priority #1, but that is no small task, so as a result all the other content was short changed.
    I hope update 3 brings some modes.
I've been afraid to say this.  I'm grateful for what we have, but the lack of modes is kind of disappointing.  Luckily, we'll probably get them in updates.
    lol I've been afraid to say it too. I'm a product designer and I love studying game design. There are just basic bad UX design choices in the game.
        Whats wrong with the UX? I've seen videos praising its improvement....there are some GLARING issues, but its leaps and bounds ahead of old smash.
Absolutely. Classic mode is pretty good, but without an adventure mode it suck having no character stories. 
The boss list was complete shit

I know people may disagree but... 

Castlevania boss?

Yet no Sonic, Mega Man, etc boss?

Bullshit.
I would probably play Classic more often if I could use my mains.
Classic Mode is very repetitive. I really liked Smash 4's Classic Mode in comparison to the Classic Modes of the past because it was different every time. In Smash 4 I only played Ganondorf, but I could still get a varied experience due to the way Classic Mode worked.

In Ultimate, I pretty much only play the Inkling, so now I have to go through the same fights every single time since every fighter has a set route. It makes it easier to consistently speedrun, but now I honestly can't enjoy it much except when speedrunning it. Master Fortress imo was better than any of the bosses in this game and it was seriously so exciting and challenging to beat 9.9 for the first time. Classic Mode in this game is just not the same.
    The uniqueness of Smash 4 Classic Mode is a bit of a double-edged sword. It is great to prevent things from getting too stale but it can be a pain if you are trying for that Wii U challenge that requires you to beat Intensity 9.9 without losing a stock.
    Smash 4's classic mode was pretty bad in my opinion because many battles were 6-8 man smash.
I mean, I did enjoy WoL so maybe I'm biased, but even ignoring it entirely, I don't think Ultimate has worse single-player content 'hands-down' than 64.
    Well, context matters here. For its time, Smash 64 had a fair share of single player fun. Very elaborated bonus on Classic mode, Break the Targets and Board the Platforms, interesting characters unlock. 

It is kind hard to compare content from games that are 20 years apart. Of course that if you put them side by side now, Smash 64 is absolute garbage. But the thing is that we expected big things for Smash Ultimate and it failed to deliver (at least for me), while 64 surprised me when I played on 2001 or so. 
        It's true, context does matter. But if 'context' to you means 'whatever your expectations happen to be', it's all too easy to judge things based on that, rather than on their own merits. WoL isn't Subspace 2.0, it's a massively-expanded Events mode with bosses and the like. And comparing it to past Events modes, it definitely stands up. It doesn't stand up to Subspace because it isn't like Subspace. But if your expectations were Subspace 2.0, and you judge WoL based on that, it'll necessarily fail to deliver because you were expecting something it wasn't.

The same is true for Multi-Man Smash, Spirit Board, and all the other single-player content that's both in the game now and all-but-confirmed to be coming in later patches. What 'surprises you' isn't a fair metric for judging content's merits.
            While I appreciate that it was a length single player content and it had boss battles, it was just not fun. Most battles are just too easy, uninspiring, or just too chaotic due my own equipment. Also there was no specific objectives and scenarios. Some battles are really nice (like defeating the 4 Zelda BotW champions, or Mario RPG crew), but most are just a slog). While it have x200 more battles than event mode, the quality was vastly reduced. At the end, I was just picking the routes with less enemies because I couldn't stand it anymore. 

Also, I'm certainly not the minority here. There is countless complains about WoL being a slog and Smash Ultimate being weak in the Single player aspect. You say that my expectations aren't fair, so neither your enjoyment for it. It is not that it does not meet my expectations, I also simply did not had fun with it. Better now? 

I never expected Subspace 2.0, if that is one of your arguments. I expected a vast amount of single player modes (at least bring what we had so far from other games), a better classic mode, and less shitty WoL. 

Anyway, if you loved WoL, it is pretty much impossible to say that Smash Ultimate lacks a good Single Player mode. There is not much to debate here, but keep in mind that again, a lot of people disliked WoL as well. 
                To be fair is datamined leaks are anything to go by, we will apparently be getting a stage builder mode and a Home Run Contest mode as of 3.0

also when it comes to WoL, if the game is to easy, simply turn off the skill tree upgrades (don't worry you can turn them back on for free afterwords if you want, and set the difficulty to hard), if it's still to easy, then you can buff the challenge further by using caricter's your bad with, and/or by not using spirits.
                    For what it's worth, the way I kept WoL fresh was by using Hard mode and only ever using a spirit team that made my power level about the same as the enemy (and never targeting the specific weaknesses). I had fun all the way through 100%ing it that way.
            [deleted]
                Classic mode for 64 isn't randomised. Not only is it a set path like Ultimate, each character has the same path.
    Break the targets was an amazing mode that I really loved in 64. Still remember some of the stages/routes.



 Unrelated, but does it seem like the quick button for main menu in the side bar is only useful when you‚Äôre already at a point that tapping b does the same thing? I would love to use it to get out of training character select, but it doesn‚Äôt show up until you‚Äôre on the screen to pick training mode.
I gotta disagree here with most of what you said.

The minigame is repetitive and boring, and Master/Crazy Hand does get incredibly overused - these two points I agree with entirely.

But uninspired routes? Eh, I gotta disagree. Most of the routes are quite fun to go through in my opinion - however with around 70 characters it‚Äôs hard not to have a few boring classic mode routes. In fact I think Classic Mode in this entry is probably the best the series has given us so far, as it‚Äôs the first with incentive to have you fight with every character.

World of Light/Spirit Board appears to have a pretty mixed response here, but personally I find this mode to have tons of hours of content to go through. Repetitive? Yes, the World of Light does eventually get repetitive once you reach the Dark World, but it still makes for a fun experience. Miles above Smash 4‚Äôs Singleplayer, and the Adventure Mode in Melee is pretty much just as repetitive.

To be honest, even if you took out World of Light entirely, the classic mode in this game alone is better than what Smash 4 and Smash 64 had.

We are missing Target Smash and Home Run Contest though. That part is a damn shame.
Yeah but have you tried beating it without getting into the cannon
I swear that bonus minigame should just be removed, half the time if I didn't really care about the rewards I would just immediately jump into the vortex at the start so I didn't have to play it.
Its not that bad lol. Its still fun, and each character has their own unique run. Still alot better than 4's.
    Disagree. Smash 4's Classic Mode is so underrated. It's varied and Master Core is better than any boss in this game imo.
        The fact that so many of the battles were 6-8 man just ruined 4's classic mode for a lot of people.
        It might be technically different each run because it's random but it's still so similar every time. 8 player smash over and over. 

And master core is am awesome boss but it's literally the same each time :(
        Said no one ever
    Their "unique run" gets repetitive with shit boss choices though

Smash 4 at least knew to add some randomness, it gets too much shit honestly
Weird, that this rule doesn't apply to the Belmonts. Or the Links, Zelda and Sheik. Or Kirby. 
I swear, Incineroar's 9.9 is fucking free.
    Time to finally get that achievement thanks
    I actually found Link to be easier, and one of my mains is Incineroar. Maybe it's just because everything Link has is basically a kill move
    I was so close to doing this with the switch in handheld mode but on the boss fight I thought I was greninja and SD right away. But other than that it was easy
    I tried so many times with that, only to get it with DK. I just wish your partner was Pikachu Libre instead of Greninja
I've seen that standpoint a few times but upto now I haven't really seen the aid a CPU that died within 2 minutes can provide
Assuming spirits deconfirm, then he has quite a high chance. HOWEVER, he *might* be in the Absolutely Safe Capsule spirit. So at the moment, we really don‚Äôt know.
    Safe Capsule uses the sprite from before he gets in. From what I hear that sprite is way harder to find than the one where he's inside, so perhaps they did that on purpose

Maybe I'm just hopeful, though.
        Both versions can be seen before he enters it in his battle, and they probably used the uncommon sprite because it doesn‚Äôt have shading.

^cmon ^nintendo ^please ^give ^us ^pig ^boi
            PLEASE NINTENDO I JUST WANT TO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF THAT ASSHOLE AND MAYBE ALSO MAIN HIM
                I wanna kick his ass as well as kick ass as him
                You do know they said they are aiming for a new demographic that never played Smash for Ultimate DLC right?

Porky really isn't getting in

>"With Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, we asked 'How could we reach not only fans of the Super Smash Bros. series, but also those who had never played it before?' If you look at the demographics of the consumers who purchased each of these titles, I ºm not convinced we ºve completely overcome these challenges yet. So our aims are to keep working on them this year, to expand sales of these titles to new consumer demographics, and to keep selling these games for a long time, which is one of our strengths."


https://www.gamesradar.com/heres-what-you-need-to-know-from-nintendos-investor-qanda-new-online-switch-game-and-more/
                    So the villain of MOTHER that many fans are familiar with thanks to Brawl is too obscure but the guy from an equally obscure JRPG that's not even on Switch is fair game?
                        Porky factually doesn't bring a new demographic/audience. Mother has been crazy represented in Smash while Persona/SMT was not.

So yes, Joker is far more fair game since he actually brings a new audience that hasn't been targeted until Joker's inclusion.

Not even arguing "obscure" but those same fans that got Mother already bought Smash and have been targeted already.

Porky's not happening.
                            Saving this comment for the near future üêΩ 
                    I think you're looking too far into what is basically PR talk. Just because the majority of the DLC will be aimed at general audiences, doesn't mean all of them are.
                        Labeling it as "it's just PR" blatantly shows your blind hope.

It's not happening, Nintendo is picking the choices.
        I've heard that it's all new franchises/3rd parties, but I'm not 100% on that...
            That was a misinterpretation. They were trying to say that, since Everyone Is Here, we won't have veteran DLC like Lucas, Mewtwo and Roy in Smash 4.
            Correct
                Not correct
    Also, you know how the background changes for certain Final Smashes? Porky could really take advantage of that if he summons...
    I don't care for Porky but even if spirits deconfirm characters that isn't enough to deconfirm him. We have Captain K.Rool spirit.
        and baron k. roolenstine
    I wouldn‚Äôt know because Specknose is IMPOSSIBLE to find
    It's also very important to note that he's the only Brawl boss without a spirit.
    I dont think spirits deconfirm characters. Theres even a Ridley spirit, a k rool spirit, many character spirits.
    [deleted]
        Yeah but that's the thing, they're all varients. So far there hasn't been a single non varient spirit that is also a character, even Pirhana Plant.
            Lucas and Mewtwo both had trophies in Smash 4, but got in as DLC. No reason to think that a Spirit precludes someone from DLC consideration.
                I'd agree with you but why wouldn't Pirhana Plant have a spirit? Imo Spirits deconfirm characters but it's not like "oh we can't add geno because we already made him a spirit." and more like "don't add a Pirhana Plant spirit he's already planned for DLC".

I actually found Link to be easier, and one of my mains is Incineroar. Maybe it's just because everything Link has is basically a kill move
I was so close to doing this with the switch in handheld mode but on the boss fight I thought I was greninja and SD right away. But other than that it was easy
I tried so many times with that, only to get it with DK. I just wish your partner was Pikachu Libre instead of Greninja
Safe Capsule uses the sprite from before he gets in. From what I hear that sprite is way harder to find than the one where he's inside, so perhaps they did that on purpose

Maybe I'm just hopeful, though.
    Both versions can be seen before he enters it in his battle, and they probably used the uncommon sprite because it doesn‚Äôt have shading.

            You do know they said they are aiming for a new demographic that never played Smash for Ultimate DLC right?

Porky really isn't getting in

>"With Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, we asked 'How could we reach not only fans of the Super Smash Bros. series, but also those who had never played it before?' If you look at the demographics of the consumers who purchased each of these titles, I ºm not convinced we ºve completely overcome these challenges yet. So our aims are to keep working on them this year, to expand sales of these titles to new consumer demographics, and to keep selling these games for a long time, which is one of our strengths."

                So the villain of MOTHER that many fans are familiar with thanks to Brawl is too obscure but the guy from an equally obscure JRPG that's not even on Switch is fair game?
                    Porky factually doesn't bring a new demographic/audience. Mother has been crazy represented in Smash while Persona/SMT was not.

So yes, Joker is far more fair game since he actually brings a new audience that hasn't been targeted until Joker's inclusion.

Not even arguing "obscure" but those same fans that got Mother already bought Smash and have been targeted already.

Porky's not happening.

                I think you're looking too far into what is basically PR talk. Just because the majority of the DLC will be aimed at general audiences, doesn't mean all of them are.
                    Labeling it as "it's just PR" blatantly shows your blind hope.

It's not happening, Nintendo is picking the choices.
    I've heard that it's all new franchises/3rd parties, but I'm not 100% on that...
        That was a misinterpretation. They were trying to say that, since Everyone Is Here, we won't have veteran DLC like Lucas, Mewtwo and Roy in Smash 4.
        Correct
            Not correct
Also, you know how the background changes for certain Final Smashes? Porky could really take advantage of that if he summons...
I don't care for Porky but even if spirits deconfirm characters that isn't enough to deconfirm him. We have Captain K.Rool spirit.
    and baron k. roolenstine
I wouldn‚Äôt know because Specknose is IMPOSSIBLE to find
It's also very important to note that he's the only Brawl boss without a spirit.
I dont think spirits deconfirm characters. Theres even a Ridley spirit, a k rool spirit, many character spirits.
[deleted]
    Yeah but that's the thing, they're all varients. So far there hasn't been a single non varient spirit that is also a character, even Pirhana Plant.
        Lucas and Mewtwo both had trophies in Smash 4, but got in as DLC. No reason to think that a Spirit precludes someone from DLC consideration.
            I'd agree with you but why wouldn't Pirhana Plant have a spirit? Imo Spirits deconfirm characters but it's not like "oh we can't add geno because we already made him a spirit." and more like "don't add a Pirhana Plant spirit he's already planned for DLC".
                Considering that Piranha Plant will be the only DLC fighter to get a Palutana's Gidence and the way Sakori has talked about him/her, it seems extremely likely that Pirhana Plant was planed early on but was designated a low priority when it came to developing the game, as a result by the time they started working on him/her there was'nt reely enough time to finish her before launch, so they just make him a a free early adopter bonus and then anyone else who wanted them could pay a small fee to get him. I don't think it's fair to count them when considering that sort of thing.
        So far there's been no real payed DLC[*](https://nm.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/b8iw30/master_hand_and_crazy_hand_overused_in_classic/ejzmg2p/) released for the game. Even the 2.0 was mostly just bug fixes and a function for the Sprit bored that feels like it was always meant to be in the game, but was'nt finished on time.

Worst case sanario if Sprites were to be an issue they could always rename any spirits that conflict with fucere DLC caricters slightly, or add "(Fighter)" to the end of a DLC caricter's fighter spirit's name. But considering that Fighter Spirits work differently from normal and Saport spirits (as in there a picture you can look at and that's about it as far as I can tell), I could easily see a caricters Fighter & Normal/Saport spirit having the same name cos it's extraordinarily unlikely that that would cose any sort of confusion or problems cos even on the list of spirits page (the only place they could show up in the same place) you can separate spirits by type
DLC fighters will all be "new to the series" according to Reggie
    Source?
        "These are going to be characters that are new to the series, just like Joker from Persona 5, characters you would not expect to be in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate." - Reggie, TGA 2018 after Joker reveal
            Nowhere in that statement did he specify that they were just adding characters from new series, just characters that are new to SMASH.
                True, but he does say "characters you would not expect to be in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate." Characters from new franchises would be more surprising and unexpected than those from existing franchises
                    Ah yes, we all expected Piranha Plant to join Smash
    He probably just means new as in new playable characters. 
"This sample size of 1 proves it"
    I mean, it‚Äôs one of the original Mario enemies. It‚Äôs weird it wasn‚Äôt there as a spirit. But explained with him as a fighter. Porkys exclusion is similar. 
The thing with Marx is that it's really easy to get hit by him, but a lot of the moves that are easy to get hit by don't actually kill. I've survived to like 200% against him just because I didn't get hit by his mega-laser of death.
weird hes the only one I reliably beat without taking damage. Maybe just a difference in playstyle? The hands are still a little difficult for me together since it's annoying to track 2 different boss patterns at once.
That's probably also because everyone has his patterns deeply ingrained into them from years of fighting it. Also, I dont really entirely agree. Hand is a lot harder to hit than marx is usually, and still has more difficult patterns. 
    Nah Smash Ultimate is my first Smash game, and I've fought Marx before in Kirby. Master Hand is still easier. 
        Different playstyles I suppose. I regularly 0% Marx, can rarely 0% MH. I just find Marx's attack patterns very easy to read and avoid.
You might have a problem with your screen.
Depends. Marx has really easily avoidable attacks and is almost always close enough for you to hit with aerials and has no melee deterrent like bowser has, since unlike most bosses with easily avoidable attack patterns bowser just attacks like a giant fighter.
Whats wrong with the UX? I've seen videos praising its improvement....there are some GLARING issues, but its leaps and bounds ahead of old smash.
It's true, context does matter. But if 'context' to you means 'whatever your expectations happen to be', it's all too easy to judge things based on that, rather than on their own merits. WoL isn't Subspace 2.0, it's a massively-expanded Events mode with bosses and the like. And comparing it to past Events modes, it definitely stands up. It doesn't stand up to Subspace because it isn't like Subspace. But if your expectations were Subspace 2.0, and you judge WoL based on that, it'll necessarily fail to deliver because you were expecting something it wasn't.

The same is true for Multi-Man Smash, Spirit Board, and all the other single-player content that's both in the game now and all-but-confirmed to be coming in later patches. What 'surprises you' isn't a fair metric for judging content's merits.
    While I appreciate that it was a length single player content and it had boss battles, it was just not fun. Most battles are just too easy, uninspiring, or just too chaotic due my own equipment. Also there was no specific objectives and scenarios. Some battles are really nice (like defeating the 4 Zelda BotW champions, or Mario RPG crew), but most are just a slog). While it have x200 more battles than event mode, the quality was vastly reduced. At the end, I was just picking the routes with less enemies because I couldn't stand it anymore. 

Also, I'm certainly not the minority here. There is countless complains about WoL being a slog and Smash Ultimate being weak in the Single player aspect. You say that my expectations aren't fair, so neither your enjoyment for it. It is not that it does not meet my expectations, I also simply did not had fun with it. Better now? 

I never expected Subspace 2.0, if that is one of your arguments. I expected a vast amount of single player modes (at least bring what we had so far from other games), a better classic mode, and less shitty WoL. 

Anyway, if you loved WoL, it is pretty much impossible to say that Smash Ultimate lacks a good Single Player mode. There is not much to debate here, but keep in mind that again, a lot of people disliked WoL as well. 
        To be fair is datamined leaks are anything to go by, we will apparently be getting a stage builder mode and a Home Run Contest mode as of 3.0

also when it comes to WoL, if the game is to easy, simply turn off the skill tree upgrades (don't worry you can turn them back on for free afterwords if you want, and set the difficulty to hard), if it's still to easy, then you can buff the challenge further by using caricter's your bad with, and/or by not using spirits.
            For what it's worth, the way I kept WoL fresh was by using Hard mode and only ever using a spirit team that made my power level about the same as the enemy (and never targeting the specific weaknesses). I had fun all the way through 100%ing it that way.
    [deleted]
        Classic mode for 64 isn't randomised. Not only is it a set path like Ultimate, each character has the same path.
The fact that so many of the battles were 6-8 man just ruined 4's classic mode for a lot of people.
It might be technically different each run because it's random but it's still so similar every time. 8 player smash over and over. 

And master core is am awesome boss but it's literally the same each time :(
Said no one ever
