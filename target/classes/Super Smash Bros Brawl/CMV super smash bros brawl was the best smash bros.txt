[[CMV super smash bros brawl was the best smash bros]]


Because it wasn't just one fight after another like melee, or ultimate but also had the side scrolling missions that had a story line. You could play alone, or with friends to defeat the levels, and added a more relaxing part of the game instead of just one match after another. 

Sure the graphics are a little old, and maybe not as many characters are available, but I still think it's the best smash bros game yet.

Also at least the nunchucks fit my hands. If you happen to not have another controller with the switch you have to split the two sides. The individual sides are small(especially if you have large hands) and are not intuitive to use in a pvp match.(also the joystick drift can really fuck a game up. It already fucks up my LOZ: BOTW game)


Edit: this is coming from a person who does not play smash competitively. I play most games for storyline, so having that aspect that allows me a little reprieve from battle after battle is nice.


There's a few primary problems with Brawl that I've seen:

1) Random tripping. Adding randomness into a game can be fun for casual players, but from a competitive standpoint it's a huge detriment.

2) Hitstun canceling explained [here](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Hitstun_canceling). Basically, you can cancel the "stun" caused by an aerial attack very early on in the tumble. This makes combos highly unlikely, something that isn't particularly conducive to offensive play.

3) Unbalanced meta. Meta Knight is clearly the top tier of player, so much so to the point that a large percentage of the top 8 was often Meta Knight mains.

4) Generally slower movement. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's a significant adjustment from the movement of Melee and other Smash games. It's certainly a preference thing but it's a preference that a lot of Smash players didn't like.

>Also at least the nunchucks fit my hands. If you happen to not have another controller with the switch you have to split the two sides. The individual sides are small(especially if you have large hands) and are not intuitive to use in a pvp match.

This is also true if you don't have enough nunchucks, because at that point you have to play using only a Wii remote which was no fun either. Point being that not having the correct equipment for any game makes it unenjoyable.

I will say that the general consensus is that Brawl has an excellent story mode though.
    All of these seem primarily aimed at the competetive scene, though - and I believe it is abundantly clear that Nintendo aims at casual players first and foremost.

I don't think it's fair to rate a game based on how it fares in a competetive setting with professional players - most of the points you make (except for the tripping, that sucks) don't really apply to most players...
        My issue is that previous Smash games managed to be entertaining for both competitive players *and* casual players. I don't see why any of the reasons I mentioned would make the game better for a casual player. If the changes made the game more appealing to casual players I would have a different view. But the consensus among the people I know (which I realize is anecdotal) is that it's not noticeably more fun for casual players.
            >My issue is that previous Smash games managed to be entertaining for both competitive players and casual players.

I do feel like Brawl is much more enjoyable to casual players than melee - and even competetive players for most of the time.

>I don't see why any of the reasons I mentioned would make the game better for a casual player.

They certainly don't, they're just inconsequential for casual players - which, combined with the much better solo play / campaign makes it more enjoyable overall to them, at least that is what I would assume and feel like as a casual player. It set such a precedent that I would actually see the lack of such a great feature as one of the greater flaws of at least the following title. I am not that familiar with Smash ultimate to be fair, so I sadly can't say whether that has anything with a story. 

Point is: all the points you make are valid and understandable, I just believe they don't really apply to most players, whereas the addition of a story-driven campaign does.
                >I do feel like Brawl is much more enjoyable to casual players than melee - and even competitive players for most of the time.

I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that one, because I personally don't enjoy Brawl as much as a casual player. However, I do recognize that this is largely a preference thing.

>They certainly don't, they're just inconsequential for casual players - which, combined with the much better solo play / campaign makes it more enjoyable overall to them, at least that is what I would assume and feel like as a casual player.

I can see how that makes sense. You make a good point that a solo campaign is probably much more important than the small differences in gameplay, so !delta.

    I agree that as a competitive fighting game, Melee is the better option. But if I have three cousins over and we just wanna have a good time, Brawl is just bigger and better than Melee in every way. More characters, smash orbs, assist trophies, more stages. Melee is the better fighting game experience, but Brawl is the better party game experience.
Here’s my concession: brawl has the best solo mode, but that does not make it the best smash bros. Smash bros is meant to be a multiplayer game, so the one smash bros game that has the worst multiplayer experience can’t be the best smash bros game. 

It’s like Cod single player stuff. If a Cod game had a great story mode, but awful multiplayer, Cod fans would complain.

Now brawl might be the best smash bros for you,  because you mostly do story modes, but that doesn’t make it the best for the average person who plays smash.
Melee has a side scrolling mission too. Melee has an active community. Melee has the biggest improvement compared to its prequel. Brawl was not even the most popular smash bros when in was the newest. 

Your only argument is that the mode that had the least to do with smash bros was part of brawl.
    Personally I enjoyed the subspace emissary, strictly for the fact that it wasn't all about pvp. Not everyone enjoys just battle after battle in smash.
        But that is literally the purpose of a brawler. Also you can play ever smash game with purely pve.
            I mean it obviously wasn't the whole purpose in brawl since they did have the subspace emissary mission storyline/gameplay.
                Your view is that you like the part of brawl that is not the essence of smash bros. Therefor it does not count in making it the best game in the series. Only the game with one gamemode you liked most. In every other metric brawl loses.
                    It was literally the best selling SSB until ultimate came out....the ability to unlock characters through a more relaxed gameplay is what I enjoyed the most. Not battle after battle against NPC does so that I could have more playable characters. It gets old a.d there is no story.
        I also enjoyed subspace emissary greatly when playing it 2p with a friend, but it was admittedly repetitive. After a couple of hours grinding it to unlock more characters and trophies, it all starts to feel the same. At its best, SSE was a platforming sidescroller with movement control not at all optimized for platforming sidescroller gameplay. The level design was alright but not revolutionary. And some characters were always a pain to maneuver around it, such as characters with terrible ups like bowser. And the trash mobs of enemies weren't usually strong or resilient enough to make the slow+strong characters feel justified in feeling so slow. 

Like I said, I enjoyed SSE for its good parts (mostly the kickass cinematics), but I don't think it was a strong enough addition to the game to quite compensate for that fact that its PvP wasn't as clean and satisfying as the other entries in the series.
    > Brawl was not even the most popular smash bros when in was the newest.

Huh? Isn't it the second best selling Smash, behind only Ultimate?
        that is more due to the massive amount of wiis. The fanbase and the hardcore gamers disliked it. Mainly because the tripping feature was absolute garbage.
            But my point is it *was* the most popular one at the time. I'm not saying it was the best game, but it was the most popular until Ultimate.
                Since you changed your view from it being the the best game to it not being the best game you should consider awarding a delta.
                    What? I never held the view that it was the best game.
                        >CMV: super smash bros brawl was the best smash bros

?
                            Do you think I'm OP? I'm not OP. I was just challenging the response about Brawl not being the most popular.
                                ok whats your argument
                                    ...that until Ultimate, Brawl had the highest sales of any Smash game, making it the most popular when it was current.
> If you happen to not have another controller with the switch you have to split the two sides.

If you happen to not have another controller with the Wii, you cannot play with 2 players.
    I'd rather not play with 2 people and have a controller that fits my hand and have a playable storyline based part of gameplay than have to split up an already small controller into even smaller parts and have it be totally non ergonomic in my hands.
        No ones forcing you to play if you don’t want to. The Switch gives you the option to play with more people using one controller. The Wii doesn’t.
            You're right they aren't, I was just pointing out my opinion. 🤷‍♀️
No it was the worst, Mets was terrible
    Ok you're focusing on one playable character though lol
        Meta*
            Still only one character tho....
                Meta means the optimal way to play the game... ya goonie... the optimal way to play the game sucked. Funnily enough, Meta the character was OP
                It's about the whole cast, and how the gameplay works at the highest level, due in large part to how the mechanics work. And... yeah, it's pretty bad. The best characters in the game by and large get there by having extremely powerful camping options. 

How bad is this? 

**There isn't a single high or top tier character for whom "move forward" is the optimal line of play in any given neutral situation.** There just isn't! In fact, there were top-level, professional players who made "never move forward" not just a part of their playstyle, but a point of personal pride. 

This is a function of how the game works. Playing aggressively is made more dangerous by tripping, made unrewarding by how floaty the characters are and how weak the hitstun is, and made more punishable by the extremely short shieldstun - unlike in other Smash titles, it is _extremely_ hard to hit an opponent's shield and not immediately get punished, as almost every move in the game was _substantially_ minus on block. And since so many characters have shieldgrabs, and so many top tiers have long chaingrabs... Gets kinda nasty.

The characters that are not effective at playing defensively generally don't see play, because in a game like this, being forced to play offense _sucks_. Even Metaknight, who easily has the best aggro tools in the game, is _substantially better when he spends most of the game running away_. 

When you look at the other top tiers, it actually kinda gets worse. Diddy's optimal neutral setup? Banana in front, banana in hand, shooting peanuts and hoping you try to approach and mess up. Ice Climbers? Desync, spam projectile and zoning tools, hope your opponent gets greedy so you can grab for an instant kill. Snake? Spends the whole game throwing around grenades and mines with constant defensive play. Falco? Laser camping, punish approaches with that free 50% chaingrab. Olimar? Throw pikmin to force an approach, punish with your absurd pivot grab range. Wario? Run away to charge waft. The only non-trash character that really qualifies as "aggressive" is Zero Suit Samus, and _maybe_ Pikachu.

It's _kinda_ just everyone.
SSB is a multiplayer fighting game. Additional bells and whistles should only be considered AFTER considering the state of play of the core game. Melee >> all.
Ohhhhh boy. _Here's_ a fun one.

So, let me throw out some bonafides. I've been playing Smash Bros in one form or another for about 20 years, starting with the original on the N64 and spending a _massive_ amount of time on each title. I got into the competitive scene with Brawl, and organized tournaments in my region for Brawl, Smash 4, and Ultimate. 

_Additionally_, I was big into the Brawl modding community, and was the founder and project lead of "Brawl Minus" for a couple years, as well as avidly following projects like "Brawl Plus" and "Project M". 

Brawl is, for all intents and purposes, the black sheep of the franchise.

From a competitive standpoint, Brawl is a _mess_. The freeform pressure and combos that define Melee, Smash 4, and Smash Ultimate are virtually nonexistent because escape options are incredibly free and hitstun barely exists. To the degree that there are combos, most of them boil down to ridiculous, inescapable, character-specific chaingrabs. This leads to an incredibly campy game, where the best options for many characters involve _never_ approaching, an issue made worse by random tripping - if you try to dash in for a punish, sometimes you just trip and get bodied. It's rough.

The game's balance is also abysmal. Metaknight is, as one rapper famously put it, "[da bess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVFpRQdOuQ0)", to the point where he has multiple matchups that are more or less decided by single moves. _And not always the same move!_ Mach Tornado was the obvious candidate for "Oh wow, who thought this was okay", but Shuttle Loop and Dair are all worth mentioning for invalidating certain high tier matchups (Game and Watch and Ice Climbers, respectively). The question of whether or not to ban Metaknight was a massive base-breaking issue within the community. This may not sound relevant to a casual player, but Metaknight is both broken _and_ incredibly easy to play, because many of his moves are _ridiculously_ hard to deal with. Down Smash is an early kill move that hits on frame 6 and ends really quickly; Neutral B is easy to spam and very hard to stop. If you want your friends to hate you, pick up this character and learn to use a few of his easy busted options. :D

But Metaknight was far from the only oppressive character. Snake, Diddy, Falco, Ice Climbers, and Olimar are all famous for having a handful of just _absurdly_ one-sided matchups, while characters like Bowser, Ganondorf, and Captain Falcon were borderline unplayable. A lot of moves just straight-up _did not work_ - it turns out Ganondorf's forward aerial was supposed to have an autocancel window, but didn't because _it was coded wrong_. There was a lot of silly nonsense like this we found when we started modding the game - a few of Marth's moves _can't_ tipper because the hitboxes were programmed wrong; Snake's model was sized down but his hitboxes weren't (which explains [this insane nonsense](https://aminoapps.com/c/smash/page/blog/explaining-brawl-snakes-u-tilt/rrfe_ux4E8XVQ12arJwDx5KVEJXg8))... Stuff like that. It's a phenomenally _broken_ game.

To get an idea of how much experienced players disliked Brawl, there was a _massive_ modding scene that sprung up around different approaches to "fixing" its many problems.

Meanwhile, on a casual level, you liked Subspace Emissary... But frankly, it feels like Adventure Mode from Melee, with less interesting stuff in it and far more bloat. I suppose it's better than the Adventure Mode in smash ultimate, which removes basically _all_ the interesting stuff and leaves you with nothing _but_ bloat, but given that that's the main tradeoff in order to play a smash game that is slower, less balanced, and more broken than most of the others in the franchise... I dunno, I don't really feel like plugging my Wii in just for that. 

Subspace Emissary is probably the high point for single player in Smash games. If you value that really highly, I won't really be able to convince you that other smash games are better. But if you approach the game from a gameplay and systems perspective, you start to notice that Brawl is _super_ janky in a lot of [weird and often uncomfortable ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSluwQoIfnE).
    No, people are free to continue to vent.

**There isn't a single high or top tier character for whom "move forward" is the optimal line of play in any given neutral situation.** There just isn't! In fact, there were top-level, professional players who made "never move forward" not just a part of their playstyle, but a point of personal pride. 

This is a function of how the game works. Playing aggressively is made more dangerous by tripping, made unrewarding by how floaty the characters are and how weak the hitstun is, and made more punishable by the extremely short shieldstun - unlike in other Smash titles, it is _extremely_ hard to hit an opponent's shield and not immediately get punished, as almost every move in the game was _substantially_ minus on block. And since so many characters have shieldgrabs, and so many top tiers have long chaingrabs... Gets kinda nasty.

The characters that are not effective at playing defensively generally don't see play, because in a game like this, being forced to play offense _sucks_. Even Metaknight, who easily has the best aggro tools in the game, is _substantially better when he spends most of the game running away_. 

When you look at the other top tiers, it actually kinda gets worse. Diddy's optimal neutral setup? Banana in front, banana in hand, shooting peanuts and hoping you try to approach and mess up. Ice Climbers? Desync, spam projectile and zoning tools, hope your opponent gets greedy so you can grab for an instant kill. Snake? Spends the whole game throwing around grenades and mines with constant defensive play. Falco? Laser camping, punish approaches with that free 50% chaingrab. Olimar? Throw pikmin to force an approach, punish with your absurd pivot grab range. Wario? Run away to charge waft. The only non-trash character that really qualifies as "aggressive" is Zero Suit Samus, and _maybe_ Pikachu.

It's _kinda_ just everyone.
>My issue is that previous Smash games managed to be entertaining for both competitive players and casual players.

I do feel like Brawl is much more enjoyable to casual players than melee - and even competetive players for most of the time.

>I don't see why any of the reasons I mentioned would make the game better for a casual player.

They certainly don't, they're just inconsequential for casual players - which, combined with the much better solo play / campaign makes it more enjoyable overall to them, at least that is what I would assume and feel like as a casual player. It set such a precedent that I would actually see the lack of such a great feature as one of the greater flaws of at least the following title. I am not that familiar with Smash ultimate to be fair, so I sadly can't say whether that has anything with a story. 

Point is: all the points you make are valid and understandable, I just believe they don't really apply to most players, whereas the addition of a story-driven campaign does.
    >I do feel like Brawl is much more enjoyable to casual players than melee - and even competitive players for most of the time.

I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that one, because I personally don't enjoy Brawl as much as a casual player. However, I do recognize that this is largely a preference thing.

>They certainly don't, they're just inconsequential for casual players - which, combined with the much better solo play / campaign makes it more enjoyable overall to them, at least that is what I would assume and feel like as a casual player.

I can see how that makes sense. You make a good point that a solo campaign is probably much more important than the small differences in gameplay, so !delta.

I mean it obviously wasn't the whole purpose in brawl since they did have the subspace emissary mission storyline/gameplay.
    Your view is that you like the part of brawl that is not the essence of smash bros. Therefor it does not count in making it the best game in the series. Only the game with one gamemode you liked most. In every other metric brawl loses.
        It was literally the best selling SSB until ultimate came out....the ability to unlock characters through a more relaxed gameplay is what I enjoyed the most. Not battle after battle against NPC does so that I could have more playable characters. It gets old a.d there is no story.
But my point is it *was* the most popular one at the time. I'm not saying it was the best game, but it was the most popular until Ultimate.
    Since you changed your view from it being the the best game to it not being the best game you should consider awarding a delta.
        What? I never held the view that it was the best game.

You're right they aren't, I was just pointing out my opinion. 🤷‍♀️
Still only one character tho....
    Meta means the optimal way to play the game... ya goonie... the optimal way to play the game sucked. Funnily enough, Meta the character was OP
