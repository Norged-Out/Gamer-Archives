[[I love Grand Theft Auto 4]]





This is my favourite GTA and the dlc was good too
    beautiful beautiful Tbogt
        That DLC brought out more of Liberty city that was missing in GTA 4. Liberty city is based on New York and one thing about new york it has legendary night life. TBOGT showed you New york life in 2007-2009.
        TBOGT could've been it's own game outright. That DLC was a masterpiece.
            As a complete package, easily GOAT.
            Wait‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a  dlc ? I only know it as Liberty city stories‚Ä¶. Guess I know what I‚Äôm buying later today. Is that Lost and Damned storyline  a dlc as well?
                Yup! TBOGT and Lost and Damned were both DLCs for GTAIV. I got mine in a trilogy bundle for PS3 years ago
                    Shiieet I remember playing it years ago on my uncle‚Äôs console but then never being able to find a disc version myself. I‚Äôm definitely going to purchase both digitally and replay those bad boys‚Ä¶ Without cheats this time lol
                        Idt I ever even tried to play through without cheats until GTAV. It almost felt unnatural to grind out for weapons and ammo lol
        I though tht shit said lgbqt
            Well I guess Tony is gay in it.
                The Ballad of lGbtq Tiny
                    What is tiny about him?
                        Nothing üòè
                            Your screen name oddly gives me confidence that this is true.
                    HAHAHAH that is exactly how it would've been called if it came out today.
        that pause menu theme holds a special place in my heart. its so beautiful and atmospheric.
        TLAD gang. Fuck Trevor for stomping on his brain lol
            i feel TLAD was the weaker out of the two DLCs, but was still enjoyable.
                Understandable. It is. But its the only reason I got the complete trilogy edition. I always wanted to play a biker gang game and that was the only one that did it right
                    the mechanics were fantastic though! the story was meh to me. i wish some of those mechanics translated to GTAO for their biker update but it wasn‚Äôt stellar. :(
                        Yeah. I appreciate that it even got made in the first place because motorcycle club genre arent that popular in the mainstream. Like the Sons of Anarchy show, nobody talks about it.

And yeah i downloaded gta 5 again just for the biker club dlc. The bikes are nice but they didn't put much effort.
            Yeah fuck him, one of the most bullshit deaths (especially MC death) ever, Gta V is so badly written.
            Trevors the man takes a dump behind a dumpster waiting for a meet with Michael like a boss!
            OMG, what a OST dude! I remember driving trought the streets whit Aerosmith "Lord Of The Thighs" playing at the radio!
        Should I get tbogt before or after I complete the base game? I hear that Tbogt is a better dlc than the base game as itself. There is also TLAD but I think I heard that TBOGT was better, but had less weapons than TLAD. Most importantly tho does TBOGT have better mission structure than the base game, because the base game missions are honestly kinda gets boring with all the track down and follow in vehicle missions. This last question is the deal breaker for me, so if the answer is yes for this one, I‚Äôm totally gonna get TBOGT.

Edit: edit to make the questions more structured I guess.
            Tbogt's alot more memorable. base game for plot, tbogt for literally everything else. And yes, missions...shoot em ups here and there, but is actually quite creative with its structure. 2015 me speaking, memory so could be biased.
            Yes, you are right TBOGT is the best of these 3. GTA IV has indeed a lot of repetitive missions that can be completed just with a drive-by, while TBOGT has more diverse and memorable missions. But if I remember well there are just 25 main story missions, and TLAD has another 25. For the story you should play first GTAIV, as the stories interconnect at some points, then TLAD then TBoGT. But just for the missions' fun and quality TBoGT is the best of them.
            GTA IV FIRST OF COURSE. Or the first cutscene won't make sense at all in TBoGT, also you will not understand the connection the DLC's have to the main story. Because you DO see the main characters from TBoGT and TLAD in IV as Niko, they both cross paths with Niko a few times in IV, I don't wanna spoil the details, just play GTA IV base first.
    It actually had DLC compared to GTA 5 which had non even though it was hinted in some way but instead they went the cheap way and did online. The DLC's also improved the music on the radio stations in GTA 4 by a mile.  It made cruising in your car or riding your motorcycle just a fun thing to do. Both character were great add and their good enough to have their own GTA stand alone even though Luis is the one who I could see in GTA 6 or another GTA game.
        It's good that all radio stations from GTA IV and EFLC are combined together in the later versions of GTA IV. Back then you can only listen songs and radio stations of GTA IV that are not in EFLC and vice versa. Now you can listen to the Vibe in TBoGT and Vice City FM in GTA IV. Hell other radio stations like Vladivostok FM combined songs from GTA IV (Russian music) and TBOGT (House music)
            what versions of GTA 4 can you listen because I have the OG version of the game when it came out.
                Check out PC mods to get back stations that were removed
                The new version in PC, in the Rockstar Launcher. It combines GTA IV with the two DLCs
                    Ah man too bad the PS3 versions dont because I hate the GTA 4 music its the worst in the series and the game is 7th gen console.
            I  consider merging music from both games disadvantage. Simply because  some stations changed their genres
                They combined the genres like in Vladivostok FM it switches from Russian to House
                    Yes, this is  exactly what I said.
        Can you imagine seeing Luis again or working for him? That'd be badass I just really hope they don't kill him off or make him seem like an asshole, at the end of the day he had a good head on his shoulders and was loyal
            If I remember correctly TBGOT didn't have bad ending it had a good or decent ending.  Luis was loyal and never disrepected Gay tony. He stuck up for tony and looked out for him when everyone just wanted a piece of his wealth. Luis can handle himself as good as of the GTA lead characters in the other games.   I can see luis and tony going down to  modern day vice city opening up some of clubs doing what they did before in liberty city.  Or luis goes solo and tony makes an appearance or cameo in the game. He's character that I was surprised was not in GTA V in some way but they bring Johnny to kill him, and packie back but relagate him to henchmen in heists.
        [deleted]
            Prior to earlier this year I was confused by this, now I've actually played TLAD I hate Trevor even more lol
                I still can't fucking believe they did that to Johnny. It's not canon at all for me. Fuck that's not even Trevor for me. He wouldn't do that, even if it's hos early stage crazy persona, which gradually grows imo. Clay and Terry... Jesus. What a huge slap in the face. If they used Niko instead the fans would revolt.
                    Just replayed yesterday actually, and I absolutely agree. Johnny at the end of TLAD would have never let himself and the Lost slip to what they are in 5. He was an actual interesting character, and they just made Trevor out to be the wacky crazy loose cannon.
                        Yup it's a cheap shot. Using shock factor to show how "badass" Trevor is. Imagine if Franklin killed CJ! That's no way to treat your fans imo
        And what does gta 5 do? Take a good character from the dlc, shit in his mouth,  ruin his life and gets him killed by one of the MC, first run I killed Trevor at the end.
    Back when we actually got meaningful DLC. Like almost completely new games
        I was **so so so** disappointed that the GTA 5 dlc never materialized: that city is so vast and detailed, there are a million stories waiting to be told there. Buuuuuuuuut‚Ä¶ nope.
            They‚Äôre huge assholes, but it ended up making them literal billions diverting resources to GTAO. I get it, but it‚Äôs sucks so hard that they‚Äôre rereleasing GTA V again‚Ä¶like why don‚Äôt you add DLC and we‚Äôd buy it in droves before the next GTA VI.

Ah, fuck. I just want GTA VI now, the boat already passed with GTA V DLC
            Same with Red Dead
        The GTAIV trilogy is a work of art.
            It really is. From the writing to the seamless ways they interweave the narratives between the 3 characters. Never noticed Luis or Johnny in my first playthrough really til the DLC
    Me too
    Loved the DLCs for it, sucks that you can't get them on Xbox anymore for some reason, made the mistake of giving my friend the disc for it so now it thinks I don't own em.
    Isn‚Äôt IV the only one that ever had SP DLC?
    What about TLAD
GTAV vs GTAIV

GTAV: cannot go bowling with your cousin

GTAIV: can go bowling with your cousin


the answer is clear
    What about seeing some big American titties?
    GTA IV had way more realistic gun play and AI.
        GTA IV is all about the driving physics.
            I just went to IV after playing though VC and SA, I can't get the cars under control on PC, glad you can just take a cab as well.
                I just tried VC DE, so hard to drive in this game after all those years. Therefore I damaged my cars and died 2 times because they explode ridiculously fast once they're on fire. I'm done until a serious update comes.
                Yeah PC GTA 4 driving is bad with mouse and keyboard because I'm guessing it just engages the throttle fully instead of with a controller it's a pressure sensitive trigger.
    Not if you >!choose the deal ending!<
    The minigames in IV were amazing man
    Gta v has randomized license plates
Gta iv has the same license plate saying liberty city despite the fact that the game is set in 2 states 
Gta v is better because of better license plates
It has the best storyline and characters and I love this dark and gloomy city it gives the game its own feel and atmosphere, it's definitely my favorite gta game
4 is by far my favorite in the series
Started it again this week, I‚Äôve not played it since it came out. Pretty much feels like a new game to me. Loving it all.
    same except got it on pc again few weeks ago
same, this game is my favourite out of all gta games
Nothing is better than 4. Little Jacob is life.
    Watch out for bad man!!
        *Well...*

üò•
    All of the characters in IV are so endearing. Special mention too to Dwayne and Brucie
        I always save dwayne.
            You‚Äôve got no heart if you even consider doing otherwise. Plus scoring all of Playboy‚Äôs stuff is an added bonus tbh
                Lol a super sweet apartment is definitely a bonus
    seen
    Agreed. I would say this applies to all the characters. Every single person had a distinct personality.
#GTA4isbetterthanGTA5
    Sounds like a subreddit lmao
        /r/gta4circlejerk
            Brilliant
    Feels good to read something so true.
    GTA V killed my dog and burnt my house
        This sub chooses a new gta game to suck off every month and all the other gta games are awful compared to it
    Tell that to GTA 4's driving
        I unironically love GTA 4's driving.
        it was great and satisfying gta 5's too soft and repetitive its like driving the same car over nd over again
            But look at games that base their whole game around driving like Forza horizon. In horizon the driving feels decently realistic yet it isnt like driving on ice. I'd say it's alot more like gta5 driving
                Horizon is arcady unless you mess withe settings , gta 4‚Äôs handling model had more of a simulation feel to it and it was very satisfying and rewarding, gta 5¬¥s is not bad by any means but just not as rewarding as the 4th‚Äôs
                Gta 4 is not like that either. It only feels like the roads are ice if you try applying GTA SA/5 style driving to it.

If you actually drive carefully and like you would in real life, it's a lot more manageable. Of course you're gonna slide if you're driving 100kmh and turn into a sharp corner with your handbreak
                    Exactly! It looks slow, so people think they can just turn around while driving 100km/h.
                    What an awful take, literally who plays gta without driving like a maniac?
                        Me, you don't need to always press the gas, you can just let it go when you wanna take turns.
                        You don't need to drive like a normal citizen, literally just slow down before corners.
                    > If you actually drive carefully and like you would in real life, it's a lot more manageable.

but in real life you also dont drive slow and i can instantly see that in gta 4 the car wheels had oil into them and the ground is ice
                        > but in real life you also dont drive slow

Wtf are you smoking? You clearly never driven a car lmao. Show me your car that slides through corners at 50+ in NYC traffic.
                The tire spin , suspension travel , damage model were greater
        I still prefer IVs driving physics, until they break
        4 had more realistic driving
            Realistic isn't better.
                tell that to RDR2 & most likely GTA VI (if that's ever confirmed lol)
                    Tbf the more realistic parts of rdr2 are either amazing or make the game wayyy more boring, no in between
                In your opinion
            Realistic? Just say you never driven a car before.
                Yes, it's the most realistic driving in the entire GTA series so it's a valid point. Actually it's more realistic than even many actual racing games.

I'm not a GTA 4 fanboy either, it just sounds like you never played 4 or you're the one who has never driven.
                    Driving on buttery roads is now realistic now? You IV fanboys are funny.
                        Someone was bad at driving in IV. Git gud.
                            Ah yes, the classic "If you don't like it you're just bad at it".
                Lol I suppose I walked to work this morning did I? It‚Äôs definitely more realistic than the driving in gta v anyway
                    What does V have to do with this? Are IV fanboys so insecure that V is more popular that they bring up when no one else did?
                        Do you want to read back through the comments and see what we‚Äôre talking about here. It‚Äôs literally comparing the two
                > Realistic? Just say you never driven a car before.

Lmao what a hill do to die mate. A really terrible one indeed.
                    Oh yes because I am the one who brought it up first.
                You never driven a car before
                    You guys must crashing all the timeS
                        Yes because I love the crash physics and the deformation system in the game is insane
                            When you roll a cop car over and the siren gets all wonky
                                Love that
        That‚Äôs the only downfall of this game, playing it now and the amount of times I spin out is ridiculous
            Stop overcorrecting
                Fair point, I had to learn quickly it‚Äôs light taps and steers, but it‚Äôs not Forza level handling or control it feels like a badly implemented realism
            Lotta people in this comment section are saying they like it so I'm surprised I didn't get mass downvoted lol. I feel like it's because the cars can lose traction much too easily just by steering. Most racing games and games with good feeling driving don't allow you to spin out by steering especially in a passenger sedan. A Lambo is a different story though it makes sense for fast things to spin out when accelerating
                The overall driving just "feels" slow. So when driving full speed, it doesn't feel like 200km/h and people think they can make a sharp turn.
I love the driving in IV, 5 was too arcadey for me (controlling the car mid-air etc.)
                I agree, the sports cars it actually did feel realistic in a way because it was you tryna harness all the horsepower into a straight shot. The regular 4 door sedan doing that shit tho is bonkers, and even worse is the Porsche, one of the nicest handling cars is like driving on ice.

This game seriously excelled the series by eons, but the driving was definitely an experiment in realism gone wrong. I definitely enjoy GTA V driving the best
                    The driving is one of the best aspects of IV. It has weight. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it takes some skill to master. You can‚Äôt say that about V‚Äôs driving. 

And I like V‚Äôs too but it gets boring when every car controls basically the exact same. At least in IV, I can tell the difference between a sports car and a van, because the game does a far better job of simulating the difference in weight.
        In my personal experience, 4's driving doesn't stand a chance against 5's
            you misspelled opinion
                Did I insult his opinion? I just presented my own.
        I would assume this take comes from not being good at driving in 4. It‚Äôs very possible to drive great In 4 you just have to actually pay attention and use the handbrake.
            I use the handbrake in 5 alot. And also you can't really tell me I'm not good at driving in games. I play a ton of Forza and other racing games. I'm used to all sorts of driving mechanics in games. That said you can't blame skill for people not liking something when it's such a 50/50 issue. Half of people seem to like it and defend it and the other half agree with me that it feels very slippery. When you drive your car for real do you spin out like that from turning the wheel hard? Not really. Unless we are supposed to believe every passenger car has rear wheel drive and 300hp under the hood
            I have no problems adapting to IV's driving after playing the 3d games as well as V, but it's definitely not my favorite. They went way too far trying to make it "realistic".
    Insecure much.
Had the best melee combat system of all games‚Ä¶ I have no idea how V style melee combat could pass QC - sprint&punch 1 hit insta kill is the most boring shit ever.
    Yep, I‚Äôd spend hours as a teen just punching a bunch of taxis and getting chased by 30 angry cab drivers then taking them all out with a baseball bat, I love the euphoria physics engine, WAAAAAAY better and immersive than the shit physics engine they used in gta v.
    The insta killing is annoying. I liked how you could have legitimate fights in GTA 4.
        I‚Äôve been revisiting IV on my XSX now that it runs at 60fps on console (and quick resume is a nice bonus)- I‚Äôve had so much fun just dicking around in this game. Punched a taxi in front of a cop car to make the taxi driver get out and start a fight with me, letting him land a couple blows. The cops got out of their car and arrested him, put him in the back of the cop car, then I stole the cop car and drove around doing stunts with that taxi driver in the backseat. I also started a fist fight with someone on the street (dressed as a gang banger) then they pulled out a baseball bat and beat the shit out of me. Don‚Äôt really remember having that much fun messing around with pedestrians in V which was a bummer considering I imagined V would be a major upgrade in all departments, not just some
            It‚Äôs great isn‚Äôt it? GTA IV really did an excellent job giving you the resources to really do whatever you wanted. I might have to revisit it this weekend!
    I'd say Vice City Stories has my favourite melee combat of them all, still the only GTA that allowed you to grapple and snap necks. None of the GTAs could compare to The Warriors though.
    At least RDR2 was a return to form
    Yup. Combat is 5‚Äôs biggest flaw. It‚Äôs so linear or monotonous, no variety whatsoever
The best GTA ever made, in my humble opinion. I played all the games in the series, and none left a mark so deep in me as GTA4 did. The only game i would consider better is Red Dead Redemption 2.
Best game in the series. The storyline was so good and absolutely EVERY character was likable. I also loved how dark it got towards the end. Truly a masterpiece.
[removed]
    Yeah the pc version sucks, I am using fusi√≥n fix and the Vulkan mod and it runs better but this game screams for good and well done remaster
        Is there a patch out that gets rid of that god awful Games For Windows Live DRM?
            There actually was a mod at some point, I believe. I know it's possible to remove it.
            [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GTAIV/comments/kwcvs4/gta_iv_physical_copy/gj3kajn/)
        Good and well done? After the trilogy fiasco, I have little faith that will ever happen.
    Runs pretty decently on Xbox
    I am playing it on a Xbox series s and it still has frame drops in heavy traffic. Draw distance is pretty weak as well as it blurs everything in the background, but the background is like 200 ft away. It‚Äôs still a good game but don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth you switching to Xbox on.
    I had to hard reset my whole pc and after that the game was no longer stuttering. Well there‚Äôs a solution for you
Yeah I‚Äôm doing a play through rn and honestly I forgot how good the driving feels, I definitely think the story is way better than 5.
    The 5 story was difficult to follow and the stakes didn't seem very high. We all expected Franklin to be the new CJ, but it's clear he's the third wheel in the drama of the story. With character switching, it felt hard to connect with anyone's story as they were interconnected anyhow
        Yeah the character switching was a awesome feature, especially when randomly switching to Trevor and seeing some crazy stuff, but it really did hurt my ability to really get a real connection with any one of them. I do gotta say though that seeing Los Santos get a glow up blew me away when I first played.
            The character switch was pointless imo, and underutilized. All three characters play exactly the same apart from their special abilities so it ended up being nothing more than a gimmick. 

And not being able to switch during hang outs was laughable.
                It was a plot device how is it a gimmick? They're not different power rangers they're all normal humans lol what were you expecting exactly?
                    I was expecting to be able to switch between them when you had a wanted level so you could actually have fun using the mechanic against the cops in free roam.
                I hated it and consequently never bothered finishing the game.
    I like 4 a lot but the driving feels so bad. It's what I imagine driving was like in 1950s.
        Idk I just like it, five is so perfect with the driving that it really feels like driving toy cars but for me in 4 it feels like it‚Äôs got some weight behind the wheel. I know a lot of people hate it and I completely understand lol.
        It feels bad because you don‚Äôt have the skills required. I was the same when I first played IV. Crashed into everything, spun out etc.
            No I was good at driving. It still feels pretty bad
                Not good enough
        I'm right there with ya the driving mechanics are too complicated for a non racing focused game.
            Not everyone likes the boring Mario Karts from GTA V‚Ä¶
    Why the hell do people always have to compare IV to V in this subreddit? Why not compare it to some other GTA games also?
        Because they‚Äôre the only two in the HD universe?
            I guess you can compare the gameplay but there's no excuse for comparing the story.
        Because V is after IV genius.
Over the last few months I have replayed all the GTA games from 3 and up to completion 

And 4 is by far the best in literally every category, MAYBE the map is debatable compared to V in terms of geography

But IV is the most immersive and interactive. 

Rockstar Games was truly at its peak here, and it‚Äôs amazing to me how ahead of its time this game is. 

On release I remember it being the first time I was like ‚ÄúHoly shit, this is truly next gen‚Äù. It‚Äôs such a monumental step up from San Andreas in terms of gameplay and storytelling. 

The story is the deepest and most interesting to me as well. I‚Äôve heard people say that it‚Äôs boring, and I can sort of see why as it isn‚Äôt as whacky or ‚Äú‚Äùfun‚Äù‚Äù as the other games, and it‚Äôs kind of like a game equivalent of a high production drama epic, ala The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, etc and you have to be the sort of person who really enjoys that kind of media to really like GTA IV‚Äôs storytelling. 

Absolutely fucking timeless game.
    It‚Äôs like the red dead 2 of gta games. If that makes sense. 

Sure the graphics aren‚Äôt amazing today, but everything else is still top tier. 

Let‚Äôs face it, the only open world drive around stealing cars and killing people simulator with physics that even come close, is gtav. Gta 4 has the best roadkill physics of any open world game to this day. 

No wonder it ran at 20-30fps on consoles, honestly I‚Äôm amazed they even got it working at all considering it‚Äôs still got the most complex physics of any open world drive on the sidewalk game.
The best story and physics ever, all it was missing was the ability to customise vehicles, besides that, still my favourite GTA.
    The only bad thing about the physics was driving. Yes it was realistic but it should also have been fun.
        They should've fixed the slipperiness instead of completely deleting the driving physics in V.
        Yeah the community is kind of half-half with the car physics of gta 4, I personally enjoyed it as once you figured out each cars different weight and body roll you could pretty much lose people quite easily in GTA 4 free mode online where as GTA Online, any 12 year old with a supercar can just quickly catch up no matter how good you drive based on the car physics being so arcadey.
It‚Äôs absolutely the best one
    100%
Best GTA in the series
I thought it was the most fun of all of them to rampage with friends. The classics have their place for that, but the detail and feel in this one just blew them away.
Bro, literally just booted it up a few nights ago for the first time in years. Been playing it ever since. So fucking good. The engine, the story, liberty City in its prime. Niko is the best!
Best game ever in the whole series. 10/10 will not answer my phone and go bowling with my cousin.
Is it bad for me to say that even after all the shit storm of the definitive edition, I‚Äôm really hoping we get a remaster of this
Best menu theme ever in the history of video games
It's my favorite gta game and it's also legendary!
Just got this recently on PC and replaying it in 60fps 4k on my ultrawide + controller = chefs kiss
    Nice! Though why torture yourself with a controller?
        haha to me its more natural as a long time console player
 IV multiplayer was amazing. It was barebones as hell and that's what made it great. No constant car releases ruining racing and no dumb op shit ruining free roam. The Car v Car PVP in GTA was amazing.
    GTA race. You die? Respawn on a moped.
CHEESY VAGINA
GTA IV is definitely one of the most atmospheric games. The weather effects and overall aesthetic is really well done.
It's the most immersive, realistic GTA title in the series. This game still holds up and can beat today's open world games standarts. Totally a masterpiece but its technical problems when its released caused not getting too much praise from the fans which is kinda sad. Its my favorite in the PS3 era. Definitely better than the 5 and at a level that can compete with the previous games of the series VC and SA in terms of story and characters .Purely genius.
    I loved the multiplayer as well, I enjoyed it way more than 5's. 'Cannoball' Races across the city with randoms online were some of the most fun matches I've had in an online game.
        Agreed. It was a simple and fun multiplayer. Especially races and open world airport fights.
    Do you mean at release or today? This game gets a TON of praise today. I'd go as far as to say it's overrated.
        At the release of course. That's why i said 'when its released' in the comment. A lot of people says its was a great game and better than 5 nowadays.
Only played it for the first time this past year. Definitely my favorite now, even though 3/Vice City/San Andreas hold major nostalgia for me.
What platform are you playing this on? Have you added mods? Looks really good.
    Pc, this is vanilla, only fusi√≥n fix
    Looks good because it's 4k + sunsets are always nice. Though there're plenty of vanilla friendly mods like [CleanIV](https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24247)
Remaster pls.
Great game.
In a lot fo ways better then 5. Surprisingly physics are one of those ways. Other things I'm glad are gone (COUSIN LET'S GO DRINKING)

My main complaint is that the game runs like absolute shit.
Didn't enjoy it as a kid but as I got older, I definitely appreciated the game more.
The last great GTA
My favourite game of all time.
Underrated game.
I loved how each DLC kinda had its own tint on the game. TBoGT was bright and filled with colors majority of the time whereas TLaD was almost always gritty.
The euphoria engine was so, so good.
The storyline with the diamonds is so good that it makes me melt in my jeans
I like it a lot too. I think it was the grittiest GTA. I liked the main characters and gunplay a lot. But I wish the cars drove better, especially on KB&M.
I just love how HQ this photo is
    I will tell you a secret. I'm playing the game at 8k, so this screenshots is basically an 8k picture lol
What‚Äôs with this subreddit and obsessing over GTA IV lately
    The GTA community in general obsesses over this game constantly. I don't mind it since IV is amazing, but IV fanboys are absolute cancer. They're so hypocritical it's hilarious.
        I think it‚Äôs a good game but I‚Äôve noticed a lot more posts on it lately like everyone is jumping on a IV love bandwagon
    Circlejerking for internet points
Only 53 pigeons left. And Itll be my first 100% GTA
Also can rockstar remaster red dead redemption 1
This is my favourite out of all of them.
you haven't seen it yet valdivostok FM
GTA4 was the first game of the series that I actually got bored of playing. I don't mean to say it's bad though, it's actually an amazing game and potentially one of the best in the series. It certainly has the best city imo. I think it was the realistic direction they took with it and just didn't appeal to me. I'm the same with GTA5; amazing game but I just can't find enjoyment in it. I think my love for GTA is still with the original trilogy.
Me too, I play it whenever I can
I wish I could run 4 like that lol. More like 720p lowest settings for me.
Amazing game
And gta 4 multiplayer too
This game is really something else
It‚Äôs glorious playing it in 60fps on Xbox Series S/X

GTA V as good as it is, was a downgrade in some aspects
Great one
4 is my personal favourite too. Something so real and gritty about the whole storyline and the setting of Liberty city. The physics engine was phenomenal, the most realistic GTA to date imo.
ELECTRO CHOC
GTA 4 on PS3 has much better graphics and framerate than GTA 3 on PS5
The Pok√©mon cycle has begun.
Been playing this recently. IMO the graphics are truly perfect as they are. It's great to be playing in a cold and depressing atmosphere. Very relatable to us here on the east coast. The type of late fall / early winter misery is extremely well portrayed.
IV was optimized poorly for PC. I've been playing it from Steam purchase and they didn't do a good job on the PC version. Lots of stutters and gfx glitches on a PC that can more then handle today's AAA games. 

In general the graphics and character models have aged a bit and so have the shooting and driving mechanics but the story and map are still very good.
    I think GTA V shooting and driving aged a bit and they feel like they came from 1994, but of course different people have different tastes.
This game makes me want to visit New York for real. Would love to get the opportunity some day! Nice shot.
Currently playing right now and just bought it yesterday while it was on sale for the holidays!
    Yeah man I was so dissapointed with the trilogy remaster that I had to come back to this
        I‚Äôve rarely had any problems with the trilogy in my opinion except for like 2 bugs but after that everything else was fine for me
            For me its not about the bugs, but about the quality presentation
                Well that too I‚Äôve really never let bother myself either
If they remaster this they better keep the colour palette, the feel of the city and driving.
Same about to play it
GTA IV seems to be gaining lots more appreciation over time. That‚Äôs what quality and hindsight does.
Is it worth it in 2021? I I'm on Xbox series S and GTA 4 it's backwards compatible but does it looks blurry or is it improved?
This doesn't need any remake or remaster. I'm sorry
we need it remastered the right way no funky cartoonish stuff just raw cynical scene just as it was meant to be
Cue the GTA4 fanboys talking about how much better this game is compared to 5 lol. Other than that GTA4 is a pretty good game yea
Ok
    Having a bad day pal?
        Iam happy that u r able to play this  game. :)
couldnt finish this game because of the optimization, but i absolutely fell in love with the atmosphere and the story. Miles ahead of V for sure
I still think part of GTA IV storyline doesn't really work well, because Rockstar Games were caught in the middle between absolute freedom (the 3D era) and the "forced" cinematic storytelling (GTA V).

Take the "Michelle" arc: after you meet her one time, you can just ignore her, dump her on your first date (if you instead choose to help Roman in "bleed out"), forget her for hours (there are like 10 or 15 missions before she reappears), and yet the game still plays out as if she was the most important things ever for niko.

GTA V, as flawed and more superficial as it is, "forces" you to spend some times with the other main characters and cast (somebody says yoga?)... and while this restrict the player's freedom, at least every twist and turn of the story feel more consistent to the player's action.
    I agree that the game could have made Michelle a bigger part of the story (and I wish she was) but this is no different than Michael and Franklin acting like father and son after knowing each other for 5 minutes. It throws them together by pure coincidence too so it feels contrived. 

But there isn‚Äôt really an answer to make the plot and gameplay line up in a GTA game. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to go out and slaughter pedestrians either, but you can do it. And GTA 5‚Äôs half assed attempts at making it seem like it makes sense, such as having Michael tell his therapist that he is a psycho one minute and a saint the next, are pathetic. Better to just accept the situation, and ignore it, because there is no fix.
GTA 4 while not my favorite TBOGT is, so much life in the gloomy city of Liberty City wish Luis got another run.
Only hour in this game where the lighting doesn't look like abseloute dogshit
[deleted]
    Who wants to fight your opinion?
Eh, i never liked it. Different shades of soulless brown and yellow is all I remember from that game. And bowling.
    So far I like the game and I don‚Äôt mind the dark tone BUT the mission structures kill the fun because half of them so far are just tracking missions where you have to follow some random dude to kill him until he crashes or until you kill him, or your following a train or chopper or whatever.
        Yeah, that's one thing IV lacked. I think the story more than makes up for it though. If you plan on playing TLAD and TBOGT, they massively improve on the mission structure. The missions are so much more fun in the DLCs.
Best GTA
Nah
Best GTA is SA then 4 then 5
the only problem i have with this game is the ugly ass filter on it
Me too! üî•üëèüèæüòÅ
If on PC how did you fix the god awfull mouse aim? Or did you just suffer through it?
    I play with a controller
    What‚Äôs wrong with it? I never had a problem with mouse.
        Making a small upwards or downwards movement is pretty much impossible.
Ah, well more power to you!
How's about everyone on xbox gets online in 7 hours (midnight). Ranked death matches and racing. Who's in?
The story is the best out of all the gta series and so is the driving, but god i hate that map
GTA IV is a blast to go back and play. It does have its ups and downs which people like to ignore so they can say GTA V is worse, but IV is always a great source of entertainment. Also the main theme songs are my favorite out of the entire series.

 **I KEEP ON WALKING**

**ALL OVER THE CITY**
I love gta 4 also, can‚Äôt wait till the remastered version comes out.  Bet it will have 16 times the detail.
Wish I could play this game on my ps4.. If there was only one PS3 game I could play on the ps4 it would be this one no questions asked
    You could always buy a pc to play it really well even tho you need mods. Otherwise I really hope that the remaster news are true and it comes soon
        Yeah nah I don‚Äôt want remasters after the definitive edition debacle, I want the original game it‚Äôs such a classic.. yeah I‚Äôve seriously been debating on going to buy a PC just to play this one game lol
            Every game is just better on PC, you won‚Äôt regret it.
Gta 4 it's the best the only two things that I don't like it's the camera in the car being slightly to the left and the clothes are awful
Me too pal
Low-key the best gta, story wise it‚Äôs either this or SA for me, but 5 is up there for online
hope i don‚Äôt get any hate for this lol i‚Äôve been out of the gaming world for a while but recently got my hands on the no disc version of the ps5. i absolutely loved the gta series growing up but with all the bad comments i‚Äôve been seeing about the remastered series is they any way i could play this on the ps5?
me too
The lag is a bit noticable at times on the xbox one but I like it pretty well for the most part
The lag is a bit noticable at times on the xbox one but I like it pretty well for the most part
All I want is for Gta IV to be ported to current PlayStation consoles
Need to add it to ps4
I‚Äôd love them to remaster it
Be. Genetically. Different. Baby.
Haha soon the crooked hands of rockstar will get to this part too
I see fog that's going to be removed, in the future
Best story but very limited aspects of gameplay. Kinda the opposite of san andreas.
The best storyline of any of the gta games in my opinion.
It‚Äôs on sale on steam.
A true masterpiece.
Probably my favorite GTA.
Absolutely the best open world game on ps3 and xbox 360 generation by far, not even gta v with all the pointless online dlcs will get to what gta 4 was and still is.
One love, rasta.
GTA4 is hella good. I wish it didn‚Äôt feel so ‚Äúgrunge‚Äù and ‚Äúdirty‚Äù 

I like the cleaner feel, but it‚Äôs suppose to be more real and down to earth. BoGT is a bit more of how I wanted GTA4 basic to be. But it‚Äôs all good.
THEY NEED TO REMAKE NYC FOR ANOTHER GTA!
The ability to pick up a coffee cup and toss it at someone is enough to make this the best GTA.
Hands down my favorite GTA, probably next to VC. I‚Äôm a born and raised NY‚Äôer and the details they put in this game was actually insane. 

I actually found my old apartment complex in one of the neighborhoods and I genuinely still cannot believe it. They got everything from exterior design to the courtyard in the back. 

It‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve played, but I‚Äôm itching to at some point again.
Best GTA in my opinion the grit, comedy, art style and color grading really made this game a special piece of gaming history.
beautiful game for something from 2008
I honestly find it more fun than GTA V.
Really awesome game.

My first PC upgrade was so that I \*could\* play this game, it ran like shit, 30FPS at best but I finished it a few times... then GTA V came out, upgraded my PC for that and after finishing V I played IV and it ran a little better.

TLAD wasn't really my taste but TBoGT, I really, really liked it. Each character sees the world in a different way and I feel that they managed to show that.

Before GTA: Definitive Disappointment Edition Launch I started playing GTA IV again, this time, at 60+ FPS... all it took for me to run this game smoothly was like 10+ years and a RTX 3080.
Probably my least favorite gta game, yet it's still fantastic. Shows how good this series is
The only reason I like gta 5 is Trevor and online is better plus sex with prostitutes is more fun 4 had a better story though
GTA 4 Fan does the shut the fuck up about GTA 4 challenge! (IMPOSSIBLE)
Why is it always in gaming subreddits that a random game is suddenly the "best" and clearly better?? I mean sure IV might have some better physics than V but for the rest?
Same, such a great game!
I like that GTA4 still straddles the line of ridiculous hilarity and realism. GTA5 just has too much realism. The swing set glitch has literally entertained me for many hours.
Parkour and the shooting (even free aim on console) is just so fucking solid in this game. Makes certain missions so much more fun and different when you try it with different weapons and at different angles.
I didn't appreciate this game enough.
How do you get rid of the bad mouse aiming?
Same. It has the best story, for me. It wish it was better optimized for PC tho.
Enjoy it before Strauss's deFINiTiVE eDiTIon is forced upon us
Solid game, I replayed it before the remasters

The story is solid, I wish there was some more customization options though

I think San Andreas might be my favourite overall, but Vice City has the best music in my opinion
Hopefully gonna key a compete edition soon on a local add listing. It‚Äôs funny i love GTA games and was so hyped when it came out but at that time my system broke and couldn‚Äôt play it .
Please take meh to Liberty City, I want to gets out of San Andreas
Glad you like it but it was boring as shit from me as the characters are bland af.
I liked the game, but hated that horrible brown filter.

It was even worse, because I had to play it on the lowest setting when it came out lol.
My favorite too, dlc is good, graphics decently hold up, Unlike most GTA games, this game is very dark and gloomy and barely features any comedy, that's why I love it, and incredible voice acting, best ragdoll physics from ANY Rockstar game.
Just bought it, waiting for the install as I type this out. Brings me back to high school lol
i agree and can you please tell me how the framerate is too low?  
i just got it
I guess it's just nostalgia with GTA4 being the second GTA game I played(China Town Wars being my first), but somethin' about 4 just makes me enjoy it more than 5. 5's map just feels.. small, after playing 5 constantly for a couple years now, it just gets boring.

and the physics in 5 just feel.. boring? the car damage just makes crashing cars less exciting, NPC's feel weak, etc. I love GTA5 but GTA4 will always be my favorite :)
Just you wait till Grove Street games 'enhance' it
my favourite part of the gay tony dlc was when they brought back the bullet !
Me after going on date with Michelle instead of saving esshole cousin Roman from loan sharks
Such an amazing game.
The only thing I‚Äôm sad about this is the lack of proper optimization on the pc version. If this was fixed, it would‚Äôve been an all time go-to game (ofc with mods). I mean I still revisit this game but the pc performance needs improvement
2007-2009 were some great times for gaming.
Please remaster, properly
I don't care what anyone says, GTA IV was better overall compared to GTA V.
Grand theft auto 4 was rockstars most underrated masterpiece. From the muted colors to the simplistic weapon choices, it was pure gangsterism. Pretty much every mission was a hit, a heist, or track and retrieve. No stupid ‚ÄúRC driving‚Äù filler missions, and the fact that you could choose who lives and dies added even more depth. Not to mention little Jacob delivering guns anywhere to you on the map
Best gta

GTA 4 IS THE BEST!
Wow never knew there were still this many GTA 4 players tbh. Do any of you play GTA connected or citizenIV? GTA 4 is my favorite one by far, though it doesn't help it's the one I've played the most besides 3.
Yes! Underrated but I think it‚Äôs great!
My favorite modern GTA.... Car physics and Euphoria engine was amazing.
My favorite GTA aswell including the dlcs

Optimization is shite tho
Def my favorite I just finished about a month ago.
What city?
Driving a Sentinel around LC and listening to Joel Ortiz - Hip Hop, was priceless..
Better than 5 that‚Äôs for damn sure
Who don‚Äôt?
Who doesn‚Äôt have fun enjoy playing.
It is gorgeous
Favorite Game of All GTA IV
I hate the PC port. The helicopter controls with mouse and keyboard are awful. The game itself, amazing.
I love Grand Theft Auto IV also

Best gta
beautiful beautiful Tbogt
    That DLC brought out more of Liberty city that was missing in GTA 4. Liberty city is based on New York and one thing about new york it has legendary night life. TBOGT showed you New york life in 2007-2009.
    TBOGT could've been it's own game outright. That DLC was a masterpiece.
        As a complete package, easily GOAT.
        Wait‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a  dlc ? I only know it as Liberty city stories‚Ä¶. Guess I know what I‚Äôm buying later today. Is that Lost and Damned storyline  a dlc as well?
            Yup! TBOGT and Lost and Damned were both DLCs for GTAIV. I got mine in a trilogy bundle for PS3 years ago
                Shiieet I remember playing it years ago on my uncle‚Äôs console but then never being able to find a disc version myself. I‚Äôm definitely going to purchase both digitally and replay those bad boys‚Ä¶ Without cheats this time lol
                    Idt I ever even tried to play through without cheats until GTAV. It almost felt unnatural to grind out for weapons and ammo lol
    I though tht shit said lgbqt
        Well I guess Tony is gay in it.
            The Ballad of lGbtq Tiny
                What is tiny about him?
                    Nothing üòè
                        Your screen name oddly gives me confidence that this is true.
                HAHAHAH that is exactly how it would've been called if it came out today.
    that pause menu theme holds a special place in my heart. its so beautiful and atmospheric.
    TLAD gang. Fuck Trevor for stomping on his brain lol
        i feel TLAD was the weaker out of the two DLCs, but was still enjoyable.
            Understandable. It is. But its the only reason I got the complete trilogy edition. I always wanted to play a biker gang game and that was the only one that did it right
                the mechanics were fantastic though! the story was meh to me. i wish some of those mechanics translated to GTAO for their biker update but it wasn‚Äôt stellar. :(
                    Yeah. I appreciate that it even got made in the first place because motorcycle club genre arent that popular in the mainstream. Like the Sons of Anarchy show, nobody talks about it.

And yeah i downloaded gta 5 again just for the biker club dlc. The bikes are nice but they didn't put much effort.
        Yeah fuck him, one of the most bullshit deaths (especially MC death) ever, Gta V is so badly written.
        Trevors the man takes a dump behind a dumpster waiting for a meet with Michael like a boss!
        OMG, what a OST dude! I remember driving trought the streets whit Aerosmith "Lord Of The Thighs" playing at the radio!
    Should I get tbogt before or after I complete the base game? I hear that Tbogt is a better dlc than the base game as itself. There is also TLAD but I think I heard that TBOGT was better, but had less weapons than TLAD. Most importantly tho does TBOGT have better mission structure than the base game, because the base game missions are honestly kinda gets boring with all the track down and follow in vehicle missions. This last question is the deal breaker for me, so if the answer is yes for this one, I‚Äôm totally gonna get TBOGT.

Edit: edit to make the questions more structured I guess.
        Tbogt's alot more memorable. base game for plot, tbogt for literally everything else. And yes, missions...shoot em ups here and there, but is actually quite creative with its structure. 2015 me speaking, memory so could be biased.
        Yes, you are right TBOGT is the best of these 3. GTA IV has indeed a lot of repetitive missions that can be completed just with a drive-by, while TBOGT has more diverse and memorable missions. But if I remember well there are just 25 main story missions, and TLAD has another 25. For the story you should play first GTAIV, as the stories interconnect at some points, then TLAD then TBoGT. But just for the missions' fun and quality TBoGT is the best of them.
        GTA IV FIRST OF COURSE. Or the first cutscene won't make sense at all in TBoGT, also you will not understand the connection the DLC's have to the main story. Because you DO see the main characters from TBoGT and TLAD in IV as Niko, they both cross paths with Niko a few times in IV, I don't wanna spoil the details, just play GTA IV base first.
It actually had DLC compared to GTA 5 which had non even though it was hinted in some way but instead they went the cheap way and did online. The DLC's also improved the music on the radio stations in GTA 4 by a mile.  It made cruising in your car or riding your motorcycle just a fun thing to do. Both character were great add and their good enough to have their own GTA stand alone even though Luis is the one who I could see in GTA 6 or another GTA game.
    It's good that all radio stations from GTA IV and EFLC are combined together in the later versions of GTA IV. Back then you can only listen songs and radio stations of GTA IV that are not in EFLC and vice versa. Now you can listen to the Vibe in TBoGT and Vice City FM in GTA IV. Hell other radio stations like Vladivostok FM combined songs from GTA IV (Russian music) and TBOGT (House music)
        what versions of GTA 4 can you listen because I have the OG version of the game when it came out.
            Check out PC mods to get back stations that were removed
            The new version in PC, in the Rockstar Launcher. It combines GTA IV with the two DLCs
                Ah man too bad the PS3 versions dont because I hate the GTA 4 music its the worst in the series and the game is 7th gen console.
        I  consider merging music from both games disadvantage. Simply because  some stations changed their genres
            They combined the genres like in Vladivostok FM it switches from Russian to House
                Yes, this is  exactly what I said.
    Can you imagine seeing Luis again or working for him? That'd be badass I just really hope they don't kill him off or make him seem like an asshole, at the end of the day he had a good head on his shoulders and was loyal
        If I remember correctly TBGOT didn't have bad ending it had a good or decent ending.  Luis was loyal and never disrepected Gay tony. He stuck up for tony and looked out for him when everyone just wanted a piece of his wealth. Luis can handle himself as good as of the GTA lead characters in the other games.   I can see luis and tony going down to  modern day vice city opening up some of clubs doing what they did before in liberty city.  Or luis goes solo and tony makes an appearance or cameo in the game. He's character that I was surprised was not in GTA V in some way but they bring Johnny to kill him, and packie back but relagate him to henchmen in heists.
    [deleted]
        Prior to earlier this year I was confused by this, now I've actually played TLAD I hate Trevor even more lol
            I still can't fucking believe they did that to Johnny. It's not canon at all for me. Fuck that's not even Trevor for me. He wouldn't do that, even if it's hos early stage crazy persona, which gradually grows imo. Clay and Terry... Jesus. What a huge slap in the face. If they used Niko instead the fans would revolt.
                Just replayed yesterday actually, and I absolutely agree. Johnny at the end of TLAD would have never let himself and the Lost slip to what they are in 5. He was an actual interesting character, and they just made Trevor out to be the wacky crazy loose cannon.
                    Yup it's a cheap shot. Using shock factor to show how "badass" Trevor is. Imagine if Franklin killed CJ! That's no way to treat your fans imo
    And what does gta 5 do? Take a good character from the dlc, shit in his mouth,  ruin his life and gets him killed by one of the MC, first run I killed Trevor at the end.
Back when we actually got meaningful DLC. Like almost completely new games
    I was **so so so** disappointed that the GTA 5 dlc never materialized: that city is so vast and detailed, there are a million stories waiting to be told there. Buuuuuuuuut‚Ä¶ nope.
        They‚Äôre huge assholes, but it ended up making them literal billions diverting resources to GTAO. I get it, but it‚Äôs sucks so hard that they‚Äôre rereleasing GTA V again‚Ä¶like why don‚Äôt you add DLC and we‚Äôd buy it in droves before the next GTA VI.

Ah, fuck. I just want GTA VI now, the boat already passed with GTA V DLC
        Same with Red Dead
    The GTAIV trilogy is a work of art.
        It really is. From the writing to the seamless ways they interweave the narratives between the 3 characters. Never noticed Luis or Johnny in my first playthrough really til the DLC
Me too
Loved the DLCs for it, sucks that you can't get them on Xbox anymore for some reason, made the mistake of giving my friend the disc for it so now it thinks I don't own em.
Isn‚Äôt IV the only one that ever had SP DLC?
What about TLAD
What about seeing some big American titties?
GTA IV had way more realistic gun play and AI.
    GTA IV is all about the driving physics.
        I just went to IV after playing though VC and SA, I can't get the cars under control on PC, glad you can just take a cab as well.
            I just tried VC DE, so hard to drive in this game after all those years. Therefore I damaged my cars and died 2 times because they explode ridiculously fast once they're on fire. I'm done until a serious update comes.
            Yeah PC GTA 4 driving is bad with mouse and keyboard because I'm guessing it just engages the throttle fully instead of with a controller it's a pressure sensitive trigger.
Not if you >!choose the deal ending!<
The minigames in IV were amazing man
Gta v has randomized license plates
Gta iv has the same license plate saying liberty city despite the fact that the game is set in 2 states 
Gta v is better because of better license plates
same except got it on pc again few weeks ago
Watch out for bad man!!
    *Well...*

üò•
All of the characters in IV are so endearing. Special mention too to Dwayne and Brucie
    I always save dwayne.
        You‚Äôve got no heart if you even consider doing otherwise. Plus scoring all of Playboy‚Äôs stuff is an added bonus tbh
            Lol a super sweet apartment is definitely a bonus
seen
Agreed. I would say this applies to all the characters. Every single person had a distinct personality.
Sounds like a subreddit lmao
    /r/gta4circlejerk
        Brilliant
Feels good to read something so true.
GTA V killed my dog and burnt my house
    This sub chooses a new gta game to suck off every month and all the other gta games are awful compared to it
Tell that to GTA 4's driving
    I unironically love GTA 4's driving.
    it was great and satisfying gta 5's too soft and repetitive its like driving the same car over nd over again
        But look at games that base their whole game around driving like Forza horizon. In horizon the driving feels decently realistic yet it isnt like driving on ice. I'd say it's alot more like gta5 driving
            Horizon is arcady unless you mess withe settings , gta 4‚Äôs handling model had more of a simulation feel to it and it was very satisfying and rewarding, gta 5¬¥s is not bad by any means but just not as rewarding as the 4th‚Äôs
            Gta 4 is not like that either. It only feels like the roads are ice if you try applying GTA SA/5 style driving to it.

If you actually drive carefully and like you would in real life, it's a lot more manageable. Of course you're gonna slide if you're driving 100kmh and turn into a sharp corner with your handbreak
                Exactly! It looks slow, so people think they can just turn around while driving 100km/h.
                What an awful take, literally who plays gta without driving like a maniac?
                    Me, you don't need to always press the gas, you can just let it go when you wanna take turns.
                    You don't need to drive like a normal citizen, literally just slow down before corners.
                > If you actually drive carefully and like you would in real life, it's a lot more manageable.

but in real life you also dont drive slow and i can instantly see that in gta 4 the car wheels had oil into them and the ground is ice
                    > but in real life you also dont drive slow

Wtf are you smoking? You clearly never driven a car lmao. Show me your car that slides through corners at 50+ in NYC traffic.
            The tire spin , suspension travel , damage model were greater
    I still prefer IVs driving physics, until they break
    4 had more realistic driving
        Realistic isn't better.
            tell that to RDR2 & most likely GTA VI (if that's ever confirmed lol)
                Tbf the more realistic parts of rdr2 are either amazing or make the game wayyy more boring, no in between
            In your opinion
        Realistic? Just say you never driven a car before.
            Yes, it's the most realistic driving in the entire GTA series so it's a valid point. Actually it's more realistic than even many actual racing games.

I'm not a GTA 4 fanboy either, it just sounds like you never played 4 or you're the one who has never driven.
                Driving on buttery roads is now realistic now? You IV fanboys are funny.
                    Someone was bad at driving in IV. Git gud.
                        Ah yes, the classic "If you don't like it you're just bad at it".
            Lol I suppose I walked to work this morning did I? It‚Äôs definitely more realistic than the driving in gta v anyway
                What does V have to do with this? Are IV fanboys so insecure that V is more popular that they bring up when no one else did?
                    Do you want to read back through the comments and see what we‚Äôre talking about here. It‚Äôs literally comparing the two
            > Realistic? Just say you never driven a car before.

Lmao what a hill do to die mate. A really terrible one indeed.
                Oh yes because I am the one who brought it up first.
            You never driven a car before
                You guys must crashing all the timeS
                    Yes because I love the crash physics and the deformation system in the game is insane
                        When you roll a cop car over and the siren gets all wonky
                            Love that
    That‚Äôs the only downfall of this game, playing it now and the amount of times I spin out is ridiculous
        Stop overcorrecting
            Fair point, I had to learn quickly it‚Äôs light taps and steers, but it‚Äôs not Forza level handling or control it feels like a badly implemented realism
        Lotta people in this comment section are saying they like it so I'm surprised I didn't get mass downvoted lol. I feel like it's because the cars can lose traction much too easily just by steering. Most racing games and games with good feeling driving don't allow you to spin out by steering especially in a passenger sedan. A Lambo is a different story though it makes sense for fast things to spin out when accelerating
            The overall driving just "feels" slow. So when driving full speed, it doesn't feel like 200km/h and people think they can make a sharp turn.
I love the driving in IV, 5 was too arcadey for me (controlling the car mid-air etc.)
            I agree, the sports cars it actually did feel realistic in a way because it was you tryna harness all the horsepower into a straight shot. The regular 4 door sedan doing that shit tho is bonkers, and even worse is the Porsche, one of the nicest handling cars is like driving on ice.

This game seriously excelled the series by eons, but the driving was definitely an experiment in realism gone wrong. I definitely enjoy GTA V driving the best
                The driving is one of the best aspects of IV. It has weight. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it takes some skill to master. You can‚Äôt say that about V‚Äôs driving. 

And I like V‚Äôs too but it gets boring when every car controls basically the exact same. At least in IV, I can tell the difference between a sports car and a van, because the game does a far better job of simulating the difference in weight.
    In my personal experience, 4's driving doesn't stand a chance against 5's
        you misspelled opinion
            Did I insult his opinion? I just presented my own.
    I would assume this take comes from not being good at driving in 4. It‚Äôs very possible to drive great In 4 you just have to actually pay attention and use the handbrake.
        I use the handbrake in 5 alot. And also you can't really tell me I'm not good at driving in games. I play a ton of Forza and other racing games. I'm used to all sorts of driving mechanics in games. That said you can't blame skill for people not liking something when it's such a 50/50 issue. Half of people seem to like it and defend it and the other half agree with me that it feels very slippery. When you drive your car for real do you spin out like that from turning the wheel hard? Not really. Unless we are supposed to believe every passenger car has rear wheel drive and 300hp under the hood
        I have no problems adapting to IV's driving after playing the 3d games as well as V, but it's definitely not my favorite. They went way too far trying to make it "realistic".
Insecure much.
Yep, I‚Äôd spend hours as a teen just punching a bunch of taxis and getting chased by 30 angry cab drivers then taking them all out with a baseball bat, I love the euphoria physics engine, WAAAAAAY better and immersive than the shit physics engine they used in gta v.
The insta killing is annoying. I liked how you could have legitimate fights in GTA 4.
    I‚Äôve been revisiting IV on my XSX now that it runs at 60fps on console (and quick resume is a nice bonus)- I‚Äôve had so much fun just dicking around in this game. Punched a taxi in front of a cop car to make the taxi driver get out and start a fight with me, letting him land a couple blows. The cops got out of their car and arrested him, put him in the back of the cop car, then I stole the cop car and drove around doing stunts with that taxi driver in the backseat. I also started a fist fight with someone on the street (dressed as a gang banger) then they pulled out a baseball bat and beat the shit out of me. Don‚Äôt really remember having that much fun messing around with pedestrians in V which was a bummer considering I imagined V would be a major upgrade in all departments, not just some
        It‚Äôs great isn‚Äôt it? GTA IV really did an excellent job giving you the resources to really do whatever you wanted. I might have to revisit it this weekend!
I'd say Vice City Stories has my favourite melee combat of them all, still the only GTA that allowed you to grapple and snap necks. None of the GTAs could compare to The Warriors though.
At least RDR2 was a return to form
Yup. Combat is 5‚Äôs biggest flaw. It‚Äôs so linear or monotonous, no variety whatsoever
Yeah the pc version sucks, I am using fusi√≥n fix and the Vulkan mod and it runs better but this game screams for good and well done remaster
    Is there a patch out that gets rid of that god awful Games For Windows Live DRM?
        There actually was a mod at some point, I believe. I know it's possible to remove it.
        [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GTAIV/comments/kwcvs4/gta_iv_physical_copy/gj3kajn/)
    Good and well done? After the trilogy fiasco, I have little faith that will ever happen.
Runs pretty decently on Xbox
I am playing it on a Xbox series s and it still has frame drops in heavy traffic. Draw distance is pretty weak as well as it blurs everything in the background, but the background is like 200 ft away. It‚Äôs still a good game but don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth you switching to Xbox on.
I had to hard reset my whole pc and after that the game was no longer stuttering. Well there‚Äôs a solution for you
The 5 story was difficult to follow and the stakes didn't seem very high. We all expected Franklin to be the new CJ, but it's clear he's the third wheel in the drama of the story. With character switching, it felt hard to connect with anyone's story as they were interconnected anyhow
    Yeah the character switching was a awesome feature, especially when randomly switching to Trevor and seeing some crazy stuff, but it really did hurt my ability to really get a real connection with any one of them. I do gotta say though that seeing Los Santos get a glow up blew me away when I first played.
        The character switch was pointless imo, and underutilized. All three characters play exactly the same apart from their special abilities so it ended up being nothing more than a gimmick. 

And not being able to switch during hang outs was laughable.
            It was a plot device how is it a gimmick? They're not different power rangers they're all normal humans lol what were you expecting exactly?
                I was expecting to be able to switch between them when you had a wanted level so you could actually have fun using the mechanic against the cops in free roam.
            I hated it and consequently never bothered finishing the game.
I like 4 a lot but the driving feels so bad. It's what I imagine driving was like in 1950s.
    Idk I just like it, five is so perfect with the driving that it really feels like driving toy cars but for me in 4 it feels like it‚Äôs got some weight behind the wheel. I know a lot of people hate it and I completely understand lol.
    It feels bad because you don‚Äôt have the skills required. I was the same when I first played IV. Crashed into everything, spun out etc.
        No I was good at driving. It still feels pretty bad
            Not good enough
    I'm right there with ya the driving mechanics are too complicated for a non racing focused game.
        Not everyone likes the boring Mario Karts from GTA V‚Ä¶
Why the hell do people always have to compare IV to V in this subreddit? Why not compare it to some other GTA games also?
    Because they‚Äôre the only two in the HD universe?
        I guess you can compare the gameplay but there's no excuse for comparing the story.
    Because V is after IV genius.
It‚Äôs like the red dead 2 of gta games. If that makes sense. 

Sure the graphics aren‚Äôt amazing today, but everything else is still top tier. 

Let‚Äôs face it, the only open world drive around stealing cars and killing people simulator with physics that even come close, is gtav. Gta 4 has the best roadkill physics of any open world game to this day. 

No wonder it ran at 20-30fps on consoles, honestly I‚Äôm amazed they even got it working at all considering it‚Äôs still got the most complex physics of any open world drive on the sidewalk game.
The only bad thing about the physics was driving. Yes it was realistic but it should also have been fun.
    They should've fixed the slipperiness instead of completely deleting the driving physics in V.
    Yeah the community is kind of half-half with the car physics of gta 4, I personally enjoyed it as once you figured out each cars different weight and body roll you could pretty much lose people quite easily in GTA 4 free mode online where as GTA Online, any 12 year old with a supercar can just quickly catch up no matter how good you drive based on the car physics being so arcadey.
100%
Nice! Though why torture yourself with a controller?
    haha to me its more natural as a long time console player
GTA race. You die? Respawn on a moped.
I loved the multiplayer as well, I enjoyed it way more than 5's. 'Cannoball' Races across the city with randoms online were some of the most fun matches I've had in an online game.
    Agreed. It was a simple and fun multiplayer. Especially races and open world airport fights.
Do you mean at release or today? This game gets a TON of praise today. I'd go as far as to say it's overrated.
    At the release of course. That's why i said 'when its released' in the comment. A lot of people says its was a great game and better than 5 nowadays.
Pc, this is vanilla, only fusi√≥n fix
Looks good because it's 4k + sunsets are always nice. Though there're plenty of vanilla friendly mods like [CleanIV](https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24247)
I will tell you a secret. I'm playing the game at 8k, so this screenshots is basically an 8k picture lol
The GTA community in general obsesses over this game constantly. I don't mind it since IV is amazing, but IV fanboys are absolute cancer. They're so hypocritical it's hilarious.
    I think it‚Äôs a good game but I‚Äôve noticed a lot more posts on it lately like everyone is jumping on a IV love bandwagon
Circlejerking for internet points
I think GTA V shooting and driving aged a bit and they feel like they came from 1994, but of course different people have different tastes.
Yeah man I was so dissapointed with the trilogy remaster that I had to come back to this
    I‚Äôve rarely had any problems with the trilogy in my opinion except for like 2 bugs but after that everything else was fine for me
        For me its not about the bugs, but about the quality presentation
            Well that too I‚Äôve really never let bother myself either
Having a bad day pal?
    Iam happy that u r able to play this  game. :)
I agree that the game could have made Michelle a bigger part of the story (and I wish she was) but this is no different than Michael and Franklin acting like father and son after knowing each other for 5 minutes. It throws them together by pure coincidence too so it feels contrived. 

But there isn‚Äôt really an answer to make the plot and gameplay line up in a GTA game. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to go out and slaughter pedestrians either, but you can do it. And GTA 5‚Äôs half assed attempts at making it seem like it makes sense, such as having Michael tell his therapist that he is a psycho one minute and a saint the next, are pathetic. Better to just accept the situation, and ignore it, because there is no fix.
Who wants to fight your opinion?
So far I like the game and I don‚Äôt mind the dark tone BUT the mission structures kill the fun because half of them so far are just tracking missions where you have to follow some random dude to kill him until he crashes or until you kill him, or your following a train or chopper or whatever.
    Yeah, that's one thing IV lacked. I think the story more than makes up for it though. If you plan on playing TLAD and TBOGT, they massively improve on the mission structure. The missions are so much more fun in the DLCs.
I play with a controller
What‚Äôs wrong with it? I never had a problem with mouse.
    Making a small upwards or downwards movement is pretty much impossible.
You could always buy a pc to play it really well even tho you need mods. Otherwise I really hope that the remaster news are true and it comes soon
    Yeah nah I don‚Äôt want remasters after the definitive edition debacle, I want the original game it‚Äôs such a classic.. yeah I‚Äôve seriously been debating on going to buy a PC just to play this one game lol
        Every game is just better on PC, you won‚Äôt regret it.
That DLC brought out more of Liberty city that was missing in GTA 4. Liberty city is based on New York and one thing about new york it has legendary night life. TBOGT showed you New york life in 2007-2009.
TBOGT could've been it's own game outright. That DLC was a masterpiece.
    As a complete package, easily GOAT.
    Wait‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a  dlc ? I only know it as Liberty city stories‚Ä¶. Guess I know what I‚Äôm buying later today. Is that Lost and Damned storyline  a dlc as well?
        Yup! TBOGT and Lost and Damned were both DLCs for GTAIV. I got mine in a trilogy bundle for PS3 years ago
            Shiieet I remember playing it years ago on my uncle‚Äôs console but then never being able to find a disc version myself. I‚Äôm definitely going to purchase both digitally and replay those bad boys‚Ä¶ Without cheats this time lol
                Idt I ever even tried to play through without cheats until GTAV. It almost felt unnatural to grind out for weapons and ammo lol
I though tht shit said lgbqt
    Well I guess Tony is gay in it.
        The Ballad of lGbtq Tiny
            What is tiny about him?
                Nothing üòè
                    Your screen name oddly gives me confidence that this is true.
            HAHAHAH that is exactly how it would've been called if it came out today.
that pause menu theme holds a special place in my heart. its so beautiful and atmospheric.
TLAD gang. Fuck Trevor for stomping on his brain lol
    i feel TLAD was the weaker out of the two DLCs, but was still enjoyable.
        Understandable. It is. But its the only reason I got the complete trilogy edition. I always wanted to play a biker gang game and that was the only one that did it right
            the mechanics were fantastic though! the story was meh to me. i wish some of those mechanics translated to GTAO for their biker update but it wasn‚Äôt stellar. :(
                Yeah. I appreciate that it even got made in the first place because motorcycle club genre arent that popular in the mainstream. Like the Sons of Anarchy show, nobody talks about it.

And yeah i downloaded gta 5 again just for the biker club dlc. The bikes are nice but they didn't put much effort.
    Yeah fuck him, one of the most bullshit deaths (especially MC death) ever, Gta V is so badly written.
    Trevors the man takes a dump behind a dumpster waiting for a meet with Michael like a boss!
    OMG, what a OST dude! I remember driving trought the streets whit Aerosmith "Lord Of The Thighs" playing at the radio!
Should I get tbogt before or after I complete the base game? I hear that Tbogt is a better dlc than the base game as itself. There is also TLAD but I think I heard that TBOGT was better, but had less weapons than TLAD. Most importantly tho does TBOGT have better mission structure than the base game, because the base game missions are honestly kinda gets boring with all the track down and follow in vehicle missions. This last question is the deal breaker for me, so if the answer is yes for this one, I‚Äôm totally gonna get TBOGT.

Edit: edit to make the questions more structured I guess.
    Tbogt's alot more memorable. base game for plot, tbogt for literally everything else. And yes, missions...shoot em ups here and there, but is actually quite creative with its structure. 2015 me speaking, memory so could be biased.
    Yes, you are right TBOGT is the best of these 3. GTA IV has indeed a lot of repetitive missions that can be completed just with a drive-by, while TBOGT has more diverse and memorable missions. But if I remember well there are just 25 main story missions, and TLAD has another 25. For the story you should play first GTAIV, as the stories interconnect at some points, then TLAD then TBoGT. But just for the missions' fun and quality TBoGT is the best of them.
    GTA IV FIRST OF COURSE. Or the first cutscene won't make sense at all in TBoGT, also you will not understand the connection the DLC's have to the main story. Because you DO see the main characters from TBoGT and TLAD in IV as Niko, they both cross paths with Niko a few times in IV, I don't wanna spoil the details, just play GTA IV base first.
It's good that all radio stations from GTA IV and EFLC are combined together in the later versions of GTA IV. Back then you can only listen songs and radio stations of GTA IV that are not in EFLC and vice versa. Now you can listen to the Vibe in TBoGT and Vice City FM in GTA IV. Hell other radio stations like Vladivostok FM combined songs from GTA IV (Russian music) and TBOGT (House music)
    what versions of GTA 4 can you listen because I have the OG version of the game when it came out.
        Check out PC mods to get back stations that were removed
        The new version in PC, in the Rockstar Launcher. It combines GTA IV with the two DLCs
            Ah man too bad the PS3 versions dont because I hate the GTA 4 music its the worst in the series and the game is 7th gen console.
    I  consider merging music from both games disadvantage. Simply because  some stations changed their genres
        They combined the genres like in Vladivostok FM it switches from Russian to House
            Yes, this is  exactly what I said.
Can you imagine seeing Luis again or working for him? That'd be badass I just really hope they don't kill him off or make him seem like an asshole, at the end of the day he had a good head on his shoulders and was loyal
    If I remember correctly TBGOT didn't have bad ending it had a good or decent ending.  Luis was loyal and never disrepected Gay tony. He stuck up for tony and looked out for him when everyone just wanted a piece of his wealth. Luis can handle himself as good as of the GTA lead characters in the other games.   I can see luis and tony going down to  modern day vice city opening up some of clubs doing what they did before in liberty city.  Or luis goes solo and tony makes an appearance or cameo in the game. He's character that I was surprised was not in GTA V in some way but they bring Johnny to kill him, and packie back but relagate him to henchmen in heists.
[deleted]
    Prior to earlier this year I was confused by this, now I've actually played TLAD I hate Trevor even more lol
        I still can't fucking believe they did that to Johnny. It's not canon at all for me. Fuck that's not even Trevor for me. He wouldn't do that, even if it's hos early stage crazy persona, which gradually grows imo. Clay and Terry... Jesus. What a huge slap in the face. If they used Niko instead the fans would revolt.
            Just replayed yesterday actually, and I absolutely agree. Johnny at the end of TLAD would have never let himself and the Lost slip to what they are in 5. He was an actual interesting character, and they just made Trevor out to be the wacky crazy loose cannon.
                Yup it's a cheap shot. Using shock factor to show how "badass" Trevor is. Imagine if Franklin killed CJ! That's no way to treat your fans imo
And what does gta 5 do? Take a good character from the dlc, shit in his mouth,  ruin his life and gets him killed by one of the MC, first run I killed Trevor at the end.
I was **so so so** disappointed that the GTA 5 dlc never materialized: that city is so vast and detailed, there are a million stories waiting to be told there. Buuuuuuuuut‚Ä¶ nope.
    They‚Äôre huge assholes, but it ended up making them literal billions diverting resources to GTAO. I get it, but it‚Äôs sucks so hard that they‚Äôre rereleasing GTA V again‚Ä¶like why don‚Äôt you add DLC and we‚Äôd buy it in droves before the next GTA VI.

Ah, fuck. I just want GTA VI now, the boat already passed with GTA V DLC
    Same with Red Dead
The GTAIV trilogy is a work of art.
    It really is. From the writing to the seamless ways they interweave the narratives between the 3 characters. Never noticed Luis or Johnny in my first playthrough really til the DLC
GTA IV is all about the driving physics.
    I just went to IV after playing though VC and SA, I can't get the cars under control on PC, glad you can just take a cab as well.
        I just tried VC DE, so hard to drive in this game after all those years. Therefore I damaged my cars and died 2 times because they explode ridiculously fast once they're on fire. I'm done until a serious update comes.
        Yeah PC GTA 4 driving is bad with mouse and keyboard because I'm guessing it just engages the throttle fully instead of with a controller it's a pressure sensitive trigger.
*Well...*

üò•
I always save dwayne.
    You‚Äôve got no heart if you even consider doing otherwise. Plus scoring all of Playboy‚Äôs stuff is an added bonus tbh
        Lol a super sweet apartment is definitely a bonus
/r/gta4circlejerk
    Brilliant
This sub chooses a new gta game to suck off every month and all the other gta games are awful compared to it
I unironically love GTA 4's driving.
it was great and satisfying gta 5's too soft and repetitive its like driving the same car over nd over again
    But look at games that base their whole game around driving like Forza horizon. In horizon the driving feels decently realistic yet it isnt like driving on ice. I'd say it's alot more like gta5 driving
        Horizon is arcady unless you mess withe settings , gta 4‚Äôs handling model had more of a simulation feel to it and it was very satisfying and rewarding, gta 5¬¥s is not bad by any means but just not as rewarding as the 4th‚Äôs
        Gta 4 is not like that either. It only feels like the roads are ice if you try applying GTA SA/5 style driving to it.

If you actually drive carefully and like you would in real life, it's a lot more manageable. Of course you're gonna slide if you're driving 100kmh and turn into a sharp corner with your handbreak
            Exactly! It looks slow, so people think they can just turn around while driving 100km/h.
            What an awful take, literally who plays gta without driving like a maniac?
                Me, you don't need to always press the gas, you can just let it go when you wanna take turns.
                You don't need to drive like a normal citizen, literally just slow down before corners.
            > If you actually drive carefully and like you would in real life, it's a lot more manageable.

but in real life you also dont drive slow and i can instantly see that in gta 4 the car wheels had oil into them and the ground is ice
                > but in real life you also dont drive slow

Wtf are you smoking? You clearly never driven a car lmao. Show me your car that slides through corners at 50+ in NYC traffic.
        The tire spin , suspension travel , damage model were greater
I still prefer IVs driving physics, until they break
4 had more realistic driving
    Realistic isn't better.
        tell that to RDR2 & most likely GTA VI (if that's ever confirmed lol)
            Tbf the more realistic parts of rdr2 are either amazing or make the game wayyy more boring, no in between
        In your opinion
    Realistic? Just say you never driven a car before.
        Yes, it's the most realistic driving in the entire GTA series so it's a valid point. Actually it's more realistic than even many actual racing games.

I'm not a GTA 4 fanboy either, it just sounds like you never played 4 or you're the one who has never driven.
            Driving on buttery roads is now realistic now? You IV fanboys are funny.
                Someone was bad at driving in IV. Git gud.
                    Ah yes, the classic "If you don't like it you're just bad at it".
        Lol I suppose I walked to work this morning did I? It‚Äôs definitely more realistic than the driving in gta v anyway
            What does V have to do with this? Are IV fanboys so insecure that V is more popular that they bring up when no one else did?
                Do you want to read back through the comments and see what we‚Äôre talking about here. It‚Äôs literally comparing the two
        > Realistic? Just say you never driven a car before.

Lmao what a hill do to die mate. A really terrible one indeed.
            Oh yes because I am the one who brought it up first.
        You never driven a car before
            You guys must crashing all the timeS
                Yes because I love the crash physics and the deformation system in the game is insane
                    When you roll a cop car over and the siren gets all wonky
                        Love that
That‚Äôs the only downfall of this game, playing it now and the amount of times I spin out is ridiculous
    Stop overcorrecting
        Fair point, I had to learn quickly it‚Äôs light taps and steers, but it‚Äôs not Forza level handling or control it feels like a badly implemented realism
    Lotta people in this comment section are saying they like it so I'm surprised I didn't get mass downvoted lol. I feel like it's because the cars can lose traction much too easily just by steering. Most racing games and games with good feeling driving don't allow you to spin out by steering especially in a passenger sedan. A Lambo is a different story though it makes sense for fast things to spin out when accelerating
        The overall driving just "feels" slow. So when driving full speed, it doesn't feel like 200km/h and people think they can make a sharp turn.
I love the driving in IV, 5 was too arcadey for me (controlling the car mid-air etc.)
        I agree, the sports cars it actually did feel realistic in a way because it was you tryna harness all the horsepower into a straight shot. The regular 4 door sedan doing that shit tho is bonkers, and even worse is the Porsche, one of the nicest handling cars is like driving on ice.

This game seriously excelled the series by eons, but the driving was definitely an experiment in realism gone wrong. I definitely enjoy GTA V driving the best
            The driving is one of the best aspects of IV. It has weight. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it takes some skill to master. You can‚Äôt say that about V‚Äôs driving. 

And I like V‚Äôs too but it gets boring when every car controls basically the exact same. At least in IV, I can tell the difference between a sports car and a van, because the game does a far better job of simulating the difference in weight.
In my personal experience, 4's driving doesn't stand a chance against 5's
    you misspelled opinion
        Did I insult his opinion? I just presented my own.
I would assume this take comes from not being good at driving in 4. It‚Äôs very possible to drive great In 4 you just have to actually pay attention and use the handbrake.
    I use the handbrake in 5 alot. And also you can't really tell me I'm not good at driving in games. I play a ton of Forza and other racing games. I'm used to all sorts of driving mechanics in games. That said you can't blame skill for people not liking something when it's such a 50/50 issue. Half of people seem to like it and defend it and the other half agree with me that it feels very slippery. When you drive your car for real do you spin out like that from turning the wheel hard? Not really. Unless we are supposed to believe every passenger car has rear wheel drive and 300hp under the hood
    I have no problems adapting to IV's driving after playing the 3d games as well as V, but it's definitely not my favorite. They went way too far trying to make it "realistic".
I‚Äôve been revisiting IV on my XSX now that it runs at 60fps on console (and quick resume is a nice bonus)- I‚Äôve had so much fun just dicking around in this game. Punched a taxi in front of a cop car to make the taxi driver get out and start a fight with me, letting him land a couple blows. The cops got out of their car and arrested him, put him in the back of the cop car, then I stole the cop car and drove around doing stunts with that taxi driver in the backseat. I also started a fist fight with someone on the street (dressed as a gang banger) then they pulled out a baseball bat and beat the shit out of me. Don‚Äôt really remember having that much fun messing around with pedestrians in V which was a bummer considering I imagined V would be a major upgrade in all departments, not just some
    It‚Äôs great isn‚Äôt it? GTA IV really did an excellent job giving you the resources to really do whatever you wanted. I might have to revisit it this weekend!
Is there a patch out that gets rid of that god awful Games For Windows Live DRM?
    There actually was a mod at some point, I believe. I know it's possible to remove it.
    [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GTAIV/comments/kwcvs4/gta_iv_physical_copy/gj3kajn/)
Good and well done? After the trilogy fiasco, I have little faith that will ever happen.
Yeah the character switching was a awesome feature, especially when randomly switching to Trevor and seeing some crazy stuff, but it really did hurt my ability to really get a real connection with any one of them. I do gotta say though that seeing Los Santos get a glow up blew me away when I first played.
    The character switch was pointless imo, and underutilized. All three characters play exactly the same apart from their special abilities so it ended up being nothing more than a gimmick. 

And not being able to switch during hang outs was laughable.
        It was a plot device how is it a gimmick? They're not different power rangers they're all normal humans lol what were you expecting exactly?
            I was expecting to be able to switch between them when you had a wanted level so you could actually have fun using the mechanic against the cops in free roam.
        I hated it and consequently never bothered finishing the game.
Idk I just like it, five is so perfect with the driving that it really feels like driving toy cars but for me in 4 it feels like it‚Äôs got some weight behind the wheel. I know a lot of people hate it and I completely understand lol.
It feels bad because you don‚Äôt have the skills required. I was the same when I first played IV. Crashed into everything, spun out etc.
    No I was good at driving. It still feels pretty bad
        Not good enough
I'm right there with ya the driving mechanics are too complicated for a non racing focused game.
    Not everyone likes the boring Mario Karts from GTA V‚Ä¶
Because they‚Äôre the only two in the HD universe?
    I guess you can compare the gameplay but there's no excuse for comparing the story.
Because V is after IV genius.
They should've fixed the slipperiness instead of completely deleting the driving physics in V.
Yeah the community is kind of half-half with the car physics of gta 4, I personally enjoyed it as once you figured out each cars different weight and body roll you could pretty much lose people quite easily in GTA 4 free mode online where as GTA Online, any 12 year old with a supercar can just quickly catch up no matter how good you drive based on the car physics being so arcadey.
haha to me its more natural as a long time console player
Agreed. It was a simple and fun multiplayer. Especially races and open world airport fights.
At the release of course. That's why i said 'when its released' in the comment. A lot of people says its was a great game and better than 5 nowadays.
I think it‚Äôs a good game but I‚Äôve noticed a lot more posts on it lately like everyone is jumping on a IV love bandwagon
I‚Äôve rarely had any problems with the trilogy in my opinion except for like 2 bugs but after that everything else was fine for me
    For me its not about the bugs, but about the quality presentation
        Well that too I‚Äôve really never let bother myself either
Iam happy that u r able to play this  game. :)
Yeah, that's one thing IV lacked. I think the story more than makes up for it though. If you plan on playing TLAD and TBOGT, they massively improve on the mission structure. The missions are so much more fun in the DLCs.
Making a small upwards or downwards movement is pretty much impossible.
Yeah nah I don‚Äôt want remasters after the definitive edition debacle, I want the original game it‚Äôs such a classic.. yeah I‚Äôve seriously been debating on going to buy a PC just to play this one game lol
    Every game is just better on PC, you won‚Äôt regret it.
As a complete package, easily GOAT.
Wait‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a  dlc ? I only know it as Liberty city stories‚Ä¶. Guess I know what I‚Äôm buying later today. Is that Lost and Damned storyline  a dlc as well?
    Yup! TBOGT and Lost and Damned were both DLCs for GTAIV. I got mine in a trilogy bundle for PS3 years ago
        Shiieet I remember playing it years ago on my uncle‚Äôs console but then never being able to find a disc version myself. I‚Äôm definitely going to purchase both digitally and replay those bad boys‚Ä¶ Without cheats this time lol
            Idt I ever even tried to play through without cheats until GTAV. It almost felt unnatural to grind out for weapons and ammo lol
Well I guess Tony is gay in it.
    The Ballad of lGbtq Tiny
        What is tiny about him?
            Nothing üòè
                Your screen name oddly gives me confidence that this is true.
        HAHAHAH that is exactly how it would've been called if it came out today.
i feel TLAD was the weaker out of the two DLCs, but was still enjoyable.
    Understandable. It is. But its the only reason I got the complete trilogy edition. I always wanted to play a biker gang game and that was the only one that did it right
        the mechanics were fantastic though! the story was meh to me. i wish some of those mechanics translated to GTAO for their biker update but it wasn‚Äôt stellar. :(
            Yeah. I appreciate that it even got made in the first place because motorcycle club genre arent that popular in the mainstream. Like the Sons of Anarchy show, nobody talks about it.

And yeah i downloaded gta 5 again just for the biker club dlc. The bikes are nice but they didn't put much effort.
Yeah fuck him, one of the most bullshit deaths (especially MC death) ever, Gta V is so badly written.
Trevors the man takes a dump behind a dumpster waiting for a meet with Michael like a boss!
OMG, what a OST dude! I remember driving trought the streets whit Aerosmith "Lord Of The Thighs" playing at the radio!
Tbogt's alot more memorable. base game for plot, tbogt for literally everything else. And yes, missions...shoot em ups here and there, but is actually quite creative with its structure. 2015 me speaking, memory so could be biased.
Yes, you are right TBOGT is the best of these 3. GTA IV has indeed a lot of repetitive missions that can be completed just with a drive-by, while TBOGT has more diverse and memorable missions. But if I remember well there are just 25 main story missions, and TLAD has another 25. For the story you should play first GTAIV, as the stories interconnect at some points, then TLAD then TBoGT. But just for the missions' fun and quality TBoGT is the best of them.
GTA IV FIRST OF COURSE. Or the first cutscene won't make sense at all in TBoGT, also you will not understand the connection the DLC's have to the main story. Because you DO see the main characters from TBoGT and TLAD in IV as Niko, they both cross paths with Niko a few times in IV, I don't wanna spoil the details, just play GTA IV base first.
what versions of GTA 4 can you listen because I have the OG version of the game when it came out.
    Check out PC mods to get back stations that were removed
    The new version in PC, in the Rockstar Launcher. It combines GTA IV with the two DLCs
        Ah man too bad the PS3 versions dont because I hate the GTA 4 music its the worst in the series and the game is 7th gen console.
I  consider merging music from both games disadvantage. Simply because  some stations changed their genres
    They combined the genres like in Vladivostok FM it switches from Russian to House
        Yes, this is  exactly what I said.
If I remember correctly TBGOT didn't have bad ending it had a good or decent ending.  Luis was loyal and never disrepected Gay tony. He stuck up for tony and looked out for him when everyone just wanted a piece of his wealth. Luis can handle himself as good as of the GTA lead characters in the other games.   I can see luis and tony going down to  modern day vice city opening up some of clubs doing what they did before in liberty city.  Or luis goes solo and tony makes an appearance or cameo in the game. He's character that I was surprised was not in GTA V in some way but they bring Johnny to kill him, and packie back but relagate him to henchmen in heists.
Prior to earlier this year I was confused by this, now I've actually played TLAD I hate Trevor even more lol
    I still can't fucking believe they did that to Johnny. It's not canon at all for me. Fuck that's not even Trevor for me. He wouldn't do that, even if it's hos early stage crazy persona, which gradually grows imo. Clay and Terry... Jesus. What a huge slap in the face. If they used Niko instead the fans would revolt.
        Just replayed yesterday actually, and I absolutely agree. Johnny at the end of TLAD would have never let himself and the Lost slip to what they are in 5. He was an actual interesting character, and they just made Trevor out to be the wacky crazy loose cannon.
            Yup it's a cheap shot. Using shock factor to show how "badass" Trevor is. Imagine if Franklin killed CJ! That's no way to treat your fans imo
They‚Äôre huge assholes, but it ended up making them literal billions diverting resources to GTAO. I get it, but it‚Äôs sucks so hard that they‚Äôre rereleasing GTA V again‚Ä¶like why don‚Äôt you add DLC and we‚Äôd buy it in droves before the next GTA VI.

Ah, fuck. I just want GTA VI now, the boat already passed with GTA V DLC
Same with Red Dead
It really is. From the writing to the seamless ways they interweave the narratives between the 3 characters. Never noticed Luis or Johnny in my first playthrough really til the DLC
I just went to IV after playing though VC and SA, I can't get the cars under control on PC, glad you can just take a cab as well.
    I just tried VC DE, so hard to drive in this game after all those years. Therefore I damaged my cars and died 2 times because they explode ridiculously fast once they're on fire. I'm done until a serious update comes.
    Yeah PC GTA 4 driving is bad with mouse and keyboard because I'm guessing it just engages the throttle fully instead of with a controller it's a pressure sensitive trigger.
You‚Äôve got no heart if you even consider doing otherwise. Plus scoring all of Playboy‚Äôs stuff is an added bonus tbh
    Lol a super sweet apartment is definitely a bonus
Brilliant
But look at games that base their whole game around driving like Forza horizon. In horizon the driving feels decently realistic yet it isnt like driving on ice. I'd say it's alot more like gta5 driving
    Horizon is arcady unless you mess withe settings , gta 4‚Äôs handling model had more of a simulation feel to it and it was very satisfying and rewarding, gta 5¬¥s is not bad by any means but just not as rewarding as the 4th‚Äôs
    Gta 4 is not like that either. It only feels like the roads are ice if you try applying GTA SA/5 style driving to it.

If you actually drive carefully and like you would in real life, it's a lot more manageable. Of course you're gonna slide if you're driving 100kmh and turn into a sharp corner with your handbreak
        Exactly! It looks slow, so people think they can just turn around while driving 100km/h.
        What an awful take, literally who plays gta without driving like a maniac?
            Me, you don't need to always press the gas, you can just let it go when you wanna take turns.
            You don't need to drive like a normal citizen, literally just slow down before corners.
        > If you actually drive carefully and like you would in real life, it's a lot more manageable.

but in real life you also dont drive slow and i can instantly see that in gta 4 the car wheels had oil into them and the ground is ice
            > but in real life you also dont drive slow

Wtf are you smoking? You clearly never driven a car lmao. Show me your car that slides through corners at 50+ in NYC traffic.
    The tire spin , suspension travel , damage model were greater
Realistic isn't better.
    tell that to RDR2 & most likely GTA VI (if that's ever confirmed lol)
        Tbf the more realistic parts of rdr2 are either amazing or make the game wayyy more boring, no in between
    In your opinion
Realistic? Just say you never driven a car before.
    Yes, it's the most realistic driving in the entire GTA series so it's a valid point. Actually it's more realistic than even many actual racing games.

    I was expecting to be able to switch between them when you had a wanted level so you could actually have fun using the mechanic against the cops in free roam.
I hated it and consequently never bothered finishing the game.
Not good enough
Well that too I‚Äôve really never let bother myself either
Shiieet I remember playing it years ago on my uncle‚Äôs console but then never being able to find a disc version myself. I‚Äôm definitely going to purchase both digitally and replay those bad boys‚Ä¶ Without cheats this time lol
    Idt I ever even tried to play through without cheats until GTAV. It almost felt unnatural to grind out for weapons and ammo lol
What is tiny about him?
    Nothing üòè
        Your screen name oddly gives me confidence that this is true.
HAHAHAH that is exactly how it would've been called if it came out today.
the mechanics were fantastic though! the story was meh to me. i wish some of those mechanics translated to GTAO for their biker update but it wasn‚Äôt stellar. :(
    Yeah. I appreciate that it even got made in the first place because motorcycle club genre arent that popular in the mainstream. Like the Sons of Anarchy show, nobody talks about it.

And yeah i downloaded gta 5 again just for the biker club dlc. The bikes are nice but they didn't put much effort.
Ah man too bad the PS3 versions dont because I hate the GTA 4 music its the worst in the series and the game is 7th gen console.
Yes, this is  exactly what I said.
Just replayed yesterday actually, and I absolutely agree. Johnny at the end of TLAD would have never let himself and the Lost slip to what they are in 5. He was an actual interesting character, and they just made Trevor out to be the wacky crazy loose cannon.
    Yup it's a cheap shot. Using shock factor to show how "badass" Trevor is. Imagine if Franklin killed CJ! That's no way to treat your fans imo
Exactly! It looks slow, so people think they can just turn around while driving 100km/h.
What an awful take, literally who plays gta without driving like a maniac?
    Me, you don't need to always press the gas, you can just let it go when you wanna take turns.
    You don't need to drive like a normal citizen, literally just slow down before corners.
> If you actually drive carefully and like you would in real life, it's a lot more manageable.

but in real life you also dont drive slow and i can instantly see that in gta 4 the car wheels had oil into them and the ground is ice
    > but in real life you also dont drive slow

Wtf are you smoking? You clearly never driven a car lmao. Show me your car that slides through corners at 50+ in NYC traffic.
Tbf the more realistic parts of rdr2 are either amazing or make the game wayyy more boring, no in between
Driving on buttery roads is now realistic now? You IV fanboys are funny.
    Someone was bad at driving in IV. Git gud.
        Ah yes, the classic "If you don't like it you're just bad at it".
What does V have to do with this? Are IV fanboys so insecure that V is more popular that they bring up when no one else did?
    Do you want to read back through the comments and see what we‚Äôre talking about here. It‚Äôs literally comparing the two
Oh yes because I am the one who brought it up first.
You guys must crashing all the timeS
    Yes because I love the crash physics and the deformation system in the game is insane
        When you roll a cop car over and the siren gets all wonky
            Love that
The driving is one of the best aspects of IV. It has weight. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it takes some skill to master. You can‚Äôt say that about V‚Äôs driving. 

And I like V‚Äôs too but it gets boring when every car controls basically the exact same. At least in IV, I can tell the difference between a sports car and a van, because the game does a far better job of simulating the difference in weight.
