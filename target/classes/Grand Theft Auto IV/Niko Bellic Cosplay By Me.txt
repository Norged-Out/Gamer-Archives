    This guy is 100% a bonafide gopnik.
dress like that again when you at nikos age.
    Aight see you in 2034 üò≠
        Start smoking and drinking really hard, you hit the look 5 years early if you want
            Also war ptsd
                yeah get in the army or something and fight in world war 3 if it happens
                    He could start WW3 to guarantee the aging effect sooner
                    No go to Russia and get real life experience.
Cousin! Let's go bowling
    If you hadn‚Äôt dropped this is totally would have :p
Three stripped Adidas is on point .
Man this outfit is 100/100!
Pretty good cosplay! 

Looks like Niko during his younger days - shortly after the Yugoslavian Wars. 
üëå
Complicated slavic facial expression: check
Awesome! And for a split second I thought that was my face, we are like twins ü§£
That‚Äôs actually pretty good my guy
Yo this is dope!
Nice outcome

Did you find Stephanie that sucks like a vacuum?
Same clothes: Check.
Still looks like a troubled refugee: Check.
Probably does not want to go bowling: Check.

Did you have electricity before the age of 12? :p
Nikos son!
While I don't think this is a very hard cosplay to gear up for; it still does look amazing. Good job.
Nailed it
Sick! Now you just need the receding hairline
Got the alcohol eyes. But not those dead Yugoslavian war eyes.

Nico before life fucked him.
Good Serbian war criminal cosplay
Nicholas Belsnick

Fit is perfect but... Dude you're WAY too young to pull off his face

This picture reminds me of that video by Ortmon

That was some great shit
Where did you find the items to pull this cosplay?
Awesome
Kurwa
Bro, u looks like Jordi
Give it a few more years so your hair recedes and you‚Äôll be perfect.
in the best way possible it looks like you genuinely just casually owned those clothes and just took a picture
It‚Äôs so weird how in the actual game, Niko never wears gloves when he did so in the promos and even on the official artwork. 

Needless, amazing cosplay.
Can you by chance bowl and have a girlfriend named Michelle
Gentlemen take note, this man has his life together. We all must aspire to be as successful and put together as he is, GTA is life.
 ‚ÄúGTA IV had much more realistic graphics‚Äù
Parece que o Paulinho louco

    Start smoking and drinking really hard, you hit the look 5 years early if you want
        Also war ptsd
            yeah get in the army or something and fight in world war 3 if it happens
                He could start WW3 to guarantee the aging effect sooner
                No go to Russia and get real life experience.
