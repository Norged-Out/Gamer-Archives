[[Why exactly do we need to balance the game for the top 1%]]


From what I can tell the balance patches are catered more twords the pros and top 500 than they are twords casual players. To me that makes 0 sense because most of the player base isn't In top 500, most of the player base is in silver and gold.
I get that the pros are the ones who will break your game and will show what the peak of each character is, but most people won't be able to replicate what they do, plus no matter how you balance the game the competitive scene will still be there, so why not make the majority happy?


This. It baffles me when games cater almost exclusively to the top tier players. The bread and butter of any multiplayer game is the casual majority. If they aren't enjoying the game, the game is doomed.
Because they can tune a hero to be strong in the right hands and  allow room for improvement for those learning but not the other way round. I felt the same once but imagine if the heroes were tuned for lower ranked players, what's gonna happen when pros and players with 1000's of hours experience use them, they're gonna absolutely stomp, not much fun for anyone. So they always allow room for improvement.
    Well those pros and people with 1000s of hours are going to be fight other players who are pros and people with 1000s of hours.
Most players don't have that experience, most people won't be able to play genji the same way pros do, so when a new genji plays they shouldn't have to learn all the tech and small details in order to be good as him.
        A new player playing Genji shouldn't be expected to play well. 

A new player should fail. 

A new player should have his ass handed to him. 

After many seasons of asshanding. That new player will pick up tricks. And get better over time. 

That new player will no longer be a new player. But a seasoned player. 

The issue is you're trying to run before you learn to walk. 

Second reason, using your example. If they lower the skill level for Genji. The lower brackets will get a lot worse. Why? Because currently it takes a modicum of skill to Genji smurf and 1v6. Making Genji easier means making smurfing for Genji mains easier.
            I worded it weird, I meant he shouldn't have to learn all the tech right away, it seems like you have to otherwise A. Your team will be super pissed, and B. The enemy team will just dick him since he's not dashing in the right spot or playing optimally right away.
Smurfs are impossible to stop at this point, trying to balance around them would be pointless.
                Smurfs are impossible to stop. You're correct. 

I'm not saying stop smurfs. I'm saying think about what smurfs can do if their characters get buffed/easier to play. 

We have all got to learn somewhere. Quickplay is good. If you hate quickplay and only want to play comp, that's also fine. You'll have people hating on you sure, but

1. Eventually you'll lose enough Sr that you drop to a bracket where your suboptimal plays are still enough to win 50 percent of your games. 

2. Considering that your discussion is revolving low bracket plays, players in low brackets really have no business calling others bad. So just ignore them and tell them they are the same rank as you are.
        You want the devs to design characters so new players can be just as good as professionals immediately? how would that even work at all?

    I'm sure most people know what's strong, they just can't or won't replicate what the pros are doing.
        Bastion is a perfect example. 

Bronze to gold he shreds. 

Diamond and above he gets shredded. 

Plat he's hit and miss 

If you check the top 500 leaderboards, you can see which are the top 3 heroes they play for each role in top 500. 

What you'll notice is there's hardly any bastions. 

I haven't checked it this season. But a couple seasons back when I was trying to check what was meta. I counted 2 bastions in the top 500. 

TWO. 

Yet at the lower brackets you'll hear them say "eww bastion cheese no skill" stuff like that.
            Bastion is definitely a good example of this.  He's super easy to counter but if he doesn't get countered he's super oppressive.  I can kill him 1v1 pretty easily with my main personally.
    That doesn’t mean the game needs to be balanced for top tier players only.
        [removed]
            Agree. If they balance for gold-plat then heroes balanced in top tier now would be ridiculously OP in top tier after the rebalance.
A game needs to balance for both the average player AND the top tier ones, otherwise you will have problems on both ends.

Overwatch unfortunately has put a lot of effort into Esports and viewership, so they balance for the best of the best to improve that viewer experience. I imagine they make a lot more money through Esports than regular players, especially as a lot of viewers of the OWL do not actually play Overwatch, so it makes sense to them to keep that philosophy when it comes to balance.

But the crappy balance and disregard for average players is what made me quit this game in favor of another similar, that does in fact balance for average players. I hardly think I am alone in this decision, at times it was like playing with balance changes for a different game; beyond frustrating. characters that are too powerful were left unaddressed and some still are, characters that are under-performing have yet to receive any meaningful boosts.

I'm hoping Overwatch 2 doesn't focus too hard on the pros, but Blizzard are proven money grubbers and (although they pretend otherwise) don't care about community opinion unless it costs them. I don't hold much hope for decent balance if they plan on keeping an Esports scene or unless something drastic happens.

Which is a real shame because I love this game and it's lore. It could really be something special if some effort and consideration was put in. I've had to watch this game that meant a lot to me decline because of greed, incompetence, short-sightedness and prideful arrogance.
Pros and tops know how to play the game. Silvers and gold- don’t. If they balance around lower ranks higher would abuse some of heroes and THEN we will have a problem.  Take for example Doom- technically he’s easy. But once you understand how to use him you will be like a nightmare to players who don’t know how to counter him. He is super popular pick for smurfs. But as far as i know in higher ranks he’s not popular.
    Silvers and gold's do know how to play, just not against pros and top players. Plus higher ranks already abuse certain heroes, they will find who's the strongest and abuse them, and the other players will adapt. no matter who the game is balanced around pros will do this.
Doomfist is a perfect example, he terrorizes lower ranked games because he has so much shit. But pros can easily deal with him so the overwatch team feels like they have to give him all that shit if he wants to be viable in pro play. Since he's balanced around the top level of play, the lower ranks who have no idea how to play against him suffer because of it.
        As a person who’s plays with silvers, gold, and plat i can say - no, they don’t. People Doing stupid mistakes and play blamegame. Those 3 ranks are easiest to be. Being t500 takes skill and understanding.
            Yes they make mistakes, but so does the enemy team. They know how to play in their skill range, if you compare a silver and a top 500 then clearly you can see one is better than the other, compare two silvers and you will have a hard time seeing who is better than the other.
                We are not comparing players in skill range. We are comparing skill and game understanding. T500 *understand* game. Silver player is not. Hell, I’m doing my plat placements in current moment and each game suck in a different way because people just ignore parts of the game which is critical for winning. 

The real problem is not hero balance, the real problem is smurfing which allows high ranked players who understand game go to lower ranks and abuse hell out of heroes they pick.
                    You are comparing skill and game understanding, I'm comparing skill range. Yes smurfing sucks, but as long as they can buy a new copy of the game it's not going to stop, unless they prevent him from ever buying overwatch again.
So as long as smurfing is impossible to combat, the best we can do is increase the quality of every game where a Smurf isn't present.
                        Skill+game understanding is the key to ranking. 

By all mean, lets ask bronze players for balance advice, why not?
                            They play the game too don't they? Their voice matters too.
                                It's sorta like removing the pointy end of a pen because someone who didn't know how to use it stabbed themselves in the eye with it. You can't balance around people who don't know how to use the tools they're given. People in bronze are just playing for fun or starting out. So when it comes to balance changes I would say that no, their voices don't matter.
Blizzard doesn’t care about this game anymore. Smurf’s run rampant and people throw matches left and right in gold/plat. They don’t care about fixing the issue and it’ll stay that way
    They care, not about the players, not about the game, not about the pro scene, but the money. They are doing the bare minimum to keep this game afloat, just so they can keep making money off of it.
Because the 1% are the people who buy shit.  They don't just buy DLC, they'll buy multiple copies of the game with DLC on each of them.  It's no different in fighting games.
    The 99% are the ones who will buy tickets to watch the 1%. Their the ones who will buy the majority of the merch. Their the ones who will recommend the game to their friends. Their the ones who keep the 1% playing. Without the other 99% the 1% are nothing.
Dude watch literally any streamer or listen to any of the pro players and they’ll bitch and complain the game isn’t patched for them I know people don’t wanna hear this but this game is balanced for about Plat/diamond However they can’t leave things completely unbalanced at the top because if the game is completely unbalanced at the top then pro players and all that stuff disappear and if there’s no top to aim for people don’t want to play alternatively if they balance the game only towards the top then new players get absolutely demolished when they come in because there’s no real balancing at the bottom so it Has to be balanced for somewhere in the middle the problem with that though is anyone above or below that middle area has some things that are slightly unfair because in a game with characters who rely almost completely on their abilities the ability of the player playing that character will determine how useful it is so players at the bottom Who can’t really use their kits very effectively will get demolished by certain characters but those same characters will be basically useless at the top rank
    People will always complain about something they love, cause they want to see it be better. Plus it's just apart of human nature.
If a game is popular enough there will be a pro scene, there will always be something to learn and something you can improve on, even if the game is balanced for a silver.
I do understand this game is impossible to balance properly, no game will ever be perfectly balanced. Clearly they need to look at the top and bottom of the player base since their simply not playing the same game as everyone else, but if the majority of people are is silver and gold, they should try and make the most people happy. I feel like the majority of people who left the game are because of the way they balanced this game, and I feel like they would still be here if they balanced it differently.
They don’t balance off anyone in particular, they look at the stats per hero (but I’m sure they do take actual feedback into mind).
    I'm sure they do,. It at what rank do they consider the most, is it littler Sally who's in bronze trying to play doomfist for the first time, Throck Mortis III who is the best doomfist in the universe who can easily 1 vs 6 even pro teams and can move across the universe with one ability, or do they try and balance the game where the majority of players are.
I'm sure they look at every rank but they have too look in one place in particular when they think about balance.
        Most likely silver gold plat, as the large majority of the player base is in there
            I highly doubt its balanced around them.
                The goal of the game is to make money, odds are it’s balanced around the money makers
                    If their goal is to make money their doing it wrong. The more people playing means more people buying things. More people playing means more people watching the pro scene. More people playing means the more people will recommend the game to their friends.
The goal is to reward good play… I agree that the game could be more fun with dramatic changes for the average player (kinda like the April fools patch but not that dramatic) but this could officially kill the game rather than build it up because of how the game is set up (or at least is trying to be set up) to reward skill over what character is strong.
    At this point you may be right, too late in the games life to do such a drastic change.
I think the game is already tuned for the casual audience. Almost every top level streamer or pro thinks the game balance is horrible.
Because top tier players know how to play the game.
    Everyone knows how to play the game, they just play it differently.
Pretty sure overwatch was always intended for the eSports level of gaming. Therefore the top players, most of which are league players, would involve Jo sponserships, shares, and a variety of other high investments.

That's my thought anyway,  the majority is going to be coming from league related contracts. The game will crumble if they lose the eSports scene.
Well those pros and people with 1000s of hours are going to be fight other players who are pros and people with 1000s of hours.
Most players don't have that experience, most people won't be able to play genji the same way pros do, so when a new genji plays they shouldn't have to learn all the tech and small details in order to be good as him.
    A new player playing Genji shouldn't be expected to play well.

We are not comparing players in skill range. We are comparing skill and game understanding. T500 *understand* game. Silver player is not. Hell, I’m doing my plat placements in current moment and each game suck in a different way because people just ignore parts of the game which is critical for winning. 

The real problem is not hero balance, the real problem is smurfing which allows high ranked players who understand game go to lower ranks and abuse hell out of heroes they pick.
    You are comparing skill and game understanding, I'm comparing skill range. Yes smurfing sucks, but as long as they can buy a new copy of the game it's not going to stop, unless they prevent him from ever buying overwatch again.
So as long as smurfing is impossible to combat, the best we can do is increase the quality of every game where a Smurf isn't present.
        Skill+game understanding is the key to ranking. 

By all mean, lets ask bronze players for balance advice, why not?
            They play the game too don't they? Their voice matters too.
                It's sorta like removing the pointy end of a pen because someone who didn't know how to use it stabbed themselves in the eye with it. You can't balance around people who don't know how to use the tools they're given. People in bronze are just playing for fun or starting out. So when it comes to balance changes I would say that no, their voices don't matter.
The goal of the game is to make money, odds are it’s balanced around the money makers
    If their goal is to make money their doing it wrong. The more people playing means more people buying things. More people playing means more people watching the pro scene. More people playing means the more people will recommend the game to their friends.
