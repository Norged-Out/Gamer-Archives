[[State of the Overwatch League right now]]





That is how OWL has always been...patch releases then the teams all race to find what the best composition is...then they play it for a bit until a team breaks that composition (like with the gladiators in the kick off clash) or it gets patched out (like the JOATS meta in the summer showdown). 

The best times are watching teams trying to figure out the meta composition or when a team breaks the meta composition and that happened fairly frequently this season actually lol
    Why don't they give teams bans like in moba games? Like, 1-2 bans per team and map and it should be sufficient to shake things up regularly.
        Don't have a 100% correct answer for this but in my opinion, I think we are slowly going to get into that state...I think the thing holding them back is the lack of heroes to pick from. There are 100+ ~~heroes~~ champions in those MOBAs but in overwatch we have 35. I think it will be more viable to have pick/ban system after we get like 50+ heroes.

Also, there have been tournaments with pick/ban systems in OW1 but people have picked and ban around the meta because they are good at the meta so it isn't a 100% deterrence from the meta BUT, I think it will definitely help.
            Is issue isn't the number of heroes, but the fact that switching heroes mid-match is part of the core gameplay.

In MOBAs, it doesn't matter really how many you ban, because there will always at least be enough for all 10 players.
                Agree with you on this but I'd add it to my point.
                > but the fact that switching heroes mid-match is part of the core gameplay.

That may have been their intention, but it really isn't—at least not in OWL.
                    Well they haven’t done anything to incentivize it… they even removed open role queue for a while
                    Exactly. Ideally you pick strong generalist heroes that don't require swapping so that your players can specialize and master 1 hero instead of 10. You also never risk losing any ult charge.
                        The idea of Overwatch was for there to not be mains and that you should swap to counter the enemy,

The problem was the 50 players trying to play Genji and get very offended when asked to swap when they're underperforming (because the enemy team has Winston/Zarya/Symmetra/Mei/Moira/Brig)
                            The game can be very weird in that dropping your main isn't always the best choice because your performance may actually go DOWN in an attempt to counterpick.

For example, I play a lot of Junkrat and regularly see people swap to Pharah to try and "counter" me but they often have very little playtime on her and get killed even more easily than before. Usually because they'll go too deep in order to try and kill me.

Hero swapping has always looked cool on paper but been incredibly hard to actually accomplish. The best counter isn't always a hero that you're good at.
                                But sometimes you can achieve it with bare minimum of the counter pick.

And it's still better to at least try rather than to be bitter about it. Then again, it depends on the hero. If a Reaper is destroying our backlines I will still try to either take Cass to take him out, or Reaper/Genji myself to fuck up his backlines. If the enemy is playing an oppressive Dva, I'll go Zarya because just bare minimum effort from Zarya can tear her down.

But if the enemy team has a really good Cassidy, yeah, not much I can do since he fucks up almost anyone in a 1v1. A good counter for him would be a sniper but my aim sucks, but I still try to play Widow against him.

Another thing is, the game kinda forces a 50% winrate (or better yet, 33% near-guaranteed wins, 33% near-guaranteed losses, 33% games that you can somewhat tip in your favor), so even if you try to counter them your team will still not coordinate with you or help you out.

Always try to counter the team, I mean if seems like you're bound to lose, there's nothing to lose so try to take out their strongest player with their counter.

One of my most memorable moments of OW1 (comp) was when a Widowmaker was destroying us, so I begged one of our tanks (the one that was actually reading the chat and the only one communicating, they were playing good otherwise) to go Winston instead of Orisa, they said "BUT I'M YOUR ONLY SHIELD" and it took some convincing like "we won't need a shield if you contest that widow", then they said "but I almost never play Winston!" and after some yapping they reluctantly swapped, and then proceeded to asshammer that Widow for the rest of the match and she never even swapped. Then I praised the Winston for carrying us and they were so happy about it.
                                    Sometimes? Yes. Often? No.

It's impossible to play on equal footing with all heroes and not every hero has an accessible hard counter.
                Switching heroes mid match is not a part of the core gameplay at this level, for the simple reason that it don't happen.

I prefer no switching heroes and a diverse meta rater than no switching heroes and a boring mirror comp meta.
                Even if each team got 1 ban per class (tank, dps, support) and said bans applied to both team's rosters, making for a grand total of 6 bans I feel like that'd greatly help diversify the team comps we see.  And just 6 bans, equally distributed among the 3 classes still leaves the teams with a lot of freedom for switching heroes mid-game to address whatever the current need is.
                    I agree. Imo mirror matchups in a game with skills just are not that interesting, I want to see how they counter enemy formation in not ideal conditions.

I also don't care that they wouldn't be able to master 1-2 heroes, I want a spectacle, not the most efficient matchup.
                        A game based around rapid swapping like ow would not work with locks like that though
                            Why not? They would still have 30 heroes available.
                                Because the individual pools for things like tank and healers are fairly small and not being able to counter or swap to some heroes whilst the enemy team can use them would be dodgy.

You can swap heroes mid game, so unless both teams have access to the same picks, it’d be unbalanced.
                                    Yes, it would be unbalanced, but the idea behind bans is to unbalance it for the other team while still being able to counter whatever they will pick based on current meta. It is not about ideal balance, it is about outplaying your opponent.

3 bans should not be that disrupting (1 per role). Maybe next year, when they have more tanks/supports? They probably won't do it anyway, but I firmly believe it would make it more fun to watch (I don't think it's needed in regular comps).
                                    I specified that the 6 total bans would apply to *both* teams' rosters.  There wouldn't be an instance where one team swaps to a hero that the other can't access.
                    > And just 6 bans, equally distributed among the 3 classes

For them to be equally distributed in **impact**, it'd need to be 1 tank, 2 damage and 0 support bans, though.
                        Yeah sure, something along those lines would be fine too.  I'm just spitballing here so the total number of bans and how many bans each particular class get would be something interesting to explore.
                    So how would that not lead to seeing mirror matches of the 7th through 11th best heroes?
                        Ideally if teams ban the typical top performers for each role, who individually tend to be capable of performing what several other heroes can do, that'd open up some variability.  For example if Sojourn is banned, maybe one team who really values her for her ability to delete squishies from a distance will replace her with Widow Maker while another team who valued her for her extreme mobility will replace her with a Genji.

I feel like one of the issues with the top picks right now is that it stems from some heroes being able to do too much.  So instead of having to choose to we want to pick the hero who can do X really well or the hero who does Y, they get funneled into picking the hero can can do X, Y, *and hell, even Z* really well and from there they're also forced to pick heroes who can both synergize with that said hero and can serve as a counter since the enemy team is going to pick them too.  Give teams the ability to ban and hopefully that'll result in them having to mix things up a bit.
                I sometimes wonder if allowing players to switch mid-match is part of what makes teams all use the same comp.

Most team compositions have strengths and weaknesses. But if the enemy team can switch heroes at any time, then obviously they are going to exploit your team's weaknesses - every time.  So then, the only option is to pick the most bland comp, with no significant weakness to exploit (and probably no particular strengths either, because there is some balance in the heroes).

                    OW4 being a battle royal was a hot mess.
            > I think it will be more viable to have pick/ban system after we get like 50+ heroes.

How many years away are we from 50 heroes?
                It'll be 2030 and each hero will need to be purchased for 20$. Some of the pros will be forced to find new comps to fit around certain team members not owning and having paid for that character.
                    2030 and our accounts are gonna be so valuable because we have half the dps and all 8 healers unlocked from being a legacy player
                        and we'll be getting all hyped up for the Final Pre-release PVE Beta!
                    Don't forget, it'll be Overwatch 3/4 by then too, and competitive, any new gamemodes, and maybe even parts of the maps will probably be sold as extras!
                        There is no more game modes. It's just a custom streaming client you can use to watch pros play, but you got to pay each hero or you won't be able to see what a player using that hero is doing.

            >Also, there have been tournaments with pick/ban systems in OW1 but people have picked and ban around the meta because they are good at the meta so it isn't a 100% deterrence from the meta BUT, I think it will definitely help.

~~People pick ban around the meta in MOBAs too.~~ People pick/ban around the meta in any esport.
            Paladins had banning in ranked even when they had 30 characters, now they have over 50, and increased it from 4 bans (2 for each team) to 6 bans, 3 per team. It works great, cause everyone is in accordance and bans the brain dead annoying characters that require no skill which makes the game much more fun and skilled overall. Bans would be good for ranked, idk about OWL since it’s just metas in there. Ranked actually uses most characters, but I am so down to not have to play brain dead characters like Rat.
        I think it would largely end up being the same. Everyone bans the same couple things each time and then you just pick the best of what's still available.
            Yeah, there isnt a deep enough pool of heroes to make bans interesting. 

Plus, if everyone just bans 2 supports then oof.
                Can only ban one support. Wow that was easy.
                    You are still banning 25% of the support roster, though. 

Like, bans would be cool, if we had more heroes.
                        ??? 12.5%.
                            Each side gets one support ban
                                Why? Who says? Just allow 1 support ban max.
                                    Because there are two teams. Also I say since this shit is made up anyway. You tried to correct the person above you and are now digging your heels in when I clarified his reasoning
                            Both sides ban one
                        I said this in another comment, but **actually** balanced bans would need to be 1 tank, 2-3 damage and 0 support, *per team*.

This would try to presence the relative impact each ban has, given the size and variety of each roster.
            That's what happens in R6S. Everyone bans Clash and the rest of the bans are just annoying coz now you cant play your main.
                Exactly, I get why people might think bans would help, but overall I think it would just be more annoying.
                    It would be interesting if the system made you ban one hero out of tank, support, or dps - and that decision is random
                        This did actually happen for a few weeks way back in 2018 just after the addition of role lock
                Btw we wan't pick and bans for OWL, not your usual ranked games.
            Yeah. I would love hard meta over powered characters to be banned every game. Allows for variety and not just the same comp every game like OWL. We ain’t getting paid to use the same character for ever. Have some fun with comps.
            It'd give them the option to show something cool. In MOBA games, bans and picks are situational, and it is much more entertaining than mirror matches
        Cause then we’d just get “Teams keep banning the same hero’s over and over.” Posts.
            Not necessarily. They will ban here and there heroes where enemy is known to be really good at, and the other team can ban some counters to their strategy.

In ideal world, they should not allow same picks , but I understand that hero switching doesn't really work with it (not that people in OWL use it anyway).
        Same reason you can't ban guns in tac shooters. Both can play same.
        Teams are good at the current meta, they are not as good at anything else. They'd rather ban counters to the meta most of the time. This is partly a consequence of Blizzard not putting out remotely enough heroes since Overwatch launched. When you reach around 50 characters is when you hit critical mass of having to actually engage with the ban system.
            They cant balance the current heroes in a timely manner, I wouldnt trust them with more
                They *can* balance them in a timely manner, they just don't want to for whatever reason. It's not like it actually takes them months to go and change a 4 to a 3 in the code.
                    Yeah, I've never understood why they let things go as long as they do. They typically only want to balance in between seasons and sometimes mid-season. It wouldn't be so bad if they were transparent about their reasons, but they never are.

If they were like, "We know Zarya feels oppressive right now but internal stats show that her damage output and win percentage are in line with similar tanks. Here is a spreadsheet of our numbers. We will continue to monitor for any change that match player anecdotes."
        I love me some bans honestly.
        Two heroes of each role (4 for dps) are locked each round, a single hero can't be chosen twice in a row, and those locked heroes are the same for both teams
        I have an idea a few months ago and is pretty simple: 

You can only use a hero 2 games out 5. You need to win 3 games and at least will be 3-5 games per match so you have have at least 2 to 3 set of heroes and be good at it! In a game you can change to whatever hero but the hero with 51% of usage on that game will be enough to have 1 use and you can only use it one more time in one more game, then is ban for the rest of the match..
        There should be hero bans for sure. Would really lift the variety and counter play of the game.

The issue could be that certain heroes are consistently banned. Maybe the roster needs to be slightly larger first
        I love OWL but I wouldn't expect logic. They decided on a format where a team can lose the match but still have to play another map anyway. People at blizzard had meetings about the format of OWL, it was discussed at length by a group of people, multiple times, and that is the conclusion they came to.
        I agree! But Teams will just ban the strongest of the meta. For example team 1 will just ban kiriko and team 2 will just ban sojourn. Then teams will just pick around the bans and will still result to repetitive compositions. That even happens in MOBAs even with upto 5 bans per team. Meta is meta for a reason and they are playing to win.  Ofcourse they will always pick the best comp to win. And unlike MOBAs, both OW teams can pick the exact same comp resulting to a mirror match.
        Bans are more relevant when there’s actually counterpicks. The new direction overwatch is going is to have less hard counters, which subsequently will mean any meta picks won’t really have answers to shut them down.. and I suspect compositions will be become even more homogenized than in OW1. Sad, really. They didn’t need to change the direction of the game or rework a bunch of shit just to call it a sequel- they just needed to keep adding maps, modes, and heroes to the original.
        I think they should allow independent bans (e.g. each team can ban a hero for the opposing team but can pick them themselves). I understand that OW doesn't have enough heroes for fully non-overlapping picks, but mirror matchups are as boring as they go.
    the fuck is "JOATS"
        Goats with junker queen I presume
            Yea it played very closely to GOATS but the comp was actually (Junker Queen, Sojourn/Ashe, Genji, Lucio, and Brig).
        Jeans + GOATS
    They should prevent mirror games somehow. Give different pools of heroes to each team. They should pick their heroes one by one and maybe ban some heroes too.
        They tried something last year called hero pools were the most played hero in a previous stage was banned. Some people in the community loved it, some hated it. But I described in a previous comment that I personally think we will get to a pick/ban system. Just right now, there aren't that many heroes.
        While that may be more entertaining it would be much less competitive that way.
    It has not always been this bad. Sometimes, yes, but almost always there have been at least one or two slots that would shift from team to team. Complete and constant mirror comps like this weren’t a thing back when I was watching.
        Yea I'm an OG OW esports fan and the meta would develop slowly into mirror matchups in the past. You probably watched during those periods of meta development. 

For this playoffs they are actually playing on the November 15th Patch we are getting soon and according some people, they believe the teams haven't had enough time to digest the patch so they are running the best comp they can find at the moment without time to experiment really and break the meta comp. They had 5 days to prepare which isn't great lmao.
    And that's why I stopped watching it. I figured it'd be fun to watch a bit of pro games.

Ended up watching 2 matches of pirate ship and was bored and uninterested. 

Basically, came down to which team was better with the cheese.
        Yea I mean tbh it all comes down to what meta you enjoy watching. For me, I hated JOATS sooo much. I thought it was braindead (that was a very rigid meta). 

I enjoy this new one more (which is also a somewhat rigid meta that doesn't have a name).

People will enjoy different things...I generally enjoy OW esports cause I like seeing people play the game at it's peak but i don't enjoy metas hanging around for 6+ months. from August to now, we have had 3 rigid metas (JOATS -> Zarya Rush -> Winston Rush). So I am generally happy. 

In April, the meta was rigid until the gladiators broke it at playoffs and in mid-season madness we had the most fluid meta ever...people say that was the greatest OW tournament which I agree with.

But yea I get why people might not enjoy it if it was toooo cheesy.
    Right? This is every single season of OW. One team figures out which composition gets the most value for the least effort and then everyone copies them. There's no reason not to do things that way unless there are more frequent balance changes, which they rarely implement during a season anyway.
    Except 5v5 is boring as fuck and makes a more static meta
        WRONG
        RIGHT
    why do ppl get so mad about this ? when you watch real sports every1 is playing human with no skills, same skin with a dif number  and they have almost the same stats. smh
seems i have to edit this since ppl clearly dont get a joke or sarcasm...yikes
        People get mad/disappointed because this game has 35 characters in it. It's lame to see the same 5 every single match
            i guess thats personal opinion, i pretty much prefer a small roster than having league model where they pump a new character every 1-2 months that is broken as hell. balance is also a pain in the ass with so many characters
            Haha which is entirely fair some metas are better than others *depending on what you enjoy watching lol.

Edit*
        I'm confused. When playing sports each person has entirely different sets of skills. They are playing the same sports and are all human, but they have very different strengths and weaknesses in their game. Your comment makes me think you know nothing about physical competition.
            bro it was a joke...chill
        This is more like if every single play in football was a forward pass.
    Heroes can only be used once per map.
WE NEED COMPETITVE MYSTERY HEROES
    I'd never play anything else tbh
        I usually only play mystery heroes already
    It would probably be the least toxic comp mode as well, since you can just blame RNG anytime you lose.
        Or itd be a double down of toxicity and youd get the jackasses that get genuinely, day-ruining pissed off at mario party.
        You'd get flamed if you didn't suicide until you got a 'meta comp', and then if they fixed that, flamed if you didn't suicide before dying to keep it.
        Genjis would still say 'support diff'. They always do.
    Role queue mystery heroes. You get a random hero from that category
        I would counter this with players would have to learn the art of throwing a death to swap characters. I played mystery heroes with a full team before and it's definitely a playable strat.
    ^^^THIS IS THE BEST IDEA RIGHT HERE
    seconded. but with all tanks having -20% HP pls.
        I could get with tanks having a little less hp
    Only if it's role locked
        No way, there's an art to it
        No way, there's an art to it
    I would love for mystery heroes to be more like ARAM in MOBAs where you stay the character you rolled. Only being able to ult every third match or so is killing the fun for me.
    Ah yes, mystery heroes, where the team that happens to roll the most tanks and healers wins. Truly the height of balanced competition. XD
In fairness people were complaining about every game being Zarya, genji, Sojourn, Lucio, and Bap like 4 days ago
    I think people, and especially newcommers, just want to see different heroes, different comp,  and why not some mid game swap.

Why play a hero shooter with more than 35 character if it's to play only 5 of them...
        I was mostly being flippant, I agree that constant mirror comps is probably bad for the pro scene, even if it’s totally rational for pros to do it.
        Ez. Heroes can only be used once per map.
            Honestly id be more interested in pro 5v5 elimination than mirror matchups

The game has the unique feature of hero swapping but its rarely used. Mobas are more interesting bc each team is forced to have a different strategy (or one team has heroes  that are better, like one scaling comp scales better in comparison)
        cuz out of the 35 heroes and each role specifically there are some that played at such high skill that they are a bit better so this players that really want to win will pick the best possible team comp.
they prob also have to practice it in skirmish and stuff so its not like they will just swap to test something in the mid of the competition
            Yup, but some heroes could just be a bit better because of the difference between attack or defense, or for some specific map (or a portion of it) in which one hero shine more than others, etc.

I'm really skeptical about mirror comp, I'm sure it's the right thing to do for pros, but to make an e-sport attractive in the long run it seems terrible.

If it can't be address by balance changes, let's introduce a pick and ban system with no mirror allowed. It would at least spice things up a little bit.
                1. Hero pools and bans have been tried in different levels of play and typically don’t work too well. (The only time it’s worked is when 1 hero is extremely busted cough launch brig cough)

2. Pick and ban with no mirror, my team picks first we get Lucio and we just won, okay Lucio is banned we pick sojourn and we just won again.    
In other games you have a large enough roster for this, in Overwatch well only 1 hero has a constant team speed boost, only 1 hero has constant anti heals. It just doesn’t work yet
                    If the team that get one specific hero first has just won then the balance of the game is simply busted, and will never be fixed no matter the number of heroes.

I'm clearly not convinced, don't forget that the pick and ban process can take many form. With many different restrictions and order. I think it could be balanced. 

If anyone has any idea to make the pro scene something else than mirror matchups I'll be glad to hear more.
                    If picking one hero means winning the game expose how badly balance it is rather than the pick/ban phase being the problem
                        The game is very poorly balanced when it comes to OWL, posts have been popping up showing 3 hero’s have over 97% play rate and I know Lucio has 100% 

This doesn’t happen in ranked, in ranked any 1 trick can hit rank 1 

It’s just a matter of who do you balance the game around
                    Let's hope that they reach the amount of heroes to allow that relatively soon.

Honestly, mirror matches are just boring, no interesting strategic plays at all.
            kinda sucks tho. wish owl had  a faker moment where he pulls Ryze the worst champion in the game and dominates
        Not to mention all this talk about "Overwatch is about hero swapping and picking what you need!" and then see the same 5 characters every game.

People use the hero swapping as an argument against bans, but why does it matter when nobody ever swaps anyway?
            Well it don't, this argument is simply not valid.
        Because that’s how metas work, play the consistently best comp.
            The problem is not that pros play the best comp, but that the best comp is a boring mirror matchups. It's a game design problem, that devs (and not players) need to adress.

There is a meta in LoL too, but there is also diversity, some possibility to surprise people with a pick, etc.. To make OWL an interesting esport to watch, rules of the game need to change.
        There will always be certain heroes at the top of the meta, and they will be played to death in the competitive scene. That's how it is in every competitive game, and that's how it will always be. Eventually a team discovers something new, or it gets patched, but until then everyone will continue to play whatever is deemed as the best.
            We know that pro players just play the best of the best at the top elo, it's not the problem.

The problem is that the best of the best is a 5 hero mirror matchup, no matter the game mode, the map or it's side, or player ability. It's just bad game design for an e-sport. 

It's absolutely boring to know that every match of the playoffs up to the finals will be the same compo of Winston, Sojourn, Reaper, Kiriko, Lucio. Every thing just look and feel the same, it's bad. (We're far from the LoL top meta here) 

Add to that that all team have generic names instead of the famous e-sport clubs we all know from other competitive scenes, and we don't even have time to know players and teams before just being bored of watching the same thing.

Add a pick and ban system, no mirror allowed, and it's done : the OWL is more interesting and diverse.
                I fully agree. I just watched DotA TI and now tuned for OWL and it is such a snooze fest.

I feel like the game is optimized for pros, but I want a spectacle, some big brain moves, out of the box counters, very diverse approaches, etc. But right now mirror comp makes the most sense, I can't blame them.
            “That’s how it is in every competitive game”. Wrong, want an example? The International for Dota just ended and out of 123 characters only 8 weren’t picked or banned. It’s not the same genre yes but you can easily put a ban phase for 3 heroes (one per class) and still have a decent enough hero pool for a match
        its one of the reasons why I really don't understand who likes OWL...
More then likely if you love a off meta hero or something that's average when it comes to power your not even going to see anything cool with it in OWL.
        >Why play a hero shooter with more than 35 character if it's to play only 5 of them...

Because a lot of the people getting on board lately don't *really* want a team-based shooter, they want a downright shooter.
            Well considering what I see in my games it's not true. The fact that some are more popular or more meta doesn't mean that people don't care of hero diversity. In fact it's rare for people to never change heroes for a whole match.

And we can't adress OWL and our casual rank match as if it were the same thing. So a bit off-topic.
    Yeah I’m surprised how fast it changed. It’s a good sign.
>Right now

OWL has always been like this. Teams will choose the strongest meta. Sometimes you get 2-3 heroes that can be swapped in on different maps, but having multiple distinct compositions get regularly picked during a single stage is rare. What solution do you propose?
    Independent bans (like you can use the banned hero, but the enemy team can't), and force teams to have unique bans.

1 ban per tank/DPS/support and that's it, every match will be at least somewhat different.
    Balance the game for rock paper scissors as it was designed to be
I think it's weird that we're supposed to counter pick the enemy team in ranked but the pros only play mirror matches. Why doesn't counterpicking work at the pro level?
    Because the “counter picking “ part already happened in scrims when teams were figuring out the meta. There’s always going to be a best comp to play so the teams will play that. It’s easier to mirror what a team is doing and try and perfect the gameplay to beat them rather than experiment since you only got so much team to practice and scrim. 

Us regular players are able to “counter pick” a bit more easily because we are just normal players and one might know how to counter a comp while the other team doesn’t know how to react in time + they are prob flaming each other because they are randoms and are losing.
        [it's never been nearly as bad as now](https://twitter.com/PRE_owl/status/1587510063903768594?s=20&t=sCLfMvor4Ae5fd7H0aYVxQ)

It might just be playing something safe since the meta hasn't had much time to develop, especially on their patch
    The teams basically played on that patch in a bubble against each other while preparing for playoffs over and over again. What you see now is the final result of endless counter picking. The meta comp.
        So if the best counter to a hero is that same hero, then there is no counter, just skills gaps and broken heroes. Pretty lame if you ask me for a game that prides itself on the notion of counter picking. 

Why does sojurn not have a counter?
        which is a fine example of why the forced 2-2-2 (now 1-2-2) meta was a ridiculous idea 4 years after instating it in the game.  Game should still be 100% open Q

Would this still lead to a preferred meta? Sure, but after watching over 1 decade of starcraft 1 and 2, seeing the meta get rethought every few months was exhilarating and one style never sat around too long in the pro scene before blozz would tweak some stats.  Then again, blizzard balanced and cared about starcraft.  Overwatch 2 just seems like continually adding new and more powerful heroes than the last ones added.
            No thanks. Role Q was by far the best change to the Game.

I like not Watching goats and having more than 1 non-dps hero on my team regularly.
                sure, and the trade off means a lower skill ceiling and less overall meta options in competitive play.
    What really is the counter pick for this composition?
        Unplug the enemy team's computers
            They can't stop you from grabbing a bat and smashing their equipment.
        The funny thing is that both teams are countering each other's Winston with Reaper. So there is *a* counter, it's just mirrored.
            And Winston is picked to counter Sojourn.
                And Sojourn is picked to counter enemy heads.
                    I was really surprised that Widow wasn't more popular in OWL.

In optimized play where the goal is for everyone to play as perfectly as an aimbot would, wouldn't Widow be the natural pick for her infinite range oneshot?

I could understand in ow1 where it'd be physically impossible to get kills past shields, but now as well?
                        You can get those same widow kills with sojourn without being limited to long range and with better alternate abilities
                            So in ow1, it really was just shields that stopped owl players from playing widow?
                                No, widowmaker is a sitting duck, and in all practicality a throw pick in 90% of instances. 

Why play widow if genji or Winston will be picked? Or hanzo? 


Now with sojourn, widowmaker fills no niche. She is the inferior selection in every case, soloqueue or in coordinated play.
                        Depending on the map, attackers have picked widow to try for a grapple hook -> head shot out of spawn before Switching to sojourn in the play offs.
        I feel like dva would play, she tends to eat the monkey and can dive healers?
            Except the support comp is Lucio and kiriko, good luck catching up to them lol
    For pro teams is easier to just find a solid composition and mirror because, talking about the current meta, you have a monkey to go in and kill the supports in the back, a reaper to melt the tank (in particular Winston), Sojurn because Sojurn, kiriko to follow Winston and her ult is amazing with reaper, Lucio because it's a solid pick at high levels and his ult is a rly good counter to engages. 

Now this comp is a solid comp but if they start switching they have to all die to fully switch the comp because if they only switch 1 or 2 to "counter" the comp stops "making sense" and a full wipe is always a big risk. 

Mirror comp it's just about pure skill since they all are using the same heros
    Ults and tempo is too strong basically. Having to go all the way back to base, swap heroes, and restart building ult is expensive when things are so optimized.
        I don't think you walk back to base, you just counter pick when you inevitably die.
            If you die in pro leagues it's usually because you lost a teamfight. In that fight, you were also trying to kill them and you got ult charge, so you'd be giving that up while they're almost at their ults from the first teamfight
    Maybe an upopular opinion but I don't think counter picking works in ranked either. Play the hero you know best. You will almost always get more value out of your main and maybe one off pick if you get hard countered. I just started doing that as a tank and have climbed from high bronze to low gold in like a week.
        Something weird happened to me last night. I was trying to learn Widowmaker, but their Tracer kept killing me, and my team wasn't doing well. Then I switched to my main DPS Junker Rat who I'm very good with, and we started demolishing them. It's almost like their counter pick lost them the game.
Here’s my OWL rant:

Aside from the same heroes every round, I don’t understand how anyone can follow what’s going on, other than one team gets a pick or two and wins the fight. 

The camera and perspectives change so quickly that I can’t even comprehend which team and player I’m looking at before the next switch.  

I can’t follow the actions of 10 players at once, who are all mirrored heroes playing at extreme speeds, with huge amounts of effects and colors, while multiple people struggle to say something of value.
    > Aside from the same heroes every round, I don’t understand how anyone can follow what’s going on, other than one team gets a pick or two and wins the fight.

This has always been the biggest issue with Overwatch as an e-Sport. It's just difficult to watch and understand if you don't watch the pro scene a lot. This meta isn't great as far as spectating, but it's also far from the worst OWL has had. Even if you do watch it a lot, there is always stuff that gets missed due to the pace of the game.

It's come up with observers and casters before, but the vast majority of them have said that OW is one of the most difficult games to cast and observe. There is just so much going on so quickly that some stuff is going to be missed.
        This is exactly the reason why CS:GO has so many regular viewers. Its e-Sport scene is very approachable, even for people who never play a video game.

Players shoot guns, throw grenades, buy more and repeat.
            Imo CS is way too slow for me to get into, same with Valorant

But at the same time OW is nigh incomprehensible from a visual perspective
        I mean you miss a lot in football but you understand where the ball is at least and I think thats the issue. The objective needs to be very clear and the way they get there too.
            Most of the time, the objective isn't even the 2nd most important thing happening.
        Why not at least have a minimap?  The functionality is already there, they just need to find a way to display it.
            Would that really help? The issue with spectating isn't in the pre-teamfight setup. The staging before a teamfight is pretty clear. The issue is during a teamfight when all the particle effects let loose and you have 10 players all stacked right on top of each other. A minimap isn't really going to help with team fight clarity.
                When Winston jumps, it's nice to know who he's jumping to and where the rest of their team is.  A minimap would show how the rest of the team is responding to what's immediately on screen.

They spend a lot of time on dps cam watching them chase one or two kills.  While that's happening, I have no idea how the rest of the teamfight is going except for the healthbars, which don't tell me who is shooting whom from where.
            Youtube compression on OWL streams are so shit you will barely be able to make out what's what with a minimap in the corner. 

Now if they go back to Twitch, and have a main stream + a minimap stream, that would be nice.
                Maybe I am misremembering but didn't they for a time have the option on twitch to select one player perspective to follow on a side stream?
                    Yes, back in 2019.
    >Aside from the same heroes every round, I don’t understand how anyone can follow what’s going on, other than one team gets a pick or two and wins the fight.

IMO, it has always been his main issue.

OW is quite fun to play and may be to watch if you're watching a streamer but for an e-sport, it's messy as fuck.
        When they were on twitch they had that FP POV where you could swap between players. That made it so much more bearable to watch for me since I'd just watch heroes I liked without trying to take in a full 6v6 fight all at once.

Until they bring that back idk if I really enjoy watching it. Shit happens so fast I spent most of the time watching the kill feed.
        Yeah, I think MOBA games are miserable to play , but are really fun to watch, meanwhile OW is super fun to play but pretty awful to watch.
    OW is easily one of the worst spectator games and I'm astonished Blizzard thought it was a good idea to make this big push with it a few years back. Like I play this game and even I will have no clue what the hell is really going on.
        I unfortunately agree. It’s such a cluster fuck and it’s really hard to tell who’s on what team. Especially when both teams are the samw
        Same
        So what about those of us who can tell whats going on? I have no trouble keeping up so I dont get these assertions.
            Congrats?
                I was waiting for a response like this. I guess theres no response to people who make statements like the person i responded to.
                    What reply did you want? Did you want someone to call you a liar? Or perhaps try to fight you on your statement? No one is saying it's impossible to keep up with whats going on, or that there is no one on the planet that can. Was just a comment on how it's extremely messy to follow for the vast majority of people, which it is. I dont think casters saying that it's hard to follow can be taken lightly, when most of them have done multiple different e-sports.
                        Lmao. People find football hard to follow too. Its about competence. messy to follow? Dont watch then. The casters also said goats was a great meta. They just say whatever.
    The more you play in a competitive team setting the more you understand what’s going on in OWL. It’s definitely confusing to watch but you figure it out after a while.
    Yeah. I've never seen OWL before but decided to take a look yesterday.

Not even meth could make my mind fast enough to keep up. It's certainly impressive, but also incomprehensible.

Are the players tested for Adderall or other drugs?
        Its easier to keep track when you're actually playing and fully focused rather than just watching
            Also, the shifting perspectives makes it harder to tell what's happening. Of course, they can't just leave it on one player's POV for the whole match, but if they did, it'd be easier to follow, albeit less interesting.
            Actually the complete opposite of sc2.

This was the game blizzard went full eSports on?
        And it's toned down with just 5v5. Although 6v6 was a shield fest until it was ultimate popping time
        I'm fairly certain if they have a prescription and don't abuse it then they are fine. It's an open secret in many esports, especially shooters, so maybe it's a don't ask don't tell type of deal too. It wasn't until a player leaked that most CSGO pros were on Adderall and gained media attraction that something was done.
    100% agree. OW is a horrible e-sport. Blizz should have kept OW casual and focused their e-sports money on Hots, Sc2 and maybe wow arena.
    I’ve never seen it so perfectly summarized
    A mini map will help to follow a bit easier especially for flank but no idea why they don’t do it
The state of the overwatch league since always
    Yeah, I stopped watching when dive became meta. Watching 12 players smash into each other for 15 seconds at a time wasn't all that great to watch.
at least Winston is in
This is why I stopped watching it. It’s the same group of hero’s each match. It gets boring..
OWL is the most boring esports competition honestly, theres 0 personality in everyone using the same hero and teams called after states insted of the old Esports Teams. I dont even know why they switched from the worldwide esports system to a regionalized USA system, i think CoD did the same back then
    Is there a reason why big organizations like T1, faze, 100T, etc. are not in the leagues? A new player here and i don't recognize any of the teams.
        because overwatch league is a blizzard run league. Not an open invite to anyone wanting to make a team. So the owner of a team might be one of those orgs but the name and stuff was set by Blizzard
        OWL decided to implement a city based League more in line with traditional sports, most of them are run by the big esports brands.
            Call of Duty ended up taking the same approach when the league became franchised going into Modern Warfare 2019. So teams for CoD such as EnVy (Dallas Fuel for OWL) named themselves Dallas Empire which is (now OpTic Texas with the merger of EnVy & OpTic last year) OpTic under Immortals Gaming Club was named LA OpTic (if I remember) FaZe is Alanta FaZe. NRG was Chicago Huntsmen and so forth.
            That has been conned into buying their spot and regret every second of it.
                Which team did you buy?
                    [Just leaving this here.](https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-and-cod-franchises-reportedly-owe-activision-blizzard-up-to-dollar420-million/)

They were promised that OWL would rival the best esport on the planet and turns out it's a monumental fiasco.

To be fair they did trust the company that thought they could rival LoL in less than a year with Heroes of the Storm.
        As far as i know, a while back some games regionalized/signed a contract with US to represent different states. However, CoD league still uses their previous OG team branding like "Atlanta FaZe".

Dont know what happened with OW in particular but these teams i think were previous big organizations that were replaced with region organizations, but right now after 5 years theres no representation from this OG organizations on the league
        FaZe I think technically might be in the league. I assume the large company that owns Atlanta Reign also owns FaZe since FaZe has the Atlanta spot for Call of Duty.
            Would be cool to know wich Orgs are behind the OWL teams, id rather cheer for a team i like/know than for a state of a country i dont even live in

Edit: just found out this:


London Spitfire - Cloud9

Dallas Fuel - OpTic

Atlanta Reign - Atlanta Esports Venture (the same that owns FaZe in CoD)

SFS - NRG esports

Seoul Dinasty - Gen.G

Los Angeles Valiant - Immortals/MiBR

Florida Mayhem - Misfits Gaming

Los Angeles Gladiator - Same group that holds LA guerrilla in CoD

Toronto Defiant - Same group that holds MAD Lions

Philadelhpia Fusion - 34% T1 (somehow, basically Comcast Spectacor holds 34% of T1 and owns PF)


The other teams just dont have any parent groups or owners that also own other teams, so they are basically 'new' organizations
                Some of them are easy to know because of color scheme of the team skins sometimes match up with the orgs team colors in other esports. Dallas Fuel is OpTic Gaming (formerly known as EnVy hence the darker blue that the team skins use), Outlaws USED to be OpTic Gaming (hence the green and black color scheme of their team skins) under their former parent company Infinite eSports (which no longer exists because they sold off all their assets, OG got sold to IGC then to NRG in 2020 then eventually being bought by Mike "Hastro" Rufail and merging his company with Hector"HECZ" Rodriguez's company OpTic Gaming. Eventually retiring the EnVy branding a few months ago in favor of OpTic Gaming's branding). Los Angeles Valiant is Immortals Gaming Club. San Francisco Shock is NRG.
                    Yeah! Did some research and updated my reply with some owners and parents of this teams that i think might be the closest we would get to OG teams from other games.
    I didn't realise London, Vancouver, Toronto, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Seoul were regions of the USA...
        I didnt know that Los Angeles and Philadelphia were in Asia either🤷

The point is that this OWL system is shitty compared to other eSports competitions, and its US fault for coming up with that ass idea of a league. Blizz based OWL on the north american sporting leagues
            "I dont even know why they switched from the "WORLDWIDE" esports system to a regionalized "USA" system"

That's what you said, I was just proving you wrong.

I guess spreading misinformation is OK as long as it's to make a point?
                It is a USA system tho, Blizz based the league in Northamerican leagues. Thats literally what i said, regionalized USA system instead of the worlwide competitions like Majors, Worlds, etc. OWL is the only competition from OW so its not like theres a league and a champiomship where OG teams face each other.

Also, im not spreading misinformation, thats literally what it is. East bracket holds Asian teams and 2 american teams that arent even close to Asia to just put them there.
                    Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to defend OWL, and maybe you just framed your original comment badly,
I mean OWL is still a worldwide esport, just its financial barrier to entry and limited success have made expansion rather slow.

I personally don't care if teams are named after cities or esport orgs, my one gripe is OWL killed the Apex Overwatch League in korea.
    IMO, it all boils down to OW's severe lack of depth and team comp variety compared to other hero based team games.

In something like LOL or DOTA, or even Siege, you have WAY more characters than OW, and each of them come with a sizable set of kit customization options for them, all adding depth ON TOP of their regular unique abilities.

OW2 has the default hero roster, and *thats it.* The ability to make builds for heroes adds way more depth and variety than you may think. I get why they did it; it makes heroes more accessible for casual play, but it also makes for VERY stale high level play.
        I think if they forced them to run different teams (like with team-specific bans or something), it would be much more interesting.

As of right now, same roster is just boring.
    >OWL is the most boring esports competition honestly, theres 0 personality in everyone using the same hero and teams called after states insted of the old Esports Teams.

Facts. I actually used to watch competitive overwatch a bunch in the early days, but stopped when OWL started. 

I really dislike the camera angles they used, some of the colour changes in game, the fact they were playing a different game than the live game, the constant POV switches that are usually too slow to even see the play, the huge wait times between rounds / games. Moving away from twitch didnt help, I don't even know it's live because if I want to watch a live stream I go to twitch and don't realise OWL is even live. 

But I recently watched the whole GOATs tourney that Harbleu played. It's literally so much more enjoyable to watch competitive from the POV of one player, to hear them discussing plays, seeing face cam the whole time etc. It feels much more like playing the game. 

It's weird how them making an official league killed it for me.
        Yes, when OWL moved to YouTube we lost the ability to choose which player feed to watch. That was huge for me (I got to watch how my favorite hero played and maybe learn something.)

I stopped watching when they lost that.
Overwatch is going to be way better and way more enjoyable to watch esport when it gets double the amount of heroes and game format are exactly like moba (can't switch heroes + ban/hero pick).

I've said it early on that duplicate hero was a bad idea and people fought to keep it until it became obvious things had to change. I think the same will happen with this.
    Yeah, it's really boring with mirrored matchups. They should at least introduce team-specific bans.
It would be better to watch if it stayed almost exclusively 1st person. The angles where the cameraman flys around take you out of the game instantly and it looks boring af. The 1st person views showcase the individual players skills more and allows us to relate to what they’re doing. 

Also they need to figure out a way to introduce hero bans or make it so you can’t be the same hero as the enemy team while they are locked into that hero. I’m imagining a hero lock in phase like league except here each role gets to choose 2 heroes to lock in instead of only 1. That way they can still swap to a hero of a certain type that’s maybe needed but can’t just be anyone in the fly. They also can’t just be the same hero as the enemy this way. Makes it way more interesting imo.

They need to fundamentally change how owl competitive works if they want it to stay popular. Imo both teams being able to play the same heroes as each other makes things very saturated and boring and it needs changing
    True.
    I think to "stay popular" is a bit reaching. I don't think it has ever been popular.

But I agree that they need to figure out how to make it fun to watch. Same heroes are just bad for viewership.
    The mechanic of the game is still like rock paper scissor, so I don't like locking out. I do however want to see at least 1 ban per team
        But owl is just scissors Vs scissors
Right now? Like since forever. Not really liking Reaper being picked instead of Tracer or Genji, but I prefer that over Goats, Zombie or Joats meta.
i cant wait to have it playing on 144p muted tab minimized
[deleted]
    Thats what Im doing Day 1 was especially bad because not only was every team the same every round was a 3-0 sweep.
    I honestly just had it running in the background for the drops.  


But I stopped now. Reconsidered and decided to deinstall the game instead. Fun ain't allowed in this game
    You can't believe people watch owl? I believe you can't believe it but it's true.
Fixed your headline, “viewers upset when pro players do their job”
    True. The OWL is boring as fuck to watch though ngl. I'd rather sit on my own balls then force myself to watch another monotonous game tbh
        I solved your issue, just don’t watch it
            but free crap
                Eyes don’t have to be on the screen. Personally I think this meta is great tho so you would be missing out.
            Good idea. I tuned into to see if it anything changed from OW 1, but nah. Blizz just doesn't understand that they need to actually balance their game before they add more characters it's hilarious
                You are wrong but ok. Maybe spend less time on Reddit and go play it for once.
                    Haha I don't care what you think since I experienced it myself. Enjoy fighting against the same 4 heroes for the next couple months lmfao
                        It’s pretty clear you lack a fundamental understanding of the game lol
    Fixed again, "viewers upset when the game is boring af to watch, meaning their esports are not worth it"
        Im sorry that you are one of the people that find every meta boring
Can someone explain how Winston is good? It I try and use him I jump on a squishy drop my shield when I start to get focused and am still usually dead before I can jump out
    Don't jump directly in.  Jump up to high ground, pressure from there, drop if you see an opportunity.  Don't hard-engage by jumping, only put yourself in danger if you have your jump available.
    Winston is good right now, but I'm pretty sure OWL is a patch ahead of us at the moment, meaning they're playing with nerfed Zarya and DVa.

The YouTuber/Coach Spilo just released a good video talking about [diving as Winston in Overwatch 2](https://youtu.be/MbGjnjftTV8).
    i think you just suck dude
        Lol good one I’m masters on tank I just can’t play Winston. I know it’s hard for you to understand when you get focused in silver and last longer than a half a second.
            dude chill it with the fragile ego lmaooo you’re probably edging diamond anyway
                GODAMMIT WALTUH
The game needed way more heroes when they started the league and they need even more now.
It’s so dull for real
As first time viewer it annoys me that the ‘best’ team comp for attack, defence and every map are the same. The fact that you can change hero mid game to adapt to the ‘stage’ you are in and no team will do that frequently just kind of feels wrong
    extremely well said. they can switch anytime and there is different maps yet no switches is insane. i saw one switch to widow at the start for 2 seconds and that was my highest excitement for it. I watched for the first time yesterday as well and was disappointed, thought it was gonna be fun to watch big tourny of game I like, like usual
i was like "hm , gonna watch for the first time, lets see", literally everything its the same comp on both sides, shit is boring af.
Monkey meta in full effect.
Reaper is meta?
    He's great into monkey and pairs extremely well with both Kiriko and Lucio.
    Apparently yes.
wait people like reaper now? I'm way out of the loop
    he only works because of kiriko and ofc vs winston
        He works regardless. Tank busting is more valuable than ever
I seen comments about picks and bans I know it goes against the core design of the game but that would be pretty interesting to watch. 

It would spice up games dramatically plus force different comps. Also you’d see a way bigger character pool since counter picking matters more.
You could never really have an OP team since you’ll be taking characters away from each other.
Houston vs Shock was pretty good, a few different comps here and there
Can someone explain why this is the meta, it’s so different from comp meta. Why are they not playing zarya or genji?
    They're ahead a patch from live

Zarya got nerfed 
Genji got nerfed
Sombra got nerfed
Dva got nerfed
Kitikk got nerfed
In OWL, at least, can we please have hero rotations?
And this is why the pro scene killed this game for casual players. All balancing revolves around the highest level instead of enjoyment.
Just spitballing here, but even if each team got 1 ban per class (tank, dps, support) and said bans applied to both team's rosters, making for a grand total of 6 bans I feel like that'd greatly help diversify the team comps we see.  And with only 6 bans, equally distributed among the 3 classes, that still leaves the teams with a lot of freedom for switching heroes mid-game to address whatever the current need is.
    I agree it should help a lot. I also think if bans are team-specific, meaning that they can't mirror after all these bans, it should be interesting to watch.
        My concern with that would be that mid-game hero swaps is a huge deal in OW.  Not being able to choose something that the enemy team can choose could be game loosing.  Even in games where you can't swap mid game, such as various MOBAs or siege, the bans typically apply to *both* teams to keep things fair. Not too mention that'd also mean that each team is only losing 3 heroes on the roster rather than 6.
            Yeah it might not work that well, considering the limited amount of heroes overall.

My biggest concern is that these teams are so used to mirrored meta, that they will might just fall back to it, so having different bans for teams should force them to do more interesting counterplays.

> the bans typically apply to both teams to keep things fair

Yes, but in MOBAs you can't select the same hero on both sides and you can't swap, so my idea is to allow slightly different roster while teams can ban best counterplays to their game plans.
That’s what happens when you barely touch characters that need nerfs
I kind of wish that each hero could only be used on one map each series... So if a team decided to go Winston, Lucio, Reaper, Sojourn, and Kiriko on Nepal then they couldn't select any of those heroes for the rest of the series... 

I think it would make teams plan a bit more strategically when facing different opponents.
OWL is irrelevant, 99.9% of players will never reach that level. im playing junkrat, junker queen, mercy, and having a blast.
    yeah SUPER irrelevant with 200k viewers before grand finals
        People just want the free shit lol barely anyone cares about these nobody orgs and ass artificial league
        yet the chat is barely moving
            Yep, at the tail end of the Day 3 stream (that is, right now), there are still 120k people "watching". I really doubt they were sticking around to hear commentators' insights on the games so far.
        I have the stream opened in a pinned tab, but I don't watch it (it's a little bit too much for me). Don't follow the matches, or know any teams/players, only check to see if the stream is running.
In other news, every Genji main in QP has switched to Reaper and sucks utter balls at it.
Shittiest esports scene ever
That's why you pop it on in the background and go on about your day. People are actually watching?
    Same. I have almost 800 League Tokens and can't even remember the last I watched a full match.
        I've had it on pretty much nonstop and every couple hours I alt tab over to see if anyone's changed heroes.
            Do you still get tokens if your stream is slightly behind?My stream keeps buffering.
                Did you put it at the lowest quality setting?  I'm not sure, it would make sense if you still got tokens as long as the broadcast itself is live.
I’ve learned that OW viewers really want to watch mystery heroes. No matter what the meta is people are mad.
    I think people want to watch different heroes/strategies. So bans would help, they probably can't afford to get no same heroes yet.
        That would just make 2 metas, which is what happened when OWL had rotating heroes. One week it was meta A the next it was meta B. People were complaining then too.
            Right, it all depends on the implementation. I think if bans are per team, not global, it should help with diverse teams.
The same as it's always been, but it's still great to watch.

It's like this in every top level of any e-sport, any pick that's not the absolute best min-max choice wont be picked because any tiny differences in picks can win or lose a game at that level. It's just different metas, happens all the time
This shit is annoying. Not the meta, people complaining about mirror matches. This happens literally every meta. This is not new.
    And they should change it to force people to use non-mirrored matches. If the sport is more fun to watch, it's a win-win for everyone.
    Maybe so many people are complaining because a bunch of fresh eyes are on it and it’s boring af to watch. Other e sports have fundamentally changed how their game works to make it more exciting for the viewers and players they can do it here too
Its always been this boring to watch. Overwatch was never made to be a comp game and even the league has shitty casting and awful camera work to make it even more boring
So what is so good with this comp? Watching OWL right now, but not sure what the appeal is.
    In my opinion I think Sojourn is the last character that is overturned at the highest of high levels so in order to pressure a hero with long range abilities you typically play Winston. Winston can also dive supports so you run the least diveable supports (Kiriko and Lucio). Then Reaper does a pretty good job at keeping Winston in check. Plus reaper synergizes well with Kiriko.
    Full rushdown with Kiriko ult, Reaper then pops off.
That's what pro play is tho. They will always pick the best characters. Blizz can balance the game all they want,but there will always be a best team
    They can forbid it with bans/no mirrored heroes.
        No mirrored heroes would be extremely unfair. And even if they add bans, the meta will just be same team + replacement for a ban
            That's why bans should be per team so they can't mirror best choices.

I think it would be more fun to watch. As for unfair, they can fine-tune the ban system until it feels more fair but still fun to watch.
Tell me you know nothing about OWL without saying so...🙄
Overwatch player discovers what a meta is
I think the biggest problem is that these teams find a really good team composition and assume that it’s the only one that will work. They think if they switch anything about the comp they will automatically lose. I really don’t feel like this is the case. I feel like pro players get too caught up on the “meta”
    Tell me you don't scrim without telling me you don't scrim.
        I refuse to believe that with all of the different heroes in the game that one single composition of the same 5 heroes is the only comp that can get the win. There was only one comp like that (GOATS) and that isn’t possible anymore. You mean to tell me that a Kiriko, Ana, Genji, Sojourn and Winston comp wouldn’t work? I find that hard to believe. Imagine a nano bladed genji charging at you with a Kiriko ult.
            Fine ill explain to you why your specific comp won't work since you obviously don't understand either macro or micro play.

Since tanks would be the same I won't be touching that

DPS- Sojourn is a good start, she's the best dps in the game currently, genji though isn't. Pros are playing  a patch ahead of live servers where genji got giga nerfed. Specifically they lowered his damage past a damage breakpoint (he can no longer rightclick + melee a squishy) and nerfed his ammo. This means genjis burst damage now sucks and his sustained damage now sucks. Since the other team is playing a reaper and Lucio and your team isn't, your monkey gets walked at and dies

Supports- Again a good start suggesting kiriko since she's the best support in the game right now. As for ana, since your traded speed for some extra healing, you now have no way of disengaging from a fight and your monkey gets walked at and died or your ana gets walked at and dies.

Ult Combo- Since, yet again, you are playing no Lucio and the other team is, they can just amp speed away from your nano blade, and if you want to use kiriki ult to try and catch up to them, you have now invested both support ults into a single fight, plus blade, and the other team could have just made it a dry fight.

Recap- The comp you suggested has worse neutral, worse engages, worse disengaged, worse ult fights, worse ult rotations, worse macro, worse micro, and worse active fights than what is being played in owl.

So once again, tell me you don't scrim without yelling me you don't scrim

As for what you said about goats being the only comp that was a must pick, apparently joats, zarya comp, zombie, and double shield never existed, good to know none of the last e years of ow just didn't happen.

Edit: Just because you don't understand why pros are playing what they're playing doesn't mean its just some random choice. These players and their coaches are competing for hundreds of thousands of dollars, they aren't going to be fucking around when trying to figure out what works.
        People downvoting me because im right 

&#x200B;

interesting
Ah yes love me some pro scene audiences that have no clue about the concept of a meta
Watched OWL Yesterday for the First time, so boring that all Play the same Operator.
People watch OWL for showdown of different heroes? I watch it knowing it will be same 10 heroes over and over, yet these guys are the best at those heroes and will give us great spectacle. This is what happens in Moba games, especially when we have like thirty-something heroes
it's absurd to me how people complain about metas so much. It really doesn't matter what the meta is, people will complain that it's "boring" to watch.. if you want your team to win, then they need to play the most optimized composition
Y'all actually watch it? I just run it on another chrome tab to collect my free things
And Koreans. Can’t forget about the Koreans repping Texas and Atlanta, etc etc.
The mirror match problem is easy to solve. Just introduce a draft mode for competitive. Each team takes turns to pick heroes, but each hero can only appear in one team. 

You want Reaper? We 'll take Junkrat for example. Your tank player likes Rein? Too bad, we picked it to remove it from your team. Now you can pick widow and our dps must make do with Ashe. 

Bans should be available at some point but I think that one ban from both sides wouldn't be so bad.

Play the attack with these heroes, then both teams redraft for def.
    That sounds absolutely horrible and not competitive in the slightest 😂
        So DotA2 is not competitive right? Because this is how drafting in DotA2 works
            Different games entirely
        It introduces strategy element where you need to figure out how to outplay enemy team not just on mechanical level.

OW will probably get there, but in like 3 years, when there will be enough heroes.
I think if you are as good as your rank says, you should be able to adapt.

Competitive Mystery Heroes will separate the wheat from the chaff.
We are really in need of hero bans
That comp sounds like it's asking to get pegged by a Bridget. Why isn't she picked into it? I don't watch this trash so no clue what's going on
Haven’t seen many Winstons actually
Wait, you guys have servers that work?
    Yes?

Reaper hard carrying my rank baby
As I look up from this post to the OWL playing on my computer to this exact comp on both teams.
you telling me that theres still a meta???
Are the streams that give the points up I need more Seoul skins
Why these champs are the meta? I'm new to ow
Wow
overwatch players when a meta is 3 days old
Ooh we pretending overwatch league doesnt use meta loadouts now
Still better than double shield, goats, and snipers on Havana…
Do people not watch owl at all. It’s literally always a mirror match , nothing has changed lol. Yes it’s boring af to watch the same comp over and over
mommy kiriko is pretty balenced
lmao ar vs fm right now same comp
To be fair it is not 100% staple depends on the map unlike in the past.
Idk about y’all but personally I’m ENJOYING finally seeing Reaper have a place in OWL. He’s basically never been a prominent pick so this is making for a refreshed meta.
Wait, did Reaper get buffed? Is his bullet spead not ass any more?
You guys don't know hie competitive games work so you? This isn't your comp games where peepee will pick what they want, these teams are PAID to PERFORM. If a certain meta is established as best then that's what they play, cause that wins, whatt they're paid to do.
Imagine if OW2 had a draft pick mode. I wonder what it would be like.
    Games would take forever imo. I think they should have quick team specific bans (1 per role) and bans can't be mirrored.

This way 2 characters at max will be the same.
Winston? I thought Zarya was the meta tank
    They're playing on a future patch iirc.
Lucio has been the center/a core component of all but one metas through the game's existence, and yet he never recieved half as many nerfs as Brigitte did :(
Someone should introduce Charles to Danteh. The man plays every hero at the highest level.
Cool. Not just me then.
they really need to stop making metas and make all characters more viable FASTER! not this patch in 2 weeks nonsense
In chess, they have this championship called the Fischer randoms, where the non-pawns are in randomized positions and mirrored for each player.  This is to stop opening dominance, or "meta" dominance.  

I was thinking OWL could do the same.  No swaps: map 1 -- each team gets to use || pick ping pong balls out of a box || Doom, bastion, echo, moira, bap.  New heroes next match.  Have fun.  

The problem is I think a lot of people ENJOY playing and mastering meta,  As a non-meta player who moves between GM and diamond based on whether my heroes are good, I am used to the same of not embracing the meta in the higher tier games.  You get bullied.
You can’t watch top level play and complain they use meta lol
teams had 5 days to practice þe patch, kiriko, sojourn, and winston are top tiers, and reaper and lucio compliment þem. of course every team is playing þe same comp
Bans are great, and they provide clear data for balancing. If the same heroes are always getting banned, it's a clear sign they need adjustment.
We need hero bans asap.
Replace Lucio for Moira.
Your first mistake was watching the overwatch league
Why don't they give teams bans like in moba games? Like, 1-2 bans per team and map and it should be sufficient to shake things up regularly.
    Don't have a 100% correct answer for this but in my opinion, I think we are slowly going to get into that state...I think the thing holding them back is the lack of heroes to pick from. There are 100+ ~~heroes~~ champions in those MOBAs but in overwatch we have 35. I think it will be more viable to have pick/ban system after we get like 50+ heroes.

Also, there have been tournaments with pick/ban systems in OW1 but people have picked and ban around the meta because they are good at the meta so it isn't a 100% deterrence from the meta BUT, I think it will definitely help.
        Is issue isn't the number of heroes, but the fact that switching heroes mid-match is part of the core gameplay.

In MOBAs, it doesn't matter really how many you ban, because there will always at least be enough for all 10 players.
            Agree with you on this but I'd add it to my point.
            > but the fact that switching heroes mid-match is part of the core gameplay.

That may have been their intention, but it really isn't—at least not in OWL.
                Well they haven’t done anything to incentivize it… they even removed open role queue for a while
                Exactly. Ideally you pick strong generalist heroes that don't require swapping so that your players can specialize and master 1 hero instead of 10. You also never risk losing any ult charge.
                    The idea of Overwatch was for there to not be mains and that you should swap to counter the enemy,

The problem was the 50 players trying to play Genji and get very offended when asked to swap when they're underperforming (because the enemy team has Winston/Zarya/Symmetra/Mei/Moira/Brig)
                        The game can be very weird in that dropping your main isn't always the best choice because your performance may actually go DOWN in an attempt to counterpick.

For example, I play a lot of Junkrat and regularly see people swap to Pharah to try and "counter" me but they often have very little playtime on her and get killed even more easily than before. Usually because they'll go too deep in order to try and kill me.

Hero swapping has always looked cool on paper but been incredibly hard to actually accomplish. The best counter isn't always a hero that you're good at.
                            But sometimes you can achieve it with bare minimum of the counter pick.

And it's still better to at least try rather than to be bitter about it. Then again, it depends on the hero. If a Reaper is destroying our backlines I will still try to either take Cass to take him out, or Reaper/Genji myself to fuck up his backlines. If the enemy is playing an oppressive Dva, I'll go Zarya because just bare minimum effort from Zarya can tear her down.

But if the enemy team has a really good Cassidy, yeah, not much I can do since he fucks up almost anyone in a 1v1. A good counter for him would be a sniper but my aim sucks, but I still try to play Widow against him.

Another thing is, the game kinda forces a 50% winrate (or better yet, 33% near-guaranteed wins, 33% near-guaranteed losses, 33% games that you can somewhat tip in your favor), so even if you try to counter them your team will still not coordinate with you or help you out.

Always try to counter the team, I mean if seems like you're bound to lose, there's nothing to lose so try to take out their strongest player with their counter.

One of my most memorable moments of OW1 (comp) was when a Widowmaker was destroying us, so I begged one of our tanks (the one that was actually reading the chat and the only one communicating, they were playing good otherwise) to go Winston instead of Orisa, they said "BUT I'M YOUR ONLY SHIELD" and it took some convincing like "we won't need a shield if you contest that widow", then they said "but I almost never play Winston!" and after some yapping they reluctantly swapped, and then proceeded to asshammer that Widow for the rest of the match and she never even swapped. Then I praised the Winston for carrying us and they were so happy about it.
                                Sometimes? Yes. Often? No.

It's impossible to play on equal footing with all heroes and not every hero has an accessible hard counter.
            Switching heroes mid match is not a part of the core gameplay at this level, for the simple reason that it don't happen.

I prefer no switching heroes and a diverse meta rater than no switching heroes and a boring mirror comp meta.
            Even if each team got 1 ban per class (tank, dps, support) and said bans applied to both team's rosters, making for a grand total of 6 bans I feel like that'd greatly help diversify the team comps we see.  And just 6 bans, equally distributed among the 3 classes still leaves the teams with a lot of freedom for switching heroes mid-game to address whatever the current need is.
                I agree. Imo mirror matchups in a game with skills just are not that interesting, I want to see how they counter enemy formation in not ideal conditions.

I also don't care that they wouldn't be able to master 1-2 heroes, I want a spectacle, not the most efficient matchup.
                    A game based around rapid swapping like ow would not work with locks like that though
                        Why not? They would still have 30 heroes available.
                            Because the individual pools for things like tank and healers are fairly small and not being able to counter or swap to some heroes whilst the enemy team can use them would be dodgy.

You can swap heroes mid game, so unless both teams have access to the same picks, it’d be unbalanced.
                                Yes, it would be unbalanced, but the idea behind bans is to unbalance it for the other team while still being able to counter whatever they will pick based on current meta. It is not about ideal balance, it is about outplaying your opponent.

3 bans should not be that disrupting (1 per role). Maybe next year, when they have more tanks/supports? They probably won't do it anyway, but I firmly believe it would make it more fun to watch (I don't think it's needed in regular comps).
                                I specified that the 6 total bans would apply to *both* teams' rosters.  There wouldn't be an instance where one team swaps to a hero that the other can't access.
                > And just 6 bans, equally distributed among the 3 classes

For them to be equally distributed in **impact**, it'd need to be 1 tank, 2 damage and 0 support bans, though.
                    Yeah sure, something along those lines would be fine too.  I'm just spitballing here so the total number of bans and how many bans each particular class get would be something interesting to explore.
                So how would that not lead to seeing mirror matches of the 7th through 11th best heroes?
                    Ideally if teams ban the typical top performers for each role, who individually tend to be capable of performing what several other heroes can do, that'd open up some variability.  For example if Sojourn is banned, maybe one team who really values her for her ability to delete squishies from a distance will replace her with Widow Maker while another team who valued her for her extreme mobility will replace her with a Genji.

I feel like one of the issues with the top picks right now is that it stems from some heroes being able to do too much.  So instead of having to choose to we want to pick the hero who can do X really well or the hero who does Y, they get funneled into picking the hero can can do X, Y, *and hell, even Z* really well and from there they're also forced to pick heroes who can both synergize with that said hero and can serve as a counter since the enemy team is going to pick them too.  Give teams the ability to ban and hopefully that'll result in them having to mix things up a bit.
            I sometimes wonder if allowing players to switch mid-match is part of what makes teams all use the same comp.

Most team compositions have strengths and weaknesses. But if the enemy team can switch heroes at any time, then obviously they are going to exploit your team's weaknesses - every time.  So then, the only option is to pick the most bland comp, with no significant weakness to exploit (and probably no particular strengths either, because there is some balance in the heroes).
        50+.. My children will love ow5
            Ow5 the ultimate 2v2 team base live service fps.
                OW4 being a battle royal was a hot mess.
        > I think it will be more viable to have pick/ban system after we get like 50+ heroes.

How many years away are we from 50 heroes?
            It'll be 2030 and each hero will need to be purchased for 20$. Some of the pros will be forced to find new comps to fit around certain team members not owning and having paid for that character.
                2030 and our accounts are gonna be so valuable because we have half the dps and all 8 healers unlocked from being a legacy player
                    and we'll be getting all hyped up for the Final Pre-release PVE Beta!
                Don't forget, it'll be Overwatch 3/4 by then too, and competitive, any new gamemodes, and maybe even parts of the maps will probably be sold as extras!
                    There is no more game modes. It's just a custom streaming client you can use to watch pros play, but you got to pay each hero or you won't be able to see what a player using that hero is doing.

        >Also, there have been tournaments with pick/ban systems in OW1 but people have picked and ban around the meta because they are good at the meta so it isn't a 100% deterrence from the meta BUT, I think it will definitely help.

~~People pick ban around the meta in MOBAs too.~~ People pick/ban around the meta in any esport.
        Paladins had banning in ranked even when they had 30 characters, now they have over 50, and increased it from 4 bans (2 for each team) to 6 bans, 3 per team. It works great, cause everyone is in accordance and bans the brain dead annoying characters that require no skill which makes the game much more fun and skilled overall. Bans would be good for ranked, idk about OWL since it’s just metas in there. Ranked actually uses most characters, but I am so down to not have to play brain dead characters like Rat.
    I think it would largely end up being the same. Everyone bans the same couple things each time and then you just pick the best of what's still available.
        Yeah, there isnt a deep enough pool of heroes to make bans interesting. 

Plus, if everyone just bans 2 supports then oof.
            Can only ban one support. Wow that was easy.
                You are still banning 25% of the support roster, though. 

Like, bans would be cool, if we had more heroes.
                    ??? 12.5%.
                        Each side gets one support ban
                            Why? Who says? Just allow 1 support ban max.
                                Because there are two teams. Also I say since this shit is made up anyway. You tried to correct the person above you and are now digging your heels in when I clarified his reasoning
                        Both sides ban one
                    I said this in another comment, but **actually** balanced bans would need to be 1 tank, 2-3 damage and 0 support, *per team*.

This would try to presence the relative impact each ban has, given the size and variety of each roster.
        That's what happens in R6S. Everyone bans Clash and the rest of the bans are just annoying coz now you cant play your main.
            Exactly, I get why people might think bans would help, but overall I think it would just be more annoying.
                It would be interesting if the system made you ban one hero out of tank, support, or dps - and that decision is random
                    This did actually happen for a few weeks way back in 2018 just after the addition of role lock
            Btw we wan't pick and bans for OWL, not your usual ranked games.
        Yeah. I would love hard meta over powered characters to be banned every game. Allows for variety and not just the same comp every game like OWL. We ain’t getting paid to use the same character for ever. Have some fun with comps.
        It'd give them the option to show something cool. In MOBA games, bans and picks are situational, and it is much more entertaining than mirror matches
    Cause then we’d just get “Teams keep banning the same hero’s over and over.” Posts.
        Not necessarily. They will ban here and there heroes where enemy is known to be really good at, and the other team can ban some counters to their strategy.

In ideal world, they should not allow same picks , but I understand that hero switching doesn't really work with it (not that people in OWL use it anyway).
    Same reason you can't ban guns in tac shooters. Both can play same.
    Teams are good at the current meta, they are not as good at anything else. They'd rather ban counters to the meta most of the time. This is partly a consequence of Blizzard not putting out remotely enough heroes since Overwatch launched. When you reach around 50 characters is when you hit critical mass of having to actually engage with the ban system.
        They cant balance the current heroes in a timely manner, I wouldnt trust them with more
            They *can* balance them in a timely manner, they just don't want to for whatever reason. It's not like it actually takes them months to go and change a 4 to a 3 in the code.
                Yeah, I've never understood why they let things go as long as they do. They typically only want to balance in between seasons and sometimes mid-season. It wouldn't be so bad if they were transparent about their reasons, but they never are.

If they were like, "We know Zarya feels oppressive right now but internal stats show that her damage output and win percentage are in line with similar tanks. Here is a spreadsheet of our numbers. We will continue to monitor for any change that match player anecdotes."
    I love me some bans honestly.
    Two heroes of each role (4 for dps) are locked each round, a single hero can't be chosen twice in a row, and those locked heroes are the same for both teams
    I have an idea a few months ago and is pretty simple: 

You can only use a hero 2 games out 5. You need to win 3 games and at least will be 3-5 games per match so you have have at least 2 to 3 set of heroes and be good at it! In a game you can change to whatever hero but the hero with 51% of usage on that game will be enough to have 1 use and you can only use it one more time in one more game, then is ban for the rest of the match..
    There should be hero bans for sure. Would really lift the variety and counter play of the game.

The issue could be that certain heroes are consistently banned. Maybe the roster needs to be slightly larger first
    I love OWL but I wouldn't expect logic. They decided on a format where a team can lose the match but still have to play another map anyway. People at blizzard had meetings about the format of OWL, it was discussed at length by a group of people, multiple times, and that is the conclusion they came to.
    I agree! But Teams will just ban the strongest of the meta. For example team 1 will just ban kiriko and team 2 will just ban sojourn. Then teams will just pick around the bans and will still result to repetitive compositions. That even happens in MOBAs even with upto 5 bans per team. Meta is meta for a reason and they are playing to win.  Ofcourse they will always pick the best comp to win. And unlike MOBAs, both OW teams can pick the exact same comp resulting to a mirror match.
    Bans are more relevant when there’s actually counterpicks. The new direction overwatch is going is to have less hard counters, which subsequently will mean any meta picks won’t really have answers to shut them down.. and I suspect compositions will be become even more homogenized than in OW1. Sad, really. They didn’t need to change the direction of the game or rework a bunch of shit just to call it a sequel- they just needed to keep adding maps, modes, and heroes to the original.
    I think they should allow independent bans (e.g. each team can ban a hero for the opposing team but can pick them themselves). I understand that OW doesn't have enough heroes for fully non-overlapping picks, but mirror matchups are as boring as they go.
the fuck is "JOATS"
    Goats with junker queen I presume
        Yea it played very closely to GOATS but the comp was actually (Junker Queen, Sojourn/Ashe, Genji, Lucio, and Brig).
    Jeans + GOATS
They should prevent mirror games somehow. Give different pools of heroes to each team. They should pick their heroes one by one and maybe ban some heroes too.
    They tried something last year called hero pools were the most played hero in a previous stage was banned. Some people in the community loved it, some hated it. But I described in a previous comment that I personally think we will get to a pick/ban system. Just right now, there aren't that many heroes.
    While that may be more entertaining it would be much less competitive that way.
It has not always been this bad. Sometimes, yes, but almost always there have been at least one or two slots that would shift from team to team. Complete and constant mirror comps like this weren’t a thing back when I was watching.
    Yea I'm an OG OW esports fan and the meta would develop slowly into mirror matchups in the past. You probably watched during those periods of meta development. 

For this playoffs they are actually playing on the November 15th Patch we are getting soon and according some people, they believe the teams haven't had enough time to digest the patch so they are running the best comp they can find at the moment without time to experiment really and break the meta comp. They had 5 days to prepare which isn't great lmao.
And that's why I stopped watching it. I figured it'd be fun to watch a bit of pro games.

Ended up watching 2 matches of pirate ship and was bored and uninterested. 

Basically, came down to which team was better with the cheese.
    Yea I mean tbh it all comes down to what meta you enjoy watching. For me, I hated JOATS sooo much. I thought it was braindead (that was a very rigid meta). 

I enjoy this new one more (which is also a somewhat rigid meta that doesn't have a name).

People will enjoy different things...I generally enjoy OW esports cause I like seeing people play the game at it's peak but i don't enjoy metas hanging around for 6+ months. from August to now, we have had 3 rigid metas (JOATS -> Zarya Rush -> Winston Rush). So I am generally happy. 

In April, the meta was rigid until the gladiators broke it at playoffs and in mid-season madness we had the most fluid meta ever...people say that was the greatest OW tournament which I agree with.

But yea I get why people might not enjoy it if it was toooo cheesy.
Right? This is every single season of OW. One team figures out which composition gets the most value for the least effort and then everyone copies them. There's no reason not to do things that way unless there are more frequent balance changes, which they rarely implement during a season anyway.
Except 5v5 is boring as fuck and makes a more static meta
    WRONG
    RIGHT
why do ppl get so mad about this ? when you watch real sports every1 is playing human with no skills, same skin with a dif number  and they have almost the same stats. smh
seems i have to edit this since ppl clearly dont get a joke or sarcasm...yikes
    People get mad/disappointed because this game has 35 characters in it. It's lame to see the same 5 every single match
        i guess thats personal opinion, i pretty much prefer a small roster than having league model where they pump a new character every 1-2 months that is broken as hell. balance is also a pain in the ass with so many characters
        Haha which is entirely fair some metas are better than others *depending on what you enjoy watching lol.

Edit*
    I'm confused. When playing sports each person has entirely different sets of skills. They are playing the same sports and are all human, but they have very different strengths and weaknesses in their game. Your comment makes me think you know nothing about physical competition.
        bro it was a joke...chill
    This is more like if every single play in football was a forward pass.
Heroes can only be used once per map.
I'd never play anything else tbh
    I usually only play mystery heroes already
It would probably be the least toxic comp mode as well, since you can just blame RNG anytime you lose.
    Or itd be a double down of toxicity and youd get the jackasses that get genuinely, day-ruining pissed off at mario party.
    You'd get flamed if you didn't suicide until you got a 'meta comp', and then if they fixed that, flamed if you didn't suicide before dying to keep it.
    Genjis would still say 'support diff'. They always do.
Role queue mystery heroes. You get a random hero from that category
    I would counter this with players would have to learn the art of throwing a death to swap characters. I played mystery heroes with a full team before and it's definitely a playable strat.
^^^THIS IS THE BEST IDEA RIGHT HERE
seconded. but with all tanks having -20% HP pls.
    I could get with tanks having a little less hp
Only if it's role locked
    No way, there's an art to it
    No way, there's an art to it
I would love for mystery heroes to be more like ARAM in MOBAs where you stay the character you rolled. Only being able to ult every third match or so is killing the fun for me.
Ah yes, mystery heroes, where the team that happens to roll the most tanks and healers wins. Truly the height of balanced competition. XD
I think people, and especially newcommers, just want to see different heroes, different comp,  and why not some mid game swap.

Why play a hero shooter with more than 35 character if it's to play only 5 of them...
    I was mostly being flippant, I agree that constant mirror comps is probably bad for the pro scene, even if it’s totally rational for pros to do it.
    Ez. Heroes can only be used once per map.
        Honestly id be more interested in pro 5v5 elimination than mirror matchups

The game has the unique feature of hero swapping but its rarely used. Mobas are more interesting bc each team is forced to have a different strategy (or one team has heroes  that are better, like one scaling comp scales better in comparison)
    cuz out of the 35 heroes and each role specifically there are some that played at such high skill that they are a bit better so this players that really want to win will pick the best possible team comp.
they prob also have to practice it in skirmish and stuff so its not like they will just swap to test something in the mid of the competition
        Yup, but some heroes could just be a bit better because of the difference between attack or defense, or for some specific map (or a portion of it) in which one hero shine more than others, etc.

I'm really skeptical about mirror comp, I'm sure it's the right thing to do for pros, but to make an e-sport attractive in the long run it seems terrible.

If it can't be address by balance changes, let's introduce a pick and ban system with no mirror allowed. It would at least spice things up a little bit.
            1. Hero pools and bans have been tried in different levels of play and typically don’t work too well. (The only time it’s worked is when 1 hero is extremely busted cough launch brig cough)

2. Pick and ban with no mirror, my team picks first we get Lucio and we just won, okay Lucio is banned we pick sojourn and we just won again.    
In other games you have a large enough roster for this, in Overwatch well only 1 hero has a constant team speed boost, only 1 hero has constant anti heals. It just doesn’t work yet
                If the team that get one specific hero first has just won then the balance of the game is simply busted, and will never be fixed no matter the number of heroes.

I'm clearly not convinced, don't forget that the pick and ban process can take many form. With many different restrictions and order. I think it could be balanced. 

If anyone has any idea to make the pro scene something else than mirror matchups I'll be glad to hear more.
                If picking one hero means winning the game expose how badly balance it is rather than the pick/ban phase being the problem
                    The game is very poorly balanced when it comes to OWL, posts have been popping up showing 3 hero’s have over 97% play rate and I know Lucio has 100% 

This doesn’t happen in ranked, in ranked any 1 trick can hit rank 1 

It’s just a matter of who do you balance the game around
                Let's hope that they reach the amount of heroes to allow that relatively soon.

Honestly, mirror matches are just boring, no interesting strategic plays at all.
        kinda sucks tho. wish owl had  a faker moment where he pulls Ryze the worst champion in the game and dominates
    Not to mention all this talk about "Overwatch is about hero swapping and picking what you need!" and then see the same 5 characters every game.

People use the hero swapping as an argument against bans, but why does it matter when nobody ever swaps anyway?
        Well it don't, this argument is simply not valid.
    Because that’s how metas work, play the consistently best comp.
        The problem is not that pros play the best comp, but that the best comp is a boring mirror matchups. It's a game design problem, that devs (and not players) need to adress.

There is a meta in LoL too, but there is also diversity, some possibility to surprise people with a pick, etc.. To make OWL an interesting esport to watch, rules of the game need to change.
    There will always be certain heroes at the top of the meta, and they will be played to death in the competitive scene. That's how it is in every competitive game, and that's how it will always be. Eventually a team discovers something new, or it gets patched, but until then everyone will continue to play whatever is deemed as the best.
        We know that pro players just play the best of the best at the top elo, it's not the problem.

The problem is that the best of the best is a 5 hero mirror matchup, no matter the game mode, the map or it's side, or player ability. It's just bad game design for an e-sport. 

It's absolutely boring to know that every match of the playoffs up to the finals will be the same compo of Winston, Sojourn, Reaper, Kiriko, Lucio. Every thing just look and feel the same, it's bad. (We're far from the LoL top meta here) 

Add to that that all team have generic names instead of the famous e-sport clubs we all know from other competitive scenes, and we don't even have time to know players and teams before just being bored of watching the same thing.

Add a pick and ban system, no mirror allowed, and it's done : the OWL is more interesting and diverse.
            I fully agree. I just watched DotA TI and now tuned for OWL and it is such a snooze fest.

I feel like the game is optimized for pros, but I want a spectacle, some big brain moves, out of the box counters, very diverse approaches, etc. But right now mirror comp makes the most sense, I can't blame them.
        “That’s how it is in every competitive game”. Wrong, want an example? The International for Dota just ended and out of 123 characters only 8 weren’t picked or banned. It’s not the same genre yes but you can easily put a ban phase for 3 heroes (one per class) and still have a decent enough hero pool for a match
    its one of the reasons why I really don't understand who likes OWL...
More then likely if you love a off meta hero or something that's average when it comes to power your not even going to see anything cool with it in OWL.
    >Why play a hero shooter with more than 35 character if it's to play only 5 of them...

Because a lot of the people getting on board lately don't *really* want a team-based shooter, they want a downright shooter.
        Well considering what I see in my games it's not true. The fact that some are more popular or more meta doesn't mean that people don't care of hero diversity. In fact it's rare for people to never change heroes for a whole match.

And we can't adress OWL and our casual rank match as if it were the same thing. So a bit off-topic.
Yeah I’m surprised how fast it changed. It’s a good sign.
Independent bans (like you can use the banned hero, but the enemy team can't), and force teams to have unique bans.

1 ban per tank/DPS/support and that's it, every match will be at least somewhat different.
Balance the game for rock paper scissors as it was designed to be
Because the “counter picking “ part already happened in scrims when teams were figuring out the meta. There’s always going to be a best comp to play so the teams will play that. It’s easier to mirror what a team is doing and try and perfect the gameplay to beat them rather than experiment since you only got so much team to practice and scrim. 

Us regular players are able to “counter pick” a bit more easily because we are just normal players and one might know how to counter a comp while the other team doesn’t know how to react in time + they are prob flaming each other because they are randoms and are losing.
    [it's never been nearly as bad as now](https://twitter.com/PRE_owl/status/1587510063903768594?s=20&t=sCLfMvor4Ae5fd7H0aYVxQ)

It might just be playing something safe since the meta hasn't had much time to develop, especially on their patch
The teams basically played on that patch in a bubble against each other while preparing for playoffs over and over again. What you see now is the final result of endless counter picking. The meta comp.
    So if the best counter to a hero is that same hero, then there is no counter, just skills gaps and broken heroes. Pretty lame if you ask me for a game that prides itself on the notion of counter picking. 

Why does sojurn not have a counter?
    which is a fine example of why the forced 2-2-2 (now 1-2-2) meta was a ridiculous idea 4 years after instating it in the game.  Game should still be 100% open Q

Would this still lead to a preferred meta? Sure, but after watching over 1 decade of starcraft 1 and 2, seeing the meta get rethought every few months was exhilarating and one style never sat around too long in the pro scene before blozz would tweak some stats.  Then again, blizzard balanced and cared about starcraft.  Overwatch 2 just seems like continually adding new and more powerful heroes than the last ones added.
        No thanks. Role Q was by far the best change to the Game.

I like not Watching goats and having more than 1 non-dps hero on my team regularly.
            sure, and the trade off means a lower skill ceiling and less overall meta options in competitive play.
What really is the counter pick for this composition?
    Unplug the enemy team's computers
        They can't stop you from grabbing a bat and smashing their equipment.
    The funny thing is that both teams are countering each other's Winston with Reaper. So there is *a* counter, it's just mirrored.
        And Winston is picked to counter Sojourn.
            And Sojourn is picked to counter enemy heads.
                I was really surprised that Widow wasn't more popular in OWL.

In optimized play where the goal is for everyone to play as perfectly as an aimbot would, wouldn't Widow be the natural pick for her infinite range oneshot?

I could understand in ow1 where it'd be physically impossible to get kills past shields, but now as well?
                    You can get those same widow kills with sojourn without being limited to long range and with better alternate abilities
                        So in ow1, it really was just shields that stopped owl players from playing widow?
                            No, widowmaker is a sitting duck, and in all practicality a throw pick in 90% of instances. 

Why play widow if genji or Winston will be picked? Or hanzo? 


Now with sojourn, widowmaker fills no niche. She is the inferior selection in every case, soloqueue or in coordinated play.
                    Depending on the map, attackers have picked widow to try for a grapple hook -> head shot out of spawn before Switching to sojourn in the play offs.
    I feel like dva would play, she tends to eat the monkey and can dive healers?
        Except the support comp is Lucio and kiriko, good luck catching up to them lol
For pro teams is easier to just find a solid composition and mirror because, talking about the current meta, you have a monkey to go in and kill the supports in the back, a reaper to melt the tank (in particular Winston), Sojurn because Sojurn, kiriko to follow Winston and her ult is amazing with reaper, Lucio because it's a solid pick at high levels and his ult is a rly good counter to engages. 

Now this comp is a solid comp but if they start switching they have to all die to fully switch the comp because if they only switch 1 or 2 to "counter" the comp stops "making sense" and a full wipe is always a big risk. 

Mirror comp it's just about pure skill since they all are using the same heros
Ults and tempo is too strong basically. Having to go all the way back to base, swap heroes, and restart building ult is expensive when things are so optimized.
    I don't think you walk back to base, you just counter pick when you inevitably die.
        If you die in pro leagues it's usually because you lost a teamfight. In that fight, you were also trying to kill them and you got ult charge, so you'd be giving that up while they're almost at their ults from the first teamfight
Maybe an upopular opinion but I don't think counter picking works in ranked either. Play the hero you know best. You will almost always get more value out of your main and maybe one off pick if you get hard countered. I just started doing that as a tank and have climbed from high bronze to low gold in like a week.
    Something weird happened to me last night. I was trying to learn Widowmaker, but their Tracer kept killing me, and my team wasn't doing well. Then I switched to my main DPS Junker Rat who I'm very good with, and we started demolishing them. It's almost like their counter pick lost them the game.
> Aside from the same heroes every round, I don’t understand how anyone can follow what’s going on, other than one team gets a pick or two and wins the fight.

This has always been the biggest issue with Overwatch as an e-Sport. It's just difficult to watch and understand if you don't watch the pro scene a lot. This meta isn't great as far as spectating, but it's also far from the worst OWL has had. Even if you do watch it a lot, there is always stuff that gets missed due to the pace of the game.

It's come up with observers and casters before, but the vast majority of them have said that OW is one of the most difficult games to cast and observe. There is just so much going on so quickly that some stuff is going to be missed.
    This is exactly the reason why CS:GO has so many regular viewers. Its e-Sport scene is very approachable, even for people who never play a video game.

Players shoot guns, throw grenades, buy more and repeat.
        Imo CS is way too slow for me to get into, same with Valorant

But at the same time OW is nigh incomprehensible from a visual perspective
    I mean you miss a lot in football but you understand where the ball is at least and I think thats the issue. The objective needs to be very clear and the way they get there too.
        Most of the time, the objective isn't even the 2nd most important thing happening.
    Why not at least have a minimap?  The functionality is already there, they just need to find a way to display it.
        Would that really help? The issue with spectating isn't in the pre-teamfight setup. The staging before a teamfight is pretty clear. The issue is during a teamfight when all the particle effects let loose and you have 10 players all stacked right on top of each other. A minimap isn't really going to help with team fight clarity.
            When Winston jumps, it's nice to know who he's jumping to and where the rest of their team is.  A minimap would show how the rest of the team is responding to what's immediately on screen.

They spend a lot of time on dps cam watching them chase one or two kills.  While that's happening, I have no idea how the rest of the teamfight is going except for the healthbars, which don't tell me who is shooting whom from where.
        Youtube compression on OWL streams are so shit you will barely be able to make out what's what with a minimap in the corner. 

Now if they go back to Twitch, and have a main stream + a minimap stream, that would be nice.
            Maybe I am misremembering but didn't they for a time have the option on twitch to select one player perspective to follow on a side stream?
                Yes, back in 2019.
>Aside from the same heroes every round, I don’t understand how anyone can follow what’s going on, other than one team gets a pick or two and wins the fight.

IMO, it has always been his main issue.

OW is quite fun to play and may be to watch if you're watching a streamer but for an e-sport, it's messy as fuck.
    When they were on twitch they had that FP POV where you could swap between players. That made it so much more bearable to watch for me since I'd just watch heroes I liked without trying to take in a full 6v6 fight all at once.

Until they bring that back idk if I really enjoy watching it. Shit happens so fast I spent most of the time watching the kill feed.
    Yeah, I think MOBA games are miserable to play , but are really fun to watch, meanwhile OW is super fun to play but pretty awful to watch.
OW is easily one of the worst spectator games and I'm astonished Blizzard thought it was a good idea to make this big push with it a few years back. Like I play this game and even I will have no clue what the hell is really going on.
    I unfortunately agree. It’s such a cluster fuck and it’s really hard to tell who’s on what team. Especially when both teams are the samw
    Same
    So what about those of us who can tell whats going on? I have no trouble keeping up so I dont get these assertions.
        Congrats?
            I was waiting for a response like this. I guess theres no response to people who make statements like the person i responded to.
                What reply did you want? Did you want someone to call you a liar? Or perhaps try to fight you on your statement? No one is saying it's impossible to keep up with whats going on, or that there is no one on the planet that can. Was just a comment on how it's extremely messy to follow for the vast majority of people, which it is. I dont think casters saying that it's hard to follow can be taken lightly, when most of them have done multiple different e-sports.
                    Lmao. People find football hard to follow too. Its about competence. messy to follow? Dont watch then. The casters also said goats was a great meta. They just say whatever.
The more you play in a competitive team setting the more you understand what’s going on in OWL. It’s definitely confusing to watch but you figure it out after a while.
Yeah. I've never seen OWL before but decided to take a look yesterday.

Not even meth could make my mind fast enough to keep up. It's certainly impressive, but also incomprehensible.

Are the players tested for Adderall or other drugs?
    Its easier to keep track when you're actually playing and fully focused rather than just watching
        Also, the shifting perspectives makes it harder to tell what's happening. Of course, they can't just leave it on one player's POV for the whole match, but if they did, it'd be easier to follow, albeit less interesting.
        Actually the complete opposite of sc2.

This was the game blizzard went full eSports on?
    And it's toned down with just 5v5. Although 6v6 was a shield fest until it was ultimate popping time
    I'm fairly certain if they have a prescription and don't abuse it then they are fine. It's an open secret in many esports, especially shooters, so maybe it's a don't ask don't tell type of deal too. It wasn't until a player leaked that most CSGO pros were on Adderall and gained media attraction that something was done.
100% agree. OW is a horrible e-sport. Blizz should have kept OW casual and focused their e-sports money on Hots, Sc2 and maybe wow arena.
I’ve never seen it so perfectly summarized
A mini map will help to follow a bit easier especially for flank but no idea why they don’t do it
Yeah, I stopped watching when dive became meta. Watching 12 players smash into each other for 15 seconds at a time wasn't all that great to watch.
Is there a reason why big organizations like T1, faze, 100T, etc. are not in the leagues? A new player here and i don't recognize any of the teams.
    because overwatch league is a blizzard run league. Not an open invite to anyone wanting to make a team. So the owner of a team might be one of those orgs but the name and stuff was set by Blizzard
    OWL decided to implement a city based League more in line with traditional sports, most of them are run by the big esports brands.
        Call of Duty ended up taking the same approach when the league became franchised going into Modern Warfare 2019. So teams for CoD such as EnVy (Dallas Fuel for OWL) named themselves Dallas Empire which is (now OpTic Texas with the merger of EnVy & OpTic last year) OpTic under Immortals Gaming Club was named LA OpTic (if I remember) FaZe is Alanta FaZe. NRG was Chicago Huntsmen and so forth.
        That has been conned into buying their spot and regret every second of it.
            Which team did you buy?
                [Just leaving this here.](https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-and-cod-franchises-reportedly-owe-activision-blizzard-up-to-dollar420-million/)

They were promised that OWL would rival the best esport on the planet and turns out it's a monumental fiasco.

To be fair they did trust the company that thought they could rival LoL in less than a year with Heroes of the Storm.
    As far as i know, a while back some games regionalized/signed a contract with US to represent different states. However, CoD league still uses their previous OG team branding like "Atlanta FaZe".

Dont know what happened with OW in particular but these teams i think were previous big organizations that were replaced with region organizations, but right now after 5 years theres no representation from this OG organizations on the league
    FaZe I think technically might be in the league. I assume the large company that owns Atlanta Reign also owns FaZe since FaZe has the Atlanta spot for Call of Duty.
        Would be cool to know wich Orgs are behind the OWL teams, id rather cheer for a team i like/know than for a state of a country i dont even live in

Edit: just found out this:


London Spitfire - Cloud9

Dallas Fuel - OpTic

Atlanta Reign - Atlanta Esports Venture (the same that owns FaZe in CoD)

SFS - NRG esports

Seoul Dinasty - Gen.G

Los Angeles Valiant - Immortals/MiBR

Florida Mayhem - Misfits Gaming

Los Angeles Gladiator - Same group that holds LA guerrilla in CoD

Toronto Defiant - Same group that holds MAD Lions

Philadelhpia Fusion - 34% T1 (somehow, basically Comcast Spectacor holds 34% of T1 and owns PF)


The other teams just dont have any parent groups or owners that also own other teams, so they are basically 'new' organizations
            Some of them are easy to know because of color scheme of the team skins sometimes match up with the orgs team colors in other esports. Dallas Fuel is OpTic Gaming (formerly known as EnVy hence the darker blue that the team skins use), Outlaws USED to be OpTic Gaming (hence the green and black color scheme of their team skins) under their former parent company Infinite eSports (which no longer exists because they sold off all their assets, OG got sold to IGC then to NRG in 2020 then eventually being bought by Mike "Hastro" Rufail and merging his company with Hector"HECZ" Rodriguez's company OpTic Gaming. Eventually retiring the EnVy branding a few months ago in favor of OpTic Gaming's branding). Los Angeles Valiant is Immortals Gaming Club. San Francisco Shock is NRG.
                Yeah! Did some research and updated my reply with some owners and parents of this teams that i think might be the closest we would get to OG teams from other games.
I didn't realise London, Vancouver, Toronto, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Seoul were regions of the USA...
    I didnt know that Los Angeles and Philadelphia were in Asia either🤷

The point is that this OWL system is shitty compared to other eSports competitions, and its US fault for coming up with that ass idea of a league. Blizz based OWL on the north american sporting leagues
        "I dont even know why they switched from the "WORLDWIDE" esports system to a regionalized "USA" system"

That's what you said, I was just proving you wrong.

I guess spreading misinformation is OK as long as it's to make a point?
            It is a USA system tho, Blizz based the league in Northamerican leagues. Thats literally what i said, regionalized USA system instead of the worlwide competitions like Majors, Worlds, etc. OWL is the only competition from OW so its not like theres a league and a champiomship where OG teams face each other.

Also, im not spreading misinformation, thats literally what it is. East bracket holds Asian teams and 2 american teams that arent even close to Asia to just put them there.
                Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to defend OWL, and maybe you just framed your original comment badly,
I mean OWL is still a worldwide esport, just its financial barrier to entry and limited success have made expansion rather slow.

I personally don't care if teams are named after cities or esport orgs, my one gripe is OWL killed the Apex Overwatch League in korea.
IMO, it all boils down to OW's severe lack of depth and team comp variety compared to other hero based team games.

In something like LOL or DOTA, or even Siege, you have WAY more characters than OW, and each of them come with a sizable set of kit customization options for them, all adding depth ON TOP of their regular unique abilities.

OW2 has the default hero roster, and *thats it.* The ability to make builds for heroes adds way more depth and variety than you may think. I get why they did it; it makes heroes more accessible for casual play, but it also makes for VERY stale high level play.
    I think if they forced them to run different teams (like with team-specific bans or something), it would be much more interesting.

As of right now, same roster is just boring.
>OWL is the most boring esports competition honestly, theres 0 personality in everyone using the same hero and teams called after states insted of the old Esports Teams.

Facts. I actually used to watch competitive overwatch a bunch in the early days, but stopped when OWL started. 

I really dislike the camera angles they used, some of the colour changes in game, the fact they were playing a different game than the live game, the constant POV switches that are usually too slow to even see the play, the huge wait times between rounds / games. Moving away from twitch didnt help, I don't even know it's live because if I want to watch a live stream I go to twitch and don't realise OWL is even live. 

But I recently watched the whole GOATs tourney that Harbleu played. It's literally so much more enjoyable to watch competitive from the POV of one player, to hear them discussing plays, seeing face cam the whole time etc. It feels much more like playing the game. 

It's weird how them making an official league killed it for me.
    Yes, when OWL moved to YouTube we lost the ability to choose which player feed to watch. That was huge for me (I got to watch how my favorite hero played and maybe learn something.)

I stopped watching when they lost that.
Yeah, it's really boring with mirrored matchups. They should at least introduce team-specific bans.
True.
I think to "stay popular" is a bit reaching. I don't think it has ever been popular.

But I agree that they need to figure out how to make it fun to watch. Same heroes are just bad for viewership.
The mechanic of the game is still like rock paper scissor, so I don't like locking out. I do however want to see at least 1 ban per team
    But owl is just scissors Vs scissors
Thats what Im doing Day 1 was especially bad because not only was every team the same every round was a 3-0 sweep.
I honestly just had it running in the background for the drops.  


But I stopped now. Reconsidered and decided to deinstall the game instead. Fun ain't allowed in this game
You can't believe people watch owl? I believe you can't believe it but it's true.
True. The OWL is boring as fuck to watch though ngl. I'd rather sit on my own balls then force myself to watch another monotonous game tbh
    I solved your issue, just don’t watch it
        but free crap
            Eyes don’t have to be on the screen. Personally I think this meta is great tho so you would be missing out.
        Good idea. I tuned into to see if it anything changed from OW 1, but nah. Blizz just doesn't understand that they need to actually balance their game before they add more characters it's hilarious
            You are wrong but ok. Maybe spend less time on Reddit and go play it for once.
                Haha I don't care what you think since I experienced it myself. Enjoy fighting against the same 4 heroes for the next couple months lmfao
                    It’s pretty clear you lack a fundamental understanding of the game lol
Fixed again, "viewers upset when the game is boring af to watch, meaning their esports are not worth it"
    Im sorry that you are one of the people that find every meta boring
Don't jump directly in.  Jump up to high ground, pressure from there, drop if you see an opportunity.  Don't hard-engage by jumping, only put yourself in danger if you have your jump available.
Winston is good right now, but I'm pretty sure OWL is a patch ahead of us at the moment, meaning they're playing with nerfed Zarya and DVa.

The YouTuber/Coach Spilo just released a good video talking about [diving as Winston in Overwatch 2](https://youtu.be/MbGjnjftTV8).
i think you just suck dude
    Lol good one I’m masters on tank I just can’t play Winston. I know it’s hard for you to understand when you get focused in silver and last longer than a half a second.
        dude chill it with the fragile ego lmaooo you’re probably edging diamond anyway
            GODAMMIT WALTUH
extremely well said. they can switch anytime and there is different maps yet no switches is insane. i saw one switch to widow at the start for 2 seconds and that was my highest excitement for it. I watched for the first time yesterday as well and was disappointed, thought it was gonna be fun to watch big tourny of game I like, like usual
He's great into monkey and pairs extremely well with both Kiriko and Lucio.
Apparently yes.
he only works because of kiriko and ofc vs winston
    He works regardless. Tank busting is more valuable than ever
They're ahead a patch from live

Zarya got nerfed 
Genji got nerfed
Sombra got nerfed
Dva got nerfed
Kitikk got nerfed
I agree it should help a lot. I also think if bans are team-specific, meaning that they can't mirror after all these bans, it should be interesting to watch.
    My concern with that would be that mid-game hero swaps is a huge deal in OW.  Not being able to choose something that the enemy team can choose could be game loosing.  Even in games where you can't swap mid game, such as various MOBAs or siege, the bans typically apply to *both* teams to keep things fair. Not too mention that'd also mean that each team is only losing 3 heroes on the roster rather than 6.
        Yeah it might not work that well, considering the limited amount of heroes overall.

My biggest concern is that these teams are so used to mirrored meta, that they will might just fall back to it, so having different bans for teams should force them to do more interesting counterplays.

> the bans typically apply to both teams to keep things fair

Yes, but in MOBAs you can't select the same hero on both sides and you can't swap, so my idea is to allow slightly different roster while teams can ban best counterplays to their game plans.
yeah SUPER irrelevant with 200k viewers before grand finals
    People just want the free shit lol barely anyone cares about these nobody orgs and ass artificial league
    yet the chat is barely moving
        Yep, at the tail end of the Day 3 stream (that is, right now), there are still 120k people "watching". I really doubt they were sticking around to hear commentators' insights on the games so far.
    I have the stream opened in a pinned tab, but I don't watch it (it's a little bit too much for me). Don't follow the matches, or know any teams/players, only check to see if the stream is running.
Same. I have almost 800 League Tokens and can't even remember the last I watched a full match.
    I've had it on pretty much nonstop and every couple hours I alt tab over to see if anyone's changed heroes.
        Do you still get tokens if your stream is slightly behind?My stream keeps buffering.
            Did you put it at the lowest quality setting?  I'm not sure, it would make sense if you still got tokens as long as the broadcast itself is live.
I think people want to watch different heroes/strategies. So bans would help, they probably can't afford to get no same heroes yet.
    That would just make 2 metas, which is what happened when OWL had rotating heroes. One week it was meta A the next it was meta B. People were complaining then too.
        Right, it all depends on the implementation. I think if bans are per team, not global, it should help with diverse teams.
And they should change it to force people to use non-mirrored matches. If the sport is more fun to watch, it's a win-win for everyone.
Maybe so many people are complaining because a bunch of fresh eyes are on it and it’s boring af to watch. Other e sports have fundamentally changed how their game works to make it more exciting for the viewers and players they can do it here too
In my opinion I think Sojourn is the last character that is overturned at the highest of high levels so in order to pressure a hero with long range abilities you typically play Winston. Winston can also dive supports so you run the least diveable supports (Kiriko and Lucio). Then Reaper does a pretty good job at keeping Winston in check. Plus reaper synergizes well with Kiriko.
Full rushdown with Kiriko ult, Reaper then pops off.
They can forbid it with bans/no mirrored heroes.
    No mirrored heroes would be extremely unfair. And even if they add bans, the meta will just be same team + replacement for a ban
        That's why bans should be per team so they can't mirror best choices.

I think it would be more fun to watch. As for unfair, they can fine-tune the ban system until it feels more fair but still fun to watch.
Tell me you don't scrim without telling me you don't scrim.
    I refuse to believe that with all of the different heroes in the game that one single composition of the same 5 heroes is the only comp that can get the win. There was only one comp like that (GOATS) and that isn’t possible anymore. You mean to tell me that a Kiriko, Ana, Genji, Sojourn and Winston comp wouldn’t work? I find that hard to believe. Imagine a nano bladed genji charging at you with a Kiriko ult.
        Fine ill explain to you why your specific comp won't work since you obviously don't understand either macro or micro play.

Since tanks would be the same I won't be touching that

DPS- Sojourn is a good start, she's the best dps in the game currently, genji though isn't. Pros are playing  a patch ahead of live servers where genji got giga nerfed. Specifically they lowered his damage past a damage breakpoint (he can no longer rightclick + melee a squishy) and nerfed his ammo. This means genjis burst damage now sucks and his sustained damage now sucks. Since the other team is playing a reaper and Lucio and your team isn't, your monkey gets walked at and dies

Supports- Again a good start suggesting kiriko since she's the best support in the game right now. As for ana, since your traded speed for some extra healing, you now have no way of disengaging from a fight and your monkey gets walked at and died or your ana gets walked at and dies.

Ult Combo- Since, yet again, you are playing no Lucio and the other team is, they can just amp speed away from your nano blade, and if you want to use kiriki ult to try and catch up to them, you have now invested both support ults into a single fight, plus blade, and the other team could have just made it a dry fight.

Recap- The comp you suggested has worse neutral, worse engages, worse disengaged, worse ult fights, worse ult rotations, worse macro, worse micro, and worse active fights than what is being played in owl.

So once again, tell me you don't scrim without yelling me you don't scrim

As for what you said about goats being the only comp that was a must pick, apparently joats, zarya comp, zombie, and double shield never existed, good to know none of the last e years of ow just didn't happen.

Edit: Just because you don't understand why pros are playing what they're playing doesn't mean its just some random choice. These players and their coaches are competing for hundreds of thousands of dollars, they aren't going to be fucking around when trying to figure out what works.
    People downvoting me because im right 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

interesting
That sounds absolutely horrible and not competitive in the slightest 😂
    So DotA2 is not competitive right? Because this is how drafting in DotA2 works
        Different games entirely
    It introduces strategy element where you need to figure out how to outplay enemy team not just on mechanical level.

OW will probably get there, but in like 3 years, when there will be enough heroes.
Yes?
Games would take forever imo. I think they should have quick team specific bans (1 per role) and bans can't be mirrored.

This way 2 characters at max will be the same.
They're playing on a future patch iirc.
Don't have a 100% correct answer for this but in my opinion, I think we are slowly going to get into that state...I think the thing holding them back is the lack of heroes to pick from. There are 100+ ~~heroes~~ champions in those MOBAs but in overwatch we have 35. I think it will be more viable to have pick/ban system after we get like 50+ heroes.

Also, there have been tournaments with pick/ban systems in OW1 but people have picked and ban around the meta because they are good at the meta so it isn't a 100% deterrence from the meta BUT, I think it will definitely help.
    Is issue isn't the number of heroes, but the fact that switching heroes mid-match is part of the core gameplay.

In MOBAs, it doesn't matter really how many you ban, because there will always at least be enough for all 10 players.
        Agree with you on this but I'd add it to my point.
        > but the fact that switching heroes mid-match is part of the core gameplay.

That may have been their intention, but it really isn't—at least not in OWL.
            Well they haven’t done anything to incentivize it… they even removed open role queue for a while
            Exactly. Ideally you pick strong generalist heroes that don't require swapping so that your players can specialize and master 1 hero instead of 10. You also never risk losing any ult charge.
                The idea of Overwatch was for there to not be mains and that you should swap to counter the enemy,

The problem was the 50 players trying to play Genji and get very offended when asked to swap when they're underperforming (because the enemy team has Winston/Zarya/Symmetra/Mei/Moira/Brig)
                    The game can be very weird in that dropping your main isn't always the best choice because your performance may actually go DOWN in an attempt to counterpick.

For example, I play a lot of Junkrat and regularly see people swap to Pharah to try and "counter" me but they often have very little playtime on her and get killed even more easily than before. Usually because they'll go too deep in order to try and kill me.

Hero swapping has always looked cool on paper but been incredibly hard to actually accomplish. The best counter isn't always a hero that you're good at.
                        But sometimes you can achieve it with bare minimum of the counter pick.

And it's still better to at least try rather than to be bitter about it. Then again, it depends on the hero. If a Reaper is destroying our backlines I will still try to either take Cass to take him out, or Reaper/Genji myself to fuck up his backlines. If the enemy is playing an oppressive Dva, I'll go Zarya because just bare minimum effort from Zarya can tear her down.

But if the enemy team has a really good Cassidy, yeah, not much I can do since he fucks up almost anyone in a 1v1. A good counter for him would be a sniper but my aim sucks, but I still try to play Widow against him.

Another thing is, the game kinda forces a 50% winrate (or better yet, 33% near-guaranteed wins, 33% near-guaranteed losses, 33% games that you can somewhat tip in your favor), so even if you try to counter them your team will still not coordinate with you or help you out.

Always try to counter the team, I mean if seems like you're bound to lose, there's nothing to lose so try to take out their strongest player with their counter.

One of my most memorable moments of OW1 (comp) was when a Widowmaker was destroying us, so I begged one of our tanks (the one that was actually reading the chat and the only one communicating, they were playing good otherwise) to go Winston instead of Orisa, they said "BUT I'M YOUR ONLY SHIELD" and it took some convincing like "we won't need a shield if you contest that widow", then they said "but I almost never play Winston!" and after some yapping they reluctantly swapped, and then proceeded to asshammer that Widow for the rest of the match and she never even swapped. Then I praised the Winston for carrying us and they were so happy about it.
                            Sometimes? Yes. Often? No.

It's impossible to play on equal footing with all heroes and not every hero has an accessible hard counter.
        Switching heroes mid match is not a part of the core gameplay at this level, for the simple reason that it don't happen.

I prefer no switching heroes and a diverse meta rater than no switching heroes and a boring mirror comp meta.
        Even if each team got 1 ban per class (tank, dps, support) and said bans applied to both team's rosters, making for a grand total of 6 bans I feel like that'd greatly help diversify the team comps we see.  And just 6 bans, equally distributed among the 3 classes still leaves the teams with a lot of freedom for switching heroes mid-game to address whatever the current need is.
            I agree. Imo mirror matchups in a game with skills just are not that interesting, I want to see how they counter enemy formation in not ideal conditions.

I also don't care that they wouldn't be able to master 1-2 heroes, I want a spectacle, not the most efficient matchup.
                A game based around rapid swapping like ow would not work with locks like that though
                    Why not? They would still have 30 heroes available.
                        Because the individual pools for things like tank and healers are fairly small and not being able to counter or swap to some heroes whilst the enemy team can use them would be dodgy.

You can swap heroes mid game, so unless both teams have access to the same picks, it’d be unbalanced.
                            Yes, it would be unbalanced, but the idea behind bans is to unbalance it for the other team while still being able to counter whatever they will pick based on current meta. It is not about ideal balance, it is about outplaying your opponent.

3 bans should not be that disrupting (1 per role). Maybe next year, when they have more tanks/supports? They probably won't do it anyway, but I firmly believe it would make it more fun to watch (I don't think it's needed in regular comps).
                            I specified that the 6 total bans would apply to *both* teams' rosters.  There wouldn't be an instance where one team swaps to a hero that the other can't access.
            > And just 6 bans, equally distributed among the 3 classes

For them to be equally distributed in **impact**, it'd need to be 1 tank, 2 damage and 0 support bans, though.
                Yeah sure, something along those lines would be fine too.  I'm just spitballing here so the total number of bans and how many bans each particular class get would be something interesting to explore.
            So how would that not lead to seeing mirror matches of the 7th through 11th best heroes?
                Ideally if teams ban the typical top performers for each role, who individually tend to be capable of performing what several other heroes can do, that'd open up some variability.  For example if Sojourn is banned, maybe one team who really values her for her ability to delete squishies from a distance will replace her with Widow Maker while another team who valued her for her extreme mobility will replace her with a Genji.

I feel like one of the issues with the top picks right now is that it stems from some heroes being able to do too much.  So instead of having to choose to we want to pick the hero who can do X really well or the hero who does Y, they get funneled into picking the hero can can do X, Y, *and hell, even Z* really well and from there they're also forced to pick heroes who can both synergize with that said hero and can serve as a counter since the enemy team is going to pick them too.  Give teams the ability to ban and hopefully that'll result in them having to mix things up a bit.
        I sometimes wonder if allowing players to switch mid-match is part of what makes teams all use the same comp.

Most team compositions have strengths and weaknesses. But if the enemy team can switch heroes at any time, then obviously they are going to exploit your team's weaknesses - every time.  So then, the only option is to pick the most bland comp, with no significant weakness to exploit (and probably no particular strengths either, because there is some balance in the heroes).
    50+.. My children will love ow5
        Ow5 the ultimate 2v2 team base live service fps.
            OW4 being a battle royal was a hot mess.
    > I think it will be more viable to have pick/ban system after we get like 50+ heroes.

How many years away are we from 50 heroes?
        It'll be 2030 and each hero will need to be purchased for 20$. Some of the pros will be forced to find new comps to fit around certain team members not owning and having paid for that character.
            2030 and our accounts are gonna be so valuable because we have half the dps and all 8 healers unlocked from being a legacy player
                and we'll be getting all hyped up for the Final Pre-release PVE Beta!
            Don't forget, it'll be Overwatch 3/4 by then too, and competitive, any new gamemodes, and maybe even parts of the maps will probably be sold as extras!
                There is no more game modes. It's just a custom streaming client you can use to watch pros play, but you got to pay each hero or you won't be able to see what a player using that hero is doing.
        in a few years.... behind $60 dlc
    >Also, there have been tournaments with pick/ban systems in OW1 but people have picked and ban around the meta because they are good at the meta so it isn't a 100% deterrence from the meta BUT, I think it will definitely help.

~~People pick ban around the meta in MOBAs too.~~ People pick/ban around the meta in any esport.
    Paladins had banning in ranked even when they had 30 characters, now they have over 50, and increased it from 4 bans (2 for each team) to 6 bans, 3 per team. It works great, cause everyone is in accordance and bans the brain dead annoying characters that require no skill which makes the game much more fun and skilled overall. Bans would be good for ranked, idk about OWL since it’s just metas in there. Ranked actually uses most characters, but I am so down to not have to play brain dead characters like Rat.
I think it would largely end up being the same. Everyone bans the same couple things each time and then you just pick the best of what's still available.
    Yeah, there isnt a deep enough pool of heroes to make bans interesting. 

Plus, if everyone just bans 2 supports then oof.
        Can only ban one support. Wow that was easy.
            You are still banning 25% of the support roster, though. 

Like, bans would be cool, if we had more heroes.
                ??? 12.5%.
                    Each side gets one support ban
                        Why? Who says? Just allow 1 support ban max.
                            Because there are two teams. Also I say since this shit is made up anyway. You tried to correct the person above you and are now digging your heels in when I clarified his reasoning
                    Both sides ban one
                I said this in another comment, but **actually** balanced bans would need to be 1 tank, 2-3 damage and 0 support, *per team*.

This would try to presence the relative impact each ban has, given the size and variety of each roster.
    That's what happens in R6S. Everyone bans Clash and the rest of the bans are just annoying coz now you cant play your main.
        Exactly, I get why people might think bans would help, but overall I think it would just be more annoying.
            It would be interesting if the system made you ban one hero out of tank, support, or dps - and that decision is random
                This did actually happen for a few weeks way back in 2018 just after the addition of role lock
        Btw we wan't pick and bans for OWL, not your usual ranked games.
    Yeah. I would love hard meta over powered characters to be banned every game. Allows for variety and not just the same comp every game like OWL. We ain’t getting paid to use the same character for ever. Have some fun with comps.
    It'd give them the option to show something cool. In MOBA games, bans and picks are situational, and it is much more entertaining than mirror matches
Cause then we’d just get “Teams keep banning the same hero’s over and over.” Posts.
    Not necessarily. They will ban here and there heroes where enemy is known to be really good at, and the other team can ban some counters to their strategy.

In ideal world, they should not allow same picks , but I understand that hero switching doesn't really work with it (not that people in OWL use it anyway).
Same reason you can't ban guns in tac shooters. Both can play same.
Teams are good at the current meta, they are not as good at anything else. They'd rather ban counters to the meta most of the time. This is partly a consequence of Blizzard not putting out remotely enough heroes since Overwatch launched. When you reach around 50 characters is when you hit critical mass of having to actually engage with the ban system.
    They cant balance the current heroes in a timely manner, I wouldnt trust them with more
        They *can* balance them in a timely manner, they just don't want to for whatever reason. It's not like it actually takes them months to go and change a 4 to a 3 in the code.
            Yeah, I've never understood why they let things go as long as they do. They typically only want to balance in between seasons and sometimes mid-season. It wouldn't be so bad if they were transparent about their reasons, but they never are.

If they were like, "We know Zarya feels oppressive right now but internal stats show that her damage output and win percentage are in line with similar tanks. Here is a spreadsheet of our numbers. We will continue to monitor for any change that match player anecdotes."
I love me some bans honestly.
Two heroes of each role (4 for dps) are locked each round, a single hero can't be chosen twice in a row, and those locked heroes are the same for both teams
I have an idea a few months ago and is pretty simple: 

You can only use a hero 2 games out 5. You need to win 3 games and at least will be 3-5 games per match so you have have at least 2 to 3 set of heroes and be good at it! In a game you can change to whatever hero but the hero with 51% of usage on that game will be enough to have 1 use and you can only use it one more time in one more game, then is ban for the rest of the match..
There should be hero bans for sure. Would really lift the variety and counter play of the game.

The issue could be that certain heroes are consistently banned. Maybe the roster needs to be slightly larger first
I love OWL but I wouldn't expect logic. They decided on a format where a team can lose the match but still have to play another map anyway. People at blizzard had meetings about the format of OWL, it was discussed at length by a group of people, multiple times, and that is the conclusion they came to.
I agree! But Teams will just ban the strongest of the meta. For example team 1 will just ban kiriko and team 2 will just ban sojourn. Then teams will just pick around the bans and will still result to repetitive compositions. That even happens in MOBAs even with upto 5 bans per team. Meta is meta for a reason and they are playing to win.  Ofcourse they will always pick the best comp to win. And unlike MOBAs, both OW teams can pick the exact same comp resulting to a mirror match.
Bans are more relevant when there’s actually counterpicks. The new direction overwatch is going is to have less hard counters, which subsequently will mean any meta picks won’t really have answers to shut them down.. and I suspect compositions will be become even more homogenized than in OW1. Sad, really. They didn’t need to change the direction of the game or rework a bunch of shit just to call it a sequel- they just needed to keep adding maps, modes, and heroes to the original.
I think they should allow independent bans (e.g. each team can ban a hero for the opposing team but can pick them themselves). I understand that OW doesn't have enough heroes for fully non-overlapping picks, but mirror matchups are as boring as they go.
Goats with junker queen I presume
    Yea it played very closely to GOATS but the comp was actually (Junker Queen, Sojourn/Ashe, Genji, Lucio, and Brig).
Jeans + GOATS
They tried something last year called hero pools were the most played hero in a previous stage was banned. Some people in the community loved it, some hated it. But I described in a previous comment that I personally think we will get to a pick/ban system. Just right now, there aren't that many heroes.
While that may be more entertaining it would be much less competitive that way.
Yea I'm an OG OW esports fan and the meta would develop slowly into mirror matchups in the past. You probably watched during those periods of meta development. 

For this playoffs they are actually playing on the November 15th Patch we are getting soon and according some people, they believe the teams haven't had enough time to digest the patch so they are running the best comp they can find at the moment without time to experiment really and break the meta comp. They had 5 days to prepare which isn't great lmao.
Yea I mean tbh it all comes down to what meta you enjoy watching. For me, I hated JOATS sooo much. I thought it was braindead (that was a very rigid meta). 

I enjoy this new one more (which is also a somewhat rigid meta that doesn't have a name).

People will enjoy different things...I generally enjoy OW esports cause I like seeing people play the game at it's peak but i don't enjoy metas hanging around for 6+ months. from August to now, we have had 3 rigid metas (JOATS -> Zarya Rush -> Winston Rush). So I am generally happy. 

In April, the meta was rigid until the gladiators broke it at playoffs and in mid-season madness we had the most fluid meta ever...people say that was the greatest OW tournament which I agree with.

But yea I get why people might not enjoy it if it was toooo cheesy.
WRONG
RIGHT
People get mad/disappointed because this game has 35 characters in it. It's lame to see the same 5 every single match
    i guess thats personal opinion, i pretty much prefer a small roster than having league model where they pump a new character every 1-2 months that is broken as hell. balance is also a pain in the ass with so many characters
    Haha which is entirely fair some metas are better than others *depending on what you enjoy watching lol.

Edit*
I'm confused. When playing sports each person has entirely different sets of skills. They are playing the same sports and are all human, but they have very different strengths and weaknesses in their game. Your comment makes me think you know nothing about physical competition.
    bro it was a joke...chill
This is more like if every single play in football was a forward pass.
I usually only play mystery heroes already
Or itd be a double down of toxicity and youd get the jackasses that get genuinely, day-ruining pissed off at mario party.
You'd get flamed if you didn't suicide until you got a 'meta comp', and then if they fixed that, flamed if you didn't suicide before dying to keep it.
Genjis would still say 'support diff'. They always do.
I would counter this with players would have to learn the art of throwing a death to swap characters. I played mystery heroes with a full team before and it's definitely a playable strat.
I could get with tanks having a little less hp
No way, there's an art to it
No way, there's an art to it
I was mostly being flippant, I agree that constant mirror comps is probably bad for the pro scene, even if it’s totally rational for pros to do it.
Ez. Heroes can only be used once per map.
    Honestly id be more interested in pro 5v5 elimination than mirror matchups

The game has the unique feature of hero swapping but its rarely used. Mobas are more interesting bc each team is forced to have a different strategy (or one team has heroes  that are better, like one scaling comp scales better in comparison)
cuz out of the 35 heroes and each role specifically there are some that played at such high skill that they are a bit better so this players that really want to win will pick the best possible team comp.
they prob also have to practice it in skirmish and stuff so its not like they will just swap to test something in the mid of the competition
    Yup, but some heroes could just be a bit better because of the difference between attack or defense, or for some specific map (or a portion of it) in which one hero shine more than others, etc.

I'm really skeptical about mirror comp, I'm sure it's the right thing to do for pros, but to make an e-sport attractive in the long run it seems terrible.

If it can't be address by balance changes, let's introduce a pick and ban system with no mirror allowed. It would at least spice things up a little bit.
        1. Hero pools and bans have been tried in different levels of play and typically don’t work too well. (The only time it’s worked is when 1 hero is extremely busted cough launch brig cough)

2. Pick and ban with no mirror, my team picks first we get Lucio and we just won, okay Lucio is banned we pick sojourn and we just won again.    
In other games you have a large enough roster for this, in Overwatch well only 1 hero has a constant team speed boost, only 1 hero has constant anti heals. It just doesn’t work yet
            If the team that get one specific hero first has just won then the balance of the game is simply busted, and will never be fixed no matter the number of heroes.

I'm clearly not convinced, don't forget that the pick and ban process can take many form. With many different restrictions and order. I think it could be balanced. 

If anyone has any idea to make the pro scene something else than mirror matchups I'll be glad to hear more.
            If picking one hero means winning the game expose how badly balance it is rather than the pick/ban phase being the problem
                The game is very poorly balanced when it comes to OWL, posts have been popping up showing 3 hero’s have over 97% play rate and I know Lucio has 100% 

This doesn’t happen in ranked, in ranked any 1 trick can hit rank 1 

It’s just a matter of who do you balance the game around
            Let's hope that they reach the amount of heroes to allow that relatively soon.

Honestly, mirror matches are just boring, no interesting strategic plays at all.
    kinda sucks tho. wish owl had  a faker moment where he pulls Ryze the worst champion in the game and dominates
Not to mention all this talk about "Overwatch is about hero swapping and picking what you need!" and then see the same 5 characters every game.

People use the hero swapping as an argument against bans, but why does it matter when nobody ever swaps anyway?
    Well it don't, this argument is simply not valid.
Because that’s how metas work, play the consistently best comp.
    The problem is not that pros play the best comp, but that the best comp is a boring mirror matchups. It's a game design problem, that devs (and not players) need to adress.

There is a meta in LoL too, but there is also diversity, some possibility to surprise people with a pick, etc.. To make OWL an interesting esport to watch, rules of the game need to change.
There will always be certain heroes at the top of the meta, and they will be played to death in the competitive scene. That's how it is in every competitive game, and that's how it will always be. Eventually a team discovers something new, or it gets patched, but until then everyone will continue to play whatever is deemed as the best.
    We know that pro players just play the best of the best at the top elo, it's not the problem.

The problem is that the best of the best is a 5 hero mirror matchup, no matter the game mode, the map or it's side, or player ability. It's just bad game design for an e-sport. 

It's absolutely boring to know that every match of the playoffs up to the finals will be the same compo of Winston, Sojourn, Reaper, Kiriko, Lucio. Every thing just look and feel the same, it's bad. (We're far from the LoL top meta here) 

Add to that that all team have generic names instead of the famous e-sport clubs we all know from other competitive scenes, and we don't even have time to know players and teams before just being bored of watching the same thing.

Add a pick and ban system, no mirror allowed, and it's done : the OWL is more interesting and diverse.
        I fully agree. I just watched DotA TI and now tuned for OWL and it is such a snooze fest.

I feel like the game is optimized for pros, but I want a spectacle, some big brain moves, out of the box counters, very diverse approaches, etc. But right now mirror comp makes the most sense, I can't blame them.
    “That’s how it is in every competitive game”. Wrong, want an example? The International for Dota just ended and out of 123 characters only 8 weren’t picked or banned. It’s not the same genre yes but you can easily put a ban phase for 3 heroes (one per class) and still have a decent enough hero pool for a match
its one of the reasons why I really don't understand who likes OWL...
More then likely if you love a off meta hero or something that's average when it comes to power your not even going to see anything cool with it in OWL.
>Why play a hero shooter with more than 35 character if it's to play only 5 of them...

Because a lot of the people getting on board lately don't *really* want a team-based shooter, they want a downright shooter.
    Well considering what I see in my games it's not true. The fact that some are more popular or more meta doesn't mean that people don't care of hero diversity. In fact it's rare for people to never change heroes for a whole match.

And we can't adress OWL and our casual rank match as if it were the same thing. So a bit off-topic.
[it's never been nearly as bad as now](https://twitter.com/PRE_owl/status/1587510063903768594?s=20&t=sCLfMvor4Ae5fd7H0aYVxQ)

It might just be playing something safe since the meta hasn't had much time to develop, especially on their patch
So if the best counter to a hero is that same hero, then there is no counter, just skills gaps and broken heroes. Pretty lame if you ask me for a game that prides itself on the notion of counter picking. 

Why does sojurn not have a counter?
which is a fine example of why the forced 2-2-2 (now 1-2-2) meta was a ridiculous idea 4 years after instating it in the game.  Game should still be 100% open Q

Would this still lead to a preferred meta? Sure, but after watching over 1 decade of starcraft 1 and 2, seeing the meta get rethought every few months was exhilarating and one style never sat around too long in the pro scene before blozz would tweak some stats.  Then again, blizzard balanced and cared about starcraft.  Overwatch 2 just seems like continually adding new and more powerful heroes than the last ones added.
    No thanks. Role Q was by far the best change to the Game.

I like not Watching goats and having more than 1 non-dps hero on my team regularly.
        sure, and the trade off means a lower skill ceiling and less overall meta options in competitive play.
Unplug the enemy team's computers
    They can't stop you from grabbing a bat and smashing their equipment.
The funny thing is that both teams are countering each other's Winston with Reaper. So there is *a* counter, it's just mirrored.
    And Winston is picked to counter Sojourn.
        And Sojourn is picked to counter enemy heads.
            I was really surprised that Widow wasn't more popular in OWL.

In optimized play where the goal is for everyone to play as perfectly as an aimbot would, wouldn't Widow be the natural pick for her infinite range oneshot?

I could understand in ow1 where it'd be physically impossible to get kills past shields, but now as well?
                You can get those same widow kills with sojourn without being limited to long range and with better alternate abilities
                    So in ow1, it really was just shields that stopped owl players from playing widow?
                        No, widowmaker is a sitting duck, and in all practicality a throw pick in 90% of instances. 

Why play widow if genji or Winston will be picked? Or hanzo? 


Now with sojourn, widowmaker fills no niche. She is the inferior selection in every case, soloqueue or in coordinated play.
                Depending on the map, attackers have picked widow to try for a grapple hook -> head shot out of spawn before Switching to sojourn in the play offs.
I feel like dva would play, she tends to eat the monkey and can dive healers?
    Except the support comp is Lucio and kiriko, good luck catching up to them lol
I don't think you walk back to base, you just counter pick when you inevitably die.
    If you die in pro leagues it's usually because you lost a teamfight. In that fight, you were also trying to kill them and you got ult charge, so you'd be giving that up while they're almost at their ults from the first teamfight
Something weird happened to me last night. I was trying to learn Widowmaker, but their Tracer kept killing me, and my team wasn't doing well. Then I switched to my main DPS Junker Rat who I'm very good with, and we started demolishing them. It's almost like their counter pick lost them the game.
This is exactly the reason why CS:GO has so many regular viewers. Its e-Sport scene is very approachable, even for people who never play a video game.

Players shoot guns, throw grenades, buy more and repeat.
    Imo CS is way too slow for me to get into, same with Valorant

But at the same time OW is nigh incomprehensible from a visual perspective
I mean you miss a lot in football but you understand where the ball is at least and I think thats the issue. The objective needs to be very clear and the way they get there too.
    Most of the time, the objective isn't even the 2nd most important thing happening.
Why not at least have a minimap?  The functionality is already there, they just need to find a way to display it.
    Would that really help? The issue with spectating isn't in the pre-teamfight setup. The staging before a teamfight is pretty clear. The issue is during a teamfight when all the particle effects let loose and you have 10 players all stacked right on top of each other. A minimap isn't really going to help with team fight clarity.
        When Winston jumps, it's nice to know who he's jumping to and where the rest of their team is.  A minimap would show how the rest of the team is responding to what's immediately on screen.

They spend a lot of time on dps cam watching them chase one or two kills.  While that's happening, I have no idea how the rest of the teamfight is going except for the healthbars, which don't tell me who is shooting whom from where.
    Youtube compression on OWL streams are so shit you will barely be able to make out what's what with a minimap in the corner. 

Now if they go back to Twitch, and have a main stream + a minimap stream, that would be nice.
        Maybe I am misremembering but didn't they for a time have the option on twitch to select one player perspective to follow on a side stream?
            Yes, back in 2019.
When they were on twitch they had that FP POV where you could swap between players. That made it so much more bearable to watch for me since I'd just watch heroes I liked without trying to take in a full 6v6 fight all at once.

Until they bring that back idk if I really enjoy watching it. Shit happens so fast I spent most of the time watching the kill feed.
Yeah, I think MOBA games are miserable to play , but are really fun to watch, meanwhile OW is super fun to play but pretty awful to watch.
I unfortunately agree. It’s such a cluster fuck and it’s really hard to tell who’s on what team. Especially when both teams are the samw
Same
So what about those of us who can tell whats going on? I have no trouble keeping up so I dont get these assertions.
    Congrats?
        I was waiting for a response like this. I guess theres no response to people who make statements like the person i responded to.
            What reply did you want? Did you want someone to call you a liar? Or perhaps try to fight you on your statement? No one is saying it's impossible to keep up with whats going on, or that there is no one on the planet that can. Was just a comment on how it's extremely messy to follow for the vast majority of people, which it is. I dont think casters saying that it's hard to follow can be taken lightly, when most of them have done multiple different e-sports.
                Lmao. People find football hard to follow too. Its about competence. messy to follow? Dont watch then. The casters also said goats was a great meta. They just say whatever.
Its easier to keep track when you're actually playing and fully focused rather than just watching
    Also, the shifting perspectives makes it harder to tell what's happening. Of course, they can't just leave it on one player's POV for the whole match, but if they did, it'd be easier to follow, albeit less interesting.
    Actually the complete opposite of sc2.

This was the game blizzard went full eSports on?
And it's toned down with just 5v5. Although 6v6 was a shield fest until it was ultimate popping time
I'm fairly certain if they have a prescription and don't abuse it then they are fine. It's an open secret in many esports, especially shooters, so maybe it's a don't ask don't tell type of deal too. It wasn't until a player leaked that most CSGO pros were on Adderall and gained media attraction that something was done.
because overwatch league is a blizzard run league. Not an open invite to anyone wanting to make a team. So the owner of a team might be one of those orgs but the name and stuff was set by Blizzard
OWL decided to implement a city based League more in line with traditional sports, most of them are run by the big esports brands.
    Call of Duty ended up taking the same approach when the league became franchised going into Modern Warfare 2019. So teams for CoD such as EnVy (Dallas Fuel for OWL) named themselves Dallas Empire which is (now OpTic Texas with the merger of EnVy & OpTic last year) OpTic under Immortals Gaming Club was named LA OpTic (if I remember) FaZe is Alanta FaZe. NRG was Chicago Huntsmen and so forth.
    That has been conned into buying their spot and regret every second of it.
        Which team did you buy?
            [Just leaving this here.](https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-and-cod-franchises-reportedly-owe-activision-blizzard-up-to-dollar420-million/)

They were promised that OWL would rival the best esport on the planet and turns out it's a monumental fiasco.

To be fair they did trust the company that thought they could rival LoL in less than a year with Heroes of the Storm.
As far as i know, a while back some games regionalized/signed a contract with US to represent different states. However, CoD league still uses their previous OG team branding like "Atlanta FaZe".

Dont know what happened with OW in particular but these teams i think were previous big organizations that were replaced with region organizations, but right now after 5 years theres no representation from this OG organizations on the league
FaZe I think technically might be in the league. I assume the large company that owns Atlanta Reign also owns FaZe since FaZe has the Atlanta spot for Call of Duty.
    Would be cool to know wich Orgs are behind the OWL teams, id rather cheer for a team i like/know than for a state of a country i dont even live in

Edit: just found out this:


London Spitfire - Cloud9

Dallas Fuel - OpTic

Atlanta Reign - Atlanta Esports Venture (the same that owns FaZe in CoD)

SFS - NRG esports

Seoul Dinasty - Gen.G

Los Angeles Valiant - Immortals/MiBR

Florida Mayhem - Misfits Gaming

Los Angeles Gladiator - Same group that holds LA guerrilla in CoD

Toronto Defiant - Same group that holds MAD Lions

Philadelhpia Fusion - 34% T1 (somehow, basically Comcast Spectacor holds 34% of T1 and owns PF)


The other teams just dont have any parent groups or owners that also own other teams, so they are basically 'new' organizations
        Some of them are easy to know because of color scheme of the team skins sometimes match up with the orgs team colors in other esports. Dallas Fuel is OpTic Gaming (formerly known as EnVy hence the darker blue that the team skins use), Outlaws USED to be OpTic Gaming (hence the green and black color scheme of their team skins) under their former parent company Infinite eSports (which no longer exists because they sold off all their assets, OG got sold to IGC then to NRG in 2020 then eventually being bought by Mike "Hastro" Rufail and merging his company with Hector"HECZ" Rodriguez's company OpTic Gaming. Eventually retiring the EnVy branding a few months ago in favor of OpTic Gaming's branding). Los Angeles Valiant is Immortals Gaming Club. San Francisco Shock is NRG.
            Yeah! Did some research and updated my reply with some owners and parents of this teams that i think might be the closest we would get to OG teams from other games.
I didnt know that Los Angeles and Philadelphia were in Asia either🤷

The point is that this OWL system is shitty compared to other eSports competitions, and its US fault for coming up with that ass idea of a league. Blizz based OWL on the north american sporting leagues
    "I dont even know why they switched from the "WORLDWIDE" esports system to a regionalized "USA" system"

That's what you said, I was just proving you wrong.

I guess spreading misinformation is OK as long as it's to make a point?
        It is a USA system tho, Blizz based the league in Northamerican leagues. Thats literally what i said, regionalized USA system instead of the worlwide competitions like Majors, Worlds, etc. OWL is the only competition from OW so its not like theres a league and a champiomship where OG teams face each other.

Also, im not spreading misinformation, thats literally what it is. East bracket holds Asian teams and 2 american teams that arent even close to Asia to just put them there.
            Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to defend OWL, and maybe you just framed your original comment badly,
I mean OWL is still a worldwide esport, just its financial barrier to entry and limited success have made expansion rather slow.

I personally don't care if teams are named after cities or esport orgs, my one gripe is OWL killed the Apex Overwatch League in korea.
I think if they forced them to run different teams (like with team-specific bans or something), it would be much more interesting.

As of right now, same roster is just boring.
Yes, when OWL moved to YouTube we lost the ability to choose which player feed to watch. That was huge for me (I got to watch how my favorite hero played and maybe learn something.)

I stopped watching when they lost that.
But owl is just scissors Vs scissors
I solved your issue, just don’t watch it
    but free crap
        Eyes don’t have to be on the screen. Personally I think this meta is great tho so you would be missing out.
    Good idea. I tuned into to see if it anything changed from OW 1, but nah. Blizz just doesn't understand that they need to actually balance their game before they add more characters it's hilarious
        You are wrong but ok. Maybe spend less time on Reddit and go play it for once.
            Haha I don't care what you think since I experienced it myself. Enjoy fighting against the same 4 heroes for the next couple months lmfao
                It’s pretty clear you lack a fundamental understanding of the game lol
Im sorry that you are one of the people that find every meta boring
Lol good one I’m masters on tank I just can’t play Winston. I know it’s hard for you to understand when you get focused in silver and last longer than a half a second.
    dude chill it with the fragile ego lmaooo you’re probably edging diamond anyway
        GODAMMIT WALTUH
He works regardless. Tank busting is more valuable than ever
My concern with that would be that mid-game hero swaps is a huge deal in OW.  Not being able to choose something that the enemy team can choose could be game loosing.  Even in games where you can't swap mid game, such as various MOBAs or siege, the bans typically apply to *both* teams to keep things fair. Not too mention that'd also mean that each team is only losing 3 heroes on the roster rather than 6.
    Yeah it might not work that well, considering the limited amount of heroes overall.

My biggest concern is that these teams are so used to mirrored meta, that they will might just fall back to it, so having different bans for teams should force them to do more interesting counterplays.

> the bans typically apply to both teams to keep things fair

Yes, but in MOBAs you can't select the same hero on both sides and you can't swap, so my idea is to allow slightly different roster while teams can ban best counterplays to their game plans.
People just want the free shit lol barely anyone cares about these nobody orgs and ass artificial league
yet the chat is barely moving
    Yep, at the tail end of the Day 3 stream (that is, right now), there are still 120k people "watching". I really doubt they were sticking around to hear commentators' insights on the games so far.
I have the stream opened in a pinned tab, but I don't watch it (it's a little bit too much for me). Don't follow the matches, or know any teams/players, only check to see if the stream is running.
I've had it on pretty much nonstop and every couple hours I alt tab over to see if anyone's changed heroes.
    Do you still get tokens if your stream is slightly behind?My stream keeps buffering.
        Did you put it at the lowest quality setting?  I'm not sure, it would make sense if you still got tokens as long as the broadcast itself is live.
That would just make 2 metas, which is what happened when OWL had rotating heroes. One week it was meta A the next it was meta B. People were complaining then too.
    Right, it all depends on the implementation. I think if bans are per team, not global, it should help with diverse teams.
No mirrored heroes would be extremely unfair. And even if they add bans, the meta will just be same team + replacement for a ban
    That's why bans should be per team so they can't mirror best choices.

I think it would be more fun to watch. As for unfair, they can fine-tune the ban system until it feels more fair but still fun to watch.
I refuse to believe that with all of the different heroes in the game that one single composition of the same 5 heroes is the only comp that can get the win. There was only one comp like that (GOATS) and that isn’t possible anymore. You mean to tell me that a Kiriko, Ana, Genji, Sojourn and Winston comp wouldn’t work? I find that hard to believe. Imagine a nano bladed genji charging at you with a Kiriko ult.
    Fine ill explain to you why your specific comp won't work since you obviously don't understand either macro or micro play.

Since tanks would be the same I won't be touching that

DPS- Sojourn is a good start, she's the best dps in the game currently, genji though isn't. Pros are playing  a patch ahead of live servers where genji got giga nerfed. Specifically they lowered his damage past a damage breakpoint (he can no longer rightclick + melee a squishy) and nerfed his ammo. This means genjis burst damage now sucks and his sustained damage now sucks. Since the other team is playing a reaper and Lucio and your team isn't, your monkey gets walked at and dies

Supports- Again a good start suggesting kiriko since she's the best support in the game right now. As for ana, since your traded speed for some extra healing, you now have no way of disengaging from a fight and your monkey gets walked at and died or your ana gets walked at and dies.

Ult Combo- Since, yet again, you are playing no Lucio and the other team is, they can just amp speed away from your nano blade, and if you want to use kiriki ult to try and catch up to them, you have now invested both support ults into a single fight, plus blade, and the other team could have just made it a dry fight.

Recap- The comp you suggested has worse neutral, worse engages, worse disengaged, worse ult fights, worse ult rotations, worse macro, worse micro, and worse active fights than what is being played in owl.

So once again, tell me you don't scrim without yelling me you don't scrim

As for what you said about goats being the only comp that was a must pick, apparently joats, zarya comp, zombie, and double shield never existed, good to know none of the last e years of ow just didn't happen.

Edit: Just because you don't understand why pros are playing what they're playing doesn't mean its just some random choice. These players and their coaches are competing for hundreds of thousands of dollars, they aren't going to be fucking around when trying to figure out what works.
People downvoting me because im right 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

interesting
So DotA2 is not competitive right? Because this is how drafting in DotA2 works
    Different games entirely
It introduces strategy element where you need to figure out how to outplay enemy team not just on mechanical level.

OW will probably get there, but in like 3 years, when there will be enough heroes.
Is issue isn't the number of heroes, but the fact that switching heroes mid-match is part of the core gameplay.

In MOBAs, it doesn't matter really how many you ban, because there will always at least be enough for all 10 players.
    Agree with you on this but I'd add it to my point.
    > but the fact that switching heroes mid-match is part of the core gameplay.

That may have been their intention, but it really isn't—at least not in OWL.
        Well they haven’t done anything to incentivize it… they even removed open role queue for a while
        Exactly. Ideally you pick strong generalist heroes that don't require swapping so that your players can specialize and master 1 hero instead of 10. You also never risk losing any ult charge.
            The idea of Overwatch was for there to not be mains and that you should swap to counter the enemy,

The problem was the 50 players trying to play Genji and get very offended when asked to swap when they're underperforming (because the enemy team has Winston/Zarya/Symmetra/Mei/Moira/Brig)
                The game can be very weird in that dropping your main isn't always the best choice because your performance may actually go DOWN in an attempt to counterpick.

For example, I play a lot of Junkrat and regularly see people swap to Pharah to try and "counter" me but they often have very little playtime on her and get killed even more easily than before. Usually because they'll go too deep in order to try and kill me.

Hero swapping has always looked cool on paper but been incredibly hard to actually accomplish. The best counter isn't always a hero that you're good at.
                    But sometimes you can achieve it with bare minimum of the counter pick.

And it's still better to at least try rather than to be bitter about it. Then again, it depends on the hero. If a Reaper is destroying our backlines I will still try to either take Cass to take him out, or Reaper/Genji myself to fuck up his backlines. If the enemy is playing an oppressive Dva, I'll go Zarya because just bare minimum effort from Zarya can tear her down.

But if the enemy team has a really good Cassidy, yeah, not much I can do since he fucks up almost anyone in a 1v1. A good counter for him would be a sniper but my aim sucks, but I still try to play Widow against him.

Another thing is, the game kinda forces a 50% winrate (or better yet, 33% near-guaranteed wins, 33% near-guaranteed losses, 33% games that you can somewhat tip in your favor), so even if you try to counter them your team will still not coordinate with you or help you out.

Always try to counter the team, I mean if seems like you're bound to lose, there's nothing to lose so try to take out their strongest player with their counter.

One of my most memorable moments of OW1 (comp) was when a Widowmaker was destroying us, so I begged one of our tanks (the one that was actually reading the chat and the only one communicating, they were playing good otherwise) to go Winston instead of Orisa, they said "BUT I'M YOUR ONLY SHIELD" and it took some convincing like "we won't need a shield if you contest that widow", then they said "but I almost never play Winston!" and after some yapping they reluctantly swapped, and then proceeded to asshammer that Widow for the rest of the match and she never even swapped. Then I praised the Winston for carrying us and they were so happy about it.
                        Sometimes? Yes. Often? No.

It's impossible to play on equal footing with all heroes and not every hero has an accessible hard counter.
    Switching heroes mid match is not a part of the core gameplay at this level, for the simple reason that it don't happen.

I prefer no switching heroes and a diverse meta rater than no switching heroes and a boring mirror comp meta.
    Even if each team got 1 ban per class (tank, dps, support) and said bans applied to both team's rosters, making for a grand total of 6 bans I feel like that'd greatly help diversify the team comps we see.  And just 6 bans, equally distributed among the 3 classes still leaves the teams with a lot of freedom for switching heroes mid-game to address whatever the current need is.
        I agree. Imo mirror matchups in a game with skills just are not that interesting, I want to see how they counter enemy formation in not ideal conditions.

I also don't care that they wouldn't be able to master 1-2 heroes, I want a spectacle, not the most efficient matchup.
            A game based around rapid swapping like ow would not work with locks like that though
                Why not? They would still have 30 heroes available.
                    Because the individual pools for things like tank and healers are fairly small and not being able to counter or swap to some heroes whilst the enemy team can use them would be dodgy.

You can swap heroes mid game, so unless both teams have access to the same picks, it’d be unbalanced.
                        Yes, it would be unbalanced, but the idea behind bans is to unbalance it for the other team while still being able to counter whatever they will pick based on current meta. It is not about ideal balance, it is about outplaying your opponent.

3 bans should not be that disrupting (1 per role). Maybe next year, when they have more tanks/supports? They probably won't do it anyway, but I firmly believe it would make it more fun to watch (I don't think it's needed in regular comps).
                        I specified that the 6 total bans would apply to *both* teams' rosters.  There wouldn't be an instance where one team swaps to a hero that the other can't access.
        > And just 6 bans, equally distributed among the 3 classes

For them to be equally distributed in **impact**, it'd need to be 1 tank, 2 damage and 0 support bans, though.
            Yeah sure, something along those lines would be fine too.  I'm just spitballing here so the total number of bans and how many bans each particular class get would be something interesting to explore.
        So how would that not lead to seeing mirror matches of the 7th through 11th best heroes?
            Ideally if teams ban the typical top performers for each role, who individually tend to be capable of performing what several other heroes can do, that'd open up some variability.  For example if Sojourn is banned, maybe one team who really values her for her ability to delete squishies from a distance will replace her with Widow Maker while another team who valued her for her extreme mobility will replace her with a Genji.

I feel like one of the issues with the top picks right now is that it stems from some heroes being able to do too much.  So instead of having to choose to we want to pick the hero who can do X really well or the hero who does Y, they get funneled into picking the hero can can do X, Y, *and hell, even Z* really well and from there they're also forced to pick heroes who can both synergize with that said hero and can serve as a counter since the enemy team is going to pick them too.  Give teams the ability to ban and hopefully that'll result in them having to mix things up a bit.
    I sometimes wonder if allowing players to switch mid-match is part of what makes teams all use the same comp.

Most team compositions have strengths and weaknesses. But if the enemy team can switch heroes at any time, then obviously they are going to exploit your team's weaknesses - every time.  So then, the only option is to pick the most bland comp, with no significant weakness to exploit (and probably no particular strengths either, because there is some balance in the heroes).
50+.. My children will love ow5
    Ow5 the ultimate 2v2 team base live service fps.
        OW4 being a battle royal was a hot mess.
> I think it will be more viable to have pick/ban system after we get like 50+ heroes.

How many years away are we from 50 heroes?
    It'll be 2030 and each hero will need to be purchased for 20$. Some of the pros will be forced to find new comps to fit around certain team members not owning and having paid for that character.
        2030 and our accounts are gonna be so valuable because we have half the dps and all 8 healers unlocked from being a legacy player
            and we'll be getting all hyped up for the Final Pre-release PVE Beta!
        Don't forget, it'll be Overwatch 3/4 by then too, and competitive, any new gamemodes, and maybe even parts of the maps will probably be sold as extras!
            There is no more game modes. It's just a custom streaming client you can use to watch pros play, but you got to pay each hero or you won't be able to see what a player using that hero is doing.
    in a few years.... behind $60 dlc
>Also, there have been tournaments with pick/ban systems in OW1 but people have picked and ban around the meta because they are good at the meta so it isn't a 100% deterrence from the meta BUT, I think it will definitely help.

~~People pick ban around the meta in MOBAs too.~~ People pick/ban around the meta in any esport.
Paladins had banning in ranked even when they had 30 characters, now they have over 50, and increased it from 4 bans (2 for each team) to 6 bans, 3 per team. It works great, cause everyone is in accordance and bans the brain dead annoying characters that require no skill which makes the game much more fun and skilled overall. Bans would be good for ranked, idk about OWL since it’s just metas in there. Ranked actually uses most characters, but I am so down to not have to play brain dead characters like Rat.
Yeah, there isnt a deep enough pool of heroes to make bans interesting. 

Plus, if everyone just bans 2 supports then oof.
    Can only ban one support. Wow that was easy.
        You are still banning 25% of the support roster, though. 

Like, bans would be cool, if we had more heroes.
            ??? 12.5%.
                Each side gets one support ban
                    Why? Who says? Just allow 1 support ban max.
                        Because there are two teams. Also I say since this shit is made up anyway. You tried to correct the person above you and are now digging your heels in when I clarified his reasoning
                Both sides ban one
            I said this in another comment, but **actually** balanced bans would need to be 1 tank, 2-3 damage and 0 support, *per team*.

This would try to presence the relative impact each ban has, given the size and variety of each roster.
That's what happens in R6S. Everyone bans Clash and the rest of the bans are just annoying coz now you cant play your main.
    Exactly, I get why people might think bans would help, but overall I think it would just be more annoying.
        It would be interesting if the system made you ban one hero out of tank, support, or dps - and that decision is random
            This did actually happen for a few weeks way back in 2018 just after the addition of role lock
    Btw we wan't pick and bans for OWL, not your usual ranked games.
Yeah. I would love hard meta over powered characters to be banned every game. Allows for variety and not just the same comp every game like OWL. We ain’t getting paid to use the same character for ever. Have some fun with comps.
It'd give them the option to show something cool. In MOBA games, bans and picks are situational, and it is much more entertaining than mirror matches
Not necessarily. They will ban here and there heroes where enemy is known to be really good at, and the other team can ban some counters to their strategy.

In ideal world, they should not allow same picks , but I understand that hero switching doesn't really work with it (not that people in OWL use it anyway).
They cant balance the current heroes in a timely manner, I wouldnt trust them with more
    They *can* balance them in a timely manner, they just don't want to for whatever reason. It's not like it actually takes them months to go and change a 4 to a 3 in the code.
        Yeah, I've never understood why they let things go as long as they do. They typically only want to balance in between seasons and sometimes mid-season. It wouldn't be so bad if they were transparent about their reasons, but they never are.

If they were like, "We know Zarya feels oppressive right now but internal stats show that her damage output and win percentage are in line with similar tanks. Here is a spreadsheet of our numbers. We will continue to monitor for any change that match player anecdotes."
Yea it played very closely to GOATS but the comp was actually (Junker Queen, Sojourn/Ashe, Genji, Lucio, and Brig).
i guess thats personal opinion, i pretty much prefer a small roster than having league model where they pump a new character every 1-2 months that is broken as hell. balance is also a pain in the ass with so many characters
Haha which is entirely fair some metas are better than others *depending on what you enjoy watching lol.

Edit*
bro it was a joke...chill
Honestly id be more interested in pro 5v5 elimination than mirror matchups

The game has the unique feature of hero swapping but its rarely used. Mobas are more interesting bc each team is forced to have a different strategy (or one team has heroes  that are better, like one scaling comp scales better in comparison)
Yup, but some heroes could just be a bit better because of the difference between attack or defense, or for some specific map (or a portion of it) in which one hero shine more than others, etc.

I'm really skeptical about mirror comp, I'm sure it's the right thing to do for pros, but to make an e-sport attractive in the long run it seems terrible.

If it can't be address by balance changes, let's introduce a pick and ban system with no mirror allowed. It would at least spice things up a little bit.
    1. Hero pools and bans have been tried in different levels of play and typically don’t work too well. (The only time it’s worked is when 1 hero is extremely busted cough launch brig cough)

2. Pick and ban with no mirror, my team picks first we get Lucio and we just won, okay Lucio is banned we pick sojourn and we just won again.    
In other games you have a large enough roster for this, in Overwatch well only 1 hero has a constant team speed boost, only 1 hero has constant anti heals. It just doesn’t work yet
        If the team that get one specific hero first has just won then the balance of the game is simply busted, and will never be fixed no matter the number of heroes.

I'm clearly not convinced, don't forget that the pick and ban process can take many form. With many different restrictions and order. I think it could be balanced. 

If anyone has any idea to make the pro scene something else than mirror matchups I'll be glad to hear more.
        If picking one hero means winning the game expose how badly balance it is rather than the pick/ban phase being the problem
            The game is very poorly balanced when it comes to OWL, posts have been popping up showing 3 hero’s have over 97% play rate and I know Lucio has 100% 

This doesn’t happen in ranked, in ranked any 1 trick can hit rank 1 

It’s just a matter of who do you balance the game around
        Let's hope that they reach the amount of heroes to allow that relatively soon.

Honestly, mirror matches are just boring, no interesting strategic plays at all.
kinda sucks tho. wish owl had  a faker moment where he pulls Ryze the worst champion in the game and dominates
Well it don't, this argument is simply not valid.
The problem is not that pros play the best comp, but that the best comp is a boring mirror matchups. It's a game design problem, that devs (and not players) need to adress.

There is a meta in LoL too, but there is also diversity, some possibility to surprise people with a pick, etc.. To make OWL an interesting esport to watch, rules of the game need to change.
We know that pro players just play the best of the best at the top elo, it's not the problem.

The problem is that the best of the best is a 5 hero mirror matchup, no matter the game mode, the map or it's side, or player ability. It's just bad game design for an e-sport. 

It's absolutely boring to know that every match of the playoffs up to the finals will be the same compo of Winston, Sojourn, Reaper, Kiriko, Lucio. Every thing just look and feel the same, it's bad. (We're far from the LoL top meta here) 

Add to that that all team have generic names instead of the famous e-sport clubs we all know from other competitive scenes, and we don't even have time to know players and teams before just being bored of watching the same thing.

Add a pick and ban system, no mirror allowed, and it's done : the OWL is more interesting and diverse.
    I fully agree. I just watched DotA TI and now tuned for OWL and it is such a snooze fest.

I feel like the game is optimized for pros, but I want a spectacle, some big brain moves, out of the box counters, very diverse approaches, etc. But right now mirror comp makes the most sense, I can't blame them.
“That’s how it is in every competitive game”. Wrong, want an example? The International for Dota just ended and out of 123 characters only 8 weren’t picked or banned. It’s not the same genre yes but you can easily put a ban phase for 3 heroes (one per class) and still have a decent enough hero pool for a match
Well considering what I see in my games it's not true. The fact that some are more popular or more meta doesn't mean that people don't care of hero diversity. In fact it's rare for people to never change heroes for a whole match.

And we can't adress OWL and our casual rank match as if it were the same thing. So a bit off-topic.
No thanks. Role Q was by far the best change to the Game.

I like not Watching goats and having more than 1 non-dps hero on my team regularly.
    sure, and the trade off means a lower skill ceiling and less overall meta options in competitive play.
They can't stop you from grabbing a bat and smashing their equipment.
And Winston is picked to counter Sojourn.
    And Sojourn is picked to counter enemy heads.
        I was really surprised that Widow wasn't more popular in OWL.

In optimized play where the goal is for everyone to play as perfectly as an aimbot would, wouldn't Widow be the natural pick for her infinite range oneshot?

I could understand in ow1 where it'd be physically impossible to get kills past shields, but now as well?
            You can get those same widow kills with sojourn without being limited to long range and with better alternate abilities
                So in ow1, it really was just shields that stopped owl players from playing widow?
                    No, widowmaker is a sitting duck, and in all practicality a throw pick in 90% of instances. 

Why play widow if genji or Winston will be picked? Or hanzo? 


Now with sojourn, widowmaker fills no niche. She is the inferior selection in every case, soloqueue or in coordinated play.
            Depending on the map, attackers have picked widow to try for a grapple hook -> head shot out of spawn before Switching to sojourn in the play offs.
Except the support comp is Lucio and kiriko, good luck catching up to them lol
If you die in pro leagues it's usually because you lost a teamfight. In that fight, you were also trying to kill them and you got ult charge, so you'd be giving that up while they're almost at their ults from the first teamfight
Imo CS is way too slow for me to get into, same with Valorant

But at the same time OW is nigh incomprehensible from a visual perspective
Most of the time, the objective isn't even the 2nd most important thing happening.
Would that really help? The issue with spectating isn't in the pre-teamfight setup. The staging before a teamfight is pretty clear. The issue is during a teamfight when all the particle effects let loose and you have 10 players all stacked right on top of each other. A minimap isn't really going to help with team fight clarity.
    When Winston jumps, it's nice to know who he's jumping to and where the rest of their team is.  A minimap would show how the rest of the team is responding to what's immediately on screen.

They spend a lot of time on dps cam watching them chase one or two kills.  While that's happening, I have no idea how the rest of the teamfight is going except for the healthbars, which don't tell me who is shooting whom from where.
Youtube compression on OWL streams are so shit you will barely be able to make out what's what with a minimap in the corner. 

Now if they go back to Twitch, and have a main stream + a minimap stream, that would be nice.
    Maybe I am misremembering but didn't they for a time have the option on twitch to select one player perspective to follow on a side stream?
        Yes, back in 2019.
Congrats?
    I was waiting for a response like this. I guess theres no response to people who make statements like the person i responded to.
        What reply did you want? Did you want someone to call you a liar? Or perhaps try to fight you on your statement? No one is saying it's impossible to keep up with whats going on, or that there is no one on the planet that can. Was just a comment on how it's extremely messy to follow for the vast majority of people, which it is. I dont think casters saying that it's hard to follow can be taken lightly, when most of them have done multiple different e-sports.
            Lmao. People find football hard to follow too. Its about competence. messy to follow? Dont watch then. The casters also said goats was a great meta. They just say whatever.
Also, the shifting perspectives makes it harder to tell what's happening. Of course, they can't just leave it on one player's POV for the whole match, but if they did, it'd be easier to follow, albeit less interesting.
Actually the complete opposite of sc2.

This was the game blizzard went full eSports on?
Call of Duty ended up taking the same approach when the league became franchised going into Modern Warfare 2019. So teams for CoD such as EnVy (Dallas Fuel for OWL) named themselves Dallas Empire which is (now OpTic Texas with the merger of EnVy & OpTic last year) OpTic under Immortals Gaming Club was named LA OpTic (if I remember) FaZe is Alanta FaZe. NRG was Chicago Huntsmen and so forth.
That has been conned into buying their spot and regret every second of it.
    Which team did you buy?
        [Just leaving this here.](https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-and-cod-franchises-reportedly-owe-activision-blizzard-up-to-dollar420-million/)

They were promised that OWL would rival the best esport on the planet and turns out it's a monumental fiasco.

To be fair they did trust the company that thought they could rival LoL in less than a year with Heroes of the Storm.
Would be cool to know wich Orgs are behind the OWL teams, id rather cheer for a team i like/know than for a state of a country i dont even live in

Edit: just found out this:


London Spitfire - Cloud9

Dallas Fuel - OpTic

Atlanta Reign - Atlanta Esports Venture (the same that owns FaZe in CoD)

SFS - NRG esports

Seoul Dinasty - Gen.G

Los Angeles Valiant - Immortals/MiBR

Florida Mayhem - Misfits Gaming

Los Angeles Gladiator - Same group that holds LA guerrilla in CoD

Toronto Defiant - Same group that holds MAD Lions

Philadelhpia Fusion - 34% T1 (somehow, basically Comcast Spectacor holds 34% of T1 and owns PF)


The other teams just dont have any parent groups or owners that also own other teams, so they are basically 'new' organizations
    Some of them are easy to know because of color scheme of the team skins sometimes match up with the orgs team colors in other esports. Dallas Fuel is OpTic Gaming (formerly known as EnVy hence the darker blue that the team skins use), Outlaws USED to be OpTic Gaming (hence the green and black color scheme of their team skins) under their former parent company Infinite eSports (which no longer exists because they sold off all their assets, OG got sold to IGC then to NRG in 2020 then eventually being bought by Mike "Hastro" Rufail and merging his company with Hector"HECZ" Rodriguez's company OpTic Gaming. Eventually retiring the EnVy branding a few months ago in favor of OpTic Gaming's branding). Los Angeles Valiant is Immortals Gaming Club. San Francisco Shock is NRG.
        Yeah! Did some research and updated my reply with some owners and parents of this teams that i think might be the closest we would get to OG teams from other games.
"I dont even know why they switched from the "WORLDWIDE" esports system to a regionalized "USA" system"

That's what you said, I was just proving you wrong.

I guess spreading misinformation is OK as long as it's to make a point?
    It is a USA system tho, Blizz based the league in Northamerican leagues. Thats literally what i said, regionalized USA system instead of the worlwide competitions like Majors, Worlds, etc. OWL is the only competition from OW so its not like theres a league and a champiomship where OG teams face each other.

Also, im not spreading misinformation, thats literally what it is. East bracket holds Asian teams and 2 american teams that arent even close to Asia to just put them there.
        Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to defend OWL, and maybe you just framed your original comment badly,
I mean OWL is still a worldwide esport, just its financial barrier to entry and limited success have made expansion rather slow.

I personally don't care if teams are named after cities or esport orgs, my one gripe is OWL killed the Apex Overwatch League in korea.
but free crap
    Eyes don’t have to be on the screen. Personally I think this meta is great tho so you would be missing out.
Good idea. I tuned into to see if it anything changed from OW 1, but nah. Blizz just doesn't understand that they need to actually balance their game before they add more characters it's hilarious
    You are wrong but ok. Maybe spend less time on Reddit and go play it for once.
        Haha I don't care what you think since I experienced it myself. Enjoy fighting against the same 4 heroes for the next couple months lmfao
            It’s pretty clear you lack a fundamental understanding of the game lol
dude chill it with the fragile ego lmaooo you’re probably edging diamond anyway
    GODAMMIT WALTUH
Yeah it might not work that well, considering the limited amount of heroes overall.

My biggest concern is that these teams are so used to mirrored meta, that they will might just fall back to it, so having different bans for teams should force them to do more interesting counterplays.

> the bans typically apply to both teams to keep things fair

Yes, but in MOBAs you can't select the same hero on both sides and you can't swap, so my idea is to allow slightly different roster while teams can ban best counterplays to their game plans.
Yep, at the tail end of the Day 3 stream (that is, right now), there are still 120k people "watching". I really doubt they were sticking around to hear commentators' insights on the games so far.
Do you still get tokens if your stream is slightly behind?My stream keeps buffering.
    Did you put it at the lowest quality setting?  I'm not sure, it would make sense if you still got tokens as long as the broadcast itself is live.
Right, it all depends on the implementation. I think if bans are per team, not global, it should help with diverse teams.
That's why bans should be per team so they can't mirror best choices.

I think it would be more fun to watch. As for unfair, they can fine-tune the ban system until it feels more fair but still fun to watch.
Fine ill explain to you why your specific comp won't work since you obviously don't understand either macro or micro play.

Since tanks would be the same I won't be touching that

DPS- Sojourn is a good start, she's the best dps in the game currently, genji though isn't. Pros are playing  a patch ahead of live servers where genji got giga nerfed. Specifically they lowered his damage past a damage breakpoint (he can no longer rightclick + melee a squishy) and nerfed his ammo. This means genjis burst damage now sucks and his sustained damage now sucks. Since the other team is playing a reaper and Lucio and your team isn't, your monkey gets walked at and dies

Supports- Again a good start suggesting kiriko since she's the best support in the game right now. As for ana, since your traded speed for some extra healing, you now have no way of disengaging from a fight and your monkey gets walked at and died or your ana gets walked at and dies.

Ult Combo- Since, yet again, you are playing no Lucio and the other team is, they can just amp speed away from your nano blade, and if you want to use kiriki ult to try and catch up to them, you have now invested both support ults into a single fight, plus blade, and the other team could have just made it a dry fight.

Recap- The comp you suggested has worse neutral, worse engages, worse disengaged, worse ult fights, worse ult rotations, worse macro, worse micro, and worse active fights than what is being played in owl.

So once again, tell me you don't scrim without yelling me you don't scrim

As for what you said about goats being the only comp that was a must pick, apparently joats, zarya comp, zombie, and double shield never existed, good to know none of the last e years of ow just didn't happen.

Edit: Just because you don't understand why pros are playing what they're playing doesn't mean its just some random choice. These players and their coaches are competing for hundreds of thousands of dollars, they aren't going to be fucking around when trying to figure out what works.
Different games entirely
Agree with you on this but I'd add it to my point.
> but the fact that switching heroes mid-match is part of the core gameplay.

That may have been their intention, but it really isn't—at least not in OWL.
    Well they haven’t done anything to incentivize it… they even removed open role queue for a while
    Exactly. Ideally you pick strong generalist heroes that don't require swapping so that your players can specialize and master 1 hero instead of 10. You also never risk losing any ult charge.
        The idea of Overwatch was for there to not be mains and that you should swap to counter the enemy,

The problem was the 50 players trying to play Genji and get very offended when asked to swap when they're underperforming (because the enemy team has Winston/Zarya/Symmetra/Mei/Moira/Brig)
            The game can be very weird in that dropping your main isn't always the best choice because your performance may actually go DOWN in an attempt to counterpick.

For example, I play a lot of Junkrat and regularly see people swap to Pharah to try and "counter" me but they often have very little playtime on her and get killed even more easily than before. Usually because they'll go too deep in order to try and kill me.

Hero swapping has always looked cool on paper but been incredibly hard to actually accomplish. The best counter isn't always a hero that you're good at.
                But sometimes you can achieve it with bare minimum of the counter pick.

And it's still better to at least try rather than to be bitter about it. Then again, it depends on the hero. If a Reaper is destroying our backlines I will still try to either take Cass to take him out, or Reaper/Genji myself to fuck up his backlines. If the enemy is playing an oppressive Dva, I'll go Zarya because just bare minimum effort from Zarya can tear her down.

But if the enemy team has a really good Cassidy, yeah, not much I can do since he fucks up almost anyone in a 1v1. A good counter for him would be a sniper but my aim sucks, but I still try to play Widow against him.

Another thing is, the game kinda forces a 50% winrate (or better yet, 33% near-guaranteed wins, 33% near-guaranteed losses, 33% games that you can somewhat tip in your favor), so even if you try to counter them your team will still not coordinate with you or help you out.

Always try to counter the team, I mean if seems like you're bound to lose, there's nothing to lose so try to take out their strongest player with their counter.

One of my most memorable moments of OW1 (comp) was when a Widowmaker was destroying us, so I begged one of our tanks (the one that was actually reading the chat and the only one communicating, they were playing good otherwise) to go Winston instead of Orisa, they said "BUT I'M YOUR ONLY SHIELD" and it took some convincing like "we won't need a shield if you contest that widow", then they said "but I almost never play Winston!" and after some yapping they reluctantly swapped, and then proceeded to asshammer that Widow for the rest of the match and she never even swapped. Then I praised the Winston for carrying us and they were so happy about it.
                    Sometimes? Yes. Often? No.

It's impossible to play on equal footing with all heroes and not every hero has an accessible hard counter.
Switching heroes mid match is not a part of the core gameplay at this level, for the simple reason that it don't happen.

I prefer no switching heroes and a diverse meta rater than no switching heroes and a boring mirror comp meta.
Even if each team got 1 ban per class (tank, dps, support) and said bans applied to both team's rosters, making for a grand total of 6 bans I feel like that'd greatly help diversify the team comps we see.  And just 6 bans, equally distributed among the 3 classes still leaves the teams with a lot of freedom for switching heroes mid-game to address whatever the current need is.
    I agree. Imo mirror matchups in a game with skills just are not that interesting, I want to see how they counter enemy formation in not ideal conditions.

I also don't care that they wouldn't be able to master 1-2 heroes, I want a spectacle, not the most efficient matchup.
        A game based around rapid swapping like ow would not work with locks like that though
            Why not? They would still have 30 heroes available.
                Because the individual pools for things like tank and healers are fairly small and not being able to counter or swap to some heroes whilst the enemy team can use them would be dodgy.

You can swap heroes mid game, so unless both teams have access to the same picks, it’d be unbalanced.
                    Yes, it would be unbalanced, but the idea behind bans is to unbalance it for the other team while still being able to counter whatever they will pick based on current meta. It is not about ideal balance, it is about outplaying your opponent.

3 bans should not be that disrupting (1 per role). Maybe next year, when they have more tanks/supports? They probably won't do it anyway, but I firmly believe it would make it more fun to watch (I don't think it's needed in regular comps).
                    I specified that the 6 total bans would apply to *both* teams' rosters.  There wouldn't be an instance where one team swaps to a hero that the other can't access.
    > And just 6 bans, equally distributed among the 3 classes

For them to be equally distributed in **impact**, it'd need to be 1 tank, 2 damage and 0 support bans, though.
        Yeah sure, something along those lines would be fine too.  I'm just spitballing here so the total number of bans and how many bans each particular class get would be something interesting to explore.
    So how would that not lead to seeing mirror matches of the 7th through 11th best heroes?
        Ideally if teams ban the typical top performers for each role, who individually tend to be capable of performing what several other heroes can do, that'd open up some variability.  For example if Sojourn is banned, maybe one team who really values her for her ability to delete squishies from a distance will replace her with Widow Maker while another team who valued her for her extreme mobility will replace her with a Genji.

I feel like one of the issues with the top picks right now is that it stems from some heroes being able to do too much.  So instead of having to choose to we want to pick the hero who can do X really well or the hero who does Y, they get funneled into picking the hero can can do X, Y, *and hell, even Z* really well and from there they're also forced to pick heroes who can both synergize with that said hero and can serve as a counter since the enemy team is going to pick them too.  Give teams the ability to ban and hopefully that'll result in them having to mix things up a bit.
I sometimes wonder if allowing players to switch mid-match is part of what makes teams all use the same comp.

Most team compositions have strengths and weaknesses. But if the enemy team can switch heroes at any time, then obviously they are going to exploit your team's weaknesses - every time.  So then, the only option is to pick the most bland comp, with no significant weakness to exploit (and probably no particular strengths either, because there is some balance in the heroes).
Ow5 the ultimate 2v2 team base live service fps.
    OW4 being a battle royal was a hot mess.
It'll be 2030 and each hero will need to be purchased for 20$. Some of the pros will be forced to find new comps to fit around certain team members not owning and having paid for that character.
    2030 and our accounts are gonna be so valuable because we have half the dps and all 8 healers unlocked from being a legacy player
        and we'll be getting all hyped up for the Final Pre-release PVE Beta!
    Don't forget, it'll be Overwatch 3/4 by then too, and competitive, any new gamemodes, and maybe even parts of the maps will probably be sold as extras!
        There is no more game modes. It's just a custom streaming client you can use to watch pros play, but you got to pay each hero or you won't be able to see what a player using that hero is doing.
in a few years.... behind $60 dlc
Can only ban one support. Wow that was easy.
    You are still banning 25% of the support roster, though. 

Like, bans would be cool, if we had more heroes.
        ??? 12.5%.
            Each side gets one support ban
                Why? Who says? Just allow 1 support ban max.
                    Because there are two teams. Also I say since this shit is made up anyway. You tried to correct the person above you and are now digging your heels in when I clarified his reasoning
            Both sides ban one
        I said this in another comment, but **actually** balanced bans would need to be 1 tank, 2-3 damage and 0 support, *per team*.

This would try to presence the relative impact each ban has, given the size and variety of each roster.
Exactly, I get why people might think bans would help, but overall I think it would just be more annoying.
    It would be interesting if the system made you ban one hero out of tank, support, or dps - and that decision is random
        This did actually happen for a few weeks way back in 2018 just after the addition of role lock
Btw we wan't pick and bans for OWL, not your usual ranked games.
They *can* balance them in a timely manner, they just don't want to for whatever reason. It's not like it actually takes them months to go and change a 4 to a 3 in the code.
    Yeah, I've never understood why they let things go as long as they do. They typically only want to balance in between seasons and sometimes mid-season. It wouldn't be so bad if they were transparent about their reasons, but they never are.

If they were like, "We know Zarya feels oppressive right now but internal stats show that her damage output and win percentage are in line with similar tanks. Here is a spreadsheet of our numbers. We will continue to monitor for any change that match player anecdotes."
1. Hero pools and bans have been tried in different levels of play and typically don’t work too well. (The only time it’s worked is when 1 hero is extremely busted cough launch brig cough)

2. Pick and ban with no mirror, my team picks first we get Lucio and we just won, okay Lucio is banned we pick sojourn and we just won again.    
In other games you have a large enough roster for this, in Overwatch well only 1 hero has a constant team speed boost, only 1 hero has constant anti heals. It just doesn’t work yet
    If the team that get one specific hero first has just won then the balance of the game is simply busted, and will never be fixed no matter the number of heroes.

I'm clearly not convinced, don't forget that the pick and ban process can take many form. With many different restrictions and order. I think it could be balanced. 

If anyone has any idea to make the pro scene something else than mirror matchups I'll be glad to hear more.
    If picking one hero means winning the game expose how badly balance it is rather than the pick/ban phase being the problem
        The game is very poorly balanced when it comes to OWL, posts have been popping up showing 3 hero’s have over 97% play rate and I know Lucio has 100% 

This doesn’t happen in ranked, in ranked any 1 trick can hit rank 1 

It’s just a matter of who do you balance the game around
    Let's hope that they reach the amount of heroes to allow that relatively soon.

Honestly, mirror matches are just boring, no interesting strategic plays at all.
I fully agree. I just watched DotA TI and now tuned for OWL and it is such a snooze fest.

I feel like the game is optimized for pros, but I want a spectacle, some big brain moves, out of the box counters, very diverse approaches, etc. But right now mirror comp makes the most sense, I can't blame them.
sure, and the trade off means a lower skill ceiling and less overall meta options in competitive play.
And Sojourn is picked to counter enemy heads.
    I was really surprised that Widow wasn't more popular in OWL.

In optimized play where the goal is for everyone to play as perfectly as an aimbot would, wouldn't Widow be the natural pick for her infinite range oneshot?

I could understand in ow1 where it'd be physically impossible to get kills past shields, but now as well?
        You can get those same widow kills with sojourn without being limited to long range and with better alternate abilities
            So in ow1, it really was just shields that stopped owl players from playing widow?
                No, widowmaker is a sitting duck, and in all practicality a throw pick in 90% of instances. 

Why play widow if genji or Winston will be picked? Or hanzo? 


Now with sojourn, widowmaker fills no niche. She is the inferior selection in every case, soloqueue or in coordinated play.
        Depending on the map, attackers have picked widow to try for a grapple hook -> head shot out of spawn before Switching to sojourn in the play offs.
When Winston jumps, it's nice to know who he's jumping to and where the rest of their team is.  A minimap would show how the rest of the team is responding to what's immediately on screen.

They spend a lot of time on dps cam watching them chase one or two kills.  While that's happening, I have no idea how the rest of the teamfight is going except for the healthbars, which don't tell me who is shooting whom from where.
Maybe I am misremembering but didn't they for a time have the option on twitch to select one player perspective to follow on a side stream?
    Yes, back in 2019.
I was waiting for a response like this. I guess theres no response to people who make statements like the person i responded to.
    What reply did you want? Did you want someone to call you a liar? Or perhaps try to fight you on your statement? No one is saying it's impossible to keep up with whats going on, or that there is no one on the planet that can. Was just a comment on how it's extremely messy to follow for the vast majority of people, which it is. I dont think casters saying that it's hard to follow can be taken lightly, when most of them have done multiple different e-sports.
        Lmao. People find football hard to follow too. Its about competence. messy to follow? Dont watch then. The casters also said goats was a great meta. They just say whatever.
Which team did you buy?
    [Just leaving this here.](https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-and-cod-franchises-reportedly-owe-activision-blizzard-up-to-dollar420-million/)

They were promised that OWL would rival the best esport on the planet and turns out it's a monumental fiasco.

To be fair they did trust the company that thought they could rival LoL in less than a year with Heroes of the Storm.
Some of them are easy to know because of color scheme of the team skins sometimes match up with the orgs team colors in other esports. Dallas Fuel is OpTic Gaming (formerly known as EnVy hence the darker blue that the team skins use), Outlaws USED to be OpTic Gaming (hence the green and black color scheme of their team skins) under their former parent company Infinite eSports (which no longer exists because they sold off all their assets, OG got sold to IGC then to NRG in 2020 then eventually being bought by Mike "Hastro" Rufail and merging his company with Hector"HECZ" Rodriguez's company OpTic Gaming. Eventually retiring the EnVy branding a few months ago in favor of OpTic Gaming's branding). Los Angeles Valiant is Immortals Gaming Club. San Francisco Shock is NRG.
    Yeah! Did some research and updated my reply with some owners and parents of this teams that i think might be the closest we would get to OG teams from other games.
It is a USA system tho, Blizz based the league in Northamerican leagues. Thats literally what i said, regionalized USA system instead of the worlwide competitions like Majors, Worlds, etc. OWL is the only competition from OW so its not like theres a league and a champiomship where OG teams face each other.

Also, im not spreading misinformation, thats literally what it is. East bracket holds Asian teams and 2 american teams that arent even close to Asia to just put them there.
    Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to defend OWL, and maybe you just framed your original comment badly,
I mean OWL is still a worldwide esport, just its financial barrier to entry and limited success have made expansion rather slow.

I personally don't care if teams are named after cities or esport orgs, my one gripe is OWL killed the Apex Overwatch League in korea.
Eyes don’t have to be on the screen. Personally I think this meta is great tho so you would be missing out.
You are wrong but ok. Maybe spend less time on Reddit and go play it for once.
    Haha I don't care what you think since I experienced it myself. Enjoy fighting against the same 4 heroes for the next couple months lmfao
        It’s pretty clear you lack a fundamental understanding of the game lol
GODAMMIT WALTUH
Did you put it at the lowest quality setting?  I'm not sure, it would make sense if you still got tokens as long as the broadcast itself is live.
Well they haven’t done anything to incentivize it… they even removed open role queue for a while
Exactly. Ideally you pick strong generalist heroes that don't require swapping so that your players can specialize and master 1 hero instead of 10. You also never risk losing any ult charge.
    The idea of Overwatch was for there to not be mains and that you should swap to counter the enemy,

The problem was the 50 players trying to play Genji and get very offended when asked to swap when they're underperforming (because the enemy team has Winston/Zarya/Symmetra/Mei/Moira/Brig)
        The game can be very weird in that dropping your main isn't always the best choice because your performance may actually go DOWN in an attempt to counterpick.

For example, I play a lot of Junkrat and regularly see people swap to Pharah to try and "counter" me but they often have very little playtime on her and get killed even more easily than before. Usually because they'll go too deep in order to try and kill me.

Hero swapping has always looked cool on paper but been incredibly hard to actually accomplish. The best counter isn't always a hero that you're good at.
            But sometimes you can achieve it with bare minimum of the counter pick.

And it's still better to at least try rather than to be bitter about it. Then again, it depends on the hero. If a Reaper is destroying our backlines I will still try to either take Cass to take him out, or Reaper/Genji myself to fuck up his backlines. If the enemy is playing an oppressive Dva, I'll go Zarya because just bare minimum effort from Zarya can tear her down.

But if the enemy team has a really good Cassidy, yeah, not much I can do since he fucks up almost anyone in a 1v1. A good counter for him would be a sniper but my aim sucks, but I still try to play Widow against him.

Another thing is, the game kinda forces a 50% winrate (or better yet, 33% near-guaranteed wins, 33% near-guaranteed losses, 33% games that you can somewhat tip in your favor), so even if you try to counter them your team will still not coordinate with you or help you out.

Always try to counter the team, I mean if seems like you're bound to lose, there's nothing to lose so try to take out their strongest player with their counter.

One of my most memorable moments of OW1 (comp) was when a Widowmaker was destroying us, so I begged one of our tanks (the one that was actually reading the chat and the only one communicating, they were playing good otherwise) to go Winston instead of Orisa, they said "BUT I'M YOUR ONLY SHIELD" and it took some convincing like "we won't need a shield if you contest that widow", then they said "but I almost never play Winston!" and after some yapping they reluctantly swapped, and then proceeded to asshammer that Widow for the rest of the match and she never even swapped. Then I praised the Winston for carrying us and they were so happy about it.
                Sometimes? Yes. Often? No.

It's impossible to play on equal footing with all heroes and not every hero has an accessible hard counter.
I agree. Imo mirror matchups in a game with skills just are not that interesting, I want to see how they counter enemy formation in not ideal conditions.

I also don't care that they wouldn't be able to master 1-2 heroes, I want a spectacle, not the most efficient matchup.

Now with sojourn, widowmaker fills no niche. She is the inferior selection in every case, soloqueue or in coordinated play.
Depending on the map, attackers have picked widow to try for a grapple hook -> head shot out of spawn before Switching to sojourn in the play offs.
Lmao. People find football hard to follow too. Its about competence. messy to follow? Dont watch then. The casters also said goats was a great meta. They just say whatever.
It’s pretty clear you lack a fundamental understanding of the game lol
The game can be very weird in that dropping your main isn't always the best choice because your performance may actually go DOWN in an attempt to counterpick.

For example, I play a lot of Junkrat and regularly see people swap to Pharah to try and "counter" me but they often have very little playtime on her and get killed even more easily than before. Usually because they'll go too deep in order to try and kill me.

Hero swapping has always looked cool on paper but been incredibly hard to actually accomplish. The best counter isn't always a hero that you're good at.
    But sometimes you can achieve it with bare minimum of the counter pick.

And it's still better to at least try rather than to be bitter about it. Then again, it depends on the hero. If a Reaper is destroying our backlines I will still try to either take Cass to take him out, or Reaper/Genji myself to fuck up his backlines. If the enemy is playing an oppressive Dva, I'll go Zarya because just bare minimum effort from Zarya can tear her down.

But if the enemy team has a really good Cassidy, yeah, not much I can do since he fucks up almost anyone in a 1v1. A good counter for him would be a sniper but my aim sucks, but I still try to play Widow against him.

Another thing is, the game kinda forces a 50% winrate (or better yet, 33% near-guaranteed wins, 33% near-guaranteed losses, 33% games that you can somewhat tip in your favor), so even if you try to counter them your team will still not coordinate with you or help you out.

Always try to counter the team, I mean if seems like you're bound to lose, there's nothing to lose so try to take out their strongest player with their counter.

One of my most memorable moments of OW1 (comp) was when a Widowmaker was destroying us, so I begged one of our tanks (the one that was actually reading the chat and the only one communicating, they were playing good otherwise) to go Winston instead of Orisa, they said "BUT I'M YOUR ONLY SHIELD" and it took some convincing like "we won't need a shield if you contest that widow", then they said "but I almost never play Winston!" and after some yapping they reluctantly swapped, and then proceeded to asshammer that Widow for the rest of the match and she never even swapped. Then I praised the Winston for carrying us and they were so happy about it.
        Sometimes? Yes. Often? No.

It's impossible to play on equal footing with all heroes and not every hero has an accessible hard counter.
Why not? They would still have 30 heroes available.
    Because the individual pools for things like tank and healers are fairly small and not being able to counter or swap to some heroes whilst the enemy team can use them would be dodgy.

You can swap heroes mid game, so unless both teams have access to the same picks, it’d be unbalanced.
        Yes, it would be unbalanced, but the idea behind bans is to unbalance it for the other team while still being able to counter whatever they will pick based on current meta. It is not about ideal balance, it is about outplaying your opponent.

3 bans should not be that disrupting (1 per role). Maybe next year, when they have more tanks/supports? They probably won't do it anyway, but I firmly believe it would make it more fun to watch (I don't think it's needed in regular comps).
        I specified that the 6 total bans would apply to *both* teams' rosters.  There wouldn't be an instance where one team swaps to a hero that the other can't access.
Each side gets one support ban
    Why? Who says? Just allow 1 support ban max.
        Because there are two teams. Also I say since this shit is made up anyway. You tried to correct the person above you and are now digging your heels in when I clarified his reasoning
Both sides ban one
So in ow1, it really was just shields that stopped owl players from playing widow?
