[[I ended up enjoying Scarlet Nexus, but I would not recommend it.]]


I recently finished Scarlet Nexus, and at the end I enjoyed it more than I thought. Given I'm not going to recommned it, I don't feel like going into length about the positives, besides in comparison to some of the negatives I will list some of them. So just keep in mind there are more positives, it's just I'm not listing them.

&#x200B;

The pacing crawls from about Phase 8-9 ish to about halfway through the final Phase. I found it rather difficult to get through that section of the game, not gameplay wise but will to play wise. At that point it felt like most skills plateaued, and the story wasn't really going anywhere. It was moving, but at a much slower pace, it's a fairly expositional part of the story which is rather boring in this case, and it just throws too much information at you. The writing is overall more amatuer-ish, the side-stories you get at the time have very JRPG/anime cliche moments/texts in them with some characters side-stories feeling like they were picked out of a template maker with no modification. I know that the side-stories would change depending on how you go about the game, but that's how it turned out for me. Part of the ability plateau was due to me not seeing a very fun skill where you get to use even more abilities at once, but at the same time if I had gotten it back then I would have gotten too used to it by the end so eh. But even accounting for that, the fights feel very samey in that section of the game. Final bossfight and last half of the last phase was good and entertaining though. However, the worst thing about the final phases is the side quests.

&#x200B;

I have seen a lot of criticism for the side quests of Scarlet Nexus. And all the points of not having any depth, being equivalent to fetch quests, and many being annoying are true. But at least for the first half, they can get you to play a different way, learn skills, and because they have no depth there is no guilt in skipping them. But around the last third they stop being free XP or ways to get you play in a different way (in a good way), to just being annoying and incredibly hard in the RNG and patience sense, not in a rewarding "I DID IT" sense. There is the lack of guilt to skip them, but if you want the XP to get a skill, good luck. At the end they are just stupid, I don't like them, and whoever designed them should feel bad. They have such specific requirements near the end they are miserable to try and perform.

&#x200B;

If you really were interested in the game beforehand and have the disposable income, go for it. You will probably fall asleep in the last third, but it gets good at the end. But if you just thought it looked neat, were on the fence, or didn't know about it; I see no reason for you to try it. I am underselling the praises, but I felt like going more into the negatives so here we are. 

&#x200B;

Also, for the value of the game, the music is surprisingly good. I will probably listen to some of it again outside of the game to get a better out-of-game view on it, but that alone is fairly impressive for a game.


Yeah, I was pretty disappointed in it. I had a lot of fun for the first 10 hours or so, but then the combat got stale, without enough evolution. And the story was absolute nonsense with awful characterization, one of those games where all the characters do is sit around and explain the plot to each other.

I did love the look of the worldbuilding, though. The way they had distant objects gain a hard outline gave it a really lovely classic manga look.
I bought this on sale, and have been contemplating if I should cut my losses and not play it. It looks beautiful (that's what got me). the demo was... okay? but I don't have high hopes. Your review on its flaws tells me what to expect, and I feel like the game will just be an ok experience that I can fortunately speed through guilt-free if I just want the story and pretty waifus.
I guess I'll be the outlier here and say I really enjoyed my time with it. It's certainly not particularly well written and has a good amount of "anime" flaws, but I really liked the characters and found the combat fun enough to pull through. It's also only like 20hrs for one route, another ~5hrs for the next since NG+ makes it a breeze, so it's not particularly long anyway.
I would not recommend this game as well. For me, this was without doubt the game with the worst dialogue/writing I have ever played - and I played a lot of JRPGs...
I got the game for quite cheap (8 dollars) and went in with very mixed expectations.  Most of what you stated is pretty much the way I felt. Game seemed to start relatively well and just slumped hard.  This seems like the kind of game where there are enough good points and enough bad points that anyone playing can find something to talk about.

Are the visuals good? or are they extremely repetitive? Does the art design suck from a very limited color scheme or is it interesting to see these places realized in a psycho-cyber tech way? Is the combat absurdly samey or do the telekinetic powers keep you interested.  I feel like wherever you land on each point matters on how you look at that aspect of the game. You can feel anyway about it and that's not really a great thing.

Great music though, credit there.  I just wish there had been more meat here than just the music. Story was almost utter hogwash, and once I got over not having a dedicated invincible dodge combat seemed OK. For the price I paid I'd say that's a deal?
Aside from being tedious, 99% of the sidequests don't hand out anything unique that you can't get just playing through. Idk if that's a relief or a condemnation 

The skill tree being able to be "completed" with the best skills (follow-ups, 4 SAS at once, ect.) on either story fairly early is an excellent choice for letting you experience a full kit for a substantial amount of time. I do wish hypervelocity lvl 6 was a much earlier rank though

The cast of characters is wonderful, especially on the bond episodes. I just wish we knew where tf Musubi was because how people on opposing sides can casually meet like that took me out of it a little

The thing with the final stretch of the story (BABE and onward) is how the POV is mostly around Yuito regardless of whether you're playing him or Kasane. Finishing the 2nd character's story can run stale when the only significant change is the final part of the battle against Karen

Combat on either side is always engaging, whether it's Kasane's relentless offense or Yuito's ability to stunlock everything to death with clairvoyance if you've the mind to dodge. Biggest bummer is not having some kind of max level mode, because the bond episodes do actually scale ðŸ¤”
It's a shame seeing these comments because I've had my eye on the game to go on a deep discount because it looked interesting.  Maybe I'll pick it up if it goes for like 5 bucks
    Like the game isn't even that bad. Its just in such a weird state of not that good.  Lots of real positives that you might really enjoy, but how many of the negatives you are willing to ignore can vary wildly. You might really like it, or you might get bored and drop it. If you had your eye on it, the game is likely for you.
        I'll still probably try it out myself.  Just seems like everyone finds it to mediocre overall with some highs and lows mixed in
This was on my wishlist and I got this on sale. I'd barely started before I lost interest. 

The combat is rad, but the story is dragging. I would prefer action moving into action. The world's been invaded by aliens. Why are we worried about who your sister is dating? Go kick some alien ass and save humanity.

I guess I wanted to feel like the stakes were higher, but the melodrama wasn't how I wanted it delivered.
I felt like this game didn't really know what it wanted to be. On one hand, you have fast-paced hack & slash combat, but on the other, the telekinesis takes way too long to charge and the dodge doesn't cancel attacks. I also found the game to be unbearable to play with Kasane since her attacks take too long to execute and have no forward momentum unlike Yuito.
    The telekinesis upgrades you can get massively change the pace of combat. It pretty much become an instant charge. But then nothing else changes.
I remember playing it and dropping it because my pc borked it it feels like the kind of game that anyone that likes slow and steady stories would like, the music and presentation of it is pretty fantastic tho.
I agree. I think I'm near the end of the game with Kasane's route but it's gotten really boring and felt like a slog to go through. The story doesn't help it. I've taken a break from the game and will probably get back to it just so I can say I finished it, even just one route.

My biggest regret is buying the Karen DLC. I don't think I want to play it anymore.
    Karen DLC? Do you get to play as him or something? I was under the impression that it was just more bond events and cosmetics.
        From what I know it's basically a bonus mission explaining Karen's motivations. Iirc it takes place after the main story. Haven't gone through it yet. The cosmetics are an added bonus.
Thanks for summary. I'm thinking about trying it out, as I got it into my library as part of some bundle. When better gamers start to get bored by the mechanics of the game, I tend to get to minimum acceptable skill floor, so I have high hopes :D
