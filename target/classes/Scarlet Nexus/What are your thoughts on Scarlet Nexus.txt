[[What are your thoughts on Scarlet Nexus]]


I know the game is over a year old, but I've recently found out about it through ps plus and it's got to be one of my favorite games of ALL time. It has such an amazing story that makes you want to continue to find out what happens because of all the suspense. Was wondering your thoughts on the game.


I think Scarlet Nexus was extremely fun to play but I have a few issues with narrative that are too big for me to ignore. I don't think the story was bad however it feels very convoluted at times and I hate how heavily it relies on exposition dumps to show the games lore. I also feel like Yuito's and Kasane's routes should have been combined because I think the story would work better if it was swapping perspectives throughout the whole game. Especially since Yuito's route is definitely the worst between the two but it's also very clearly the one they want you to play first so that Kasane's route can make it better retrospectively.
    Couple that with the way it was structured around the anime and I found it a bit frustrating to follow. I played it on release and the anime was releasing weekly so I was jumping all over the place story wise
    Yeah the anime combines the two routes and the story works way better, though it sort of fudges the middle
Good game but it gets repetitive quite fast. It definitely overstays its welcome. You‚Äôre supposed to play it 2 times but it‚Äôs not really worth it imo. 

The story is kinda dumb but it gets a pass because of its anime style
    >	It definitely overstays its welcome.

100% agree. Each characters sections could have been cut in half each. It just drug on for the sake of dragging on.
        Agree. I couldn't even bring myself to slog through a playthrough a 2nd time cause how how repetitive it got.
    >  gets a pass because of its anime style

Anime's Achilles heel.
    This. I enjoyed it a lot but eventually you just get bored and it gets really repetitive and samey. I never beat it once, but I definitely can't see myself beating it twice for full story.
    It's definitely because that last segment is way longer than it needs to be. I really did wanna play through kasanes route though but after the end level slog I just said I'll come back later.
It fizzles out. I liked it at first and then it just became meh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I recently picked the Ultimate Edition up for sale, I'm only 7-8hours in so far. I think it looks and runs great on the PS5 but so far it didn't really hook me. I will still continue for a bit and hope I get to enjoy it a bit more.
    I hope you can enjoy it! I really love the story, it makes me want to pick up and continue so I can get through all the suspense and get my answers, it's a really well written story. I also love the soundtrack for this game, really works well with the story.
        Thank you, I hope so. I will for sure give it a few more hours this weekend.
Pretty much loved it. Especially dropping chandeliers on them.
I remember combat being repetitive and the story at times making absolutely no sense.    
     
Imo they could‚Äôve done the crossover parts of the story better. When going through the male‚Äôs story, it was a surprise to find out the woman‚Äôs childhood‚Ä¶friend/sister had -spoiler- all of a sudden without any lead up to it. Then the female protag‚Äôs team is hostile suddenly.   
    
The holes get plugged in by playing the other protag‚Äôs story but the core issue remains: whoever you pick for the first go, you‚Äôre gonna have sudden and important parts of the story slam into you without any further details because those details are in the other protag‚Äôs story.    
     
So you‚Äôre left with this situation where you play through Protag A‚Äôs story, get to the ending, then start Protag B‚Äôs knowing what happens in the overall story so you‚Äôll see a bunch of the same information but now you get the details in the scenes from Protag A‚Äôs story that you were wondering about.    
    
I just didn‚Äôt like how it was done. Everytime I saw a scene involving the 2nd Protag, I knew I‚Äôd have to wait to play their story to even know wtf happened until they group up at the end.    
    
There were also several difficulty spikes. Memorable was the wind guy from the male Protag. With these type of games I like to stay as top top shape with gear and/or talent trees when applicable but the wind guy just slammed into me like a train. Legit thought it was supposed to be an near endgame boss from the story but nope.
Good game, anime and story of paradox and dimensional craziness was too much. A more gradual introduction was sorely needed.

That said, Code Vein is also pretty good.
Honestly my experience was very different. I was super excited for it and that died off fast. The game was good, but very average. 0 interest in another game like it. Story wasn't bad, but it was extremely annoying to have to play twice just to get the other side.
    I haven't started playing Kasane's version of the story yet, but I can see what you mean. If the story is different enough to keep me interested, I think I'll like it. I am loving the game while playing through Yuito's story, but I can see why it might not be as interesting playing it a second time.
        the second story is pretty much exactly the same near the end but very different until that point
        I did Yuitos during a Steam Demo and then did all of Kasanes in the actual game. I feel like Kasanes version is a bit more interesting from what I‚Äôve seen. Def worth the second play through
        I loved it. I actually played both characters at the same time swapping saves after each story beat.
Wasn‚Äôt expecting much but it really exceeded my expectations. The level design is my only real complaint, it‚Äôs very dated and you have to re-visit them a whole lot of times. Aside from that though, everything is pretty much excellent, especially the smooth gameplay. The story is good too if you like anime, otherwise it can be a bit cheezy and cliche.
I didn‚Äôt enjoy the game too much. I think I stopped playing right before the end and never went back. 

However, I think it had my favourite use of the resistance in the DualSense triggers. The special power mapped to L2 was so easy to feel when it‚Äôs time out had finished. I could just rest my finger on L2 and when it was ready I could feel the resistance click back in. 
The combat was hectic, so I appreciated this was something I could instinctively tell was ready to use, rather than keep an eye on another timer
I really liked, including the story that has (many) moments where it crushed suspension of disbelief. Seriously, I wouldn't recommend it to most people because it borders on the absurd. But I think the music, world building, and art direction is legitimately strong. The combat itself, especially mid to late game is extraordinarily fun.
I thought the game itself was pretty fun to play, but the story was absolutely horrendous. I don't watch anime and maybe this is normal there, but it's so weird that one second the characters are trying to kill each other and the next they will be texting each other and having friendly meals at a diner.
Amazing story?  Really?  I feel like we played completely different games.  The gameplay was enjoyable but I found the story to be completely nonsensical.  I mean, our main character has coffee dates with people who just tried to kill him a couple scenes earlier.
It‚Äôs kinda mediocre overall, I liked parts of it, but doing both campaigns was kind of a drag. Kasanes campaign was really solid, where as Yuitos kinda fell flat due to so much of the story making more sense in Kasanes campaign. Gameplay was really solid though.
I really liked the fast paced combat, and it looks nice and plays real smooth, but honestly, I think that was about it. 

The story, well, it's trash really, there so many plot holes, which at the end are just shrugged off rather then trying to come to a logically explanation or actually make a coherent story. I won't go in to detail because of spoilers. 

The bond episodes between characters feel like they have just been forced and thrown into the game, and again don't always feel very connected, especially when meeting up with some characters due to what's currently happening in the main story.

All in all, extreamly bad writing and understanding of certain subjects that become very integral for the story, but it's looks great and combat feels real good and fast.
    Thank you for sharing your thoughts! I haven't finished the story yet but I am near the end, I do understand what you mean. I'm glad that you liked the gameplay.
        Yeh the gameplay was great, graphics, music, can't fault that at all, I even got the platinum for it on PS5, and will prob go and do the plat again soon on the PS4 version. Cos if you skip through all the dialogue and bond episodes, it only takes about 8 hours maybe per character. 

It was just the slightly incoherent story which bugged me, after so much effort was put into the rest, was like the writers wanted to keep adding twists and eventually wrote themselves into a paradox which they couldn't fix
I liked everything apart from the combat. Didn‚Äôt feel responsive enough to me. I wanted to be more agile. Overall I really enjoyed it though
Loved it and platniumed it.
I enjoyed it at first, but after finally finishing the story I found it to be a lot of wasted potential. The gameplay and some of the cast were enough to get me to play as both characters, and the trophies were not a hassle. Compared to many other JRPGs I‚Äôve played in the last couple years, though, this ranks quite low for me.
Boring, flashy colors and pretty artwork but zero depth
Amazing, I loved the plot, combat, characters. Wish there was some more variety to monsters/areas ;)
Loved it! And then new game+ with the other character!!
Love it. Anime DMC with quality story
I like it. It reminds me of .hack.gu
I thought it was just ok, it fizzled for me pretty quickly, didn't bother to beat it.
I put like 8 hours into it before convincing myself I didn't want to put more time into it, the aesthetic design is cool af, but the story while intriguing wasn't that engaging and while the combat is fun, the enemy design and sponginess made it too repetetive and just not enjoyable, and the game is very bare bones in its design so with the story not really grabbing me and combat getting tired there was nothing else to hold my interest, if feels like a base for a good game but an undercooked one.
I think my favorite part of this game is the Zero Punctuation bit about how you‚Äôre two opposing factions killing each other but then all go and hang out at the same cafe or something and chat like it‚Äôs no big deal 

I don‚Äôt know how accurate this is and I‚Äôm afraid the actual reality might let me down so I haven‚Äôt bothered with it unfortunately
i liked it.  


i think they did the multiple protagonist style pretty good, but i didnt liked the story too much  


the gameplay is fun, i hope for a sequel\\prequel\\whaterver that will improve it
    Yeah, I've noticed that the determining factor for most players is whether or not they liked the story. I do love the gameplay as well, it is very fun in my opinion.
If you do jump in and enjoy it. Give Nier Automata a spin. That is a awesome game
The story was a bit extra for my taste, but the gameplay is what kept me playing. Really fun and engaging combat. I hope they do a sequel.
Gameplay and story were cool, but it got repetitive very fast. Did not finished it.
Absolutely love the combat. The setting and the lore are pretty good too. But I hate the level design. I would rather have an interconnected world than to have to choose from a list of locations to travel. Not an open world but something like dark souls and finally we need better enemy variety.
Tried it and holy shit it feels so generic! I could not pass the artstyle and how dumb the characters are.
Love it. Great combat. Well told story. Great animations and graphics. Great VO. Two protagonists with different stories. 

The side quest are awful though. Just ‚Äúkill this on this area.‚Äù Thankfully the game tells you where those enemies are so its not frustrating. I also wish there were more in-game animated cutscenes. Most cutscenes are not animated but when they are, they are gorgeous.

Super interested in trying Tales of Arise.
6/10; not great, but not bad.

Positives:

-	controls feel generally good and easy to grasp.
-	visually intriguing; reminded me a lot of what an updated Neir: Automata might feel like.
-	the Others were interesting concept for an enemy.

Negatives:

-	combat is wildly out of sync with the camera angles.
-	combat is very basic and repetitive.
-	character dialogue feels very odd, even for anime.
-	too many menus and submenus to navigate. Ended up getting lost quite a bit looking for the simple things.
-	the story is very generic
-	After playing as Kasane, I really felt no desire to continue with the other lead.

I started and restarted this game several times. Each time I‚Äôd get a little further and little further until I‚Äôd get to a point where i just had no desire to keep going. 

I think a big part of why this game has the issues it has, aside from the convoluted story and poor menu structure is that almost everything else has an air of potential that is never quite reached. The combat has some good and compelling concepts but never really seem to grow in meaningful ways. The armor and upgrades don‚Äôt feel particularly impactful or even necessary. The telekinesis was fun but eventually even that got repetitive once you picked up on the order of operations. 

To me, this is one of those games where I pick it up and go, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs neat‚Äù before going on to something else better after a few minutes.
Sell it to me! That's a game that wasn't on my radar at all and I don't remember hearing anything about it after it released.
Looked fun when I saw the vids but after trying it on PS Plus Extra I've deleted it after half a hour. It feels like a PS3 era games or something I would play on my Switch, so not on my PS5.
not having a block when enemies can have instant attacks that jump across the battle area really killed it for me, i hated having to dodge and attack a couple times and run away

combining the psych and physical is nice, the mods are nice but everything feels specific for that moment and there's no emergent combat even though they have like 8 systems
    That is a good point, if we do ever get a sequel they could possibly add one. I'd also love to see more SAS variations.
I stopped playing because the story just didn't vibe with me. I'm one of those people who will take serviceable gameplay if the story is good but I'll never play a game with a bad story and great gameplay. Exceptions are the soulsborne  games and metroidvanias because they are upfront about a lack of straightforward narrative
Having to play it twice kind of killed it for me.
Great game, great graphics. Typical japanese.
    Yeah lol, really good cutscenes too, classic anime.
I enjoyed it, but the combat got repetitive towards the end and there were way too many cut scenes and  dialog at the final few chapters.
    I'm in love with the cutscenes for the story since I just want to learn more and more to see how things are resolved. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!
The psychic powers combat felt too tedious. Maybe the guy is more fun? Wanted to like it.
    I believe you've played as Kasane, both Yuito and Kasane have the same special power but Yuito plays more of a close combat style, and his team and their SAS are different than Kasane for the most part. I'm sorry to hear you couldn't enjoy it. Thanks for your comment!
I'm playing through it these days. Fun game, but terribly repetitive combat. It doesn't understand when to stop throwing enemies at you. If each level had maybe 20% to 30% less fights, the game would flow much better. The fast pace and flashy ness of it all is really fun too, it just gets too much sometimes though.

That aside, I love the characters. I'd be very excited for a sequel too because the game does a lot of things well and if they were to fix the flaws, it could easily replace the Tales Of series for Bandai Namco.
    I'd love to see a sequel for this game, it has such an amazing story in my opinion, and I love the characters. There was that one key card level where you had to find like 5 of them, that one annoyed me a lot lol.
I was really hyped to play this game 'till I did. Personally, I think SN is a mediocre game. I gave time in my playthrough, did every bound mission that was available, I beat the game twice in order to experience both sides of the story. Idk, maybe I'm too picky or just it doesn't fit in my taste. I hope others have enjoyed it more than I did.
i really liked it, but i might have burned myself out by playing too much, because i didnt have the energy to do a whole other playtrough with Kasane, to this i tell myself ill do it someday.
all i know is that i bought it, one month later it was free on ps plus....NEVER AGAIN.
The gameplay was fun as hell, but I didn‚Äôt find that the story grabbed me all that much, so I still have yet to finish it‚Ä¶ that may be because of how atrocious the English dub was for the characters. The voice actors literally sounded like they were reading their lines off a script w zero emotion.
I just plat'd it last night. I loved the gameplay and graphics, but the story and characters are the game's weaknesses, for sure. I skipped every single cut scene on my second playthrough.
Good combat system,  but meh story. Control feel a bit sluggish, dunno by design or just fps thing.. since this is action pack game, i expect a more smooth experience.  Was playing on ps4pro if that matters
I always look at games to have 3 components at its basics: Art, Gameplay, and Story.

When I saw the commercials and trailers, I was super excited for the Art.

My rating for Scarlet Nexus‚Äôs Art is between 9 and 10 as I love cell shading style. 

So for those that places Art as the most important criteria, I can see how it makes the all time list for them.

Unfortunately for me Story and Gameplay I didn‚Äôt find them as strong, so I traded it away.
Mechanics are fun, makes good use of haptics imo, but I got a bit bored of it towards the end still would rate it a 7/10
Liked it but would have appreciated the ability to play as other characters. Liked the over the top story though.
Anime I don't like at all but I did get this game a while back and do like it over all but far from great. Still need to beat the game. Astro chain on switch is a far far better game that game is flat out amazing and hoping it gets a sequel.
Yuito is Kirito levels of cringe. Im tired aloof anime protags who repeat everything said to them. 

Also the games story keeps throwing wild twists at you without acknowledging twists from like an hour ago so you‚Äôre left wondering if anything is ever going to get resolved 

Spoiler!!:

Naomi being turned into an other was a major event in the beginning of the game and you play the game for 20 fucking hours wondering what happened and then Kasane randomly drops that she died in the optional Persona style bonding session! Like why???? That was a big thing.
It was amazing and the controls remind me of galaxy rush also the music and art style with the reds, whites, and blacks 10/10 I pre ordered it as soon as I could
It was a fun play.  As others said it does sort of get repetitive but it had an interesting enough story to still beat it once.
It was fine. The mechanics were fun even if it didn't have ton of depth. The story? I thought was kind of mediocre and very meh. The side quests barely make sense given the situation you are in during the story. I like my JRPG with a good story. So this didn't really impress me.
so i'm near the half way point. (chapter 10 out of 12 on yurito, one of the two characters). initial thoughts are:

1. good story. not earth shattering, but good
2. the cutscenes are a little dry. (they're VERY long comicbook style cutscenes, which is to say screenshot in the background then a head pops in with an animated mouth for a conversation rather than actual in game cutscenes)
3. combat is pretty nice (but the targeting is kind of wonky)
4. WAY too linear to the point it starts to feel kind of repetitive
5. great sound track.
6. very cool art style

that probably sounds more negative than intended. game is one of those "good games that's definitely worth playing, just don't expect a game of the year contender".

whatever someone's scale for "slightly above average" is, that's how this would rate.
I got past the tutorial and made my way to the shrine, that was as much as I played. I'll have to give it another try, but it didn't hook me as much as I thought it would.
love the game, my only gripe was the still picture cut scenes. It's clear they didn't had much budget for that part lol.
Found it a bit repetitive and started to grow tired of it by the end, but overall a good experience. Scarlet Nexus was my second game on PlayStation 5, so I was excited to spend time on my new console and ended up grabbing the Platinum Trophy.
I turned the music off and put on hardcore. Synchronized really well with the gameplay and I could just zone out during the boring cutscenes. This made for a really good experience, to be honest, one of my most enjoyed games recently.
Its alright. Played Kisane first, finished , then uninstalled.
I bought it, never played it, heard all the negativity, sold it.
Pretty cool premise and decent execution. Definitely got a little bored of it though. The steamdeck runs it really well too.
I tried the demo before it came out, thinking it looked interesting.  

Just really didn't enjoy the combat.  People likened it to Nier or other Platinum-style games, but I completely disagree.  Felt very stiff.  

If you want an anime-looking game with much better combat, I'd recommend Code Vein.  Souls-like (not quite as good), but cool builds and really good voice acting.  Precursor to the God Eater series.
Man I LOVEDDDDDD it. The story‚Äôs mystery was interesting, the combat was smooth and responsive as hell, and the characters were very likable too. It‚Äôs a must play if you like shonen anime.
Heavily underrated. The gameplay was a bit repetitive, but it I managed to look past it due to it being a completely new IP. Also the music in the gane is just *chefs kiss*
It's what Code Vein should have been.
I really enjoyed it. I don‚Äôt play too many anime style games which at first concerned me, but all in all it was very solid. Gameplay was enjoyable, story was good enough that I even watched the anime.
As a fan of JRPGs I didn't like it. IDK why, I got the platinum but it just didn't spark joy.
Excellent. But I only did one playthrough - couldn't be asked for Kasane.
I thought it was boring and repetitive. The load times are atrocious, and the story was meh.

You need to play through both character's campaign to get the platinum trophy but then only a few chapters are different. It's just replaying the same exact game with a different character. Nier Automata was able to make you play 3 different characters with minimal overlap even though it's the same timeline/story.
got the plat. enjoyed the combat and some of the relationship stuff. i didn‚Äôt like the story much tho.
The gameplay is fun, but the story is definitely one of the stories of all time
Story and combat is fun, but gets repetitive fast.
Been a while since I played it, but I remember enjoying it despite it getting repetitive.

I didn't play through the entire game twice like it's designed to do, but playing the first 5-6 hours of the other MCs storyline was enough for me to fill in the blanks.
Combat is pretty good but the story and dialog are trash.
People on Reddit completely dogpiled on the game and I don‚Äôt know why. It‚Äôs an extremely fun action game that feels amazing on PS5 and it has a captivating story and characters.
Fantastic game.  I put a ton of hours into it and though I didn‚Äôt finish it if a 2 game gets announced I‚Äôll be happy to go back and finish it for a sequel
Yeah Stay its welcome but a pretty good story would give it 8/10 solid but should get a sequel but make story moreover intersting and less over welcome gameplay
Loved it, fun combat that improves as you gain more abilities. Story was ridiculous but still enjoyable.

Biggest complaint was all the pointless annoying sidequests.
The problem is the anime style is geared towards the 12-18 year old demographic and the entire tropes and cliches that came with it. Rather than building for the 18-30 year old anime market which is a lot more adult like.

The story was down right cringe at some points. The relationship building aspect felt more like a chore rather than anything fun. I liked it for scratching the anime itch. But it was very repetitive.

I‚Äôm hoping that Blue Protocol and Honkai Star Rail end up saving the anime genre from a video game standpoint. We desperately need good anime games that are not tied to major franchise (DBZ, One Man punch, Naruto, et ).
It was ok. Didn't hook me like Tales of Arise, but the characters were interesting and the art style is really good if you like anime. I enjoyed it for what it was, a stylish hack and slasher with pretty fun combat, a bonkers story, and mostly likeable characters.
They dropped the ball hard on the cut scenes being almost still images. There were a few actual cut scenes in the game and they looked fantastic. Why they chose to cheap out on them is truly a mystery to me.
I enjoyed it.  Very basic in a lot of ways. Minimal items minimal weapons. Doing both stories gives you different combat styles and different perspectives on the story. It feels like a solid starting point and a sequel that builds on it could really be great!
Honestly, the 2 characters different point of view is a waste if there's no true route or something. I mean the creator literally said it probably would've been M rated since what they originally had was more darker.
Looks great, plays great, story was oof
I like the look of the environment and the characters the music if great gameplay is pretty good I have it on PS4. I haven't beat it but it is good. It's certainly different.
Oh great, I just finished this game 2 or 3 days ago. Here's my own opinion. If you like JRPGs, you definitely have to try it. The combat mechanics, story dynamic is pretty much similar to ToA, that is to say very good. You'll find yourself overwhelmed by the combat at first, but it gradually gets easier as it gets repetitive. Open-world as it may be, er.., I wouldn't put past that. It's linear like ToA, and the only sights you get to behold are futuristic cities and stuff. The difficulty of the game is hella easy imo, you can casually start with Hard mode and still have a standard playthrough. There's 12 phases of the story and you can play both protagonists' sides (recommend doing Yuito's story first) 

Well to summarize, the good parts of this game are the story (especially the story, it's very anime-like pacing) and the combat, but it can get pretty repetitive and dull. But hey, if you're like me who gets sucked into all the action, then you won't get any complaints.
I'm with you OP, I love the game world and feel like it's super fun. Haven't finished it yet but it seems pretty polarizing. Love the combat in it and the plot is interesting so far.
Former Major General Karen Fubuki!

Combat is great, rest of the game is meh.
Here I'm scrolling through the quality posts and then i stepped on this shit.
Currently playing Scarlet Nexus on my steam deck. Liking it so far. Evading enemies is satisfying for some reason.
I loved this game, the atmosphere, the setting, the art style, the gameplay, everything. It really resonated with me
Code vein is better in everything as a weeb game.
Trash nexus is a dmc wannabe
Like it, cool game but definitely not a favorite of mine. 

Favorite is reserved for souls games, The Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption and Ape Escape games.
I liked the gameplay a lot. I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the art style though‚Ä¶just a personal preference‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbad‚Äù.
So the story is worse than generic and the characters are even worse‚Ä¶but the soundtrack is great ([it‚Äôs the top track for a reason](https://open.spotify.com/track/4iQ9R2biGAAcRh6ETUtqXG?si=WYIMK-K2S0iBRWyrrLinQw)) and the combat is very good; reminds me of Kingdom Hearts; it‚Äôs got a satisfying way to finish enemies. Unfortunately the bulk of the character interaction are of these still images that don‚Äôt even take up the whole screen; it feels like a screen displaying a smaller screen and it moves a tiny bit, it‚Äôs quite annoying.
Bad.

You are better of playing dmc
Scarlet Nexus is the definition of "shallow".

The combat is fun but gets repetitive super fast, the bonding aspect boils down to a series of surprisingly uninteresting cutscenes that only serve as huge loading screens before you get the combat perk you really want and the storytelling is some of the worst i've seen in any game. A lot of scenes don't have the impact they were meant to because the devs chose this lazy storytelling method based on still images and it's hard to follow action scenes when they are being presented this way too.

The game is far from bad, it's pretty fun if you stick to it but i still haven't finished it because usually some other (more interesting) game comes along and i just can't be bothered to go back to it. I have a ton of shit to play and while entertaining in a vaccum it's pretty far down my list of priorities. It just doesn't have much going for it besides its aesthetics.
Combat and enemy variety were great. Story sucks. Have to play essentially the same exact game twice to complete it, and the characters aren't noticeably different to play as imo. Side quests were a slog of running through the same exact areas a second time. Combat is fun, but there is too much of it at times and it can begin to feel like a chore, even though the system is fun and unique. Strong 6/10 game. I'd be interested in a sequel.
The combat is hella fun. I‚Äôd only buy it for super cheap
I really liked it until about halfway through the final act and I was just over the game play. Someone else made the comment that it overstayed it's welcome and that is probably the best way to describe it. I would totally recommend the game to anyone who likes that genre of game.
I played Yuito on Ng+ for like 2 Hrs and Kasane for my first playthrough. Combat was extremely fun for Kasane, and her allies are BROKEN. Kasane using her team‚Äôs powers allows you to blitz and cheese so many enemies. Didn‚Äôt really like Yuito‚Äôs gameplay to much, but i also didn‚Äôt play him enough. Story wise the game is nothing special. It‚Äôs average at best that tries really hard to be a great story. Overall i‚Äôd give the game like a 7.5/10 or a 7.
I actually purchased this basically right before they announced it coming to PS+ and I‚Äôve been wanting to start a new game. I‚Äôm torn between Scarlet Nexus or Prey. Heard nothing but good things from both.
I bought it on disc when it was on sale alone with dlc,  I dont think I got farther and 10 hours in. got as far as the safe house and stop
I mean, it's a solid 6.5-7/10. Good game, not necessarily worth a play through as I don't think it's anything too special.
It is amazing
Couple that with the way it was structured around the anime and I found it a bit frustrating to follow. I played it on release and the anime was releasing weekly so I was jumping all over the place story wise
Yeah the anime combines the two routes and the story works way better, though it sort of fudges the middle
>	It definitely overstays its welcome.

100% agree. Each characters sections could have been cut in half each. It just drug on for the sake of dragging on.
    Agree. I couldn't even bring myself to slog through a playthrough a 2nd time cause how how repetitive it got.
>  gets a pass because of its anime style

Anime's Achilles heel.
This. I enjoyed it a lot but eventually you just get bored and it gets really repetitive and samey. I never beat it once, but I definitely can't see myself beating it twice for full story.
It's definitely because that last segment is way longer than it needs to be. I really did wanna play through kasanes route though but after the end level slog I just said I'll come back later.
I hope you can enjoy it! I really love the story, it makes me want to pick up and continue so I can get through all the suspense and get my answers, it's a really well written story. I also love the soundtrack for this game, really works well with the story.
    Thank you, I hope so. I will for sure give it a few more hours this weekend.
I haven't started playing Kasane's version of the story yet, but I can see what you mean. If the story is different enough to keep me interested, I think I'll like it. I am loving the game while playing through Yuito's story, but I can see why it might not be as interesting playing it a second time.
    the second story is pretty much exactly the same near the end but very different until that point
    I did Yuitos during a Steam Demo and then did all of Kasanes in the actual game. I feel like Kasanes version is a bit more interesting from what I‚Äôve seen. Def worth the second play through
    I loved it. I actually played both characters at the same time swapping saves after each story beat.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts! I haven't finished the story yet but I am near the end, I do understand what you mean. I'm glad that you liked the gameplay.
    Yeh the gameplay was great, graphics, music, can't fault that at all, I even got the platinum for it on PS5, and will prob go and do the plat again soon on the PS4 version. Cos if you skip through all the dialogue and bond episodes, it only takes about 8 hours maybe per character. 

It was just the slightly incoherent story which bugged me, after so much effort was put into the rest, was like the writers wanted to keep adding twists and eventually wrote themselves into a paradox which they couldn't fix
Yeah, I've noticed that the determining factor for most players is whether or not they liked the story. I do love the gameplay as well, it is very fun in my opinion.
That is a good point, if we do ever get a sequel they could possibly add one. I'd also love to see more SAS variations.
Yeah lol, really good cutscenes too, classic anime.
I'm in love with the cutscenes for the story since I just want to learn more and more to see how things are resolved. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!
I believe you've played as Kasane, both Yuito and Kasane have the same special power but Yuito plays more of a close combat style, and his team and their SAS are different than Kasane for the most part. I'm sorry to hear you couldn't enjoy it. Thanks for your comment!
I'd love to see a sequel for this game, it has such an amazing story in my opinion, and I love the characters. There was that one key card level where you had to find like 5 of them, that one annoyed me a lot lol.
Agree. I couldn't even bring myself to slog through a playthrough a 2nd time cause how how repetitive it got.
Thank you, I hope so. I will for sure give it a few more hours this weekend.
