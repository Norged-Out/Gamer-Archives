[[Every time after you beat a palace]]





Joker sends out a group text:

IF ANYONE APPROACHES ME AT THE TRAIN STATION IN THE MORNING AND TRIES TO PASSIVE AGGRESSIVELY GUILT ME INTO INFILTRATING THE PALACE AFTER SCHOOL I SWEAR WE ARENT GOING FOR 2 WEEKS
    [deleted]
        there are even some days where I'm like "yeah it's about time to head into the palace" and then everyone's like "Joker lets go to the palace >:(" and now I have to chill with Takemi out of spite
            “Hey lets go to the palace today” 



Well guess I’m banging my teacher today.
            I do the same shit XD
            Even if you are already max with her
    Palace or Mementos like please guys chill, let me get more targets.
        Shouldn’t we tell the others about that target in Mementos?
    I really need to work on the burger challenge and banging Makoto, so no palace yet
    I will always and forever accept the poor traumatized children being anxious to go metaversing when the alternative is hearing your party members go "actually, I'm tired and not going to Tartarus tonight. Good luck nerd." even if that fits the theme of its own game.
    Exactly 
I wish I could get him to say that
    I even got to a point where I stopped wanting to hang out with my party members before completing a palace because I got tired of their reactions. Worst is Yusuke’s.
    I'm be like: Screw you guys, I'm sticking to walkthrough in GameFAQs calendar

    have some god damn... FAITH!
        ARTHUR
            All we need to do, is get a BOAT, Arthur, then we'll SAIL to Tahiti
                One LAST job!
                    This is it gentlemen, the last one!...but we need money.
                        Dutch: I have a plan John.

John: You always got a plan Dutch.

Dutch: This is a good one >!Jumps off a fucking cliff*...!<
    There are two options in life: You either get guilt tripped into entering the palace for two weeks, or you deal with your teammates constantly worrying about whether the change of heart worked.
    The one time they had confidence that it'd work out, Okumura died, so uh...
        Sounds like my self confidence
        [deleted]
            >!Just as Dr. Maruki planned!<
                That honestly would be my ideal world.
                Just so you know, even when you spoiler tag it it’s still visible in someones notifications.

Even if it doesn’t matter in this case.
            Now wait just a minute that’s not OK.
                Please just let me believe this game has no major flaws. Let me have this.
                    I would, but Haru joins the party during that part. A great evil leads to you getting best girl.
                wait, ain't that bad?
    Well it's not supposed to be a liked feature, it's supposed to simulate all your teenage highschool friends stressing the fuck out and having an internal crisis at the fact that they're risking the lives of themselves and others.

Putting up with that bullshit is what being a leader is.
        [deleted]
            I dunno, stressing out and incessantly texting your friends about it is what high school's all about for a lot of people, no?
                [deleted]
                    I mean, you probably weren’t, you know, a world-famous criminal doing metaphysical crime with all your friends.

They have good reason to worry. And, at least for the first few palaces and after Okumura, they really couldn’t say for sure if their weird method would always work properly or not. Some skepticism is a good idea.

So, yeah, I think it was kinda annoying, but not terribly unrealistic or as whiny as you think.

Edit: added second and third paragraphs because I hit post too soon
                    The point is that Joker is a non-average teenager who does not tell them to shut the fuck up, which is why he's a good leader.
                        He's got the patience of a saint. You can only say "don't worry about it" so many times.
After Kamoshida: "I agree with you guys. Morgana didn't seem too sure about what happens so I'm pretty anxious."

After Madarame: "I'm also still uneasy. Not as much as last time; but who's to say that stealing the treasure will have the same effect on every person with a palace? I'm not tripping or anything but I'm still not 100% relaxed."

After Kaneshiro: "... Guys. Come on. It's just silly now."
    Kaneshiro: "I deleted the pictures and also don't worry about the money."

The Phantom Thieves: "Do you think it worked?!?"
        Kaneshiro: “I am unilaterally calling it off and I’m going to turn myself in.”

The Gang: “FOR REAL?”
        To be fair, if the change of heart didn’t work, he does seem to be the kind of guy to go back on his word, in which case they’re fucked
        I mean do you even remember how his shadow acted after getting beat?

Kaneshiro was easily the worst person post-palace.
    After Okumura: "Ok guys I understand why you guys were so worried now."
        Tbf the change of heart actually worked, but then SOMEBODY decided to go and fuck it up
            Spoiler alert: F*ck A*****, he is a traitor but Atlus made him look good in the end
                Akechi got Yabadabadood
    After Futaba: “Ok seriously we already know it fucking worked can we PLEASE move on”

After Okumura: “...well, shit.”
    I mean to be fair they did bring up the possibility that even if they changed Kaneshiro’s heart, his thugs may have been able to operate without him and make good on the blackmail.
    After alibaba: Did we murder futaba???
I guarantee they started to message joker like "Did we beat the evil God?"
    Based on Royal I can confidently say ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
        you dropped an arm
            I didn’t need that anyways. I’ll just rayman this bitch
    Depends on how Scramble ends I guess
Seriously guys we've done this like 4 times nothing will go wrong. Okumara will have a change of heart and everything will go swimmingly.
    When they ask themselves if they changed the heart of x character it remembers me when Dora the explorer ask where's is swiper
        It's not so simple... He can teleport by using 「RICARDO」
    :(
Your entire party is poster children for Anxiety from Trauma so it's not really a surprise that they spiral over wondering if it worked out every time despite active knowledge that it has before and probably will.
    That description of the Phantom Thieves killed me because it’s so accurate
    Phantom Thieves are just group therapy lmao
To be fair, the one time everyone (other than haru) didnt worry about it, okumura died on live tv.
    That’s fair
To be fair, the *one* time they assume it’ll work it goes...very poorly for them.
    Yeah, but it's not really their fault. They did what they always do and it would have worked perfectly, if he didn't have info.
        But I feel you’re missing the whole point of that scene. It shows the Phantom Thieves coming crashing down to reality from their highest point, and doubting for the first time since their inception the very methods they use. There’s always been some moral ambiguity in forcibly changing someone’s cognition, but when someone actually dies seemingly as a result of their actions it’s pretty clear their confidence in their methods falters.

Mind you, the game almost immediately reassures them by making it clear there’s someone else involved. But, in the span of time between the death and the point where another actor is revealed to the team, the characters are pretty messed up by the implication that they might have killed someone, and that there might be a random chance of killing the target even if they do everything right.
    Eh, no one important has their parents murdered
Then >!Okumura happens. And they're all very confident during that one. So confident that it was CLEAR AS DAY that something wrong was about to happen. But nope, let's stick with:"YES THIS IS OUR FIFTH TIME AS THIEVES WE'RE GONNA DO IT NO SWEAT THIS TIME"!<
    YO FR THO
Also everyone freaking out that you haven’t sent the calling card yet, despite finishing the palace day one.
tbh even if I supposedly knew it would work I'd probably still be stressed about potential imprisonment
    I mean, is it technically illegal to use... idk magical parallel Dimensions to enter and manipulate the subconscious of people to make them admit wrongdoings?

Like what do you charge someone with?
        They charge you with *quietly executed without trial for national security purposes*
            Ah, the Russian special
        Madarame could have had them for trespassing but that’s all I can really think of.
            thats what ended up sending joker to juvey in the end.
        Can’t speak for Japanese law, but in America you do have the right to a fair trial, and to not incriminate yourself. Not to mention these kids are taking the law and justice into their own hands, which is morally ambiguous at best. 

In short, probably whatever you charge vigilantes with.
            It’s explicitly mentioned around the start of the casino that they’re planning on pulling charges out of their ass and pinning them on whoever they get their hands on. They probably put murder charges (possibly poison-related) considering Okumura. Assault, intimidation, and stalking-related charges are very likely. Hacking is a given considering the Medjed incident, and trespassing, theft, and contraband-related charges would also be easily believable depending on how much they dig. 

In the Japanese criminal justice system, there’s an approximate 98% conviction rate since they generally only take surefire or high-profile cases to trial because of the obsession with prosecution success records, but they also have very lax interrogation rules and rely on signed confessions (Joker signing his name at the start) that they get through any means necessary. Not to mention you don’t have true jury trials in Japan so it’s up to a judge who can very easily just stamp it or be bribed in this universe and move on when they have the whole of national law enforcement banking on it. 

Japan does have capital punishment for some convicted murderers, though only the third years might be old enough for it. Even then it’s extremely rare until you reach the Japanese age of majority (20). However, this is the same system in-universe that wouldn’t blink about bullshit charges so it is entirely reasonable to assume the oldest team members would be executed if they were found or all of them would be subject to extrajudicial justice. The team is very right to be afraid, particularly when this is common knowledge and at least one or two team members (some of the ones eligible for capital punishment in fact) have firsthand knowledge of how they operate. 

TL;DR: They are making it up to whatever is half-believable and the system is in the exact right place to let it happen so they’re right to be this anxious.
                Don't we even see after Joker gets arrested that he gets a whole bunch of crimes of varying accuracy tacked onto him to justify the arrest of the leader of the Phantom Thieves?
        Stealing hearts, duh.
Every single goddamn night and they act like it’s their first palace.
I always wondered why the game was over when you died (logically, not just game mechanics) and this sums it up. They are all true idiots without Joker 😂
    "Igor" has been pretty crucial.
Do you think we did the right thing? These people on the internet said we’re wrong. Are they right?
Laughs in Okumura
    Legit was thinking those same exact words
        In that one everyone was like”Pff don’t worry Haru everything will be fine like always”
Everyday you will receive boatload of messages that say nothing new and you have to reply, even wait for train in the morning you will be asked too.
Reminds me when someone posted here about trying to decide whether to continue having Futaba threaten you until the last day or leaving her in a 20 day coma
    20 day coma ftw.
        I’ll extend that 20 days to 20 fucking years for free
By Futabas POV, she sees this work twice: Shido and the last palace. Two "ties" (herself and Sae), but in her very first ride, it goes HORRIBLY wrong. Like, a-friend-that-rented-disneyland-for-us-sees-her-dad-die-horribly-and-it-might-be-my-fault horrible.
    Go to Disneyland to see your father who played a lot of Kingdom Hearts getting stabbed by Donald Duck who refused to heal during his playthroughs.
We just have to wait and see.
This was actually one of my biggest pet peeves in P5 and Royal, after kamoshida they should know for a fact that it worked because it's a tried and true method and yet they always panic about it
    Especially the Kaneshiro one, he literally turns himself into the police the day after COH and they’re still worried about being blackmailed
        I think they were more worried about his goons rather than Kaneshiro.
    I think expecting it after Kamoshida is a bit much (could've been a happy accident), but after Madarame yeah they should've recognized "yeah this works"
I would do the palaces right at the start and they would go on for a month wondering if the heart change had worked
    [deleted]
        Ahh damn I guess Futaba is still passed out lol Makoto still need a pretend boyfriend orr
        I just did that part, and did the palace in the shortest amount of time, albeit one day for Mementos grinding. She slept for 24 days straight.
            And the whole time Sojiro is just like "that's how she is sometimes, whachagonna do?". like damn bitch, take your daughter to the hospital after the 2nd or 3rd day, at the \_most\_
                Day 14: no signs of activity. Sojiro insists that she's fine. I'm beginning to suspect that he may be responsible somehow.
Well they are working with something that could potentially kill someone.
It could be like the 4th palace you never know
Option a) "We need to hurry and change their heart, but we gotta be careful"
Option b) "I sure hope it all goes just like it did the past times"
Option c) this option is just a figment of your imagination, it don't exist
"How can you be so calm, Joker?!"
    “Because I have a demon lord persona, maxed out my wallet, maxed out my stats, and what not”
        "But... Kaneshiro has a picture of us that can easily be explained to the police and would actually do nothing more than incriminate him to law enforcement for drug possession and contributing to the delinquency of minors... Wait... Why are we worried...?"
            Now that you pointed it out, using the photo makes no sense unless he has cops on his payroll like a certain guy or he just was hoping the kids were stupid enough to fall for it
                But he does though. He is part of the Conspiracy.
                    The Phantom Thieves had no way of knowing that at that point, though
                        True but Ohya did mention that Kaneshiro had some connections..that’s enough reason to be wary.
on my first time playing (and definitely because of the texts the rest of the members send up until the deadline), I definitely thought that like one of these palaces was going to trip me up and require the team to go in to defeat a second palace ruler or something like that
>!and then Okumura happens!<
    Man, imagine the shock you would get if they DIDN'T show what/how it happened.
        I kinda wish they didn’t show him being shot tbh. I prefer twists to dramatic irony.
            It would make for a more shocking moment but they were more concerned with clarity and baiting you with the other Persona user the game had been teasing since Madarame. I think your version makes for a better Okumura confession scene but the game version makes for a better story overall.
            Yeah then at least then we might wonder if it was the Phantom Thieves fault and they screwed up but nah we get spoilt and spend the rest of the arc thinking 'no, you're obviously innocent you dummies'
        Would’ve been so much better, they could’ve also just hinted at him getting shot as opposed to just showing it (like after leaving Okumura, we can see him looking at black mask walking towards him then ending the scene)
I saw this before I beat Kamoshida but now I understand
[removed]
    Spoilers, u could mark it?
        Wow he still didnt mark it
            still hasn't
                Not marked yet
                    damn he still hasn’t done it
                        Even now he hasn't done it
                            how has he not done it yet
                                Ima be honest I dont think hes gonna do it
                                    You might be right
    Report as missing spoiler
To be fair it’s not like they have it down to an exact science. Between Morgana’s amnesia and Shido quashing all Metaverse research other than what would be useful to him, the team has been operating on guesswork and luck- especially vs Kamoshida and Madarame.
    If I was 15 I would be nervous enough to chatter a bit and text my friends before bed. It’s normal behavior. I think it would be tight for Japanese media to branch out of high school.
        I read somewhere that the reason why high school is so prevalent was because in the Japanese public consciousness it’s really the last “safe haven” they have, so to speak, before they are thrust into higher education and the job market. I mean it’s much the same outside Japan but I think that’s why we see high school settings so often.
Also Joker: I'm worried..
This simply shows up nobody in the party - no even Morgana - really knows what they're doing.
    At least Joker never really wonders, he just says to wait it out
        I’m sick of being the only (well aside from Makoto, sometimes) voice of reason in the team. 

HoW aRe YoU sO CaLm RiGht NoW
I had the kaneshiro palace done by the second day but that ment I had 16 days of waiting.
    I'm on my first playthrough now. Beat the fourth Palace with 21 days to go and she just fucking sleeps till then lol.
    H O W ?
        I just kinda... kept going.
I switched out party members when I got to the vaults and I also used a bunch of sp restoring items.
Then on the second day I did the boss fight.
            In P5 Royal as soon as you get 50,000 yen and do the death confidant you can basically get through any palace in a day with lots of SP to spare with the SP accessory. Just switch the SP accessory between the party members. Also, buying the little 5 SP cans of soda every week in the school, bathhouse, and one other place I can’t remember nets 40 SP a week.
                You guys didn’t do every palace in one day in original p5?
                    I could do it but it was much easier with the SP accessories. I’ll get through a palace only using maybe a forth of the SP on 4 characters, compared to really pushing it back when I was on my first playthrough although I wasn’t great at the game back then
        Didn’t mention difficulty lol
Template please
    Spongbob
        No, this is patrick
*laughs in japanese wendys*
Didn’t mona say at the beginning of the game that stealing someone’s treasure has the potential to kill them
    He did, but after changing the fifth heart, you think they'd just be like "Yep, business as usual." Especially since the topic isn't ever "Oh shit, what if we killed them????" and more "~~ARE WE THERE~~ HAS IT CHANGED YET?"
        Fifth heart is >!Okumura!< though.
            ...fourth.

We'll say I said fourth.
                It would still cause a lot of worry though for teenagers who are all shown to have certain “issues”
First time I played P5 I took my time until my friend told me it's best to beat them in one day to maximize social links. 

Now in P5R I literally beat everything within a day, struggle to max my social stats and links while my friends are asking me if we change their hearts or not
    Sure it's advertised as thieves raiding a palace, but the real game is them stats and social links.
        Seriously. Maxing your social stats is the hardest part especially in the first playthrough. Do I hang out with Sojiro or try to my luck at the burger challenge?

Between the original P5 and P5R I wasn't sure if it was worth spending money for but man they dumped so much content in the game its basically a new game in itself.
            There's a bit of neat stuff in royal that I like added like QoL changes and technical attacks actually being useful, but man I loved Persona 5 so much I would have bought Royal anyway.
                Can you eli5 the tech attack changes? I picked up Royal a few days ago after doing p5 at release and I feel like I’m an idiot for not using technicals more but maybe they’re different now.
                    Technicals knock down the enemy now, they didn't do that in vanilla p5
            I'd say always work on Confidants first. I only ever did Social Stat stuff if there was nobody to hang out with. I managed to 100% the game on my first playthrough of Royal
                That's pretty damn good. First playthrough in P5 I wasn't able to max out Futaba and my Kindness, but second and third I was basically completed everything. I'm at the sixth(?) palace right now with all my social stats maxed except for Knowledge. But most of my confidants are maxed out or nearing there.
                    Oh, my first actual playthrough of regular P5 was a disaster lol. I didn't know much about the game, so I kinda winged it, and I think I only maxed like 4 Confidants. By the time Royal came out I'd already played P5 three times + P3 and P4, so I knew what I was doing.
Wait, how does this MeTaVeRsE thing works? Can you repeat it five times in a row for me please?
    The first 8 hours on replays are really tough tbh.
        I end up fast forwarding every time the exposition cat talks
            I swear I learn a new name for Morgana every day
        I always want to replay the game but then I remember the long tutorial and what not, like yeah it’s rewarding but things make me stop or not even start
            I just got royal and finished the first palace and I feel like the gameplay loop is finally there. It is like a 10 hr tutorial. 

See I never finished, I had about 100 hours in my first save when it released and my ps4 bricked. I still don’t know how it ends so I’m super fucking hyped about royal and am having a great time lol.
                [deleted]
                    Is there a new ending? I can tell that’s sarcastic because Atlus can’t think big brain like that
                        There is a new ending, don't spoil yourself though.
            Yeah I’m now about 12 hrs in (some of that may have been me accidentally afking) but I’m just now having mementos explained again lol. I’m on hard so it was a little more grindy I guess.
    Found Ryuji
        For real???
            wait, ain't that bad?
There are usually good explanations. With Madarame it was only the second job. Kaneshiro was impossible to check in on. Futaba was comatose and they were mainly worried about Medjed. And Shido's conspiracy was still as dangerous as ever whether or not they changed his heart.
The game really just loves to put you on edge if you dont already know the plot
    I just beat the game for the first time two days ago. Yeah I had no idea if something was gunna fuck up hahah my words were “well shit.. does this game have dynamic decision making? Should i wait till a certain day to do this? Fuck.”
When you finish a palace 10 days before the deadline
Every. Goddamn. Day.
>! Except for when it doesn’t !<
    >!Sae Moment!<
Could you guys not worry about change of hearts...for five minutes!
    They did, and then okomura died
        It's not like they had any influence in that, nor did it make any sense; why didn't he die the day of, instead of like three weeks later?
            Plot convenience. 

Idk why does it take until the next foggy day for new persona users to recover from the midnight channel?
            Yeah that's a bit of a flaw. They should have come up with some story reason to send the calling card on the last day like they did for others.
                Okumura goes out of town on business all of a sudden and will be back on the last possible day, so its the only option. Boom done.
                    Yep that would work. They even established his restaurant being in Hawaii, so it wouldn't even seem farfetched that he has to leave the country for a bit.
            in storyline it would've been on the day of.

storyline vs gameplay segregation. 

like how if you do futabas early she sleeps for 3 weeks
            Think of it as the same effect of how the change of heart seem to take effect on the target as the body slowly shuts down.
        Well it’s not a consequence of them not worrying about it
            Well of course, but it is funny that the one time they stopped worrying about it, everything went horribly.
    Well...considering the facts that in their world the Change of Heart isn't a guaranteed thing far as they know (the best they have is Mona and his maybes and Futaba's digging) not to mention that each case would lead to some horribly catastrophic results if it isn't successful its not hard to see why they would be at least a little antsy.
And the cool thing is that the one time they're chill about it and just relax something DID go terribly wrong. You know which palace I'm talking about.
Seriously! It feels like they have 1 brain cell sometimes.
To be fair, each time a new palace happens, a new phantom thief joins, and they have no idea what's going on.  And then there's what happens to daddy Okumura, but let's not talk abou that.
    You would have a point if the one wondering if the hearth changed wasn’t Ryuji 90% of the time
    They were right to worry about Kamoshida and Madarame I think, since they were all relatively knew in both cases. They shouldn't have had to worry much about Kaneshiro. Worrying about Futaba makes since sense that was a different situation. We all know what happened with Okumura. And worrying about Shido makes sense since he destroyed his palace himself.
        No with Kaneshiro, they’d worry about that he would go back on his promise or that his thugs would abandon Kaneshiro to save themselves and go through with the blackmail that they have over their victims as a last ditch effort.
            True. Possible that they wouldn’t have to worry about his heart changing, but there are too many other variables.
            Didn’t he tell Makoto that he got rid of the pictures?
                Did he in the real world? When exactly? But like I mentioned, he has his thugs that for all we know could act on the blackmail in their leader’s stead and just abandon him to save their own hides.

His shadow did say he’d call of the debt but doesn’t mean the real one would.
                    I remember shortly after completing his palace Makoto told the thieves in the group chat that Kaneshiro’s told her in a message that he deleted all of their pictures. But you have a point about his subordinates acting in his stead.
    Any new addition after the mention of black mask would nope me, personally.
That very much sounds like something I'd do tbh
Can you blame them? When you literally have the power to brainwash, I’d be worried too if I might accidentally KILL them
    It’s not brainwashing though. The confessions happen on their own based on the targets conscious to feel the weight of their crimes which was plagued with distorted desires which prevented them from feeling any remorse. 

It’s more exorcism of a bad spirit.
    especially with the black-masked guy going around turning people bonkers
To be fair, every palace introduce a new Phantom Thieves, it's their first job, they will have doubts. Especially after the Okumura's Palace
To be fair. There’s good reason to be concerned.

The change of heart is dependent on the person actions afterwards if it truly took effect. The confessions is all on them, all the Thieves do is remove the distorted desires that prevent the target from having a conscious. It’s not brainwashing.

Plus Morgana mentions the risk of death if not properly taken care off and the targets do enter an ill state after the change of heart is done. 

The consequences of them failing is pretty big and each arc ups the stakes.

Even if the change of heart happens, who is to say that something couldn’t happen as it takes effect before the deadline?

There’s no way of the Thieves knowing. 

We saw what Shido did as the change of heart just happened. 

Like for example Kamoshida could have killed himself like he mentioned on stage and Kaneshiro’s thugs could have abandoned their patriarch and went through with the blackmail themselves as a last ditch effort to gain cash as well as run away to save themselves.
    if i remember correctly, a change of heart is set if you see the Shadow glowing and then disappears. Okumura, Shido (probably a very special case) were the only exceptions and that ended badly for the former as the PThieves had to bounce out of the palace before they could see Okumura's change of heart through. >!At least before Akechi shows up.!<
        Not exactly. The change of heart happens as the Thieves leave the Palace with the treasure as they are removing the distorted desires core. 

The Shadow returning to the host is more then choosing to surrender to assist in the change of heart taking affect as the host accepts the Shadow. 

Having the palace collapse can go both ways but the gang would need to take the treasure otherwise the target would just embrace how much of a scumbag they are.
            okay i think i worded that weirdly aha

i still stand on the 'Shadow going back to the host'  ensuring smooth sailing, though. but you're right about the legitimate concern though. the more 'high status' the target is means more higher risk.
    Black mask being in a palace would creep me the fuck out even before okumura
“Is that part of your master plan?”
There is soooo much unnecessary dialogue in this game that is basically always the same. All those group chats, all those looooong discussions with the villains, that basically play out like "You are a bad person!" vs "HAHAHA, you kids have no idea how the world works!"

First playthrough was 110 hours for me, could have trimmed that down to 50 with a bit less repetitive dialogue.
    That's exactly what I was thinking. Characters over-explain things all the time and after the 3rd palace, it gets really repetitive. Other than that, amazing game.
        Skipping all of the chats and most of the big villain talks was probably my favourite part of NG+ :)
            I didn't skip them because I have OCD and wanted to experience the "full" story.
                wait until you reach your 7th, 8th or 9th playthrough
                    This is in my top 5 and I can’t imagine playing it this much. People do it with Death Stranding too, I guess.
                    It's such a long game? Why would you do that? Where do you have the time to do that?
                        do i need a reason to play a game i like over and over?
                    I would love to reach my 7th-9th playthrough but I don't have the mental preparation to play P5 again. I already am in my 4th playthrough... (I got the game on January 2020. Just for clarification that I don't own it since 2017.)
        That's a thing that happens in most Japanese media. In Yakuza too most characters explain the same concept a few times but not as much as Persona 5, still great games the both of them.
            Oh boy played death stranding. So much repetitive dialouge
                How fucking GOOD THOUGH OMG
            Mhm, I completely agree. However, if you are a psycho and have played the game 3 times (like me), it gets a little cringy at some points.
            It kinda is, but P5 has been the absolute worst in that aspect from any Japanese media I know
    welcome to anime repetition trope.

&#x200B;

"I can kill you with my middle finger"

"Did you say you can kill me with your middle finger?"

"Yes, I can kill you with my middle finger"

&#x200B;

That's happens in 99% of all manga.
    Wait! Useless?
    I mean, it’s a bit of an exaggeration. It’s also not AS troublesome the first run. It’s mainly Morgana explaining things to Ryuji while acknowledging that the MC is smart.
Honestly after like the second time they debated the morality of what they were doing I wanted to physically come into the game and shake them while screaming "We punished a shithole of a person you dumbasses! Of course we did the right thing!"
    Honestly my moral issue is whether you can blame the post-change or heart person for the pre-change of heart person’s actions. Like, by stealing the treasure you’re basically turning them into a good person, right? Is it fair to create a good person who will then be burdened all their life by actions they would never have chosen to do if they existed in that mental state at the time?
        I view it as stealing a mental illness. If you style the psychopathy from a psychopath or the depression from a depressed person, dont you think the person would be happier?
            Oh yeah, I do agree that overall the person is better off without the palace. My issue lands at the point where that person then has to deal with the guilt of everything that was done by what is... effectively sort of an evil alter-ego?
                If I told you that I could steal away something that is incredibly wrong with your mind, physically cut out part of you that was corrupt, with you full in the knowledge that you would be a significantly better person afterwards, with the only side effect being that you would view your past actions in a new light and probably wont like what you see, wouldnt you take that option for the potentially better future?
    Yeah, true, but it's more of a, "Did this person deserve to never have a chance to ever live life again, and never be rehabilitated?"
        The first part, almost universally yes. The only person who I'm hesitant about giving life in prison is Madarame because it was only plagiarism but hes definitely still very bad. Second, you yourselves did the rehabilitation you. Changing someone's heart is like going into their mind and scooping out a mental illness
            madarame also physically and verbally abused his pupils, driving one of them to suicide, and let yusuke's mom die when he could've saved her. the second part could be hard to convict, but he could definitely confess to abuse and aid in a suicide along with the plagiarism.
            Yeah, but they never recover. They forever live in shame
                Are you trying to say a sex offender shouldnt pay for their crimes because that reputation will be with them for the rest of their lives?
                    Not at all. I'm saying they should pay, but they won't ever get a chance to be a better person
                        Of course they will? The very act of turning themselves in made them better people. Redemption is a long hard road but one available to everyone
                            The problem with the change of heart is that the fault was the person's distorted desires. In Persona 5 everyone who does bad things have a place in mémentos or even a palace (except for Phantom Thieves)

If you take their treasure away, you have essentially rehabilited them.

The very reason we put people in prison and punish them is for them to never commit crimes again, you want a society exempt of criminals. That's why in some countries like Norway, prisons are kinda like rehabilitation centers, with psychologists and various activities, they currently have the lowest recidivism rates of all so it works pretty well.

What I'm getting at is that people like Madarame, kaneshiro, kamoshida, etc... are already rehabilited once you take their treasures, they will beg for forgiveness and never commit crimes again.
The only reason to put they behind bars is for vengeance
                                So by your argument, if someone committed a horrendous crime a year ago but has since changed and become a better person, they shouldn't serve any jail time
                                    Yes indeed, but it's impossible to tell if someone has really changed in real life, so they should still serve jail time. Perhaps have a house arrest or a probation. If the crime was minor maybe just a psychiatric test would suffice to assess if they changed for real.

In Persona 5 you are 100% sure the person has changed, things would be different if we knew for certain they'd never commit crimes again. 
The members of the phantom thieves either haven't thought about it much or either they are quite vengeful
                                    Interestingly enough, I've read that "crime of passion" style murderers have some of the lowest recidivism rates of anyone who commits crimes, so maybe?
Lmaooo
This game would really be a stellar game if it offered a more focused gaming experience IMHO:

- less repetitive / meaningless dialogue
- a more cohesive world to explore (too many empty places): you are not rewarded for exploring
- more consistent character reactions (stop being surprised already 😅)

It reminds me of the horrible walls of texts of games like Pillars of Eternity…. But at least in pillars it was about lore and not dragging out long conversations or meaningless text messaging (every time the phone ring in this game i roll my eyes anticipating one more worthless exhange of words between protagonists)
I don’t even read the messages it’s always did the change of heart happen or are we going to the palace when we have 2 in game weeks
I mean, did you beat the game?
That’s because there was a chance (always) that a heart change would result in a suicide or even a mental shutdown itself. Morgana said so in the beginning of the game and >!Shiho’s fall!< was a plot device to let Ryuji take the risk as it showed that Kamoshida deserved punishment even with a chance of death. But since nothing is without flaws our heroes had a thick plot armor that prevented these cases. (I did a little calculation and if the chance of the heart change going successfully is 99%, in 150 heart change cases there should have been 78% chance of at least one failure).
I always just skip
    Persona 5 and repetitive dialogue. Name a more iconic duo.

... I mean
    WELL
        You'll know if you played through the game
The way this game presents everyone makes them look fucking dumb, they always learn everything after the player has figured it out.
    That's usually because the player has way more information than any of the characters.
Considering the group are all remnants of having their initial confidence and place of belonging shattered it stands to reason they're not altogether certain in their ability once the deed has been done. 

And the one time they felt confident in their ability in changing their target's heart... the guy died, admittedly not by their hand but they didn't really certify Okumura having the change of heart either, they simply left him in his crumbling palace.
I mean, Okumura, but…
[deleted]
    there are even some days where I'm like "yeah it's about time to head into the palace" and then everyone's like "Joker lets go to the palace >:(" and now I have to chill with Takemi out of spite
        “Hey lets go to the palace today” 



Well guess I’m banging my teacher today.
        I do the same shit XD
        Even if you are already max with her
Palace or Mementos like please guys chill, let me get more targets.
    Shouldn’t we tell the others about that target in Mementos?
I really need to work on the burger challenge and banging Makoto, so no palace yet
I will always and forever accept the poor traumatized children being anxious to go metaversing when the alternative is hearing your party members go "actually, I'm tired and not going to Tartarus tonight. Good luck nerd." even if that fits the theme of its own game.
Exactly 
I wish I could get him to say that
I even got to a point where I stopped wanting to hang out with my party members before completing a palace because I got tired of their reactions. Worst is Yusuke’s.
I'm be like: Screw you guys, I'm sticking to walkthrough in GameFAQs calendar
have some god damn... FAITH!

There are two options in life: You either get guilt tripped into entering the palace for two weeks, or you deal with your teammates constantly worrying about whether the change of heart worked.
The one time they had confidence that it'd work out, Okumura died, so uh...
    Sounds like my self confidence
    [deleted]
        >!Just as Dr. Maruki planned!<
            That honestly would be my ideal world.

Even if it doesn’t matter in this case.
        Now wait just a minute that’s not OK.
            Please just let me believe this game has no major flaws. Let me have this.
                I would, but Haru joins the party during that part. A great evil leads to you getting best girl.
            wait, ain't that bad?
Well it's not supposed to be a liked feature, it's supposed to simulate all your teenage highschool friends stressing the fuck out and having an internal crisis at the fact that they're risking the lives of themselves and others.

Putting up with that bullshit is what being a leader is.
    [deleted]
        I dunno, stressing out and incessantly texting your friends about it is what high school's all about for a lot of people, no?
            [deleted]
                I mean, you probably weren’t, you know, a world-famous criminal doing metaphysical crime with all your friends.

They have good reason to worry. And, at least for the first few palaces and after Okumura, they really couldn’t say for sure if their weird method would always work properly or not. Some skepticism is a good idea.

So, yeah, I think it was kinda annoying, but not terribly unrealistic or as whiny as you think.

Edit: added second and third paragraphs because I hit post too soon
                The point is that Joker is a non-average teenager who does not tell them to shut the fuck up, which is why he's a good leader.
                    He's got the patience of a saint. You can only say "don't worry about it" so many times.
Kaneshiro: "I deleted the pictures and also don't worry about the money."

The Phantom Thieves: "Do you think it worked?!?"
    Kaneshiro: “I am unilaterally calling it off and I’m going to turn myself in.”

The Gang: “FOR REAL?”
    To be fair, if the change of heart didn’t work, he does seem to be the kind of guy to go back on his word, in which case they’re fucked
    I mean do you even remember how his shadow acted after getting beat?

Kaneshiro was easily the worst person post-palace.
After Okumura: "Ok guys I understand why you guys were so worried now."
    Tbf the change of heart actually worked, but then SOMEBODY decided to go and fuck it up
        Spoiler alert: F*ck A*****, he is a traitor but Atlus made him look good in the end
            Akechi got Yabadabadood
After Futaba: “Ok seriously we already know it fucking worked can we PLEASE move on”

After Okumura: “...well, shit.”
I mean to be fair they did bring up the possibility that even if they changed Kaneshiro’s heart, his thugs may have been able to operate without him and make good on the blackmail.
After alibaba: Did we murder futaba???
Based on Royal I can confidently say ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    you dropped an arm
        I didn’t need that anyways. I’ll just rayman this bitch
Depends on how Scramble ends I guess
When they ask themselves if they changed the heart of x character it remembers me when Dora the explorer ask where's is swiper
    It's not so simple... He can teleport by using 「RICARDO」
:(
That description of the Phantom Thieves killed me because it’s so accurate
Phantom Thieves are just group therapy lmao
That’s fair
Yeah, but it's not really their fault. They did what they always do and it would have worked perfectly, if he didn't have info.
    But I feel you’re missing the whole point of that scene. It shows the Phantom Thieves coming crashing down to reality from their highest point, and doubting for the first time since their inception the very methods they use. There’s always been some moral ambiguity in forcibly changing someone’s cognition, but when someone actually dies seemingly as a result of their actions it’s pretty clear their confidence in their methods falters.

Mind you, the game almost immediately reassures them by making it clear there’s someone else involved. But, in the span of time between the death and the point where another actor is revealed to the team, the characters are pretty messed up by the implication that they might have killed someone, and that there might be a random chance of killing the target even if they do everything right.
Eh, no one important has their parents murdered
YO FR THO
I mean, is it technically illegal to use... idk magical parallel Dimensions to enter and manipulate the subconscious of people to make them admit wrongdoings?

Like what do you charge someone with?
    They charge you with *quietly executed without trial for national security purposes*
        Ah, the Russian special
    Madarame could have had them for trespassing but that’s all I can really think of.
        thats what ended up sending joker to juvey in the end.
    Can’t speak for Japanese law, but in America you do have the right to a fair trial, and to not incriminate yourself. Not to mention these kids are taking the law and justice into their own hands, which is morally ambiguous at best. 

In short, probably whatever you charge vigilantes with.
        It’s explicitly mentioned around the start of the casino that they’re planning on pulling charges out of their ass and pinning them on whoever they get their hands on. They probably put murder charges (possibly poison-related) considering Okumura. Assault, intimidation, and stalking-related charges are very likely. Hacking is a given considering the Medjed incident, and trespassing, theft, and contraband-related charges would also be easily believable depending on how much they dig. 

In the Japanese criminal justice system, there’s an approximate 98% conviction rate since they generally only take surefire or high-profile cases to trial because of the obsession with prosecution success records, but they also have very lax interrogation rules and rely on signed confessions (Joker signing his name at the start) that they get through any means necessary. Not to mention you don’t have true jury trials in Japan so it’s up to a judge who can very easily just stamp it or be bribed in this universe and move on when they have the whole of national law enforcement banking on it. 

Japan does have capital punishment for some convicted murderers, though only the third years might be old enough for it. Even then it’s extremely rare until you reach the Japanese age of majority (20). However, this is the same system in-universe that wouldn’t blink about bullshit charges so it is entirely reasonable to assume the oldest team members would be executed if they were found or all of them would be subject to extrajudicial justice. The team is very right to be afraid, particularly when this is common knowledge and at least one or two team members (some of the ones eligible for capital punishment in fact) have firsthand knowledge of how they operate. 

TL;DR: They are making it up to whatever is half-believable and the system is in the exact right place to let it happen so they’re right to be this anxious.
            Don't we even see after Joker gets arrested that he gets a whole bunch of crimes of varying accuracy tacked onto him to justify the arrest of the leader of the Phantom Thieves?
    Stealing hearts, duh.
"Igor" has been pretty crucial.
Legit was thinking those same exact words
    In that one everyone was like”Pff don’t worry Haru everything will be fine like always”
20 day coma ftw.
    I’ll extend that 20 days to 20 fucking years for free
Go to Disneyland to see your father who played a lot of Kingdom Hearts getting stabbed by Donald Duck who refused to heal during his playthroughs.
Especially the Kaneshiro one, he literally turns himself into the police the day after COH and they’re still worried about being blackmailed
    I think they were more worried about his goons rather than Kaneshiro.
I think expecting it after Kamoshida is a bit much (could've been a happy accident), but after Madarame yeah they should've recognized "yeah this works"
[deleted]
    Ahh damn I guess Futaba is still passed out lol Makoto still need a pretend boyfriend orr
    I just did that part, and did the palace in the shortest amount of time, albeit one day for Mementos grinding. She slept for 24 days straight.
        And the whole time Sojiro is just like "that's how she is sometimes, whachagonna do?". like damn bitch, take your daughter to the hospital after the 2nd or 3rd day, at the \_most\_
            Day 14: no signs of activity. Sojiro insists that she's fine. I'm beginning to suspect that he may be responsible somehow.
“Because I have a demon lord persona, maxed out my wallet, maxed out my stats, and what not”
    "But... Kaneshiro has a picture of us that can easily be explained to the police and would actually do nothing more than incriminate him to law enforcement for drug possession and contributing to the delinquency of minors... Wait... Why are we worried...?"
        Now that you pointed it out, using the photo makes no sense unless he has cops on his payroll like a certain guy or he just was hoping the kids were stupid enough to fall for it
            But he does though. He is part of the Conspiracy.
                The Phantom Thieves had no way of knowing that at that point, though
                    True but Ohya did mention that Kaneshiro had some connections..that’s enough reason to be wary.
Man, imagine the shock you would get if they DIDN'T show what/how it happened.
    I kinda wish they didn’t show him being shot tbh. I prefer twists to dramatic irony.
        It would make for a more shocking moment but they were more concerned with clarity and baiting you with the other Persona user the game had been teasing since Madarame. I think your version makes for a better Okumura confession scene but the game version makes for a better story overall.
        Yeah then at least then we might wonder if it was the Phantom Thieves fault and they screwed up but nah we get spoilt and spend the rest of the arc thinking 'no, you're obviously innocent you dummies'
    Would’ve been so much better, they could’ve also just hinted at him getting shot as opposed to just showing it (like after leaving Okumura, we can see him looking at black mask walking towards him then ending the scene)
Spoilers, u could mark it?
    Wow he still didnt mark it
        still hasn't
            Not marked yet
                damn he still hasn’t done it
                    Even now he hasn't done it
                        how has he not done it yet
                            Ima be honest I dont think hes gonna do it
                                You might be right
Report as missing spoiler
If I was 15 I would be nervous enough to chatter a bit and text my friends before bed. It’s normal behavior. I think it would be tight for Japanese media to branch out of high school.
    I read somewhere that the reason why high school is so prevalent was because in the Japanese public consciousness it’s really the last “safe haven” they have, so to speak, before they are thrust into higher education and the job market. I mean it’s much the same outside Japan but I think that’s why we see high school settings so often.
At least Joker never really wonders, he just says to wait it out
    I’m sick of being the only (well aside from Makoto, sometimes) voice of reason in the team. 

HoW aRe YoU sO CaLm RiGht NoW
I'm on my first playthrough now. Beat the fourth Palace with 21 days to go and she just fucking sleeps till then lol.
H O W ?
    I just kinda... kept going.
I switched out party members when I got to the vaults and I also used a bunch of sp restoring items.
Then on the second day I did the boss fight.
        In P5 Royal as soon as you get 50,000 yen and do the death confidant you can basically get through any palace in a day with lots of SP to spare with the SP accessory. Just switch the SP accessory between the party members. Also, buying the little 5 SP cans of soda every week in the school, bathhouse, and one other place I can’t remember nets 40 SP a week.
            You guys didn’t do every palace in one day in original p5?
                I could do it but it was much easier with the SP accessories. I’ll get through a palace only using maybe a forth of the SP on 4 characters, compared to really pushing it back when I was on my first playthrough although I wasn’t great at the game back then
    Didn’t mention difficulty lol
Spongbob
    No, this is patrick
He did, but after changing the fifth heart, you think they'd just be like "Yep, business as usual." Especially since the topic isn't ever "Oh shit, what if we killed them????" and more "~~ARE WE THERE~~ HAS IT CHANGED YET?"
    Fifth heart is >!Okumura!< though.
        ...fourth.

We'll say I said fourth.
            It would still cause a lot of worry though for teenagers who are all shown to have certain “issues”
Sure it's advertised as thieves raiding a palace, but the real game is them stats and social links.
    Seriously. Maxing your social stats is the hardest part especially in the first playthrough. Do I hang out with Sojiro or try to my luck at the burger challenge?

Between the original P5 and P5R I wasn't sure if it was worth spending money for but man they dumped so much content in the game its basically a new game in itself.
        There's a bit of neat stuff in royal that I like added like QoL changes and technical attacks actually being useful, but man I loved Persona 5 so much I would have bought Royal anyway.
            Can you eli5 the tech attack changes? I picked up Royal a few days ago after doing p5 at release and I feel like I’m an idiot for not using technicals more but maybe they’re different now.
                Technicals knock down the enemy now, they didn't do that in vanilla p5
        I'd say always work on Confidants first. I only ever did Social Stat stuff if there was nobody to hang out with. I managed to 100% the game on my first playthrough of Royal
            That's pretty damn good. First playthrough in P5 I wasn't able to max out Futaba and my Kindness, but second and third I was basically completed everything. I'm at the sixth(?) palace right now with all my social stats maxed except for Knowledge. But most of my confidants are maxed out or nearing there.
                Oh, my first actual playthrough of regular P5 was a disaster lol. I didn't know much about the game, so I kinda winged it, and I think I only maxed like 4 Confidants. By the time Royal came out I'd already played P5 three times + P3 and P4, so I knew what I was doing.
The first 8 hours on replays are really tough tbh.
    I end up fast forwarding every time the exposition cat talks
        I swear I learn a new name for Morgana every day
    I always want to replay the game but then I remember the long tutorial and what not, like yeah it’s rewarding but things make me stop or not even start
        I just got royal and finished the first palace and I feel like the gameplay loop is finally there. It is like a 10 hr tutorial. 

See I never finished, I had about 100 hours in my first save when it released and my ps4 bricked. I still don’t know how it ends so I’m super fucking hyped about royal and am having a great time lol.

                Is there a new ending? I can tell that’s sarcastic because Atlus can’t think big brain like that
                    There is a new ending, don't spoil yourself though.
        Yeah I’m now about 12 hrs in (some of that may have been me accidentally afking) but I’m just now having mementos explained again lol. I’m on hard so it was a little more grindy I guess.
Found Ryuji
    For real???
        wait, ain't that bad?
I just beat the game for the first time two days ago. Yeah I had no idea if something was gunna fuck up hahah my words were “well shit.. does this game have dynamic decision making? Should i wait till a certain day to do this? Fuck.”
>!Sae Moment!<
They did, and then okomura died
    It's not like they had any influence in that, nor did it make any sense; why didn't he die the day of, instead of like three weeks later?
        Plot convenience. 

Idk why does it take until the next foggy day for new persona users to recover from the midnight channel?
        Yeah that's a bit of a flaw. They should have come up with some story reason to send the calling card on the last day like they did for others.
            Okumura goes out of town on business all of a sudden and will be back on the last possible day, so its the only option. Boom done.
                Yep that would work. They even established his restaurant being in Hawaii, so it wouldn't even seem farfetched that he has to leave the country for a bit.
        in storyline it would've been on the day of.

storyline vs gameplay segregation. 

like how if you do futabas early she sleeps for 3 weeks
        Think of it as the same effect of how the change of heart seem to take effect on the target as the body slowly shuts down.
    Well it’s not a consequence of them not worrying about it
        Well of course, but it is funny that the one time they stopped worrying about it, everything went horribly.
Well...considering the facts that in their world the Change of Heart isn't a guaranteed thing far as they know (the best they have is Mona and his maybes and Futaba's digging) not to mention that each case would lead to some horribly catastrophic results if it isn't successful its not hard to see why they would be at least a little antsy.
You would have a point if the one wondering if the hearth changed wasn’t Ryuji 90% of the time
They were right to worry about Kamoshida and Madarame I think, since they were all relatively knew in both cases. They shouldn't have had to worry much about Kaneshiro. Worrying about Futaba makes since sense that was a different situation. We all know what happened with Okumura. And worrying about Shido makes sense since he destroyed his palace himself.
    No with Kaneshiro, they’d worry about that he would go back on his promise or that his thugs would abandon Kaneshiro to save themselves and go through with the blackmail that they have over their victims as a last ditch effort.
        True. Possible that they wouldn’t have to worry about his heart changing, but there are too many other variables.
        Didn’t he tell Makoto that he got rid of the pictures?
            Did he in the real world? When exactly? But like I mentioned, he has his thugs that for all we know could act on the blackmail in their leader’s stead and just abandon him to save their own hides.

His shadow did say he’d call of the debt but doesn’t mean the real one would.
                I remember shortly after completing his palace Makoto told the thieves in the group chat that Kaneshiro’s told her in a message that he deleted all of their pictures. But you have a point about his subordinates acting in his stead.
Any new addition after the mention of black mask would nope me, personally.
It’s not brainwashing though. The confessions happen on their own based on the targets conscious to feel the weight of their crimes which was plagued with distorted desires which prevented them from feeling any remorse. 

It’s more exorcism of a bad spirit.
especially with the black-masked guy going around turning people bonkers
if i remember correctly, a change of heart is set if you see the Shadow glowing and then disappears. Okumura, Shido (probably a very special case) were the only exceptions and that ended badly for the former as the PThieves had to bounce out of the palace before they could see Okumura's change of heart through. >!At least before Akechi shows up.!<
    Not exactly. The change of heart happens as the Thieves leave the Palace with the treasure as they are removing the distorted desires core. 

The Shadow returning to the host is more then choosing to surrender to assist in the change of heart taking affect as the host accepts the Shadow. 

Having the palace collapse can go both ways but the gang would need to take the treasure otherwise the target would just embrace how much of a scumbag they are.
        okay i think i worded that weirdly aha

i still stand on the 'Shadow going back to the host'  ensuring smooth sailing, though. but you're right about the legitimate concern though. the more 'high status' the target is means more higher risk.
Black mask being in a palace would creep me the fuck out even before okumura
That's exactly what I was thinking. Characters over-explain things all the time and after the 3rd palace, it gets really repetitive. Other than that, amazing game.
    Skipping all of the chats and most of the big villain talks was probably my favourite part of NG+ :)
        I didn't skip them because I have OCD and wanted to experience the "full" story.
            wait until you reach your 7th, 8th or 9th playthrough
                This is in my top 5 and I can’t imagine playing it this much. People do it with Death Stranding too, I guess.
                It's such a long game? Why would you do that? Where do you have the time to do that?
                    do i need a reason to play a game i like over and over?
                I would love to reach my 7th-9th playthrough but I don't have the mental preparation to play P5 again. I already am in my 4th playthrough... (I got the game on January 2020. Just for clarification that I don't own it since 2017.)
    That's a thing that happens in most Japanese media. In Yakuza too most characters explain the same concept a few times but not as much as Persona 5, still great games the both of them.
        Oh boy played death stranding. So much repetitive dialouge
            How fucking GOOD THOUGH OMG
        Mhm, I completely agree. However, if you are a psycho and have played the game 3 times (like me), it gets a little cringy at some points.
        It kinda is, but P5 has been the absolute worst in that aspect from any Japanese media I know
welcome to anime repetition trope.

&#x200B;

"I can kill you with my middle finger"

"Did you say you can kill me with your middle finger?"

"Yes, I can kill you with my middle finger"

&#x200B;

That's happens in 99% of all manga.
Wait! Useless?
I mean, it’s a bit of an exaggeration. It’s also not AS troublesome the first run. It’s mainly Morgana explaining things to Ryuji while acknowledging that the MC is smart.
Honestly my moral issue is whether you can blame the post-change or heart person for the pre-change of heart person’s actions. Like, by stealing the treasure you’re basically turning them into a good person, right? Is it fair to create a good person who will then be burdened all their life by actions they would never have chosen to do if they existed in that mental state at the time?
    I view it as stealing a mental illness. If you style the psychopathy from a psychopath or the depression from a depressed person, dont you think the person would be happier?
        Oh yeah, I do agree that overall the person is better off without the palace. My issue lands at the point where that person then has to deal with the guilt of everything that was done by what is... effectively sort of an evil alter-ego?
            If I told you that I could steal away something that is incredibly wrong with your mind, physically cut out part of you that was corrupt, with you full in the knowledge that you would be a significantly better person afterwards, with the only side effect being that you would view your past actions in a new light and probably wont like what you see, wouldnt you take that option for the potentially better future?
Yeah, true, but it's more of a, "Did this person deserve to never have a chance to ever live life again, and never be rehabilitated?"
    The first part, almost universally yes. The only person who I'm hesitant about giving life in prison is Madarame because it was only plagiarism but hes definitely still very bad. Second, you yourselves did the rehabilitation you. Changing someone's heart is like going into their mind and scooping out a mental illness
        madarame also physically and verbally abused his pupils, driving one of them to suicide, and let yusuke's mom die when he could've saved her. the second part could be hard to convict, but he could definitely confess to abuse and aid in a suicide along with the plagiarism.
        Yeah, but they never recover. They forever live in shame
            Are you trying to say a sex offender shouldnt pay for their crimes because that reputation will be with them for the rest of their lives?
                Not at all. I'm saying they should pay, but they won't ever get a chance to be a better person
                    Of course they will? The very act of turning themselves in made them better people. Redemption is a long hard road but one available to everyone
                        The problem with the change of heart is that the fault was the person's distorted desires. In Persona 5 everyone who does bad things have a place in mémentos or even a palace (except for Phantom Thieves)

If you take their treasure away, you have essentially rehabilited them.

The very reason we put people in prison and punish them is for them to never commit crimes again, you want a society exempt of criminals. That's why in some countries like Norway, prisons are kinda like rehabilitation centers, with psychologists and various activities, they currently have the lowest recidivism rates of all so it works pretty well.

What I'm getting at is that people like Madarame, kaneshiro, kamoshida, etc... are already rehabilited once you take their treasures, they will beg for forgiveness and never commit crimes again.
The only reason to put they behind bars is for vengeance
                            So by your argument, if someone committed a horrendous crime a year ago but has since changed and become a better person, they shouldn't serve any jail time
                                Yes indeed, but it's impossible to tell if someone has really changed in real life, so they should still serve jail time. Perhaps have a house arrest or a probation. If the crime was minor maybe just a psychiatric test would suffice to assess if they changed for real.

In Persona 5 you are 100% sure the person has changed, things would be different if we knew for certain they'd never commit crimes again. 
The members of the phantom thieves either haven't thought about it much or either they are quite vengeful
                                Interestingly enough, I've read that "crime of passion" style murderers have some of the lowest recidivism rates of anyone who commits crimes, so maybe?

WELL
    You'll know if you played through the game
That's usually because the player has way more information than any of the characters.
there are even some days where I'm like "yeah it's about time to head into the palace" and then everyone's like "Joker lets go to the palace >:(" and now I have to chill with Takemi out of spite
    “Hey lets go to the palace today” 



Well guess I’m banging my teacher today.
    I do the same shit XD
    Even if you are already max with her
Shouldn’t we tell the others about that target in Mementos?

Even if it doesn’t matter in this case.
    Now wait just a minute that’s not OK.
        Please just let me believe this game has no major flaws. Let me have this.
            I would, but Haru joins the party during that part. A great evil leads to you getting best girl.
        wait, ain't that bad?
[deleted]
    I dunno, stressing out and incessantly texting your friends about it is what high school's all about for a lot of people, no?
        [deleted]
            I mean, you probably weren’t, you know, a world-famous criminal doing metaphysical crime with all your friends.

They have good reason to worry. And, at least for the first few palaces and after Okumura, they really couldn’t say for sure if their weird method would always work properly or not. Some skepticism is a good idea.

So, yeah, I think it was kinda annoying, but not terribly unrealistic or as whiny as you think.

Edit: added second and third paragraphs because I hit post too soon
            The point is that Joker is a non-average teenager who does not tell them to shut the fuck up, which is why he's a good leader.
                He's got the patience of a saint. You can only say "don't worry about it" so many times.
Kaneshiro: “I am unilaterally calling it off and I’m going to turn myself in.”

The Gang: “FOR REAL?”
To be fair, if the change of heart didn’t work, he does seem to be the kind of guy to go back on his word, in which case they’re fucked
I mean do you even remember how his shadow acted after getting beat?

Kaneshiro was easily the worst person post-palace.
Tbf the change of heart actually worked, but then SOMEBODY decided to go and fuck it up
    Spoiler alert: F*ck A*****, he is a traitor but Atlus made him look good in the end
        Akechi got Yabadabadood
you dropped an arm
    I didn’t need that anyways. I’ll just rayman this bitch
It's not so simple... He can teleport by using 「RICARDO」
But I feel you’re missing the whole point of that scene. It shows the Phantom Thieves coming crashing down to reality from their highest point, and doubting for the first time since their inception the very methods they use. There’s always been some moral ambiguity in forcibly changing someone’s cognition, but when someone actually dies seemingly as a result of their actions it’s pretty clear their confidence in their methods falters.

Mind you, the game almost immediately reassures them by making it clear there’s someone else involved. But, in the span of time between the death and the point where another actor is revealed to the team, the characters are pretty messed up by the implication that they might have killed someone, and that there might be a random chance of killing the target even if they do everything right.
They charge you with *quietly executed without trial for national security purposes*
    Ah, the Russian special
Madarame could have had them for trespassing but that’s all I can really think of.
    thats what ended up sending joker to juvey in the end.
Can’t speak for Japanese law, but in America you do have the right to a fair trial, and to not incriminate yourself. Not to mention these kids are taking the law and justice into their own hands, which is morally ambiguous at best. 

In short, probably whatever you charge vigilantes with.
    It’s explicitly mentioned around the start of the casino that they’re planning on pulling charges out of their ass and pinning them on whoever they get their hands on. They probably put murder charges (possibly poison-related) considering Okumura. Assault, intimidation, and stalking-related charges are very likely. Hacking is a given considering the Medjed incident, and trespassing, theft, and contraband-related charges would also be easily believable depending on how much they dig. 

In the Japanese criminal justice system, there’s an approximate 98% conviction rate since they generally only take surefire or high-profile cases to trial because of the obsession with prosecution success records, but they also have very lax interrogation rules and rely on signed confessions (Joker signing his name at the start) that they get through any means necessary. Not to mention you don’t have true jury trials in Japan so it’s up to a judge who can very easily just stamp it or be bribed in this universe and move on when they have the whole of national law enforcement banking on it. 

Japan does have capital punishment for some convicted murderers, though only the third years might be old enough for it. Even then it’s extremely rare until you reach the Japanese age of majority (20). However, this is the same system in-universe that wouldn’t blink about bullshit charges so it is entirely reasonable to assume the oldest team members would be executed if they were found or all of them would be subject to extrajudicial justice. The team is very right to be afraid, particularly when this is common knowledge and at least one or two team members (some of the ones eligible for capital punishment in fact) have firsthand knowledge of how they operate. 

TL;DR: They are making it up to whatever is half-believable and the system is in the exact right place to let it happen so they’re right to be this anxious.
        Don't we even see after Joker gets arrested that he gets a whole bunch of crimes of varying accuracy tacked onto him to justify the arrest of the leader of the Phantom Thieves?
Stealing hearts, duh.
In that one everyone was like”Pff don’t worry Haru everything will be fine like always”
I’ll extend that 20 days to 20 fucking years for free
I think they were more worried about his goons rather than Kaneshiro.
Ahh damn I guess Futaba is still passed out lol Makoto still need a pretend boyfriend orr
I just did that part, and did the palace in the shortest amount of time, albeit one day for Mementos grinding. She slept for 24 days straight.
    And the whole time Sojiro is just like "that's how she is sometimes, whachagonna do?". like damn bitch, take your daughter to the hospital after the 2nd or 3rd day, at the \_most\_
        Day 14: no signs of activity. Sojiro insists that she's fine. I'm beginning to suspect that he may be responsible somehow.
"But... Kaneshiro has a picture of us that can easily be explained to the police and would actually do nothing more than incriminate him to law enforcement for drug possession and contributing to the delinquency of minors... Wait... Why are we worried...?"
    Now that you pointed it out, using the photo makes no sense unless he has cops on his payroll like a certain guy or he just was hoping the kids were stupid enough to fall for it
        But he does though. He is part of the Conspiracy.
            The Phantom Thieves had no way of knowing that at that point, though
                True but Ohya did mention that Kaneshiro had some connections..that’s enough reason to be wary.
I kinda wish they didn’t show him being shot tbh. I prefer twists to dramatic irony.
    It would make for a more shocking moment but they were more concerned with clarity and baiting you with the other Persona user the game had been teasing since Madarame. I think your version makes for a better Okumura confession scene but the game version makes for a better story overall.
    Yeah then at least then we might wonder if it was the Phantom Thieves fault and they screwed up but nah we get spoilt and spend the rest of the arc thinking 'no, you're obviously innocent you dummies'
Would’ve been so much better, they could’ve also just hinted at him getting shot as opposed to just showing it (like after leaving Okumura, we can see him looking at black mask walking towards him then ending the scene)
Wow he still didnt mark it
    still hasn't
        Not marked yet
            damn he still hasn’t done it
                Even now he hasn't done it
                    how has he not done it yet
                        Ima be honest I dont think hes gonna do it
                            You might be right
I read somewhere that the reason why high school is so prevalent was because in the Japanese public consciousness it’s really the last “safe haven” they have, so to speak, before they are thrust into higher education and the job market. I mean it’s much the same outside Japan but I think that’s why we see high school settings so often.
I’m sick of being the only (well aside from Makoto, sometimes) voice of reason in the team. 

HoW aRe YoU sO CaLm RiGht NoW
I just kinda... kept going.
I switched out party members when I got to the vaults and I also used a bunch of sp restoring items.
Then on the second day I did the boss fight.
    In P5 Royal as soon as you get 50,000 yen and do the death confidant you can basically get through any palace in a day with lots of SP to spare with the SP accessory. Just switch the SP accessory between the party members. Also, buying the little 5 SP cans of soda every week in the school, bathhouse, and one other place I can’t remember nets 40 SP a week.
        You guys didn’t do every palace in one day in original p5?
            I could do it but it was much easier with the SP accessories. I’ll get through a palace only using maybe a forth of the SP on 4 characters, compared to really pushing it back when I was on my first playthrough although I wasn’t great at the game back then
Didn’t mention difficulty lol
No, this is patrick
Fifth heart is >!Okumura!< though.
    ...fourth.

We'll say I said fourth.
        It would still cause a lot of worry though for teenagers who are all shown to have certain “issues”
Seriously. Maxing your social stats is the hardest part especially in the first playthrough. Do I hang out with Sojiro or try to my luck at the burger challenge?

Between the original P5 and P5R I wasn't sure if it was worth spending money for but man they dumped so much content in the game its basically a new game in itself.
    There's a bit of neat stuff in royal that I like added like QoL changes and technical attacks actually being useful, but man I loved Persona 5 so much I would have bought Royal anyway.
        Can you eli5 the tech attack changes? I picked up Royal a few days ago after doing p5 at release and I feel like I’m an idiot for not using technicals more but maybe they’re different now.
            Technicals knock down the enemy now, they didn't do that in vanilla p5
    I'd say always work on Confidants first. I only ever did Social Stat stuff if there was nobody to hang out with. I managed to 100% the game on my first playthrough of Royal
        That's pretty damn good. First playthrough in P5 I wasn't able to max out Futaba and my Kindness, but second and third I was basically completed everything. I'm at the sixth(?) palace right now with all my social stats maxed except for Knowledge. But most of my confidants are maxed out or nearing there.
            Oh, my first actual playthrough of regular P5 was a disaster lol. I didn't know much about the game, so I kinda winged it, and I think I only maxed like 4 Confidants. By the time Royal came out I'd already played P5 three times + P3 and P4, so I knew what I was doing.
I end up fast forwarding every time the exposition cat talks
    I swear I learn a new name for Morgana every day
I always want to replay the game but then I remember the long tutorial and what not, like yeah it’s rewarding but things make me stop or not even start
    I just got royal and finished the first palace and I feel like the gameplay loop is finally there. It is like a 10 hr tutorial. 

See I never finished, I had about 100 hours in my first save when it released and my ps4 bricked. I still don’t know how it ends so I’m super fucking hyped about royal and am having a great time lol.

    Yeah I’m now about 12 hrs in (some of that may have been me accidentally afking) but I’m just now having mementos explained again lol. I’m on hard so it was a little more grindy I guess.
For real???
    wait, ain't that bad?

    Yeah that's a bit of a flaw. They should have come up with some story reason to send the calling card on the last day like they did for others.
        Okumura goes out of town on business all of a sudden and will be back on the last possible day, so its the only option. Boom done.
            Yep that would work. They even established his restaurant being in Hawaii, so it wouldn't even seem farfetched that he has to leave the country for a bit.

I view it as stealing a mental illness. If you style the psychopathy from a psychopath or the depression from a depressed person, dont you think the person would be happier?
    Oh yeah, I do agree that overall the person is better off without the palace. My issue lands at the point where that person then has to deal with the guilt of everything that was done by what is... effectively sort of an evil alter-ego?
        If I told you that I could steal away something that is incredibly wrong with your mind, physically cut out part of you that was corrupt, with you full in the knowledge that you would be a significantly better person afterwards, with the only side effect being that you would view your past actions in a new light and probably wont like what you see, wouldnt you take that option for the potentially better future?
The first part, almost universally yes. The only person who I'm hesitant about giving life in prison is Madarame because it was only plagiarism but hes definitely still very bad. Second, you yourselves did the rehabilitation you. Changing someone's heart is like going into their mind and scooping out a mental illness
    madarame also physically and verbally abused his pupils, driving one of them to suicide, and let yusuke's mom die when he could've saved her. the second part could be hard to convict, but he could definitely confess to abuse and aid in a suicide along with the plagiarism.
    Yeah, but they never recover. They forever live in shame
        Are you trying to say a sex offender shouldnt pay for their crimes because that reputation will be with them for the rest of their lives?
            Not at all. I'm saying they should pay, but they won't ever get a chance to be a better person
                Of course they will? The very act of turning themselves in made them better people. Redemption is a long hard road but one available to everyone
                    The problem with the change of heart is that the fault was the person's distorted desires. In Persona 5 everyone who does bad things have a place in mémentos or even a palace (except for Phantom Thieves)

If you take their treasure away, you have essentially rehabilited them.

The very reason we put people in prison and punish them is for them to never commit crimes again, you want a society exempt of criminals. That's why in some countries like Norway, prisons are kinda like rehabilitation centers, with psychologists and various activities, they currently have the lowest recidivism rates of all so it works pretty well.

What I'm getting at is that people like Madarame, kaneshiro, kamoshida, etc... are already rehabilited once you take their treasures, they will beg for forgiveness and never commit crimes again.
The only reason to put they behind bars is for vengeance
                        So by your argument, if someone committed a horrendous crime a year ago but has since changed and become a better person, they shouldn't serve any jail time
                            Yes indeed, but it's impossible to tell if someone has really changed in real life, so they should still serve jail time. Perhaps have a house arrest or a probation. If the crime was minor maybe just a psychiatric test would suffice to assess if they changed for real.

In Persona 5 you are 100% sure the person has changed, things would be different if we knew for certain they'd never commit crimes again. 
The members of the phantom thieves either haven't thought about it much or either they are quite vengeful
                            Interestingly enough, I've read that "crime of passion" style murderers have some of the lowest recidivism rates of anyone who commits crimes, so maybe?

You'll know if you played through the game
“Hey lets go to the palace today” 



Well guess I’m banging my teacher today.
I do the same shit XD
Even if you are already max with her
All we need to do, is get a BOAT, Arthur, then we'll SAIL to Tahiti
    One LAST job!
        This is it gentlemen, the last one!...but we need money.
            Dutch: I have a plan John.

John: You always got a plan Dutch.

Dutch: This is a good one >!Jumps off a fucking cliff*...!<
>!Just as Dr. Maruki planned!<
    That honestly would be my ideal world.
    Just so you know, even when you spoiler tag it it’s still visible in someones notifications.

Even if it doesn’t matter in this case.
Now wait just a minute that’s not OK.
    Please just let me believe this game has no major flaws. Let me have this.
        I would, but Haru joins the party during that part. A great evil leads to you getting best girl.
    wait, ain't that bad?
I dunno, stressing out and incessantly texting your friends about it is what high school's all about for a lot of people, no?
    [deleted]
        I mean, you probably weren’t, you know, a world-famous criminal doing metaphysical crime with all your friends.

They have good reason to worry. And, at least for the first few palaces and after Okumura, they really couldn’t say for sure if their weird method would always work properly or not. Some skepticism is a good idea.

So, yeah, I think it was kinda annoying, but not terribly unrealistic or as whiny as you think.

Edit: added second and third paragraphs because I hit post too soon
        The point is that Joker is a non-average teenager who does not tell them to shut the fuck up, which is why he's a good leader.
            He's got the patience of a saint. You can only say "don't worry about it" so many times.
Spoiler alert: F*ck A*****, he is a traitor but Atlus made him look good in the end
    Akechi got Yabadabadood
I didn’t need that anyways. I’ll just rayman this bitch
Ah, the Russian special
thats what ended up sending joker to juvey in the end.
It’s explicitly mentioned around the start of the casino that they’re planning on pulling charges out of their ass and pinning them on whoever they get their hands on. They probably put murder charges (possibly poison-related) considering Okumura. Assault, intimidation, and stalking-related charges are very likely. Hacking is a given considering the Medjed incident, and trespassing, theft, and contraband-related charges would also be easily believable depending on how much they dig. 

In the Japanese criminal justice system, there’s an approximate 98% conviction rate since they generally only take surefire or high-profile cases to trial because of the obsession with prosecution success records, but they also have very lax interrogation rules and rely on signed confessions (Joker signing his name at the start) that they get through any means necessary. Not to mention you don’t have true jury trials in Japan so it’s up to a judge who can very easily just stamp it or be bribed in this universe and move on when they have the whole of national law enforcement banking on it. 

Japan does have capital punishment for some convicted murderers, though only the third years might be old enough for it. Even then it’s extremely rare until you reach the Japanese age of majority (20). However, this is the same system in-universe that wouldn’t blink about bullshit charges so it is entirely reasonable to assume the oldest team members would be executed if they were found or all of them would be subject to extrajudicial justice. The team is very right to be afraid, particularly when this is common knowledge and at least one or two team members (some of the ones eligible for capital punishment in fact) have firsthand knowledge of how they operate. 

TL;DR: They are making it up to whatever is half-believable and the system is in the exact right place to let it happen so they’re right to be this anxious.
    Don't we even see after Joker gets arrested that he gets a whole bunch of crimes of varying accuracy tacked onto him to justify the arrest of the leader of the Phantom Thieves?
And the whole time Sojiro is just like "that's how she is sometimes, whachagonna do?". like damn bitch, take your daughter to the hospital after the 2nd or 3rd day, at the \_most\_
    Day 14: no signs of activity. Sojiro insists that she's fine. I'm beginning to suspect that he may be responsible somehow.
Now that you pointed it out, using the photo makes no sense unless he has cops on his payroll like a certain guy or he just was hoping the kids were stupid enough to fall for it
    But he does though. He is part of the Conspiracy.
        The Phantom Thieves had no way of knowing that at that point, though
            True but Ohya did mention that Kaneshiro had some connections..that’s enough reason to be wary.
It would make for a more shocking moment but they were more concerned with clarity and baiting you with the other Persona user the game had been teasing since Madarame. I think your version makes for a better Okumura confession scene but the game version makes for a better story overall.
Yeah then at least then we might wonder if it was the Phantom Thieves fault and they screwed up but nah we get spoilt and spend the rest of the arc thinking 'no, you're obviously innocent you dummies'
still hasn't
    Not marked yet
        damn he still hasn’t done it
            Even now he hasn't done it
                how has he not done it yet
                    Ima be honest I dont think hes gonna do it
                        You might be right
In P5 Royal as soon as you get 50,000 yen and do the death confidant you can basically get through any palace in a day with lots of SP to spare with the SP accessory. Just switch the SP accessory between the party members. Also, buying the little 5 SP cans of soda every week in the school, bathhouse, and one other place I can’t remember nets 40 SP a week.
    You guys didn’t do every palace in one day in original p5?
        I could do it but it was much easier with the SP accessories. I’ll get through a palace only using maybe a forth of the SP on 4 characters, compared to really pushing it back when I was on my first playthrough although I wasn’t great at the game back then
...fourth.

We'll say I said fourth.
    It would still cause a lot of worry though for teenagers who are all shown to have certain “issues”
There's a bit of neat stuff in royal that I like added like QoL changes and technical attacks actually being useful, but man I loved Persona 5 so much I would have bought Royal anyway.
    Can you eli5 the tech attack changes? I picked up Royal a few days ago after doing p5 at release and I feel like I’m an idiot for not using technicals more but maybe they’re different now.
        Technicals knock down the enemy now, they didn't do that in vanilla p5
I'd say always work on Confidants first. I only ever did Social Stat stuff if there was nobody to hang out with. I managed to 100% the game on my first playthrough of Royal
    That's pretty damn good. First playthrough in P5 I wasn't able to max out Futaba and my Kindness, but second and third I was basically completed everything. I'm at the sixth(?) palace right now with all my social stats maxed except for Knowledge. But most of my confidants are maxed out or nearing there.
        Oh, my first actual playthrough of regular P5 was a disaster lol. I didn't know much about the game, so I kinda winged it, and I think I only maxed like 4 Confidants. By the time Royal came out I'd already played P5 three times + P3 and P4, so I knew what I was doing.
I swear I learn a new name for Morgana every day
I just got royal and finished the first palace and I feel like the gameplay loop is finally there. It is like a 10 hr tutorial. 

See I never finished, I had about 100 hours in my first save when it released and my ps4 bricked. I still don’t know how it ends so I’m super fucking hyped about royal and am having a great time lol.
    [deleted]
        Is there a new ending? I can tell that’s sarcastic because Atlus can’t think big brain like that
            There is a new ending, don't spoil yourself though.
Yeah I’m now about 12 hrs in (some of that may have been me accidentally afking) but I’m just now having mementos explained again lol. I’m on hard so it was a little more grindy I guess.
wait, ain't that bad?
Plot convenience. 

Idk why does it take until the next foggy day for new persona users to recover from the midnight channel?
Yeah that's a bit of a flaw. They should have come up with some story reason to send the calling card on the last day like they did for others.
    Okumura goes out of town on business all of a sudden and will be back on the last possible day, so its the only option. Boom done.
        Yep that would work. They even established his restaurant being in Hawaii, so it wouldn't even seem farfetched that he has to leave the country for a bit.
in storyline it would've been on the day of.

storyline vs gameplay segregation. 

like how if you do futabas early she sleeps for 3 weeks
Think of it as the same effect of how the change of heart seem to take effect on the target as the body slowly shuts down.
Well of course, but it is funny that the one time they stopped worrying about it, everything went horribly.
True. Possible that they wouldn’t have to worry about his heart changing, but there are too many other variables.
Didn’t he tell Makoto that he got rid of the pictures?
    Did he in the real world? When exactly? But like I mentioned, he has his thugs that for all we know could act on the blackmail in their leader’s stead and just abandon him to save their own hides.

His shadow did say he’d call of the debt but doesn’t mean the real one would.
        I remember shortly after completing his palace Makoto told the thieves in the group chat that Kaneshiro’s told her in a message that he deleted all of their pictures. But you have a point about his subordinates acting in his stead.
okay i think i worded that weirdly aha

i still stand on the 'Shadow going back to the host'  ensuring smooth sailing, though. but you're right about the legitimate concern though. the more 'high status' the target is means more higher risk.
I didn't skip them because I have OCD and wanted to experience the "full" story.
    wait until you reach your 7th, 8th or 9th playthrough
        This is in my top 5 and I can’t imagine playing it this much. People do it with Death Stranding too, I guess.
        It's such a long game? Why would you do that? Where do you have the time to do that?
            do i need a reason to play a game i like over and over?
        I would love to reach my 7th-9th playthrough but I don't have the mental preparation to play P5 again. I already am in my 4th playthrough... (I got the game on January 2020. Just for clarification that I don't own it since 2017.)
Oh boy played death stranding. So much repetitive dialouge
    How fucking GOOD THOUGH OMG
Mhm, I completely agree. However, if you are a psycho and have played the game 3 times (like me), it gets a little cringy at some points.
It kinda is, but P5 has been the absolute worst in that aspect from any Japanese media I know

I would love to reach my 7th-9th playthrough but I don't have the mental preparation to play P5 again. I already am in my 4th playthrough... (I got the game on January 2020. Just for clarification that I don't own it since 2017.)
Not at all. I'm saying they should pay, but they won't ever get a chance to be a better person
    Of course they will? The very act of turning themselves in made them better people. Redemption is a long hard road but one available to everyone
        The problem with the change of heart is that the fault was the person's distorted desires. In Persona 5 everyone who does bad things have a place in mémentos or even a palace (except for Phantom Thieves)

If you take their treasure away, you have essentially rehabilited them.

The very reason we put people in prison and punish them is for them to never commit crimes again, you want a society exempt of criminals. That's why in some countries like Norway, prisons are kinda like rehabilitation centers, with psychologists and various activities, they currently have the lowest recidivism rates of all so it works pretty well.

What I'm getting at is that people like Madarame, kaneshiro, kamoshida, etc... are already rehabilited once you take their treasures, they will beg for forgiveness and never commit crimes again.
The only reason to put they behind bars is for vengeance
            So by your argument, if someone committed a horrendous crime a year ago but has since changed and become a better person, they shouldn't serve any jail time
                Yes indeed, but it's impossible to tell if someone has really changed in real life, so they should still serve jail time. Perhaps have a house arrest or a probation. If the crime was minor maybe just a psychiatric test would suffice to assess if they changed for real.

In Persona 5 you are 100% sure the person has changed, things would be different if we knew for certain they'd never commit crimes again. 
The members of the phantom thieves either haven't thought about it much or either they are quite vengeful
                Interestingly enough, I've read that "crime of passion" style murderers have some of the lowest recidivism rates of anyone who commits crimes, so maybe?

Dutch: I have a plan John.

John: You always got a plan Dutch.

Dutch: This is a good one >!Jumps off a fucking cliff*...!<
He's got the patience of a saint. You can only say "don't worry about it" so many times.
True but Ohya did mention that Kaneshiro had some connections..that’s enough reason to be wary.
Even now he hasn't done it
    how has he not done it yet
        Ima be honest I dont think hes gonna do it
            You might be right
There is a new ending, don't spoil yourself though.
