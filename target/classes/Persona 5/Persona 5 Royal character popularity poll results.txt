[[Persona 5 Royal character popularity poll results]]





Ryuji stans in shambles
    when are we not tbh
    He's not really popular in Japan due to his vulgarity and informality about things sadly.
        To be honest, the English dub makes him a much more likeable character. He comes off like an ass in the Japanese track. I like the Japanese voice a lot, but his character there is much rougher around the edges.
            It‚Äôs not his fault his VA also voiced a deranged genius with a god complex holding a death note
        Are you kidding me? Miyano voiced him
        Like am not a big fan of him, didn't realize he wasn't liked over there.
            he‚Äôs just honest and doesn‚Äôt sugercoat anything that‚Äôs what i like about him. and he‚Äôs also a loveable idiot i find his japanese va hilarious
        As an Asian (not Japanese), i can confirm he is pretty annoying to me and my friends and we have no idea why Westerners love him so much

Louth-mouth people like loud-mouth characters?
            values varies between different cultures
            He's got a heart of gold and always has his friends' backs. He also happens to be a cutie pie.

He may be a loud idiot, but he's MY loud idiot.
                For me, he is like a combination of Kanji and Yosuke from persona 4
    Tbf, we were before the poll too.
    For real?!
    More in shambles than law bro üíÄ
    I think Max Mittelman's VA work elevates Ryuji a lot, so I get why he places so low on polls from Asia.

He's still best boy in my gay little heart
        The Japanese VA does a great job too! I like his character a lot even though I don't speak Japanese
            ^^^ this. i fell in love with Ryuji because of his JPN VA
                Ye mamoru miyano is op
                    Based pfp
        I don't think that has anything to do with it since his JP va is fantastic too. His character just doesn't seem to appeal to them.
        Ryuji's voiced by Miyano Mamoru in Japanese, who is one of the most ridiculously talented seiyuu in the industry.  What you said has absolutely nothing to do with why he places low in polls. He places low in polls because he's kind of a stupid asshole in a game full of characters that *aren't* stupid assholes.
            at least he does the big think like once or twice at palace 4. haven't finished the game but god dam, i won't be surprised if Ryuji was the sole reason everyone got caught despite the multiple loose ends our lovable crew leaves behind
            [deleted]
                What? Why would that make him more relatable in the West? There are people like Ryuji absolutely everywhere.
    well from what this poll shows it seems there aren‚Äôt many of you /j
    ‚Ä¶for real‚Ä¶
    Deserve-
    Temba, his arms wide.
    At least we got one over haru
    Haru fans were found dead in the ditch
    FOR REEAAALL
    He was always on the bottom half of all the polls I've seen.
Poor Haru can‚Äôt catch a break
    That's what I'm saying.. I wonder why she's so low..like geez..
        Arc stolen by Morgana moment.
            Haru got fucked.


Like Naoto was the last character to join the party in P4 too but she was already investigating the case and had contact with the party for  months in advance and upon joining the party becomes more or less the most important member given she's smarter than the rest of them (though that's a low bar lol) and basically becomes Velma and solves the mystery for the gang.



Haru just comes out of nowhere, her arc is half stolen by Morgana and then doesn't add much to the party. As much as I love her, she's not important to the story, I'm glad Strikers at least gave her a spotlight for a bit.
                Naoto kinda takes charge of the whole investigation the moment she joins since she's a detective.

Haru brings nothing meaningful to the table when she joins. And P5 has a real problem keeping characters relevant past their initial chapter.
            And never gets focus after that, except a few moments during the Akechi thing in Shido's Palace.

And is a background character for half the story.

And her confidant unlocks the latest of all of them.

And PQ2 also ditches her.

Thr only game that gives her anything is Strikers and it's only one arc and a few scenes.
Huh, if anything expected Akechi to poll higher. Everything else is around what I expected.

Haru really enters the game too late to garner a significant fanbase, though I did expect her to poll over Ryuji at the very least.
    The main problem i think is that a lot people who played p5 only once also didn‚Äôt do her confidant, i think its pretty good. My favourite female character is makoto and haru‚Äô confidant is way better that hers ( not a hard thing to achieve) but unfortunately most people are already busy with the other confidants at that stage of the game.
        Another issue, from what I heard, is that unlike most of the other characters, she doesn't get much story. So on top of getting her so late, she also suffers from non-interesting story syndrome. Something that was slightly fixed in Strikers where she got her own dedicated and lengthy story.

Haru was going to be a potential romantic option in my first cycle because I liked her as a character in Strikers, but I chose Futaba as a first cycle romance option because of her being an introvert, a nerd, and honestly just seemed like me if I was a girl born in Japan given my rough history with my dad. Not nearly as bad as what happened to her but still sucks.
            Also by that point most people probably already decided on a partner that is unfortunately not yusuke, so haru suffers from that as well, sumire doesn‚Äôt suffer from this problem cause even tho she becomes a romance option wayyy later in the game she gets teased at the start of the game and you regularly talk to her when she was a normal person so people could hold out for her.
            That first point is a good one. Ryuji and Ann have the same problem but at least they join at the beginning and are vital/essential in the recruitment of the next two Phantom Thieves.

After the Spaceport Palace, there is the Casino Palace where it is a Akechi, Futaba and Makoto show.

Then next is the Cruiser arc where again, I'd argue it was a good showing by Makoto and Futaba (Futaba really does get a lot of story content doesn't she)

Haru...other than the interaction with the TV exec is kinda just there like Ryuji
                I mean they all, sans Haru unfortunately, have a story to themselves. Ryuji was an ex-track member booted out by Kamoshida, Ann was forced into sexual relations with said corrupt teacher, Yusuke was lied to by his mentor who plagiarized art. And so much more. Haru just... doesn't get a lot.

            Exact opposite for me, it weren‚Äôt ‚Äúrich problems‚Äù, it was about trusting people, she couldn‚Äôt trust anyone because everyone seemed to be after her wealth and to control her life by putting on fake smiles, I found that kind of relatable, trusting people is a gamble and haru had the worst odds but still she persevered and tried to control her own life and ultimately it paid of *spoilers* when it turned out that the new ceo the person she distrusted the most was actually the only guy that was trustable, her gamble paid off and showed about showing a little trust can go a long way.
    Also Haru seems like the most boring girl in the entire game at face value
        I would give that to Makoto
            I love Makoto, but beep boop
                If I were to choose one to date, it would be Makoto since she seems to be the most faithful one. She's also willing to try and learn new things. She had a lot of fun playing in the game center. She's only boring if you are boring.
            Fuck you she has a bike (face value as in players perspective of course the other students don't know about Johanna)
                Bikes are cool but it doesn‚Äôt make up for how boring Makoto is.
                    1 you are jealous, 2 she pegs Ryuji, 3 you are jealous over 2, 4 you are right
                        Most mentally sane Makoto fan
                            Nahh the only thing I enjoy about Makoto is the bike and Ryuji. Apart from Tae, I would stan 2/3rds of the male characters before I begin thinking about the girls
            I spat my drink
    I find Haru's *character* likeable, but I think the (English) voice acting performance is awful, practically painful to listen to.  I'm not familiar with the actress so I won't speak to her ability in general, perhaps she just make an awkward choice for this role, but I find the performance jarringly bad to the point where it takes me out for a moment sometimes when I hear her.  The rest of the characters sound like characters having a conversation, then Haru breaks immersion by sounding like somebody reading from a script in a sound booth.

edit: to clarify I am referring to her English voice performance, not Japanese.
        Are you talking about the English dub? Because not only I've never heard her in it, I honestly couldn't care less.

This poll is either from Asia or worldwide (I found conflicting reports in the comments) so I imagine that's a non-factor as well. Most people outisde of English-speaking countries don't play with the English dub.

If you're talking about the Japanese voice, well then just agree to disagree, I really like Haruka Tomatsu's work with her.
            Yes, I am speaking of the English dub.  While I'm aware Persona has a global audience, as we're in the primarily-English Persona sub I assume that is typical of at a small majority of users here, though I am sure there are many like yourself who prefer to play with the Japanese dub.  As I do not speak Japanese, I do not, and I can only speak to my experience.
                But this thread is about an international poll and you're talking about the character's popularity based on a dub.

And honestly, even this sub has a lot of people with more strong opinions about the dub, I imagine like myself a lot tend to keep somewhat quiet because of how strongly dub fans tend to react to this kind of criticism.

You immediately jumped to the "I don't speak Japanese" crap like people who don't know English don't play translated games with the English dub (and if I got a penny every time I've seen native English speakers lash out or ridicule a foreign dub of an English-original property, let's just say I'd have a lot of pennies. But when people argue for original Japanese audio in Japanese games they're just le disgusting weeb right?)
                    I was speaking of *my personal* reasoning for putting Haru last on the list.  Further, I acknowledged in my comment that others who don't speak Japanese often play without the English dub, only explaining that I do and gave my personal reasoning.  I did not call you, or anyone, a weeb, or disparage anyone's language choice in any way.  You're reading a lot into this that I did not say or imply, and I feel like this isn't about me but rather I am being projected onto. I am not others, and any issues you have with others does not feel right to pin onto me.
                        My apologies, I didn't mean to imply that all applied to you or to lash out. I was similarly trying to describe my experience dealing with native English-speaking fans, but somewhere alonge the way I got too caught up in the venting lol. Sorry.
                            Apology accepted, thank you.  Cheers.
The top 5 are the popular archetypes for a typical high school anime.

Protag, Rival, Senpai, Kouhai, Imouto. It's a classic formula for a reason.
    Class rep is a trope of its own, too
    Huh, never realized that....wonder if that is why Ann is just out of the top 5 as Kasumi is basically the Kouhai of Persona 5 now and thus invalidating Ann
        Ann isn't a kouhai though. She's the classmate archetype who sits next to the protag.
        ? she was never that archetype.
        what skipping cutscenes does to a man
            Nahh if anything bro only watches cutscenes
    Not really. Protags are usually in shambles when talk is about harem animes. Ren took the W due to his showoff'ness and spectacular VA prolly
Anyone else feel that voting for a player-surrogate is the same as voting for yourself?
    At least Joker has *some* of his own personality assigned to him beyond the self insert nature of his character.
        Too bad the anime and strikers did him no favours and made him the second most nothing character in the series, Boy with Earring still not beats him though
            Yeah, they did nothing with him in strikers thats true. I was just talking about the main game itself tho.

The persona animes are....... a thing you could watch. I dont personally put much weight in them. They can be fun but they clearly arent meant to make a lot of sense or be consistent. They are just fanservice. Just look at the first scene in the P4 anime where Yu gets his persona...
                They made both Makoto and Yu interesting characters, so I give them props for that
                    Sure but they also made Yu nuke like 700 shadows into oblivion the second he got his persona.

The anime are for-fun fanservice as i see them, instead of serious additions to the characters writing or the plot.
                        That was for the Golden anime which was specifically supposed to emulate a new game plus run and show off the new stuff for P4 Golden

The original p4 anime he fights just 2 and it's a bit of a struggle as it show the original journey through P4.
                            Oh okay, ill have to check out the regular P4 anime.

I genuinely thought the golden one was all there was for 4.
                                Nah there‚Äôs a 20+ episode series that really gives Yu a character all his own and shows how he brings out the best in his team.

It also shows Yu‚Äôs shadow and his crippling abandonment issues
                                    Hmm. That sounds really good compared to the 4G and 5 ones.
                                The Vanilla P4 anime is amazing.  Highly recommend.
    Yeah but he looks cool AND you make him cool based on the dialogue choices. You kind of HAVE to like Joker
        Joker is my third least party member favourite character in the franchise, I‚Äôd take Ayase over Ren any day
            My bad, guess I just really like his design
                His design if fine, good even, but a character is more than their artwork 

The only characters I like less than him are Boy-With-Earring as he‚Äôs even less of a character than Ren, and Yukari who is the only character to actively piss me off with her attitude and actions.

I can‚Äôt like Ren as a character because there is no character there to like.
                    Yeah I get that, self inserts are difficult to put a personality onto but I'm big on making the character mine so they always have a consistent character rather than whatever I find funny. It really is just up to how you play games
                        The issue is that not only have they given both Makoto and Yu personality in other works, they are good personalities that elevate the interactions and connections with the other characters 

In regards to Ren however they have gon on record and said said giving him personality limits what they can do with him, which is nonsense as him not being allowed to have personality is even more limiting in how scenes can play out, and feels like they are desperate not to say ‚Äúso that the player/watcher can pretend to have friends or a girlfriend‚Äù
                            Yeah, I do agree but self inserts are personal preference
                                I find they only work when you have a significant amount of dialogue options, very frequently. For example Dragon Age: Origins, Divinity Original Sin 2, or Knights of the old Republic 2.

The way Persona handles it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhow do you want to react to this‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äústoic, sarcastic, or goofy, pick one‚Äù it just feels lazy and jarring to have so little come from the main character who interacts with so many well written characters
                                    I see your point. I haven't played origins, but I have played Inquisition, and there are lots of dialogue choices, and they definitely have a bigger impact compared to persona 5. They also give you ways to actually build a coherent character with some nuance, like how it's tracks your position on being the Herald of Andraste and religion. I guess I just didn't expect much depth going into Persona 5 and focused on who looked cool. I had heard before playing that the story was kinda shallow, so I guess I focused on who looked coolest
#0 Joker's Car, #1 Joker.
    Joker‚Äôs car is literally #8
        True!

    Is this a Chainsaw man reference or‚Ä¶.
        Perhaps....
Since this is a SEGA poll, it‚Äôs done by those in Southeast Asia.

So this poll makes sense given the region.
    How come?
        People don‚Äôt like that same things as we do in the west.
        basically asia has bias for cute and smart characters
            [deleted]
        Japanese players love their silent protags.
    I'm actually surprised Akechi didn't come second, he's pretty popular in Japan.
haru :/
[deleted]
    Ridiculous xD
Fake news Haru #1
    She is \#1. From the bottom.
    I don't see how she is.
Why do people like the god damn protagonist over actual characters
    Probably because he is a self insert and I've noticed that self insert characters are VERY popular, much more so than in N.America

Kirito of SAO is widely mocked and hated here in the west as being one of the most blatantly bad examples of a Gary Stu. 

Yet his popularity in Japan pretty much brought to the forefront the self insert overpowered, harem collecting isekai.genre we have now

It isn't that we in the west don't do Gary stun(see Harry Potter) but I don't think we are as explicitly blatant.

There's also the fact that Joker does have a personality based on the anime (slight that it is) and I imagine anyone responding to a Persona 5 poll in SEA is also familiar with the anime and that undoubtedly has an effect on their perception of Joker
        I‚Äôd argue he has a little bit of personality in the game, not much but there is something. Also things like his phantom thief outfit may be a factor as well.
        Harry Potter is not a Gary Stu, he sucks so bad at so many things; half of the books felt like him luckily stumbling through the obstacles more than anything else. I was always annoyed at how he sucked at things when I read the books while I was younger. He‚Äôs more of a brave idiot than anything else.
            Yeah the only thing he was the best at was combat. He was the best duelist in his batch and that's it
It is inconceivable to me that people like Morgana over Ryuji and Haru
    He's only one spot above Ryuji tbf...
    Japan really doesn't like ryuji because he's a delinquent who rebels against authority, in a game about rebelling against authority
        Yet they have no qualms against the rebel leader and a cyber terrorist. I think it's just because Ryuji is loud, obnoxious, and--I say this with love--dangerously stupid at times.
            I guess Junpei or Yosuke weren't very well received then since they are at least two of those - possibly all three. Haven't played 3 but I imagine Junpei is among the first people the protag meets and among the first that gets his Persona.
                Japan respects intelligence and in the games I‚Äôve played (3-5) I feel like Yosuke is one of the most intelligent party members you get. Sure he isn‚Äôt book smart but he really sets the pace and leads the investigation until Naoto joins. Most of the progress they make comes from Yosuke and he‚Äôs kind of the stand-in for the silent protagonist in terms of deductions and abstract thinking.
                Yosuke feels much more different than Ryuji. I think they went too far with the loud and dumb personality of Ryuji in the main story, he's like some caricature. Yosuke is more like a normal highschooler and is extremely popular in Japan.
                    I dunno. Ryuji is more endearing than anything. Mostly because I do enjoy more slapstick goofy characters with a badass streak, Yosuke is in that league too by the way - by way of just being the butt monkey of the Investigation Team along with Teddie and sometimes Kanji.
                        I think the difference is that Yosuke is responsible (he has a job), smart, and not as loud and as aggressive as Ryuji.
                Er no. The loud, physical, dumbass rough and tumble character of the Investigative Team is Chie (she is the Strength Arcana for a reason)

Junpei IS of the Strength Arcana but I would never consider him the rebel, delinquent of the SEES team
                    Strength? Weren't they Chariots?
                        Junpei is Magician
                            Oh right, my bad.
                        Whoops...yeah I meant Chariot.

 I am a little bit disappointed that people. constantly equate Yosuke with Jumpei and Ryuji when Chie is RIGHT THERE

It isn't like Chie joins the game at the end like Haru.....
                            It's because Yosuke plays the role of the best friend from the start so people will most likely draw parallels with characters who play a similar role (but then it should be Yukari instead of Junpei lol, she feels much more like a bro than him).

Though ngl, my big reason for not associating Yosuke with Ryuji unless I'm making a comparison that's favorable to Ryuji is because he's wholesome while Yosuke is homophobic (and being bi... I just cannot bring myself to like a homophobic character).
                                Yosuke was originally designed to be bi as well, which is where the internalized homophobia comes from. Since they cut the romance he ends up just seeming like an asshole but he does grow and towards the end of the game I feel like he genuinely accepts Kanji and gets over his prejudice.
                                I actually agree with you. Female protagonist of persona 3, yes, Junpei is her best friend among the SEES team

But regular male protag? I NEVER got the impression they were friends much less best friends. Yukari, yeah I'm there with you

Which furthermore drives me up a wall when those 3 get equated. The only commonality between the three is that they are the first person to join your party
                                    And not even that, in fact, as I'm pretty sure Yukari joined before Junpei in 3 lmao. They're just the first dudes.
                Nah I've seen Yosuke quite high up on these polls
        I‚Äôm Asian, but not Japanese. We generally don‚Äôt like Ryuji because he‚Äôs rude and annoying. We don‚Äôt like muscle-bound idiots
        It's more like Japan and East Asia don't like dumb people.
    Haru has NPC energy.
        out of everybody in the cast, i honestly thought she had the most potential to be black mask.
    It really isn‚Äôt.

Mascots and cats are well liked by people in regions.

Also if one bothered to pay attention to detail and nuance in character writing then Morgana is solid with what his character and story is all about.

There‚Äôs a lot to discuss.

Ryuji as good as he is, is a simple straightforward character where there‚Äôs not a lot of discussion surrounding him compared to the rest.
        My favorite kinds of people are people from regions
        I think morgana is one of the better written ones among the phantom thieves, if he had an actual confidant it would have been even better. But people just blindly hate on the superficial aspects and completely ignore his internal struggles,these are the same people who run away from a problem/equation rather than trying to understand it.
            Personally I think his confidant worked out being main story as it acknowledges plot events. Plus there‚Äôs his endgame role.

Considering that Mona is mostly with us 24/7, can‚Äôt exactly see him as a manual confidant.
                Yeah, might have had the opposite effect and make people even more mad. I personally would have loved one, a confidant which explores insecurity and fear of losing a home. Or they could have done it like the twins and have 2 ways of interaction.
                    His existing confidant already kinda hints at that though. 

Like the times he confides in Joker, you can sense the insecurity he has building up till it boils around the Okumura arc.

I assume you wanted more via access to a manual one so it adds more layers on top of the existing main story scenes?
                        Yup thats right, and if you do all of that you get special scenes with morgana at the end of the story,  like how you get extra dialogue from lavenza about her love if you do all the twin requests. most confidants explore one topic like ryuji with moving on, yusuke and motivation etc.., insecurity is a much bigger and interesting topic that i would love to be shown in depth with morgana.
            Imo his character is also written really cleverly in regards to his Arcana as well

The Magician represents the concept of ‚Äúas above, so below‚Äù‚Äî meaning heaven and earth reflect each other, microcosms and macrocosms reflect each other, the ‚Äúinner world‚Äù of the self and the ‚Äúouter world‚Äù reflect each other, etc. In Persona, the Metaverse and reality reflect each other. The Magician additionally represents the  ability to travel between these two worlds, just like how Morgana acts as the Thieves‚Äô guide to the Metaverse.

The Magician Arcana can also represent someone ‚Äúcoming into their own‚Äù, just like how Morgana finds his place in the world and among the Phantom Thieves despite his insecurities.
            I‚Äôm in a weird spot for Morgana because I agree he has some depth with his internal struggles about who he is and where he came from BUT I can not stand the him ditching the phantom thieves. I was so annoyed with that entire arc and it easily my least favorite part every time I play.

It also just annoys me from a story writing perspective because it robbed Haru of her story but that‚Äôs off subject.
        Also if one bothered to pfbtbthbfht
        I agree, I don‚Äôt really get the hate for Morgana on this sub. I felt pretty indifferent towards him during my first playthrough, he was just the cute cat character that was annoying sometimes. 

Ryuji on the other hand is downright one of the worst main cast Persona characters imo. He won‚Äôt shut the fuck up about booba and how much he deserves money, chicks, and power just because he‚Äôs a phantom thief. They nearly get caught because of his ego/stupidity and he still screams about being a thief in public because ‚Äúlulz that‚Äôs just how real teenagers act xDD‚Äù. Literally none of the other characters act half as stupid. He was great for the first 10 hours of the game and then dove straight to rock bottom in terms of character development.
            Don‚Äôt exactly agree there with your assessment of Ryuji.

Him acting like that is very much the point of his main story character arc where he has to develop from his flaws of being an immature glory seeker that wants to be a famous hero that gets rewarded and acknowledged to make up for how much of a loser he is in the real world. As well as being someone who doesn‚Äôt see the value and appeal of being ‚ÄúA Hero that lurks in the shadows‚Äù as opposed to those in the limelight.

He actually does develop past that mindset post Okumura arc with their downfall giving him a wake up call and humbling him.

I disagree with the notion that teenagers wouldn‚Äôt act like him. Mishima with drunk on power he was and insecure about being a ‚Äúzero‚Äù is not that different from Ryuji‚Äôs attitude.

Any immature teenager that is a loser with nothing big going on for them in life naturally would take having superpowers with real gusto.

Reason why the other Thieves aren‚Äôt like that is because they have some silver lining in the real world which isn‚Äôt like your typical teenager (barring Morgana who has it worse due to no memories or identity):

Ann is a successful model, Makoto is student council president and honour student, Yusuke is an aspiring artist, Futaba is a hacking prodigy that was the founder of a hacking vigilante organisation, Akechi is the 2nd coming of the detective prince and Kasumi is a talented gymnast. 

Joker can make something of himself in the real world due to the player.
                I also want to add that the only reason why Ryuji has nothing going on for him in the real world is that Kamoshida fucked up his knee. If not for that, he would be a successful runner. That would be his "silver lining".
                    Yep. Nice follow up.

Ryuji‚Äôs story of having a career ending injury is similar to Anna Yoshizaka from Persona 2.
                I mean, sure losers can aspire to have power because they don't have anything in the real world. But Joker is on probation and nearly risked losing his entire livelihood because of Ryuji's stupid mistakes/inability to control himself. And while Ryuji was very well aware of Joker's situation, his desire for attention took precedence over the safety of his own supposed "best friend". My point is that the whole theme and motif of the Phantom Thieves is that they work anonymously because there are legitimate real-world consequences they must face if their identities are revealed. They reject the status-quo of society and manifest their own brand of justice by their own means, whether it's right or wrong. They are NOT superheroes. Nearly every character related to the Phantom Thieves, sans Ryuji and Mishima, is aware of this fact. I'm not a fan of writing a character as a complete dumbass with zero common sense for the sake of trying to portray an inferiority/hero complex.

Admittedly I'm only halfway through my second playthrough after years of playing vanilla P5, but I don't recall Ryuji drastically improving after the Okumura arc. From what I recall, he was almost like an entirely different person during his social link vs the main story. Yes, Okamura was Ryuji's lowest point as a character. But he doesn't really do anything to make up for it afterward or have any redeeming qualities to his character post-Kamoshida that make him endearing to me.
    Personally Ryuji is probably my most disliked out of the Phantom Thieves. He just gets on my nerves idk. I love Yusuke though lol, he's my best boy
        Ryuji used to piss me off during my first playthrough because he was constantly shouting **HEY EVERYBODY WE'RE THE PHANTOM THIEVES!** To everyone in a 20 kilometer radius.

That being said, I've replayed the game many times and he really grew on me. Haru is still best girl though and it's a travesty that she isn't ranked higher.
            >constantly shouting **HEY EVERYONE WE'RE THE PHANTOM THIEVES!** To everyone in a 20 kilometer radius

Tbf, they are a group of 16 year-olds. That's the most realistic thing in the entire game
                16 year olds are not that dumb, ryuji is just mentally 5
                    I don‚Äôt mean to generalize, but I‚Äôve seen 16 year olds do way dumber things than Ryuji, so it‚Äôs not that unrealistic
        My man!! Yusuke,akechi and maruki are my holy trinity of persona 5 characters.
    The problem Haru has is that she's really more of a P5S character with a P5/P5R cameo
    I like Morgana and Ryuji about equally and I prefer Morgana to Haru (she just doesn't get enough screentime for me to get attached)
    Well considering that its Asian poll it makes more sense. His Jap VA is MUCH less unbearable
    Morgana isn't as awful as Teddy from 4 but he is trying.
Most people voted for... themselves? "My favourite character is me, he's got all the coolest Personas."
    Imo, despite being the silent type of protagonist, you can see glimpses of his personality in the answer options. He embodies many traits that people look up to, (as well as giving ppl the opportunity to project themselves onto him, that's true).
        I do totally understand that Joker has character, his bond with Akechi despite the players actual feelings being a core trait. I just find it kinda disappointing that most people choose the self-insert over the actual characters.

Joker definitely deserves a good ranking for the personality shown in answer choices and his unique personas (arsene etc), but not necessarily first place.
            Oh, when you put it that way, I agree.
    I mean it's game over if he goes down, he's obviously the most important.
Haru being last hurts my heart
ryuji deserves better
    Ryuji can take the L in stride. The boy has been through worse.
    Disagree
    In the same place with Demifiend
where adachi
     They hid him to avoid public panic ü§Øü§Øü§Ø.
To me, this is just Anne and Haru slander and I will not stand for it
Ngl surprised that sad boy Akechi isn‚Äôt higher
    It's not a poll made in Japan or US, so that's why
my boy is in 9th place, less popular than a cat lmfaoooo
Where do you get this form? Wanna know if this is global and jp poll.
    This poll only covered Southeast Asia.
Ryuji doesn't deserve that! Yes he is not that bright but h√© is an agreable companion compared to Teddy or Junpei...
Haru, Ryuji and Yusuke are my favorites, sad to see them so low
My hot take is that while I like the Phantom Thieves as a group, I don't find any of the individual characters particularly compelling compared to those from 3 and 4. Like there isn't a single one that I can point out and say that I'm particularly fond of or attached to.
Why is Kasumi so high? Really want to know, because people don't like Haru for joining late and "having no personality", but to me this is just like Kasumi. I don't dislike her, but she comes so late into the game and differently from Maruki, she felt added into the game, like an afterthought. Well, it's my opinion anyway, no hate to any character, because the game is very good, much better than P4, honestly!
I never understood the love for Makoto
    Shes cool and I like how assertive she is
        I just kinda feel like they made every other character stupider when she joined to make her look smart by comparison when she never really does anything smart or has good plans or anything.

She looks cool and I enjoy the angry overachiever archetype but I just feel she‚Äôs a bad example of it.
            I don't see it personally as neither Ryuji or Ann's characterizations really made them out to be gifted academically, Yusuke is solely focused on his art, Joker's a blank slate self insert, and all of Morgana's knowledge is specialized and related to palaces/personas. Makoto showing up and having a slight edge on her classmates intellectually doesn't bother me as she's both a year older and presented as a student who's focused on her academic career. If they made her out to be some kind of super genius prodigy with a towering intellect then I'd be more inclined to agree with you and call her unrealistic but instead she comes across as a well read teenager with booksmarts but no street smarts.

Makoto is the reliable party member who outside of Joker deals most with Akechi, sometimes acting like a liason. She reviews and provides more input on plans outlines than the others and the whole heist on Sae's Palace sees her heavily involved with the preparation of the baits and switches. She does a decent amount of heavy lifting in her own right, I think people just lose sight of that because she's less outwardly wacky than all the others. Her dumb decisions mostly stem from hubris and naivetey rather than actual idiocy so for all of that I think she's consistent and believable as a smarter than average teenager.

I still respect your opinion though
                My only problem with Makoto's intelligence is when she does really stupid shit and it's treated as though she's being smart.

Like we find one of Kaneshiro's men and instead of trying to extract information or tail him we get this:

Makoto: Hello there suspicious looking hooligan. Are you selling illegal substances by chance? 

Makoto: I think that guy was part of the Mafia...

That's some Ryuji level subtly there...
                    Or to make Makoto look smart she becomes semi omnipotent.

Like I just passed the Okumura section and when Futaba explains the Phan site had been hacked Makoto says something like:

"Well obviously then we were set up to take down Okumura by the cause of the mental shutdowns and they know who we are."

There's more possible explanations than that. The Phantom theifs are household names right then and not just the villians wanted Okumura to have a change of hearts. But Makoto is "smart" so she gets to skip all the incorrect possibilities so she can be correct.
                        I mean... it's a suggestion? It's not like she 100% knew it. She dropped a hypothesis to consider.
                            My problem is that the hypothesis was flawless at the time. Theoretically, the character wouldn't know they're correct, but hindsight shows it was pretty much perfect.

It's not really the only time, just the one that most took me out of the moment.

Her suspecting you as Phantom Theifs because you had problems with Komoshida. The whole volleyball team had an issue with him. christ, he raped a girl, there's quite a few people who'd want to get him.

She perfectly gets to Kaneshiro by demanding some random thugs take her there. Somehow, it works flawlessly, and she doesn't have something worse than a threat happen to her.

She gets into Kaneshiro's palace, having been in the metaverse for 5 minutes.

Hope I'm not coming off as rude or dismissive. This was my thought process during the game, these could absolutely be problematic to me and not you, just wanted to share something I saw as a flaw during my playthrough.
                                Idk, I really don't feel like it's that farfetched or crazy of a hypothesis to make. All of the thieves have constantly been saying "things have been going too smoothly" to indicate how they think there's a possibility all of it is scripted. They know that there's a third party involved because of the black mask too. The hypothesis makes sense imo.

Also, while there are others who hate Kamoshida, you're the only one who had an actual vocal problem about him. Everyone suffering keeps quiet, and those that don't suffer are ignorant usually. Plus, you arrive at the school, and in the span of a month you start beefing with him, he's about to expel you and he confesses to his crimes on the day that you're supposed to get expelled. The coincidences are too great to not suspect Joker and his crew tbh.

The Kaneshiro situation is just dumb luck though. Sure it was "the correct play" in hindsight, but everyone agreed that it was a stupid thing to do and out of character. She even feels bad about it and apologizes. Maybe you can argue they got off too easily, but that's a different issue than Makoto at that point.

Idk, I just never really felt like she was being too big brained in the main story.
                    I thought that was the point honestly? Like her being book smart but not actually good at "in the moment" smart.
                        See that's a fine flaw to have--but she's treated as if she's being intelligent in the moment, when she's really not.
                            You're the only person there though, you can decide if you want to praise her or not.

Plus she says some dumbass shit like "he was dodging all my traps", like there's no way they wanted you to take her seriously. It just shows how she doesn't really get how people work.
                                I'll have to double check, but didn't both of Joker's options say that he was impressed or something to that effect?
                                    You can do that in some cases, but the rest of the team immediately shames you for not praising the Queen. It's like every reaction but praise is a crime
                                    Well yeah, two of them. But aren't there three? So just don't go for that option and she doesn't get praised.
                    She addresses that herself though, stating she messed up by being too desperate to be useful to someone.  It‚Äôs a trait of hers that she learned to overcome.  Unlike say, Ryuji who remains pretty dumb and loud throughout the story.
Too anyone that‚Äôs surprised that Ryuji is in 9th place keep in mind he‚Äôs not that liked, let alone loved in Asian based countries like Japan for example
Morgana is once and for all established to be better than Ryuji, get rekt haters.
    I really really like Morgana tbh
    In a poll only covering one part of Asia. Ryuji still the better party member
Ann, Ryuji, Futaba, Haru, Yusuke, Makoto, Morgana, Kasumi, Akechi, Joker for me 

I am really attached to the first 6. Kasumi is well-written but I just couldn't spend enough time with her and her lack of interactions with the rest besides Joker and Akechi made her more boring for me. Akechi is well-written just not my type of favourite character. And Joker is...silent....
    Yeah kinda surprised to see Joker first (not surprised that he's in the top 3 but first ?)

Like yeah I get it he's the protagonist but the whole point is that he has almost no personality outside player input and rarely speaks unlike a Cloud or a Kiryu

It's just kinda weird for him to be anyone's favorite character but hey I ain't judging
        I think its because blank slate characters are easiest to latch onto. The lack of any voice acting makes it so you can give him any tone while choosing responses. That's my logic anyway, I tend to make him the reasonable authority between the outgoing Ryuji, the cocky cat thief Morgana, and the sweet but sometimes whiny Ann (no hate to her, I love her too). Who are the closest friends to the protag compared to the characters coming later, since the four of them went through the most palaces together (Kamoshida onward).
    I see you‚Äôre a fellow Ann enjoyer.
        Yesss I love her character. The way she own her personality and beauty is really inspiring. Also the feeling of being different somewhere where being different is frowned upon is really relatable.
            And her romantic interactions are so cute ü•∞
                I haven't seen them cause I usually don't go to any romance routes. I mean...persona is really limiting for a gay guy but the bro hang outs are cool enough. Ann always felt like that first girl bff you make that you share your spicy life stories with I we a fun sleepover lmao.
    Joker shows more personality in the times he does speak than entirety of the cast though. Not bashing rest of the cast, but his VA is too good
Makoto stay winning üí™üí™üí™
This warms my Shumako heart

Bit sad for Haru tho
I really don't grt why Kasumi is that popular...

I mean she's no Marie but I still didn't think she was anything too special.
Haru stans drinking IPA's and playing video games like Vampire Masquerade, Alice PC, Grim Fandango, OMORI, The Ship, Psychonauts

Listen to music with ‚ñ≤ and Œ£ in the titles and artist's names
I still can‚Äôt wrap my head around why Kasumi is so popular even though she barely had a presence in the game until the Third Semester, and even then she gets overshadowed by Maruki.
All my favs (except for Joker ofc) are in the right column...
Honestly, the only parts of this list I find surprising are Joker ranking first and Ann ranking above Yusuke.
    Protagonists are almost always the most popular characters in asian polls.
        Interesting, I wasn\`t aware of that.
        >Protagonists are almost always the most popular characters in asian polls.  


Yeah when they are not silent, Aigis & Yosuke were top 1 in asian poll, yu and makoto (p3) were not even top 5 in p3 & p4 poll
            The ones that i found had them pretty high up though..

Kasumi really turned out to be my favorite romance option in any JRPG, I'm glad she's so high on the list
The first 4 are alright. Goro imho suck in both versions of him.
    it really annoys me how obsessed people are with him tbh he legit murdered countless people
        "He mUrDeREd CoUNtlEsS PeOpLe"

Man you wouldn't survive playing Shin Megami Tensei LMAO
            Im always surprised why people like this can't appreciate a good villain in a story, millions of people love Darth Vader because of what he brings to the story but we're suppose to hate him because he killed loads of people is stupid.
                Same, sincerely Akechi isn't even the worse villain in a JRPG, and he's actually vanilla like AF compared with the other personas

The most interesting character in P5 for sure is him, so I don't get who think that people can't actually understand he's not right in his choices and still like this character

Like I said, wouldn't survive playing a SMT game
                    never said he was the worst character, simply stated idk why people love him sm when hes a mass murderer. you‚Äôve further proved my point
                        Because he's well written lmao also no one needs a reason to like a character, I can't understand who likes Yusuke or Haru too much either, but who cares? Why you like or not a character is a matter of personal taste

I like characters that are complex more than simple juvenile ones, that's why ¬Ø‚Å†\‚Å†_‚Å†(‚Å†„ÉÑ‚Å†)‚Å†_‚Å†/‚Å†¬Ø

But sincerely if I give my real opinion about P5 this sub will ban me
            i would survive them, i just wouldnt be chill with the serial killer characters, sorry if that triggers u
Based. Akechi and Kasumi are by far the best written of the main cast. Good to see people have good taste.
    Kasumi is the worst written character in the entire series
        Responded to a 3 month old comment whilst dropping a horrible take. Yikes.
            A dismal take
Who likes joker more than anyone in my opinion (yes I‚Äôm a simp) my character lost goes like 1 sojiro
2akechi 3yusuke 4ryuji 5futaba 6morgana 7makoto 8 yoshizawa 9haru 10 joker 11an joker doesn‚Äôt have a personality he‚Äôs just you in essence
I'm actually pretty pleased with how this turned out! Sad Yusuke is a little lower on it though. Hey, at least Akechi, Makoto, and Ren are in the top 5! Love those three. 

I need to get invested in the community more-
They need this poll in the west
Kinda find it odd that our protagonist is number 1.   
You don't bond with yourself so like...I don't get it? What's the likeable factor I'm missing? We don't even talk.
I never understood the hard love for the MC it's not even up until the anime that you get to see the MC interacting as himself with the rest. Like I get it, nothing against it, but they usually take the number 1 spot. Maybe it's a Japanese thing where they really like the quite MC where they get to quite literally RP as the character, I can only imagine it's a Japanese student's dream to wish their life was like that or something. Prob why a lot of animes are based on high-school groups, since it's probably the mangakas dream during that time that they wish to express themselves more than just a strict repetitive life at school. Maybe too deep, but it's interesting to think about.
Wack af
Im kinda dissapointed seeing Joker being #1
For me he has so little personality in comparison with the other phantom thieves
surprised Yusuke is above Ryuji I didn't realize he had a fanbase
    You didn‚Äôt know yusuke had a fan base? Are you fucking serious?
Joker is 1st and Makoto is right next to him. As it should be.
    Based
Morgana over Ryuji is a crime
Lowkey disappointed in my people

Yusuke and haru are so low lmao but whatever everyone has different opinions
How tf morgana is better than ryuji?
Confirmed: Makoto Best Girl!
How the fuck is Morgana above ryuji
I would never understand why people in this sub likes Ryuji lol. 

Are they self inserting as him?
    I have a soft spot for characters who are dumb and rowdy but surprisingly emotionally intelligent, I guess.
        I think you mean emotionally assertive. He's able recognize and display his own emotions, thoughts, and feelings to those around him. He's open and honest with the way he feels at all times and he isn't afraid to hide himself.   


While this is a good character trait for him because it helps better show off the simplicity in his nature, it is indirectly different from emotional intelligence, which would be more like understanding how others feel.
        >Ryuji


>emotionally intelligent

Pick one
        >surprisingly emotionally intelligent

Doubt.

Did you see his spat with Morgana, or when he made fun of Ann crying over him?
            [deleted]
                I have seen this before but I don't get the tantrum argument. From basically the start of his social rank, Morgana has been unsure about his place in the world

An emotionally intelligent person like Haru can pick up on this and not target those insecurities...and what does Ryuji do?
                    You don't even need to be emotionally intelligent. Even Futaba knew Ryuji was fucking up big time.
                You mean when Ryuji kept pushing Morgana's buttons despite him clearly being upset about it, and then made a half-assed apology, then yes. 

They were both insufferable. Ryuji isn't as emotionally intelligent as people like to claim him as lol.
    Same. His constant anger issues and screaming are annoying af. So many situation would've been resolved easier if he just stayed silent. Also his boner for popularity was lowkey annoying too. I don't need to mention him being an ass towards morgana
        To be fair about the Morgana part, he literally just attacked Ryuji upon first meeting him and hasn't stopped being mean to him since, even in battle. *Of course* Ryuji would fight back, being a teenager (and a more abrasive one at that).
From the waifu war perspective, you really gotta give it to Futaba.

Sure, she's coming in third in that arena, but that's only following the default choice and the girl Atlus pushed for SummerSlam. 

Don't get me wrong, Makoto is a great character, but I feel like the majority of her appeal as a waifu is that there's nothing to get hung up on, she's the smoothest and safest of any of the girls.

Yoshizawa on the other hand has a ton of hang ups you gotta get past, but Atlus wrote her so direct that I'm sure plenty of people fell for her due to the brute force of it. To be clear, she's also a great character, and very cute as well.

Futaba also has stuff people get hung up on, from her seeming too "immature", to the perception some have that her and Joker are like siblings, it's bad enough that some folk will cast judgment on you for liking her over the other girls. And yet she's right that at the top of the list. Godspeed, Gremlin Gamer Girl.
    Isn't Makoto's tendency to lose her temper a big hang up? And her "no bullshit" attitude? I know it's a meme but she's not actually a robot. Her character is just a more grounded one in a game full of anime tropes and moments, so she just isn't as attention grabbing on-screen as other characters.
    Dude, the majority of her appeal as a waifu is that she would be the most faithful one and the one who needs help the most in "discovering" the world and trying new things. Plus she seems to like gaming which is a great plus. Realistically speaking, she's the perfect package for a good wife.

Futaba also needs help, but at the end of her confidant level she becomes independent. And like you said, many people see her more like a little sis. She would come second after Makoto for me though.

Ann and Haru are basically independent strong girls who are out of league for most people in real life. They would end up dating celebrities or high spec dudes in the future.

I'm finishing Royal now, but I didn't get to see full Yoshizawa yet, but she also seems to be immersed in her athlete career and gives the vibe of not having too much time to spend on other things that is unrelated to her career.
I have yet to play Royal, so it seems Akechi is a lot more involved than the base game.

Poor Haru, but at least Makoto is cemented as best girl.
I'm going to be downvoted here, but I'm just gonna say it.

Queen is overrated.
Who tf voted joker as their favourite?
    It's probably about looks and projection.
Bruh I still don‚Äôt get why Makoto is so high. Maybe if we count in strikers but I liked that version cuz fist to swarms of enemies
    Wasn't she specifically made to be the ideal Japanese woman?
        She's the ideal woman period. Ann may be the lovers arcana but atlus never misses the chance to tell us "hey check out these two nerds! Aren't they cute together?"
Also Ryuji is ass
    I don‚Äôt hate him, but slowly finding him overrated the more time I spent in this subreddit. I don‚Äôt get why people like him over Yusuke and Morgana
        Agree. I do get that he's a good guy, but sometimes he's completely insufferable
Considering the amount of fanart i've seen, i thought Akechi and Futabas places would've been swapped. 

&#x200B;

Also, Haru i'm so sorry.....
People actually like Kasumi?
makoto and futaba being some of the highest, as it should be. but ryuji should be higher smh
Just as I expected Ryuji and Yusuke were in the bottom because eccentric and bashful characters aren't favoured highly in the east.

The top 5 don't really surprise me they're more relatable and resonate with the SEA population and all had good to top tier arcs in the story.
    Ryuji, bashful? Eccentric?

Do you mean brash?
        Ryuji: Bold and Brash
Just a few more polls till Kasumi surpassing Makoto.
    Yes we need this
I don't understand
Why everyone
LOVES MAKOTO
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who disliked Ryuji.  Going by this subreddit I thought I was in the minority but glad to see I‚Äôm not.
Makoto, overrated as usual. Other than exaggerated intelligence, she has nothing over any of the other characters.
    She's literally the only character that isn't an overblown anime trope.
        Lol no. Ryuji is arguably the most realistic out of all of them.
            Bruh what he's literally a delinquant that yells 24/7. That's pretty damn overblown.
                If you‚Äôre closed minded and don‚Äôt read between the lines, yeah. The circumstances that lead up to him being a delinquent is part of why and how he came up with the idea of everyone becoming PTs. He was verbally and physically abused as a child by his father and by his PE teacher. As a result of Kamoshida‚Äôs comments about his mother, he lost his temper which made him lose his track scholarship to help take care of his mother. When he needed emotional support/guidance throughout the situation, his peers and teachers crucified and blamed him for the entire situation. He was essentially gaslighted for defending himself against Kamoshida‚Äôs intent to ruin his life. Everything that mattered to Ryuji was taken away from him as a result of Kamoshida‚Äôs bullying/treatment towards him. Him having anger tantrums and constantly being loud is a result of him not receiving the psychological and emotional help that he needed from the same school system that crucified him for being physically assaulted and took away academic and financial opportunities from him. And another reason he is this way is because he wants to help people get out of their troubling circumstances and be happier/live better lives. You can see this reflected throughout every single character arc. So no, he is NOWHERE close to being an anime trope.
                    But you're not being closed-minded yourself when it comes to describing Makoto's defining trait as only exagerated intelligence?
                        Nope. She‚Äôs literally made as the voice of reason and as the leader when she first joins the party. Nothing closed minded about that. It‚Äôs the most defining characteristic that she has in the game. Take that away from her, and people wouldn‚Äôt like her as much as they do now.
                            So Makoto's arc and backstory never happened? I just think it's a bit ironic and biased for you to argue that there is more to Ryuji's character than what's in surface (which I agree with) then turn around and simplify another character.
                                It‚Äôs not simplifying at all. You‚Äôre acting like Makoto‚Äôs role in the entire game isn‚Äôt to be the intelligent leader. Before the party, she was established as the student council president. This translated especially when the team first accepted her as a member of the Phantom Thieves. She took over the planning and strategizing of everything. She doesn‚Äôt know how to separate her council president status from the group in the real world and in the metaverse. This is confirmed by her social link. She says that she wants to know what people like to do for fun. But yet she‚Äôll constantly criticize/ridicule ryuji for his laidback, goofy nature among the group. She doesn‚Äôt know how to not be serious. You don‚Äôt hear or see Ren say half of what she does when he is supposed to be the leader himself, guiding his team.
                                    That's her role and part of her character for sure, but that's not her entire character.  What I'm mainly pointing out in this discussion is that you saying that she's overrated because the most she has going for herself is her "exagerrated" intelligence and that's what people like about her when there are other aspects that people can gravitate to (like her responsible attitude, caring and helpful side, humbleness to admit her mistakes especially as a senior and student council president, etc.)

That's like saying Ryuji's entire role is the be the bro/comic relief of the group when while that is true, he has more to his character than that (just like you described). Just like you described that there is a reason why Ryuji acts the way he does, there's also a reason why Makoto acts the way she does. I'm mainly pointing out that it's a biased point of view to only selectively described a character to support your argument while you look at the whole picture for the other.
                    I think you misunderstood. I never said that he isn't a good character or anything. He is just quite over the top.
                        He is, but to me, it‚Äôs not fair to say that about him because of everything I mentioned. It‚Äôs not like he woke up and wanted to behave this way. There are major psychological reasons surrounding the way he acts sometimes.
    Oversimplifying things, in a date in real life, Makoto would be the most faithful and the one you can relate the most.

Ann and Haru are too high spec and would end up dating high spec dudes or celebrities. Yoshizawa would not have time to date since she is too obsessed with her career. And Futaba would feel more like your little sis.
        Lol you‚Äôre a usual makoto stan who sees their opinion as fact. I can relate to her, but she is definitely not a girl that I would date. Let alone befriend.
            >she is definitely not a girl that I would date. **Let alone** **befriend**.

Well, that explains everything. Just be straight and say you dislike her already.
                You‚Äôre right, I do dislike her. And her fan base. Has nothing to do with what I said previously though, Makoto Stan. No reason for me to sugarcoat anything. Lol.
                    I don't have a particular stan. I like all characters equally, but I picked Makoto as a waifu thinking like "if it was real life" thinking. I guess you can't see my logic since you dislike her, so you're opinion will be biased.
                        Except your ‚Äúreal life‚Äù thinking doesn‚Äôt define mine. Your sense of realism and mine are two completely different concepts filled with different expectations/standards. Don‚Äôt push your opinion as fact when it‚Äôll never come close to it. If I‚Äôm biased for having a difference of opinion about a video game character, you‚Äôre especially biased for being up Makoto‚Äôs butt to where you perceive her as an ideal person for everyone around you. Blocked. Push your obsession for her elsewhere.
Haru definitely deserves dead last. I don't have anything against her but she's just so . . . basic. . . compared to the rest of the cast.
    There are side characters that have more flavor. I wouldn't mind having Hifumi instead of her in my team. They probably thought we have already two smart ones.
        Oh totally. Hifumi, Tae, Sae, Iwai, Sojiro, Kawakami. All way more interesting than Haru.
            I think they wanted to have teens for your core team.
                I was just mentioning side characters that are more interesting than Haru, not characters I wanted in the party.
        Hifumi's just a worse Makoto what's the appeal to her?



If her confidant skills weren't so valuable, I'd written her off to Ohya tier.
            Even a "worse" Makoto is a better Haru. Also her SL is great. 10 Let's you swap characters on  other turns that means you don't lose one of Jokers turns. Also Ohya is good, imho the 3rd best adult woman in the game.
I‚Äôm honestly surprised that kasumi is rated third like is she good yes but i expected like 5th for her
where adacher???
    In the backrooms
I've recently finished the game and couldn't help but think Makoto should have been the main character. Glad others love her as much as I do.
Why do people like wet tissue personality Kasumi more than the infinitely more fleshed out and entertaining characters?? Kasumi acts like the biggest bitch i ever seen and i been to the dog house n back.
why tf is ryuji so low
it's funny because Makoto is the most bland phantom thief but yk funny Makoto guys!
id put protag, futaba, sumi, ryuji, haru as top 5 in no particular order then morgana akechi ann yusuke (no order) then Makoto
    She ranks 1st/2nd in other polls as well. I assume it is her design and how much she brings to the team.

1. Her biker chic aesthetic IS unique compared to the standard humanoid  persona. Throw in that her PT outfit is considered by many to be sexually arousing yet doesn't have the obvious problem of Ann costume and many fans don't feel uncomfortable appreciating her look


2. She is the most mature/normal of the group outside of Joker and is actually his sempai (notice that Makoto has to give her juniors explicit permission to drop the senpai when talking to her -only Haru and Yusuke this doesn't apply to


3. Even though she is the 6th PT and the 3rd to join, pretty much becomes the group 2nd in command by the 2nd time you hit the Bank palace and along with Joker is seen as the one responsible for the groups plans. Hell, even the game via giving her the Shadow Calculus and Shadow Factorization reinforce her tactiilcian role in the group
        she's so boring and her s-link is the worst in the game it's not even about her
    You complain about bland characters yet you would put joker in top 5 still. Ok
        joker represents your part in the story. he represents you and your journey throughout the game and what you learned after going through all of it.

and persona 5's story is very good with plenty themes and takeaways
            That speaks nothing for his character tho. Just how well you project yourself into his role 

He‚Äôs a deliberately flat character who exists for you to self insert. His character is carried by the personalities of the people he interacts with
                because you are the character
                    That‚Äôs my point
                        and you the self insert is a good character
                            Thats completely dumb reasoning. Joker has no personality of his own so you have make it yourself. Bland character gets carried by everyone else including the player
    I'm so agree with Makoto part. She's boring and condescending at times, but despite that everyone in team loves her and always ask for her opinion. Her social link isn't even about her, because it looks like she was meant to be Mary-Sue without the flaws (minus the comedy parts in P5 and Strikers where she's afraid of the ghosts, because even that paints her in the "cute way").
        Let's do some analysis:

Makoto is a very nice girl. She is smart, well adjusted, polite, a bit naive, strong, pretty, kind and has a very strong sense of justice...also she is a good strategist (even if they had to take that aspect from Hifumi and gave it to her)

But...

She is also extremely bland, boring, a bit of a stickler and not fun to hang around for long periods of time. She really not the type of person that lights up the room when she is there. A bit of a personal preference, but I appreciate characters that are "fun" to see, hear and just spend time with them. Even Ohya has more charisma than her.

Almost all the girls have different aspect she has PLUS being more fun or interesting than her in my opinion.
    Your downvotes are from the makoto defence force also I agree with your statement
strongly prefer ryuji and yusuke over futaba and kasumi
    I really just said bros before hoes but makoto can hang lmao
People actually like Morgana!? Is this poll voted by the real Persona 5 fans who never actually played the game?
    He‚Äôs always placed high. Mascots are popular and generally speaking he‚Äôs only unpopular in the west
        He is third last in an asian poll...
            incredible discussion as always on this subreddit
    Lmao he's the third least popular of the gang. I don't think very many people like him.
        I expected and wanted him last.
    I actually liked Morgana. He felt like the huge improvement over Teddy. It's much more surprising to me that people like Makoto so much, since she's such as party pooper and being praised all the time
        >huge improvement over Teddy

WHAT ?
            Yeah and I stand by this. Teddy is overly horny and that voice is difficult to hear for a long time. He had his moments (like drag pageant and persona awakening) but the overall horniness is tiring.
                And the constant bullying to Ryuji and simping for Ann is better!?
        Teddie is so much better.
        >He felt like the huge improvement over Teddy.

Slander.
It‚Äôs likely Joker shouldn‚Äôt be in this poll unless it includes other persona characters. It‚Äôs pointless if it‚Äôs a poll and the protagonist is the top. Plus Ann and Ryuji being low is likely that they didn‚Äôt get enough spotlight individually compared to those after them. Even Haru had more spotlight than them. Haru mainly cause she joined too late.
kinda amusing seeing Morgana outrank Ryuji, but I honestly find it sad seeing Sumi outrank most the cast when she barely exists, Haru is the only one I find completely fairly placed. I feel, like the rest of the cast deserves more popularity as they're better expanded and implemented
I‚Äôm new to the game and just cleared the third palace, does Makoto get better? I don‚Äôt really like her.
This is why the world is fucked.
How on earth is Ryuji below Morgana?? Morgana is the worrrrrrst
man... a LOT of players still simping for your "sister" huh...
How is Goro rated higher than Lady Ann, and Haru is rated last? There's no way people actually like Morgana and Ryuji more than Haru
    Putting aside our personal preferences...is it really surprising with how little screentime Haru gets?
        She neither smart like Makoto, Futuba and Goro so she can't give much good imput but she is also not as stupid as Ryuiji and give bad imput. So they rarely let her say stuff.
    Ryuji yea Morgana idk 50/50. 

Everyone‚Äôs love boner for Goro is getting old tho. Dude was a mass murderer I get it his childhood sucked but he‚Äôs literally no different than the other adults other than havin a body count
        Game ‚â† real life he‚Äôs still entertaining af
        He‚Äôs fun and his heel turn in the end is violent and jarring, which makes me like it even more. He‚Äôs basically Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde and his Mr. Hyde was out to play.
            You know he is pretty funni. Ok solid reason. Maybe not my fav but #5 might be about right, give or take a rank
        Eh, human life isnt that valuable. Did you not listen to shido-sans enlightening monologue. It was quite clear about this.
        I mean you can still like the characters and realize he should get punished for his crimes.
1-Silent protagonist 

2-Mary sue Mitsuru

3-Seconds Mary sue but plot relevant

Did i need to say more about what i think
    No thank you
        Welcome ü§ó
            The good ending
Makoto and Ryuji should switch places also Akechi and Haru
    Stay mad, the people have spoken, Makoto fans stay winning
        I'm a Makoto fan too, but "the people have spoken" is probably the worst reason to feel validated when it comes to opinions on fictional works.
My fav characters are in 1 and 2 so I'm happy
BASED POLL
Kawakami wasn‚Äôt an option?
Haru moment
I'm definitely disappointed to see Morgana higher than Ryuji, as well as a couple of others. 


Also damn, happy to see Makoto is that high!
Where the FUCK is Kawakemi
I actually love morgana and hate ryuji
Ryuji deserves better
Yusuke is so boring I can't stand for him being above Ryuji
The cat should be last
I agree mostly except 2 through 5 are reversed for me
Wow my top 5 would basically be this flipped except Futaba can stay in the top.
Is this poll only exclusive to Japan? Only Japanese would come up with such awful poll results.
    Western people when other people have different worldviews(they must be objectively wrong)
        I'm not from west but okay
            Ight
            He technically didn't say you were.
        This poll specifically shows some margin of bad taste though. Like, the silent protagonist in first place? Really? He barely has a personality and writing, and the competitions are a bunch of very solid characters.

I WILL judge people who's favorite character is the silent protagonist. No matter where they're from.
            Joker has more personality than the rest of the cast lmao. He may not say much but everything he says especially when he puts on the mask shows 10 times more than the rest of the cast
                That's just blatantly untrue when the rest of the cast gets full actual dialog to get fleshed out.
                    Writing =/= personality. They may be more "deep", but I'm not talking bout that
Ryuji should be number 1

Futaba 2

Morgana 3

Sumire 4

Everyone else equally 5-10 their positions don't matter to me
Oh come on, Makoto is honestly my second least favorite character.

Haru being at the bottom is totally understandable.
Aside from #1 this is completely fucked lol. Ryuji at the bottom somehow, Makoto understandably at the top but I don't like her so I'm salty, Morgana somehow above Ryuji, Yusuke isn't #0 because he's better than #1, like come on, guys, this is ridiculous.
I'm assuming this poll was region specific, since specific character rankings don't seem to fit with the consensus I always see people saying.

Examples;
Kasumi and Akechi are super hit and miss with people.

I've seen a LOT of people hate Morgana.

Haru got super popular after Atlas made her into a psychopath that has no filter.

Yusuke is preferred less than Ryuji.
    When did that with Haru happend? Not in Royal.
        in royal, she apparently comes up with an plan on how to kill shadows that even scares Morgana.

She also has a handful of dialogue while exploring where she mentions getting excited when killing enemies or when shadows beg for their lives amongst other things, and the other team members start getting afraid of her.

Then in the dancing game when Ryuji starts thinks about looking around her room she basically tells him if he doesn't stop she's going to kill him with a real axe she always keeps in her room.

Then in Scramble, she apparently makes a detective uncomfortable because she apparently repeatedly tells him she despises him and continues to insult him while keeping a cheerful tone and smile.

Also, everyone is afraid of her psychotic driving.
I feel like if Ryuji and Ann swapped genders, they would also swap positions on the poll. I find her more annoying and feel like she gets a pass over Ryuji for fanservice
Joker Makoto Ryujii Haru Yusuke Morgana Ann Akechi Futaba Kasumi

I love them all but I have my reasons.
So it's Joker, The Thing and the just like me fr trio
For real?! How did Ryuji get lower than all of these bongo brains. He at least shits on Anne
ok but makoto is annoying and kasumi and haru aren't around enough for proper character development, ryuji, yusuke, morgana and anne are all arguably pointless, protagonist and akechi only really have edginess going for them, and whoever i forgot is probably inconsequential, maybe i just haven't played in a long time, if i had played more recently i would probably have more bad takes, i should get new opinions considering how hated these probably are gonna be
I think the poll is all about looks. Joker isn't really a character.
Japanese have bad taste
    This is South East Asia poll, and no. You Westerners have bad tastes
there is a poll in overall persona series which accept anything and base with it on the internet and from what i saw Makoto is the least in the persona 5 girls in your team which is very suprising when i saw this well this is a official poll right so Makoto N. is very unpopular in unofficial poll?
futaba and haru>>>>>>>>>>> makoto is ok, but switching her and yusuke would make more sense
BULLSHIT! Morgana should be last! Ann should be above Makoto!
I am going to get downvoted for this and I'm sorry but Makoto is my least favorite phantom thief, I do no think she deserves 2nd place.
my faves being 9th & 10th lol u had to laugh
goro should be higher #gorosweep
Haru though I think she's incredibly cute has too little amount of time to get to know. No surprise she's on the bottom.
Repoll but replace every option with Morgana #MorganaSweep
Common Joker W
Can‚Äôt believe Futaba is so high up
I gotta ask, is Akechi very different in royal? I only played the normal version and although he isn‚Äôt a bad character I just don‚Äôt see how he is tis popular.
    Akechi gets an actual social link in Royal and comes back for the third semester >!where he's just full on psycho black mask while in the party which makes him hilarious.!<
    Mostly the same in the main story, but he gets a manual confidant until like rank 8 and a lot of scenes in the 3rd semester. I personally only really liked 1 rank from the new confidant, but I gotta say 3rd semester Akechi is quite good.
Yusuke‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶
    I'm not a huge fan of Yusuke, personally, but he's so underrated and I kinda fell bad for him. I think his first impression gives people a bad taste.
        This is a new development! I thought everyone loved yusuke!!
            Could be a case of faulty anecdotal evidence on my part.
Poor Haru
I don‚Äôt care who wins. I just want a certain SOMEONE to be in the bottom three, and I am satisfied 

(Note: it‚Äôs not Haru)
I was really confused until I see it's a poll from South Asia and so was "oh okay that's why Akechi is not higher"
How the fuck did my best boy Yusuke get 7th place?? That's a criminal offence, he deserves so much better :¬¥(
I see no yusuke fans ü•≤
How did Ryuji possibly rank *this* low...

Also am I the only one who finds it sad that the silent MC is the winner of a characters poll?
    "Alright!"
I refuse to believe Haru is lower in popularity than morgana....
My top would be kinda like this ...

Makoto

Futaba

My Boy Joker

Kasumi

Haru/Anne (tied for me)

Yusuke

Akechi

Morgana (His cat form is adorable tho. I didn't like his arc after >!Futaba's pyramid where he decided to ditch the Phantom Thieves over something extremely petty!< )

Ryuji (I'm sorry he's funny but his personality is loud and brash)
Not sure where I fit Kasumi. What I‚Äôd probably go with though.
They did my girl Haru wrong.
How is mf Ryuji that low?
Always knew Haru was a bottom üòà
Was this only polled in Japan?
    Yeah this poll came out in the SEA/Asia/Japan region
Ain‚Äôt no way morgana higher than ryuji
How the fuck is akechi in 5th? I hated that guy
It aint easy being a haru fan
Ryuji needs to be in at least 5th. Don‚Äôt see how a sadistic murderer is better than someone who comes up with the idea to combat social injustices, saving his friends and saving the world around him. And futaba has nothing going for her other than the genius hacker reputation and little sister vibes.
eh, akechi too high, haru too low
Wild to see the re-release character being ranked *so* highly. Marie was a pretty contentious character, and M√©tis was just‚Ä¶kinda forgotten.
My personal faves are 3, 2, and 6‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôm good with this list. ;)
Interesting‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt stand futaba or Akechi
I‚Äôm surprised Haru isn‚Äôt higher up. Although I‚Äôm very new to the fandom.


My personal favorites are Futaba, Yusuke, & Akechi.
Wtf no one (aside from Akechi) sacrificed like Ryuji and he is below Yusuke and Morgana??? Wtf did either of them ever do, Ryuji saves everyone and easily could have died.
Ryuji deserves better
All I have to say is‚Ä¶ eew.
Ryuji that low? *For real*?
Haru being dead last hurts me deeply
The cat should be in last place
I‚Äôm sure this is not going to result in any arguments whatsoever and any and all discourse surrounding the results of this poll will be completely respectful.
Shocked to see Ryuji so low. I'm only up to 6/19, admittedly, but he's by far my favorite character so far. 

At least I can be happy that my least favorite character is only one spot higher.
So many CBT simps over the blandest girl, yet the actual best girl got 10th?! This is an outrage!!!
Is Kasumi actually good to romance? Lot of people seem to like her.
For real?!
I dunno about this. Obviously, joker is my personal favorite but ryuji is 2nd for me.
how is MORGANA the fucking cat thingamajig higher than the loml ryuji sakamoto (no spoilers btw, im on saes palace)
No1 is surprised with Makoto being in top 3 tbh‚Ä¶
Haru is 10th!?
Kasumi Supremacy
RYUJI IS 9TH, THIS IS NOT FOR REAL
Poor Haru
Akechi should be higher
when are we not tbh
He's not really popular in Japan due to his vulgarity and informality about things sadly.
    To be honest, the English dub makes him a much more likeable character. He comes off like an ass in the Japanese track. I like the Japanese voice a lot, but his character there is much rougher around the edges.
        It‚Äôs not his fault his VA also voiced a deranged genius with a god complex holding a death note
    Are you kidding me? Miyano voiced him
    Like am not a big fan of him, didn't realize he wasn't liked over there.
        he‚Äôs just honest and doesn‚Äôt sugercoat anything that‚Äôs what i like about him. and he‚Äôs also a loveable idiot i find his japanese va hilarious
    As an Asian (not Japanese), i can confirm he is pretty annoying to me and my friends and we have no idea why Westerners love him so much

Louth-mouth people like loud-mouth characters?
        values varies between different cultures
        He's got a heart of gold and always has his friends' backs. He also happens to be a cutie pie.

He may be a loud idiot, but he's MY loud idiot.
            For me, he is like a combination of Kanji and Yosuke from persona 4
Tbf, we were before the poll too.
For real?!
More in shambles than law bro üíÄ
I think Max Mittelman's VA work elevates Ryuji a lot, so I get why he places so low on polls from Asia.

He's still best boy in my gay little heart
    The Japanese VA does a great job too! I like his character a lot even though I don't speak Japanese
        ^^^ this. i fell in love with Ryuji because of his JPN VA
            Ye mamoru miyano is op
                Based pfp
    I don't think that has anything to do with it since his JP va is fantastic too. His character just doesn't seem to appeal to them.
    Ryuji's voiced by Miyano Mamoru in Japanese, who is one of the most ridiculously talented seiyuu in the industry.  What you said has absolutely nothing to do with why he places low in polls. He places low in polls because he's kind of a stupid asshole in a game full of characters that *aren't* stupid assholes.
        at least he does the big think like once or twice at palace 4. haven't finished the game but god dam, i won't be surprised if Ryuji was the sole reason everyone got caught despite the multiple loose ends our lovable crew leaves behind
        [deleted]
            What? Why would that make him more relatable in the West? There are people like Ryuji absolutely everywhere.
well from what this poll shows it seems there aren‚Äôt many of you /j
‚Ä¶for real‚Ä¶
Deserve-
Temba, his arms wide.
At least we got one over haru
Haru fans were found dead in the ditch
FOR REEAAALL
He was always on the bottom half of all the polls I've seen.
That's what I'm saying.. I wonder why she's so low..like geez..
    Arc stolen by Morgana moment.
        Haru got fucked.


Like Naoto was the last character to join the party in P4 too but she was already investigating the case and had contact with the party for  months in advance and upon joining the party becomes more or less the most important member given she's smarter than the rest of them (though that's a low bar lol) and basically becomes Velma and solves the mystery for the gang.



Haru just comes out of nowhere, her arc is half stolen by Morgana and then doesn't add much to the party. As much as I love her, she's not important to the story, I'm glad Strikers at least gave her a spotlight for a bit.
            Naoto kinda takes charge of the whole investigation the moment she joins since she's a detective.

Haru brings nothing meaningful to the table when she joins. And P5 has a real problem keeping characters relevant past their initial chapter.
        And never gets focus after that, except a few moments during the Akechi thing in Shido's Palace.

And is a background character for half the story.

And her confidant unlocks the latest of all of them.

And PQ2 also ditches her.

Thr only game that gives her anything is Strikers and it's only one arc and a few scenes.
The main problem i think is that a lot people who played p5 only once also didn‚Äôt do her confidant, i think its pretty good. My favourite female character is makoto and haru‚Äô confidant is way better that hers ( not a hard thing to achieve) but unfortunately most people are already busy with the other confidants at that stage of the game.
    Another issue, from what I heard, is that unlike most of the other characters, she doesn't get much story. So on top of getting her so late, she also suffers from non-interesting story syndrome. Something that was slightly fixed in Strikers where she got her own dedicated and lengthy story.

Haru was going to be a potential romantic option in my first cycle because I liked her as a character in Strikers, but I chose Futaba as a first cycle romance option because of her being an introvert, a nerd, and honestly just seemed like me if I was a girl born in Japan given my rough history with my dad. Not nearly as bad as what happened to her but still sucks.
        Also by that point most people probably already decided on a partner that is unfortunately not yusuke, so haru suffers from that as well, sumire doesn‚Äôt suffer from this problem cause even tho she becomes a romance option wayyy later in the game she gets teased at the start of the game and you regularly talk to her when she was a normal person so people could hold out for her.
        That first point is a good one. Ryuji and Ann have the same problem but at least they join at the beginning and are vital/essential in the recruitment of the next two Phantom Thieves.

After the Spaceport Palace, there is the Casino Palace where it is a Akechi, Futaba and Makoto show.

Then next is the Cruiser arc where again, I'd argue it was a good showing by Makoto and Futaba (Futaba really does get a lot of story content doesn't she)

Haru...other than the interaction with the TV exec is kinda just there like Ryuji
            I mean they all, sans Haru unfortunately, have a story to themselves. Ryuji was an ex-track member booted out by Kamoshida, Ann was forced into sexual relations with said corrupt teacher, Yusuke was lied to by his mentor who plagiarized art. And so much more. Haru just... doesn't get a lot.

        Exact opposite for me, it weren‚Äôt ‚Äúrich problems‚Äù, it was about trusting people, she couldn‚Äôt trust anyone because everyone seemed to be after her wealth and to control her life by putting on fake smiles, I found that kind of relatable, trusting people is a gamble and haru had the worst odds but still she persevered and tried to control her own life and ultimately it paid of *spoilers* when it turned out that the new ceo the person she distrusted the most was actually the only guy that was trustable, her gamble paid off and showed about showing a little trust can go a long way.
Also Haru seems like the most boring girl in the entire game at face value
    I would give that to Makoto
        I love Makoto, but beep boop
            If I were to choose one to date, it would be Makoto since she seems to be the most faithful one. She's also willing to try and learn new things. She had a lot of fun playing in the game center. She's only boring if you are boring.
        Fuck you she has a bike (face value as in players perspective of course the other students don't know about Johanna)
            Bikes are cool but it doesn‚Äôt make up for how boring Makoto is.
                1 you are jealous, 2 she pegs Ryuji, 3 you are jealous over 2, 4 you are right
                    Most mentally sane Makoto fan
                        Nahh the only thing I enjoy about Makoto is the bike and Ryuji. Apart from Tae, I would stan 2/3rds of the male characters before I begin thinking about the girls
        I spat my drink
I find Haru's *character* likeable, but I think the (English) voice acting performance is awful, practically painful to listen to.  I'm not familiar with the actress so I won't speak to her ability in general, perhaps she just make an awkward choice for this role, but I find the performance jarringly bad to the point where it takes me out for a moment sometimes when I hear her.  The rest of the characters sound like characters having a conversation, then Haru breaks immersion by sounding like somebody reading from a script in a sound booth.

edit: to clarify I am referring to her English voice performance, not Japanese.
    Are you talking about the English dub? Because not only I've never heard her in it, I honestly couldn't care less.

This poll is either from Asia or worldwide (I found conflicting reports in the comments) so I imagine that's a non-factor as well. Most people outisde of English-speaking countries don't play with the English dub.

If you're talking about the Japanese voice, well then just agree to disagree, I really like Haruka Tomatsu's work with her.
        Yes, I am speaking of the English dub.  While I'm aware Persona has a global audience, as we're in the primarily-English Persona sub I assume that is typical of at a small majority of users here, though I am sure there are many like yourself who prefer to play with the Japanese dub.  As I do not speak Japanese, I do not, and I can only speak to my experience.
            But this thread is about an international poll and you're talking about the character's popularity based on a dub.

And honestly, even this sub has a lot of people with more strong opinions about the dub, I imagine like myself a lot tend to keep somewhat quiet because of how strongly dub fans tend to react to this kind of criticism.

You immediately jumped to the "I don't speak Japanese" crap like people who don't know English don't play translated games with the English dub (and if I got a penny every time I've seen native English speakers lash out or ridicule a foreign dub of an English-original property, let's just say I'd have a lot of pennies. But when people argue for original Japanese audio in Japanese games they're just le disgusting weeb right?)
                I was speaking of *my personal* reasoning for putting Haru last on the list.  Further, I acknowledged in my comment that others who don't speak Japanese often play without the English dub, only explaining that I do and gave my personal reasoning.  I did not call you, or anyone, a weeb, or disparage anyone's language choice in any way.  You're reading a lot into this that I did not say or imply, and I feel like this isn't about me but rather I am being projected onto. I am not others, and any issues you have with others does not feel right to pin onto me.
                    My apologies, I didn't mean to imply that all applied to you or to lash out. I was similarly trying to describe my experience dealing with native English-speaking fans, but somewhere alonge the way I got too caught up in the venting lol. Sorry.
                        Apology accepted, thank you.  Cheers.
Class rep is a trope of its own, too
Huh, never realized that....wonder if that is why Ann is just out of the top 5 as Kasumi is basically the Kouhai of Persona 5 now and thus invalidating Ann
    Ann isn't a kouhai though. She's the classmate archetype who sits next to the protag.
    ? she was never that archetype.
    what skipping cutscenes does to a man
        Nahh if anything bro only watches cutscenes
Not really. Protags are usually in shambles when talk is about harem animes. Ren took the W due to his showoff'ness and spectacular VA prolly
At least Joker has *some* of his own personality assigned to him beyond the self insert nature of his character.
    Too bad the anime and strikers did him no favours and made him the second most nothing character in the series, Boy with Earring still not beats him though
        Yeah, they did nothing with him in strikers thats true. I was just talking about the main game itself tho.

The persona animes are....... a thing you could watch. I dont personally put much weight in them. They can be fun but they clearly arent meant to make a lot of sense or be consistent. They are just fanservice. Just look at the first scene in the P4 anime where Yu gets his persona...
            They made both Makoto and Yu interesting characters, so I give them props for that
                Sure but they also made Yu nuke like 700 shadows into oblivion the second he got his persona.

The anime are for-fun fanservice as i see them, instead of serious additions to the characters writing or the plot.
                    That was for the Golden anime which was specifically supposed to emulate a new game plus run and show off the new stuff for P4 Golden

The original p4 anime he fights just 2 and it's a bit of a struggle as it show the original journey through P4.
                        Oh okay, ill have to check out the regular P4 anime.

I genuinely thought the golden one was all there was for 4.
                            Nah there‚Äôs a 20+ episode series that really gives Yu a character all his own and shows how he brings out the best in his team.

It also shows Yu‚Äôs shadow and his crippling abandonment issues
                                Hmm. That sounds really good compared to the 4G and 5 ones.
                            The Vanilla P4 anime is amazing.  Highly recommend.
Yeah but he looks cool AND you make him cool based on the dialogue choices. You kind of HAVE to like Joker
    Joker is my third least party member favourite character in the franchise, I‚Äôd take Ayase over Ren any day
        My bad, guess I just really like his design
            His design if fine, good even, but a character is more than their artwork 

The only characters I like less than him are Boy-With-Earring as he‚Äôs even less of a character than Ren, and Yukari who is the only character to actively piss me off with her attitude and actions.

I can‚Äôt like Ren as a character because there is no character there to like.
                Yeah I get that, self inserts are difficult to put a personality onto but I'm big on making the character mine so they always have a consistent character rather than whatever I find funny. It really is just up to how you play games
                    The issue is that not only have they given both Makoto and Yu personality in other works, they are good personalities that elevate the interactions and connections with the other characters 

In regards to Ren however they have gon on record and said said giving him personality limits what they can do with him, which is nonsense as him not being allowed to have personality is even more limiting in how scenes can play out, and feels like they are desperate not to say ‚Äúso that the player/watcher can pretend to have friends or a girlfriend‚Äù
                        Yeah, I do agree but self inserts are personal preference
                            I find they only work when you have a significant amount of dialogue options, very frequently. For example Dragon Age: Origins, Divinity Original Sin 2, or Knights of the old Republic 2.

The way Persona handles it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhow do you want to react to this‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äústoic, sarcastic, or goofy, pick one‚Äù it just feels lazy and jarring to have so little come from the main character who interacts with so many well written characters
                                I see your point. I haven't played origins, but I have played Inquisition, and there are lots of dialogue choices, and they definitely have a bigger impact compared to persona 5. They also give you ways to actually build a coherent character with some nuance, like how it's tracks your position on being the Herald of Andraste and religion. I guess I just didn't expect much depth going into Persona 5 and focused on who looked cool. I had heard before playing that the story was kinda shallow, so I guess I focused on who looked coolest

Is this a Chainsaw man reference or‚Ä¶.
    Perhaps....
How come?
    People don‚Äôt like that same things as we do in the west.
    basically asia has bias for cute and smart characters
        [deleted]
    Japanese players love their silent protags.
I'm actually surprised Akechi didn't come second, he's pretty popular in Japan.
Ridiculous xD
She is \#1. From the bottom.
I don't see how she is.
Probably because he is a self insert and I've noticed that self insert characters are VERY popular, much more so than in N.America

Kirito of SAO is widely mocked and hated here in the west as being one of the most blatantly bad examples of a Gary Stu. 

Yet his popularity in Japan pretty much brought to the forefront the self insert overpowered, harem collecting isekai.genre we have now

It isn't that we in the west don't do Gary stun(see Harry Potter) but I don't think we are as explicitly blatant.

There's also the fact that Joker does have a personality based on the anime (slight that it is) and I imagine anyone responding to a Persona 5 poll in SEA is also familiar with the anime and that undoubtedly has an effect on their perception of Joker
    I‚Äôd argue he has a little bit of personality in the game, not much but there is something. Also things like his phantom thief outfit may be a factor as well.
    Harry Potter is not a Gary Stu, he sucks so bad at so many things; half of the books felt like him luckily stumbling through the obstacles more than anything else. I was always annoyed at how he sucked at things when I read the books while I was younger. He‚Äôs more of a brave idiot than anything else.
        Yeah the only thing he was the best at was combat. He was the best duelist in his batch and that's it
He's only one spot above Ryuji tbf...
Japan really doesn't like ryuji because he's a delinquent who rebels against authority, in a game about rebelling against authority
    Yet they have no qualms against the rebel leader and a cyber terrorist. I think it's just because Ryuji is loud, obnoxious, and--I say this with love--dangerously stupid at times.
        I guess Junpei or Yosuke weren't very well received then since they are at least two of those - possibly all three. Haven't played 3 but I imagine Junpei is among the first people the protag meets and among the first that gets his Persona.
            Japan respects intelligence and in the games I‚Äôve played (3-5) I feel like Yosuke is one of the most intelligent party members you get. Sure he isn‚Äôt book smart but he really sets the pace and leads the investigation until Naoto joins. Most of the progress they make comes from Yosuke and he‚Äôs kind of the stand-in for the silent protagonist in terms of deductions and abstract thinking.
            Yosuke feels much more different than Ryuji. I think they went too far with the loud and dumb personality of Ryuji in the main story, he's like some caricature. Yosuke is more like a normal highschooler and is extremely popular in Japan.
                I dunno. Ryuji is more endearing than anything. Mostly because I do enjoy more slapstick goofy characters with a badass streak, Yosuke is in that league too by the way - by way of just being the butt monkey of the Investigation Team along with Teddie and sometimes Kanji.
                    I think the difference is that Yosuke is responsible (he has a job), smart, and not as loud and as aggressive as Ryuji.
            Er no. The loud, physical, dumbass rough and tumble character of the Investigative Team is Chie (she is the Strength Arcana for a reason)

Junpei IS of the Strength Arcana but I would never consider him the rebel, delinquent of the SEES team
                Strength? Weren't they Chariots?
                    Junpei is Magician
                        Oh right, my bad.
                    Whoops...yeah I meant Chariot.

 I am a little bit disappointed that people. constantly equate Yosuke with Jumpei and Ryuji when Chie is RIGHT THERE

It isn't like Chie joins the game at the end like Haru.....
                        It's because Yosuke plays the role of the best friend from the start so people will most likely draw parallels with characters who play a similar role (but then it should be Yukari instead of Junpei lol, she feels much more like a bro than him).

Though ngl, my big reason for not associating Yosuke with Ryuji unless I'm making a comparison that's favorable to Ryuji is because he's wholesome while Yosuke is homophobic (and being bi... I just cannot bring myself to like a homophobic character).
                            Yosuke was originally designed to be bi as well, which is where the internalized homophobia comes from. Since they cut the romance he ends up just seeming like an asshole but he does grow and towards the end of the game I feel like he genuinely accepts Kanji and gets over his prejudice.
                            I actually agree with you. Female protagonist of persona 3, yes, Junpei is her best friend among the SEES team

But regular male protag? I NEVER got the impression they were friends much less best friends. Yukari, yeah I'm there with you

Which furthermore drives me up a wall when those 3 get equated. The only commonality between the three is that they are the first person to join your party
                                And not even that, in fact, as I'm pretty sure Yukari joined before Junpei in 3 lmao. They're just the first dudes.
            Nah I've seen Yosuke quite high up on these polls
    I‚Äôm Asian, but not Japanese. We generally don‚Äôt like Ryuji because he‚Äôs rude and annoying. We don‚Äôt like muscle-bound idiots
    It's more like Japan and East Asia don't like dumb people.
Haru has NPC energy.
    out of everybody in the cast, i honestly thought she had the most potential to be black mask.
It really isn‚Äôt.

Mascots and cats are well liked by people in regions.

Also if one bothered to pay attention to detail and nuance in character writing then Morgana is solid with what his character and story is all about.

There‚Äôs a lot to discuss.

Ryuji as good as he is, is a simple straightforward character where there‚Äôs not a lot of discussion surrounding him compared to the rest.
    My favorite kinds of people are people from regions
    I think morgana is one of the better written ones among the phantom thieves, if he had an actual confidant it would have been even better. But people just blindly hate on the superficial aspects and completely ignore his internal struggles,these are the same people who run away from a problem/equation rather than trying to understand it.
        Personally I think his confidant worked out being main story as it acknowledges plot events. Plus there‚Äôs his endgame role.

Considering that Mona is mostly with us 24/7, can‚Äôt exactly see him as a manual confidant.
            Yeah, might have had the opposite effect and make people even more mad. I personally would have loved one, a confidant which explores insecurity and fear of losing a home. Or they could have done it like the twins and have 2 ways of interaction.
                His existing confidant already kinda hints at that though. 

Like the times he confides in Joker, you can sense the insecurity he has building up till it boils around the Okumura arc.

I assume you wanted more via access to a manual one so it adds more layers on top of the existing main story scenes?
                    Yup thats right, and if you do all of that you get special scenes with morgana at the end of the story,  like how you get extra dialogue from lavenza about her love if you do all the twin requests. most confidants explore one topic like ryuji with moving on, yusuke and motivation etc.., insecurity is a much bigger and interesting topic that i would love to be shown in depth with morgana.
        Imo his character is also written really cleverly in regards to his Arcana as well

The Magician represents the concept of ‚Äúas above, so below‚Äù‚Äî meaning heaven and earth reflect each other, microcosms and macrocosms reflect each other, the ‚Äúinner world‚Äù of the self and the ‚Äúouter world‚Äù reflect each other, etc. In Persona, the Metaverse and reality reflect each other. The Magician additionally represents the  ability to travel between these two worlds, just like how Morgana acts as the Thieves‚Äô guide to the Metaverse.

The Magician Arcana can also represent someone ‚Äúcoming into their own‚Äù, just like how Morgana finds his place in the world and among the Phantom Thieves despite his insecurities.
        I‚Äôm in a weird spot for Morgana because I agree he has some depth with his internal struggles about who he is and where he came from BUT I can not stand the him ditching the phantom thieves. I was so annoyed with that entire arc and it easily my least favorite part every time I play.

It also just annoys me from a story writing perspective because it robbed Haru of her story but that‚Äôs off subject.
    Also if one bothered to pfbtbthbfht
    I agree, I don‚Äôt really get the hate for Morgana on this sub. I felt pretty indifferent towards him during my first playthrough, he was just the cute cat character that was annoying sometimes. 

Ryuji on the other hand is downright one of the worst main cast Persona characters imo. He won‚Äôt shut the fuck up about booba and how much he deserves money, chicks, and power just because he‚Äôs a phantom thief. They nearly get caught because of his ego/stupidity and he still screams about being a thief in public because ‚Äúlulz that‚Äôs just how real teenagers act xDD‚Äù. Literally none of the other characters act half as stupid. He was great for the first 10 hours of the game and then dove straight to rock bottom in terms of character development.
        Don‚Äôt exactly agree there with your assessment of Ryuji.

Him acting like that is very much the point of his main story character arc where he has to develop from his flaws of being an immature glory seeker that wants to be a famous hero that gets rewarded and acknowledged to make up for how much of a loser he is in the real world. As well as being someone who doesn‚Äôt see the value and appeal of being ‚ÄúA Hero that lurks in the shadows‚Äù as opposed to those in the limelight.

He actually does develop past that mindset post Okumura arc with their downfall giving him a wake up call and humbling him.

I disagree with the notion that teenagers wouldn‚Äôt act like him. Mishima with drunk on power he was and insecure about being a ‚Äúzero‚Äù is not that different from Ryuji‚Äôs attitude.

Any immature teenager that is a loser with nothing big going on for them in life naturally would take having superpowers with real gusto.

Reason why the other Thieves aren‚Äôt like that is because they have some silver lining in the real world which isn‚Äôt like your typical teenager (barring Morgana who has it worse due to no memories or identity):

Ann is a successful model, Makoto is student council president and honour student, Yusuke is an aspiring artist, Futaba is a hacking prodigy that was the founder of a hacking vigilante organisation, Akechi is the 2nd coming of the detective prince and Kasumi is a talented gymnast. 

Joker can make something of himself in the real world due to the player.
            I also want to add that the only reason why Ryuji has nothing going on for him in the real world is that Kamoshida fucked up his knee. If not for that, he would be a successful runner. That would be his "silver lining".
                Yep. Nice follow up.

Ryuji‚Äôs story of having a career ending injury is similar to Anna Yoshizaka from Persona 2.
            I mean, sure losers can aspire to have power because they don't have anything in the real world. But Joker is on probation and nearly risked losing his entire livelihood because of Ryuji's stupid mistakes/inability to control himself. And while Ryuji was very well aware of Joker's situation, his desire for attention took precedence over the safety of his own supposed "best friend". My point is that the whole theme and motif of the Phantom Thieves is that they work anonymously because there are legitimate real-world consequences they must face if their identities are revealed. They reject the status-quo of society and manifest their own brand of justice by their own means, whether it's right or wrong. They are NOT superheroes. Nearly every character related to the Phantom Thieves, sans Ryuji and Mishima, is aware of this fact. I'm not a fan of writing a character as a complete dumbass with zero common sense for the sake of trying to portray an inferiority/hero complex.

Admittedly I'm only halfway through my second playthrough after years of playing vanilla P5, but I don't recall Ryuji drastically improving after the Okumura arc. From what I recall, he was almost like an entirely different person during his social link vs the main story. Yes, Okamura was Ryuji's lowest point as a character. But he doesn't really do anything to make up for it afterward or have any redeeming qualities to his character post-Kamoshida that make him endearing to me.
Personally Ryuji is probably my most disliked out of the Phantom Thieves. He just gets on my nerves idk. I love Yusuke though lol, he's my best boy
    Ryuji used to piss me off during my first playthrough because he was constantly shouting **HEY EVERYBODY WE'RE THE PHANTOM THIEVES!** To everyone in a 20 kilometer radius.

That being said, I've replayed the game many times and he really grew on me. Haru is still best girl though and it's a travesty that she isn't ranked higher.
        >constantly shouting **HEY EVERYONE WE'RE THE PHANTOM THIEVES!** To everyone in a 20 kilometer radius

Tbf, they are a group of 16 year-olds. That's the most realistic thing in the entire game
            16 year olds are not that dumb, ryuji is just mentally 5
                I don‚Äôt mean to generalize, but I‚Äôve seen 16 year olds do way dumber things than Ryuji, so it‚Äôs not that unrealistic
    My man!! Yusuke,akechi and maruki are my holy trinity of persona 5 characters.
The problem Haru has is that she's really more of a P5S character with a P5/P5R cameo
I like Morgana and Ryuji about equally and I prefer Morgana to Haru (she just doesn't get enough screentime for me to get attached)
Well considering that its Asian poll it makes more sense. His Jap VA is MUCH less unbearable
Morgana isn't as awful as Teddy from 4 but he is trying.
Imo, despite being the silent type of protagonist, you can see glimpses of his personality in the answer options. He embodies many traits that people look up to, (as well as giving ppl the opportunity to project themselves onto him, that's true).
    I do totally understand that Joker has character, his bond with Akechi despite the players actual feelings being a core trait. I just find it kinda disappointing that most people choose the self-insert over the actual characters.

Joker definitely deserves a good ranking for the personality shown in answer choices and his unique personas (arsene etc), but not necessarily first place.
        Oh, when you put it that way, I agree.
I mean it's game over if he goes down, he's obviously the most important.
Ryuji can take the L in stride. The boy has been through worse.
Disagree
In the same place with Demifiend
 They hid him to avoid public panic ü§Øü§Øü§Ø.
It's not a poll made in Japan or US, so that's why
This poll only covered Southeast Asia.
Shes cool and I like how assertive she is
    I just kinda feel like they made every other character stupider when she joined to make her look smart by comparison when she never really does anything smart or has good plans or anything.

She looks cool and I enjoy the angry overachiever archetype but I just feel she‚Äôs a bad example of it.
        I don't see it personally as neither Ryuji or Ann's characterizations really made them out to be gifted academically, Yusuke is solely focused on his art, Joker's a blank slate self insert, and all of Morgana's knowledge is specialized and related to palaces/personas. Makoto showing up and having a slight edge on her classmates intellectually doesn't bother me as she's both a year older and presented as a student who's focused on her academic career. If they made her out to be some kind of super genius prodigy with a towering intellect then I'd be more inclined to agree with you and call her unrealistic but instead she comes across as a well read teenager with booksmarts but no street smarts.

Makoto is the reliable party member who outside of Joker deals most with Akechi, sometimes acting like a liason. She reviews and provides more input on plans outlines than the others and the whole heist on Sae's Palace sees her heavily involved with the preparation of the baits and switches. She does a decent amount of heavy lifting in her own right, I think people just lose sight of that because she's less outwardly wacky than all the others. Her dumb decisions mostly stem from hubris and naivetey rather than actual idiocy so for all of that I think she's consistent and believable as a smarter than average teenager.

I still respect your opinion though
            My only problem with Makoto's intelligence is when she does really stupid shit and it's treated as though she's being smart.

Like we find one of Kaneshiro's men and instead of trying to extract information or tail him we get this:

Makoto: Hello there suspicious looking hooligan. Are you selling illegal substances by chance? 

Makoto: I think that guy was part of the Mafia...

That's some Ryuji level subtly there...
                Or to make Makoto look smart she becomes semi omnipotent.

Like I just passed the Okumura section and when Futaba explains the Phan site had been hacked Makoto says something like:

"Well obviously then we were set up to take down Okumura by the cause of the mental shutdowns and they know who we are."

There's more possible explanations than that. The Phantom theifs are household names right then and not just the villians wanted Okumura to have a change of hearts. But Makoto is "smart" so she gets to skip all the incorrect possibilities so she can be correct.
                    I mean... it's a suggestion? It's not like she 100% knew it. She dropped a hypothesis to consider.
                        My problem is that the hypothesis was flawless at the time. Theoretically, the character wouldn't know they're correct, but hindsight shows it was pretty much perfect.

It's not really the only time, just the one that most took me out of the moment.

Her suspecting you as Phantom Theifs because you had problems with Komoshida. The whole volleyball team had an issue with him. christ, he raped a girl, there's quite a few people who'd want to get him.

She perfectly gets to Kaneshiro by demanding some random thugs take her there. Somehow, it works flawlessly, and she doesn't have something worse than a threat happen to her.

She gets into Kaneshiro's palace, having been in the metaverse for 5 minutes.

Hope I'm not coming off as rude or dismissive. This was my thought process during the game, these could absolutely be problematic to me and not you, just wanted to share something I saw as a flaw during my playthrough.
                            Idk, I really don't feel like it's that farfetched or crazy of a hypothesis to make. All of the thieves have constantly been saying "things have been going too smoothly" to indicate how they think there's a possibility all of it is scripted. They know that there's a third party involved because of the black mask too. The hypothesis makes sense imo.

Also, while there are others who hate Kamoshida, you're the only one who had an actual vocal problem about him. Everyone suffering keeps quiet, and those that don't suffer are ignorant usually. Plus, you arrive at the school, and in the span of a month you start beefing with him, he's about to expel you and he confesses to his crimes on the day that you're supposed to get expelled. The coincidences are too great to not suspect Joker and his crew tbh.

The Kaneshiro situation is just dumb luck though. Sure it was "the correct play" in hindsight, but everyone agreed that it was a stupid thing to do and out of character. She even feels bad about it and apologizes. Maybe you can argue they got off too easily, but that's a different issue than Makoto at that point.

Idk, I just never really felt like she was being too big brained in the main story.
                I thought that was the point honestly? Like her being book smart but not actually good at "in the moment" smart.
                    See that's a fine flaw to have--but she's treated as if she's being intelligent in the moment, when she's really not.
                        You're the only person there though, you can decide if you want to praise her or not.

Plus she says some dumbass shit like "he was dodging all my traps", like there's no way they wanted you to take her seriously. It just shows how she doesn't really get how people work.
                            I'll have to double check, but didn't both of Joker's options say that he was impressed or something to that effect?
                                You can do that in some cases, but the rest of the team immediately shames you for not praising the Queen. It's like every reaction but praise is a crime
                                Well yeah, two of them. But aren't there three? So just don't go for that option and she doesn't get praised.
                She addresses that herself though, stating she messed up by being too desperate to be useful to someone.  It‚Äôs a trait of hers that she learned to overcome.  Unlike say, Ryuji who remains pretty dumb and loud throughout the story.
I really really like Morgana tbh
In a poll only covering one part of Asia. Ryuji still the better party member
Yeah kinda surprised to see Joker first (not surprised that he's in the top 3 but first ?)

Like yeah I get it he's the protagonist but the whole point is that he has almost no personality outside player input and rarely speaks unlike a Cloud or a Kiryu

It's just kinda weird for him to be anyone's favorite character but hey I ain't judging
    I think its because blank slate characters are easiest to latch onto. The lack of any voice acting makes it so you can give him any tone while choosing responses. That's my logic anyway, I tend to make him the reasonable authority between the outgoing Ryuji, the cocky cat thief Morgana, and the sweet but sometimes whiny Ann (no hate to her, I love her too). Who are the closest friends to the protag compared to the characters coming later, since the four of them went through the most palaces together (Kamoshida onward).
I see you‚Äôre a fellow Ann enjoyer.
    Yesss I love her character. The way she own her personality and beauty is really inspiring. Also the feeling of being different somewhere where being different is frowned upon is really relatable.
        And her romantic interactions are so cute ü•∞
            I haven't seen them cause I usually don't go to any romance routes. I mean...persona is really limiting for a gay guy but the bro hang outs are cool enough. Ann always felt like that first girl bff you make that you share your spicy life stories with I we a fun sleepover lmao.
Joker shows more personality in the times he does speak than entirety of the cast though. Not bashing rest of the cast, but his VA is too good
Protagonists are almost always the most popular characters in asian polls.
    Interesting, I wasn\`t aware of that.
    >Protagonists are almost always the most popular characters in asian polls.  


Yeah when they are not silent, Aigis & Yosuke were top 1 in asian poll, yu and makoto (p3) were not even top 5 in p3 & p4 poll
        The ones that i found had them pretty high up though..

it really annoys me how obsessed people are with him tbh he legit murdered countless people
    "He mUrDeREd CoUNtlEsS PeOpLe"

Man you wouldn't survive playing Shin Megami Tensei LMAO
        Im always surprised why people like this can't appreciate a good villain in a story, millions of people love Darth Vader because of what he brings to the story but we're suppose to hate him because he killed loads of people is stupid.
            Same, sincerely Akechi isn't even the worse villain in a JRPG, and he's actually vanilla like AF compared with the other personas

The most interesting character in P5 for sure is him, so I don't get who think that people can't actually understand he's not right in his choices and still like this character

Like I said, wouldn't survive playing a SMT game
                never said he was the worst character, simply stated idk why people love him sm when hes a mass murderer. you‚Äôve further proved my point
                    Because he's well written lmao also no one needs a reason to like a character, I can't understand who likes Yusuke or Haru too much either, but who cares? Why you like or not a character is a matter of personal taste

I like characters that are complex more than simple juvenile ones, that's why ¬Ø‚Å†\‚Å†_‚Å†(‚Å†„ÉÑ‚Å†)‚Å†_‚Å†/‚Å†¬Ø

But sincerely if I give my real opinion about P5 this sub will ban me
        i would survive them, i just wouldnt be chill with the serial killer characters, sorry if that triggers u
Kasumi is the worst written character in the entire series
    Responded to a 3 month old comment whilst dropping a horrible take. Yikes.
        A dismal take
You didn‚Äôt know yusuke had a fan base? Are you fucking serious?
Based
I have a soft spot for characters who are dumb and rowdy but surprisingly emotionally intelligent, I guess.
    I think you mean emotionally assertive. He's able recognize and display his own emotions, thoughts, and feelings to those around him. He's open and honest with the way he feels at all times and he isn't afraid to hide himself.   


While this is a good character trait for him because it helps better show off the simplicity in his nature, it is indirectly different from emotional intelligence, which would be more like understanding how others feel.
    >Ryuji


>emotionally intelligent

Pick one
    >surprisingly emotionally intelligent

Doubt.

Did you see his spat with Morgana, or when he made fun of Ann crying over him?
        [deleted]
            I have seen this before but I don't get the tantrum argument. From basically the start of his social rank, Morgana has been unsure about his place in the world

An emotionally intelligent person like Haru can pick up on this and not target those insecurities...and what does Ryuji do?
                You don't even need to be emotionally intelligent. Even Futaba knew Ryuji was fucking up big time.
            You mean when Ryuji kept pushing Morgana's buttons despite him clearly being upset about it, and then made a half-assed apology, then yes. 

They were both insufferable. Ryuji isn't as emotionally intelligent as people like to claim him as lol.
Same. His constant anger issues and screaming are annoying af. So many situation would've been resolved easier if he just stayed silent. Also his boner for popularity was lowkey annoying too. I don't need to mention him being an ass towards morgana
    To be fair about the Morgana part, he literally just attacked Ryuji upon first meeting him and hasn't stopped being mean to him since, even in battle. *Of course* Ryuji would fight back, being a teenager (and a more abrasive one at that).
Isn't Makoto's tendency to lose her temper a big hang up? And her "no bullshit" attitude? I know it's a meme but she's not actually a robot. Her character is just a more grounded one in a game full of anime tropes and moments, so she just isn't as attention grabbing on-screen as other characters.
Dude, the majority of her appeal as a waifu is that she would be the most faithful one and the one who needs help the most in "discovering" the world and trying new things. Plus she seems to like gaming which is a great plus. Realistically speaking, she's the perfect package for a good wife.

Futaba also needs help, but at the end of her confidant level she becomes independent. And like you said, many people see her more like a little sis. She would come second after Makoto for me though.

Ann and Haru are basically independent strong girls who are out of league for most people in real life. They would end up dating celebrities or high spec dudes in the future.

I'm finishing Royal now, but I didn't get to see full Yoshizawa yet, but she also seems to be immersed in her athlete career and gives the vibe of not having too much time to spend on other things that is unrelated to her career.
It's probably about looks and projection.
Wasn't she specifically made to be the ideal Japanese woman?
    She's the ideal woman period. Ann may be the lovers arcana but atlus never misses the chance to tell us "hey check out these two nerds! Aren't they cute together?"
I don‚Äôt hate him, but slowly finding him overrated the more time I spent in this subreddit. I don‚Äôt get why people like him over Yusuke and Morgana
    Agree. I do get that he's a good guy, but sometimes he's completely insufferable
Ryuji, bashful? Eccentric?

Do you mean brash?
    Ryuji: Bold and Brash
Yes we need this
She's literally the only character that isn't an overblown anime trope.
    Lol no. Ryuji is arguably the most realistic out of all of them.
        Bruh what he's literally a delinquant that yells 24/7. That's pretty damn overblown.
            If you‚Äôre closed minded and don‚Äôt read between the lines, yeah. The circumstances that lead up to him being a delinquent is part of why and how he came up with the idea of everyone becoming PTs. He was verbally and physically abused as a child by his father and by his PE teacher. As a result of Kamoshida‚Äôs comments about his mother, he lost his temper which made him lose his track scholarship to help take care of his mother. When he needed emotional support/guidance throughout the situation, his peers and teachers crucified and blamed him for the entire situation. He was essentially gaslighted for defending himself against Kamoshida‚Äôs intent to ruin his life. Everything that mattered to Ryuji was taken away from him as a result of Kamoshida‚Äôs bullying/treatment towards him. Him having anger tantrums and constantly being loud is a result of him not receiving the psychological and emotional help that he needed from the same school system that crucified him for being physically assaulted and took away academic and financial opportunities from him. And another reason he is this way is because he wants to help people get out of their troubling circumstances and be happier/live better lives. You can see this reflected throughout every single character arc. So no, he is NOWHERE close to being an anime trope.
                But you're not being closed-minded yourself when it comes to describing Makoto's defining trait as only exagerated intelligence?
                    Nope. She‚Äôs literally made as the voice of reason and as the leader when she first joins the party. Nothing closed minded about that. It‚Äôs the most defining characteristic that she has in the game. Take that away from her, and people wouldn‚Äôt like her as much as they do now.
                        So Makoto's arc and backstory never happened? I just think it's a bit ironic and biased for you to argue that there is more to Ryuji's character than what's in surface (which I agree with) then turn around and simplify another character.
                            It‚Äôs not simplifying at all. You‚Äôre acting like Makoto‚Äôs role in the entire game isn‚Äôt to be the intelligent leader. Before the party, she was established as the student council president. This translated especially when the team first accepted her as a member of the Phantom Thieves. She took over the planning and strategizing of everything. She doesn‚Äôt know how to separate her council president status from the group in the real world and in the metaverse. This is confirmed by her social link. She says that she wants to know what people like to do for fun. But yet she‚Äôll constantly criticize/ridicule ryuji for his laidback, goofy nature among the group. She doesn‚Äôt know how to not be serious. You don‚Äôt hear or see Ren say half of what she does when he is supposed to be the leader himself, guiding his team.
                                That's her role and part of her character for sure, but that's not her entire character.  What I'm mainly pointing out in this discussion is that you saying that she's overrated because the most she has going for herself is her "exagerrated" intelligence and that's what people like about her when there are other aspects that people can gravitate to (like her responsible attitude, caring and helpful side, humbleness to admit her mistakes especially as a senior and student council president, etc.)

That's like saying Ryuji's entire role is the be the bro/comic relief of the group when while that is true, he has more to his character than that (just like you described). Just like you described that there is a reason why Ryuji acts the way he does, there's also a reason why Makoto acts the way she does. I'm mainly pointing out that it's a biased point of view to only selectively described a character to support your argument while you look at the whole picture for the other.
                I think you misunderstood. I never said that he isn't a good character or anything. He is just quite over the top.
                    He is, but to me, it‚Äôs not fair to say that about him because of everything I mentioned. It‚Äôs not like he woke up and wanted to behave this way. There are major psychological reasons surrounding the way he acts sometimes.
Oversimplifying things, in a date in real life, Makoto would be the most faithful and the one you can relate the most.

Ann and Haru are too high spec and would end up dating high spec dudes or celebrities. Yoshizawa would not have time to date since she is too obsessed with her career. And Futaba would feel more like your little sis.
    Lol you‚Äôre a usual makoto stan who sees their opinion as fact. I can relate to her, but she is definitely not a girl that I would date. Let alone befriend.
        >she is definitely not a girl that I would date. **Let alone** **befriend**.

Well, that explains everything. Just be straight and say you dislike her already.
            You‚Äôre right, I do dislike her. And her fan base. Has nothing to do with what I said previously though, Makoto Stan. No reason for me to sugarcoat anything. Lol.
                I don't have a particular stan. I like all characters equally, but I picked Makoto as a waifu thinking like "if it was real life" thinking. I guess you can't see my logic since you dislike her, so you're opinion will be biased.
                    Except your ‚Äúreal life‚Äù thinking doesn‚Äôt define mine. Your sense of realism and mine are two completely different concepts filled with different expectations/standards. Don‚Äôt push your opinion as fact when it‚Äôll never come close to it. If I‚Äôm biased for having a difference of opinion about a video game character, you‚Äôre especially biased for being up Makoto‚Äôs butt to where you perceive her as an ideal person for everyone around you. Blocked. Push your obsession for her elsewhere.
There are side characters that have more flavor. I wouldn't mind having Hifumi instead of her in my team. They probably thought we have already two smart ones.
    Oh totally. Hifumi, Tae, Sae, Iwai, Sojiro, Kawakami. All way more interesting than Haru.
        I think they wanted to have teens for your core team.
            I was just mentioning side characters that are more interesting than Haru, not characters I wanted in the party.
    Hifumi's just a worse Makoto what's the appeal to her?



If her confidant skills weren't so valuable, I'd written her off to Ohya tier.
        Even a "worse" Makoto is a better Haru. Also her SL is great. 10 Let's you swap characters on  other turns that means you don't lose one of Jokers turns. Also Ohya is good, imho the 3rd best adult woman in the game.
In the backrooms
She ranks 1st/2nd in other polls as well. I assume it is her design and how much she brings to the team.

1. Her biker chic aesthetic IS unique compared to the standard humanoid  persona. Throw in that her PT outfit is considered by many to be sexually arousing yet doesn't have the obvious problem of Ann costume and many fans don't feel uncomfortable appreciating her look


2. She is the most mature/normal of the group outside of Joker and is actually his sempai (notice that Makoto has to give her juniors explicit permission to drop the senpai when talking to her -only Haru and Yusuke this doesn't apply to


3. Even though she is the 6th PT and the 3rd to join, pretty much becomes the group 2nd in command by the 2nd time you hit the Bank palace and along with Joker is seen as the one responsible for the groups plans. Hell, even the game via giving her the Shadow Calculus and Shadow Factorization reinforce her tactiilcian role in the group
    she's so boring and her s-link is the worst in the game it's not even about her
You complain about bland characters yet you would put joker in top 5 still. Ok
    joker represents your part in the story. he represents you and your journey throughout the game and what you learned after going through all of it.

and persona 5's story is very good with plenty themes and takeaways
        That speaks nothing for his character tho. Just how well you project yourself into his role 

He‚Äôs a deliberately flat character who exists for you to self insert. His character is carried by the personalities of the people he interacts with
            because you are the character
                That‚Äôs my point
                    and you the self insert is a good character
                        Thats completely dumb reasoning. Joker has no personality of his own so you have make it yourself. Bland character gets carried by everyone else including the player
I'm so agree with Makoto part. She's boring and condescending at times, but despite that everyone in team loves her and always ask for her opinion. Her social link isn't even about her, because it looks like she was meant to be Mary-Sue without the flaws (minus the comedy parts in P5 and Strikers where she's afraid of the ghosts, because even that paints her in the "cute way").
    Let's do some analysis:

Makoto is a very nice girl. She is smart, well adjusted, polite, a bit naive, strong, pretty, kind and has a very strong sense of justice...also she is a good strategist (even if they had to take that aspect from Hifumi and gave it to her)

But...

She is also extremely bland, boring, a bit of a stickler and not fun to hang around for long periods of time. She really not the type of person that lights up the room when she is there. A bit of a personal preference, but I appreciate characters that are "fun" to see, hear and just spend time with them. Even Ohya has more charisma than her.

Almost all the girls have different aspect she has PLUS being more fun or interesting than her in my opinion.
Your downvotes are from the makoto defence force also I agree with your statement
I really just said bros before hoes but makoto can hang lmao
He‚Äôs always placed high. Mascots are popular and generally speaking he‚Äôs only unpopular in the west
    He is third last in an asian poll...
        incredible discussion as always on this subreddit
Lmao he's the third least popular of the gang. I don't think very many people like him.
    I expected and wanted him last.
I actually liked Morgana. He felt like the huge improvement over Teddy. It's much more surprising to me that people like Makoto so much, since she's such as party pooper and being praised all the time
    >huge improvement over Teddy

WHAT ?
        Yeah and I stand by this. Teddy is overly horny and that voice is difficult to hear for a long time. He had his moments (like drag pageant and persona awakening) but the overall horniness is tiring.
            And the constant bullying to Ryuji and simping for Ann is better!?
    Teddie is so much better.
    >He felt like the huge improvement over Teddy.

Slander.
Putting aside our personal preferences...is it really surprising with how little screentime Haru gets?
    She neither smart like Makoto, Futuba and Goro so she can't give much good imput but she is also not as stupid as Ryuiji and give bad imput. So they rarely let her say stuff.
Ryuji yea Morgana idk 50/50. 

Everyone‚Äôs love boner for Goro is getting old tho. Dude was a mass murderer I get it his childhood sucked but he‚Äôs literally no different than the other adults other than havin a body count
    Game ‚â† real life he‚Äôs still entertaining af
    He‚Äôs fun and his heel turn in the end is violent and jarring, which makes me like it even more. He‚Äôs basically Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde and his Mr. Hyde was out to play.
        You know he is pretty funni. Ok solid reason. Maybe not my fav but #5 might be about right, give or take a rank
    Eh, human life isnt that valuable. Did you not listen to shido-sans enlightening monologue. It was quite clear about this.
    I mean you can still like the characters and realize he should get punished for his crimes.
No thank you
    Welcome ü§ó
        The good ending
Stay mad, the people have spoken, Makoto fans stay winning
    I'm a Makoto fan too, but "the people have spoken" is probably the worst reason to feel validated when it comes to opinions on fictional works.
Western people when other people have different worldviews(they must be objectively wrong)
    I'm not from west but okay
        Ight
        He technically didn't say you were.
    This poll specifically shows some margin of bad taste though. Like, the silent protagonist in first place? Really? He barely has a personality and writing, and the competitions are a bunch of very solid characters.

I WILL judge people who's favorite character is the silent protagonist. No matter where they're from.
        Joker has more personality than the rest of the cast lmao. He may not say much but everything he says especially when he puts on the mask shows 10 times more than the rest of the cast
            That's just blatantly untrue when the rest of the cast gets full actual dialog to get fleshed out.
                Writing =/= personality. They may be more "deep", but I'm not talking bout that
When did that with Haru happend? Not in Royal.
    in royal, she apparently comes up with an plan on how to kill shadows that even scares Morgana.

She also has a handful of dialogue while exploring where she mentions getting excited when killing enemies or when shadows beg for their lives amongst other things, and the other team members start getting afraid of her.

Then in the dancing game when Ryuji starts thinks about looking around her room she basically tells him if he doesn't stop she's going to kill him with a real axe she always keeps in her room.

Then in Scramble, she apparently makes a detective uncomfortable because she apparently repeatedly tells him she despises him and continues to insult him while keeping a cheerful tone and smile.

Also, everyone is afraid of her psychotic driving.
This is South East Asia poll, and no. You Westerners have bad tastes
Akechi gets an actual social link in Royal and comes back for the third semester >!where he's just full on psycho black mask while in the party which makes him hilarious.!<
Mostly the same in the main story, but he gets a manual confidant until like rank 8 and a lot of scenes in the 3rd semester. I personally only really liked 1 rank from the new confidant, but I gotta say 3rd semester Akechi is quite good.
I'm not a huge fan of Yusuke, personally, but he's so underrated and I kinda fell bad for him. I think his first impression gives people a bad taste.
    This is a new development! I thought everyone loved yusuke!!
        Could be a case of faulty anecdotal evidence on my part.
"Alright!"
Yeah this poll came out in the SEA/Asia/Japan region
To be honest, the English dub makes him a much more likeable character. He comes off like an ass in the Japanese track. I like the Japanese voice a lot, but his character there is much rougher around the edges.
    It‚Äôs not his fault his VA also voiced a deranged genius with a god complex holding a death note
Are you kidding me? Miyano voiced him
Like am not a big fan of him, didn't realize he wasn't liked over there.
    he‚Äôs just honest and doesn‚Äôt sugercoat anything that‚Äôs what i like about him. and he‚Äôs also a loveable idiot i find his japanese va hilarious
As an Asian (not Japanese), i can confirm he is pretty annoying to me and my friends and we have no idea why Westerners love him so much

Louth-mouth people like loud-mouth characters?
    values varies between different cultures
    He's got a heart of gold and always has his friends' backs. He also happens to be a cutie pie.

He may be a loud idiot, but he's MY loud idiot.
        For me, he is like a combination of Kanji and Yosuke from persona 4
The Japanese VA does a great job too! I like his character a lot even though I don't speak Japanese
    ^^^ this. i fell in love with Ryuji because of his JPN VA
        Ye mamoru miyano is op

I don't think that has anything to do with it since his JP va is fantastic too. His character just doesn't seem to appeal to them.
Ryuji's voiced by Miyano Mamoru in Japanese, who is one of the most ridiculously talented seiyuu in the industry.  What you said has absolutely nothing to do with why he places low in polls. He places low in polls because he's kind of a stupid asshole in a game full of characters that *aren't* stupid assholes.
    at least he does the big think like once or twice at palace 4. haven't finished the game but god dam, i won't be surprised if Ryuji was the sole reason everyone got caught despite the multiple loose ends our lovable crew leaves behind

        What? Why would that make him more relatable in the West? There are people like Ryuji absolutely everywhere.
Arc stolen by Morgana moment.
    Haru got fucked.


Like Naoto was the last character to join the party in P4 too but she was already investigating the case and had contact with the party for  months in advance and upon joining the party becomes more or less the most important member given she's smarter than the rest of them (though that's a low bar lol) and basically becomes Velma and solves the mystery for the gang.



Haru just comes out of nowhere, her arc is half stolen by Morgana and then doesn't add much to the party. As much as I love her, she's not important to the story, I'm glad Strikers at least gave her a spotlight for a bit.
        Naoto kinda takes charge of the whole investigation the moment she joins since she's a detective.

Haru brings nothing meaningful to the table when she joins. And P5 has a real problem keeping characters relevant past their initial chapter.
    And never gets focus after that, except a few moments during the Akechi thing in Shido's Palace.

And is a background character for half the story.

And her confidant unlocks the latest of all of them.

And PQ2 also ditches her.

Thr only game that gives her anything is Strikers and it's only one arc and a few scenes.
Another issue, from what I heard, is that unlike most of the other characters, she doesn't get much story. So on top of getting her so late, she also suffers from non-interesting story syndrome. Something that was slightly fixed in Strikers where she got her own dedicated and lengthy story.

Haru was going to be a potential romantic option in my first cycle because I liked her as a character in Strikers, but I chose Futaba as a first cycle romance option because of her being an introvert, a nerd, and honestly just seemed like me if I was a girl born in Japan given my rough history with my dad. Not nearly as bad as what happened to her but still sucks.
    Also by that point most people probably already decided on a partner that is unfortunately not yusuke, so haru suffers from that as well, sumire doesn‚Äôt suffer from this problem cause even tho she becomes a romance option wayyy later in the game she gets teased at the start of the game and you regularly talk to her when she was a normal person so people could hold out for her.
    That first point is a good one. Ryuji and Ann have the same problem but at least they join at the beginning and are vital/essential in the recruitment of the next two Phantom Thieves.

After the Spaceport Palace, there is the Casino Palace where it is a Akechi, Futaba and Makoto show.

Then next is the Cruiser arc where again, I'd argue it was a good showing by Makoto and Futaba (Futaba really does get a lot of story content doesn't she)

Haru...other than the interaction with the TV exec is kinda just there like Ryuji
        I mean they all, sans Haru unfortunately, have a story to themselves. Ryuji was an ex-track member booted out by Kamoshida, Ann was forced into sexual relations with said corrupt teacher, Yusuke was lied to by his mentor who plagiarized art. And so much more. Haru just... doesn't get a lot.

    Exact opposite for me, it weren‚Äôt ‚Äúrich problems‚Äù, it was about trusting people, she couldn‚Äôt trust anyone because everyone seemed to be after her wealth and to control her life by putting on fake smiles, I found that kind of relatable, trusting people is a gamble and haru had the worst odds but still she persevered and tried to control her own life and ultimately it paid of *spoilers* when it turned out that the new ceo the person she distrusted the most was actually the only guy that was trustable, her gamble paid off and showed about showing a little trust can go a long way.
I would give that to Makoto
    I love Makoto, but beep boop
        If I were to choose one to date, it would be Makoto since she seems to be the most faithful one. She's also willing to try and learn new things. She had a lot of fun playing in the game center. She's only boring if you are boring.
    Fuck you she has a bike (face value as in players perspective of course the other students don't know about Johanna)
        Bikes are cool but it doesn‚Äôt make up for how boring Makoto is.
            1 you are jealous, 2 she pegs Ryuji, 3 you are jealous over 2, 4 you are right
                Most mentally sane Makoto fan
                    Nahh the only thing I enjoy about Makoto is the bike and Ryuji. Apart from Tae, I would stan 2/3rds of the male characters before I begin thinking about the girls
    I spat my drink
Are you talking about the English dub? Because not only I've never heard her in it, I honestly couldn't care less.

This poll is either from Asia or worldwide (I found conflicting reports in the comments) so I imagine that's a non-factor as well. Most people outisde of English-speaking countries don't play with the English dub.

If you're talking about the Japanese voice, well then just agree to disagree, I really like Haruka Tomatsu's work with her.
    Yes, I am speaking of the English dub.  While I'm aware Persona has a global audience, as we're in the primarily-English Persona sub I assume that is typical of at a small majority of users here, though I am sure there are many like yourself who prefer to play with the Japanese dub.  As I do not speak Japanese, I do not, and I can only speak to my experience.
        But this thread is about an international poll and you're talking about the character's popularity based on a dub.

And honestly, even this sub has a lot of people with more strong opinions about the dub, I imagine like myself a lot tend to keep somewhat quiet because of how strongly dub fans tend to react to this kind of criticism.

You immediately jumped to the "I don't speak Japanese" crap like people who don't know English don't play translated games with the English dub (and if I got a penny every time I've seen native English speakers lash out or ridicule a foreign dub of an English-original property, let's just say I'd have a lot of pennies. But when people argue for original Japanese audio in Japanese games they're just le disgusting weeb right?)
            I was speaking of *my personal* reasoning for putting Haru last on the list.  Further, I acknowledged in my comment that others who don't speak Japanese often play without the English dub, only explaining that I do and gave my personal reasoning.  I did not call you, or anyone, a weeb, or disparage anyone's language choice in any way.  You're reading a lot into this that I did not say or imply, and I feel like this isn't about me but rather I am being projected onto. I am not others, and any issues you have with others does not feel right to pin onto me.
                My apologies, I didn't mean to imply that all applied to you or to lash out. I was similarly trying to describe my experience dealing with native English-speaking fans, but somewhere alonge the way I got too caught up in the venting lol. Sorry.
                    Apology accepted, thank you.  Cheers.
Ann isn't a kouhai though. She's the classmate archetype who sits next to the protag.
? she was never that archetype.
what skipping cutscenes does to a man
    Nahh if anything bro only watches cutscenes
Too bad the anime and strikers did him no favours and made him the second most nothing character in the series, Boy with Earring still not beats him though
    Yeah, they did nothing with him in strikers thats true. I was just talking about the main game itself tho.

The persona animes are....... a thing you could watch. I dont personally put much weight in them. They can be fun but they clearly arent meant to make a lot of sense or be consistent. They are just fanservice. Just look at the first scene in the P4 anime where Yu gets his persona...
        They made both Makoto and Yu interesting characters, so I give them props for that
            Sure but they also made Yu nuke like 700 shadows into oblivion the second he got his persona.

The anime are for-fun fanservice as i see them, instead of serious additions to the characters writing or the plot.
                That was for the Golden anime which was specifically supposed to emulate a new game plus run and show off the new stuff for P4 Golden

The original p4 anime he fights just 2 and it's a bit of a struggle as it show the original journey through P4.
                    Oh okay, ill have to check out the regular P4 anime.

I genuinely thought the golden one was all there was for 4.
                        Nah there‚Äôs a 20+ episode series that really gives Yu a character all his own and shows how he brings out the best in his team.

It also shows Yu‚Äôs shadow and his crippling abandonment issues
                            Hmm. That sounds really good compared to the 4G and 5 ones.
                        The Vanilla P4 anime is amazing.  Highly recommend.
Joker is my third least party member favourite character in the franchise, I‚Äôd take Ayase over Ren any day
    My bad, guess I just really like his design
        His design if fine, good even, but a character is more than their artwork 

The only characters I like less than him are Boy-With-Earring as he‚Äôs even less of a character than Ren, and Yukari who is the only character to actively piss me off with her attitude and actions.

I can‚Äôt like Ren as a character because there is no character there to like.
            Yeah I get that, self inserts are difficult to put a personality onto but I'm big on making the character mine so they always have a consistent character rather than whatever I find funny. It really is just up to how you play games
                The issue is that not only have they given both Makoto and Yu personality in other works, they are good personalities that elevate the interactions and connections with the other characters 

In regards to Ren however they have gon on record and said said giving him personality limits what they can do with him, which is nonsense as him not being allowed to have personality is even more limiting in how scenes can play out, and feels like they are desperate not to say ‚Äúso that the player/watcher can pretend to have friends or a girlfriend‚Äù
                    Yeah, I do agree but self inserts are personal preference
                        I find they only work when you have a significant amount of dialogue options, very frequently. For example Dragon Age: Origins, Divinity Original Sin 2, or Knights of the old Republic 2.

The way Persona handles it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhow do you want to react to this‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äústoic, sarcastic, or goofy, pick one‚Äù it just feels lazy and jarring to have so little come from the main character who interacts with so many well written characters
                            I see your point. I haven't played origins, but I have played Inquisition, and there are lots of dialogue choices, and they definitely have a bigger impact compared to persona 5. They also give you ways to actually build a coherent character with some nuance, like how it's tracks your position on being the Herald of Andraste and religion. I guess I just didn't expect much depth going into Persona 5 and focused on who looked cool. I had heard before playing that the story was kinda shallow, so I guess I focused on who looked coolest
True!

basically asia has bias for cute and smart characters
    [deleted]
Japanese players love their silent protags.
I‚Äôd argue he has a little bit of personality in the game, not much but there is something. Also things like his phantom thief outfit may be a factor as well.
Harry Potter is not a Gary Stu, he sucks so bad at so many things; half of the books felt like him luckily stumbling through the obstacles more than anything else. I was always annoyed at how he sucked at things when I read the books while I was younger. He‚Äôs more of a brave idiot than anything else.
    Yeah the only thing he was the best at was combat. He was the best duelist in his batch and that's it
Yet they have no qualms against the rebel leader and a cyber terrorist. I think it's just because Ryuji is loud, obnoxious, and--I say this with love--dangerously stupid at times.
    I guess Junpei or Yosuke weren't very well received then since they are at least two of those - possibly all three. Haven't played 3 but I imagine Junpei is among the first people the protag meets and among the first that gets his Persona.
        Japan respects intelligence and in the games I‚Äôve played (3-5) I feel like Yosuke is one of the most intelligent party members you get. Sure he isn‚Äôt book smart but he really sets the pace and leads the investigation until Naoto joins. Most of the progress they make comes from Yosuke and he‚Äôs kind of the stand-in for the silent protagonist in terms of deductions and abstract thinking.
        Yosuke feels much more different than Ryuji. I think they went too far with the loud and dumb personality of Ryuji in the main story, he's like some caricature. Yosuke is more like a normal highschooler and is extremely popular in Japan.
            I dunno. Ryuji is more endearing than anything. Mostly because I do enjoy more slapstick goofy characters with a badass streak, Yosuke is in that league too by the way - by way of just being the butt monkey of the Investigation Team along with Teddie and sometimes Kanji.
                I think the difference is that Yosuke is responsible (he has a job), smart, and not as loud and as aggressive as Ryuji.
        Er no. The loud, physical, dumbass rough and tumble character of the Investigative Team is Chie (she is the Strength Arcana for a reason)

Junpei IS of the Strength Arcana but I would never consider him the rebel, delinquent of the SEES team
            Strength? Weren't they Chariots?
                Junpei is Magician
                    Oh right, my bad.
                Whoops...yeah I meant Chariot.

 I am a little bit disappointed that people. constantly equate Yosuke with Jumpei and Ryuji when Chie is RIGHT THERE

It isn't like Chie joins the game at the end like Haru.....
                    It's because Yosuke plays the role of the best friend from the start so people will most likely draw parallels with characters who play a similar role (but then it should be Yukari instead of Junpei lol, she feels much more like a bro than him).

Though ngl, my big reason for not associating Yosuke with Ryuji unless I'm making a comparison that's favorable to Ryuji is because he's wholesome while Yosuke is homophobic (and being bi... I just cannot bring myself to like a homophobic character).
                        Yosuke was originally designed to be bi as well, which is where the internalized homophobia comes from. Since they cut the romance he ends up just seeming like an asshole but he does grow and towards the end of the game I feel like he genuinely accepts Kanji and gets over his prejudice.
                        I actually agree with you. Female protagonist of persona 3, yes, Junpei is her best friend among the SEES team

But regular male protag? I NEVER got the impression they were friends much less best friends. Yukari, yeah I'm there with you

Which furthermore drives me up a wall when those 3 get equated. The only commonality between the three is that they are the first person to join your party
                            And not even that, in fact, as I'm pretty sure Yukari joined before Junpei in 3 lmao. They're just the first dudes.
        Nah I've seen Yosuke quite high up on these polls
I‚Äôm Asian, but not Japanese. We generally don‚Äôt like Ryuji because he‚Äôs rude and annoying. We don‚Äôt like muscle-bound idiots
It's more like Japan and East Asia don't like dumb people.
out of everybody in the cast, i honestly thought she had the most potential to be black mask.
My favorite kinds of people are people from regions
I think morgana is one of the better written ones among the phantom thieves, if he had an actual confidant it would have been even better. But people just blindly hate on the superficial aspects and completely ignore his internal struggles,these are the same people who run away from a problem/equation rather than trying to understand it.
    Personally I think his confidant worked out being main story as it acknowledges plot events. Plus there‚Äôs his endgame role.

Considering that Mona is mostly with us 24/7, can‚Äôt exactly see him as a manual confidant.
        Yeah, might have had the opposite effect and make people even more mad. I personally would have loved one, a confidant which explores insecurity and fear of losing a home. Or they could have done it like the twins and have 2 ways of interaction.
            His existing confidant already kinda hints at that though. 

Like the times he confides in Joker, you can sense the insecurity he has building up till it boils around the Okumura arc.

I assume you wanted more via access to a manual one so it adds more layers on top of the existing main story scenes?
                Yup thats right, and if you do all of that you get special scenes with morgana at the end of the story,  like how you get extra dialogue from lavenza about her love if you do all the twin requests. most confidants explore one topic like ryuji with moving on, yusuke and motivation etc.., insecurity is a much bigger and interesting topic that i would love to be shown in depth with morgana.
    Imo his character is also written really cleverly in regards to his Arcana as well

The Magician represents the concept of ‚Äúas above, so below‚Äù‚Äî meaning heaven and earth reflect each other, microcosms and macrocosms reflect each other, the ‚Äúinner world‚Äù of the self and the ‚Äúouter world‚Äù reflect each other, etc. In Persona, the Metaverse and reality reflect each other. The Magician additionally represents the  ability to travel between these two worlds, just like how Morgana acts as the Thieves‚Äô guide to the Metaverse.

The Magician Arcana can also represent someone ‚Äúcoming into their own‚Äù, just like how Morgana finds his place in the world and among the Phantom Thieves despite his insecurities.
    I‚Äôm in a weird spot for Morgana because I agree he has some depth with his internal struggles about who he is and where he came from BUT I can not stand the him ditching the phantom thieves. I was so annoyed with that entire arc and it easily my least favorite part every time I play.

It also just annoys me from a story writing perspective because it robbed Haru of her story but that‚Äôs off subject.
Also if one bothered to pfbtbthbfht
I agree, I don‚Äôt really get the hate for Morgana on this sub. I felt pretty indifferent towards him during my first playthrough, he was just the cute cat character that was annoying sometimes. 

Ryuji on the other hand is downright one of the worst main cast Persona characters imo. He won‚Äôt shut the fuck up about booba and how much he deserves money, chicks, and power just because he‚Äôs a phantom thief. They nearly get caught because of his ego/stupidity and he still screams about being a thief in public because ‚Äúlulz that‚Äôs just how real teenagers act xDD‚Äù. Literally none of the other characters act half as stupid. He was great for the first 10 hours of the game and then dove straight to rock bottom in terms of character development.
    Don‚Äôt exactly agree there with your assessment of Ryuji.

Him acting like that is very much the point of his main story character arc where he has to develop from his flaws of being an immature glory seeker that wants to be a famous hero that gets rewarded and acknowledged to make up for how much of a loser he is in the real world. As well as being someone who doesn‚Äôt see the value and appeal of being ‚ÄúA Hero that lurks in the shadows‚Äù as opposed to those in the limelight.

He actually does develop past that mindset post Okumura arc with their downfall giving him a wake up call and humbling him.

I disagree with the notion that teenagers wouldn‚Äôt act like him. Mishima with drunk on power he was and insecure about being a ‚Äúzero‚Äù is not that different from Ryuji‚Äôs attitude.

Any immature teenager that is a loser with nothing big going on for them in life naturally would take having superpowers with real gusto.

Reason why the other Thieves aren‚Äôt like that is because they have some silver lining in the real world which isn‚Äôt like your typical teenager (barring Morgana who has it worse due to no memories or identity):

Ann is a successful model, Makoto is student council president and honour student, Yusuke is an aspiring artist, Futaba is a hacking prodigy that was the founder of a hacking vigilante organisation, Akechi is the 2nd coming of the detective prince and Kasumi is a talented gymnast. 

Joker can make something of himself in the real world due to the player.
        I also want to add that the only reason why Ryuji has nothing going on for him in the real world is that Kamoshida fucked up his knee. If not for that, he would be a successful runner. That would be his "silver lining".
            Yep. Nice follow up.

Ryuji‚Äôs story of having a career ending injury is similar to Anna Yoshizaka from Persona 2.
        I mean, sure losers can aspire to have power because they don't have anything in the real world. But Joker is on probation and nearly risked losing his entire livelihood because of Ryuji's stupid mistakes/inability to control himself. And while Ryuji was very well aware of Joker's situation, his desire for attention took precedence over the safety of his own supposed "best friend". My point is that the whole theme and motif of the Phantom Thieves is that they work anonymously because there are legitimate real-world consequences they must face if their identities are revealed. They reject the status-quo of society and manifest their own brand of justice by their own means, whether it's right or wrong. They are NOT superheroes. Nearly every character related to the Phantom Thieves, sans Ryuji and Mishima, is aware of this fact. I'm not a fan of writing a character as a complete dumbass with zero common sense for the sake of trying to portray an inferiority/hero complex.

Admittedly I'm only halfway through my second playthrough after years of playing vanilla P5, but I don't recall Ryuji drastically improving after the Okumura arc. From what I recall, he was almost like an entirely different person during his social link vs the main story. Yes, Okamura was Ryuji's lowest point as a character. But he doesn't really do anything to make up for it afterward or have any redeeming qualities to his character post-Kamoshida that make him endearing to me.
Ryuji used to piss me off during my first playthrough because he was constantly shouting **HEY EVERYBODY WE'RE THE PHANTOM THIEVES!** To everyone in a 20 kilometer radius.

That being said, I've replayed the game many times and he really grew on me. Haru is still best girl though and it's a travesty that she isn't ranked higher.
    >constantly shouting **HEY EVERYONE WE'RE THE PHANTOM THIEVES!** To everyone in a 20 kilometer radius

Tbf, they are a group of 16 year-olds. That's the most realistic thing in the entire game
        16 year olds are not that dumb, ryuji is just mentally 5
            I don‚Äôt mean to generalize, but I‚Äôve seen 16 year olds do way dumber things than Ryuji, so it‚Äôs not that unrealistic
My man!! Yusuke,akechi and maruki are my holy trinity of persona 5 characters.
I do totally understand that Joker has character, his bond with Akechi despite the players actual feelings being a core trait. I just find it kinda disappointing that most people choose the self-insert over the actual characters.

Joker definitely deserves a good ranking for the personality shown in answer choices and his unique personas (arsene etc), but not necessarily first place.
    Oh, when you put it that way, I agree.
I just kinda feel like they made every other character stupider when she joined to make her look smart by comparison when she never really does anything smart or has good plans or anything.

She looks cool and I enjoy the angry overachiever archetype but I just feel she‚Äôs a bad example of it.
    I don't see it personally as neither Ryuji or Ann's characterizations really made them out to be gifted academically, Yusuke is solely focused on his art, Joker's a blank slate self insert, and all of Morgana's knowledge is specialized and related to palaces/personas. Makoto showing up and having a slight edge on her classmates intellectually doesn't bother me as she's both a year older and presented as a student who's focused on her academic career. If they made her out to be some kind of super genius prodigy with a towering intellect then I'd be more inclined to agree with you and call her unrealistic but instead she comes across as a well read teenager with booksmarts but no street smarts.

Makoto is the reliable party member who outside of Joker deals most with Akechi, sometimes acting like a liason. She reviews and provides more input on plans outlines than the others and the whole heist on Sae's Palace sees her heavily involved with the preparation of the baits and switches. She does a decent amount of heavy lifting in her own right, I think people just lose sight of that because she's less outwardly wacky than all the others. Her dumb decisions mostly stem from hubris and naivetey rather than actual idiocy so for all of that I think she's consistent and believable as a smarter than average teenager.

I still respect your opinion though
        My only problem with Makoto's intelligence is when she does really stupid shit and it's treated as though she's being smart.

Like we find one of Kaneshiro's men and instead of trying to extract information or tail him we get this:

Makoto: Hello there suspicious looking hooligan. Are you selling illegal substances by chance? 

Makoto: I think that guy was part of the Mafia...

That's some Ryuji level subtly there...
            Or to make Makoto look smart she becomes semi omnipotent.

Like I just passed the Okumura section and when Futaba explains the Phan site had been hacked Makoto says something like:

"Well obviously then we were set up to take down Okumura by the cause of the mental shutdowns and they know who we are."

There's more possible explanations than that. The Phantom theifs are household names right then and not just the villians wanted Okumura to have a change of hearts. But Makoto is "smart" so she gets to skip all the incorrect possibilities so she can be correct.
                I mean... it's a suggestion? It's not like she 100% knew it. She dropped a hypothesis to consider.
                    My problem is that the hypothesis was flawless at the time. Theoretically, the character wouldn't know they're correct, but hindsight shows it was pretty much perfect.

It's not really the only time, just the one that most took me out of the moment.

Her suspecting you as Phantom Theifs because you had problems with Komoshida. The whole volleyball team had an issue with him. christ, he raped a girl, there's quite a few people who'd want to get him.

She perfectly gets to Kaneshiro by demanding some random thugs take her there. Somehow, it works flawlessly, and she doesn't have something worse than a threat happen to her.

She gets into Kaneshiro's palace, having been in the metaverse for 5 minutes.

Hope I'm not coming off as rude or dismissive. This was my thought process during the game, these could absolutely be problematic to me and not you, just wanted to share something I saw as a flaw during my playthrough.
                        Idk, I really don't feel like it's that farfetched or crazy of a hypothesis to make. All of the thieves have constantly been saying "things have been going too smoothly" to indicate how they think there's a possibility all of it is scripted. They know that there's a third party involved because of the black mask too. The hypothesis makes sense imo.

Also, while there are others who hate Kamoshida, you're the only one who had an actual vocal problem about him. Everyone suffering keeps quiet, and those that don't suffer are ignorant usually. Plus, you arrive at the school, and in the span of a month you start beefing with him, he's about to expel you and he confesses to his crimes on the day that you're supposed to get expelled. The coincidences are too great to not suspect Joker and his crew tbh.

The Kaneshiro situation is just dumb luck though. Sure it was "the correct play" in hindsight, but everyone agreed that it was a stupid thing to do and out of character. She even feels bad about it and apologizes. Maybe you can argue they got off too easily, but that's a different issue than Makoto at that point.

Idk, I just never really felt like she was being too big brained in the main story.
            I thought that was the point honestly? Like her being book smart but not actually good at "in the moment" smart.
                See that's a fine flaw to have--but she's treated as if she's being intelligent in the moment, when she's really not.
                    You're the only person there though, you can decide if you want to praise her or not.

Plus she says some dumbass shit like "he was dodging all my traps", like there's no way they wanted you to take her seriously. It just shows how she doesn't really get how people work.
                        I'll have to double check, but didn't both of Joker's options say that he was impressed or something to that effect?
                            You can do that in some cases, but the rest of the team immediately shames you for not praising the Queen. It's like every reaction but praise is a crime
                            Well yeah, two of them. But aren't there three? So just don't go for that option and she doesn't get praised.
            She addresses that herself though, stating she messed up by being too desperate to be useful to someone.  It‚Äôs a trait of hers that she learned to overcome.  Unlike say, Ryuji who remains pretty dumb and loud throughout the story.
I think its because blank slate characters are easiest to latch onto. The lack of any voice acting makes it so you can give him any tone while choosing responses. That's my logic anyway, I tend to make him the reasonable authority between the outgoing Ryuji, the cocky cat thief Morgana, and the sweet but sometimes whiny Ann (no hate to her, I love her too). Who are the closest friends to the protag compared to the characters coming later, since the four of them went through the most palaces together (Kamoshida onward).
Yesss I love her character. The way she own her personality and beauty is really inspiring. Also the feeling of being different somewhere where being different is frowned upon is really relatable.
    And her romantic interactions are so cute ü•∞
        I haven't seen them cause I usually don't go to any romance routes. I mean...persona is really limiting for a gay guy but the bro hang outs are cool enough. Ann always felt like that first girl bff you make that you share your spicy life stories with I we a fun sleepover lmao.
Interesting, I wasn\`t aware of that.

Man you wouldn't survive playing Shin Megami Tensei LMAO
    Im always surprised why people like this can't appreciate a good villain in a story, millions of people love Darth Vader because of what he brings to the story but we're suppose to hate him because he killed loads of people is stupid.
        Same, sincerely Akechi isn't even the worse villain in a JRPG, and he's actually vanilla like AF compared with the other personas

The most interesting character in P5 for sure is him, so I don't get who think that people can't actually understand he's not right in his choices and still like this character

Like I said, wouldn't survive playing a SMT game
            never said he was the worst character, simply stated idk why people love him sm when hes a mass murderer. you‚Äôve further proved my point
                Because he's well written lmao also no one needs a reason to like a character, I can't understand who likes Yusuke or Haru too much either, but who cares? Why you like or not a character is a matter of personal taste

I like characters that are complex more than simple juvenile ones, that's why ¬Ø‚Å†\‚Å†_‚Å†(‚Å†„ÉÑ‚Å†)‚Å†_‚Å†/‚Å†¬Ø

But sincerely if I give my real opinion about P5 this sub will ban me
    i would survive them, i just wouldnt be chill with the serial killer characters, sorry if that triggers u
Responded to a 3 month old comment whilst dropping a horrible take. Yikes.
    A dismal take
I think you mean emotionally assertive. He's able recognize and display his own emotions, thoughts, and feelings to those around him. He's open and honest with the way he feels at all times and he isn't afraid to hide himself.   


While this is a good character trait for him because it helps better show off the simplicity in his nature, it is indirectly different from emotional intelligence, which would be more like understanding how others feel.
>Ryuji


>emotionally intelligent

Pick one
>surprisingly emotionally intelligent

Doubt.

Did you see his spat with Morgana, or when he made fun of Ann crying over him?
    [deleted]
        I have seen this before but I don't get the tantrum argument. From basically the start of his social rank, Morgana has been unsure about his place in the world

An emotionally intelligent person like Haru can pick up on this and not target those insecurities...and what does Ryuji do?
            You don't even need to be emotionally intelligent. Even Futaba knew Ryuji was fucking up big time.
        You mean when Ryuji kept pushing Morgana's buttons despite him clearly being upset about it, and then made a half-assed apology, then yes. 

They were both insufferable. Ryuji isn't as emotionally intelligent as people like to claim him as lol.
To be fair about the Morgana part, he literally just attacked Ryuji upon first meeting him and hasn't stopped being mean to him since, even in battle. *Of course* Ryuji would fight back, being a teenager (and a more abrasive one at that).
She's the ideal woman period. Ann may be the lovers arcana but atlus never misses the chance to tell us "hey check out these two nerds! Aren't they cute together?"
Agree. I do get that he's a good guy, but sometimes he's completely insufferable
Ryuji: Bold and Brash
Lol no. Ryuji is arguably the most realistic out of all of them.
    Bruh what he's literally a delinquant that yells 24/7. That's pretty damn overblown.
        If you‚Äôre closed minded and don‚Äôt read between the lines, yeah. The circumstances that lead up to him being a delinquent is part of why and how he came up with the idea of everyone becoming PTs. He was verbally and physically abused as a child by his father and by his PE teacher. As a result of Kamoshida‚Äôs comments about his mother, he lost his temper which made him lose his track scholarship to help take care of his mother. When he needed emotional support/guidance throughout the situation, his peers and teachers crucified and blamed him for the entire situation. He was essentially gaslighted for defending himself against Kamoshida‚Äôs intent to ruin his life. Everything that mattered to Ryuji was taken away from him as a result of Kamoshida‚Äôs bullying/treatment towards him. Him having anger tantrums and constantly being loud is a result of him not receiving the psychological and emotional help that he needed from the same school system that crucified him for being physically assaulted and took away academic and financial opportunities from him. And another reason he is this way is because he wants to help people get out of their troubling circumstances and be happier/live better lives. You can see this reflected throughout every single character arc. So no, he is NOWHERE close to being an anime trope.
            But you're not being closed-minded yourself when it comes to describing Makoto's defining trait as only exagerated intelligence?
                Nope. She‚Äôs literally made as the voice of reason and as the leader when she first joins the party. Nothing closed minded about that. It‚Äôs the most defining characteristic that she has in the game. Take that away from her, and people wouldn‚Äôt like her as much as they do now.
                    So Makoto's arc and backstory never happened? I just think it's a bit ironic and biased for you to argue that there is more to Ryuji's character than what's in surface (which I agree with) then turn around and simplify another character.
                        It‚Äôs not simplifying at all. You‚Äôre acting like Makoto‚Äôs role in the entire game isn‚Äôt to be the intelligent leader. Before the party, she was established as the student council president. This translated especially when the team first accepted her as a member of the Phantom Thieves. She took over the planning and strategizing of everything. She doesn‚Äôt know how to separate her council president status from the group in the real world and in the metaverse. This is confirmed by her social link. She says that she wants to know what people like to do for fun. But yet she‚Äôll constantly criticize/ridicule ryuji for his laidback, goofy nature among the group. She doesn‚Äôt know how to not be serious. You don‚Äôt hear or see Ren say half of what she does when he is supposed to be the leader himself, guiding his team.
                            That's her role and part of her character for sure, but that's not her entire character.  What I'm mainly pointing out in this discussion is that you saying that she's overrated because the most she has going for herself is her "exagerrated" intelligence and that's what people like about her when there are other aspects that people can gravitate to (like her responsible attitude, caring and helpful side, humbleness to admit her mistakes especially as a senior and student council president, etc.)

That's like saying Ryuji's entire role is the be the bro/comic relief of the group when while that is true, he has more to his character than that (just like you described). Just like you described that there is a reason why Ryuji acts the way he does, there's also a reason why Makoto acts the way she does. I'm mainly pointing out that it's a biased point of view to only selectively described a character to support your argument while you look at the whole picture for the other.
            I think you misunderstood. I never said that he isn't a good character or anything. He is just quite over the top.
                He is, but to me, it‚Äôs not fair to say that about him because of everything I mentioned. It‚Äôs not like he woke up and wanted to behave this way. There are major psychological reasons surrounding the way he acts sometimes.
Lol you‚Äôre a usual makoto stan who sees their opinion as fact. I can relate to her, but she is definitely not a girl that I would date. Let alone befriend.
    >she is definitely not a girl that I would date. **Let alone** **befriend**.

Well, that explains everything. Just be straight and say you dislike her already.
        You‚Äôre right, I do dislike her. And her fan base. Has nothing to do with what I said previously though, Makoto Stan. No reason for me to sugarcoat anything. Lol.
            I don't have a particular stan. I like all characters equally, but I picked Makoto as a waifu thinking like "if it was real life" thinking. I guess you can't see my logic since you dislike her, so you're opinion will be biased.
                Except your ‚Äúreal life‚Äù thinking doesn‚Äôt define mine. Your sense of realism and mine are two completely different concepts filled with different expectations/standards. Don‚Äôt push your opinion as fact when it‚Äôll never come close to it. If I‚Äôm biased for having a difference of opinion about a video game character, you‚Äôre especially biased for being up Makoto‚Äôs butt to where you perceive her as an ideal person for everyone around you. Blocked. Push your obsession for her elsewhere.
Oh totally. Hifumi, Tae, Sae, Iwai, Sojiro, Kawakami. All way more interesting than Haru.
    I think they wanted to have teens for your core team.
        I was just mentioning side characters that are more interesting than Haru, not characters I wanted in the party.
Hifumi's just a worse Makoto what's the appeal to her?



If her confidant skills weren't so valuable, I'd written her off to Ohya tier.
    Even a "worse" Makoto is a better Haru. Also her SL is great. 10 Let's you swap characters on  other turns that means you don't lose one of Jokers turns. Also Ohya is good, imho the 3rd best adult woman in the game.
she's so boring and her s-link is the worst in the game it's not even about her
joker represents your part in the story. he represents you and your journey throughout the game and what you learned after going through all of it.

and persona 5's story is very good with plenty themes and takeaways
    That speaks nothing for his character tho. Just how well you project yourself into his role 

He‚Äôs a deliberately flat character who exists for you to self insert. His character is carried by the personalities of the people he interacts with
        because you are the character
            That‚Äôs my point
                and you the self insert is a good character
                    Thats completely dumb reasoning. Joker has no personality of his own so you have make it yourself. Bland character gets carried by everyone else including the player
Let's do some analysis:

Makoto is a very nice girl. She is smart, well adjusted, polite, a bit naive, strong, pretty, kind and has a very strong sense of justice...also she is a good strategist (even if they had to take that aspect from Hifumi and gave it to her)

But...

She is also extremely bland, boring, a bit of a stickler and not fun to hang around for long periods of time. She really not the type of person that lights up the room when she is there. A bit of a personal preference, but I appreciate characters that are "fun" to see, hear and just spend time with them. Even Ohya has more charisma than her.

Almost all the girls have different aspect she has PLUS being more fun or interesting than her in my opinion.
He is third last in an asian poll...
    incredible discussion as always on this subreddit
I expected and wanted him last.
>huge improvement over Teddy

WHAT ?
    Yeah and I stand by this. Teddy is overly horny and that voice is difficult to hear for a long time. He had his moments (like drag pageant and persona awakening) but the overall horniness is tiring.
        And the constant bullying to Ryuji and simping for Ann is better!?
Teddie is so much better.
>He felt like the huge improvement over Teddy.

Slander.
She neither smart like Makoto, Futuba and Goro so she can't give much good imput but she is also not as stupid as Ryuiji and give bad imput. So they rarely let her say stuff.
Game ‚â† real life he‚Äôs still entertaining af
He‚Äôs fun and his heel turn in the end is violent and jarring, which makes me like it even more. He‚Äôs basically Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde and his Mr. Hyde was out to play.
    You know he is pretty funni. Ok solid reason. Maybe not my fav but #5 might be about right, give or take a rank
Eh, human life isnt that valuable. Did you not listen to shido-sans enlightening monologue. It was quite clear about this.
I mean you can still like the characters and realize he should get punished for his crimes.
Welcome ü§ó
    The good ending
I'm a Makoto fan too, but "the people have spoken" is probably the worst reason to feel validated when it comes to opinions on fictional works.
I'm not from west but okay
    Ight
    He technically didn't say you were.
This poll specifically shows some margin of bad taste though. Like, the silent protagonist in first place? Really? He barely has a personality and writing, and the competitions are a bunch of very solid characters.

I WILL judge people who's favorite character is the silent protagonist. No matter where they're from.
    Joker has more personality than the rest of the cast lmao. He may not say much but everything he says especially when he puts on the mask shows 10 times more than the rest of the cast
        That's just blatantly untrue when the rest of the cast gets full actual dialog to get fleshed out.
            Writing =/= personality. They may be more "deep", but I'm not talking bout that
in royal, she apparently comes up with an plan on how to kill shadows that even scares Morgana.

She also has a handful of dialogue while exploring where she mentions getting excited when killing enemies or when shadows beg for their lives amongst other things, and the other team members start getting afraid of her.

Then in the dancing game when Ryuji starts thinks about looking around her room she basically tells him if he doesn't stop she's going to kill him with a real axe she always keeps in her room.

Then in Scramble, she apparently makes a detective uncomfortable because she apparently repeatedly tells him she despises him and continues to insult him while keeping a cheerful tone and smile.

Also, everyone is afraid of her psychotic driving.
This is a new development! I thought everyone loved yusuke!!
    Could be a case of faulty anecdotal evidence on my part.
It‚Äôs not his fault his VA also voiced a deranged genius with a god complex holding a death note
he‚Äôs just honest and doesn‚Äôt sugercoat anything that‚Äôs what i like about him. and he‚Äôs also a loveable idiot i find his japanese va hilarious
values varies between different cultures
He's got a heart of gold and always has his friends' backs. He also happens to be a cutie pie.

He may be a loud idiot, but he's MY loud idiot.
    For me, he is like a combination of Kanji and Yosuke from persona 4
^^^ this. i fell in love with Ryuji because of his JPN VA
    Ye mamoru miyano is op
        Based pfp
at least he does the big think like once or twice at palace 4. haven't finished the game but god dam, i won't be surprised if Ryuji was the sole reason everyone got caught despite the multiple loose ends our lovable crew leaves behind
[deleted]
    What? Why would that make him more relatable in the West? There are people like Ryuji absolutely everywhere.
Haru got fucked.


Like Naoto was the last character to join the party in P4 too but she was already investigating the case and had contact with the party for  months in advance and upon joining the party becomes more or less the most important member given she's smarter than the rest of them (though that's a low bar lol) and basically becomes Velma and solves the mystery for the gang.



Haru just comes out of nowhere, her arc is half stolen by Morgana and then doesn't add much to the party. As much as I love her, she's not important to the story, I'm glad Strikers at least gave her a spotlight for a bit.
    Naoto kinda takes charge of the whole investigation the moment she joins since she's a detective.

Haru brings nothing meaningful to the table when she joins. And P5 has a real problem keeping characters relevant past their initial chapter.
And never gets focus after that, except a few moments during the Akechi thing in Shido's Palace.

And is a background character for half the story.

And her confidant unlocks the latest of all of them.

And PQ2 also ditches her.

Thr only game that gives her anything is Strikers and it's only one arc and a few scenes.
Also by that point most people probably already decided on a partner that is unfortunately not yusuke, so haru suffers from that as well, sumire doesn‚Äôt suffer from this problem cause even tho she becomes a romance option wayyy later in the game she gets teased at the start of the game and you regularly talk to her when she was a normal person so people could hold out for her.
That first point is a good one. Ryuji and Ann have the same problem but at least they join at the beginning and are vital/essential in the recruitment of the next two Phantom Thieves.

After the Spaceport Palace, there is the Casino Palace where it is a Akechi, Futaba and Makoto show.

Then next is the Cruiser arc where again, I'd argue it was a good showing by Makoto and Futaba (Futaba really does get a lot of story content doesn't she)

Haru...other than the interaction with the TV exec is kinda just there like Ryuji
    I mean they all, sans Haru unfortunately, have a story to themselves. Ryuji was an ex-track member booted out by Kamoshida, Ann was forced into sexual relations with said corrupt teacher, Yusuke was lied to by his mentor who plagiarized art. And so much more. Haru just... doesn't get a lot.
Exact opposite for me, it weren‚Äôt ‚Äúrich problems‚Äù, it was about trusting people, she couldn‚Äôt trust anyone because everyone seemed to be after her wealth and to control her life by putting on fake smiles, I found that kind of relatable, trusting people is a gamble and haru had the worst odds but still she persevered and tried to control her own life and ultimately it paid of *spoilers* when it turned out that the new ceo the person she distrusted the most was actually the only guy that was trustable, her gamble paid off and showed about showing a little trust can go a long way.
I love Makoto, but beep boop
    If I were to choose one to date, it would be Makoto since she seems to be the most faithful one. She's also willing to try and learn new things. She had a lot of fun playing in the game center. She's only boring if you are boring.
Fuck you she has a bike (face value as in players perspective of course the other students don't know about Johanna)
    Bikes are cool but it doesn‚Äôt make up for how boring Makoto is.
        1 you are jealous, 2 she pegs Ryuji, 3 you are jealous over 2, 4 you are right
            Most mentally sane Makoto fan
                Nahh the only thing I enjoy about Makoto is the bike and Ryuji. Apart from Tae, I would stan 2/3rds of the male characters before I begin thinking about the girls
I spat my drink
Yes, I am speaking of the English dub.  While I'm aware Persona has a global audience, as we're in the primarily-English Persona sub I assume that is typical of at a small majority of users here, though I am sure there are many like yourself who prefer to play with the Japanese dub.  As I do not speak Japanese, I do not, and I can only speak to my experience.
    But this thread is about an international poll and you're talking about the character's popularity based on a dub.

And honestly, even this sub has a lot of people with more strong opinions about the dub, I imagine like myself a lot tend to keep somewhat quiet because of how strongly dub fans tend to react to this kind of criticism.

You immediately jumped to the "I don't speak Japanese" crap like people who don't know English don't play translated games with the English dub (and if I got a penny every time I've seen native English speakers lash out or ridicule a foreign dub of an English-original property, let's just say I'd have a lot of pennies. But when people argue for original Japanese audio in Japanese games they're just le disgusting weeb right?)
        I was speaking of *my personal* reasoning for putting Haru last on the list.  Further, I acknowledged in my comment that others who don't speak Japanese often play without the English dub, only explaining that I do and gave my personal reasoning.  I did not call you, or anyone, a weeb, or disparage anyone's language choice in any way.  You're reading a lot into this that I did not say or imply, and I feel like this isn't about me but rather I am being projected onto. I am not others, and any issues you have with others does not feel right to pin onto me.
            My apologies, I didn't mean to imply that all applied to you or to lash out. I was similarly trying to describe my experience dealing with native English-speaking fans, but somewhere alonge the way I got too caught up in the venting lol. Sorry.
                Apology accepted, thank you.  Cheers.
Nahh if anything bro only watches cutscenes
Yeah, they did nothing with him in strikers thats true. I was just talking about the main game itself tho.

The persona animes are....... a thing you could watch. I dont personally put much weight in them. They can be fun but they clearly arent meant to make a lot of sense or be consistent. They are just fanservice. Just look at the first scene in the P4 anime where Yu gets his persona...
    They made both Makoto and Yu interesting characters, so I give them props for that
        Sure but they also made Yu nuke like 700 shadows into oblivion the second he got his persona.

The anime are for-fun fanservice as i see them, instead of serious additions to the characters writing or the plot.
            That was for the Golden anime which was specifically supposed to emulate a new game plus run and show off the new stuff for P4 Golden

The original p4 anime he fights just 2 and it's a bit of a struggle as it show the original journey through P4.
                Oh okay, ill have to check out the regular P4 anime.

I genuinely thought the golden one was all there was for 4.
                    Nah there‚Äôs a 20+ episode series that really gives Yu a character all his own and shows how he brings out the best in his team.

It also shows Yu‚Äôs shadow and his crippling abandonment issues
                        Hmm. That sounds really good compared to the 4G and 5 ones.
                    The Vanilla P4 anime is amazing.  Highly recommend.
My bad, guess I just really like his design
    His design if fine, good even, but a character is more than their artwork 

The only characters I like less than him are Boy-With-Earring as he‚Äôs even less of a character than Ren, and Yukari who is the only character to actively piss me off with her attitude and actions.

I can‚Äôt like Ren as a character because there is no character there to like.
        Yeah I get that, self inserts are difficult to put a personality onto but I'm big on making the character mine so they always have a consistent character rather than whatever I find funny. It really is just up to how you play games
            The issue is that not only have they given both Makoto and Yu personality in other works, they are good personalities that elevate the interactions and connections with the other characters 

In regards to Ren however they have gon on record and said said giving him personality limits what they can do with him, which is nonsense as him not being allowed to have personality is even more limiting in how scenes can play out, and feels like they are desperate not to say ‚Äúso that the player/watcher can pretend to have friends or a girlfriend‚Äù
                Yeah, I do agree but self inserts are personal preference
                    I find they only work when you have a significant amount of dialogue options, very frequently. For example Dragon Age: Origins, Divinity Original Sin 2, or Knights of the old Republic 2.

The way Persona handles it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhow do you want to react to this‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äústoic, sarcastic, or goofy, pick one‚Äù it just feels lazy and jarring to have so little come from the main character who interacts with so many well written characters
                        I see your point. I haven't played origins, but I have played Inquisition, and there are lots of dialogue choices, and they definitely have a bigger impact compared to persona 5. They also give you ways to actually build a coherent character with some nuance, like how it's tracks your position on being the Herald of Andraste and religion. I guess I just didn't expect much depth going into Persona 5 and focused on who looked cool. I had heard before playing that the story was kinda shallow, so I guess I focused on who looked coolest
[deleted]
Yeah the only thing he was the best at was combat. He was the best duelist in his batch and that's it
I guess Junpei or Yosuke weren't very well received then since they are at least two of those - possibly all three. Haven't played 3 but I imagine Junpei is among the first people the protag meets and among the first that gets his Persona.
    Japan respects intelligence and in the games I‚Äôve played (3-5) I feel like Yosuke is one of the most intelligent party members you get. Sure he isn‚Äôt book smart but he really sets the pace and leads the investigation until Naoto joins. Most of the progress they make comes from Yosuke and he‚Äôs kind of the stand-in for the silent protagonist in terms of deductions and abstract thinking.
    Yosuke feels much more different than Ryuji. I think they went too far with the loud and dumb personality of Ryuji in the main story, he's like some caricature. Yosuke is more like a normal highschooler and is extremely popular in Japan.
        I dunno. Ryuji is more endearing than anything. Mostly because I do enjoy more slapstick goofy characters with a badass streak, Yosuke is in that league too by the way - by way of just being the butt monkey of the Investigation Team along with Teddie and sometimes Kanji.
            I think the difference is that Yosuke is responsible (he has a job), smart, and not as loud and as aggressive as Ryuji.
    Er no. The loud, physical, dumbass rough and tumble character of the Investigative Team is Chie (she is the Strength Arcana for a reason)

Junpei IS of the Strength Arcana but I would never consider him the rebel, delinquent of the SEES team
        Strength? Weren't they Chariots?
            Junpei is Magician
                Oh right, my bad.
            Whoops...yeah I meant Chariot.

 I am a little bit disappointed that people. constantly equate Yosuke with Jumpei and Ryuji when Chie is RIGHT THERE

It isn't like Chie joins the game at the end like Haru.....
                It's because Yosuke plays the role of the best friend from the start so people will most likely draw parallels with characters who play a similar role (but then it should be Yukari instead of Junpei lol, she feels much more like a bro than him).

Though ngl, my big reason for not associating Yosuke with Ryuji unless I'm making a comparison that's favorable to Ryuji is because he's wholesome while Yosuke is homophobic (and being bi... I just cannot bring myself to like a homophobic character).
                    Yosuke was originally designed to be bi as well, which is where the internalized homophobia comes from. Since they cut the romance he ends up just seeming like an asshole but he does grow and towards the end of the game I feel like he genuinely accepts Kanji and gets over his prejudice.
                    I actually agree with you. Female protagonist of persona 3, yes, Junpei is her best friend among the SEES team

But regular male protag? I NEVER got the impression they were friends much less best friends. Yukari, yeah I'm there with you

Which furthermore drives me up a wall when those 3 get equated. The only commonality between the three is that they are the first person to join your party
                        And not even that, in fact, as I'm pretty sure Yukari joined before Junpei in 3 lmao. They're just the first dudes.
    Nah I've seen Yosuke quite high up on these polls
Personally I think his confidant worked out being main story as it acknowledges plot events. Plus there‚Äôs his endgame role.

Considering that Mona is mostly with us 24/7, can‚Äôt exactly see him as a manual confidant.
    Yeah, might have had the opposite effect and make people even more mad. I personally would have loved one, a confidant which explores insecurity and fear of losing a home. Or they could have done it like the twins and have 2 ways of interaction.
        His existing confidant already kinda hints at that though. 

Like the times he confides in Joker, you can sense the insecurity he has building up till it boils around the Okumura arc.

I assume you wanted more via access to a manual one so it adds more layers on top of the existing main story scenes?
            Yup thats right, and if you do all of that you get special scenes with morgana at the end of the story,  like how you get extra dialogue from lavenza about her love if you do all the twin requests. most confidants explore one topic like ryuji with moving on, yusuke and motivation etc.., insecurity is a much bigger and interesting topic that i would love to be shown in depth with morgana.
Imo his character is also written really cleverly in regards to his Arcana as well

The Magician represents the concept of ‚Äúas above, so below‚Äù‚Äî meaning heaven and earth reflect each other, microcosms and macrocosms reflect each other, the ‚Äúinner world‚Äù of the self and the ‚Äúouter world‚Äù reflect each other, etc. In Persona, the Metaverse and reality reflect each other. The Magician additionally represents the  ability to travel between these two worlds, just like how Morgana acts as the Thieves‚Äô guide to the Metaverse.

The Magician Arcana can also represent someone ‚Äúcoming into their own‚Äù, just like how Morgana finds his place in the world and among the Phantom Thieves despite his insecurities.
I‚Äôm in a weird spot for Morgana because I agree he has some depth with his internal struggles about who he is and where he came from BUT I can not stand the him ditching the phantom thieves. I was so annoyed with that entire arc and it easily my least favorite part every time I play.

It also just annoys me from a story writing perspective because it robbed Haru of her story but that‚Äôs off subject.
Don‚Äôt exactly agree there with your assessment of Ryuji.

Him acting like that is very much the point of his main story character arc where he has to develop from his flaws of being an immature glory seeker that wants to be a famous hero that gets rewarded and acknowledged to make up for how much of a loser he is in the real world. As well as being someone who doesn‚Äôt see the value and appeal of being ‚ÄúA Hero that lurks in the shadows‚Äù as opposed to those in the limelight.

He actually does develop past that mindset post Okumura arc with their downfall giving him a wake up call and humbling him.

I disagree with the notion that teenagers wouldn‚Äôt act like him. Mishima with drunk on power he was and insecure about being a ‚Äúzero‚Äù is not that different from Ryuji‚Äôs attitude.

Any immature teenager that is a loser with nothing big going on for them in life naturally would take having superpowers with real gusto.

Reason why the other Thieves aren‚Äôt like that is because they have some silver lining in the real world which isn‚Äôt like your typical teenager (barring Morgana who has it worse due to no memories or identity):

Ann is a successful model, Makoto is student council president and honour student, Yusuke is an aspiring artist, Futaba is a hacking prodigy that was the founder of a hacking vigilante organisation, Akechi is the 2nd coming of the detective prince and Kasumi is a talented gymnast. 

Joker can make something of himself in the real world due to the player.
    I also want to add that the only reason why Ryuji has nothing going on for him in the real world is that Kamoshida fucked up his knee. If not for that, he would be a successful runner. That would be his "silver lining".
        Yep. Nice follow up.

Ryuji‚Äôs story of having a career ending injury is similar to Anna Yoshizaka from Persona 2.
    I mean, sure losers can aspire to have power because they don't have anything in the real world. But Joker is on probation and nearly risked losing his entire livelihood because of Ryuji's stupid mistakes/inability to control himself. And while Ryuji was very well aware of Joker's situation, his desire for attention took precedence over the safety of his own supposed "best friend". My point is that the whole theme and motif of the Phantom Thieves is that they work anonymously because there are legitimate real-world consequences they must face if their identities are revealed. They reject the status-quo of society and manifest their own brand of justice by their own means, whether it's right or wrong. They are NOT superheroes. Nearly every character related to the Phantom Thieves, sans Ryuji and Mishima, is aware of this fact. I'm not a fan of writing a character as a complete dumbass with zero common sense for the sake of trying to portray an inferiority/hero complex.

Admittedly I'm only halfway through my second playthrough after years of playing vanilla P5, but I don't recall Ryuji drastically improving after the Okumura arc. From what I recall, he was almost like an entirely different person during his social link vs the main story. Yes, Okamura was Ryuji's lowest point as a character. But he doesn't really do anything to make up for it afterward or have any redeeming qualities to his character post-Kamoshida that make him endearing to me.
>constantly shouting **HEY EVERYONE WE'RE THE PHANTOM THIEVES!** To everyone in a 20 kilometer radius

Tbf, they are a group of 16 year-olds. That's the most realistic thing in the entire game
    16 year olds are not that dumb, ryuji is just mentally 5
        I don‚Äôt mean to generalize, but I‚Äôve seen 16 year olds do way dumber things than Ryuji, so it‚Äôs not that unrealistic
Oh, when you put it that way, I agree.
I don't see it personally as neither Ryuji or Ann's characterizations really made them out to be gifted academically, Yusuke is solely focused on his art, Joker's a blank slate self insert, and all of Morgana's knowledge is specialized and related to palaces/personas. Makoto showing up and having a slight edge on her classmates intellectually doesn't bother me as she's both a year older and presented as a student who's focused on her academic career. If they made her out to be some kind of super genius prodigy with a towering intellect then I'd be more inclined to agree with you and call her unrealistic but instead she comes across as a well read teenager with booksmarts but no street smarts.

Makoto is the reliable party member who outside of Joker deals most with Akechi, sometimes acting like a liason. She reviews and provides more input on plans outlines than the others and the whole heist on Sae's Palace sees her heavily involved with the preparation of the baits and switches. She does a decent amount of heavy lifting in her own right, I think people just lose sight of that because she's less outwardly wacky than all the others. Her dumb decisions mostly stem from hubris and naivetey rather than actual idiocy so for all of that I think she's consistent and believable as a smarter than average teenager.

I still respect your opinion though
    My only problem with Makoto's intelligence is when she does really stupid shit and it's treated as though she's being smart.

Like we find one of Kaneshiro's men and instead of trying to extract information or tail him we get this:

Makoto: Hello there suspicious looking hooligan. Are you selling illegal substances by chance? 

Makoto: I think that guy was part of the Mafia...

That's some Ryuji level subtly there...
        Or to make Makoto look smart she becomes semi omnipotent.

Like I just passed the Okumura section and when Futaba explains the Phan site had been hacked Makoto says something like:

"Well obviously then we were set up to take down Okumura by the cause of the mental shutdowns and they know who we are."

There's more possible explanations than that. The Phantom theifs are household names right then and not just the villians wanted Okumura to have a change of hearts. But Makoto is "smart" so she gets to skip all the incorrect possibilities so she can be correct.
            I mean... it's a suggestion? It's not like she 100% knew it. She dropped a hypothesis to consider.
                My problem is that the hypothesis was flawless at the time. Theoretically, the character wouldn't know they're correct, but hindsight shows it was pretty much perfect.

It's not really the only time, just the one that most took me out of the moment.

Her suspecting you as Phantom Theifs because you had problems with Komoshida. The whole volleyball team had an issue with him. christ, he raped a girl, there's quite a few people who'd want to get him.

She perfectly gets to Kaneshiro by demanding some random thugs take her there. Somehow, it works flawlessly, and she doesn't have something worse than a threat happen to her.

She gets into Kaneshiro's palace, having been in the metaverse for 5 minutes.

Hope I'm not coming off as rude or dismissive. This was my thought process during the game, these could absolutely be problematic to me and not you, just wanted to share something I saw as a flaw during my playthrough.
                    Idk, I really don't feel like it's that farfetched or crazy of a hypothesis to make. All of the thieves have constantly been saying "things have been going too smoothly" to indicate how they think there's a possibility all of it is scripted. They know that there's a third party involved because of the black mask too. The hypothesis makes sense imo.

Also, while there are others who hate Kamoshida, you're the only one who had an actual vocal problem about him. Everyone suffering keeps quiet, and those that don't suffer are ignorant usually. Plus, you arrive at the school, and in the span of a month you start beefing with him, he's about to expel you and he confesses to his crimes on the day that you're supposed to get expelled. The coincidences are too great to not suspect Joker and his crew tbh.

The Kaneshiro situation is just dumb luck though. Sure it was "the correct play" in hindsight, but everyone agreed that it was a stupid thing to do and out of character. She even feels bad about it and apologizes. Maybe you can argue they got off too easily, but that's a different issue than Makoto at that point.

Idk, I just never really felt like she was being too big brained in the main story.
        I thought that was the point honestly? Like her being book smart but not actually good at "in the moment" smart.
            See that's a fine flaw to have--but she's treated as if she's being intelligent in the moment, when she's really not.
                You're the only person there though, you can decide if you want to praise her or not.

Plus she says some dumbass shit like "he was dodging all my traps", like there's no way they wanted you to take her seriously. It just shows how she doesn't really get how people work.
                    I'll have to double check, but didn't both of Joker's options say that he was impressed or something to that effect?
                        You can do that in some cases, but the rest of the team immediately shames you for not praising the Queen. It's like every reaction but praise is a crime
                        Well yeah, two of them. But aren't there three? So just don't go for that option and she doesn't get praised.
        She addresses that herself though, stating she messed up by being too desperate to be useful to someone.  It‚Äôs a trait of hers that she learned to overcome.  Unlike say, Ryuji who remains pretty dumb and loud throughout the story.
And her romantic interactions are so cute ü•∞
    I haven't seen them cause I usually don't go to any romance routes. I mean...persona is really limiting for a gay guy but the bro hang outs are cool enough. Ann always felt like that first girl bff you make that you share your spicy life stories with I we a fun sleepover lmao.
The ones that i found had them pretty high up though..

Im always surprised why people like this can't appreciate a good villain in a story, millions of people love Darth Vader because of what he brings to the story but we're suppose to hate him because he killed loads of people is stupid.
    Same, sincerely Akechi isn't even the worse villain in a JRPG, and he's actually vanilla like AF compared with the other personas

The most interesting character in P5 for sure is him, so I don't get who think that people can't actually understand he's not right in his choices and still like this character

Like I said, wouldn't survive playing a SMT game
        never said he was the worst character, simply stated idk why people love him sm when hes a mass murderer. you‚Äôve further proved my point
            Because he's well written lmao also no one needs a reason to like a character, I can't understand who likes Yusuke or Haru too much either, but who cares? Why you like or not a character is a matter of personal taste

I like characters that are complex more than simple juvenile ones, that's why ¬Ø‚Å†\‚Å†_‚Å†(‚Å†„ÉÑ‚Å†)‚Å†_‚Å†/‚Å†¬Ø

A dismal take
[deleted]
    I have seen this before but I don't get the tantrum argument. From basically the start of his social rank, Morgana has been unsure about his place in the world

An emotionally intelligent person like Haru can pick up on this and not target those insecurities...and what does Ryuji do?
        You don't even need to be emotionally intelligent. Even Futaba knew Ryuji was fucking up big time.
    You mean when Ryuji kept pushing Morgana's buttons despite him clearly being upset about it, and then made a half-assed apology, then yes. 

They were both insufferable. Ryuji isn't as emotionally intelligent as people like to claim him as lol.
Bruh what he's literally a delinquant that yells 24/7. That's pretty damn overblown.
    If you‚Äôre closed minded and don‚Äôt read between the lines, yeah. The circumstances that lead up to him being a delinquent is part of why and how he came up with the idea of everyone becoming PTs. He was verbally and physically abused as a child by his father and by his PE teacher. As a result of Kamoshida‚Äôs comments about his mother, he lost his temper which made him lose his track scholarship to help take care of his mother. When he needed emotional support/guidance throughout the situation, his peers and teachers crucified and blamed him for the entire situation. He was essentially gaslighted for defending himself against Kamoshida‚Äôs intent to ruin his life. Everything that mattered to Ryuji was taken away from him as a result of Kamoshida‚Äôs bullying/treatment towards him. Him having anger tantrums and constantly being loud is a result of him not receiving the psychological and emotional help that he needed from the same school system that crucified him for being physically assaulted and took away academic and financial opportunities from him. And another reason he is this way is because he wants to help people get out of their troubling circumstances and be happier/live better lives. You can see this reflected throughout every single character arc. So no, he is NOWHERE close to being an anime trope.
        But you're not being closed-minded yourself when it comes to describing Makoto's defining trait as only exagerated intelligence?
            Nope. She‚Äôs literally made as the voice of reason and as the leader when she first joins the party. Nothing closed minded about that. It‚Äôs the most defining characteristic that she has in the game. Take that away from her, and people wouldn‚Äôt like her as much as they do now.
                So Makoto's arc and backstory never happened? I just think it's a bit ironic and biased for you to argue that there is more to Ryuji's character than what's in surface (which I agree with) then turn around and simplify another character.
                    It‚Äôs not simplifying at all. You‚Äôre acting like Makoto‚Äôs role in the entire game isn‚Äôt to be the intelligent leader. Before the party, she was established as the student council president. This translated especially when the team first accepted her as a member of the Phantom Thieves. She took over the planning and strategizing of everything. She doesn‚Äôt know how to separate her council president status from the group in the real world and in the metaverse. This is confirmed by her social link. She says that she wants to know what people like to do for fun. But yet she‚Äôll constantly criticize/ridicule ryuji for his laidback, goofy nature among the group. She doesn‚Äôt know how to not be serious. You don‚Äôt hear or see Ren say half of what she does when he is supposed to be the leader himself, guiding his team.
                        That's her role and part of her character for sure, but that's not her entire character.  What I'm mainly pointing out in this discussion is that you saying that she's overrated because the most she has going for herself is her "exagerrated" intelligence and that's what people like about her when there are other aspects that people can gravitate to (like her responsible attitude, caring and helpful side, humbleness to admit her mistakes especially as a senior and student council president, etc.)

That's like saying Ryuji's entire role is the be the bro/comic relief of the group when while that is true, he has more to his character than that (just like you described). Just like you described that there is a reason why Ryuji acts the way he does, there's also a reason why Makoto acts the way she does. I'm mainly pointing out that it's a biased point of view to only selectively described a character to support your argument while you look at the whole picture for the other.
        I think you misunderstood. I never said that he isn't a good character or anything. He is just quite over the top.
            He is, but to me, it‚Äôs not fair to say that about him because of everything I mentioned. It‚Äôs not like he woke up and wanted to behave this way. There are major psychological reasons surrounding the way he acts sometimes.
>she is definitely not a girl that I would date. **Let alone** **befriend**.

Well, that explains everything. Just be straight and say you dislike her already.
    You‚Äôre right, I do dislike her. And her fan base. Has nothing to do with what I said previously though, Makoto Stan. No reason for me to sugarcoat anything. Lol.
        I don't have a particular stan. I like all characters equally, but I picked Makoto as a waifu thinking like "if it was real life" thinking. I guess you can't see my logic since you dislike her, so you're opinion will be biased.
            Except your ‚Äúreal life‚Äù thinking doesn‚Äôt define mine. Your sense of realism and mine are two completely different concepts filled with different expectations/standards. Don‚Äôt push your opinion as fact when it‚Äôll never come close to it. If I‚Äôm biased for having a difference of opinion about a video game character, you‚Äôre especially biased for being up Makoto‚Äôs butt to where you perceive her as an ideal person for everyone around you. Blocked. Push your obsession for her elsewhere.
I think they wanted to have teens for your core team.
    I was just mentioning side characters that are more interesting than Haru, not characters I wanted in the party.
Even a "worse" Makoto is a better Haru. Also her SL is great. 10 Let's you swap characters on  other turns that means you don't lose one of Jokers turns. Also Ohya is good, imho the 3rd best adult woman in the game.
That speaks nothing for his character tho. Just how well you project yourself into his role 

He‚Äôs a deliberately flat character who exists for you to self insert. His character is carried by the personalities of the people he interacts with
    because you are the character
        That‚Äôs my point
            and you the self insert is a good character
                Thats completely dumb reasoning. Joker has no personality of his own so you have make it yourself. Bland character gets carried by everyone else including the player
incredible discussion as always on this subreddit
Yeah and I stand by this. Teddy is overly horny and that voice is difficult to hear for a long time. He had his moments (like drag pageant and persona awakening) but the overall horniness is tiring.
    And the constant bullying to Ryuji and simping for Ann is better!?
You know he is pretty funni. Ok solid reason. Maybe not my fav but #5 might be about right, give or take a rank
The good ending
Ight
He technically didn't say you were.
Joker has more personality than the rest of the cast lmao. He may not say much but everything he says especially when he puts on the mask shows 10 times more than the rest of the cast
    That's just blatantly untrue when the rest of the cast gets full actual dialog to get fleshed out.
        Writing =/= personality. They may be more "deep", but I'm not talking bout that
Could be a case of faulty anecdotal evidence on my part.
For me, he is like a combination of Kanji and Yosuke from persona 4
Ye mamoru miyano is op
    Based pfp
What? Why would that make him more relatable in the West? There are people like Ryuji absolutely everywhere.
Naoto kinda takes charge of the whole investigation the moment she joins since she's a detective.

Haru brings nothing meaningful to the table when she joins. And P5 has a real problem keeping characters relevant past their initial chapter.
I mean they all, sans Haru unfortunately, have a story to themselves. Ryuji was an ex-track member booted out by Kamoshida, Ann was forced into sexual relations with said corrupt teacher, Yusuke was lied to by his mentor who plagiarized art. And so much more. Haru just... doesn't get a lot.
If I were to choose one to date, it would be Makoto since she seems to be the most faithful one. She's also willing to try and learn new things. She had a lot of fun playing in the game center. She's only boring if you are boring.
Bikes are cool but it doesn‚Äôt make up for how boring Makoto is.
    1 you are jealous, 2 she pegs Ryuji, 3 you are jealous over 2, 4 you are right
        Most mentally sane Makoto fan
            Nahh the only thing I enjoy about Makoto is the bike and Ryuji. Apart from Tae, I would stan 2/3rds of the male characters before I begin thinking about the girls
But this thread is about an international poll and you're talking about the character's popularity based on a dub.

And honestly, even this sub has a lot of people with more strong opinions about the dub, I imagine like myself a lot tend to keep somewhat quiet because of how strongly dub fans tend to react to this kind of criticism.

You immediately jumped to the "I don't speak Japanese" crap like people who don't know English don't play translated games with the English dub (and if I got a penny every time I've seen native English speakers lash out or ridicule a foreign dub of an English-original property, let's just say I'd have a lot of pennies. But when people argue for original Japanese audio in Japanese games they're just le disgusting weeb right?)
    I was speaking of *my personal* reasoning for putting Haru last on the list.  Further, I acknowledged in my comment that others who don't speak Japanese often play without the English dub, only explaining that I do and gave my personal reasoning.  I did not call you, or anyone, a weeb, or disparage anyone's language choice in any way.  You're reading a lot into this that I did not say or imply, and I feel like this isn't about me but rather I am being projected onto. I am not others, and any issues you have with others does not feel right to pin onto me.
        My apologies, I didn't mean to imply that all applied to you or to lash out. I was similarly trying to describe my experience dealing with native English-speaking fans, but somewhere alonge the way I got too caught up in the venting lol. Sorry.
            Apology accepted, thank you.  Cheers.
They made both Makoto and Yu interesting characters, so I give them props for that
    Sure but they also made Yu nuke like 700 shadows into oblivion the second he got his persona.

The anime are for-fun fanservice as i see them, instead of serious additions to the characters writing or the plot.
        That was for the Golden anime which was specifically supposed to emulate a new game plus run and show off the new stuff for P4 Golden

The original p4 anime he fights just 2 and it's a bit of a struggle as it show the original journey through P4.
            Oh okay, ill have to check out the regular P4 anime.

I genuinely thought the golden one was all there was for 4.
                Nah there‚Äôs a 20+ episode series that really gives Yu a character all his own and shows how he brings out the best in his team.

It also shows Yu‚Äôs shadow and his crippling abandonment issues
                    Hmm. That sounds really good compared to the 4G and 5 ones.
                The Vanilla P4 anime is amazing.  Highly recommend.
His design if fine, good even, but a character is more than their artwork 

The only characters I like less than him are Boy-With-Earring as he‚Äôs even less of a character than Ren, and Yukari who is the only character to actively piss me off with her attitude and actions.

I can‚Äôt like Ren as a character because there is no character there to like.
    Yeah I get that, self inserts are difficult to put a personality onto but I'm big on making the character mine so they always have a consistent character rather than whatever I find funny. It really is just up to how you play games
        The issue is that not only have they given both Makoto and Yu personality in other works, they are good personalities that elevate the interactions and connections with the other characters 

In regards to Ren however they have gon on record and said said giving him personality limits what they can do with him, which is nonsense as him not being allowed to have personality is even more limiting in how scenes can play out, and feels like they are desperate not to say ‚Äúso that the player/watcher can pretend to have friends or a girlfriend‚Äù
            Yeah, I do agree but self inserts are personal preference
                I find they only work when you have a significant amount of dialogue options, very frequently. For example Dragon Age: Origins, Divinity Original Sin 2, or Knights of the old Republic 2.

The way Persona handles it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhow do you want to react to this‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äústoic, sarcastic, or goofy, pick one‚Äù it just feels lazy and jarring to have so little come from the main character who interacts with so many well written characters
                    I see your point. I haven't played origins, but I have played Inquisition, and there are lots of dialogue choices, and they definitely have a bigger impact compared to persona 5. They also give you ways to actually build a coherent character with some nuance, like how it's tracks your position on being the Herald of Andraste and religion. I guess I just didn't expect much depth going into Persona 5 and focused on who looked cool. I had heard before playing that the story was kinda shallow, so I guess I focused on who looked coolest
Japan respects intelligence and in the games I‚Äôve played (3-5) I feel like Yosuke is one of the most intelligent party members you get. Sure he isn‚Äôt book smart but he really sets the pace and leads the investigation until Naoto joins. Most of the progress they make comes from Yosuke and he‚Äôs kind of the stand-in for the silent protagonist in terms of deductions and abstract thinking.
Yosuke feels much more different than Ryuji. I think they went too far with the loud and dumb personality of Ryuji in the main story, he's like some caricature. Yosuke is more like a normal highschooler and is extremely popular in Japan.
    I dunno. Ryuji is more endearing than anything. Mostly because I do enjoy more slapstick goofy characters with a badass streak, Yosuke is in that league too by the way - by way of just being the butt monkey of the Investigation Team along with Teddie and sometimes Kanji.
        I think the difference is that Yosuke is responsible (he has a job), smart, and not as loud and as aggressive as Ryuji.
Er no. The loud, physical, dumbass rough and tumble character of the Investigative Team is Chie (she is the Strength Arcana for a reason)

Junpei IS of the Strength Arcana but I would never consider him the rebel, delinquent of the SEES team
    Strength? Weren't they Chariots?
        Junpei is Magician
            Oh right, my bad.
        Whoops...yeah I meant Chariot.

 I am a little bit disappointed that people. constantly equate Yosuke with Jumpei and Ryuji when Chie is RIGHT THERE

It isn't like Chie joins the game at the end like Haru.....
            It's because Yosuke plays the role of the best friend from the start so people will most likely draw parallels with characters who play a similar role (but then it should be Yukari instead of Junpei lol, she feels much more like a bro than him).

Though ngl, my big reason for not associating Yosuke with Ryuji unless I'm making a comparison that's favorable to Ryuji is because he's wholesome while Yosuke is homophobic (and being bi... I just cannot bring myself to like a homophobic character).
                Yosuke was originally designed to be bi as well, which is where the internalized homophobia comes from. Since they cut the romance he ends up just seeming like an asshole but he does grow and towards the end of the game I feel like he genuinely accepts Kanji and gets over his prejudice.
                I actually agree with you. Female protagonist of persona 3, yes, Junpei is her best friend among the SEES team

But regular male protag? I NEVER got the impression they were friends much less best friends. Yukari, yeah I'm there with you

Which furthermore drives me up a wall when those 3 get equated. The only commonality between the three is that they are the first person to join your party
                    And not even that, in fact, as I'm pretty sure Yukari joined before Junpei in 3 lmao. They're just the first dudes.
Nah I've seen Yosuke quite high up on these polls
Yeah, might have had the opposite effect and make people even more mad. I personally would have loved one, a confidant which explores insecurity and fear of losing a home. Or they could have done it like the twins and have 2 ways of interaction.
    His existing confidant already kinda hints at that though. 

Like the times he confides in Joker, you can sense the insecurity he has building up till it boils around the Okumura arc.

I assume you wanted more via access to a manual one so it adds more layers on top of the existing main story scenes?
        Yup thats right, and if you do all of that you get special scenes with morgana at the end of the story,  like how you get extra dialogue from lavenza about her love if you do all the twin requests. most confidants explore one topic like ryuji with moving on, yusuke and motivation etc.., insecurity is a much bigger and interesting topic that i would love to be shown in depth with morgana.
I also want to add that the only reason why Ryuji has nothing going on for him in the real world is that Kamoshida fucked up his knee. If not for that, he would be a successful runner. That would be his "silver lining".
    Yep. Nice follow up.

Ryuji‚Äôs story of having a career ending injury is similar to Anna Yoshizaka from Persona 2.
I mean, sure losers can aspire to have power because they don't have anything in the real world. But Joker is on probation and nearly risked losing his entire livelihood because of Ryuji's stupid mistakes/inability to control himself. And while Ryuji was very well aware of Joker's situation, his desire for attention took precedence over the safety of his own supposed "best friend". My point is that the whole theme and motif of the Phantom Thieves is that they work anonymously because there are legitimate real-world consequences they must face if their identities are revealed. They reject the status-quo of society and manifest their own brand of justice by their own means, whether it's right or wrong. They are NOT superheroes. Nearly every character related to the Phantom Thieves, sans Ryuji and Mishima, is aware of this fact. I'm not a fan of writing a character as a complete dumbass with zero common sense for the sake of trying to portray an inferiority/hero complex.

Admittedly I'm only halfway through my second playthrough after years of playing vanilla P5, but I don't recall Ryuji drastically improving after the Okumura arc. From what I recall, he was almost like an entirely different person during his social link vs the main story. Yes, Okamura was Ryuji's lowest point as a character. But he doesn't really do anything to make up for it afterward or have any redeeming qualities to his character post-Kamoshida that make him endearing to me.
16 year olds are not that dumb, ryuji is just mentally 5
    I don‚Äôt mean to generalize, but I‚Äôve seen 16 year olds do way dumber things than Ryuji, so it‚Äôs not that unrealistic
My only problem with Makoto's intelligence is when she does really stupid shit and it's treated as though she's being smart.

Like we find one of Kaneshiro's men and instead of trying to extract information or tail him we get this:

Makoto: Hello there suspicious looking hooligan. Are you selling illegal substances by chance? 

Makoto: I think that guy was part of the Mafia...

That's some Ryuji level subtly there...
    Or to make Makoto look smart she becomes semi omnipotent.

Like I just passed the Okumura section and when Futaba explains the Phan site had been hacked Makoto says something like:

"Well obviously then we were set up to take down Okumura by the cause of the mental shutdowns and they know who we are."

There's more possible explanations than that. The Phantom theifs are household names right then and not just the villians wanted Okumura to have a change of hearts. But Makoto is "smart" so she gets to skip all the incorrect possibilities so she can be correct.
        I mean... it's a suggestion? It's not like she 100% knew it. She dropped a hypothesis to consider.
            My problem is that the hypothesis was flawless at the time. Theoretically, the character wouldn't know they're correct, but hindsight shows it was pretty much perfect.

It's not really the only time, just the one that most took me out of the moment.

Her suspecting you as Phantom Theifs because you had problems with Komoshida. The whole volleyball team had an issue with him. christ, he raped a girl, there's quite a few people who'd want to get him.

She perfectly gets to Kaneshiro by demanding some random thugs take her there. Somehow, it works flawlessly, and she doesn't have something worse than a threat happen to her.

She gets into Kaneshiro's palace, having been in the metaverse for 5 minutes.

Hope I'm not coming off as rude or dismissive. This was my thought process during the game, these could absolutely be problematic to me and not you, just wanted to share something I saw as a flaw during my playthrough.
                Idk, I really don't feel like it's that farfetched or crazy of a hypothesis to make. All of the thieves have constantly been saying "things have been going too smoothly" to indicate how they think there's a possibility all of it is scripted. They know that there's a third party involved because of the black mask too. The hypothesis makes sense imo.

Also, while there are others who hate Kamoshida, you're the only one who had an actual vocal problem about him. Everyone suffering keeps quiet, and those that don't suffer are ignorant usually. Plus, you arrive at the school, and in the span of a month you start beefing with him, he's about to expel you and he confesses to his crimes on the day that you're supposed to get expelled. The coincidences are too great to not suspect Joker and his crew tbh.

The Kaneshiro situation is just dumb luck though. Sure it was "the correct play" in hindsight, but everyone agreed that it was a stupid thing to do and out of character. She even feels bad about it and apologizes. Maybe you can argue they got off too easily, but that's a different issue than Makoto at that point.

Idk, I just never really felt like she was being too big brained in the main story.
    I thought that was the point honestly? Like her being book smart but not actually good at "in the moment" smart.
        See that's a fine flaw to have--but she's treated as if she's being intelligent in the moment, when she's really not.
            You're the only person there though, you can decide if you want to praise her or not.

Plus she says some dumbass shit like "he was dodging all my traps", like there's no way they wanted you to take her seriously. It just shows how she doesn't really get how people work.
                I'll have to double check, but didn't both of Joker's options say that he was impressed or something to that effect?
                    You can do that in some cases, but the rest of the team immediately shames you for not praising the Queen. It's like every reaction but praise is a crime
                    Well yeah, two of them. But aren't there three? So just don't go for that option and she doesn't get praised.
    She addresses that herself though, stating she messed up by being too desperate to be useful to someone.  It‚Äôs a trait of hers that she learned to overcome.  Unlike say, Ryuji who remains pretty dumb and loud throughout the story.
I haven't seen them cause I usually don't go to any romance routes. I mean...persona is really limiting for a gay guy but the bro hang outs are cool enough. Ann always felt like that first girl bff you make that you share your spicy life stories with I we a fun sleepover lmao.
Persona 3/4/5 popularity poll \*1 year ago\*

First poll is a online site

the second is 13 year.. and the third is the same poll than 2

The only official one that i found are the old one that you linked 2 times and the other that you ignored

[https://personacentral.com/top-10-persona-4-golden-fan-voted-characters/](https://personacentral.com/top-10-persona-4-golden-fan-voted-characters/)
Same, sincerely Akechi isn't even the worse villain in a JRPG, and he's actually vanilla like AF compared with the other personas

The most interesting character in P5 for sure is him, so I don't get who think that people can't actually understand he's not right in his choices and still like this character

Like I said, wouldn't survive playing a SMT game
    never said he was the worst character, simply stated idk why people love him sm when hes a mass murderer. you‚Äôve further proved my point
        Because he's well written lmao also no one needs a reason to like a character, I can't understand who likes Yusuke or Haru too much either, but who cares? Why you like or not a character is a matter of personal taste

I like characters that are complex more than simple juvenile ones, that's why ¬Ø‚Å†\‚Å†_‚Å†(‚Å†„ÉÑ‚Å†)‚Å†_‚Å†/‚Å†¬Ø

But sincerely if I give my real opinion about P5 this sub will ban me
I have seen this before but I don't get the tantrum argument. From basically the start of his social rank, Morgana has been unsure about his place in the world

An emotionally intelligent person like Haru can pick up on this and not target those insecurities...and what does Ryuji do?
    You don't even need to be emotionally intelligent. Even Futaba knew Ryuji was fucking up big time.
You mean when Ryuji kept pushing Morgana's buttons despite him clearly being upset about it, and then made a half-assed apology, then yes. 

They were both insufferable. Ryuji isn't as emotionally intelligent as people like to claim him as lol.
If you‚Äôre closed minded and don‚Äôt read between the lines, yeah. The circumstances that lead up to him being a delinquent is part of why and how he came up with the idea of everyone becoming PTs. He was verbally and physically abused as a child by his father and by his PE teacher. As a result of Kamoshida‚Äôs comments about his mother, he lost his temper which made him lose his track scholarship to help take care of his mother. When he needed emotional support/guidance throughout the situation, his peers and teachers crucified and blamed him for the entire situation. He was essentially gaslighted for defending himself against Kamoshida‚Äôs intent to ruin his life. Everything that mattered to Ryuji was taken away from him as a result of Kamoshida‚Äôs bullying/treatment towards him. Him having anger tantrums and constantly being loud is a result of him not receiving the psychological and emotional help that he needed from the same school system that crucified him for being physically assaulted and took away academic and financial opportunities from him. And another reason he is this way is because he wants to help people get out of their troubling circumstances and be happier/live better lives. You can see this reflected throughout every single character arc. So no, he is NOWHERE close to being an anime trope.
    But you're not being closed-minded yourself when it comes to describing Makoto's defining trait as only exagerated intelligence?
        Nope. She‚Äôs literally made as the voice of reason and as the leader when she first joins the party. Nothing closed minded about that. It‚Äôs the most defining characteristic that she has in the game. Take that away from her, and people wouldn‚Äôt like her as much as they do now.
            So Makoto's arc and backstory never happened? I just think it's a bit ironic and biased for you to argue that there is more to Ryuji's character than what's in surface (which I agree with) then turn around and simplify another character.
                It‚Äôs not simplifying at all. You‚Äôre acting like Makoto‚Äôs role in the entire game isn‚Äôt to be the intelligent leader. Before the party, she was established as the student council president. This translated especially when the team first accepted her as a member of the Phantom Thieves. She took over the planning and strategizing of everything. She doesn‚Äôt know how to separate her council president status from the group in the real world and in the metaverse. This is confirmed by her social link. She says that she wants to know what people like to do for fun. But yet she‚Äôll constantly criticize/ridicule ryuji for his laidback, goofy nature among the group. She doesn‚Äôt know how to not be serious. You don‚Äôt hear or see Ren say half of what she does when he is supposed to be the leader himself, guiding his team.
                    That's her role and part of her character for sure, but that's not her entire character.  What I'm mainly pointing out in this discussion is that you saying that she's overrated because the most she has going for herself is her "exagerrated" intelligence and that's what people like about her when there are other aspects that people can gravitate to (like her responsible attitude, caring and helpful side, humbleness to admit her mistakes especially as a senior and student council president, etc.)

That's like saying Ryuji's entire role is the be the bro/comic relief of the group when while that is true, he has more to his character than that (just like you described). Just like you described that there is a reason why Ryuji acts the way he does, there's also a reason why Makoto acts the way she does. I'm mainly pointing out that it's a biased point of view to only selectively described a character to support your argument while you look at the whole picture for the other.
    I think you misunderstood. I never said that he isn't a good character or anything. He is just quite over the top.
        He is, but to me, it‚Äôs not fair to say that about him because of everything I mentioned. It‚Äôs not like he woke up and wanted to behave this way. There are major psychological reasons surrounding the way he acts sometimes.
You‚Äôre right, I do dislike her. And her fan base. Has nothing to do with what I said previously though, Makoto Stan. No reason for me to sugarcoat anything. Lol.
    I don't have a particular stan. I like all characters equally, but I picked Makoto as a waifu thinking like "if it was real life" thinking. I guess you can't see my logic since you dislike her, so you're opinion will be biased.
        Except your ‚Äúreal life‚Äù thinking doesn‚Äôt define mine. Your sense of realism and mine are two completely different concepts filled with different expectations/standards. Don‚Äôt push your opinion as fact when it‚Äôll never come close to it. If I‚Äôm biased for having a difference of opinion about a video game character, you‚Äôre especially biased for being up Makoto‚Äôs butt to where you perceive her as an ideal person for everyone around you. Blocked. Push your obsession for her elsewhere.
I was just mentioning side characters that are more interesting than Haru, not characters I wanted in the party.
because you are the character
    That‚Äôs my point
        and you the self insert is a good character
            Thats completely dumb reasoning. Joker has no personality of his own so you have make it yourself. Bland character gets carried by everyone else including the player
And the constant bullying to Ryuji and simping for Ann is better!?
That's just blatantly untrue when the rest of the cast gets full actual dialog to get fleshed out.
    Writing =/= personality. They may be more "deep", but I'm not talking bout that
Based pfp
1 you are jealous, 2 she pegs Ryuji, 3 you are jealous over 2, 4 you are right
    Most mentally sane Makoto fan
        Nahh the only thing I enjoy about Makoto is the bike and Ryuji. Apart from Tae, I would stan 2/3rds of the male characters before I begin thinking about the girls
I was speaking of *my personal* reasoning for putting Haru last on the list.  Further, I acknowledged in my comment that others who don't speak Japanese often play without the English dub, only explaining that I do and gave my personal reasoning.  I did not call you, or anyone, a weeb, or disparage anyone's language choice in any way.  You're reading a lot into this that I did not say or imply, and I feel like this isn't about me but rather I am being projected onto. I am not others, and any issues you have with others does not feel right to pin onto me.
    My apologies, I didn't mean to imply that all applied to you or to lash out. I was similarly trying to describe my experience dealing with native English-speaking fans, but somewhere alonge the way I got too caught up in the venting lol. Sorry.
        Apology accepted, thank you.  Cheers.
Sure but they also made Yu nuke like 700 shadows into oblivion the second he got his persona.

The anime are for-fun fanservice as i see them, instead of serious additions to the characters writing or the plot.
    That was for the Golden anime which was specifically supposed to emulate a new game plus run and show off the new stuff for P4 Golden

The original p4 anime he fights just 2 and it's a bit of a struggle as it show the original journey through P4.
        Oh okay, ill have to check out the regular P4 anime.

I genuinely thought the golden one was all there was for 4.
            Nah there‚Äôs a 20+ episode series that really gives Yu a character all his own and shows how he brings out the best in his team.

It also shows Yu‚Äôs shadow and his crippling abandonment issues
                Hmm. That sounds really good compared to the 4G and 5 ones.
            The Vanilla P4 anime is amazing.  Highly recommend.
Yeah I get that, self inserts are difficult to put a personality onto but I'm big on making the character mine so they always have a consistent character rather than whatever I find funny. It really is just up to how you play games
    The issue is that not only have they given both Makoto and Yu personality in other works, they are good personalities that elevate the interactions and connections with the other characters 

In regards to Ren however they have gon on record and said said giving him personality limits what they can do with him, which is nonsense as him not being allowed to have personality is even more limiting in how scenes can play out, and feels like they are desperate not to say ‚Äúso that the player/watcher can pretend to have friends or a girlfriend‚Äù
        Yeah, I do agree but self inserts are personal preference
            I find they only work when you have a significant amount of dialogue options, very frequently. For example Dragon Age: Origins, Divinity Original Sin 2, or Knights of the old Republic 2.

The way Persona handles it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhow do you want to react to this‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äústoic, sarcastic, or goofy, pick one‚Äù it just feels lazy and jarring to have so little come from the main character who interacts with so many well written characters
                I see your point. I haven't played origins, but I have played Inquisition, and there are lots of dialogue choices, and they definitely have a bigger impact compared to persona 5. They also give you ways to actually build a coherent character with some nuance, like how it's tracks your position on being the Herald of Andraste and religion. I guess I just didn't expect much depth going into Persona 5 and focused on who looked cool. I had heard before playing that the story was kinda shallow, so I guess I focused on who looked coolest
I dunno. Ryuji is more endearing than anything. Mostly because I do enjoy more slapstick goofy characters with a badass streak, Yosuke is in that league too by the way - by way of just being the butt monkey of the Investigation Team along with Teddie and sometimes Kanji.
    I think the difference is that Yosuke is responsible (he has a job), smart, and not as loud and as aggressive as Ryuji.
Strength? Weren't they Chariots?
    Junpei is Magician
        Oh right, my bad.
    Whoops...yeah I meant Chariot.

 I am a little bit disappointed that people. constantly equate Yosuke with Jumpei and Ryuji when Chie is RIGHT THERE

It isn't like Chie joins the game at the end like Haru.....
        It's because Yosuke plays the role of the best friend from the start so people will most likely draw parallels with characters who play a similar role (but then it should be Yukari instead of Junpei lol, she feels much more like a bro than him).

Though ngl, my big reason for not associating Yosuke with Ryuji unless I'm making a comparison that's favorable to Ryuji is because he's wholesome while Yosuke is homophobic (and being bi... I just cannot bring myself to like a homophobic character).
            Yosuke was originally designed to be bi as well, which is where the internalized homophobia comes from. Since they cut the romance he ends up just seeming like an asshole but he does grow and towards the end of the game I feel like he genuinely accepts Kanji and gets over his prejudice.
            I actually agree with you. Female protagonist of persona 3, yes, Junpei is her best friend among the SEES team

But regular male protag? I NEVER got the impression they were friends much less best friends. Yukari, yeah I'm there with you

His existing confidant already kinda hints at that though. 

Like the times he confides in Joker, you can sense the insecurity he has building up till it boils around the Okumura arc.

I assume you wanted more via access to a manual one so it adds more layers on top of the existing main story scenes?
    Yup thats right, and if you do all of that you get special scenes with morgana at the end of the story,  like how you get extra dialogue from lavenza about her love if you do all the twin requests. most confidants explore one topic like ryuji with moving on, yusuke and motivation etc.., insecurity is a much bigger and interesting topic that i would love to be shown in depth with morgana.

This is confirmed by her social link. She says that she wants to know what people like to do for fun. But yet she‚Äôll constantly criticize/ridicule ryuji for his laidback, goofy nature among the group. She doesn‚Äôt know how to not be serious. You don‚Äôt hear or see Ren say half of what she does when he is supposed to be the leader himself, guiding his team.
                That's her role and part of her character for sure, but that's not her entire character.  What I'm mainly pointing out in this discussion is that you saying that she's overrated because the most she has going for herself is her "exagerrated" intelligence and that's what people like about her when there are other aspects that people can gravitate to (like her responsible attitude, caring and helpful side, humbleness to admit her mistakes especially as a senior and student council president, etc.)

That's like saying Ryuji's entire role is the be the bro/comic relief of the group when while that is true, he has more to his character than that (just like you described). Just like you described that there is a reason why Ryuji acts the way he does, there's also a reason why Makoto acts the way she does. I'm mainly pointing out that it's a biased point of view to only selectively described a character to support your argument while you look at the whole picture for the other.
I think you misunderstood. I never said that he isn't a good character or anything. He is just quite over the top.
    He is, but to me, it‚Äôs not fair to say that about him because of everything I mentioned. It‚Äôs not like he woke up and wanted to behave this way. There are major psychological reasons surrounding the way he acts sometimes.
I don't have a particular stan. I like all characters equally, but I picked Makoto as a waifu thinking like "if it was real life" thinking. I guess you can't see my logic since you dislike her, so you're opinion will be biased.
    Except your ‚Äúreal life‚Äù thinking doesn‚Äôt define mine. Your sense of realism and mine are two completely different concepts filled with different expectations/standards. Don‚Äôt push your opinion as fact when it‚Äôll never come close to it. If I‚Äôm biased for having a difference of opinion about a video game character, you‚Äôre especially biased for being up Makoto‚Äôs butt to where you perceive her as an ideal person for everyone around you. Blocked. Push your obsession for her elsewhere.
That‚Äôs my point
    and you the self insert is a good character
        Thats completely dumb reasoning. Joker has no personality of his own so you have make it yourself. Bland character gets carried by everyone else including the player
Writing =/= personality. They may be more "deep", but I'm not talking bout that
Most mentally sane Makoto fan
    Nahh the only thing I enjoy about Makoto is the bike and Ryuji. Apart from Tae, I would stan 2/3rds of the male characters before I begin thinking about the girls
My apologies, I didn't mean to imply that all applied to you or to lash out. I was similarly trying to describe my experience dealing with native English-speaking fans, but somewhere alonge the way I got too caught up in the venting lol. Sorry.
    Apology accepted, thank you.  Cheers.
That was for the Golden anime which was specifically supposed to emulate a new game plus run and show off the new stuff for P4 Golden

The original p4 anime he fights just 2 and it's a bit of a struggle as it show the original journey through P4.
    Oh okay, ill have to check out the regular P4 anime.

I genuinely thought the golden one was all there was for 4.
        Nah there‚Äôs a 20+ episode series that really gives Yu a character all his own and shows how he brings out the best in his team.

It also shows Yu‚Äôs shadow and his crippling abandonment issues
            Hmm. That sounds really good compared to the 4G and 5 ones.
        The Vanilla P4 anime is amazing.  Highly recommend.
The issue is that not only have they given both Makoto and Yu personality in other works, they are good personalities that elevate the interactions and connections with the other characters 

In regards to Ren however they have gon on record and said said giving him personality limits what they can do with him, which is nonsense as him not being allowed to have personality is even more limiting in how scenes can play out, and feels like they are desperate not to say ‚Äúso that the player/watcher can pretend to have friends or a girlfriend‚Äù
    Yeah, I do agree but self inserts are personal preference
        I find they only work when you have a significant amount of dialogue options, very frequently. For example Dragon Age: Origins, Divinity Original Sin 2, or Knights of the old Republic 2.

The way Persona handles it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhow do you want to react to this‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äústoic, sarcastic, or goofy, pick one‚Äù it just feels lazy and jarring to have so little come from the main character who interacts with so many well written characters
            I see your point. I haven't played origins, but I have played Inquisition, and there are lots of dialogue choices, and they definitely have a bigger impact compared to persona 5. They also give you ways to actually build a coherent character with some nuance, like how it's tracks your position on being the Herald of Andraste and religion. I guess I just didn't expect much depth going into Persona 5 and focused on who looked cool. I had heard before playing that the story was kinda shallow, so I guess I focused on who looked coolest
I think the difference is that Yosuke is responsible (he has a job), smart, and not as loud and as aggressive as Ryuji.
Junpei is Magician
    Oh right, my bad.
Whoops...yeah I meant Chariot.

 I am a little bit disappointed that people. constantly equate Yosuke with Jumpei and Ryuji when Chie is RIGHT THERE

It isn't like Chie joins the game at the end like Haru.....
    It's because Yosuke plays the role of the best friend from the start so people will most likely draw parallels with characters who play a similar role (but then it should be Yukari instead of Junpei lol, she feels much more like a bro than him).

Though ngl, my big reason for not associating Yosuke with Ryuji unless I'm making a comparison that's favorable to Ryuji is because he's wholesome while Yosuke is homophobic (and being bi... I just cannot bring myself to like a homophobic character).
        Yosuke was originally designed to be bi as well, which is where the internalized homophobia comes from. Since they cut the romance he ends up just seeming like an asshole but he does grow and towards the end of the game I feel like he genuinely accepts Kanji and gets over his prejudice.
        I actually agree with you. Female protagonist of persona 3, yes, Junpei is her best friend among the SEES team

But regular male protag? I NEVER got the impression they were friends much less best friends. Yukari, yeah I'm there with you

Which furthermore drives me up a wall when those 3 get equated. The only commonality between the three is that they are the first person to join your party
            And not even that, in fact, as I'm pretty sure Yukari joined before Junpei in 3 lmao. They're just the first dudes.
Yup thats right, and if you do all of that you get special scenes with morgana at the end of the story,  like how you get extra dialogue from lavenza about her love if you do all the twin requests. most confidants explore one topic like ryuji with moving on, yusuke and motivation etc.., insecurity is a much bigger and interesting topic that i would love to be shown in depth with morgana.
I mean... it's a suggestion? It's not like she 100% knew it. She dropped a hypothesis to consider.
    My problem is that the hypothesis was flawless at the time. Theoretically, the character wouldn't know they're correct, but hindsight shows it was pretty much perfect.

It's not really the only time, just the one that most took me out of the moment.

Her suspecting you as Phantom Theifs because you had problems with Komoshida. The whole volleyball team had an issue with him. christ, he raped a girl, there's quite a few people who'd want to get him.

She perfectly gets to Kaneshiro by demanding some random thugs take her there. Somehow, it works flawlessly, and she doesn't have something worse than a threat happen to her.

She gets into Kaneshiro's palace, having been in the metaverse for 5 minutes.

Hope I'm not coming off as rude or dismissive. This was my thought process during the game, these could absolutely be problematic to me and not you, just wanted to share something I saw as a flaw during my playthrough.
        Idk, I really don't feel like it's that farfetched or crazy of a hypothesis to make. All of the thieves have constantly been saying "things have been going too smoothly" to indicate how they think there's a possibility all of it is scripted. They know that there's a third party involved because of the black mask too. The hypothesis makes sense imo.

Also, while there are others who hate Kamoshida, you're the only one who had an actual vocal problem about him. Everyone suffering keeps quiet, and those that don't suffer are ignorant usually. Plus, you arrive at the school, and in the span of a month you start beefing with him, he's about to expel you and he confesses to his crimes on the day that you're supposed to get expelled. The coincidences are too great to not suspect Joker and his crew tbh.

The Kaneshiro situation is just dumb luck though. Sure it was "the correct play" in hindsight, but everyone agreed that it was a stupid thing to do and out of character. She even feels bad about it and apologizes. Maybe you can argue they got off too easily, but that's a different issue than Makoto at that point.

Idk, I just never really felt like she was being too big brained in the main story.
See that's a fine flaw to have--but she's treated as if she's being intelligent in the moment, when she's really not.
    You're the only person there though, you can decide if you want to praise her or not.

Plus she says some dumbass shit like "he was dodging all my traps", like there's no way they wanted you to take her seriously. It just shows how she doesn't really get how people work.
        I'll have to double check, but didn't both of Joker's options say that he was impressed or something to that effect?
            You can do that in some cases, but the rest of the team immediately shames you for not praising the Queen. It's like every reaction but praise is a crime
            Well yeah, two of them. But aren't there three? So just don't go for that option and she doesn't get praised.
Because he's well written lmao also no one needs a reason to like a character, I can't understand who likes Yusuke or Haru too much either, but who cares? Why you like or not a character is a matter of personal taste

I like characters that are complex more than simple juvenile ones, that's why ¬Ø‚Å†\‚Å†_‚Å†(‚Å†„ÉÑ‚Å†)‚Å†_‚Å†/‚Å†¬Ø

But sincerely if I give my real opinion about P5 this sub will ban me
Nope. She‚Äôs literally made as the voice of reason and as the leader when she first joins the party. Nothing closed minded about that. It‚Äôs the most defining characteristic that she has in the game. Take that away from her, and people wouldn‚Äôt like her as much as they do now.
    So Makoto's arc and backstory never happened? I just think it's a bit ironic and biased for you to argue that there is more to Ryuji's character than what's in surface (which I agree with) then turn around and simplify another character.
        It‚Äôs not simplifying at all. You‚Äôre acting like Makoto‚Äôs role in the entire game isn‚Äôt to be the intelligent leader. Before the party, she was established as the student council president. This translated especially when the team first accepted her as a member of the Phantom Thieves. She took over the planning and strategizing of everything. She doesn‚Äôt know how to separate her council president status from the group in the real world and in the metaverse. This is confirmed by her social link. She says that she wants to know what people like to do for fun. But yet she‚Äôll constantly criticize/ridicule ryuji for his laidback, goofy nature among the group. She doesn‚Äôt know how to not be serious. You don‚Äôt hear or see Ren say half of what she does when he is supposed to be the leader himself, guiding his team.
            That's her role and part of her character for sure, but that's not her entire character.  What I'm mainly pointing out in this discussion is that you saying that she's overrated because the most she has going for herself is her "exagerrated" intelligence and that's what people like about her when there are other aspects that people can gravitate to (like her responsible attitude, caring and helpful side, humbleness to admit her mistakes especially as a senior and student council president, etc.)
