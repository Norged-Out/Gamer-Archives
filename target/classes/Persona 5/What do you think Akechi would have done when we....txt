[[What do you think Akechi would have done when we...]]


I lost about 15 times in the Okumura boss fight, and it's hilarious to think about how Akechi's meticulous plan was destroyed because Okumura was too strong. It's kind of funny to imagine him tailing the Phantom Thieves through the entire palace only to see them get stomped by Haru's father.

Anyways, what do you think he would've done after the phantom thieves defeated?

I'm thinking he might have to fight Okumura alone because he needs to assassinate him anyway, and then loses too. Yaldaboth's plan being completely ruined lmao. Or maybe he would just report it to Shido and they'd leave the job to the cleaners.

  
EDIT

Omg I completely forgot about the palace self-explosion. Now my headcanon is that Akechi was exploding with us 15 times when I got game over.


Yaldo‚Äôs plan is ruin no matter what unjust game. If one party is out of the game then he‚Äôll speed up ruin
    True - I guess it's even better situation for Yaldy
akechi only need use call of chaos again okumura bots and defeat him easy
    I think there should be limitations to his power tho. We never see him using Call of Chaos in Maruki's palace, and further more I think he could've won in Shido's palace if his power is that good.

Instead of casting it to few lions, he should have just controlled as many shadows as possible in Shido's palace and make phantom thieves exhausted. Or even make them fight alongside him to cast heal and support skills to him.
        I think they nerfed him not being able to use Call of Chaos for gameplay reasons, similar to how despite being a Wild Card, he can‚Äôt swap between Robin Hood and Loki

Akechi literally is the definition of the boss when you fight him vs the boss when you unlock him
            Yes, but even his bossfight is kind of underwhelming. I think he could've done better against phantom thieves if he's powerful enough to solo Okumura.

But I guess gameplay != lore
                He uses CoC in his showtime. Also it's pretty blatant that the thieves barely win the battle with a massive team advantage and a leader who can swap between a dozen different kits alone. That's especially obvious because you need to be basically at the end of the palace to fight him, meaning you had an entire extra palace of power to accumulate.
            If in the very far off future if or when they make a p5 remake, I think it would be cool to have call of chaos as a theurgy-esque attack, similar to that of Aigis‚Äôs Orgia mode
Akechi would intervene in the fight in order to ensure Okumura goes down since letting the palace self destruct might make it impossible to reach his shadow again. Imagine an AU where the phantom thieves meet BM in the wild and have to work with each other before they know it's Akechi.
    He *doesn't* do this, though. We know he's there, because he comes in from in front of you shortly after you leave‚Äîbut if you lose the fight, there's still no sign of him.
        Obviously you aren't gonna reveal him in the game over screen instead of the intended cutscene. I like to think he's hauling ass out of the palace before it goes boom.
            Possibly. I'm not convinced he has time to make it out, much less sight unseen, before the spaceport blows up and we all die.
                I'm curious as to how Akechi leaves palaces in general. He doesn't have a cat car so does he just run to the entrance frantically every time? Maybe a collapsing palace just boots people out and the phantom thieves never got the chance to discover that. 

It's funny to think that he's perched on the rafters (like a crow üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ) during every boss fight and watching the team progressively get bigger and stronger. Like "hm I might be slightly fucked in the future".
                    It's actually really interesting, lmao. Watch the end of Okumura's Palace closely and you'll see it doesn't collapse; it just *looks* like it's collapsing. We get little tremors and puffs of dust, but they correspond to the timer voiceover, and they start *before* we have the Treasure. All we ever see is the timer expire and the spaceport explode, just like if he wins.

Sae's Palace, again, does not collapse‚Äîbecause her treasure is not stolen, and so she never leaves the Palace.

Sometimes people ask why Akechi isn't clued in when Sae's Palace doesn't collapse, but I'm not convinced he'd expect *any* Palaces to collapse. And you can hypothesise various reasons for this.

edit - of course, the other question is, how the fuck does he get out if you *succeed*. Maybe he came in the back way.
                        That's a really interesting point. When he kills someone's shadow the mental shutdown and possible death doesn't happen immediately, so I guess he thinks a palace only disappears if the person is dead.
                            Exactly, yeah. Compare Shido's Shadow, which vanishes abruptly from the Palace leading to its immediate collapse. That, of course, corresponds to Shido's real death in the real world.
            Kind of a funny image of his black knight form running from the destruction like "shit shit shit"
Akechi watching me spend and entire afternoon doing the okumera fight and then being so fed up I go and get fucking psy rings for morgona and ryuji and then after finally fucking defeateding those psy robots I then get one shot by the next round but it's okay I finally got it
Akechi is almost certainly hiding behind the ramp onto the spaceship, so if you all go down, so does he. You also probably die‚Äîthere's no interlude where you get arrested or interrogated, you just cut to the game over poem.

Why he doesn't intervene in the bad ending is left as an exercise for the reader, lmao.

edit - wait, of course you die, it says "thou hast fallen and lost thy life".
I feel like Yaldaddy would just start The Fusion early of that happened
    Perhaps. I always assumed Yaldabaoth needed the Phantom Thieves' downfall for the fusion to happen. I still wonder what his winning conditions were because he could've won at any time if he had started the fusion when Ren wasn't strong enough.
