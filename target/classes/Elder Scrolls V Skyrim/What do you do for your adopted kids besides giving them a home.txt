[[What do you do for your adopted kids besides giving them a home]]





When they ask for a gift I give them a dagger of paralysis, role playing a dad's equivalent to fantasy pepper spray.

"If there is a bad guy, stab him and then run and hide. Now go have fun."

        🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
        Whoops. 

This is some shit that would actually happen
        This is why I don't enchant their stuff with Paralysis.  Just Banish and Turn Undead.
    I give them daggers immediately. Skyrim is a dangerous place. Watching my girls tear into those dummies I’m not too worried about them
    I tend to do a dagger enchanted by fire. Keeps you warm, light in the dark, effective against the undead, and still stab bad man.
Forget which house they're in

        I'll take the trophy
            🏅
    Put them in breezehome, dont upgrade it at all, throw skulls and bloody rags in that pit right when you walk in
I have 2 girls and I like to bring them dolls and dresses. I asked and that’s what they wanted! I used to also give them daggers but my kid accidentally killed me one time when she was practicing on her dummy so I don’t give them weapons anymore 🤣 I never thought of decorating their room tho, that’s cute!!
    It's the enchanted daggers that are dangerous, because of the AOE. You can give them regular weapons no problem. I learned it the hard way when my Sofie killed her bunny with an enchanted shiv I lovingly brought from prison.
        Ohh THAT'S why the pet fox disappeared from my house recently...
        Sofie was the one who killed me too 🤣
    How did she kill you? Was it a modded dagger or something
I'm curious what everyone does for their kids (aside from bringing them a moldy sweetroll from a bandit fort and giving them money). Are there any cute little things you feel like doing?

I like to decorate their bedroom a bit with items from my adventures. Recently I found out how to spawn those ghost globes from Yngol Barrow, so I spawned one in their room cuz, heck, they're the Dragonborn's kids. (This is the beginning stages on my new playthrough, not as cluttered as it usually gets lol)
    Tell us how to make those orbs!
I always have a bunch of sweet roles on me in case they ask for a gift, and I always give them 1k when they ask for an allowance. Kind of makes up for when I inevitably have to tell them to get rid of their pet fox (I hate its labored mouth breathing)
    Yep. They'll bring a bunny eventually, it's the best one.
    I’ve “accidentally” killed multiple of their pets. Then they cry, hate me for like .5 seconds and all is well 🤷🏼‍♀️
My girls get dolls, dresses and daggers. 😂 My boys get clothes, apple pies, books and daggers. Point is, my kids are armed. And educated 😂
I make sure my kids are ALWAYS dressed to the nines. You’ll never catch them in one of those red or green outfits. I also handcraft their daggers and use the highest enchantments I can. My son Blaise has a (superior) dwarven dagger with absorb health, and my daughter Runa Fair-Shield has a (superior) ebony dagger with ravage stamina
In playthroughs in which I do adopt children, I usually bring them dolls and clothing and play tag with them at least once. In a few playthroughs I've also given them allowance and daggers to practice with. I usually never make them do chores because the kids I usually adopt have had hard lives before the adoption so they just get to chill and have fun lives.
    I always pick Sophie. She sells flowers in Windhelm. 
I adopted Lucia from Whiterun my last playthrough.
Sophie asks to play tag.
Lucia has a pet rabbit and begs for allowance every time I see her. She don't know the struggle, lol.
I give em 1000 coin whenever they ask
    Same.
I bring home gifts for the spouse (mod) and kids all the time. Their first gift upon arrival at home is a new outfit, cause I rationalize their old one is reasonably quite dirty and torn up from being homeless or running around working to earn your keep all day. Followed by toys, books, and a dagger or wooden sword. I don't like repeating gifts close together so food gifts like sweet rolls, honey nut treats, apple pies, and apples are quite common, too. If they ask, they get a reasonable allowance depending on my character's occupation. If they bring home a pet I always say yes.

I always rationalize that even though I'm never home, they can have a stable home, a bedroom to sleep in, food to eat, clean clothes, and can learn to read and write now which is way more than they had before even if i'm rarely home. They usually have a spouse and/or steward with them at all times. A dog, too, if its Goldenhills Farm.

I tend to make my characters alchemists and bookworms (easy money plus I myself love reading), so they will be very well educated and have a stable future job as an alchemist. I imagine my character will probably retire to open an alchemy shop and have their then-grown kids working there as assistants. They could even afford to send them all the way to Winterhold to the mages' college if that's what they wanted. Or the bards' college. Whatever they wanted, they're the rich alchemist dragonborn's kids, they're gonna get it.
I go out for Milk.
    Man of culture.
If one of them passes by, I always initiate conversation with them even if I don't have anything to say, in lieu of saying hi. That way it doesn't feel like I'm ignoring them most of the time.
    Yeah, I just give them gifts and money randomly sometimes
I make sure to return to the house after every quest and give them gifts and play games with them
I collect the butterflies in jars and place them in the children’s room, go to markarth buy a dog leave it in the house, when the rabbit followed me home event happens they’ve got all the animal companions that can ask for
    Your adopted daughter sounds like a didney princess
        Yeah well the little ones deserve it, I know they’re only NPC’s but seeing the little orphans around Skyrim really pulls at my heartstrings
    I always put a couple of those jars in their room too. Thanks for reminding me, I should clear out the lighthouse, I think one was there.
        Theirs a green one at the end of the saints and sinners quest too,
I give them the outfits that have the embroidered  hems to make them look more put together and adorable. I give Blaise a wooden sword, and I give Sofie a doll. And I give them 25 gold when they ask for money.
Candy. Loads of candy. Yep. Aiming for some diabetic kids. 😂
Clothes, swords,  toys, treats.

Then I abandon them.  Sometimes for weeks at a time.

I once so completely forgot about them I had no idea why they went to my wedding.  After the wedding, my spouse said "Where shall we live?  You could live with me.  Oh, but you have children."

I felt...not good about myself.
    It's okay. At least they have a home!
Pets, daggers, 100 Septim allowance. I always make sure they're never alone and either have my spouse, or they're in a populated city so there's other kids to play with
Be the dad some of us never had 😂
Wooden swords with super op damage like a million, 
Sweets and books every time I return from the field.
#skyrimjedi
I don't adopt anymore.  The 25% restoration bonus is nice initially, but my restoration skill is usually adequate well before I have the coin sufficient to buy a home.  Between the repetitive dialogue, the nagging for allowance, and the fact that kids will block the doorways of my home, it's an immersion element that just doesn't work for me. 
    "Kids are demanding, annoying, and get in the way of you doing things" is one of the more realistic elements of the game. :)
        Yeah, and for me it adds more random chance of hilarity, like yesterday when I accidentally stole something while my daughter was outside in Riften and she was the first to yell I SAW YOU STEAL THAT before the guards rushed me 😕
            Turn into your werewolf or vampire. Make her run and cry. Little snitch.
                I just took back the 100 gold I'd just given her with console commands
                    ![gif](giphy|7J26fDOzFJqPtO2Vxz|downsized)
What, a home isn’t enough for these parasites?
On one of their beds I pile up statues of dibella, on the other's bed I make a pile of bloody rags and the even rarer torture tools.
They both get sweet rolls whenever I come home.
    I’m afraid of you, also do you not know the connection between dibella and beds?
        Aside from her being sexy, I don't know the connection. I don't actually read all of the books that The Dragonborn reads.
            She’s the goddess of sex, her worshipers are all horny and that one woman in riften worships her by fucking all the men in town and her blessing makes you do more damage to the opposite sex
                So what you are saying is both of my kids are going to be really messed up.
                    Yeah and I’m not sure who would be more scared when they see their beds
we give them monye!
1000 gold whenever they ask, and I always try to keep a handful of trinkets on me in case they ask for a gift. I usually don’t play with them though, the games are kinda tedious, especially when it’s only one other kid. Also whatever pets they want are allowed.
    When I’m leaving I always start a game of hide and seek, they just don’t ’find me’ until I come back the next time for a visit
Yes, because I can
My level is too high to die from most dangerous items but I definitely need to try this
I give my kids a new legendary dagger every time they ask, always keep one on hand. Ebony, glass, elven, only the best for mah babies

Sometimes a doll to practice on
nothing i adopt them for the gifts they give me💀 if rhey ask for a gift i give them sweetrolls
I immediately give them dragon bone daggers and watch them beat the shit out of the dummies
Prevents them from involuntarily participating in the Giant Skyrim Space Program
Maybe it's a sub/dom bdsm thing for them. They aren't related after all.
I like to go to up to the kids who need adopting, offer to adopt them, go through the entire conversation leading them on then when they ask if I’m sure I say no and don’t give them a coin
    This is the other side of the spectrum from me, who uses a mod to move all the orphans into my various homes with guardians assigned to each and 1000 gold in their inventory...
        To be honest I’m just trying to get some angry reactions. I normally adopt Sofie, Lucia, Sissel, Runa or the Dawnstar boy.
A library
Wooden swords for all my children; every single time.
I always bring them gifts like clothes, toys, and food. Also I play tag and hide and seek with them sometimes.
Teach 'em to fight and arm 'em up right.

In point of fact, besides that, I make sure they each get a sweet treat and an apple each day, dolls if they like, dress them fancier than the bullies around town, give them all the cash they ask for - it's otherwise pretty insignificant anyway, and send them outside to play.
I adopted that little girl from Rorikstead after killing her abusive dad- I gave her the dagger I used to do it as a housewarming gift; she practices with the 'Lemkiller' all day long. Warms the heart.
I give them the best daggers I can find (or multiple pretty daggers I find in my travels), new clothes, and dolls (I’ve only ever adopted daughters). I also make sure I keep sweets and other gifts for them when I return from wandering Skyrim. I try to spoil them as much as I can before risking my life ~~graverobbing~~ exploring for extended periods of time
1000 gold
I'm going to be honest, I use a mod to send them back to the orphanage with my murder weapons
I see a lot of daggers below. I always make them legendary wooden swords. Can get around 100 damage.
I give them knives and sweet rolls
Leave them books whenever I can. One of them always gets a pet, so I bring Meeko home, so the other one has one as well. They spend most of their time in Solitude so that there's plenty of children around and Bard's College to learn songs and stories. I do take them to the Lake House as well, but only temporarily as their summer home.
I give them gifts and 1000 septims whenever they ask. I don’t play with them.
I usually give a Dragonbone Dagger, enchanted with Paralyze and Absorb Health.

I also ensure they have lots of books, including Novice Spell Tomes (not Flames).

Also give them spending money, play tag with them, hire a bard, ensure they have a mom, and a steward so they are well looked after. I leave them jewelry with enchantments of Fortify Health, leave them clothes in their dressers, and put dolls in their chests.

I need mods so I can do more, and adopt more kids.
I give them every honey nut treat I find.
When I come home after my adventures I always give them a generous amount of coins
Nothing. I even make them find their own food, or they starve
I spoil the crap out of them, decorate their room as much as I can, arm them, and make a point of spending a day at home every now and then to play tag, chat with them and tuck them in. 

Sometimes I’ll leave their father home with them and take a different follower, so they get some quality time. It’s nice to come home to the girls and Meeko hanging out while Belrand is puttering at the fire.
