|[Launch Discussion Index Thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1ax1lk2/lockdown_initiated_launch_discussion_thread_index/?)|


I just want to say the mods have done a fantastic job I love the idea of just having a separate thread for each chapter and general discussion thread, I remember the FFXVI sub doing something similar what that came out and it worked well

I do have one suggestion though perhaps we should have a deliveries thread as well, I for one am constantly worrying about whether or not the game will be delivered on time 

So just a thread where people could post basic information for example 

Region - Store they ordered from - Delivery status - anything else relevant

That why people could start to get an better understanding of when they should expect a shipping update or a delivery based on what’s happening with other in the same area
It's kinda crazy how much better Barret's facial animations look compared to everyone else.

Every time the camera focuses on him, I'll think "damn this game looks amazing"...and then it pans to someone else with the usual dead-eyed video game character look and it kinda bums me out!
    It's weird that they're so... plastic?  Barrett is such a treat.  He wasn't a favorite of mine in the original but I think he's great here.  Best looking model for sure. 
So damn proud to see those scores. Thoroughly deserved.
    it's bizarre to me how they complain about the story and give it high scores anyway. Game criticism is still confused about what it even is imo.
        Because most game reviewers understand that games are about gameplay more than story.

I noticed a lot of FF fans seem to really struggle to understand this, but it's a reality.

Do you think Breath of the Wild and Sekiro and Elden Ring won GOTY for their stories? They didn't. They won for their gameplay.

No game is going to get bad reviews if the gameplay is phenomenal. Especially when the experience as a whole is so enjoyable. FF7 Rebirth has, by all accounts, great combat, great mechanics, great music, good exploration, fun side content, and great characters. Of course it's going to get good reviews.

No reviewer is going to give a bad review just because they didn't like the story as much. They might give a *less* good review, but not an actually bad one.

Game criticism isn't confused about what it is. You are confused about what it is. A game should not be reviewed like a movie or a book, it should be reviewed as a game, which means gameplay is enormously important.
            I play final fantasy games for the storylines and the characters. The gameplay is 2nd for me
                Well that's you. And I'm sure there are other people who feel the same.

But a game reviewer would be failing at their job if they gave a game a bad review just for not liking the story when every other aspect of the game is excellent.

Games are defined by gameplay, that's why we call them video *games*. If you want story and characters you can get that from books, movies, TV shows, etc... It's not exclusive to video games. But if you want gameplay, that's something you can only get from a video game. 

You can have a game without a story (Tetris) or almost no story (Mario) and it would still be a game. It could even still be an excellent game. But you literally cannot have a game without gameplay. Gameplay is the single defining trait of what makes a game.

It's also usually the biggest part of the experience. For example, FF16 had about 11 hours of cutscenes total. Now let's be super generous and say Rebirth, which is a 100+ hour game if you do everything, has double what FF16 had and therefore has a whopping 20 hours of cutscenes (highly doubtful). Well even in that case, it would still mean 80% of the experience was gameplay.

And that is why reviewers usually prioritize gameplay. There is nothing surprising or unprofessional about them giving it good reviews despite having some issues with the ending. They're looking at the experience as a whole, and in particular they're looking at what is the biggest and most defining aspect of the game, which is gameplay.

It's cool if you only or mostly care about story, but it just wouldn't make sense for reviewers to treat a game that way. A game is not a book or a movie, you can't discount the fact that the very thing that makes it a game by definition is its gameplay.
        > it's bizarre to me how they complain about the story and give it high scores anyway

adding on to other responses to this, a lot of reviewers loved a lot of the story and characters while criticizing the ending. it doesnt seem like most of them dislike the story as a whole
        I imagine with a game like this you could absolutely despise the changes they are making to the storyline but still review it highly when viewed objectively because it is a technically brilliant game with a (mostly) coherent and compelling story.
Everybody

Go to Google and type in Chocobo, click the little icon at the bottom
    Ty for this. Needed something to help me get through work today.
    Hahaha amazing! You can spam the heck out of the button too
Just made it to Kalm and... Jesus, this town was only one screen in the original! If the rest of the game has this much effort put into it then we're in for a treat.
After putting about 14 hours into the game so far I can honestly say it would be hard to go back to the combat of part 1. Launching Tifa into the air with synergy attacks against airborne opponents is beyond satisfying
    I haven’t used Tifa much yet. Been playing with the default party haha cloud, Aerith, and red xiii
in my hopes that squeenix will see this, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE CHADLEY TALK LESS. I JUST WANNA MAKE MATERIA AND GET TO TYE COMBAT SYSTEM AND HE WON'T STOP TALKING TO ME ABOUT RANDOM THINGS! xD
    I love that Mai is even more aggressive than Chadley, and even he starts getting annoyed about it.
Does Chadley get less annoying? Just about 100% completed ch2 but I’ve found the constant interaction with him on the little device and him popping in for every single open world discovery is getting a bite tiresome already. He’s almost more of a main character than the rest of the party
    I'm in chapter 4 and so far he has remained just as annoying. I can't imagine how they thought having him pop up to talk to you about anything and everything every 5 minutes was a good idea.
        Its the "Current Game Design" meme where your UI is constantly cluttered with Chadley talking to you, even invading your controller to make sure you can't escape him.
        Damn that’s disappointing. I was hoping Ch2 was a bit over the top because it’s introducing the concept to you and all the different types of discoveries but holy hell do I hit this dweeb already haha
    Please post anybody who finds a way to mute the little creep.
    I'm at the end of chapter 4 and he never stops.  It's so obnoxious.  I'd rather slow walk through boxes.  I assume it's always this way.  I dunno why they thought he was interesting enough to do this with, nor why they think players need this much hand holding.  
        I’m with ya. I just hit Ch5 and I don’t understand why they thought people would want him as the main character. Deal with Sephiroth? Rise up against Shinra? Nah have teenager boy shouting in your ear every 5 seconds telling you what to do while his sister monologues useless info during combat

Love the game. Hate those two
Does anyone else feel obligated to pet the chocobo chick after repairing every chocobo stop?
    Every single time!  I gotta earn that plume!
Queen's Blood is...like really good?? Like I want to play it as a standalone game?
    I didn't think I'd want to play it much but after spending 20-30 minutes watching a quick guide and reviewing my deck, I'm hooked. Already cleared the first area of opponents, at least I think so, and I want to advanced to the next area if only to play more
    Petition for QB online!!
Really wish I ordered the physical copy for the random chance it would get delivered early.
    I've done that before and never got mine early. I think the chance of you being one of the lucky few is slim. I even had a copy arrive late once so as much as we wish we were playing early at least you know at 11:00 pm cst on Wednesday your unhealthy obsession for the foreseeable future begins. Monday, Tuesday, and half of Wednesday are going to feel pretty long I imagine.
    There's also a chance it would get delivered late.
I can't believe they included a whole open world RPG with Queen's Blood
My first gripe was the confusion over the “Upgrade Weapons” menu, which I saw other people mention. I understand weapon upgrades passively now, so why not call it “Weapon Upgrades” instead of using a verb to imply you can upgrade them akin to Remake?

I could overlook that, but I’ve just realised the “Party” option on the menu doesn’t actually let you arrange your party, no, you need to go to “Combat Settings” for that and then “Edit Party”. Instead the “Party” menu just shows you an outline of each character and their loadout, so why not call it “Stats” or “Characters”?

A much more minor one, but I’ve also very rarely played a JRPG where the top item in the menu isn’t by default “Items” or “Inventory”, instead it’s over halfway down the list. For some reason “Item Transmuter” is at the top, so basically a crafting menu instead.

It feels so strange to have such a polished game have some confusing UI design decisions like this. It’s not an issue, just feels out of place in quality compared to the rest of the game.
    I don’t understand how it’s 2024 and the games industry seems to just keep reinventing UI. We’ve had decades of amazing examples of UI design. Not talking art style, but I would have expected good UI design to be ubiquitous at this point.

He’s here folks. Statue is incredible.

Also can confirm that the discs are labeled properly on the US version.
    Is he 19” of 21”? I have a space I may need to tweak for him and I’m also waiting for mine to arrive to make an unboxing video for you all! Thanks!
Can we please get a Queens Blood mobile game? I would play the shit out of that.
Does anyone think the audio mixing is a bit off? The music/SFX are way too loud for the dialgoue by default. There are times when I've missed entire intel briefs from Charley or Mai because I can't hear what they're saying over the music.
    I put down the music/sfx to 6 and I have dialogues up to 10 just so I can hear more clearly.
    Oh definitely. Immediately thought this when a QB match ends and the person says ... something ... but the music is just gongin.
Took 5 hours but I 100% completed grasslands. Now working on the second zone. 

Anyone else 100% each zone before moving on?
     I am 24 hours in and I just finished 100%ing Grasslands and 2nd area. Currently in Chapter 4. I actually enjoyed 95% of it too. 

 But I am thinking it might be time to continue the main story for at least a couple chapters because I am currently 2 levels above the recommended level for the story.
You may hate this but I’m the kind of guy who likes to play through these games with a guide. I used to buy the physical books for big rpg releases. Is there anything like that for rebirth? Will the major guide sites have theirs ready for launch?
    Unfortunately those days are long gone.  The closest thing you'll get is the Remake Ultimania, which did have a guide.  But that was released well after release, and only in Japanese.
    IGN does a few minor guides upon release. it usually doesn't take "too long" for someone to post a guide to gamefaqs. there were a few different ones i used for my 2nd playthrough of Remake. here are the ones i enjoyed:

also, who cares. don't let anybody shit on the way you like to play the game. it's a single player, offline game. enjoy it how you want to man.
Holy Hell, I’m so excited!!! Beat Crisis Core, Remake and Intergrade last few weeks, ordered Advent Children on 4K, and bought a lot of really good weed. This game was such a huge moment in my childhood, pushing into 40 now and to see the world in this detail, these characters deepen, the story becoming more complex and fleshed out, I’m just beyond thrilled . (Remember being a kid and beating Emerald Weapon without the Underwater Materia, and my friend freaking out, being such a tense battle, hahaha)

https://i.redd.it/zf5k3oshxdlc1.gif
    Dude, I am the same as you. 37 years old, just best remake and intergrade last 4 weeks. I played FF16 before, but I should have played crisis core like u lol.

This game is such a massive part of my childhood too, it’s crazy. So excited to play part 2 in 20 mins
https://preview.redd.it/nud1vvu9vlmc1.jpeg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06d9a37e368ac9f6de5863c4993708ba506b5395

Is it just me, or is Cloud always taking Aerith and Tifa, and leaving Barret behind with the dog ?
    Two Girls One Cloud is my usual party setup too. 

Barret and Red feel like they belong together. Their deep love of the planet forms a bond. 

This game has made me realize how superfluous all the other characters are.
My only complaint after 21 hours 


For such a beautiful game, this sure has some shitty photomode. I would understand not having any poses like spiderman or cyberpunk but the camera is fucking shit.



We have literally no liberty to do anything. I'm  guessing they are being so restricted with it so the internet doesn't get flooded with tifa's breasts or ass or something. I really like taking screenshots but it is really difficult to take a good one with it
Anyways rant over
    Yeah ikr I was trying to take some good shots of Tifa’s badonkadonks in Costa del Sol but no dice
[A message](https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1760605439698591859?s=19) from Nomura on streams and videos containing spoilers.
If you're worried about spoilers, stay off Youtube at the moment.

Just got spoiled by some muppet "content creator's" thumbnail.
    I mean, I’d stay off most places on the internet if you’re worried about spoilers! I remember getting spoiled due to an Amazon review once.  

I’ve just kind of made my peace with spoilers. They’re going to happen no matter how hard I try to avoid them, spoilers ultimately don’t ruin the gameplay or journey!
I've never been much of a competitionist in games but the grasslands is changing that... I dunno if it's gonna hold up throughout the entire game but I'm enjoying going for everything right now.


what happened to party banter in this game? I am at start of chapter 3 with aerith and tifa inside the cave and they did not talk at all outside cutscenes. This wasn't the case in part 1 tho and the party was really chatty.
I made 5 attempts at the first piano mini game and all of them were graded as a C.
I made the mini game "harder" and first time got a B, and then second attempt got an A. 

Anyone struggling with it, increase the speed. Seems to have worked for me, make it so that as soon as you see the key light up you have to hit it. When it is slower you have to try to time it and thats what made it hard
    I feel like the key is knowing the songs.  This is my favorite mini game because I love so much of the music.  
Do yourself a favor and play the story in missions on Graphics mode.
    Make me.
I just came here to say I will pet ALL the chocobo chicks. Cute ass lil motherf***ers!!!!
I did not expect this game to have such good fucking JAZZ MUSIC, goddamn... queen's blood theme has me groovin'
So far my biggest complaint is about the mini-games. Two specifically. The piano can just fuck right off. But the fucking crunches. Jesus Christ. They took the most bullshit mini game from Remake and somehow made it worse. I find as I get older, my coordination is diminishing when it comes to video games. And bullshit like these mini games makes me feel so fucking bad about myself. Especially when they lock actual equipment behind them and not just trophies.
    Oh they made me rage. The decision to use the haptic feedback was just a headscratcher imo, had to disable it after my 5th or 6th try as it was starting to kill my wrists.

Fuck those half trigger pulls they threw in there too.
    I had to turn off the haptic triggers for the crunches.. made it 10x easier
    What's bad about it out of curiosity? I'm not there yet but have seen that complaint a lot and some of these minigames have annoyed me.
im so tempted to just buy the digital even though i preordered a physical deluxe. getting fomo from everyone preloading
    Haha, same. I got Remake early so I wasn't expecting issues here, but here I am at the end of the working day before release day, with no updates on my order beyond "Awaiting Fulfilment" since 2 weeks ago.

I expected it wouldn't arrive early on release day so I'm still working tomorrow, but I booked Friday and Monday off work. First time I've booked time off work for a game in many years. If it doesn't arrive tomorrow I'll be very tempted to buy the digital version too, but spending an extra $70 for the sake of a few extra days playing does seem silly...
    I did this with ffxvi. Dont do it, it wont be worth it I guarantee you

Youll likely get it a day late at max. If you ordered day one shipping and it says label created itll likely update today.
    >ease my CE preorder. I

me too. My eta is monday! I wanna play this weekend fuck waiting.
Anyone notice the really bad ghosting? Playing in Graphics Mode and turning the camera around trees and by water it’s like super bad.
Does anyone else find guarding and guard counters really hard? There’s so much visual noise it’s really hard to tell when something is attacking. Also lots of fiends have attacks that hit in multiple small instances of damage. Do I need to counter all of those individually? 

Also im kind of confused since the guard key also brings up the duo abilities. Am I actively guarding when that menu is up?
Mods is it possible to refresh these threads daily now that the game is out so new posts can get engagement? The sub feels like it’s dead on launch weekend which is a drag.
This game is incredible, Fort Condor however can suck a big fat one. This isn't fun at all.
    I gave up and moved it to easy for that.
Camera when riding a chocobo is terrible. it should be more up so you can see better. How did no one noticed this?
    generally camera is out of place, durning walking/fight it can also stuck behind tree/rock.
    Camera is too close in general and at a weird angle legit my only problem w the game
I love the game for most part but I absolutely hate how weapons are levelled. In Remake you could make Buster Sword good, but in this it's just useless.
So people aren’t liking the game? I’m loving it but I’m only in Chapter 2. It seems like most people who aren’t loving it are already pretty far in the game at chapter 8+ so maybe there’s a burnout factor from playing too much too fast?
    My biggest criticism of the game is the pacing. I'm on chapter 10 right now. There's way too many mini games that lock rewards and gear behind them. I do like the mini games but again there's just way too many and then you're pressured into doing them which makes the story come to a screeching halt. The thing I like the most about the game is the combat, and the character writing.
        I keep hearing that and now I'm actually dreading progressing further into the game. Why the fuck would they make mini games mandatory for story progression and locking the bulk of items to them? Just pointless padding but that's just modern day gaming in a nutshell.
    I’m disappointed, but I’m still enjoying it. It’s too difficult at times, and the side quests suck. There’s too much crap on the map, and pointless things at that. Plus, there are too many bad mini games.

I expected it to be amazing
    There's a very significant shift that begins to creep in around chapter 5, where the pacing slows and things start to revolve more and more about mandatory minigames. 

This eventually reverts back, but the whole middle chunk of the game is minigame central and I think a lot of people are turned off by that.
Did you know that you can switch to using Tifa to play the piano? I just discovered that by accident when I pressed the ‘start’ button and saw an option to change performers. And if you’re having difficulty with the piano, try adjusting the speed. For example, ‘Tifa’s Theme’ seems to be best played at speed 3 and ‘On Our Way’ is best at two or three. 

For whatever reason the default setting seems to be off, though I have heard that this can differ based upon what tv you have; however, I don’t know that for sure. But I definitely have much greater success when playing at a higher speed setting. As someone who has loved the music since 1997 there seems to be a disconnect, to my ear, between the song and the notes that you have to hit at the default setting.
Avoid IGN they’re spoiling things as usual in article headlines
I’m in chapter 6 and I just realized there’s a difference between Synergy Abilities and Synergy Skills. Had never used a Synergy Skill until just now. Nice going
    I’m just starting chapter 10 and rarely use them. I just forget they’re there!
HOLD!!! HOOOOOOLD!!!

Metacritic updated to 77 reviews a second ago before going backwards, which it usually does, and it was still at 93.

**UPDATE:** It happened! Metacritic broke through 100 reviews and it's STILL at 93!!! This is insane! I deleted my other comments because I didn't just want to spam a string.

https://preview.redd.it/12bbsssle5kc1.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&s=149e64d6742477c7714c7364a79ea5eaab093206
    Sadly 92 now. But still pretty high score!
Be careful on YouTube, someone already released the ending...

Well fuck I got recommended a "REBIRTH ENDING" with spoiler thumbnail video. Dear gods what am I supposed to do with my life until I get and finish this fucking game

I'll just install a "hide thumbnail" extension and stick with my usual channels
I am at chapter 8 and it kind of bothers me how much the devs feel the need to pad out gametime.
>every time I have to push a cart around

>everything you need to do to gain access to beachwear

>having to find food for a certain chocobo

Game isn't terrible by any means but these issues bring it down a bit.
    Yeah, I noticed the blatant padding as well in some areas. I don't mind it so far because it's usually short enough to not bother me, but I do notice when I'm doing things for the sake of just being busy but not really achieving anything.
    I don't mind the quests, but my big complaint are these weird sequences that consist of pushing carts, doing the L2+R2 thing, plugging in cables, etc. I just don't understand how someone can think these sequences are fun. The game would be so much better if all of these were removed.
        I think its to sort of involve your self in the world its basically puzzles? but not really.
            Yeah I think that's the intention, but for me it does the opposite. It just annoys me.
CE just -actually- shipped from NV, after they'd given me a tracking number on the 4th. It says 'Arriving on the 29th.'

Godspeed, friends.
    Mine just updated as well and says the 29th too! Gives me time to prep so I can film and upload the unboxing on YouTube!
    My tracking number just updated too and it’s giving me a March 1 delivery date 😭
        Cast haste!
Does dynamic difficulty go above normal difficulty? As in I assume you prob start on easy in it but can you advance past normal difficulty so the game’s enemies are hard?
    it just scales the enemies to your level so you can’t over level content
Is it just me, or does Rebirth look worse than Remake?. I don't have a 4K TV, so maybe that would make a difference. I just replayed Remake before the release of Rebirth, and, in terms of graphics and lightning, or specially the faces, I think Rebirth look worse than Remake!?. It's true Rebirth is like an open world game, with so much more stuff to do and explore, and Remake is just pretty linear, but still.
    Yes it does, Square Enix said there will be patch for that  
[https://twitter.com/Genki\_JPN/status/1764105144260817209](https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1764105144260817209)
PSA: if you use Twitter and follow gaming channels, maybe take a break until you beat the story. Fucking IGN posting half spoilers again
We should all band together and ask the devs to get rid of the sit-ups minigame. it's pure BS
    I beat it with a 50 and then fell right at the last second.  Luckily it counted right before.  That and Fort Condor are so so so bad. 
18 hours in and only just got to under junon. 
I think i need to tone down the completionist mindset right now or I'll get drained, but I'm loving this game so much.
I haven't played the OG yet, and going from mostly slums in Remake to this whole planet is insaneee.
    Yeah right after Junon is when I stopped caring for completionist and decided to leave it as my endgame. There was a particular part where they theow two regions at you back to back with not story inbetween and I was like nahhhh
    I agree with you. I think if you try and be a completionist throughout, it really takes away from the pacing of the story. I think I'm going to do a few of the important things in each region and leave the rest for me to catch up on at the end of the game.

With that being said though, are you walking everywhere on foot or something? I did absolutely everything (as far as I know) in Kalm, Grasslands, Junon Region, and Under Junon and I think I was at like 14-15 hours as I entered Upper Junon. And I am not a fast player by any stretch. Dont forget you can fast travel to any of the event locations you've already visited!
So, tell me, what's a good not-blind playthrough to watch? Everyone says max dood, but he just fucking sucks as a player and literally doesn't read the goddamn user interface.

Someone who doesn't rush through it, but not clueless. Hopefully.
    Oh man if you think Max sucks then don't watch the ProJared stream lol. 

I like Jared for his reactions to the story beats, but my god his gameplay is just the worst sometimes.  

It took him until maybe junon before he figured out how to use basic synergy abilities and is now in costa del sol but STILL doesn't understand cloud's ranged/air move-set.
    That's actually a fair criticism of Max, I love how much he loves FF7, but I learned during the Elden Ring playthrough that he is really bad at RPGs, his FGC mind just wants to fight things as soon as he can and spend hours doing it which is fine, but annoying when he is ignoring things that can make it so much easier for him.

That said I don't know if I have a great answer, but I've been watching Rogersbase mainly for his reactions to the story, but he seems pretty competent at the game based on me skipping through the VODs.
god its so good, eight hours in, still just soaking in the grasslands
Whoever made the decision to put stealth missions in the game, should never work in the industry again.


Other than that, great game so far. 
    The problem isn't stealth mini games, the problem is that it's a bad minigame and you're forced to interact with it
TEN FROM IGN JAPAN

[https://twitter.com/IGNJapan/status/1760666072079040676](https://twitter.com/IGNJapan/status/1760666072079040676)
I don't remember if REMAKE was like this but I liked being able to hit R1/L1 to cycle between materia types
    It was not.
Does anyone know if Rebirth is chapter based like the remake?
    Yes it is.
Wanted to share this episode of [The Besties](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6r1gaEFaElT3iFXUqqJ5iX?si=_eRHRWybRIi9GDMRF29EiA), which is a really thoughtful review that does not spoil story at all. They don't even touch on anything beyond chapter 3/4, barely describe any narrative beats, and they do give in-depth impressions of the gameplay and open world.
Collector's edition finally shipped, overnight shipping, label created and estimated delivery is the 27th, expecting the date to change to release day once it actually starts moving though
    Now I wish I got the Collector's Edition and wasn't a broke bitch. :,)
Also finally got a tracking update that my CE will be here by Friday. 

I live 8 hours from Vegas, where it's shipping from, and it will somehow take a full day to get here. Annoying, but at least it's finally moving.
People who bought a physical copy, how long did it take to install? Can you start playing as soon the 2nd disc is inserted, or does it need more data to install before it’s playable at that point

Edit

About 25 mins for disc 1 to finish and day one update to install. It’s playable as disc 2 installs.
Important EDIT: You can skip all cutscenes AFTER the intro and be there in minutes. The introduction starts with the same CGI cutscene as the demo, BUT it has a couple of new scenes and a playable section.

If you're wondering how to skip the first chapter from the demo, don't worry. It's not broken. You won't get the option until after your first battle going up the mountain with Her.

CTRL+F keywords: demo skip, chapter skip, saved data.

Edit 2: Also it only skips up until where you go to the mansion to look for Him, and you won't get the items found during the section between here (so missing wind materia amongst some potions iirc?). Unsure if you should skip the cutscenes coming up until the demo section is over. They might've changed stuff. I'm typing this as I play. Hopefully someone with good memory can let us know in the comments below whether some scenes were changed so we can know if we can safely skip until the end of the demo or not.

(uhh semi spoiler from demo, but just shows the message you'll get and location) https://imgur.com/VX3hTuO
Anyone else here that ordered from the Square Enix store have no updates at all from UPS? I’m in NY and my tracking number says “We have your package” as of February 25th with no further updates yet it’s supposed to be delivered by tonight at 7? UPS site says it’s “on the way” with no updates either. Reports from others are that some people’s statuses have delayed until next week. Some have had their updates disappear with no ETA at all. 

What the fuck is this shitshow? This is completely unacceptable. Some people are concerned that their packages had been stolen. The common denominator is this UPS store in LV.
    Mine has not moved from the Vegas UPS store since the 25th when they “received” it. My delivery date was supposed to be by last night at 7pm here in Ohio. That did not happen and my delivery date has now shifted to Monday. I opened a ticket with Square because the expectation for spending $300 on a game is that I can play it on release day. So this is ridiculous. I’m going through them first as their customer service is better than UPS so depending on their answer I’ll file a claim with UPS after.
    I just called UPS, new estimated date is march 5th even though March 1st was on an email they just sent last night.  They have nothing they can say except "its in transit"  Also stuckin Vegas
What's the deal with having the option to walk or chocobo when fast travelling? What difference does it make?
    As far as I can tell it only affects whether you spawn on foot or on a chocobo. But yeah, if that's the case it seems like a pointless step.
        not really pointless, if you travel to a city/area you need to walk at spawning on a chocobo is needless r1 to get off.

Spawning in an area in the middle of the map you need a chocobo for it would require you to call, wait for it to arrive then hop on it before you go anywhere
    So far as I can tell I think it's just an option for what you spawn in the new location with. So if you choose chocobo you'll arrive and be on your chocobo as opposed to on foot. A small difference I think as it only saves you a few seconds of calling out your chocobo anyway.
I just need a place to say this: the soundtrack is freaking stellar. So many songs that hit just right, whether the trap remix of the chocobo theme, or the emotional pieces. The music elevates this game to another level, for me.
    Fully agree, this games ost needs to be in talks for best of all time imo
Christ, the piano shit is hard. How the fuck am I supposed to flick the stick that quickly in such precise directions? It’s impossible. I feel like the only way to be good at this is to do the songs over and over until you memorize most of it. Might as well learn to play piano IRL.
    I'm not very good at it, but it seems like you gotta think of it more of a tap than a full push. You gotta be gentle on the piano keys, not slam your fingers down.
I beat the demo multiple times and one thing always struck me as absolutely fucking stupid.  This time I got out my stopwatch on my iphone. 

The dumb-fuck Mayor of Nibelheim has LITERALLY a minute with his shotgun aimed at sephiroth in point blank range with two other fucking idiots with guns.  None of them shoot.  I understand the general principle of cloud being a helpless witness, but this is absolute trash directing.  A fucking minute and not a shot taken.  That isn't characterization of the mayor as timid....That's dumbass storytelling.

Please tell me i'm not the only one that thought this was fucking ridiculous.  I love this game, but come on. It's plot armor bullshit.
    he wouldnt have died anyway but i agree, its tropey and shit
        Speaking of demo, in tifas room for the flashback, is the music page supposed to not be there?
            Let me clarify, it was there for the demo but I don't see it in the main game
    That one scene is, objectively, extremely poorly directed. From having you limp through the town incredibly slowly, to forcing a detour while you're already oh so incredibly slow, to that section that's borderline comical it is so stupid to look at.

For a mercy, (very nearly) EVERYTHING FUCKING ELSE about the game is stellar and I have seen absolutely nothing even REMOTELY that badly paced further ahead.

It's a shame they fumbled such an iconic scene, even I can think of several ways to make it much more engaging and immersion without dragging (LITERALLY!) quite as much, and I'm a dumbapple.
        Being forced to limp through that section made me want to throw my controller at the screen 😭 like goddamn man I thought they lessened the padding. Love the game so far but after chapter one I actually stopped for the night.
youtube is a litteral no go zone.  trying to watch random vids to pass the time and there are spoiler vids uploaded on my reccomendations.  ugh.
maximum stack of 99 for item materials is really not enough, it kind of sucks when some items I'd like to craft in bulk use 10+. The cushion is done right with the amount of materials needed but everything else just doesn't make sense to try and bulk craft.
Saw an article about players bullying Chadley. Good. Can't so much as scratch my fuckin ass without him popping up. See a radio towe- \*Slow down, pull out phone\* "Hello! Would be great to get that tower!" thanks.. See a new enemy up ahea- \*Slow down, pull out phone\* "Hello! Battle that for my World Intel!" was about to.. Look at a fucking rock on the ground? "Hello!" He's annoying af. Chocobo mechanics are also jank af, R1 to demount.. sometimes. Then accidentally get back on cause he gets in front of you. And yeah the performance mode in this somehow looks worse than remake 4 years ago. Not quite living up to the price tag tbh.
So, how's everyone coping? Just a few days away now. I'm struggling to play anything, I've been avoiding any info left and right. It's stressful haha
    I'm beating remake on hard and getting as any trophies as I can until my preorder from best buy shows up.
So honestly Im not the biggest graphics guy there is. The game is great. But I gotta say… it looks really ugly sometimes. The texture work is not great. Its like the door “controversy” from Remake but like… for a lot more things. The rocks/cliffs are especially really bad, it looks like straight ps2 graphics anytime its close to the camera. 

Im guessing its due to the huge open world nature but i cant lie its a bit disappointing.
This games pacing is all over the place, they're trying to say the world is in dire straits but the story keeps getting pushed aside to do random bull shit for an hour. I understand breaking tension but it happens too often and lasts way too long.
    Thats kind of a thing with most ff games imo. 10 had a ton of random things you could fuck off doing despite the game being in “world is ending” plot mode for like 40 hours. As much as I love FF stories, the pacings are often all over the place. 

Tbh I find that to be a criticism of most very long RPG games. As much as I enjoyed BG3, the pacing during act 3 was a fucking ride lmao. I bring that up because it’s a recent example where I felt what you are feeling
    Oh man, in Remake that warehouse ghosts chapter was one of the worst pacing decisions of any game. We're like "OH NO THE TOWER IS BEING ATTACKED HURRY", but then we take a long pause to learn the story of the ghosts in some random warehouse with slow somber scenes?
93 on Metacritic....
I ordered my deluxe edition for physical pick up from Best Buy. My CC was finally charged yesterday and my order status has changed to "Preparing for pickup on Thursday."

It's been a long wait, and I can't believe it's just a few more days until release day!
[deleted]
    my deluxe is still awaiting fulfilment , just received a text from DPD about a delivery and im not expecting anything else
    \*UPDATE\* as per my previous post I now have full tracking via DPD on a package, no info from square enix site yet ( still says awaiting fulfilment ) Is shipping via  chronopost out of chilly mazarin france to DPD Ireland.
    Same, im so anxious

I read some ppl received remake without any notice from squareenix...
Anyone in the US order the deluxe edition from Amazon and still waiting for even an estimated delivery date? Saw a while back that lots of people in the US were getting delivery date updates around 2-3 weeks ago but I still just have "order received"
Bestbuy started packaging my deluxe edition today. They also took my payment. If you pre ordered from Bestbuy, it might be a good idea to check your order.
Best Buy US has updated to "Arriving By Thursday". Via FedEx for those wondering about the Carrier.
You’ll get a prompt to skip Nibelheim section if you’ve played the demo when you start the mountain section. Just in case anyone looks for the skip button like I did.
Ugh Best Buy says “Packaging your item” still. 😠 It says “We’ll ship it Tomorrow”. Does that mean I’ll get it tomorrow or it is sent to the currier tomorrow?
    Samesies. I'm hoping they ship today. If not, i can wait.
My order page on Square Enix store suddenly no longer lists the tracking information, wtf
    Same, but I got a UPS tracking # in email. It originally showed March 1, but now it's showing March 4...
Anyone here bought the Collectors edition and not getting it for days after release? Happened last time and happening again. It just feels so awful...
    Mine's not arriving till Friday.

>Happened last time and happening again. It just feels so awful...

I think they had a pretty good excuse last time, given that the world had an unprecedented complete shut down that month.
Collectors edition ordered directly from SE in the UK, like everyone else I've been stuck in Awaiting Fulfilment for weeks. Was getting worried today that it still hadn't shipped the day before release.

Got an email that it had been shipped late this evening, DPD updated with tracking, and it's due to arrive around midday tomorrow.

I was starting to lose faith but everything is fine! Time to become a hermit for a few days.
1.5 hours of work to go.... 🙃 This is getting difficult.
    12h to work to go.....
Mine isn't coming until Friday. Was VERY tempted to also buy it from the PS Store just so I could have it today but I decided against it. Have fun tonight soldiers!!
I can’t play until later. Whose idea was it for me to have a job and responsibilities?
    I feel you, I have a late evening shift today and tomorrow so I probably won’t get chance to really sink my teeth into it until saturday
Has anyone else been having error messages when trying to have their saved data recognised for the bonuses?

I had my Remake and Intergrade save files recognised fine and got the summon materia bonuses, but haven’t had my Rebirth Demo save data recognised.

In the Demo, I definitely finished the Nibelheim chapter, and unlocked the Junon chapter. If anyone has figured out a fix I’d be so grateful if you could share please!

In the full game I literally played through all of Nibelheim again waiting for the prompt to skip and it never came up…… if I can’t skip I’d at least like that bonus accessory 🥺
    Similar but different! Mine recognized the demo clear data but not the Remake or DLC clear data and it's giving me the 'No eligible saved data is found' error. What gives??
        Same
    same :(
Anyone else’s CE still stuck in “We have your package” with no other movement for multiple days? I’m losing it over here lol
    Same status since Sunday, ETA is still tomorrow
    I’ve got the CE from the square store. Normal shipping. Last update was the 25th that they received the package in Nevada and it’s in transit 5 days now. “Arriving today by 7pm”. 

I have a coworker with the same exact situation. Since I want to film the unboxing, he will give me his if it comes in early and I give him mine if it comes in late. He got it digital too so he can play on time.
        This is the exact situation I’m in. Last update was the 25th that UPS has the package in Nevada. I’m well far away from Nevada and says it’ll be here by 7pm today. We’ll see I guess…. Good luck to you
***FIXED***
For anyone experiencing the issue where the game can’t find any of your demo saved data, I figured out how to fix it. go to your console storage save data and delete the Final Fantasy seven rebirth save data (NOT the demo save data). Reopen the game, go to the bonus section and check again, and it should work.
Does the quality of cutscenes and conversations between characters change depending on performance / graphics mode or is it standard?
Just so y'all know, the Chadley towers are 100% optional to use. Everything they unveil can be found organically if you'd rather it not mark them on the map for you. I thought battle intels were the only exception, but nope; you can find those organically too.

....................................Great game btw.
4 hours in and loving it so far
Has anyone noticed Vanille (FF13) hanging out in Kalm?
    Lol I noticed her too
I’m 9/9 in queens blood but I still feel like I’m just blagging it. I don’t feel skilful at all. Also deck building is ridiculously difficult.
    Deck building is definitely hard. I think you are meant to lose queens blood more often than not. At a certain point they give you “queens blood puzzles” (basically give you 3 cards and tell you to win the board in 3 turns) and it made me think about the game a little more. There’s probably a lot of depth to get out of the game but I’ve just been using the same strategy and hitting reset if I think I’ll lose
It’s really annoying how slow it is to drag objects. Why can’t it be twice as fast?
Just wondering if anyone else has noticed references to other games in the dialogue, whether passive or game centered. So far I've had what I believe are Pokemon, ratchet and clank, God of war,  and assassin's Creed,
    I mean tbf Assassin's Creed's popularising of the reconnaissance tower concept is one of the biggest tropes in modern gaming. The director of the first two Assassin's Creed games has even jokingly apologised for all the recon towers in every single open world game.
They nailed the color palette
Chadley becoming more and more fed up with everything is so great. When Mai congratulates you on something and Chadley tells her he didn't give her that capability, you can just tell he's had it and doesn't give a fuck.
    Chadley is lowkey hilarious.
While I generally like the game, so many of these one off mini games are not fun. Everything is also oddly slow to load and transition. 

Coming from like a dragon 8, the team could learn a lot about how to integrate minigames into your RPG
33 hours in and I just learned that you can 'repair' the chocobo stops. XD

I was wondering what the point of them was, and didn't even bother using them lol
Anyone else love how the piano game is low-key, teaching us musical theory with a visual representation of the circle of fifths
I finally managed to get my copy and sink a few hours into something else than the demo. Holy fuck you guys weren't kidding, this is good
Guys ive been disappointed from FF7 Rebirth, was expecting a better experience been waiting years for the continuation but this game sucks feels like an typical assassins creed game open world bs and devil may cry action, the Remake was special for some reason , I will list things I dislike

- Open world: Compared to OG final fantasy open world type where it had mystery and exploration excitement, this one is like a usual ACreed, most of new games open world is the same, go activate this pillar, go fight this boss, go gather this intel etc, for me the best open world games type is skyrim and fallout 4, i enjoyed remake's linear story much more.  
- Synergy bs: what the hell is this tons of abilities/skills with all buttons shortcuts what am I playing piano? is anyone using all these?   
- Story: Remake was solid it had weight and suspence, this one feels like an anime party like this whole adventure feels empty i feel im not fighting for something..  
- Minigames: tons of silly mini games, like im playing atari all mediocre I didnt got hooked with neither maybe because the game itself doesnt let me enjoy it procrastinating with bs all the time...  
- Party AI: party feels nonexistent i have them only for autocast cure   
- Magic & Materias: i feel like they dont have weight, you could just hit n slash everything without using anything  
- Weapon Upgrade: Basically it doesnt have weapon upgrade, if its the folio thing its so bad

I could list more things but man,,, Remake was perfect I loved it why they had to butcher this so hard like they tried so hard to put stuff there by force forgetting what was FF.. does anyone feels similar?
As good as most of this game is, it has way too many parts where it forces you to just walk slowly towards something without any real purpose. It's frustratingly boring and really takes you out of the game.
    Gongaga made me quit the game.  That, and the Ubisoft levels of pointlessness and boring nature of the side content.  It's good for one, maybe 2 areas.  By Costa Del Sol, I was thoroughly tired of the open world waypoints.  By Gongaga, I wanted to cry.


I love the combat.  I love the characters and story.  But damn, I don't think I'll ever finish it.
I only found 1 JRPG I liked golden sun. Octopath has more hours afk the actual play time.This game is great and if this is what modern jrpgs have to offer I'm there
First review is in on Opencritic from Console Creatures :

[https://opencritic.com/game/15136/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/reviews](https://opencritic.com/game/15136/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/reviews)

" **Essential**

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is incredible. I struggled to complete my review because I had so much fun working through each region in a nearly 100-hour playthrough. I dread waiting another four years for the finale but put my faith in Square Enix's hands. If Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth indicates what to expect going forward then I believe in the vision. The ending will be divisive for many people, but it means as much to the developers as it does to fans, and because of that idea, I walk away content with where we left off."
Great so far, but objects need to de-render or turn invisible when the camera is physically close to them. This is an ancient feature in most games so I'm surprised they overlooked it.
Genuinely quite disappointed with the visuals overall in this game. Played for about 3.5 hours (up to getting a chocobo) and while at some points the game genuinely looks stunning, a lot of the time the lighting looks extremely flat and weird, the animations are pure jank - especially when exploring the open world, and the textures in some spots are abhorently bad - like literally PS3 quality bad. When all the above come together in the same scene the game can briefly look like something that's 5-10 years old. It's really weird. The performance mode is also still extremely borked in terms of visual clarity, it's very blurry. The graphics mode is how I've been playing because of this and it's been alright on the whole, but I wish there was some camera motion blur to mask the low framerate because without it, it can look a bit juddery.

Years of playing Final Fantasy games has conditioned me to expect much better than the presentation that this game offers. Maybe that's a side effect of making such a massive open world game on UE4. And hopefully a lot can be cleaned up with patches, but SE being SE I'm really not very hopeful.
Was reading through this trying to figure out what was nagging me about the game.  Lot of folks complaining about the open world, and finally dawned on me why I'm not really digging it, and I think its how clunky getting around is.  I normally like to go for getting as much as possible because I don't like to miss things, and usually don't mind most open world mechanics, but to me it feels like the game is fighting you on even just wandering around.  

Moving over obstacles is clunky, climbing walls/cliffs is slow and janky, and Cloud/Chocobo seem to halt before every slight drop.  Overall keep feeling like the game is deliberately trying to waste my time with slow walking/crawling segments, long button holding animations for operating a lever/door, and whatever those stupid vacuum things were.
Holy shit… we’ve made it to the next part of the unknown journey
is there any fix for the auto-exposure lighting? It's so freaking insane that in broad daylight looking down certain areas it's freaking pitch black. Realism? Who the heck needs that?
Holy crap, where is the reduce mai dialogue frequency setting? Just shut up lady!
As someone whose introduction to the world of FFVII is remake/rebirth I have to say I can definitely see why it has the reputation it does. 

The characters are enjoyable. Tifa’s relationship with Cloud is certainly one I find the most intriguing so far. Tifa is also my favorite character due to her play style and how good of a character I think she is. Barret is a close second.  I’m only just starting the Juno story Section at 17hrs in. There’s a lot to do! 

I’ve been alternating story and open world sections, one I get through or bored of open world, I go to story and vice versa. Battle system is a bit hectic at times, but assessing enemies that I’m having trouble with definitely helps expedite battles. This variation helps things not get too stale. 

The mini games are a nice distraction when you need a change of pace.
    It's cool to hear a newcomer's perspective
Can someone explain how they feel about dynamic difficulty? I want to run this difficulty on my first playthrough, but I’m curious what the experience has been like thus far.
    it solves the old tale of if i do too many sidequests ill overlevel for main story
    We haven't had access to that difficulty but I suspect it means you can over level and if you come back to a missed side quest it scales up.
    I imagine it's like FF8, where enemies scale up with you. I hope that enemies have a base level though, so it can't be cheesed like FF8.
anyone who ordered overnight shipping get their copy shipped yet or a label created? mine is still awaiting fulfillment
    From what I've seen nobody with overnight shipping has left awaiting fulfillment yet, im thinking they hand them off to carriers later than normal orders because the carriers handle the faster shipping anyway
I would like to pre-order the deluxe edition. Unfortunately, I could not buy the deluxe edition before and it seems to be sold out everywhere.

Is there a pre-order bonus for physical copies? Can I wait until after the game release to order the deluxe edition? How likely are the physical copies to be restocked for pre-order?
    They've been restocked multiple times the past few days through Amazon/Best Buy/Gamestop. Follow wario64 on Twitter and he'll post when it goes live somewhere for you to order.
        Well there's my problem, I keep checking Square's store.
            Yeah. I got an order from gamestop in yesterday. Would've preferred best buy but that's one got restocked. The best buy got restocked an hour after I ordered. Oh well haha

For those waiting, just wanted to share that I got an email today saying that my collector's edition has shipped.  I live in California, and my order was placed on November 27th.  The tracking number is in the email, but I don't see it on the Square Enix website.  It was shipped via UPS, and currently the only tracking information on UPS's site is "label created. " The current estimated delivery date is Wednesday 2/28
Does anyone know any streamers that are quick to upload playthroughs? I’m so beyond excited for this game but don’t have a PS5 so I can’t play it for myself, but I also want to experience the game firsthand and not through spoilers. I’m not sure how long I could hold out though before I start scouring the internet for spoilers 🥲
    Watch max he got plans on playing it
    Don't know how fast she uploads but check "Julia_tv". I just recently discovered her through youtube recommendations and she just recently did a FF7 Remake blind playthrough (She has no knowledge at all as to the OG, Crisis Core, Advent Children or any other older FF7 product so its a completely blind playthrough). 

She even uploaded her playing the demos and it was so entertaining watch her be so amused at "Cloud"'s mannerisms during the Nibelheim flashback (again she has no prior knowledge)

She also said she is looking forward to Rebirth.
So I never did the pre-order thing, and it seems all pre-orders are sold out now.  How likely is it I'll be able to pick up a physical copy in stores on the 29th when I get off work?
Patiently waiting for the OST to start being uploaded lol
    Some of its already up from the Vinyl OST, there was even some of the music from the demo someone uploaded but I can't find it.
May be considered a spoiler but, did any reviewer have much to say about the difficulty in general, and the dynamic difficulty in particular? If so, got a link?
Anyone wanting **personal** shipping data points:

Pre-ordered CE in September. Shipping label printed on Feb 10 (and email saying shipped) w/ initial estimate of delivery on Feb 16.  (which I had no expectation of being kept)

Ordered standard shipping. (forget how much overnight was, maybe as much as the digital)

Got notification this morning that it's with UPS in Nevada, with an estimated delivery near Washington DC on March 1st.
    CE, Florida, March 1st 😞
Did Best buy start shipping for anybody yet?
    by thursday for me. hoping itll ship soon, im getting anxious
    My order still hasn’t moved. Crossing my fingers that tomorrow’s the day, otherwise I’m assuming I won’t get to play until this weekend :(
Finally got charged for my deluxe edition from best buy!!! Hoping it arrives on time
    Best Buy charged me too after an almost heart attack of receiving an email that the authorization failed and I have 24 hours to update it.
    Same! Packaging my Item is what it says on the page.
Best Buy update - finally got a tracking number from UPS but its still too early for the UPS website to recognize the number
Just got an email from Amazon, I have an estimated delivery date of Feb 29 for the deluxe edition.
Bought the CE straight from square, label was made Saturday but still no movement... Since I live 7 hours from Henderson NV I'm hoping it actually gets shipped tomorrow and I still get it by Thursday. 

And here I was crossing fingers I'd get the physical copy early.

Anyone else with the CE have no delivery date and just says label created? I don’t know what to do anymore, I won’t even be able to play the game at all now since I can’t afford to buy a copy and I see no updates or solutions about this shipping situation from SE or crappy shipnetwork hopefully it updates today or something, in the USA also since that might matter in regards to the shipping. Really turning something I’ve been looking forward to for years into a depressing headache unfortunately
Well New Zealand folks we have 15 minutes to wait! Enjoy!
Anyone who ordered two day shipping still waiting or has everyone gotten theres?

and EST people, have you gotten your overnight shipping updates yet? mine is stuck on label created
Tracking hasn’t updated since the 25th. Still is Nevada. SMH.
Finally got an update at 7 PM est, arriving tmmrw! if you ordered overnight shipping dont panic!
Just heard Phil Collins In the Air Tonight on the radio. Feels appropriate. Hype is at a fever pitch now. 
Does anyone know if the dlc items are worthy of a "deluxe" edition upgrade?
    Armor and accessories don't matter at all. They aren't even cosmetic (as far as I know.)

Moogle Trio Summon you can get by pre-ordering standard edition from PSN store.

Do you care about digital artwork and soundtrack? Personally, I don't. There's gonna be plenty of artwork available for free and the entire soundtrack will be on Spotify/Youtube Music.

That just leaves the Magic Pot Summon. Not worth $20.
        Dude, thank you for this info. Sounds like I'm going to save some $$ now.
DE with overnight shipping, no update beyond “Label Created” as of 8:10 PM CST (US) in case anyone else is in the same boat.

Edit:  Ordered in September
Edit: the full installation seems to have fixed this




Has anyone had issues with getting the Demo bonuses? I've used the "Bonus" menu item and it registered my Intergrade and Intermission saves but not for the demo. I've completed Niebelheim (and Junon but I know you don't get anything for that).
So how is performance mode? Any different than the demo?
    I think it looks better than it did in the demo, but it's still not super sharp. However, I definitely think the silky smooth 60fps is worth it.
Anyone replayed the demo part of the game yet in the full version here and know if any of it (the Materia?) carries over if you run through now? I want to know if there are any new cutscenes as well. I’m about to decide if I should just run through it all again or skip to save time.
    Nope
Just now made it to the open world and started at 11:00 on the dot. I might have a Queens Blood addiction.
    Same here 😅
So isn’t it supposed to let you skip the Nibelheim portion from the demo? There’s a bit at the start that wasn’t in the demo but now it seems it’s making me replay the entire chapter? Not a huge deal but I feel like I messed it up somehow
    Keep going. At a certain point a prompt will come up. I will say once you get to the Cloud crawling on the ground scene don't skip or you will end up in Kalm.
        I got there. Thanks for the heads up!
I am trying to check  my bonuses and it just said No eligible saved data found. I have remake, intergrade, completed the demo. Please help.

Now that rebirth has released, I'd want to ask this question, should I play Crisis core reunion or maybe watch Advent children movie before playing FFVII rebirth? 

Context: I haven't played the OG game, and don't intend to play it for a while now.  Having played and loved the remake, I'm so excited to play rebirth, and crisis core reunion is on my play list as well. Just a question, whether I should play it before rebirth (since SE kinda remade it and released it before rebirth) or should I reserve it for later after completing the remake trilogy?

I understand the unanimous recommended way to enjoy the remake series is to have played the original one before, but due to time constraints I can only play so much, so I don't intend to play it any time soon.

Thanks!
    Crisis core spoils a major plot point that should only be revealed much later in Rebirth or even maybe part 3. So IMO, don't touch it
Does anyone else feel like Chadley is like Clippy from Microsoft office? He interrupts a ton during his errands and is actually a but more annoying than Clippy since it stops gameplay. I feel like the only reason he's like that is because they wanted to utilize the controller sound and put the animation of that communicator in to feel more immersive. I think it breaks immersion more than it should. I find it quite annoying and distracting. I'm enjoying the game overall, but I've got a ton of small complaints like this.
11 hrs in and this game is amazing. Got some minor nitpicks but I can't put the controller down.
Just got screwed by UPS, apparently. What a crock of shit!

Anyone else order the amazon deluxe edition and not get the codes?
How worthwhile are the side quests and exploration stuff to do? I'm curious if any of that stuff offers really cool lore or character background info as opposed to mostly just sticking to main story.
    They deepen character bonds and that will impact story scenes later
    theres some good dialogue with party members during some quests, but besides money and xp
    Assessing enemies, specifically the Battle Intel ones, unlocks new challenges in the Battle Simulator which gives you special Materia. Stuff like Enemy Skill (the whole Materia itself *and* the ability to learn the moves) comes from there. Personally, I'm about to unlock what is so far the only Elemental I've seen, which is in one of the Simulator battles unlocked in the Junon region.

Also, the side quests are massively improved (so far); each one features Cloud+A Party Member and deepens their bond. Not only that, but the NPCs are more interesting this time around, and the quest itself usually teaches you something about the world. For instance, in the Junon area, there is a quest involving a creature we knew about in OG but got very little background on. This quest completely revolves around that creature. If you want to know, it's the >!Condor from Fort Condor.!<

Anyway, this game is *about* the world, and that shines through in the side content. Not every single thing is premium content, but it is very enjoyable and very impressive considering SE's track record.
        I really like how the new Enemy Skill works. You don't need to do any weird shit to manipulate enemies or get them to attack your one specific character, instead you just gotta explore, scan enemies, and  then do the region's specific battle simulator. So much more fun and feels like some clear linear progress too.

    Gasp, your posterity
Tons of people out there complaining about the gym minigames or whatever else. Meanwhile UPS still hasn’t delivered my pre order and it’s on track to deliver Monday evening. 🤦‍♂️
Still absolutely loving this so far, but one thing seems absolutely crazy to me: planet's favor/blessings. Surely the most abundant crafting material in any game ever made? 

What on earth is the point of it? Just cut it out of the game and nothing at all changes, other than having to press triangle every fucking three seconds. 

Can't believe that made it past playtesting.
    What's the point of any of the crafting. 

Just collecting stuff as I run around I never have enough for making the items I need.
If they're doing a remaster collection with all 3 games in 5-10 years for PS6 or PS7, I hope they're able to upgrade their lighting to path tracing. The game looks beautiful when properly lit, but the lighting is sometimes absolutely abhorrent and makes the game looks really bad.
Okay, am I the only one who finds it INFURIATING that they actively dissuade you from completing side quests due to the >!friendship mechanic!< ?

>!Apparently, much like in the original, your date is determined by which party members like you the best, which seems primarily influenced by doing "their" side quests. So you're basically incentivized to ONLY do side content pertaining to your personal favorite. It sucks ass.!<
    There are moments in the game where the gang is just standing around doing their own thing like when you get to Kalm. Only check in on the person you want to go on the date with, unless MSQ forces it, and they will always be ahead of the party.
The Metacritic user score is puzzling me - it keeps jumping all over the place. Was 9.5 when I went to bed and now is 8.4. Are they moderating the reviews?
I’m so glad there aren’t trophies for mini games… except the junon protorelic

But no sit-up trophy & no pirate shooting trophy makes me happy. 


I friggin love the doggo soccer though
Has it been announced when are they releasing the music onto streaming platforms

Especially No Promises to Keep
Anyone feels like materia took too long to level up? I just got the AP up materia and it still too long, should I grind more?
Is there a way to clear all the fog on a section of the map? I thought completing all activities in an area would do it, or do you have to physically go all over to clear it?
How do you fix that horrible zoomed out camera
Is there a way to untrack side quests?  I don’t see an option, I tracked one by mistake.
Oof.. I suck at piano 😂
    Same. It's difficult for me to keep my eye on both wheels. Might be easier if I sat closer to my monitor.
    I've heard a lot of people suggest turning note speed up
[deleted]
    Her and Chadley. I'll do all the tedious side content, but Jesus, I don't need a long annoying discussion every time I check something off the list.
    Somewhere in settings, you have to scroll down to the last option. It only turns MAI off when you repeat a fiend hunt, not the first time, but better than nothing. Fucking insane whoever thought this was a good idea.
Ended up being right that they wouldn't let Cid smoke.
I am beginning to wonder if the texture pop in is a glitch because I’ve never seen it in a game this bad. From foliage being blobs and then popping into detail when you get close to even rocks loading in as you run. It’s very bizarre. The game is beautiful don’t get me wrong but I keep thinking we have a door situation like in Remake only on a more massive scale.
Im a big fan but the open world repetition feels unrewarding.  Weapon vendors have never felt more irrelevant.  And skill trees needed cross-tree choices or just more options in each tree.
Is it me or are the non story NPCs so poorly out of place. They way they dress and look is almost comical and most of their dialogue and cloud never responding is just weird
The party's AI in this game is just absolute shit.
So, I will plan it this game either way, just replaying remake, but does everyone on Reddit just despise this game?  The reviews across the board are pretty positive, except here.  Am I missing something?
Oh man where do i start

I put the game down for a week once i did the bit with the cat..

Man its so fkcing stupid,throwing boxes so elevators can move,etc.. man how stupid can that level be

Like very time i want to pick up the game again i am like fck i got to finish that level -.-

Also feel like the whole open world is just the same 5-6 stuff with different pallete
climb tower,find this ,find that and thats it,just different enemies

The minigames ,man are they boring, story i wont even star at the story

Surprised how crititcs didnt point out all the flaws,and instead focused on nostalgia n
    So, I actually saw this comment *before* I got to this part of the game, and saw a few others talking about this section too. NGL, I was dreading it and worried I'd take a break. The doom and gloom about this section had me worried.

So, I got to that point a few days ago and it was over in like...idk like 30-45m? So I figured "surely, there must be more. This must be why Redditors were so angry."

Nope. Just that 1 section. It's also very easy. Was box-throwing the most engaging mechanic? No. But is it cool that they took a sub character and fleshed him out enough to have his own solo-playable section? I think so.

It really wasn't bad. If you're letting a minor section of the game completely ruin the whole thing for you, maybe it's best to take a break from screens for a while to get some fresh air and perspective.
        It's not that single fcking thing man


Look we have a ff game with open world? Fck yea, what the devs do with this open world? Fcking nothing 


All regions boil down to the same stupid stuff, climb 6 towers go pres triangle at these springs, etc.. It's worse than the actual ubisoft copy paste stuff, there is barely anything to do in open world.. Let's look at the other stuff. Mini games, there is more attention being paid to mini games than the world and story combined 


Who asked for all of these? Like we solve most stuff with mini games, it gets boring real fast 


Don't even start me with the story and it makes no sense at all, like seriously how they approved some of the stuff is beyond me 


That part of the game is just extra boring 
Why is no one talking about the bad controls and camera? IMO the control scheme that they have established in the first game does not translate very well in the open type environment Rebirth introduces. Instead of being able to freely jump on surfaces, I have to constantly do trial and errors of finding the right terrain and shit to climb on, mashing circle left and right while constantly bumping into shit that the game doesn't want me to go to. Chocobo riding makes this worse, as bumping into random shit interrupts the bird's momentum. Top this off with the horrible camera that they did not bother improving at all. 

Plus navigating is so horrible. There's no waypoint system of any sort and you can't have both the tracker and minimap active at the same time! I'm roaming around Gongaga right now and I'm so fucking pissed I can't get to a world intel location. And these fucking mushrooms make me go to places I don't want to go to!!!!
Been really enjoying the game. It's something I kind of tend to go back and forth with since I am trying to complete most of the map.   


I'm currently in Gongaga and have now stepped back on the exploring a tad bit and here's why:  


MIA and Chadley do not add any fun experience to the game. In fact, the world quests become very tedious with it just being copy paste of the same thing. Normally, I am not someone to nitpick on little thing like loading times and such, but my god, MIA talks over any combat world quests (I know you can turn her off now in the menu and then mute your controller) but why even have that? I also dislike Chadley just butting in every time I am exploring to tell me about some useless information that is literally on the map to go find. He adds nothing of importance and talks more than my party.   


Pros:  


\- Really love the combat. I like being able to change up my party, I love being able to play in a way that fits my style with the characters I mostly want to play with, and its been fun trying different combos with Synergy. 

&#x200B;

\- I also like how the world doesn't feel as empty as it looks in some ways. I almost had a moment of wishing more enemies were around, but I find that it's actually a good balance between space to just run and enemies to just fight.   


\- I am one of the few where graphics is just not a big deal to me. Most people want cutting edge out of this world, but because I have poor eye sight to begin with, I can't tell if something is "low quality" so to me, the graphics are fine.   


\- I have really enjoyed the goofy atmosphere of the gang! I also really like seeing everyone react outside of cutscenes (like Cloud petting the baby Chocos). 

&#x200B;

\- I love Queens Blood too! I just love getting into a game with someone and I love collecting the cards. The Chocobo race was also fun. 

&#x200B;

\- So far loving the story, I think it's just poorly paced out in a strange way because I have been doing world quest. Will probably not do those going forward unless its on my way.  


Cons:  


\- Dodging or parrying is such a pain in the ass. If you have too many enemies, its practically a useless feature and in a way, Synergy can also become useless with any dodge mechanics simply because of timing. It's bad. There needs to be a better indicator for the dodge/parrying mechanic because otherwise, I don't use it even though I was super excited to. There are either way too many enemies to figure out which direction you need to dodge in, or the gaming is just so fast paced that it doesn't matter. I mostly am dodging out of the way rather than attempting the parry mechanic.   


\- Please just remove Chadley and MIA. I just hate them in my game. If I could remove Chadley from ever opening his mouth as a setting, I would.  


\- The pacing between world quests, side quests and the main story are not good. I'll go off for days trying to complete an area only to get fed up and completely forget what the heck is going on in the story. It's just not tied very well for the world quest stuff. I would have preferred if side quest items got tied into the world quest to make it make sense and then have it tie back into the main story. I also have no idea why I explore so much when I can either buy everything I miss. In a crazy way, open world actually hurt this game, it didn't add to it.   


\- I'm one of the few who probably dislikes the mini-games. I never played the OG, so I have no idea if the mini-games were this involved, but it's pretty awful. I really hate the piano one with the joystick. I'm just not one who wants to spend hours learning the gimmick behind it to make it work, which is a shame since I play the piano and was very excited once I learned it existed. I also just dislike how many there are to even progress the game.   


\- I find it super strange that as my relationship improves with my team, they are dead silent as we explore. I would love that little banter we get when I do their specific side quests, but (and I also consider this a PRO) I kind of like that my characters are not constantly just talking to the point of annoyance with the same 4 lines of dialogue.   


\- I do not enjoy finding the Chadley towers. I don't understand the point of them when you have the owl guide that will take you to certain places and when I stumble upon areas myself. The towers only show you about 2-4 world quests in the area but also keep the map covered in fog. The towers should unveil the area in total or just not be there. Either have the guide owls or have the towers. I kind of like a map that looks clean, so it annoys me a bit when there are minor spots in fog yet everything is done.   


Overall, as I stopped doing the world quests minus maybe the summons (which I'm not a fan of unlocking them) I did enjoy the game more. The world quests almost feel like a slap on afterthought rather than something that moves along the story. While it gives a lot of world building notes, Chadley and MIA's incessant banter in the background is not only aggravating, but just downright annoying that I skip those scenes or just mute my controller speaker. I can't believe how much screen time they get.   


At the same time, I also feel like once you take out all of the world quest and extra tidbits (like the mini-games) the world does feel a lot more flat than I would like and the story falls victim to that issue.
Does this game stop ripping control away from you eventually?

I am constantly being interrupted by chadley or walking behind allies at a slow place or watching a tutorial. I understand there are mechanics to explain but come on.
Can the dev team consider the following for FF7 Rebirth please?

1. Option for auto lock on in settings

2. Proper waypoint - sometimes getting to places is tricky

3. Option to toggle what Stats to see and option to change color of attack and damage stats, crit etc. and also customise stat color per character.

4. Option to toggle audio level - background chatter when running through town. I'm sure we had a similar option in Remake.  Turn off all background chatter when moving through story. Cosmo canyon was a good example of back chatter talking over Grandpa dialogue

5. Materia and equipment party presets
4 hours in and it's absolutely incredible. The sound design is Oscar-worthy. No other game switches that seamlessly between battle music and background music. The locations take what we all had in our teenage imagination and fully realise them. Kalm was a single screen with one or two NPCs in 1997, and this version would be the main city in FFXVI.

Some small issues with clipping / NPC weirdness and unpolished dialogue. Also Cloud's character model is the most basic of the whole party (why? he's the main character). But other than that it's living up to the expectations of a game I waited 4 years for.

Find someone who will treat you with as much love as this development team has treated the source material.

Can we talk about how bad the lighting is in this game?  I mean its really the worst lighting Ive seen in a modern game to date.  Its completely broken.  Never mind all the other jank with their graphics engine I find the lighting the most immersion breaking and distracting.  Mind you it looks mostly fine at night its just the daytime scenes which is the majority of Rebirth.  Remake had this problem to a lesser degree.  The game always looked better at night.

\*Warning the videos are of Cosmo Canyon if you dont want to spoil anything visually.

    I agree the lighting is bad. First instance is when you talk to Tifa in Kalm about the watertower

They did say though that a patch was coming to fix the graphics in performance mode (they specifically mentioned that they heard people complained that the faces were "scary" in some scenes due to lighting. Yes the word "scary" was used)
No offense mods but can we just open the sub up, why are we forced into a 3 threads for the whole damn game

edit: found r/FinalFantasyVII/
I don't understand any of the hate I am seeing.  Sure the open world design is not revolutionary, but I find running around the map completing all of the world intel tasks to be very addicting.  It helps that the world is so unique and gorgeous to look at. The combat itself is also very satisfying once you master it, and it's fun to try out different party combinations.  The minigames, especially Queen's Blood are a lot of fun as well and I have spent many hours on Queen's Blood alone. The story is, well, it's Final Fantasy VII and it's awesome so far.  No complaints on my end, 36 hours in and MAYBE just reached the halfway point.  Usually I start to get burnt out on a game after the 25-30 hour mark, but I am still fully addicted to this game.

Edited to add: Now that I think about it, I do have one complaint.  As much fun as some of the minigames may be, I am really not a fan of so many of them being mandatory in order to progress the story.
This lock down really makes for a dull subreddit.
    It’s fine, really. Before you know it the game will be a month or two old and the sub will be back to being inundated with twelve separate theory threads per day.
        Don't forget the Tifa cosplays!
To anyone who has played the game already I have a question.

I plan to replay the flashback section of the Demo the night before I receive the main game - there is an obvious section of the flashback missing from the demo (the Mako reactor scenes up to the cut back to Kalm).

Is it at this point where your save that carried over from the Demo picks up or does it skip to the start of chapter 2?

Just don’t want to miss out on anything on my first main playthrough.

Many thanks in advance
    your save doesn't carry over. once you get partly up Mt. Nibel the game comes up with a prompt saying you have a demo save file and asking if you'd like to skip the demo portion. if you click yes it starts you right after the burning village sequence
I'm convinced SE lost my CE. Still not passed label created. Kill me.
    or theyre just running behind. this is happening to several people. that is far from a possibility tbh. Id wait a day or two before coming to that conlcusion
So uhm... Has anyone else had this weird thing where you fast travel and for a few seconds you can't move and Cloud just turns around and starts clapping? 

No I'm not joking, this just happened to me lmfao
God damnit! Hard mode to force a 2nd play through. I hated that about 7R and 16. 

Get rid of hard mode or let us select it from the start
    I don't like hard mode trophies in general for open world games. It's ok with mission based or straightforward chapter based but if I'm expected to spend 150 hours on the first playthrough, asking me to do it again for a trophy is too much for me.
Please tell me there's a way to turn off the goddamn 3 second timer during dialogue options. The timer is out by the time I read the options. Timer is a huge dick move.
    lmao yeah it's painful. I'm also playing in a language I'm slow at reading (not my native language) and sometimes it hurts. Also fun fact, if you save before the dialogue and try again, the choices are shuffled and not always in the same position so you still need to figure out where the correct one is and I always panic.
Will Red XIII please eat something? 

He looks like one he came out of a Sara McLachlan dog cruelty video. Every time I look at him I hear "in the arms of an angel" playing softly in the background. Is there a ASPCA that I can donate to in Midgar?
In the original, the boat to Costa del Sol was a small cargo boat.

In the remake, it's a friggin' Royal Caribbean cruise ship.

I don't think there's any better metaphor for how much work this dev team has put into this remake.
I’m about halfway through and I would bet a lot of money the third game will be called “Final Fantasy VII: Reunion”
    I thought the same, but they used it already for the crisis core remaster and that would be redundant if used twice. 
    Been used.  I'm going with Remembrance.
        Revengence.
Whoever had the idea to change Red's voice should never be allowed to make another design decision.  Ever.  It's horrible.  
    I agree. Instead of having him stay with his physical character of a 40+ something hunan year dog that only changes his demeanors to his real teen dog age with those who are near and dear to him, they literally change his physical voice to a teen.

This over simplification ruins the nuances of his character.
    THIS! 

It is egregious. An actual crime against sound mixing. It'd be one thing if it held notes of the initial voice we get from Red but sounds on every level both wrong. I honestly (when it happened) thought it was a flub or error but nope. It was intentional. The person who decided that was the voice of Nanaki should be banned. (Not the VA mind you, the person who said "that is the performance I want").

    STOP THE COUNT!
What amount of sava data do I need to get that Moogle Charm? I don't really want to play any of the demos but don't wanna miss out on stuff.  What does it even do anyways?
Do you need to have a completed save file of Intermission on PS5 in order to get Ramuh? Or just any save file for Intermission?

What about the save file in FF7:R for Leviathan? Does it have to be a completed save file?

I've seen reports by people with early physical copies of Rebirth say that you need completed save files in order to unlock the DLC. Other reports say it's any save file.

I'm confused.

Thanks.
    Any save file, I believe. I only did one playthrough of Intermission and it transferred over. However, it needs to check your save files each time you start a news game.
What is the starting Level and what is the Level Cap?
    the level cap is 70
        Thank you. Do you know what the start Level is?
            it's somewhere around 15-20, sorry not exactly sure
Whats everyone's default 3-person team so far in the demo

Was using Cloud-Aerith-Red but I had to replace Red with Tifa for the Phoenix boss

Assuming Yuffie has her elemental ninjutsu mechanic back then she's a definite inclusion in the main game
    I use the default Cloud-Aerith-Red as well since Red's Vengeance Mode and Aerith's Radiant Ward lasers feel too good to pass up, but I swapped Cloud out for Barret for all the VR fights including Phoenix. I don't think I'm gonna be able to stick with just one party in the full game, I love everyone's playstyle.
    Cloud/Red/Aerith is the most broken. You can solo Phoenix with Red lol
Has anyone gotten a shipping update from Best Buy yet? My order still hasn't shipped. I called them yesterday and they seemed confident that it would get here on the 29th but I'm getting antsy. Standard edition btw.
I am getting a PS5 soon, and may get this game, but I do want to know, does anyone know if there are any bonuses in game for playing Remake? I don't think it would be anything substantial, but it would still be good info to know.
    You get a summon materia, >!Leviathan!< and then you get >!Ramuh!< if you played the DLC as well.
Anyone know which courier they use the UK for the CE? 

I had to checkout as guest when CE went on sale as the login was down so I don't have any info or updates on my order other than the confirmation which just says "Standard shipping".

Should I be expecting a release day delivery or is it likely to be later?
Midnight release time for digital copies means 9pm US pacific time right?
Anyone else getting a delay with their order from Square?

Ordered the collectors edition and my tracking number now says “We were unable to dispatch the trailer on time” and there’s no estimated delivery date now.
    No delay just been sitting at shipping label created for a couple weeks. Hoping it moves today. I want to play this weekend.
anyone got updates on their Best Buy orders for store pickup? I preordered the deluxe edition back in September and my status has been stuck on “Preordered” ever since.
Amazon charged me yesterday and it arrived today! Pros of living on a tiny island. 

Their website still says it's arriving Thursday though lol.
all I'm doing is refreshing this page periodically because its all I got holding me down until release day xD
So it says the steelbook (the extra with the girls) is ready to be shipped and arriving by Thursday with a fedex tracking number, but the deluxe edition itself is still “ship by Thursday”. But they must be in the same box right? Should I feel confident enough to cancel my amazon order which says it will arrive Thursday?
Can someone help figure out which version I need to buy for someone who has never played final fantasy before? 

I’m kinda confused between the rebirth, remake and twin package. 
    Twin package has both games, rebirth & remake.

Basically you are getting remake for free
        Sweet, I’ll get that one. Thanks! 
Anyone who has ordered any edition from SE store in NA get any shipping updates? Mines still in Henderson, NV, with a label created but awaiting pickup.
I don't suppose it's possible to upgrade my preorder from digital to digital deluxe, right? I just want to pay them 10 more dollars, but that doesn't seem possible through the PS store. I also looked to see if I could refund the preorder and then purchase the deluxe, but no dice there. Womp womp.
    there likely won't be an upgrade path, there wasn't for Remake. the only way would be to cancel your preorder and then re-purchase the deluxe but technically due to PS Store policy you shouldn't be able to cancel due to pre-load. if you message support and get a nice agent they'll probably cancel for you after explaining
24 hours.  time stayed in linear fashion yall.   im gonna stay up as long as i can though tonight so i can play it all night when it unlocks.
    I have work at 4.30am until 3pm u jammy git
looking like everyone with overnight shipping is still stuck at label created, at least in the US. Making me think they really do have them all theyre just waiting till last second to update and ship it out for all of us

kind of obvious, but it still is making me nervous. But considering the two day shipping people are getting updates im confident we’ all get it tomorrow
Best Buy updated- FedEx tracking number provided, saying will be delivered tomorrow. Huzzahhh!!!
anyone buy the collectors edition and have their package still in nevada right now?
I really hope this still arrives this Friday. 🤦It just got updated to Shipped status. It's impossible from Winsonsin to West Texas via USPS unless it's gonna fly.

https://preview.redd.it/di3c2ezczclc1.jpeg?width=718&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ddc631002cbc04f8c1c9f70967660715784a739
Anyone who prepurchased with Best Buy showing that the game is ready for pick up at the store (2/28)?

I'm tempted to head down there today even though street date isn't until tomorrow.

Edit: the website says in big letters release on 2/29 so I doubt they'll sell it to me. If I was in the area I'd made a stop by but a separate trip ain't worth it
    Same status (Ready for Pickup, Available for pickup on  Thursday)! We might have to wait for the email before pickup but i guess sometimes that depends on your local Best Buy.
    Yes! Same boat but it says UPS has the package since the 25th. Opened a claim to see WTH is going on.
I have to beat Remake before Rebirth unlocks at midnight. I’m in chapter 17 right after the bridge collapses and Cloud is running around with Red. Anyone know about how many hours I’ve got left from here?
    Just take your time finishing Remake. There’s no reason to rush into Rebirth. You also need to play Intergrade before Rebirth
I was pretty confident Id get a shipping notification (i payed for one day shipping) the day before release but its 2 PM and still nothing
My Amazon Deluxe Edition finally shipped!!

Check your orders if you ordered from Amazon.
Amazon order not arriving early... coming tomorrow.  But I'm going to see Dune 2 anyways so I dont mind too much
Ordered CE through SE. got update for UPS that I’m receiving tomorrow between 12-4p. Not that it matters at this point since I’m now watching Dune tomorrow 🤷🏽‍♀️
As with everyone else, my CE finally updated saying it's coming tomorrow. Really sucks to lose an entire potential play day, but definitely not worth $70 for one day early access.
I pre-ordered from Bestbuy on the most recent restock last week. They shipped it today from Ohio to be delivered by the 5th. Anyone else in the same boat waiting the weekend out?
    oh my gosh.. I got my best buy deluxe edition from Hotstocks on 2/21 and its set to arrive tomorrow. also from Ohio and its currently in my city. I hope your estimated arrival changes soon
        Thanks. Oh dang. Me too lol. I was a bit bothered that BB wouldn't let me pick up at store or send to store. 

I suppose I can try and finish FF16 by Tuesday before Rebirth gets here. Avoiding spoilers will be difficult.
anyone whos played the game on disc- how long does disc installation take ?
    looking at timestamps you might not need this info anymore, but for me it was about 25 minutes to install the data disc and an update triggered by the play disc
Anyone know if anything from the Nibelheim demo carries over to the main game? Like materia, the score from playing the piano, etc

I have the game already. It's copying from the disc but I don't know if I should still skip the demo part
Has anyone found Tifa's Theme on the piano? I went to grab it in the full game and it wasn't there. Everyone made fun of me because I didn't have anything to play.  Is it just later in the game somewhere or still somewhere in Nibelheim?
Is dynamic difficulty bugged? Everything is dying super fast as if on easy 
[deleted]
    Same issue.
I’m a little disappointed in the performance mode, everything just looks so blurry compared to graphics mode. possibly one of the most jarring differences i’ve seen in a game
CE buyer here. Still in transit, said it would be delayed tomorrow, now doesn't say a date. Feels awful putting more money into the game just to play it super late.
Happened with Remake as well.
Are there any downsides to playing on Easy mode? I got wrecked pretty easily in the Junon demo and found the game to be more enjoyable on Easy, at least until I get more comfortable with the combat.
**Question about Deluxe Edition**  
  
This is for anyone that got the Deluxe Edition. I know that, inside it, there is the PS5 regular game case (which of course houses the two discs). What I am wondering is, does this game case that's already inside the Deluxe packaging also have cellophane wrapping on it? 

I ask because I scored an Amazon order of the Deluxe Edition last week, and it's still marked just as "Order Received" as of this morning. So I went to Target and purchased the regular version.  
My thoughts/hope is that, if/when the Deluxe version gets to my house eventually (or if I can score it elsewhere locally), I can open the Deluxe, find the PS5 game case still shrink-wrapped, and return it to Target.  
 
Of course, if the game case inside the Deluxe packaging does *not* have cellophane wrapping around it, well, then I'm screwed and will need to resort to Facebook Marketplace to offload it. But I figured it's worth asking about!
    Based on how Remake was packaged the game (wrapped in cellophane) is in the Deluxe Edition Box, however the area where the bar code would be (on the game not the Deluxe Edition Box) states "Not for Resale". Looks like you'll have to resort to Facebook Marketplace as stores need an actual bar code to make a return.
    My deluxe says not for resale where the upc would normally be on the “normal” game box
    mine does come with the wrap but also says not for resale without a barcode. im in US
Is it possible to redeem the bonus save file content later? I have played through the original, but not intergrade yet.

If I start a save now will it only be able to get whatever content I have already confirmed, or does running a new check allow the existing save to get the new bonuses if I play through intergrade later?

Edit: For people stumbling upon this when searching, yes you can! Every bonus you acquire can be redeemed by any save.
My CE tracking has finally updated to out for delivery with a window. Just need to get through the workday.
Does dynamic difficulty reward you? I only play on harder difficulty for rewards
Anyone know how to access the Queen’s Blood tutorial? I can only see the one explaining how to battle players and how to mulligan but not an in depth explanation of the game.
    Hmm I'm not sure about the tutorial but if you want a really quick explanation, here it goes:

- turn based card game, you go first, enemy goes after, then your turn again, etc

- you can only place cards on the tiles with green pips, according to the cost (if there's 1 pip, only cards with 1 pip cost can be placed)

- enemy can only place cards on tiles with red pips

- each card has a pattern that can unlock more green pips (or override the enemy's red pips with your green pips) so you can expand the area where you can place your cards (your "territory")

- pips in each tile can "accumulate", so if you have two cards on the table whose patterns overlap on one tile, that tile will become a 2-pip tile, etc

- each card has a number as its score. Scores are summed per row at the end of the game, the player with the highest score **per row** will get that entire score on its scoreboard (so if you have 6 points and the enemy has 5 points in one row, you get the full 6 points and the enemy gets 0!)

- Whoever has the most points at the end wins, game ends when both players pass (usually when there's no more places to place cards)

- Cards can have bonuses like increasing the score of adjacent cards, or reducing the score of adjacent cards (if score goes below 0, the card is destroyed. This can be used to "kill" enemy cards)

- Some cards have special abilities. Press the touchpad when you're on a card and you can see a description of what they can do

- At the beginning of the game, you can choose how many cards in your first hand to discard if you don't like them, you will draw an equal amount of cards afterwards to compensate

tl;dr - gain territory by placing cards on the tiles until the enemy cannot place their cards anymore, the one with more points wins
Any way to remove the fog of war without painstakingly going through it? I’ve done everything in grasslands but theres tiny bits of fog of war. Ideally i would have liked it to unfog once it was 100% done
Akira has a whole ass concert in kalm. I sat there listening to every song. Lmao
If anyone hasn’t seen it, restart the game if you already played the demo. There is some important stuff not shown on the demo that’s worth going though.
Holy smokes. Mommy Commander!
I missed some stuff in grasslands region but now I’m in Junior but I want to go back. Can I do it somehow cause I can’t seem to be able to fast travel there?
    Yo unlock the service at the Junon ranch.
Anyone else who pre-ordered the game have theirs canceled? I pre-ordered the physical deluxe version from Target in September, but they just canceled my order. I don't know what to do or even if it's possible to get the version anymore. I might just have to settle for the digital deluxe.
love this game!!
Still at the beginning of the game and I can already tell that I love how it shows the relationships between characters and the related gameplay mechanics.
Stoked to explore all the mechanics.

The only thing I’d criticize is the emptiness of the grasslands when leaving Kalm. I really went out exploring and was disappointed about not finding much. The only explanation I have is that the world will get filled later through some event.
I went to places thinking „There must be something to find here“ but at most it was some crafting materials. Especially disappointed about the empty beach/cove.
about 20 hrs in I decided to abandon clearing every region I'm too invested in the story...time to plow through.
Loving the game so far. But are you playing the game in performance or resolution? I am playing in resolution.
    Graphics mode in the first playthrough. It’s too gorgeous to play on performance
Question about party members, is there are sections of the gameplay when the team split up and you are forced to play in some team setup.

I am asking because I don't know if I should mix party members to play them all, or the game force me to do it(what would be great!!)
    Yes, there are several parts where the party splits up and you are forced to play with only certain party members. I think it's a good idea to regularly shuffle members around just to get familiar with the playstyle of each. Keep in mind that materia AP gain (and also regular XP gain) is shared even among non-active members so it's in your interest to keep all of them properly equipped with all kinds of materia and good gear. I usually don't like having a large roster of characters in JRPGs cause it's a pain in the ass to keep all of them up-to-level but so far this has been really effortless.
I’m only at the very beginning of Chapter One but I’m so confused! How did the party go from being carted away in helicopters and Zac carrying Aerith to all of them being in a living room in Kalm?!


Or am I supposed to be confused? If I’m supposed to be confused that’s fine
Any way to make the camera automatically lock onto an enemy in combat instead of having to click on the stick every time?

Also any way to auto run? The s.l.o.w. walking everywhere is driving me nuts
Why do some dialog choices have a time limit while other's don't? I know it's choices that affect other characters mood towards Cloud, but I find the time limit mildly annoying.
I love to take pictures from the games with the photo. Since Final Fantasy 7 Remake the photo mode is terrible, we haven't control over the camera, it's like a lock. You can't place the camera where you want. I was hoping they'd upgrade it with Rebirth but it's exactly the same. They could easily use another Photo Mode model like Horizon Forbidden West and Spider-man.
I'm loving every second of Final Fantasy Rebirth, but about the photo mode, I'm pretty sad :(
They brought back the WORST minigame from Remake: the gym crap. To balance it out, we have the best card game since Triple Triad.

Edit: not only did they bring back the gym challenges, they actively punish you for using an Edge controller or turn off haptic feedback.
    Yup fuck the sit up mini game. Not wasting anymore time on it.
So, this may be more of a PS5/TV issue, though I'm not sure.  Every once in a while during a cut scene my screen will flicker black then turn on and show HDR.  Has anyone else had this issue?

I'm using a LGC3 OLED.
    Using the same TV and not experiencing your issue
Can all the fog on the map be filled? I've seen most areas that cannot go. Is this possible????
Rough times for me and I won't have the money to get the game for a while. But I hope everyone else is enjoying it! 😊
I want to play with Aerith, but her ATB charge is soooooo slow.
    Use synergy abilities. The charged attack with Tifa instantly charges almost 2 full ATB bars for me.
What level should the characters be during chapter 3? I’m struggling a bit on one of the bosses
I'm in Junon and there are a lot of flying enemies. I found flying enemies a bit of a struggle in Remake too. So they are giving me a hard time again now. You know, can't hit them to build up ATB to be able to use a wind spell or whatever that will actually work. What's other players' tactics for flying enemies? Barret is not currently on my team. Should I use him for this area? My current tactic is mostly Cloud's punisher ability and blocking which gets him to counterstrike when attacked.
    With Cloud, do a dodge roll with circle, then immediately press and hold square. Shoots 1 ranged missile at them and then jumps in to aerial combat mode. You can also just mash square after a dodge roll to do a ranged combo (ATB charges *slow* for that though)

With Tifa in the party use the R1 menu synergy skill to launch her.
Question about doing side quests later! Are there any quests connected to later regions that won’t show up if I don’t complete them in the prior region first? Do side quests affect other quests (other than for >!the golden saucer date!<)? For example, if I don’t do the quest for >!Kyrie!< in the grasslands, would her quest still appear in Junon? If so, are there any dialogue changes in such cases?

(For more bg info, I’m choosing to leave certain side quests until >!after the golden saucer Ferris wheel date in ch12!< bc I want a specific character for it, and I read I could come back and do these side quests later.)
Anyone finding leveling much slower in Rebirth? I’m someone who loves to overlevel and I’ve found even clearing every zone 💯 as I go I’m still not getting too far ahead of the quest line levels. In Chapter 7 and level 30. Just discovered there is no XP Up materia in this game like remake so I’m slightly miffed
[me working from home trying hard not to play Rebirth instead](https://youtu.be/ybW0uDNma14?si=_gZv79v6CbuSnm0U)
Looks like there’s going to be another concert tour… https://kashamaraproductions.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth
The wait continues... Hoping I can finally get this delivered today but so far with no movement since 12pm on Friday... I have a feeling I won't see it till Tuesday 😭 anyone else still suffering in Canada?
Are there any Enemy Skills we obtain the old fashioned way, by getting hit with them to learn the ability? Or is all unlocked through Chadley now?
    It's all through Chadley and assessing enemies.
Is there any use for the HP/MP swap materia? It would effectively give infinite MP, but you'll also die in like a single hit. Is there any possible build that would make it viable or is it mostly a joke/call back to the original game?
I didn't see anyone mention it yet, but I find the new UI very unreadable. Am I the only one having that kind of problem? If so I guess I should fiddle with my display settings
    I don't have that issue. So it may be your display. 

The issue I do take is the redundancy in UI menus. I don't see any point for the upgrade weapons menu to be there because I can just set the weapon skills from the materia & equipment screen. 

The spells screen just tells me what spells are on each character, but I already know this. 

Why have a party screen if editing the party and swapping leader is done from the combat settings screen. 

I feel like they just wanted to fill screen real estate for whatever reason and it's just useless clutter.
The fact that the controls aren't inverted by default for flying the chocobo is possibly the biggest stain on this entire video game. My brain can't comprehend what direction to push when I need to go up or down. I've had to retry the first training course 12 times already. This is crazy.
Can anyone tell me how to activate the weapons vendor in the dustbowl?  I didn’t make a peep or kick a box and he still won’t sell to me
    I also need to know this. I even risked being spoiled by looking it up and still had no answer.
        I got to him my first time and was able to have him show me his wares.  I didn't even know you can knock the stuff over, I just thought he was being a contrast to the Items Vendor next door.

But I went to him again, accidentally knocked stuff over and pissed him off.  I had to wait a long while (I went and got more greens for Piko) before he cooled off and I got to try again.
What the frick are folios?  I have enough going on with materia and weapon upgrades/abilities.  Kind of confusing to throw in another leveling mechanic. 
    It also really gives you little to no customization.  It gives the illusion you can customize your builds.  Its completely linear.
    Think of it like a Sphere grid in ffx, but much smaller in scope
If I had a nickel for every time I had to chase a >!dog!< for a quest. I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.
Will I lose a lot of important things if I don't do all the exploration stuff ? I genuinely love the big open zones in this game but I've played enough Zelda/Genshin and I don't really want to do that again.
Steal is such useless bullshit. Yuffie with 80+ luck and thief-abilities can still fail multiple times in a row on common enemies, lol.
Chadley and his mechanics are the worst part of the gameplay experience outside frustrating mini games.  Everything Chadley makes you do could have been easily part of the world.  They could have filled out those huge quest boards in towns with most of what Chadley wants without having this separate virtual realm.  Then just you know have things and bosses you find on your own and get rewarded for.  I feel like the game devs are treating me like a person who hasnt played a video game once in my life.  Its really offensive and obtuse game design.  Nevermind that he is a bit annoying and does not fit the game world.  I would much prefer finding the summons on my own and fight them right there on the map.  Why it needs to be broken into a simulator makes little to no sense.  It just feels like lazy game design.  There is so many places on the map for there to have been dungeons and caves.  You know like most bigger world rpgs.  It all feels lazy and makes the world lifeless and repetitive.  End rant.  I know the Square can do no wrong fans will downvote me but I had to make a note.  Ive been playing Final Fantasy since the early 90s and RPGs in general.
Chapter 8 with all the forced minigames is stupid
I want to love this game so much and for the most part it's great but I'm not feeling some of the choices they did regarding these semi open wrold parts. I just got to chapter 10 after 40 hours and I am starting to feel the fatigue. Just wanted to rush to my main quest but I have to hunt another chocobo...If there will me more mini games I don't know if I will make it without taking a break from the game for few days lol. I never played the original though so I can't compare. 

Queen's Blood is fire though, always looking forward to new QB rivals.
I'm in chapter 8. 
An without spoiling much 
I'm super annoyed that my entire team just got taken down by regular humans.
The next piano song after Aerith’s is CANCER!!!!
PSA: if you have any present or past carpal tunnel issues this game won't do you any favors!
Any one else downloaded the new content and lost all their progress due to corrupted data? I’ve lost 127 fucking hours so not happy
Is anyone else annoyed by the huge gap between difficulty levels and the general fluctuation in difficulty?

I know this will almost certainly elicit many "git gud" replies but I don't usually struggle with games on medium. For some reason, both Remake and Rebirth have really kicked my ass but I have it particularly bad in Rebirth.

There's a bossfight (I don't want to spoil this, let's just say it's a small team) which totally kicks my ass at medium but if I turn to easy.. I can read my phone and spam attack to go through. 

  
Just to be clear, I'm enjoying the game a lot and I did enjoy the first game (+ the original). It's just that I'd love to have a bit of challenge. I'm sure I'm not the only one who likes a bit of challenge but hates having to grind same fights over and over again.
Can you get rid of you party when riding chocobo's? The wife dislikes the army she's running with and I can't figure out how to get them off screen. She also hates yuffie saying chocobo everytime they hop on
Anyone else have an issue where all of a sudden you can’t sprint/run anymore? I don’t know when I first realized something was off, but at some point Cloud just walked or lightly trotted. Choco’s same deal. I’ve reset all my controllers, uninstalled game, everything I can think of. Nothing much on Rebirth for this issue but looks like remake might have experienced something similar.
Gamespot gave rebirth a 8/10 while the remake was 10/10??😱
    It's possible, there have been complaints about the direction the story was going.
Is it just me or are the minigames brutal? There is a new mini game every few minutes it seems and they are all hard af. Over half my game time so far is just trying to get high scores. I would love to able to skip them but they almost all affect the story and give the best loot, plus I'm a completionist. I have had very little trouble with any fights in the game but some of the mini games have made me consider uninstalling.
As much as I love Queen's blood, I'm getting real sick of my opponents somehow, 90% of the time, just happening to always, **always** draw that one perfect card that ruins my elaborate strategy set up literally right before I can win. Its so fucking cheap.
reviews in just over 20 minutes! xciting! I'm predicting 91 average story
104 reviews and still 93. 90+ for sure
Square Enix, please fucking release my CE preorder. I'm so tired of refreshing UPS
I’d call this an imperfectly perfect game. Yes it’s got some harsh lighting, low textures and some crazy pop in but the charm, story and music all come together so beautiful I don’t care.
Does anyone else feel like there's not enough enemy encounters?  Granted, I'm only about 8 hours into the grasslands area, but it just feels like there should be more enemy groups roaming around.  There's also places that feel as if they should have enemies but don't.  Example; there's access to a beach towards the eastern portion of the region and you could swear that there should be some aquatic type enemies or maybe some larger enemy just waiting to pick a fight, but no.  There's nothing.  Just some round buoys to knock around (and a small island with... stuff).  There's also a ruined building that I was hoping to find at least something to fight. Sadly, nothing again.  I get that groups respawn after a short while, but I'm just hoping the rest of the world map has more encounters.  There's lots to explore, but it feels a bit dull when enemies only seem to show up in certain respawn locations.
This game can eat my whole ass. It should have been a 10/10 but so many little things bring it down to a 7.5 for me.

The bloated overworld is repetitive and boring. The random spike in difficulty between some fights is just frustrating. The fact that there's no inverted aim on some mini games is just astounding. Fuck Chadley. Double fuck MAI. Just shut the fuck up already. So much of interacting with the game just feels clunky and outdated. I can't even remember the other small things that just kept digging in and bringing the game down.

Just beat it and have no motivation to play anymore. Fuck spending another 100 hours to platinum.

OH, WHY THE FUCK DOES BLOCKING BRING UP A MENU AND MAKE AN ANNOYING HIGH PITCHED SOUND? WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA?
    what are you even talking about
Looking at the comments here it seems like people are hating the open world exploration and minigames after a while. Am I the only one still absolutely loving them? I'm in Chapter 10 with 100% completion of areas and don't feel burned out with the sidequests at all. Yeah, some of the minigames were pretty bad (gym) but I thought the rest was  good. This is by far one of the better open world games I've played. Some of the side quests are filler, but a lot of them are meaningful and part of a bigger questline. Maybe the people who don't like them are just burned out because they try to marathon the game and treat 100% completion like a job?
    I'm 100% with you. I usually hate open world games but this one feels varied and also self-contained enough that by the time you get tired of something it's usually already over and you move on to something else (like story or semi-linear dungeon/activity)
    I was okay with the rhythm of open zone into some story back into open zone, but Chapter 4 through 6 was lots of story beats, and then it was very little exploring into more story in 7 and 8.

The last part of 8 was a larger part of the same open zone, and then once you are done, you walk to another region and another entire zone opens up. Doing them back to back like that was roooough.

So now I’m just focusing on getting the story done and I’ll leave the side stuff and exploring as a sort of “endgame” to come back to
IDK about the rest of you but I’m VERY MUCH enjoying re-living my childhood  “best game of all time experience” reimagined!
    Cheers to that. I’m 38 and just like you said….im re-living it. Even just the little things like finding a life spring and hearing the music change gives me chills. 

I’m still 12 hours in and almost wrapped up everything in the grasslands to go through the swamp and the world feels plenty big and beautiful to me. Just taking my time.
Man, so much more negativity in here than I expected. While I understand where a lot of it is coming from, I am afraid to say I can’t relate. 

I find all of the side content meaningful in terms of world-building AND offering rewarding gameplay modifiers. 

There are side character interactions, references to the prior game, and interesting emotional character moments that come from moving through a side quest, not to mention fleshing out the world around you. 

Also, every character seems well realized, including thought-out motivations, character arch’s, appropriate dialogue, and excellent vocal performances all around. They are cartoonish and inflated, but that comes down to taste, how surreal or over the top you like your media. 

The game does not rely too much on exposition, which is more impressive when you consider the source material. 

AND the creators are, if we allow them the space to do so, trying their best to make us FEEL the same way we felt as kids. ASK the same questions!

Not to mention, it has what feels like the best JRPG battle system ever created, if you allow it to be. FLASHY, STRATEGIC, ADRENALINE FILLED, MEANINGFUL, EXPRESSIVE. 

My rants over, but I will end with this:

AM I CRAZY OR US THIS THE BEST JRPG EVER MADE!?
    I am disappointed on how it handled side quest where only 1 specific party member interacts with you. I was hoping to see more party interactions
    I agree for the most part. Anything done to flesh out the world I really appreciate. There have been multiple times where I just stopped in my tracks to admire the scenery and said out loud "wow... I really like this" in regards to new lore and world building.

Then comes random moments – these almost tiny things that I look at and go "just why!?". It's so strange because what they get right they get SO right but when I see the deviations it makes me so aggravated that I almost stop playing immediately. I don't CARE about any new plot they want to shove in – I'm just not here for it.
24 hours to go. For everyone who got the game early, I hope you're having the best time!
    I'll be an "at midnight" player 😆

Booked Thursday and Friday off work too so I have 4 straight days. Need to get the beers in! 

Can't wait.
        Same here. Took 2 days off and bought an additional ''digital'' version next to the physical deluxe edition so I don't need to stress and check my mailbox every 15 minutes on the 29th.

I'm counting down the hours and the clock feels like it's progressing at a snail's pace.
        Me as well! Thursday-Sunday about to be so good!
Can we stop barrels, chairs and tables from flying through the air when we run into them and then permanently lying scattered on the floor inside of buildings.which makes everything look messy. The physics are weird..
    It’s hilarious that you hear your party members trample through them during cut scenes
    Yeah it's kind of funny, but also breaks immersion. They just crash through the place like maniacs kicking over tables and chairs all the time.
Came back here to say that I just experienced the worst fucking section in the game so far.. the Cait Sith mini games. Imagine being in the middle of a story conflict and then the game pauses for a 2hour SHIT mini game section with one of the most irrelevant characters in the game. God damn it it's FF16 all over again
    Most of the criticism of the game is about the bloat in it. I just got done with Kalm and went intonthe open world in the Grasslands last night and I had to sit through like 5 different tutorials in an hour or so...
About 9 chapters in, and I went from being mostly positive to pretty mixed. 

The mandatory minigames are just taking up way too much of the time. I feel like they've been the majority of the past three/four chapters, and I'm just not loving it at all.  

The open world is basically fluff, with very little that's actually unique or interesting to find. It definitely feels behind the times when compared to BoTW and Elden Ring.  

Combat is still fun, but with so few interesting encounters in the world and so many pieces of optimal gear locked behind minigame hi-scores, it feels like it isn't worth taking too seriously. 

At this point, I'm just looking to finish up. Not hoping to 100% anymore.
    That's my fears early doors. I'm feeling potential open world burn. Remake was nice kinda semi linear. Never got dull. But rebirth seems like it could have a lot of boring repetitive open world stuff. I was hoping their would be interesting locations, characters and side quests to discover randomly on my journey but seems not then?


U just get what u get when u go to a tower so spoils even finding anything but not anything to find anyway? Shame


Could've at least took a leaf out red deads book with just being able to stumble upon random people, situations and locations rather than towers to unlock checklists etc. Even newer far cry and ac games done away with that with exploration mode and finding things just by chance.
This game is making me retroactively angrier at ff16. This is so good.
Apologies for the initial technical issues we experience. As usual, New Reddit is the devil.
It's weird that they're so... plastic?  Barrett is such a treat.  He wasn't a favorite of mine in the original but I think he's great here.  Best looking model for sure. 
it's bizarre to me how they complain about the story and give it high scores anyway. Game criticism is still confused about what it even is imo.
    Because most game reviewers understand that games are about gameplay more than story.

I noticed a lot of FF fans seem to really struggle to understand this, but it's a reality.

Do you think Breath of the Wild and Sekiro and Elden Ring won GOTY for their stories? They didn't. They won for their gameplay.

No game is going to get bad reviews if the gameplay is phenomenal. Especially when the experience as a whole is so enjoyable. FF7 Rebirth has, by all accounts, great combat, great mechanics, great music, good exploration, fun side content, and great characters. Of course it's going to get good reviews.

No reviewer is going to give a bad review just because they didn't like the story as much. They might give a *less* good review, but not an actually bad one.

Game criticism isn't confused about what it is. You are confused about what it is. A game should not be reviewed like a movie or a book, it should be reviewed as a game, which means gameplay is enormously important.
        I play final fantasy games for the storylines and the characters. The gameplay is 2nd for me
            Well that's you. And I'm sure there are other people who feel the same.

But a game reviewer would be failing at their job if they gave a game a bad review just for not liking the story when every other aspect of the game is excellent.

Games are defined by gameplay, that's why we call them video *games*. If you want story and characters you can get that from books, movies, TV shows, etc... It's not exclusive to video games. But if you want gameplay, that's something you can only get from a video game. 

You can have a game without a story (Tetris) or almost no story (Mario) and it would still be a game. It could even still be an excellent game. But you literally cannot have a game without gameplay. Gameplay is the single defining trait of what makes a game.

It's also usually the biggest part of the experience. For example, FF16 had about 11 hours of cutscenes total. Now let's be super generous and say Rebirth, which is a 100+ hour game if you do everything, has double what FF16 had and therefore has a whopping 20 hours of cutscenes (highly doubtful). Well even in that case, it would still mean 80% of the experience was gameplay.

And that is why reviewers usually prioritize gameplay. There is nothing surprising or unprofessional about them giving it good reviews despite having some issues with the ending. They're looking at the experience as a whole, and in particular they're looking at what is the biggest and most defining aspect of the game, which is gameplay.

It's cool if you only or mostly care about story, but it just wouldn't make sense for reviewers to treat a game that way. A game is not a book or a movie, you can't discount the fact that the very thing that makes it a game by definition is its gameplay.
    > it's bizarre to me how they complain about the story and give it high scores anyway

adding on to other responses to this, a lot of reviewers loved a lot of the story and characters while criticizing the ending. it doesnt seem like most of them dislike the story as a whole
    I imagine with a game like this you could absolutely despise the changes they are making to the storyline but still review it highly when viewed objectively because it is a technically brilliant game with a (mostly) coherent and compelling story.
Ty for this. Needed something to help me get through work today.
Hahaha amazing! You can spam the heck out of the button too
I haven’t used Tifa much yet. Been playing with the default party haha cloud, Aerith, and red xiii
I love that Mai is even more aggressive than Chadley, and even he starts getting annoyed about it.
I'm in chapter 4 and so far he has remained just as annoying. I can't imagine how they thought having him pop up to talk to you about anything and everything every 5 minutes was a good idea.
    Its the "Current Game Design" meme where your UI is constantly cluttered with Chadley talking to you, even invading your controller to make sure you can't escape him.
    Damn that’s disappointing. I was hoping Ch2 was a bit over the top because it’s introducing the concept to you and all the different types of discoveries but holy hell do I hit this dweeb already haha
Please post anybody who finds a way to mute the little creep.
I'm at the end of chapter 4 and he never stops.  It's so obnoxious.  I'd rather slow walk through boxes.  I assume it's always this way.  I dunno why they thought he was interesting enough to do this with, nor why they think players need this much hand holding.  
    I’m with ya. I just hit Ch5 and I don’t understand why they thought people would want him as the main character. Deal with Sephiroth? Rise up against Shinra? Nah have teenager boy shouting in your ear every 5 seconds telling you what to do while his sister monologues useless info during combat

Love the game. Hate those two
Every single time!  I gotta earn that plume!
I didn't think I'd want to play it much but after spending 20-30 minutes watching a quick guide and reviewing my deck, I'm hooked. Already cleared the first area of opponents, at least I think so, and I want to advanced to the next area if only to play more
Petition for QB online!!
I've done that before and never got mine early. I think the chance of you being one of the lucky few is slim. I even had a copy arrive late once so as much as we wish we were playing early at least you know at 11:00 pm cst on Wednesday your unhealthy obsession for the foreseeable future begins. Monday, Tuesday, and half of Wednesday are going to feel pretty long I imagine.
There's also a chance it would get delivered late.
I don’t understand how it’s 2024 and the games industry seems to just keep reinventing UI. We’ve had decades of amazing examples of UI design. Not talking art style, but I would have expected good UI design to be ubiquitous at this point.
Is he 19” of 21”? I have a space I may need to tweak for him and I’m also waiting for mine to arrive to make an unboxing video for you all! Thanks!
I put down the music/sfx to 6 and I have dialogues up to 10 just so I can hear more clearly.
Oh definitely. Immediately thought this when a QB match ends and the person says ... something ... but the music is just gongin.
 I am 24 hours in and I just finished 100%ing Grasslands and 2nd area. Currently in Chapter 4. I actually enjoyed 95% of it too. 

 But I am thinking it might be time to continue the main story for at least a couple chapters because I am currently 2 levels above the recommended level for the story.
Unfortunately those days are long gone.  The closest thing you'll get is the Remake Ultimania, which did have a guide.  But that was released well after release, and only in Japanese.
IGN does a few minor guides upon release. it usually doesn't take "too long" for someone to post a guide to gamefaqs. there were a few different ones i used for my 2nd playthrough of Remake. here are the ones i enjoyed:

[https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/168653-final-fantasy-vii-remake/faqs/78875](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/168653-final-fantasy-vii-remake/faqs/78875)

also, who cares. don't let anybody shit on the way you like to play the game. it's a single player, offline game. enjoy it how you want to man.
Dude, I am the same as you. 37 years old, just best remake and intergrade last 4 weeks. I played FF16 before, but I should have played crisis core like u lol.

This game is such a massive part of my childhood too, it’s crazy. So excited to play part 2 in 20 mins
Two Girls One Cloud is my usual party setup too. 

Barret and Red feel like they belong together. Their deep love of the planet forms a bond. 

This game has made me realize how superfluous all the other characters are.
Yeah ikr I was trying to take some good shots of Tifa’s badonkadonks in Costa del Sol but no dice
I mean, I’d stay off most places on the internet if you’re worried about spoilers! I remember getting spoiled due to an Amazon review once.  

I’ve just kind of made my peace with spoilers. They’re going to happen no matter how hard I try to avoid them, spoilers ultimately don’t ruin the gameplay or journey!
I feel like the key is knowing the songs.  This is my favorite mini game because I love so much of the music.  
Make me.
Oh they made me rage. The decision to use the haptic feedback was just a headscratcher imo, had to disable it after my 5th or 6th try as it was starting to kill my wrists.

Fuck those half trigger pulls they threw in there too.
I had to turn off the haptic triggers for the crunches.. made it 10x easier
What's bad about it out of curiosity? I'm not there yet but have seen that complaint a lot and some of these minigames have annoyed me.
Haha, same. I got Remake early so I wasn't expecting issues here, but here I am at the end of the working day before release day, with no updates on my order beyond "Awaiting Fulfilment" since 2 weeks ago.

I expected it wouldn't arrive early on release day so I'm still working tomorrow, but I booked Friday and Monday off work. First time I've booked time off work for a game in many years. If it doesn't arrive tomorrow I'll be very tempted to buy the digital version too, but spending an extra $70 for the sake of a few extra days playing does seem silly...
I did this with ffxvi. Dont do it, it wont be worth it I guarantee you

Youll likely get it a day late at max. If you ordered day one shipping and it says label created itll likely update today.
>ease my CE preorder. I

me too. My eta is monday! I wanna play this weekend fuck waiting.
I gave up and moved it to easy for that.
generally camera is out of place, durning walking/fight it can also stuck behind tree/rock.
Camera is too close in general and at a weird angle legit my only problem w the game
My biggest criticism of the game is the pacing. I'm on chapter 10 right now. There's way too many mini games that lock rewards and gear behind them. I do like the mini games but again there's just way too many and then you're pressured into doing them which makes the story come to a screeching halt. The thing I like the most about the game is the combat, and the character writing.
    I keep hearing that and now I'm actually dreading progressing further into the game. Why the fuck would they make mini games mandatory for story progression and locking the bulk of items to them? Just pointless padding but that's just modern day gaming in a nutshell.
I’m disappointed, but I’m still enjoying it. It’s too difficult at times, and the side quests suck. There’s too much crap on the map, and pointless things at that. Plus, there are too many bad mini games.

I expected it to be amazing
There's a very significant shift that begins to creep in around chapter 5, where the pacing slows and things start to revolve more and more about mandatory minigames. 

This eventually reverts back, but the whole middle chunk of the game is minigame central and I think a lot of people are turned off by that.
I’m just starting chapter 10 and rarely use them. I just forget they’re there!
Sadly 92 now. But still pretty high score!
Yeah, I noticed the blatant padding as well in some areas. I don't mind it so far because it's usually short enough to not bother me, but I do notice when I'm doing things for the sake of just being busy but not really achieving anything.
I don't mind the quests, but my big complaint are these weird sequences that consist of pushing carts, doing the L2+R2 thing, plugging in cables, etc. I just don't understand how someone can think these sequences are fun. The game would be so much better if all of these were removed.
    I think its to sort of involve your self in the world its basically puzzles? but not really.
        Yeah I think that's the intention, but for me it does the opposite. It just annoys me.
Mine just updated as well and says the 29th too! Gives me time to prep so I can film and upload the unboxing on YouTube!
My tracking number just updated too and it’s giving me a March 1 delivery date 😭
    Cast haste!
it just scales the enemies to your level so you can’t over level content
Yes it does, Square Enix said there will be patch for that  
[https://twitter.com/Genki\_JPN/status/1764105144260817209](https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1764105144260817209)
I beat it with a 50 and then fell right at the last second.  Luckily it counted right before.  That and Fort Condor are so so so bad. 
Yeah right after Junon is when I stopped caring for completionist and decided to leave it as my endgame. There was a particular part where they theow two regions at you back to back with not story inbetween and I was like nahhhh
I agree with you. I think if you try and be a completionist throughout, it really takes away from the pacing of the story. I think I'm going to do a few of the important things in each region and leave the rest for me to catch up on at the end of the game.

With that being said though, are you walking everywhere on foot or something? I did absolutely everything (as far as I know) in Kalm, Grasslands, Junon Region, and Under Junon and I think I was at like 14-15 hours as I entered Upper Junon. And I am not a fast player by any stretch. Dont forget you can fast travel to any of the event locations you've already visited!
Oh man if you think Max sucks then don't watch the ProJared stream lol. 

I like Jared for his reactions to the story beats, but my god his gameplay is just the worst sometimes.  

It took him until maybe junon before he figured out how to use basic synergy abilities and is now in costa del sol but STILL doesn't understand cloud's ranged/air move-set.
That's actually a fair criticism of Max, I love how much he loves FF7, but I learned during the Elden Ring playthrough that he is really bad at RPGs, his FGC mind just wants to fight things as soon as he can and spend hours doing it which is fine, but annoying when he is ignoring things that can make it so much easier for him.

That said I don't know if I have a great answer, but I've been watching Rogersbase mainly for his reactions to the story, but he seems pretty competent at the game based on me skipping through the VODs.
The problem isn't stealth mini games, the problem is that it's a bad minigame and you're forced to interact with it
It was not.
Yes it is.
Now I wish I got the Collector's Edition and wasn't a broke bitch. :,)
Mine has not moved from the Vegas UPS store since the 25th when they “received” it. My delivery date was supposed to be by last night at 7pm here in Ohio. That did not happen and my delivery date has now shifted to Monday. I opened a ticket with Square because the expectation for spending $300 on a game is that I can play it on release day. So this is ridiculous. I’m going through them first as their customer service is better than UPS so depending on their answer I’ll file a claim with UPS after.
I just called UPS, new estimated date is march 5th even though March 1st was on an email they just sent last night.  They have nothing they can say except "its in transit"  Also stuckin Vegas
As far as I can tell it only affects whether you spawn on foot or on a chocobo. But yeah, if that's the case it seems like a pointless step.
    not really pointless, if you travel to a city/area you need to walk at spawning on a chocobo is needless r1 to get off.

Spawning in an area in the middle of the map you need a chocobo for it would require you to call, wait for it to arrive then hop on it before you go anywhere
So far as I can tell I think it's just an option for what you spawn in the new location with. So if you choose chocobo you'll arrive and be on your chocobo as opposed to on foot. A small difference I think as it only saves you a few seconds of calling out your chocobo anyway.
Fully agree, this games ost needs to be in talks for best of all time imo
I'm not very good at it, but it seems like you gotta think of it more of a tap than a full push. You gotta be gentle on the piano keys, not slam your fingers down.
he wouldnt have died anyway but i agree, its tropey and shit
    Speaking of demo, in tifas room for the flashback, is the music page supposed to not be there?
        Let me clarify, it was there for the demo but I don't see it in the main game
That one scene is, objectively, extremely poorly directed. From having you limp through the town incredibly slowly, to forcing a detour while you're already oh so incredibly slow, to that section that's borderline comical it is so stupid to look at.

For a mercy, (very nearly) EVERYTHING FUCKING ELSE about the game is stellar and I have seen absolutely nothing even REMOTELY that badly paced further ahead.

It's a shame they fumbled such an iconic scene, even I can think of several ways to make it much more engaging and immersion without dragging (LITERALLY!) quite as much, and I'm a dumbapple.
    Being forced to limp through that section made me want to throw my controller at the screen 😭 like goddamn man I thought they lessened the padding. Love the game so far but after chapter one I actually stopped for the night.
I'm beating remake on hard and getting as any trophies as I can until my preorder from best buy shows up.
Thats kind of a thing with most ff games imo. 10 had a ton of random things you could fuck off doing despite the game being in “world is ending” plot mode for like 40 hours. As much as I love FF stories, the pacings are often all over the place. 

Tbh I find that to be a criticism of most very long RPG games. As much as I enjoyed BG3, the pacing during act 3 was a fucking ride lmao. I bring that up because it’s a recent example where I felt what you are feeling
Oh man, in Remake that warehouse ghosts chapter was one of the worst pacing decisions of any game. We're like "OH NO THE TOWER IS BEING ATTACKED HURRY", but then we take a long pause to learn the story of the ghosts in some random warehouse with slow somber scenes?
my deluxe is still awaiting fulfilment , just received a text from DPD about a delivery and im not expecting anything else
\*UPDATE\* as per my previous post I now have full tracking via DPD on a package, no info from square enix site yet ( still says awaiting fulfilment ) Is shipping via  chronopost out of chilly mazarin france to DPD Ireland.
Same, im so anxious

I read some ppl received remake without any notice from squareenix...
Samesies. I'm hoping they ship today. If not, i can wait.
Same, but I got a UPS tracking # in email. It originally showed March 1, but now it's showing March 4...
Mine's not arriving till Friday.

>Happened last time and happening again. It just feels so awful...

I think they had a pretty good excuse last time, given that the world had an unprecedented complete shut down that month.
12h to work to go.....
I feel you, I have a late evening shift today and tomorrow so I probably won’t get chance to really sink my teeth into it until saturday
Similar but different! Mine recognized the demo clear data but not the Remake or DLC clear data and it's giving me the 'No eligible saved data is found' error. What gives??
    Same
same :(
Same status since Sunday, ETA is still tomorrow
I’ve got the CE from the square store. Normal shipping. Last update was the 25th that they received the package in Nevada and it’s in transit 5 days now. “Arriving today by 7pm”. 

I have a coworker with the same exact situation. Since I want to film the unboxing, he will give me his if it comes in early and I give him mine if it comes in late. He got it digital too so he can play on time.
    This is the exact situation I’m in. Last update was the 25th that UPS has the package in Nevada. I’m well far away from Nevada and says it’ll be here by 7pm today. We’ll see I guess…. Good luck to you
Lol I noticed her too
Deck building is definitely hard. I think you are meant to lose queens blood more often than not. At a certain point they give you “queens blood puzzles” (basically give you 3 cards and tell you to win the board in 3 turns) and it made me think about the game a little more. There’s probably a lot of depth to get out of the game but I’ve just been using the same strategy and hitting reset if I think I’ll lose
I mean tbf Assassin's Creed's popularising of the reconnaissance tower concept is one of the biggest tropes in modern gaming. The director of the first two Assassin's Creed games has even jokingly apologised for all the recon towers in every single open world game.
Chadley is lowkey hilarious.
Gongaga made me quit the game.  That, and the Ubisoft levels of pointlessness and boring nature of the side content.  It's good for one, maybe 2 areas.  By Costa Del Sol, I was thoroughly tired of the open world waypoints.  By Gongaga, I wanted to cry.


I love the combat.  I love the characters and story.  But damn, I don't think I'll ever finish it.
It's cool to hear a newcomer's perspective
it solves the old tale of if i do too many sidequests ill overlevel for main story
We haven't had access to that difficulty but I suspect it means you can over level and if you come back to a missed side quest it scales up.
I imagine it's like FF8, where enemies scale up with you. I hope that enemies have a base level though, so it can't be cheesed like FF8.
From what I've seen nobody with overnight shipping has left awaiting fulfillment yet, im thinking they hand them off to carriers later than normal orders because the carriers handle the faster shipping anyway
They've been restocked multiple times the past few days through Amazon/Best Buy/Gamestop. Follow wario64 on Twitter and he'll post when it goes live somewhere for you to order.
    Well there's my problem, I keep checking Square's store.
        Yeah. I got an order from gamestop in yesterday. Would've preferred best buy but that's one got restocked. The best buy got restocked an hour after I ordered. Oh well haha
Watch max he got plans on playing it
Don't know how fast she uploads but check "Julia_tv". I just recently discovered her through youtube recommendations and she just recently did a FF7 Remake blind playthrough (She has no knowledge at all as to the OG, Crisis Core, Advent Children or any other older FF7 product so its a completely blind playthrough). 

She even uploaded her playing the demos and it was so entertaining watch her be so amused at "Cloud"'s mannerisms during the Nibelheim flashback (again she has no prior knowledge)

She also said she is looking forward to Rebirth.
Some of its already up from the Vinyl OST, there was even some of the music from the demo someone uploaded but I can't find it.
CE, Florida, March 1st 😞
by thursday for me. hoping itll ship soon, im getting anxious
My order still hasn’t moved. Crossing my fingers that tomorrow’s the day, otherwise I’m assuming I won’t get to play until this weekend :(
Best Buy charged me too after an almost heart attack of receiving an email that the authorization failed and I have 24 hours to update it.
Same! Packaging my Item is what it says on the page.
Armor and accessories don't matter at all. They aren't even cosmetic (as far as I know.)

Moogle Trio Summon you can get by pre-ordering standard edition from PSN store.

Do you care about digital artwork and soundtrack? Personally, I don't. There's gonna be plenty of artwork available for free and the entire soundtrack will be on Spotify/Youtube Music.

That just leaves the Magic Pot Summon. Not worth $20.
    Dude, thank you for this info. Sounds like I'm going to save some $$ now.
I think it looks better than it did in the demo, but it's still not super sharp. However, I definitely think the silky smooth 60fps is worth it.
Nope
Same here 😅
Keep going. At a certain point a prompt will come up. I will say once you get to the Cloud crawling on the ground scene don't skip or you will end up in Kalm.
    I got there. Thanks for the heads up!
Crisis core spoils a major plot point that should only be revealed much later in Rebirth or even maybe part 3. So IMO, don't touch it
They deepen character bonds and that will impact story scenes later
theres some good dialogue with party members during some quests, but besides money and xp
Assessing enemies, specifically the Battle Intel ones, unlocks new challenges in the Battle Simulator which gives you special Materia. Stuff like Enemy Skill (the whole Materia itself *and* the ability to learn the moves) comes from there. Personally, I'm about to unlock what is so far the only Elemental I've seen, which is in one of the Simulator battles unlocked in the Junon region.

Also, the side quests are massively improved (so far); each one features Cloud+A Party Member and deepens their bond. Not only that, but the NPCs are more interesting this time around, and the quest itself usually teaches you something about the world. For instance, in the Junon area, there is a quest involving a creature we knew about in OG but got very little background on. This quest completely revolves around that creature. If you want to know, it's the >!Condor from Fort Condor.!<

Anyway, this game is *about* the world, and that shines through in the side content. Not every single thing is premium content, but it is very enjoyable and very impressive considering SE's track record.
    I really like how the new Enemy Skill works. You don't need to do any weird shit to manipulate enemies or get them to attack your one specific character, instead you just gotta explore, scan enemies, and  then do the region's specific battle simulator. So much more fun and feels like some clear linear progress too.
Gasp, your posterity
What's the point of any of the crafting. 

Just collecting stuff as I run around I never have enough for making the items I need.
There are moments in the game where the gang is just standing around doing their own thing like when you get to Kalm. Only check in on the person you want to go on the date with, unless MSQ forces it, and they will always be ahead of the party.
Same. It's difficult for me to keep my eye on both wheels. Might be easier if I sat closer to my monitor.
I've heard a lot of people suggest turning note speed up
Her and Chadley. I'll do all the tedious side content, but Jesus, I don't need a long annoying discussion every time I check something off the list.
Somewhere in settings, you have to scroll down to the last option. It only turns MAI off when you repeat a fiend hunt, not the first time, but better than nothing. Fucking insane whoever thought this was a good idea.
So, I actually saw this comment *before* I got to this part of the game, and saw a few others talking about this section too. NGL, I was dreading it and worried I'd take a break. The doom and gloom about this section had me worried.

So, I got to that point a few days ago and it was over in like...idk like 30-45m? So I figured "surely, there must be more. This must be why Redditors were so angry."

Nope. Just that 1 section. It's also very easy. Was box-throwing the most engaging mechanic? No. But is it cool that they took a sub character and fleshed him out enough to have his own solo-playable section? I think so.

It really wasn't bad. If you're letting a minor section of the game completely ruin the whole thing for you, maybe it's best to take a break from screens for a while to get some fresh air and perspective.
    It's not that single fcking thing man


Look we have a ff game with open world? Fck yea, what the devs do with this open world? Fcking nothing 


All regions boil down to the same stupid stuff, climb 6 towers go pres triangle at these springs, etc.. It's worse than the actual ubisoft copy paste stuff, there is barely anything to do in open world.. Let's look at the other stuff. Mini games, there is more attention being paid to mini games than the world and story combined 


Who asked for all of these? Like we solve most stuff with mini games, it gets boring real fast 


Don't even start me with the story and it makes no sense at all, like seriously how they approved some of the stuff is beyond me 


That part of the game is just extra boring 
I agree the lighting is bad. First instance is when you talk to Tifa in Kalm about the watertower

They did say though that a patch was coming to fix the graphics in performance mode (they specifically mentioned that they heard people complained that the faces were "scary" in some scenes due to lighting. Yes the word "scary" was used)
It’s fine, really. Before you know it the game will be a month or two old and the sub will be back to being inundated with twelve separate theory threads per day.
    Don't forget the Tifa cosplays!
your save doesn't carry over. once you get partly up Mt. Nibel the game comes up with a prompt saying you have a demo save file and asking if you'd like to skip the demo portion. if you click yes it starts you right after the burning village sequence
or theyre just running behind. this is happening to several people. that is far from a possibility tbh. Id wait a day or two before coming to that conlcusion
I don't like hard mode trophies in general for open world games. It's ok with mission based or straightforward chapter based but if I'm expected to spend 150 hours on the first playthrough, asking me to do it again for a trophy is too much for me.
lmao yeah it's painful. I'm also playing in a language I'm slow at reading (not my native language) and sometimes it hurts. Also fun fact, if you save before the dialogue and try again, the choices are shuffled and not always in the same position so you still need to figure out where the correct one is and I always panic.
I thought the same, but they used it already for the crisis core remaster and that would be redundant if used twice. 
Been used.  I'm going with Remembrance.
    Revengence.
I agree. Instead of having him stay with his physical character of a 40+ something hunan year dog that only changes his demeanors to his real teen dog age with those who are near and dear to him, they literally change his physical voice to a teen.

This over simplification ruins the nuances of his character.
THIS! 

It is egregious. An actual crime against sound mixing. It'd be one thing if it held notes of the initial voice we get from Red but sounds on every level both wrong. I honestly (when it happened) thought it was a flub or error but nope. It was intentional. The person who decided that was the voice of Nanaki should be banned. (Not the VA mind you, the person who said "that is the performance I want").
STOP THE COUNT!
Any save file, I believe. I only did one playthrough of Intermission and it transferred over. However, it needs to check your save files each time you start a news game.
the level cap is 70
    Thank you. Do you know what the start Level is?
        it's somewhere around 15-20, sorry not exactly sure
I use the default Cloud-Aerith-Red as well since Red's Vengeance Mode and Aerith's Radiant Ward lasers feel too good to pass up, but I swapped Cloud out for Barret for all the VR fights including Phoenix. I don't think I'm gonna be able to stick with just one party in the full game, I love everyone's playstyle.
Cloud/Red/Aerith is the most broken. You can solo Phoenix with Red lol
You get a summon materia, >!Leviathan!< and then you get >!Ramuh!< if you played the DLC as well.
No delay just been sitting at shipping label created for a couple weeks. Hoping it moves today. I want to play this weekend.
Twin package has both games, rebirth & remake.

Basically you are getting remake for free
    Sweet, I’ll get that one. Thanks! 
there likely won't be an upgrade path, there wasn't for Remake. the only way would be to cancel your preorder and then re-purchase the deluxe but technically due to PS Store policy you shouldn't be able to cancel due to pre-load. if you message support and get a nice agent they'll probably cancel for you after explaining
I have work at 4.30am until 3pm u jammy git
Same status (Ready for Pickup, Available for pickup on  Thursday)! We might have to wait for the email before pickup but i guess sometimes that depends on your local Best Buy.
Yes! Same boat but it says UPS has the package since the 25th. Opened a claim to see WTH is going on.
Just take your time finishing Remake. There’s no reason to rush into Rebirth. You also need to play Intergrade before Rebirth
oh my gosh.. I got my best buy deluxe edition from Hotstocks on 2/21 and its set to arrive tomorrow. also from Ohio and its currently in my city. I hope your estimated arrival changes soon
    Thanks. Oh dang. Me too lol. I was a bit bothered that BB wouldn't let me pick up at store or send to store. 

I suppose I can try and finish FF16 by Tuesday before Rebirth gets here. Avoiding spoilers will be difficult.
looking at timestamps you might not need this info anymore, but for me it was about 25 minutes to install the data disc and an update triggered by the play disc
Same issue.
Based on how Remake was packaged the game (wrapped in cellophane) is in the Deluxe Edition Box, however the area where the bar code would be (on the game not the Deluxe Edition Box) states "Not for Resale". Looks like you'll have to resort to Facebook Marketplace as stores need an actual bar code to make a return.
My deluxe says not for resale where the upc would normally be on the “normal” game box
mine does come with the wrap but also says not for resale without a barcode. im in US
Hmm I'm not sure about the tutorial but if you want a really quick explanation, here it goes:

- turn based card game, you go first, enemy goes after, then your turn again, etc

- you can only place cards on the tiles with green pips, according to the cost (if there's 1 pip, only cards with 1 pip cost can be placed)

- enemy can only place cards on tiles with red pips

- each card has a pattern that can unlock more green pips (or override the enemy's red pips with your green pips) so you can expand the area where you can place your cards (your "territory")

- pips in each tile can "accumulate", so if you have two cards on the table whose patterns overlap on one tile, that tile will become a 2-pip tile, etc

- each card has a number as its score. Scores are summed per row at the end of the game, the player with the highest score **per row** will get that entire score on its scoreboard (so if you have 6 points and the enemy has 5 points in one row, you get the full 6 points and the enemy gets 0!)

- Whoever has the most points at the end wins, game ends when both players pass (usually when there's no more places to place cards)

- Cards can have bonuses like increasing the score of adjacent cards, or reducing the score of adjacent cards (if score goes below 0, the card is destroyed. This can be used to "kill" enemy cards)

- Some cards have special abilities. Press the touchpad when you're on a card and you can see a description of what they can do

- At the beginning of the game, you can choose how many cards in your first hand to discard if you don't like them, you will draw an equal amount of cards afterwards to compensate

tl;dr - gain territory by placing cards on the tiles until the enemy cannot place their cards anymore, the one with more points wins
Yo unlock the service at the Junon ranch.
Graphics mode in the first playthrough. It’s too gorgeous to play on performance
Yes, there are several parts where the party splits up and you are forced to play with only certain party members. I think it's a good idea to regularly shuffle members around just to get familiar with the playstyle of each. Keep in mind that materia AP gain (and also regular XP gain) is shared even among non-active members so it's in your interest to keep all of them properly equipped with all kinds of materia and good gear. I usually don't like having a large roster of characters in JRPGs cause it's a pain in the ass to keep all of them up-to-level but so far this has been really effortless.
Yup fuck the sit up mini game. Not wasting anymore time on it.
Using the same TV and not experiencing your issue
Use synergy abilities. The charged attack with Tifa instantly charges almost 2 full ATB bars for me.
With Cloud, do a dodge roll with circle, then immediately press and hold square. Shoots 1 ranged missile at them and then jumps in to aerial combat mode. You can also just mash square after a dodge roll to do a ranged combo (ATB charges *slow* for that though)

With Tifa in the party use the R1 menu synergy skill to launch her.
It's all through Chadley and assessing enemies.
I don't have that issue. So it may be your display. 

The issue I do take is the redundancy in UI menus. I don't see any point for the upgrade weapons menu to be there because I can just set the weapon skills from the materia & equipment screen. 

The spells screen just tells me what spells are on each character, but I already know this. 

Why have a party screen if editing the party and swapping leader is done from the combat settings screen. 

I feel like they just wanted to fill screen real estate for whatever reason and it's just useless clutter.
I also need to know this. I even risked being spoiled by looking it up and still had no answer.
    I got to him my first time and was able to have him show me his wares.  I didn't even know you can knock the stuff over, I just thought he was being a contrast to the Items Vendor next door.

But I went to him again, accidentally knocked stuff over and pissed him off.  I had to wait a long while (I went and got more greens for Piko) before he cooled off and I got to try again.
It also really gives you little to no customization.  It gives the illusion you can customize your builds.  Its completely linear.
Think of it like a Sphere grid in ffx, but much smaller in scope
It's possible, there have been complaints about the direction the story was going.
what are you even talking about
I'm 100% with you. I usually hate open world games but this one feels varied and also self-contained enough that by the time you get tired of something it's usually already over and you move on to something else (like story or semi-linear dungeon/activity)
I was okay with the rhythm of open zone into some story back into open zone, but Chapter 4 through 6 was lots of story beats, and then it was very little exploring into more story in 7 and 8.

The last part of 8 was a larger part of the same open zone, and then once you are done, you walk to another region and another entire zone opens up. Doing them back to back like that was roooough.

So now I’m just focusing on getting the story done and I’ll leave the side stuff and exploring as a sort of “endgame” to come back to
Cheers to that. I’m 38 and just like you said….im re-living it. Even just the little things like finding a life spring and hearing the music change gives me chills. 

I’m still 12 hours in and almost wrapped up everything in the grasslands to go through the swamp and the world feels plenty big and beautiful to me. Just taking my time.
I am disappointed on how it handled side quest where only 1 specific party member interacts with you. I was hoping to see more party interactions
I agree for the most part. Anything done to flesh out the world I really appreciate. There have been multiple times where I just stopped in my tracks to admire the scenery and said out loud "wow... I really like this" in regards to new lore and world building.

Then comes random moments – these almost tiny things that I look at and go "just why!?". It's so strange because what they get right they get SO right but when I see the deviations it makes me so aggravated that I almost stop playing immediately. I don't CARE about any new plot they want to shove in – I'm just not here for it.
I'll be an "at midnight" player 😆

Booked Thursday and Friday off work too so I have 4 straight days. Need to get the beers in! 

Can't wait.
    Same here. Took 2 days off and bought an additional ''digital'' version next to the physical deluxe edition so I don't need to stress and check my mailbox every 15 minutes on the 29th.

I'm counting down the hours and the clock feels like it's progressing at a snail's pace.
    Me as well! Thursday-Sunday about to be so good!
It’s hilarious that you hear your party members trample through them during cut scenes
Yeah it's kind of funny, but also breaks immersion. They just crash through the place like maniacs kicking over tables and chairs all the time.
Most of the criticism of the game is about the bloat in it. I just got done with Kalm and went intonthe open world in the Grasslands last night and I had to sit through like 5 different tutorials in an hour or so...
That's my fears early doors. I'm feeling potential open world burn. Remake was nice kinda semi linear. Never got dull. But rebirth seems like it could have a lot of boring repetitive open world stuff. I was hoping their would be interesting locations, characters and side quests to discover randomly on my journey but seems not then?


U just get what u get when u go to a tower so spoils even finding anything but not anything to find anyway? Shame


Could've at least took a leaf out red deads book with just being able to stumble upon random people, situations and locations rather than towers to unlock checklists etc. Even newer far cry and ac games done away with that with exploration mode and finding things just by chance.
Because most game reviewers understand that games are about gameplay more than story.

I noticed a lot of FF fans seem to really struggle to understand this, but it's a reality.

Do you think Breath of the Wild and Sekiro and Elden Ring won GOTY for their stories? They didn't. They won for their gameplay.

No game is going to get bad reviews if the gameplay is phenomenal. Especially when the experience as a whole is so enjoyable. FF7 Rebirth has, by all accounts, great combat, great mechanics, great music, good exploration, fun side content, and great characters. Of course it's going to get good reviews.

No reviewer is going to give a bad review just because they didn't like the story as much. They might give a *less* good review, but not an actually bad one.

Game criticism isn't confused about what it is. You are confused about what it is. A game should not be reviewed like a movie or a book, it should be reviewed as a game, which means gameplay is enormously important.
    I play final fantasy games for the storylines and the characters. The gameplay is 2nd for me
        Well that's you. And I'm sure there are other people who feel the same.

But a game reviewer would be failing at their job if they gave a game a bad review just for not liking the story when every other aspect of the game is excellent.

Games are defined by gameplay, that's why we call them video *games*. If you want story and characters you can get that from books, movies, TV shows, etc... It's not exclusive to video games. But if you want gameplay, that's something you can only get from a video game. 

You can have a game without a story (Tetris) or almost no story (Mario) and it would still be a game. It could even still be an excellent game. But you literally cannot have a game without gameplay. Gameplay is the single defining trait of what makes a game.

It's also usually the biggest part of the experience. For example, FF16 had about 11 hours of cutscenes total. Now let's be super generous and say Rebirth, which is a 100+ hour game if you do everything, has double what FF16 had and therefore has a whopping 20 hours of cutscenes (highly doubtful). Well even in that case, it would still mean 80% of the experience was gameplay.

And that is why reviewers usually prioritize gameplay. There is nothing surprising or unprofessional about them giving it good reviews despite having some issues with the ending. They're looking at the experience as a whole, and in particular they're looking at what is the biggest and most defining aspect of the game, which is gameplay.

It's cool if you only or mostly care about story, but it just wouldn't make sense for reviewers to treat a game that way. A game is not a book or a movie, you can't discount the fact that the very thing that makes it a game by definition is its gameplay.
> it's bizarre to me how they complain about the story and give it high scores anyway

adding on to other responses to this, a lot of reviewers loved a lot of the story and characters while criticizing the ending. it doesnt seem like most of them dislike the story as a whole
I imagine with a game like this you could absolutely despise the changes they are making to the storyline but still review it highly when viewed objectively because it is a technically brilliant game with a (mostly) coherent and compelling story.
Its the "Current Game Design" meme where your UI is constantly cluttered with Chadley talking to you, even invading your controller to make sure you can't escape him.
Damn that’s disappointing. I was hoping Ch2 was a bit over the top because it’s introducing the concept to you and all the different types of discoveries but holy hell do I hit this dweeb already haha
I’m with ya. I just hit Ch5 and I don’t understand why they thought people would want him as the main character. Deal with Sephiroth? Rise up against Shinra? Nah have teenager boy shouting in your ear every 5 seconds telling you what to do while his sister monologues useless info during combat

Love the game. Hate those two
I keep hearing that and now I'm actually dreading progressing further into the game. Why the fuck would they make mini games mandatory for story progression and locking the bulk of items to them? Just pointless padding but that's just modern day gaming in a nutshell.
I think its to sort of involve your self in the world its basically puzzles? but not really.
    Yeah I think that's the intention, but for me it does the opposite. It just annoys me.
Cast haste!
not really pointless, if you travel to a city/area you need to walk at spawning on a chocobo is needless r1 to get off.

Spawning in an area in the middle of the map you need a chocobo for it would require you to call, wait for it to arrive then hop on it before you go anywhere
Speaking of demo, in tifas room for the flashback, is the music page supposed to not be there?
    Let me clarify, it was there for the demo but I don't see it in the main game
Being forced to limp through that section made me want to throw my controller at the screen 😭 like goddamn man I thought they lessened the padding. Love the game so far but after chapter one I actually stopped for the night.
Same
This is the exact situation I’m in. Last update was the 25th that UPS has the package in Nevada. I’m well far away from Nevada and says it’ll be here by 7pm today. We’ll see I guess…. Good luck to you
Well there's my problem, I keep checking Square's store.
    Yeah. I got an order from gamestop in yesterday. Would've preferred best buy but that's one got restocked. The best buy got restocked an hour after I ordered. Oh well haha
Dude, thank you for this info. Sounds like I'm going to save some $$ now.
I got there. Thanks for the heads up!
I really like how the new Enemy Skill works. You don't need to do any weird shit to manipulate enemies or get them to attack your one specific character, instead you just gotta explore, scan enemies, and  then do the region's specific battle simulator. So much more fun and feels like some clear linear progress too.
It's not that single fcking thing man


Look we have a ff game with open world? Fck yea, what the devs do with this open world? Fcking nothing 


All regions boil down to the same stupid stuff, climb 6 towers go pres triangle at these springs, etc.. It's worse than the actual ubisoft copy paste stuff, there is barely anything to do in open world.. Let's look at the other stuff. Mini games, there is more attention being paid to mini games than the world and story combined 


Who asked for all of these? Like we solve most stuff with mini games, it gets boring real fast 


Don't even start me with the story and it makes no sense at all, like seriously how they approved some of the stuff is beyond me 


That part of the game is just extra boring 
Don't forget the Tifa cosplays!
Revengence.
Thank you. Do you know what the start Level is?
    it's somewhere around 15-20, sorry not exactly sure
Sweet, I’ll get that one. Thanks! 
Thanks. Oh dang. Me too lol. I was a bit bothered that BB wouldn't let me pick up at store or send to store. 

I suppose I can try and finish FF16 by Tuesday before Rebirth gets here. Avoiding spoilers will be difficult.
