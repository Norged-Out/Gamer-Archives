[IGN: 9/10](https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review)

>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion, both as a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenges and an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long.

[VGC: 5/5](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/final-fantasy-7-rebirth/)

>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is an excellent RPG with some of the best characters in the gaming canon. While some open-world content skirts the edges, and the game's main narrative is left somewhat deflated, the time spent with Aerith, Tifa, and the gang makes this a hugely enjoyable road trip you'll be playing for hundreds of hours.

[TheSixthAxis: 9/10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/)

>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a beautifully crafted experience that fans old and new will absolutely love. It almost goes too far in correcting the first game's linearity with broad open areas stuffed with things to do, but there's also key additions to the combat, and the story running through this middle chapter is masterfully retold. Really the biggest problem you'll have once the credits roll is knowing that it will be far too many years before we can finish the trilogy.

[Washington Post: 10/10](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review/)

>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is so good, it nearly wrecked my life.

[NME: 10/10](https://www.nme.com/reviews/game-reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-3590691)

>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth breathes new life into one of the most revered games of all time. A vastly richer open world ensures your time in Gaia is thoroughly engrossing, while Cloud’s story is as gripping as it was in 1997.

[IGN Japan: 10/10](https://jp.ign.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-2/73595/review/vii)

>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is packed with well-crafted content, and unlike its predecessor, none of it feels like filler. While Cloud’s new and unknown journey isn’t finished just yet, Rebirth already delivers an emotional story that could have only been achieved with a remake. While a small amount of the minigames can be tedious, from exploration to battle, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a top-notch experience. It delivers a surprising amount of quality, quantity and diversity in its content, to the extent that there pretty much isn’t anything like it.

[Destructoid: 9.5/10](https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth/)

>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth somehow manages to spin multiple plates without smashing any of them.

[Wccftech: 10/10](https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/)

>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth takes the second chapter of Cloud Strife's struggle to save the planet he calls home and surpasses the highs of Final Fantasy VII Remake in every way.

[GamesRadar+: 4.5/5](https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/)

>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth closely follows what Remake first outlines

[Easy Allies: 9.5/10](https://youtu.be/5SOXVEuRLSQ)

[Attack of the Fanboy: 5/5](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review/)

>Final Fantasy VII Remake evoked all kinds of emotions in me, made me see my low-poly childhood friends as real people, and allowed me to once again be part of a grandiose, fate-challenging, god-defying adventure that I haven't experienced since the PS1 days.

[Gaming Trend: 95/100](https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/14003/Final-Fantasy-VII-Rebirth/)

>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is not only a worthy successor to Remake, but to the original title. With an incredible and multi-layered open-world, outstanding combat, and a heartfelt story that takes you on a beautiful scenic route, Rebirth reaches heights you'd need one wing to touch. Rebirth is special; First-Class in a way only the best Soldiers can be.

[Gaming Nexus: 9.5/10](https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/14003/Final-Fantasy-VII-Rebirth/)

>With the core team assembled, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth feels like embarking on a fantastic adventure with a gang of your best friends. More open, action-packed, and surprisingly funny, Rebirth gives players days of content and the freedom to pursue it, while still telling a wonderful and cohesive story. Every aspect of Remake has been examined, refined, and improved. This is the franchise's Empire Strikes Back, in all the best ways.

[PlayStation Universe: 9.5/10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-ps5-review/)

>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth takes the foundations of Remake and expands on them, adding more control to combat, more places to explore, and more ways to dig deeper into the world and the story it tells. Whether in Graphics or Performance Mode, the quality of the experience remains the same: top tier presentation with exceptional gameplay. Rebirth is an early shoe-in for Game of the Year.

[Eurogamer: 4/5](https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed)

>Rebirth is a playful take on an emo classic that's bloated but full of character in a bid to justify its own existence.


Still sitting at 93 on Metacritic. Highest-rated FF of all time except for FF9. Congratulations SE you magnificent bastards
    They were confident with these early reviews and it shows. Very happy when developers got to make the game they wanted to make. 29th is a long way for me lol
    Id say its higher than ff9 arguably because ff9 only had like 20 something reviews.
    Square, i give you permission to drink your damn. Tea. You earned it.
| Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is so good, it nearly wrecked my life


Oh no
    Solid, no spoils review.
    I wanted to read that review so bad but I'm not paying.
FF7R had 136 reviews, this one has 114 already and a 93. It's gonna keep that score (at worst it will go down to 92).  This is the second highest score of a FF ever (below FF9 with a 94). Above FF6, 7, 8, 10, 12, Shadowbringers, Endwalker...  


  By the way games with 93 in the last 10 years: Persona 5, the Witcher 3, The Last of Us 2 and Hades, Half-life Alyx.  Only GoW, RDR2, BG3, Elden Ring and the 2 Zeldas have a higher score in the last decade.  


 Even with a divisive ending, we have, very likely, an all-time great game and a very likely GOTY.
    I knew Rebirth would be a hit.  Just sounds like it absolutely surpasses Remake.  Can't wait.
        It was guranteed a hit in the jrpg fandom. But with a score like this, i hope it brings in a lot of casual gamers and SE gets those sales numbers
    Ff9 only has like 20 something reviews so not the biggest sample size. So its arguable that rebirth is the highest rated ff game of all time
        yeah but kind of misleading as well- because just like with ff7, 8 and 9 most reviews back then was in gaming magazines, you got 100s of them and they scored very very well in those.
    Damn. Up there with the all-time greats. So happy for SE and CBU1! We have a classic incoming.
Just to counter some of the critics who think the ending is a bit wild, Gene Park says this: 

*"The great anticipation and mystery of “Rebirth” is obvious: How do they tell this story and that particular moment again in 2024? That answer is best left for you to uncover, so all I’ll say is that I now walk away from “Rebirth” with renewed appreciation and confidence in how the original writer, Kazushige Nojima, and his team will finish this new telling."*
    The ending is going to be divisive regardless.  Some like it, some don't and I imagine that'll be the same with the fanbase.
        Yeah agreed. Honestly, part of me likes Square having the cojones, I like it when people take risks, and can appreciate that some people don't. As long as it's not incomprehensible, I'm fairly open-minded about it
            Square is at its finest when it's busy taking risks. Stranger of Paradise is a good example. Incomprehensibly, it's a good game despite boring level design, a story that takes almost the entire runtime of the game to get going and gameplay that feels like diet Nioh, despite some pretty compelling class design.

I love risk-taking Square. They're my favorite.
            A review literally calls it incomprehensible lol
    Gene has a good takes a lot, I trust him
    Based on the leaks and reviews, some of those critics don't seem wrong.
93 Meta is insane. Peak RPG is coming.
    Happy someone else sees this. Cant believe so many are being negative. The last time a FF game got review scores this high half the people in this comments section weren't even alive.
[deleted]
    I didn't read the entire review cause I expected spoilers. However in the VERDICT section at the end, there is a mention about the ending and how SE fumbles with it. That in itself isnt a spoiler just a judgement on the quality of the ending. Its what comes after that which dives deep into spoiler territory by discussing the vibe/type of ending it is as well as other critical elements surrounding this.

Overall its really said that IGN had to do this....
    The GameSpot review says *a lot* about the ending too.
    I watched the IGN video review and I didn't really see or notice anything major?
        One of his final closing lines is VERY leading in relation to certain characters, I honestly think you're better off not watching it again if you didn't catch it. Also there's footage of one of the major bosses.
    I just watched it - It 'could' spoil it.
    It's not a direct spoiler, it's more of a read-between-the-lines spoiler, but yes - it's pretty bad on IGN's part...
    Thank you for the warning, I may have played the OG game but I rather not know what's the same or different at "ALL!"
    I just don’t understand why reviewers are incapable of offering spoiler-free reviews. GameSpot’s unnecessary breakdown of the ending just about ruined my damn week. To describe myself as angry would be an understatement. Why couldn’t they just write “didn’t like the ending, it’ll be controversial, will offer more details in a follow-up article that includes spoilers” and leave it at that? 

I’m going to be grumbling about this for the rest of 2024…
        Don’t worry, that’s not the biggest spoiler imo. 
There’s a big one that’s right in front of your eyes, even in the demo. Not going to say anything more. 
        Sorry to hear. I hope you still buy the game and have a great experience. Unfortunately while details of the ending may have been ruined for you....there is still 50-80 hours of excitement to lead up to that.

As for Gamespot....its par for the course for them. Its almost as if its part of their review methodology to give plot specific in their reviews going all the way back to some spoilers I read in a Mass Effect 2 review.

At least they should be considerate and give a warning before they say what they need to say.
        Yeah its a complete c\*nt move by them. Spoilerful reviews are fine but NOT before the game is even released, it shouldn't even be an option, even if they put a disclaimer in front.
Right now, i’m really happy for the Square Enix team. I had the chance to meet Hamaguchi-san and Kitase-san at the Community Event in Paris back in November, and we could feel the passion they put on this project. It’s very cool to see them rewarded today, i hope the game will sell well !
    Just found this on Twitter, couldn’t be more excited for the team

https://preview.redd.it/1gudidhgx5kc1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6442555d5308624b2b6a579b8d60edc0d29c47dc
    Agreed!! I’m so happy for them, I can only imagine how they’re celebrating right now looking at these reviews
Last time ff game got over 90 metacritic score was 18 years ago !!!  WOW !!!!!!!
    Maybe single player but the last 2 14 expansions are both in the 90s
93/100 is insane. Idk how that doesn’t get people more excited, but I guess some of the reviews spoiled stuff. Anyways, one if the biggest rated JRPG’s of the last 10 years
    Actually the highest (unless you consider Zelda a JRPG) along with Persona 5. 


Actually it's in the top 5 JRPGs ever acording to metacritic (FF9, Chrono Cross, P4, P5 and FF7R)
        Some of these older games have less reviews but yea 93 is bonkers. For reference games like Bloodborne have a 91, God of war Ragnarok has 94, Halo 3 has 94, as does original MW and bioshock. I use those as examples of the company rebirth is in now in terms of review scores. Very cool to see
    I know right. 

I was just looking through metacritic at the scores of some of the most popular RPG's and Rebirth is a full 10 points more than some of them, like Ghost Of Tsushima which had 83, Horizon FW got 88. Etc. 

This is gonna be a slow week.
Here's something crazy - Rebirth has a higher metacritic score than OG FF7 on the Playstation lmao

[https://www.metacritic.com/game/final-fantasy-vii/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation](https://www.metacritic.com/game/final-fantasy-vii/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation)
    yeah but in 97 we had gaming magazines, not internet reviews we went by, and for ex the one in sweden gave it a 97/100. you include the 90s reviews and it wouldnt be close.
        you're not wrong, it was all 10s and high 90s in magazines when it released.(UK) Such was it's impact.
    It has like 6x the reviews too, which is extremely impressive.
This isn’t really a story spoiler, just a minor moment that happens in the game, I hope it’s okay if I mention this because it’s not really story related but if not sorry I’ll delete. Too funny to not want to talk to someone about lol. 

>! I cannot fucking believe there’s a cutscene where Tifa in a bikini literally leans down with her gigantic breasts basically hanging out in Cloud’s face, he stares directly into them and gasps, and then walks away blushing lmfao !<

Edit: it is from famitsu’s review so it should be good
    I think that's the clip Famitsu shared today? I had to take a moment lmao
Hopefully, by these scores, this gives SE incentive to use this formula as a foundation for the next mainline FF.
    It's possible that they'll look at the reception 16 and this game receives, compare, and lean in that direction going forward for the mainline entries.

Need to wait and see.
holding steady at 93 with 94 reviews. could be the close to the consensus
    With 94 reviews, I don't see it changing much.  Maybe 92 at worst.

Still, regardless, an overwhelming success.
Word can’t even begin to describe how hyped I am for this game!
    We have been waiting for this for more than 2 decades!
        What a wait it’s been!
Man, I cannot wait for Thursday. I'll finish work, then go and pick up the game. Get home, order the biggest pizza you've ever seen, and then become unavailable for 3-5 business days.
    Wait, but if you order the pizza ahead of time, you can have it by the time you reach home!  
  
Otherwise, love this plan
        You genius
    I'm gonna be pre-loading the digital delixe edition so as soon a midnight hits, I'll be ready to go, booked time off, so it's gonna be an all nighter with pizza, coffee and beer, haven't had an insane gaming session in so long, cannot fucking wait.
I ain't ever leaving Costa Del Sol.

    ... and here people were thinking Tifa was nerfed by Square Enix.  The sports bra was just working overtime.  


https://i.redd.it/pgqv4sbr28kc1.gif
        Tbh even with the sports bra they look very big.

I think too many chronically online people fail to realize that real women who have breasts like Tifa's are in fact considered very, very well endowed, lol. 

The whole nerf narrative was always silly.

    You mean we get this plus a full fledged game?!

The game hasn't received a score below 8/10.  Touch wood.
    >Touch wood

I definitely am
        Lmao
NINETY-FUCKIN-THREE?!
    That just for there to be 7 leftover I think. It's a nod to squares love of 7s. Should've been 97.
Our review is live. I spent 100 hours with the game (current hour count is at 138) and I made sure not to spoil much. 9.5/10; feel free to ask me anything as long as it's not embargo-breaking. I will try to answer as much as I can.

[https://thenerdstash.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-new-instruments-playing-an-old-familiar-melody/](https://thenerdstash.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-new-instruments-playing-an-old-familiar-melody/)
    Did Cait Sith have better character development than OG?
    How many enemy skills are there? Does each character get their own moments to shine?
    Are you able to upgrade weapons like in Remake, so that for example the buster sword is still a viable weapon to use in the endgame?
        Weapon upgrading is very different. Weapon skill tree's are gone. Instead, each weapon has different strengths and weaknesses, and those kinda stay that way through the whole game. One new aspect though, are weapons level from using them, and each time a weapon "levels", you unlock a new passive skill that character can equip regardless of the weapon in there hand.

I finished the game with Buster Sword in hand.
            Do you get more materia slots though or does the number stay the same for each upgrade?
    Did the game have a lot of bosses with pre-determined teams or do you get to pick your team for most bosses?
    are there huge optional monsters to fight?
        This game has more than its fair share of tough big bosses to hunt down.
    Listing Queen's Blood being too addictive as a Negative got me chuckling (I understand it's meant as a joke and not something you docked points for)
        IT'S SO ADDICTING. Its both a blessing and a curse.
    How long is the main game? If I breezed through.
        I'd say if you breezed through it and ignored everything else, probably 40 hours if I had to guess. It's hard for me to discern because I did a lot of exploration and secret stuff.
    Can I go back to areas from the previous chapters without doing the chapter again to explore missed areas?  

And, is exploration somewhat organic, can I stumble upon caves/areas and find good items encounter bosses etc? Kinda like Elden Ring did?
        There are some chapters where you have access to a bunch of the open world locations and you can freely explore them. It doesn't have the same dynamic stumbling upon things such as Elden Ring, but the open world quests and activities often build toward something larger and more connected, and the rewards are always worth it.
            Ok that's good enough for me. The heavy chapter based replay factor of the first game put me off replaying to find missed collectibles so I was hoping they'd steer from that design.  

Can't wait to get in there next week!  

EDIT: I internally call it the "stumble upon factor" but since I have not used it in public I figured no one knows what I mean, but yeah Elden Ring is S tier Stumble Upon Factor, SUF.
    Was the performance any better in the real game compared to the demo?
        About the same if I had to wager. It was never something where I would complain about it as the scale and some of the later moments are so impressive.
    Did you find the ending and the moments leading up to and after it fitting of the OG? Was it confusing?
    At 138 hours, is that doing everything in the game or attempt to completing everything? Asking as a completionist 
        SOme of that is me trying to do everything, but I'm also documenting it for work, taking videos etc. I could have done just about everything by the 100 hour mark if that was my sole focus. I've been taking in the view a bit ya know, enjoying it.
    Is there any depth to any of the mini games or are they all bare bones?
        There is. Often a mini-game will be part of the story, and then you are fre to replay it and chase for high scores. They also have a multitude of unlocks that are pretty damn good. I'm talking like, actual character weapons and stuff you can't get anywhere else.
    Would you say the demo is a good example of what the open world feels like? Just running around killing monsters between towns? Because if so I am perfectly fine with that!
        Yes, but the full game has more to see and do in each open world, and the demo has none of the larger story beats some of these side activities lead to down the road.
Big win for SE. Highest rated FF game since FFIX 24 years ago.
    Highest rated FF of all time after IX actually. Abive 6,7,8...
first single player FF to have a meta score in the 90s range since forever. congratulations to square
It's been a while, FF. Finally, that coveted 90+. Damn, they cooked.
Famitsu gave it 38/40
    Famitsu gave FF16 and FF7 remake 39/40. 🤔
Ladies and Gentlemen, they did it.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi59FV3SlWA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi59FV3SlWA)

Podcast where they spend time talking about their reviews.   No ending spoilers, don't worry.

FYI, the Gamespot guy that gave the game 8/10, but gave Remake a 10/10 is on the bottom-right of the podcast.

**TLDR :** A couple of them really liked it with 9.5 to 10/10 scores.  Gamespot guy and another guy didn't like the ending, felt it was a bit of a mess, but still gave it 8/10 and 9/10 respectively and still really enjoyed most of it and think there's a lot of potential for the 3rd game.  Another girl was a bit hit or miss but wasn't a big FF7 fan to begin with and had only played Remake, not the OG or other parts of the compilation.

So there seems to be a healthy chunk of people that seem to either not mind or actually like the ending, and another that doesn't.  Same as Remake, essentially.

Yet, with that in mind, it still scored highly with those people.
    Yeah, I really feel the people that liked Remakes ending, will probably like this ending too. The ones that don't like the pull aways from the OG might not.

Edit: This is pure speculation, I have not seen any leaks or know anything outside of official posts by Square.
I read the long Gamespot review...huh. Others also mentioned the divisive ending, but for most it didn't diminish the game's achievement (I think one even liked it). This reviewer liked the game but eviscerated the ending, quite personally I thought. I thought the reviewer was talking through a critical non-fan eye, but apparently he was a huge FFVII fan (he gave FFVII remake 10 / 10).

I think I will take his point about the ending and park it outside the box of "consensus facts about the game" . At least until the game is out and we can see for ourselves.
    I think, like anything FF7 related, it divides opinion, but at least people know that this time going into Rebirth that this isn't a 1:1 remake of the OG and things might be different.  It's not like they are completely blindsided this time like they were with Remake.

The game received about 40 10/10 scores across the review board, which is ridiculous.  You don't give a game those scores if the ending doesn't stick, so whilst there are a lot of reviewers that either didn't like the ending or were pretty meh about it, there's a lot of others that did enjoy it.

We'll just have to wait and see how fans react.
    There is no such thing as neutral reviews. Humans have preferences. That's not just true for the narrative. Some reviewers loved the open world, others hated it. Many praised the sidequests, some hated them.

Your best bet is to watch a reviewer whose preferences align with yours.
The best game ever made will be out within a few hours guys!
    I'm on PST so it'll be out within 15 hours...I'm so excited that I can't sleep man.
        I'm not sure if I will sleep tonight either as the game will be playable at midnight in the UK...
Yeah I know I’m weird, but for some reason this has made me emotional. I’m just so happy for the developers and of course for us fans getting to experience this game.
    No I get it. I hate being a fanboy cheering for a company, but after a year of discourse about XVI and people wanting it to fail and reports of how the franchise is being left in the dust by its competitors, I started to wonder if they were right and this series is just in a downward decline. Not to mention that I myself didn't love XVI when it was all said and done.

So seeing so many people rate it so highly and the passion that the team has for the game just makes me smile. Like all of their hard work is paying off.
    If you want to get emotional, read the WashingtonPost's review.  Holy shit. I'm hyped right now.
    Same here. Odd isn't it.
    Not weird tbh, I think it makes sense.
Careful with IGN video review they spoil some of the ending.
    Damn it I wish I saw this comment first 
93 on metacritic! This is going to be game of the decade for me.
Wanted to highlight another positive take about the ending since I ran into review that had one:

*This entire game takes place during a bit of a narrative lull in the overarching story, but Rebirth is all about the unknown journey and the small character moments peppered throughout, rather than the destination. The game’s finale packs a weighty emotional punch and satisfying conclusion that is sure to be debated in the years leading up to the final chapter. The climax of Rebirth feels earned and hints at the developer’s intentions for the remake project at large. The changes or expansions to the story feel natural, with the additional emphasis on character and world-building deeply enrich the experience.*

[https://rpgamer.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review/](https://rpgamer.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review/)   (5/5)

Happy to hear some felt that way too.
    Gene Park also loved it too, from WaPo.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR5kkl2Z\_GE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR5kkl2Z_GE)

Skill up confirming from 32:35 that he's in the process of reviewing the game.  SE allowed him to use 10 minutes of gameplay footage as part of the early review code guidelines so he's waiting until after the release date and until he's completed the game so that he can fill up his  video with more.

Seems to be absolutely loving it though.
[https://twitter.com/Danfromumbrella/status/1760786857011417364](https://twitter.com/Danfromumbrella/status/1760786857011417364)

Gene Park stating that they loved the ending, as opposed to Gamespot.  He said he was skeptical after the ending of Remake, but understand now why they did what they did.  Also stated that if this came out last year, it would take his vote for GOTY over Baldur's Gate 3.

High praise indeed.

    Scores usually drop over time as more reviews come out across a broader range of media. XVI was over 90 at first too, but ended up in the mid 80s. We'll see how it goes with this, but the overall impression seems to be an improvement on Remake, so hoping it remains over 90.
        Its not going to drop much it already has over 77 reviews.

XVI already dropped below 90 by that point.
        It’s now at 93 with 113 reviews, so it’s basically impossible for it to fall much if at all anymore 
For anyone worried about certain reviewers having an issue with the ending— stop worrying. Did we really expect this game to not be divisive? Just like with Remake’s ending, certain people dislike Square’s new twist on the story, even though it essentially follows the same plot points. Look what Square has given us so far, the highest rated FF game in decades. I have complete faith in them and I fully trust their decisions. I’m sure the ending is great, it might just take some time to resonate and sink in for some folks
    if the ending does not spawn a massive number of youtube videos analyzing and theorizing what comes next like Remake did, I’ll be somewhat disappointed, lol. Had so much fun watching those back in the days.
        Exactly!!!! That’s like my favorite part of this remake trilogy lol I absolutely love Square’s reimagining of this story
            yeah, if they somehow can keep us talking about part 3 until it comes out, I think it’s a success.
    I'd argue that some of those reviewers might not even be that deep down the rabbit hole regarding the new aspects of this version of the story, to make sense of all of it. As you said, sometimes it takes time to properly digest events that happened differently and to try to reason why they changed certain things and where it leads. This limited amount of time will surely not be enough to take it all in, just going by Remake. And something creative choices are just divisive by nature, can't do much about that.
    Divisive endings are often my favorite. Usually means they took a chance on something
i love one the of reviewer quote: "I loved Final Fantasy VII Remake, but Rebirth makes it look like a demo."
    Honestly that was my impression just from watching the trailers. It looks like Rebirth is expanding on so much that the first game really was like a test run.
    It really does make part 1 look like a prologue
Why is JeuxActu score 80/100 on metacritic ?

It's 17/20 on their website https://www.jeuxactu.com/test-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-deja-le-goty-2024-non-n-exagerons-rien-129978.htm

Not that it matters a lot, but it's odd
    Back to 93,0088 Average if it's 85 instead of 80.
    Yeah, that is weird.
    Yeah, it should be 85. I wonder if we can somehow  report it to metacritic...
        17/20=85 i commented on jeuxactu youtube channel but they deleted my comment.
            They replied to someone and they said that their score is 17, but they actually changed it on their website to 16. Wow this is shitty move...
    Really strange.  They gave Helldivers the same score but it's counted as a 85 on metacritic.
    I can't believe they said this game would run perfectly fine on a PS4...
    Wtf
    They've changed it to 16/20 now.
I decided to drop the money for a PS5 just now to play it tomorrow. 

Was going to wait until the PC port but I'm too excited!
My heart is happy.

Thoroughly deserved.
    DARTHH BRO WE DID IT, I tried @ you in gfaqs but didn’t work.

93 on meta with 116 reviews. What a day and what a game. Now time to sort out that AMA 👀
        YESSS!

Sorry I haven't logged on there for a day or two, kinda took a step away and went outside :D 

Don't know if I can do an AMA now as the sub is on lockdown, might just write a comment on the endgame discussion thread or something and people can post under there.
    Thank you for the fun on the deleted thread. 
FIghtinCowboy - 5 out of 5.  

"This is the best Final Fantasy game, outright." 

IMO - This is the review that carries a TON of weight.  He's one of the few reviewers that always calls as it is.
    He can sometimes let his personal preferences hype him up a little more than I'd agree with, for example I'm pretty sure he said XVI was the best FF when it came out, but I generally agree he's a pretty solid reviewer. 

He usually gives a very good overview of what you can expect from a game.
A dream come true
    Being a FF fan was ROUGH over the last 20 years.

But they finally did it, after 20 years of patiently waiting and dreaming of the "PS1 FF games modernized" we finally got it.

They fucking did it.
        Exactly. Not to mention this game covers the parts where I became a true FF fan so if one game had to break it I wanted it to be this one
Omg...it's been decades since I've seen a 90+ non mmo FF. About damn time
I haven’t seen a game I’ve been waiting for get these kind of reviews in a while. Probably at least since Red Dead 2. I’m so fucking excited.

Gonna have to keep my distance from reviews though considering the IGN review apparently spoils some stuff. Gotta go in clean as can be!
    Seems clear why Square lifted the embargo so early now
Just like I said! I said that it will have a mustplay in metacritic 92-94
I just want to point out that while 2024 might not live up to the colossus that 2023 was in terms of amazing games it’s wildly impressive that Rebirth scored a 93. It’s arguably harder to score well following the release of so many recent amazing and well reviewed games as the bar of short term expectations has been raised by those recent releases. IMO if this game as it is now released in 2022 it probably could’ve scored a couple points higher. Even if the ending is wonky the overall experience promises to be amazing
    Well, a 93 would have put it on par with the likes of RE4, and behind BG3 and TOTK.

I think it would have been nominated at the expense of one of Alan Wake 2, Spiderman 2 or Super Mario Wonder and not looked out of place.
This was always my favourite part of the original, that first step out onto the world map in absolute wonderment and though the task was a perilous one, in the early stages it felt so fun and light hearted. The music on the way to North Corel on the railway tracks truly opitomised that. 


It truly gave a grand sense of adventure that I've never felt since quite the same. The reviews look as if they've knocked it out of the park and if so, this could have the potential to knock the OG off of top spot for me. 


The remake was exceptional but covered most people's least exciting part of the OG, rebirth could be generational and the hype is something I didn't know I still had as a 35 year old.
    The world feels absolutely massive. You won’t be dissapointed
    I always loved the original Midgar section, but I also totally feel what you’re saying about that first realization that the game is only just beginning on the other side of its walls. 

Story-wise, Remake improved on a few iconic moments of the original (opening bombing mission, walking across the rooftops with Aerith, Turks being challenging adversaries) and added a bit of narrative depth to other areas (the magnitude of Hojo and Shinra’s evil, Barret and Marlene’s relationship). But it also padded/dragged a few chapters out past being enjoyable (sun lamp maze, train graveyard, climb to the plate, and even some of the Hojo floor). And Chapter 18, while undeniably epic in the combat department, was a weird mess with a clearly tacked-on final boss. 

All of which is to say, I don’t know exactly what to expect in Rebirth, but if it can have the good sense of not stretching the less crucial narrative moments too thin, I’m certain it will be an excellent game. Regardless, the sense of more freedom and what looks like an improved combat system will carry the day.
    Idk about others, but the original Midgar section is absolutely my favorite part of the game, the other cities are cool, but Midgar feels truly “alive”, and there’s so much happening in terms of world building, characterization and emotional/funny moments in such a short amount of time.

The other areas are just don’t feel as fleshed out as Midgar, there’s about 5hrs of story/gameplay dedicated to this introduction to the world of FF7.

It also helps that i’m a huge Blade Runner fan, and Midgar has that cyberpunk narrative/aesthetic.
[Gene Park](https://twitter.com/GenePark/status/1760675435602661563): Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the best Square Enix game since Final Fantasy X. this is a dream game. It's so good, it nearly wrecked my life
    That review was awesome.
    I’m salivating
WARNING: IGN lightly spoils the ending in its verdict paragraph.
    thanks for letting us know, we will pin this as a comment so everyone sees it.
        Good work! Thx
    Yeah I just watched their review and definitely wish I hadn’t. It was a little too spoilery for my taste.
Best final fantasy in a fucking decade, I called it!
Damn after all these years getting hyped thinking the next FF will review 90+, saw the complaints about the graphical quality of the demo and thought "meh this probably won't be the one, I'm not gonna rush to metacritic to find out". 93. FF fans eatin today
    FFXIV did pretty good, for what it's worth expansion-wise. But it's nice to see Rebirth kick ass.
Nojima has been asking on Twitter what the hell "GOAT" means, lmao
    Watch as he misunderstands and gives us a goat farming mechanic in FF3R instead.
    Nojima-san is a fkn treasure man!
The comments on the Washington Post article are ridiculous. Really? We're still shaming adult male gamers because it's a "children's hobby"? WTF?! I thought we were past that shit.

Good review any ways.
    there were like 3 comments like that, usually with people calling them out on their BS

one of the people criticizing the author of the review was literally just named “Donald J Trump” so im pretty sure he’s a troll
Read some reviews again, I was particularly struck by this one from Kotaku, to quote (elipsis is where I cut some content for brevity) :

"
Rebirth brought me back to my unique recollection of how the world looked and sounded in my mind...I’ve come away from my playthrough realizing that the fates of certain characters... aren’t make-or-break moments for Rebirth. All of this already happened in 1997....

I found Final Fantasy VII Rebirth to be a very special game full of contemplative and entertaining moments...Rebirth was an invitation to rethink and reconsider a game I’ve loved dearly for decades...Rebirth’s narrative decisions surprised me for sure, but they didn’t repel me. Instead, they set me adrift in this magical liminal space that I’m still savoring—and trying to make sense of. 

Rebirth is sure to be a more divisive and debated game than Remake was. But in this deep sea of an RPG, I was thrilled by the action and the- tactics, brought to emotional highs and lows through its characters, and found myself with an even greater love of FF7, the original and this return, than I thought was possible
"

[Kotaku FFVII Rebirth Review](https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129)

The verge calls it "A modern open world RPG with the soul of 1997"

 High praise indeed
I messaged metacritic about the JeuxActu review score not matching the one on their site and they said they sent it over to the team.
    The author of that review actually memed about regretting putting such a "high grade" initially, he felt too generous and should have put 15 from the start. Look I get not liking the game, but that just fucking malicious at this point.
    It’s also missing a 5/5 review from the Daily Star
Great to see it getting a positive reception. I'm not reading too deep into the reviews since I'd rather experience things for myself, but it's pretty much what I expected - positive on the story, combat is a decent step up, the character moments are still a highlight. 

The move to open world seems the most divisive, with some finding it a bit too stuffed with generic side content and less interesting filler, though that seems mostly down to how much an individual enjoys that sort of side content.
    The game touts that 100+ hours of content, theres really no game out that has 100% non-filler side content with that kind of length (Not even Witcher 3 is perfect theres very repetitive side quest design even if it is the usual benchmark for Open World), and they went the extra mile to pack a ton of mini-games ontop. Its an achievement regardless.
        True enough. I'm just hoping that a good percentage of that side content is quests with some engaging side stories and character moments. I could do without the open world waymark hunting sort of thing, but if that's in addition on top of the more interesting stuff then it's ok (and optional), and if the world is good enough then more reason to explore it is a positive.
My hype is at insane levels right now
Feeling good about this. I think this will shape up to be a jrpg fans dream.
I can't wait to get it!
I knew from the moment I seen the TGS footage in September last year that this would be an absolute banger so pre-ordered a game for the first time.

Good to see my faith in the CBU1 team vindicated! Can't wait for the release next week.
IGN spoils the ending but it's just as >!ambiguously stated!< as it has been said by Square. >!They say that it's different though.!<
They also said it took >!82!< hours to complete the story.
    82 HOURS for story alone? Surely they were dabbling in every side quest/mini game they could. 

Just did a quick peek and Part 1 was an average of 42 hours with main story & 'extras'. Is IGN claiming this game is twice as long as Part 1?
        Not for story alone. IGN has another article detailing the game time of 5 different employees. The fastest went through at 33 hours focusing on just the main story. The longest employee took over 97 hours.
        FightinCowboy (a popular Let's Play Youtuber) said you could probably get through it in about 40 hours if you done nothing but the main story progression.

I can see this having quite a diverse playtime from 50-120 hours as very few people will hightail the main story and do nothing else.
        Didn't watch the IGN review, but all the other reviews put the main story at 35-45 hours if you ignore all side content. Close to 100 hours if you do all side content.
    Yeeeeeah, I literally just hit the pause on the review. They didn't say it DIRECTLY, but the "the ending gives a message about >!grieving!< said it all. >!Not saying that I'm surprised. I was in the camp of wanting to see things play out differently for Aerith - moreso the HOW it happens, and not it not happening.!<
God this game sound big, as the noisypixel reviewer put over 160 hours into the game for the review.

[https://noisypixel.net/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review/](https://noisypixel.net/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review/)
    I’m playing the game early. I’m 16 hours in and I’m still a few hours away from finishing up all the Junon stuff
The hype is real: 

https://youtu.be/oQGdy2yAK4U?feature=shared
PSA: do not Google anything related to Rebirth, as the search bar suggestions might give you ending spoilers 😳
    The Polygon article? What are they playing at 😐
Oh gosh the GameSpot review is so blunt…Do not read that review until u wanna be spoiled cos if u interpret their paragraph on the ending it’s quite clear what happens at the ending
    I want to “thank” the GameSpot reviewer for spoiling Rebirth for me. 

And by “thank”, I mean punch that bastard in the mouth.
    I did myself a favor long ago and stopped consuming their content.  Life's been great ever since.
    does it have to do with you-know-who or is it other stuff?? i want to read it if its about her and her only

EDIT: watched the end of the gamespot review, if anyone wants to know, DM me
Reminder that Part 1 was an 87 on metacritic with how amazing that was. Now Rebirth is at a 93, we might have the game of the generation incoming.
    Part 3 better be a 100/100 game with this progression
Square Enix are back.  Hamaguchi, Nomura and Kitase you legends.
    Don't forget Nojima.
        Nojima you legend.
            Endo (battle director) also a legend
                The biggest legend from my perspective, this battle system is straight fire. 

One of the best in gaming, for my money.
                He's the real MVP!
    As a fanbase we're so unbelievably lucky to still have this group at SE and still working while continuing to honor the source material with the reverence it deserves.  It's pretty remarkable.  What a time to be alive for FF fans.
    Uematsu!  The music in these games are a fantastic reimagining and extension of his music
        Add Hamauzu and Suzuki too, their takes on Nobuo's work and their original compositions are a crucial part of this whole project!
            Yeah, even through Square Enix's struggles, there have been incredibly talented composers all over the company.  The soundtracks never disappoint.
They fucking cooked

Is this the best rated FFVII in 15 years?
    All things considered it’s the best rated FF game ever.

FFIX may technically have a higher rating but it only has 22 reviews. 

Rebirth has way more perfect scores/reviews and managed to maintain an equal rating.
Video games saved n peaked again, Im so ready 🫡
Silver age of Square Enix!

Nier Automata + Replicant, Dragon Quest 11, Trial of Mana, FF7 Remake, Stranger of Paradise, Neo The World Ends with You, Dragon Quest Builder 2, Bravely Default 2, Live a Live remake, Octopath Traveller 2, Star Ocean 6 + Star Ocean Second Story R, FF14 Shadow Bringer + End Walker, FF16, FF7 Rebirth

Titles in cooking: (FF7 part3 + FF9 remake + FFT remaster, FF14 Dawn Trail? Kingdom Hearts 4? Verum Rex/ FFvs13? Vision of Mana? Dragon Quest 12 + DQ3 remake?)
Hot damn.  I'm not reading the comments here or really anything else moving forward, but it sounds like it succeeds on a technical and gameplay level...and I actually did have a couple of worries there.  Now we just wait to see how the storyline shakes out.
Well Square and Amazon have failed to deliver on release day....
    Whereas Amazon in the UK delivered my copy a day early.
I thought I had unrealistic expectations but jesus the scores are somehow higher than I thought. 1 more week reeeeeeeee
Gene Park from the Washington post called it the best FF game since X.
No one in here better act like they expected a fucking 93 on metacritic lol.
    A lot of ppl did. I personally expected anywhere from 90-94 especially when intergrade got 89 and just based off the demo, rebirth plays so much better imo
    I was expecting low 90s as many other people were. There was a post about it several days ago, the lowest estimated score I saw was like 80
It feels surreal. I can’t believe they’ve done it. 

There was a time, for a while, that I thought Square Enix would never be back.

We are SO back!
OMFG LETS FREAKIN GO
Give me all the bloat. I wanna stay in that world for as long as possible!
Some reviews I read criticize that the game is not bold enough to change the story, but at the same time they criticize the ending…
    Because that’s the part with the most change is my guess.
    It sounds like they tried to have it both ways with the ending from what I can infer
    different strokes for different folks
    Can you point out exactly which review said that, I’d like to read myself? Thank you!
Next Thursday needs to hurry up and get here. I can't handle all this hype.
    don't wish the time away, enjoy the simmer of anticipation and take your time savoring when it's finally here.  


im replaying FF7 Remake and getting around to doing the Intermission dlc, so i'm pretty excited about that.
Seems like we've got another 3 MC reviews and 2 OC since yesterday.

All MC scores were 90/100.  Both still holding at 92 and 93 respectively, but probably unlikely to go up.
"Playful take on an emo classic." ??? Like Weezer's Pinkerton or the self titled album by post-hardcore emo punk band Rites of Spring? 

Can we make an official emo playlist for Vincent please?
Holy smokes, the Easy Allies review has me so pumped!
    Oh yeah, in Damiana I trust, when it comes to RPGs and he loves it.
    And they put a good 20 seconds on the Cosmo Canyon theme in there.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQGdy2yAK4U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQGdy2yAK4U)

Easy Allies doing a spoiler-free discussion on their reviews.

Huber seems to absolutely love it.  From his E3 reaction to the Remake announcement in 2015 to now, this game must have been exactly what he'd envisaged the game being back then.
    Can't wait for their spoiler discussion with Max where he's able to predict the title for the third game four years in advance.
Skill-Up on his latest podcast says he's discovering the Grasslands parts of the game (so Chapter 2) and he says he's loving it so far.  So he must have only just started his playthrough.

Characters, moments of levity, meeting interesting NPC's.  So far, he says it's everything he wants a FF game to be.
[deleted]
Just a heads up that the gamespot review says an awful lot about the end, and they were rather harsh in their review of it.  I can't post it here because I think it is too spoilery, but just FYI, it's out there.
    I wish I saw this comment earlier, I just read the Gamespot review and they make it so damn obvious what happens in the end, literally on the verge of spelling it out. They really need to edit their review.
Final Fantasy is back up in the guts of the 90+ aggregate score, ladies and gents! Congrats to the devs for all their hard work and I can't wait until next week!
I truly believe that people having those issues with the mandatory levels of Fort Condor (if you can call them mandatory) are just suffering from poor video game educational experience or too much TikTok hours frying their heads. Games used to be like this. You had to think and repeat, specially in FF mini games. There are also nice rewards for the majority of mini games.

That’s FF and we love it.

You can go play fucking Call Of Duty and leave this game alone.
Has Polygon always had such shit takes? "Square Enix should reconsider how necessary it is for these games to be so big." I mean who TF complains about giving consumers more game for their buck.  

Seems like the opinion of someone trying to hurry up and crank out a review just so they can get to end of job and be paid.
    I mean, to be fair, some games can be too big for their own good.

However I highly doubt this will be one of those games.

And yes, Polygon always has shit takes. They suck. I don't give them clicks any more.
    Bigger is not always better. A lot of padding and busywork can feel like a slog or break pacing. Not saying that's the case here (obviously I haven't played the game nor have I read this specific review to know the context), just a general comment. Some prefer a smaller, more focused experience.
    That’s exactly what it is. Saw one that said the sheer amount of “enjoyable” (yes they called it enjoyable”) side content was a negative because it kept distracting from the main narrative. He legitimately complained that the side content was so engaging that he couldn’t stop it to continue the main story lol
        That's the best negative I've ever heard, sign me up.

Man I'm so hyped for this.
        This legitimately made me laugh when I read it.  I can't believe someone's that stupid to put a statement like that on the record.
            In fairness he gave the game an extremely high score but that was the issue he seemed to hammer on the most lol like the stuff is optional so he didn’t have to waste hours upon hours doing it
        Some of these complaints are ridiculous.

Imagine saying that the side-content is so good that you get distracted from the main narrative and perceiving that a negative.  Just don't do the side-content then.
    Polygon and Kotaku are two of the worst gaming outlets in history. Stay far away
    >Has Polygon always had such shit takes?

Always.
I mean it matters little to me, I’ll love it anyway based on the demo*, but those are some stonking scores.

Enjoyed Nibelheim flashback but nothing bowled me over, whereas playing the Junon segment last night made me so happy I almost had a mental breakdown. Trying out Red, new combat mechanics, the music, exploring. Just an unreal experience.
Seems like it's gonna stay above 90, which hopefully gives the game a nice sales boost.
IGN said the main story took 80 hours, dear god
    That's just what one reviewer did, they have an article where they each mention their finish times and the one who rushed through as fast as possible finished in 33.
    FightinCowboy said he thinks mainstory without any side content is more like 40ish give or take
    16 hours in and I definitely believe it
Part 3 better get a 96 or 98. End it with a BANG!
To anyone wondering who would say "You're captivated by my bodacious beach bod"

\* drum roll \*

It's >!Yuffie      woooooo     !<!
IT'S OUT!!!
Back to 93 again on MC.
It's pretty funny to see loads just latch on to negative bits when the game is getting incredible scores.
GOTY and it's only February.
I’ll be curious how I feel when I beat the game itself and experience the ending, but if it’s as much of a mindbreak as Remake’s I think I’ll enjoy it. I loved being confused by the ending of Remake, thinking about it and coming up with/listening to theories from people like Max Dood.
Tim Gettys from Kinda Funny, a huge FF7 fan, said he flat out disagrees with what they did with the ending so yeah I'm super hyped lmao (he still gave it a 5/5).
    I don’t understand that perspective whatsoever. Square would have never received adequate funding to develop a literal 1:1 remake, nevermind the fact that it would be boring. The remake trilogy is by far the smartest and most creative way to handle this, it’s a remake *with* a reimagining. If someone is that upset over Square’s decision then just stick with the OG. People will find a way to complain about anything.
to the brainlets that feel the need to be negative in any type of way regarding the review scores : this is by far the highest rated FF game (outside of 14) IN LITERALLY TWO DECADES. This should be a day we rejoice and accept that SE has managed to make a new classic. I LOVED Remake but understood its flaws and felt the scores were fair. It has a 93 with 111 reviews currently. THAT IS INSANE. Even the most optimistic FF diehards were assuming HIGH 80s best case scenario. This is a great day to be a FF fan and I am honestly disappointed that so many are being negative. We are getting an 80 hour plus game that is overall amazing with what we all knew was going to be a divisive ending. THIS IS A GREAT DAY TO BE A FF FAN.
    Honestly, you could give some of these people a bag of gold and they would complain that its too heavy.

Some people can never be satisfied by anything.
        When the first demo was released, were people happy and satisfied? Nope, everyone either 1) was immediately disappointed they still had to wait for release; or 2) complaining about the graphics

I mean, whatever criticism you have is fair, but it seemed like NOBODY was content after playing it for one reason or another
        It is just sad, man. Seriously. I am blown away they finally, after all these years of let downs have managed to revitalize the FF brand. 16, albeit not perfect, was a step in the right direction and it seems Rebirth is solidifying SE mission to bring glory back to Final Fantasy. Do these people not remember 15? Do they not remember the disaster that was 13? I am elated right now.
FF7 really about to win Game of the Year 🥲

Love how so many people on this sub saying game was UNPLAYABLE in performance mode. Didn't prevent most reviewers from rating it high
    FFXVI's poor performance mode didn't affect it's final scores so I knew this wouldn't either.
    Because at the end of the day, most reviewers and 99% of the general audience won't care about how it looks. We've seen this time and time again with games over the past few years.

Now this isn't to say people shouldn't be vocal about these issues. They absolutely should if it's important to them.
    Normal people don’t care. Especially when the graphics mode looks so good and runs a consistent 30.
    Most people don't care that's true, i only have an old 1080p tv so it probably won't bother me at all, been playing games sinnce the early 90s so things like resolution don't figure in. BUT...i've just read the PushSquare review and they definitely dock a point because of the issues. Shame
Seems like the game is really good overall with slight hiccups like graphics being one of the only minor flaws. Story being changed slightly will always upset a few people...but I'm not one of them. If I wanted the original story, I'd just go play the OG. Looking forward to the 29th!!!
I think Hamaguchi will get a raise. Second highest metacritic in FF history. Thats a impressive achievement
I was trying to avoid reading reviews, but I caved due to the hype. Seeing some of these glowing reviews is legit making me tear up from happiness and excitement.
Im reading the reviews on metacritic and omg for those who don't want spoilers for the ending, DONT REVIEW OTHER THAN THE FIRST PAGE!!! Its really sad how some reviewers manage to spoil it
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqK2CoI46p8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqK2CoI46p8)

A nice little IGN podcast with a group of guys that really liked Rebirth.

Don't get me wrong, I like seeing both sides of the debate and the arguments made for and against the game but for some reason, I've been seeing a lot of reviewers on podcasts over the last couple of days just hone in largely on the negatives with Rebirth, and I need to regularly check the review score to make sure the game actually scored 93 on OC (92 on MC) because you'd think it scored 60-70 with the way it was getting bashed by some.
    A lot of videos I watch are like 90% negative and then say "yeah game is 4.5/5" lol 
        Yeah, it's weird.

It feels like they're either over-scoring the game based on the criticism they're dishing out, or they're holding the VII series and reputation to such a ridiculously high standard that anything but perfect scores will result in a fair bit of criticism.
            Eh, I don't think that's totally the case. It's just more that those blemishes exist, but don't make the product a lesser product as a result. ACG made that clear in his review, most of the major issues he felt were on the technical end. Side content has been getting a lot of praise, story is as well with the only major blemish being some of the pacing, and the ending being divisive (with even some loving it like Gene Park,) and the world itself is getting tons of love. 

I wouldn't think too hard about it. Blemishes exist in every product, even some of the highest rated ever. Whether or not they hurt the product as a whole is another topic, and going off these reviews, it doesn't seem like they do.
    Welcome to modern YouTube/Podcast sensationalism. They will go wherever they "think" their audience wants to hear which is the controversial stuff based off of the precedent set by Remake.
Metacritic is currently missing the 5/5 from the Daily Star.

NightSkyPrince's review, incredibly positive overall. Only issues he highlighted (without going into story spoilers) was that some of the late game dungeons make Hojo's Lab look like a cakewalk and that the story *can* take a fumble on some occasions, but still praises the story and its characters overall. Huge amounts of praise.
    Important to note that NSP was very critical of Remake, so for him to be praising this game this much means more than usual. 

But honestly, there is not a single aspect of Remake (combat, character arcs, interactions with the characters, worldbuilding, bosses, sidequests, minigames, story, dialogue, VA, art, dungeon design...) that is better than Rebirth. If you didn't enjoy Remake as much, very big possibility you will fall in love with Rebirth, and if you loved Remake, this will be a very unique gaming experience. Enjoy all.
    That's definitely a 10/10 review. The story criticisms are pretty much the same as from other reviews and the same as in Remake. He says game does it best when it tries to faithfully remake the OG FF7, but sometimes fumbles stuff with the new additions, but overall still a very good story.
    Yeah, if I remember, he was another one that really didn't like the direction Remake went and was a bit tepid on the game as a whole.

I imagine he'll still have some issues with the narrative as he alluded to it, but the fact that the game is scoring big DESPITE these issues is testament to it's overall quality.
    > Only issues he highlighted (without going into story spoilers) was that some of the late game dungeons make Hojo's Lab look like a cakewalk

The only issue here is whether this sounds awesome or *very* awesome.
6/10 

*" Too many colored races, too deliberate, affecting the experience，it ruins the atmosphere of the game"*

This is why I haven't taken user reviews seriously for a while now.
    There is a talking lab rat dog and Barrett and yuffie, why wouldn’t there be diversity in this game? it’s established from og 7
        Yeah, it's ridiculous.

It's a fictional fantasy world, they can populate it with whatever the fuck they want.
    I always took metacritic user reviews with a grain of salt but now its just totally compromised by trolls. 
    Dude, srsly wtf?
Woooooo!
There seems to be some complains about it having too many minigames, or side-content being a little repetitive, but overall it seems wonderful!  


You're so lucky you get to play in a week... Have fun!!
    Part of my problem with this criticism is that the OG game had tons of mini games. That's just sort of what I was expecting
    I want 100+ minigames
    >too many minigames

take their keyboards away. shame.
I guessed 90 and it is being mostly surpassed.

Highest scoring FF since 12 I think, clear suggestion is that this is the first one at the classic level since then.

I am very happy BUT I am hoping this isn’t a one off and they can apply their learning to a brand new FF story and world in the future.

But very encouraging.

I have seen the dreaded ‘story might rub some people up the wrong way’ though, which leads me to believe something is going to piss off everyone.
    whatever happens at the end is bound to piss off roughly half the fanbase either way
Mods, if this is the only place here to discus the reviews in a non-spoiler fashion....are we ever going to lock this thread and make a part 2? Therefore we dont yavr to scroll through thousands of replies?
    it's possible, but unlikely we'll create a second thread for reviews. usually discussion of the reviews dies out when the game is released. at that point there is the chapter by chapter discussion threads where things can be discussed until the sub is back open to normal pre-release activity.
        Thanks for locking the sub down BTW! I was getting nervous about spoilers with copies out in the wild now. I think you guys are taking the right approach with the chapter discussion threads.
            You’re welcome. Thanks for the positive feedback. Many have disagreed, but we feel it’s the right thing to do.
Is it still possible to reach 94 on Metacritic?
    Very unlikely.  Usually scores go down over time, not up.

If anything, it's more likely to go down to 92 than up to 94, but with 120 odd reviews, it may hold at 93.
        It's a 92 already
            Yes added new 4 reviews and score decreased to 92.
Eurogamer Germany gave it 80. Also JeuxActu 80, gamersky 95 , Merlin 94

It can be back to 93 if it gets 100 for 3 more reviews or 95 for 4 more reviews
Seems like metacritic is deleting a lot of troll user reviews, it's 8.8 again, up from 8.0.
https://preview.redd.it/r9mrmq12famc1.jpeg?width=1141&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd30ff79513e65cd1af988cab4f24677458bdf53

This kind of sub-beings should never touch a game like this anymore (in case he has a PS5, which I doubt)

“We need more soulslike”

We need you to educate yourself.

Like, for real, learn to rate a fucking game for what it is. It’s a fucking hybrid system from day one. Neither a turn based or soulslike game.

Like asking for basketball players in a football game, people is getting retarded these days.
As an OG player and fan of FF7 , I enjoyed Rebirth and it deserves this Meta score , the ending isn’t that bad as ppl say
Mods, please sweep through these comments. People are being too liberal with discussing spoilers without spoiler tags in a NO SPOILER labeled thread.
    we're working on it. if you see something, please report it.
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 The Final Fantasy Golden Age is back people
I'll give a small review myself:

Gameplay is quite fun, most of the minigames are indeed fun to play although it will depend on people's tastes, exploration is worthy it and actually pays off most of the time, combat can take a bit to get used to but nothing really too complicated to keep up with, awesome soundtrack. For the story, of course with no spoilers, mostly fine with both old and new things added, although it comes with some confusing monents that will likely be better explained in the final part. Just REMEMBER: do not expect everything to be like the original, this isn't the same story as the original, it's a story separated from it and seems to be a sequel/what if. The OG stays where it is and this new trilogy stays where it is.
[FF Union's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJMbUsvMBMc) basically concludes - if you weren't a fan of Remake's story changes, Rebirth won't be for you as it basically doubles down on it. If you were up for/intrigued by the changes, Rebirth is a great ride.

And the ending will only add to the mystery, and theory crafters are going to go nuts.
    Max Dood about to ascend to galaxy mind in the coming months. I can't wait to finish the game lol.
    I am glad. One fear I had is because of Remake's ending being divisive, they would backtrack a little. If this is their vision, I want them to go full on that no matter whst. Once part 3 is released we can all discuss whether the vision worked or not, but I will always appreciate their courage and creativity. 
I'm kinda down for an ending that makes me go "WTF" on first viewing, and then when you sit back and unpick, it ages well (like Remake).

I've always said a completely 1-to-1 showing will always be great on first viewing and then the novelty will wear off over time and eventually feel a little redundant. As long as it doesn't completely shit on the original (which Remake didn't) - I'm down for some crazy shit.
    If they actually do change the ending, I'm more interested in how that may affect what will follow, and if it might just be a delayed outcome that is forced to happen eventually anyway, building a lot of dread in the meantime. If Remake told me one thing, it's not to overreact about the things they might change. Have faith in the devs, they said the core of the game won't change, we'll have to wait for it all to conclude to judge it properly.
Okay sorry for the spoilers folks but as someone who needs this to be faithful to the original - I can’t believe they changed it so that Barrett has actually had his hand the whole time and he just wears that gun around like a big weird glove! What was Square thinking???? 😤

*and apparently there’s also a timeline where Barrett is just a huge talking gun with one human arm???? what the fuck???????
    And Red XIII was just a dude in a fur suit the whole time. Really blew my mind.
        truly unbelievable what they’ve done to this game!!!
    Whoever reported this for “spoilers”… come on…
eurogamer always sucks- and im from europe.
    [removed]
    It's a garbage website, it's Europe's Kotaku. l doesn't help that their video reviews sometimes differ from the written ones.

    lmao hot new meme just dropped
Holy shit this game might legit get GOTY
Well I saw the spoiler comment below, and I think based on that, I can ascertain all the way to what the ending of part 3 will be and what the entire theme of the series or at least that game will be lmao.

It’s actually kind of reassuring tbh as someone who is extremely worried about hearing that the ending is supposedly “incomprehensible”, it will actually resolve in a satisfying and faithful way in the next game
    [deleted]
        I actually am fairly purist about this in the sense that I expect it to be basically 90% faithful. Which it might be? I honestly can’t tell. 

Uh idk if this borders on spoilers because it’s kind of just my theory but just in case >! If my theory is correct, it will end up being faithful but over a longer story arc to the overall original themes. !<
            GamesRadar confirmed it was basically like Remake in their review.  90% faithful to the OG with some deviations.
            I've seen a bunch of reviews say that it's very faithful up until the very end.  It's just the final couple chapters that diverge, same as Remake.

Also your theory is very likely to be true based on developer comments.
        I've seen people say they're ruining what the OG game was, but I think if anyone knows the intent/spirit of OG it's the people who actually made the game in the first place lol
    I’m positive the ending of this is left open-ended so that they don’t cut off half of the fanbase with whatever direction they go in 🤷🏻‍♀️ if you go with option A, people wanted option B will dip, and vice versa
I’m curious.

When was the last time a FF game had a MC score of over 90?

Loving that so many are loving it, and I hope this sends a clear message to SE and this team: MAKE FF GAMES RPGS! Fully explorable worlds, lots of spells, lots of summons, and characters that all play different and are fun.
    I think Ff12 for the last mainline non mmo to score over 90.
    FFXII I think.
Emo classic?
    "emotional"
        *flips hair*
I think it'll probably stick at 92 now, which is what I sort of expected pre-reviews (92 or 93).  If that one 80/100 was enough to drag it down from 93 to 92 then it's probably sitting at a very high 92.9% or something right now, which means it's now unlikely that it'll budge from that with over 123 reviews in.

The lowest score right now is an 8/10, and no mixed or negative reviews which is crazy to me for a FF game.
    I'm with you, reviews are still on the way (till the game releases and even after that) so there are  chances that it can rise up to a 93 again.
Well it is somehow desillusional (in a good way) that a main FF Title is back at a 90+ Score... in the golden Era of Square (90s early 2000s) FF6-FF12 (excluding 11 and sequels) were all 90+ scored games. Which is pretty crazy for a gaming series, having so many titles at such a very high score. It's nice to see that this series might can go back at the quality it once had.
where are ya'll finding these early copies ;-;
Glad to see reviews are so positive. But my god, does it make the wait even harder to bare. lol
Metacritic score seems to have dropped to 92. I don't keep track of these things so I wonder if it's typically anticipated to drop even more up to and beyond the game's release or if this score usually stays consistent after the 1st 100 hundred critic reviews or so.
    Score stays consistent, already 120+ reviews so probably stays 92, min 91
    It's currently sitting at 92.96% so it's very unlikely to go down to 91 with 120+ reviews in.

FightingCowboy discusses his review of the game.

Says it's a game of the year contender, and the few things he didn't like too much (a couple of mako vacuum-like areas of the game where you do menial tasks, the transition from light to dark areas, and some of the collision detection) were minor nit picks but he really enjoyed doing a lot of the side quests, mini-games, says the map is large, and combat system blows Remakes out of the water as you start to progress through the game.

He's about 75 hours in but suspects he'll take between 90 and 100 to get everything done.
As expected. I hope it comes to PC by end of this year(insert big copium)
Let's go 93% 
GOTY hopefully
Only negatives I see are ending/story related
    all i am picking up is "if you hated how they ended remake, you wont change your opinion here".  

Reminds me of watching a C-Drama (since the lady has been going hard on that shit as of late) and they just end the episode on a random sentence.  Yeah, it aint the best, but the rest of the show was good so idgaf.
    Somehow, I see this as a good thing 
Wow!!! I am shocked at how high the review aggregate is and am very glad that Square delivered on all that was promised. I had a great time exploring Junon last night so I had a feeling the open world would be fun and exciting and not boring like most open worlds.
Mild spoilers in chat by the way, I know people are just repeating what they have read, but thread is tagged no spoilers so shouldn’t be seeing them.

For example you can fairly confidently guess the ending from what is being said here.
These are even better than I expected. I’ve already notified everyone not to bother me between Feb 29th-March 4th.
Physical deluxe already preordered
Where is Skill Up’s review btw
I told people the trailer was amazing and never been this hyped since p5 or witcher 3.  Seems like I ended up being right, however, the demo didnt amaze me - I have to be honest, but that was a demo.  I think the other areas and all the mini games are gonna deliver. that card game especially I look forward to, loved that in ff8 and witcher 3.
To anyone who has played the game already I have a question. 

I plan to replay the flashback section of the Demo the night before I receive the main game - there is an obvious section of the flashback missing from the demo (the Mako reactor scenes up to the cut back to Kalm). 

Is it at this point where your save that carried over from the Demo picks up or does it skip to the start of chapter 2? 

Just don’t want to miss out on anything on my first main playthrough. 

Many thanks in advance
    U cunt with that avatar lol. I fooled for it
    So if you’ve played the demo you still have to play that section of the game up until you begin the trek up the mountain. That means you have to play the beginning section of Sephiroth fighting the monsters and Cloud exploring the village. Once you get to the mountain path the game offers to let you skip ahead to the village burning.

No spoilers but there is actually a fairly quick but major playable portion that takes place before the demo
I'm actually curious what's the starting level?
    I read from the game devs that it starts a bit higher than Remake, and the level cap is also higher (70 I think), but can't tell the level numbers for sure.
        Iirc, the starting level is around 20.
I don't automatically dismiss negative reviews as review bombing, but some recent negative user reviews I've seen in metacritic so obviously has got an axe to grind, that I start to wonder about the veracity of the other negative reviews. Either way, I hope they can at least resell the copy to refund their money.

    It's full of absolutely clownish negative reviews.
    Look at these clowns.

I’m loving this game, I’m at junon, taking my time with each mini game, taking on every battle, loving it.  The ff7 I dreamed of as a kid.
Whoever designed the jungle zone should be shot and quartered.  I love running around looking for a single passage to a single mushroom to get to where I need to go.

The side quests are fucking dull and boring for the most part.  Catch chicken? I'm having a good time until the jungle zone

I'm halfway through the game and there's no all material? I don't have enough material to fill my spares.  I know there's magnify but it's not the same.  

I just love switching my materia because my party changes every fucking 1 hour.  Got to spend 10 minutes rearranging everything just because the fucking storyline says so.
These reviews made me more hype … and I managed to find a copy in London today, cannot wait to get home!

    Can you already play before 29th ?!
        I’m pretty sure you can with the disc version, there has never been a case where it was “locked” before release, at least from my experience!
            Which store? I live in London too!
    Where did you get it?
Wow, looking like this is going to be the best final fantasy game since the OG FF 7 released almost 30 years ago.
Nice to have overwhelming positive Reviews!
This is very promising.
Hopefully they'll work in optimizing Performance Mode better and adding 40 FPS Mode in 120Hz!
I’m about 23 hours into the game at this point if anybody wants to DM me any questions
    Respond to ppl in dms. You have some light gameplay spoilers on this thread. It a no spoiler thread. I dont get why ppl are discussing this here
    How's weapon variety? I don't need numbers, but please tell me we get more than 6. My biggest gripe with Remake was the lack of weapons.
        Well I’m only 23 hours into the game which isn’t very much. I’ve been 100% every region before moving on and I’m just now about to leave the 2nd region. So far I have 3 weapons with Aerith and I think only two for all my other party members. I will say there are a lot of skills now that aren’t tied to weapons
    [deleted]
    Is the tankceratops there?
My game of the year
Just finished the game. Holy hell.
    Do you play as zack?
Lots of talk about the direction they took the story, we're in for a ride. I like what they did with remake so I'm up for some crazy, I just think it will further piss off the purists
Longest week of my life
I’m not going to read too many of the reviews because I want to go in fairly blind, but just judging on how people are talking about the overall structure of the game (big setpiecey main story segments broken up by extended time in open areas with lots of minigames), it kind of sounds like they made a Final Fantasy VII Yakuza game which sounds pretty sweet!
I’m in the ff xvi sub and I think there is real animosity, I think there real hate coming from xvi fan boys and I’m guessing review bombing is coming from them.

For me, I played ff xvi, it’s good but has flaws that has prevented me doing a second play through.  I loved remake and played it multiple times, love rebirth and I know I will likely do a replay on hard mode.  That is how I judge how good a game is, do I want to play the game again to experience all it has to offer.
Metacritic full of braindeads who don’t even own the game trying to doom it every day. Go fucking look for a job mate. Useless pricks and bots.

People is absolutely crazy, I mean look at this deficient:

https://preview.redd.it/beoqvhw6jomc1.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=21a5ead650cebc900ac4aadb8dbf7c25e9a709b5

He didn’t even play it mate wtf
    They're getting slightly less dumb though.

Instead of review bombing the game with 0's and 1's with unintelligible drivel, they're now review bombing it with 4's and 5's, also with unintelligible drivel to try and circumvent whatever troll detection MC has.
I was here from the start
I just got goosebumps !
I’m so happy, 93 on the meta. LFG
Huh, I'm surprised at all these 9s and 10s. All the articles I got were more in the 8 region (which is still dang good of course)


General consensus I was getting that it's a good game but a bit overstuffed with diversions from the plot. A segment playing as Cait Sith frequently came up as a negative.
    >A segment playing as Cait Sith frequently came up as a negative.

The more things change, the more they stay the same lol. People still be hating on poor Cait Sith 😭
So hyped to see the game is knocking it out of the park!! This wait is gonna be even more excruciating now
WOOW !! Just WOOOW !! Surpassed my expectations !
As someone who primarily games on PC but does own a PS5, I'm having a hard time choosing whether to wait or buy it now and probably end up double dipping.
    Bruh. Me too. I'll probably double dip and pray that the PC version doesn't have issues like Remake did. You had to mod it to run it decently.
Well I got a shipping update from Square. Initial delivery is March 1st but there's a chance that drops to release day as the initial delivery eta isn't always accurate.
I'm \~80 hours in now and almost done. I think I need 10-15 more hours to finish the remaining side content and get max scores in all the minigames. This is a very interesting game to rate. The game has so many flaws, from graphic issues to slow traversal mechanics and annoying QTEs to some bad character writing. But despite all these problems it has been a 10/10 experience for me. There are so many amazing things here that the issues are not large enough to ruin the experience. They are relatively minor annoyances. Out of my 80 hours I have thoroughly enjoyed at least 75 and had a dozen "wow" moments. If you make a list and nitpick everything that's wrong with the game I can see how people arrive at 8/10. But if you look at the big picture of what this game does it's a 10/10 to me.
With 131 reviews now on MC, and a couple of 10/10 scores, Rebirth is sitting at 92.98%. 

Another 10 and it'll go back up to 93.
    Another 95 rating would be enough for 93
        2 new reviews 95 and 90 then.
    It’s 93 on metacritic again  ,but I count 92.99%
I don’t think the game deserves perfect scores and I’m not hating, it just really doesn’t
Some of these comments are wild. The scores were absolutely deserved, this is a top tier RPG.
Sweating cuz a couple of these seem to agree the ending is bad lol
    All the reviews I have read so far agree that the plot got a little convoluted and the game would have been better off without these additions, although they don't really ruin the game experience
        Exactly the same as Remake then
    I'd be sweating more if this was the 3rd game not the 2nd as even if Rebirth had the worst ending ever there is another game. The ending of the 3rd game is really what matters as even if Rebirth had the best ending ever it'd mean little if the next one was terrible.
        Agreed. All the ending for part 2 really needs to do is keep people engaged for part 3. The ending of that game is the one that could potentially make or break the entire trilogy
    you have to ask yourself if it's bad because the storywriting quality can't measure up, or if they are biased against it because a massive number of people have their rose-tinted glasses permanently adhered to their face when they think of the original FF7.  


you'd be surprised by how often it's because of the latter.
    The GameSpot review goes a bit into detail of why the ending is bad - without spoiling anything, it seems like one major plot point has been changed in a way that doesn't track with the characters motivations and takes away from what made these characters so great to begin with.

Hopefully it'll be one of those endings that doesn't work until we see how it pays off in Part 3, and then we'll be able to appreciate it for what it sets up rather than being disappointed for what it isn't.
    More confusing than anything. Which is not suprising. Will likely get answer in part 3 tho.
GOTY incoming guys . It been long time to see 93 for a final fantasy game series ! Let’s go Rebirth hype 👏
My guess of 93 Metacritic score is correct... for now
We won folks, let's gooooo!
Gameranx said in their review that performance mode looks much better in comparison to the demo
    There are also reviews that point out graphical issues, but not many.

"On top of that, textures on other pieces of geometry such as interior design items such as chairs and planks are also a blurry, low-resolution mess. The graphical inconsistencies will without doubt take you out of the experience, especially when a lot of the game does look wonderfully done."

[https://hardcoregamer.com/review-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/](https://hardcoregamer.com/review-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/)

" Performance mode definitely has some dodgy resolution scaling going on at times, but it allows a smooth 60 frames-per-second for the vast majority of Rebirth's runtime. Graphics mode, meanwhile, is noticeably sharper in terms of resolution (it's hard not to be), but you're stuck at 30fps."  
[https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth)
I wholeheartedly don’t understand how people were realistically like 10-12 hours into the game just arriving in Junon and have so much to critique on with having more negative points than anything. There’s so much content and new features that gets added down the line and adds immersion with more new areas and exploration and combat after more and more progress. Meanwhile there’s so many reviews and fast critics speaking fully on the game without even being anywhere far from the start of the game, it’s wild from a real point but that’s critics 2024 for you.
    This. Seems like the biggest issue is people jumping to conclusions very early on and having no idea that the game changes so much later on. It’s so dumb!
Our review:

https://questdaily.com.au/playstation/review-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-playstation-5/
    Really enjoyed this review. I was excited for the mini-games but it seems they all have some decent depth to them.
Goty 2024 here we comeeee
I’m 16 hours into the game so far and I’m super happy to see most of the reviewers are echoing my own extremely happy thoughts
[deleted]
    It’s really ignorant to brush up people’s opinion by calling them fanboys. 

Even without having played the original, it’s obvious that the ending of the first part was awful and didn’t fit with the rest of the story. It’s obvious that the game would have been much better without it and without the ghosts. 
    I mean, controversial endings are fine, but I think the criticism in the reviews is that the ending isn't coherent/takes a deep dive into the craziest jrpg/space opera pool.  A head spinning ending that can't be logically plugged into the rest of the game/story would be a bit of a bummer.  We'll see I guess.
    Comments like yours are so damn childish. Don't take criticism of the game so personally.
    The only fanboy here is you, offending people that criticize the ending of the Remake
    Yeah right. Nothing more fanboyee than you there trying to shame people for fairly criticizing potentially shitty writing of the ending. 

Strong ”Make it stupid! I like when the media I consume is poorly written! Serve those fanboys right for getting invested” vibes.
        whats funny is that its ironically more fanboy-like to get mad and whine about it anytime someone critiques something
    “whiny fanboys” how DARE people criticize things they dislike
I'm just gonna say it...Game of the Year!!!

I know it's a bit early, but I would really love it. 
Let's have a good time playing Rebirth. One more week.
What happened to influencers don't have review codes yet? People have nearly 100% completion on the game already. We gotta issue a retraction on that one lol.
Freaking 93 Metascore , yes baby , hype level is maxed
Preloaded it over night, hopping on at 00:00 Thursday then have a half day and Friday off! Can't wait!
    Working until 11:30 on Thursday, picking up my copy at gamestop at noon, then I'm playing through the weekend! Can't wait
I see that haters are doing everything they can to trash the game and review bomb it. I hope it wins GOTY just to relish at their disappointment. Rebirth is in a completely different league then Remake (which I loved a lot). Also, I'm not saying the game is perfect but it's clear they went all out and nobody can diminished that. One of the greatest if not the best FF ever made. Can't wait for Part 3
    Greatest FF and probably JRPG of all time , ending isn’t that bad , the more I watched it the more I understand it
I think having a controversial ending affected the scores a lot. The ending is one of the last things you see and if that is not according to your taste it will leave a bad aftertaste, regardless of how great the game is.

So u think with a universally liked ending they could even reach 95.
Of course Gamespot downgrades to an 8 out of 10. That shithole is about as bad as IGN
So it appears the ending is another case of "trust us, we're great writers" (still have flashbacks of every character becoming braindead and communicating with grunts the moment chapter 18 started), but I'm still super excited for the game
Hmm, I’ve seen 6 writers across 5 different outlets all bring up or outright complain about content bloat and story pacing.

How much that affected their enjoyment differs, but I’m definitely glad I read that so I can temper my expectations a bit before going in myself.
    Given the demos and what we know, this is a huge game. We had previously heard 40 hours to complete it but it's looking closer to 60 to 100 hours. A long game can be fun, but also overwhelming
Let’s go!!!!!!

My prediction was right!!!!

We are in for the golden age again mates!!!!!!
PRAISE BE TO THE SQUARE GODS 🙏🏼🙌🏼
How I can wait 1 week more , damn anyway I try to avoid spoilers of the end maybe I delete social Media completely
    Keep playing the demo. I’m at 6 hours between both
    This is probably the last post / content you should see until next Thursday 
So...where can I read proper spoilers now, interested in how it all goes even if I'm not buying.
    [deleted]
Idk if this is considered a spoiler, but can/have any reviewers confirmed/speak on if you’re able to acquire leviathan without having a DLC save on your system?
    I haven’t seen Leviathan mentioned yet, outside the Remake/Intermission carryover
Let's go!
How far zoomed in or out do you have the camera in and out of battle?

Cause in Remake I had it all the way zoomed out but now since the world is so big I'm thinking maybe I should make it zoomed in as much as possible (cause the world icons are all so small)
    I really liked where the camera was placed in remake. I find the zoomed out camera in rebirth really weird. It makes the gameplay look more chaotic than it already is. I’m hoping we can zoom in a decent amount.
might as well ask it here: the summon rewards for owning remake+ intergrade, I cant find a "intergrade" save file on my storage dont know why- maybe I deleted it 2 years ago. should I re-install the game and get a save file, or will it go by my achievement/ownership?
    I looked it up and it seems like you definitely need the save file for Intergrade and Intermission, so trophies won't cut it. The good news is that you don't need to complete the games. Just save at the first chance that you get and it should unlock. I got the info from this article, so take it with a grain of salt. Worse case scenario, you'll have to finish Remake and the DLC again.

I love rebirth. I can’t wait for the release. So excited. Anyone else not able to post here anymore?
    No new posts are allowed right now. The sub is currently in lockdown to avoid leaks and spoilers. You should be able to comment, but not make posts in the general, tech, demo, and suggested threads that are referred to in this thread: https://reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1ax1lk2/lockdown_initiated_launch_discussion_thread_index/
Can anyone recommend a good, spoiler free review? Written or video, doesn't matter
    I'd say Easy Allies for video, Gene Park for written.
        Thanks for the Easy Allies suggestion. As if I wasn't already extremely hyped lol
I’ve never been this excited for a game release before. I played the heck out of the demo and can’t wait for the game to come out. Can you guys share your coping strategies? 😅
    Just leveling up other jobs in 14. It's mindless, takes time, and I can easily drop it once rebirth comes out. Just trying not to pay attention to the countdown on the PS5 dashboard.
Just started downloading right now! Doesn't look like I'll be sleeping tonight
Currently at Chapter 6. So far game feels like an improvement on Remake. It's not perfect, but nevertheless, I have been grinning ear to ear throughout most of it.
I love the story, characters, atmosphere of the locations, and music.


I hate the janky minigames every 5 minutes, the constant interruption in battles when trying to do your own thing, and the awful environmental design in terms of getting from A to B.
graphics aren’t as good as remake, but i guess that’s to be expected. all the blurry textures are extremely jarring though. playing remake and rebirth back to back, remake also just feels a lot smoother, to me at least. also they totally botched the weapon upgrade system.. ugh
They were confident with these early reviews and it shows. Very happy when developers got to make the game they wanted to make. 29th is a long way for me lol
Id say its higher than ff9 arguably because ff9 only had like 20 something reviews.
Square, i give you permission to drink your damn. Tea. You earned it.
Solid, no spoils review.
I wanted to read that review so bad but I'm not paying.
I knew Rebirth would be a hit.  Just sounds like it absolutely surpasses Remake.  Can't wait.
    It was guranteed a hit in the jrpg fandom. But with a score like this, i hope it brings in a lot of casual gamers and SE gets those sales numbers
Ff9 only has like 20 something reviews so not the biggest sample size. So its arguable that rebirth is the highest rated ff game of all time
    yeah but kind of misleading as well- because just like with ff7, 8 and 9 most reviews back then was in gaming magazines, you got 100s of them and they scored very very well in those.
Damn. Up there with the all-time greats. So happy for SE and CBU1! We have a classic incoming.
The ending is going to be divisive regardless.  Some like it, some don't and I imagine that'll be the same with the fanbase.
    Yeah agreed. Honestly, part of me likes Square having the cojones, I like it when people take risks, and can appreciate that some people don't. As long as it's not incomprehensible, I'm fairly open-minded about it
        Square is at its finest when it's busy taking risks. Stranger of Paradise is a good example. Incomprehensibly, it's a good game despite boring level design, a story that takes almost the entire runtime of the game to get going and gameplay that feels like diet Nioh, despite some pretty compelling class design.

I love risk-taking Square. They're my favorite.
        A review literally calls it incomprehensible lol
Gene has a good takes a lot, I trust him
Based on the leaks and reviews, some of those critics don't seem wrong.
Happy someone else sees this. Cant believe so many are being negative. The last time a FF game got review scores this high half the people in this comments section weren't even alive.
I didn't read the entire review cause I expected spoilers. However in the VERDICT section at the end, there is a mention about the ending and how SE fumbles with it. That in itself isnt a spoiler just a judgement on the quality of the ending. Its what comes after that which dives deep into spoiler territory by discussing the vibe/type of ending it is as well as other critical elements surrounding this.

Overall its really said that IGN had to do this....
The GameSpot review says *a lot* about the ending too.
I watched the IGN video review and I didn't really see or notice anything major?
    One of his final closing lines is VERY leading in relation to certain characters, I honestly think you're better off not watching it again if you didn't catch it. Also there's footage of one of the major bosses.
I just watched it - It 'could' spoil it.
It's not a direct spoiler, it's more of a read-between-the-lines spoiler, but yes - it's pretty bad on IGN's part...
Thank you for the warning, I may have played the OG game but I rather not know what's the same or different at "ALL!"
I just don’t understand why reviewers are incapable of offering spoiler-free reviews. GameSpot’s unnecessary breakdown of the ending just about ruined my damn week. To describe myself as angry would be an understatement. Why couldn’t they just write “didn’t like the ending, it’ll be controversial, will offer more details in a follow-up article that includes spoilers” and leave it at that? 

I’m going to be grumbling about this for the rest of 2024…
    Don’t worry, that’s not the biggest spoiler imo. 
There’s a big one that’s right in front of your eyes, even in the demo. Not going to say anything more. 
    Sorry to hear. I hope you still buy the game and have a great experience. Unfortunately while details of the ending may have been ruined for you....there is still 50-80 hours of excitement to lead up to that.

As for Gamespot....its par for the course for them. Its almost as if its part of their review methodology to give plot specific in their reviews going all the way back to some spoilers I read in a Mass Effect 2 review.

At least they should be considerate and give a warning before they say what they need to say.
    Yeah its a complete c\*nt move by them. Spoilerful reviews are fine but NOT before the game is even released, it shouldn't even be an option, even if they put a disclaimer in front.
Just found this on Twitter, couldn’t be more excited for the team

https://preview.redd.it/1gudidhgx5kc1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6442555d5308624b2b6a579b8d60edc0d29c47dc
Agreed!! I’m so happy for them, I can only imagine how they’re celebrating right now looking at these reviews
Maybe single player but the last 2 14 expansions are both in the 90s
Actually the highest (unless you consider Zelda a JRPG) along with Persona 5. 


Actually it's in the top 5 JRPGs ever acording to metacritic (FF9, Chrono Cross, P4, P5 and FF7R)
    Some of these older games have less reviews but yea 93 is bonkers. For reference games like Bloodborne have a 91, God of war Ragnarok has 94, Halo 3 has 94, as does original MW and bioshock. I use those as examples of the company rebirth is in now in terms of review scores. Very cool to see
I know right. 

I was just looking through metacritic at the scores of some of the most popular RPG's and Rebirth is a full 10 points more than some of them, like Ghost Of Tsushima which had 83, Horizon FW got 88. Etc. 

This is gonna be a slow week.
yeah but in 97 we had gaming magazines, not internet reviews we went by, and for ex the one in sweden gave it a 97/100. you include the 90s reviews and it wouldnt be close.
    you're not wrong, it was all 10s and high 90s in magazines when it released.(UK) Such was it's impact.
It has like 6x the reviews too, which is extremely impressive.
I think that's the clip Famitsu shared today? I had to take a moment lmao
It's possible that they'll look at the reception 16 and this game receives, compare, and lean in that direction going forward for the mainline entries.

Need to wait and see.
With 94 reviews, I don't see it changing much.  Maybe 92 at worst.

Still, regardless, an overwhelming success.
We have been waiting for this for more than 2 decades!
    What a wait it’s been!
Wait, but if you order the pizza ahead of time, you can have it by the time you reach home!  
  
Otherwise, love this plan
    You genius
I'm gonna be pre-loading the digital delixe edition so as soon a midnight hits, I'll be ready to go, booked time off, so it's gonna be an all nighter with pizza, coffee and beer, haven't had an insane gaming session in so long, cannot fucking wait.
... and here people were thinking Tifa was nerfed by Square Enix.  The sports bra was just working overtime.  


https://i.redd.it/pgqv4sbr28kc1.gif
    Tbh even with the sports bra they look very big.

I think too many chronically online people fail to realize that real women who have breasts like Tifa's are in fact considered very, very well endowed, lol. 

The whole nerf narrative was always silly.

>Touch wood

I definitely am
    Lmao
That just for there to be 7 leftover I think. It's a nod to squares love of 7s. Should've been 97.
Did Cait Sith have better character development than OG?
How many enemy skills are there? Does each character get their own moments to shine?
Are you able to upgrade weapons like in Remake, so that for example the buster sword is still a viable weapon to use in the endgame?
    Weapon upgrading is very different. Weapon skill tree's are gone. Instead, each weapon has different strengths and weaknesses, and those kinda stay that way through the whole game. One new aspect though, are weapons level from using them, and each time a weapon "levels", you unlock a new passive skill that character can equip regardless of the weapon in there hand.

I finished the game with Buster Sword in hand.
        Do you get more materia slots though or does the number stay the same for each upgrade?
Did the game have a lot of bosses with pre-determined teams or do you get to pick your team for most bosses?
are there huge optional monsters to fight?
    This game has more than its fair share of tough big bosses to hunt down.
Listing Queen's Blood being too addictive as a Negative got me chuckling (I understand it's meant as a joke and not something you docked points for)
    IT'S SO ADDICTING. Its both a blessing and a curse.
How long is the main game? If I breezed through.
    I'd say if you breezed through it and ignored everything else, probably 40 hours if I had to guess. It's hard for me to discern because I did a lot of exploration and secret stuff.
Can I go back to areas from the previous chapters without doing the chapter again to explore missed areas?  

And, is exploration somewhat organic, can I stumble upon caves/areas and find good items encounter bosses etc? Kinda like Elden Ring did?
    There are some chapters where you have access to a bunch of the open world locations and you can freely explore them. It doesn't have the same dynamic stumbling upon things such as Elden Ring, but the open world quests and activities often build toward something larger and more connected, and the rewards are always worth it.
        Ok that's good enough for me. The heavy chapter based replay factor of the first game put me off replaying to find missed collectibles so I was hoping they'd steer from that design.  

Can't wait to get in there next week!  

EDIT: I internally call it the "stumble upon factor" but since I have not used it in public I figured no one knows what I mean, but yeah Elden Ring is S tier Stumble Upon Factor, SUF.
Was the performance any better in the real game compared to the demo?
    About the same if I had to wager. It was never something where I would complain about it as the scale and some of the later moments are so impressive.
Did you find the ending and the moments leading up to and after it fitting of the OG? Was it confusing?
At 138 hours, is that doing everything in the game or attempt to completing everything? Asking as a completionist 
    SOme of that is me trying to do everything, but I'm also documenting it for work, taking videos etc. I could have done just about everything by the 100 hour mark if that was my sole focus. I've been taking in the view a bit ya know, enjoying it.
Is there any depth to any of the mini games or are they all bare bones?
    There is. Often a mini-game will be part of the story, and then you are fre to replay it and chase for high scores. They also have a multitude of unlocks that are pretty damn good. I'm talking like, actual character weapons and stuff you can't get anywhere else.
Would you say the demo is a good example of what the open world feels like? Just running around killing monsters between towns? Because if so I am perfectly fine with that!
    Yes, but the full game has more to see and do in each open world, and the demo has none of the larger story beats some of these side activities lead to down the road.
Highest rated FF of all time after IX actually. Abive 6,7,8...
Famitsu gave FF16 and FF7 remake 39/40. 🤔
Yeah, I really feel the people that liked Remakes ending, will probably like this ending too. The ones that don't like the pull aways from the OG might not.

Edit: This is pure speculation, I have not seen any leaks or know anything outside of official posts by Square.
I think, like anything FF7 related, it divides opinion, but at least people know that this time going into Rebirth that this isn't a 1:1 remake of the OG and things might be different.  It's not like they are completely blindsided this time like they were with Remake.

The game received about 40 10/10 scores across the review board, which is ridiculous.  You don't give a game those scores if the ending doesn't stick, so whilst there are a lot of reviewers that either didn't like the ending or were pretty meh about it, there's a lot of others that did enjoy it.

We'll just have to wait and see how fans react.
There is no such thing as neutral reviews. Humans have preferences. That's not just true for the narrative. Some reviewers loved the open world, others hated it. Many praised the sidequests, some hated them.

Your best bet is to watch a reviewer whose preferences align with yours.
I'm on PST so it'll be out within 15 hours...I'm so excited that I can't sleep man.
    I'm not sure if I will sleep tonight either as the game will be playable at midnight in the UK...
No I get it. I hate being a fanboy cheering for a company, but after a year of discourse about XVI and people wanting it to fail and reports of how the franchise is being left in the dust by its competitors, I started to wonder if they were right and this series is just in a downward decline. Not to mention that I myself didn't love XVI when it was all said and done.

So seeing so many people rate it so highly and the passion that the team has for the game just makes me smile. Like all of their hard work is paying off.
If you want to get emotional, read the WashingtonPost's review.  Holy shit. I'm hyped right now.
Same here. Odd isn't it.
Not weird tbh, I think it makes sense.
Damn it I wish I saw this comment first 
Gene Park also loved it too, from WaPo.
Scores usually drop over time as more reviews come out across a broader range of media. XVI was over 90 at first too, but ended up in the mid 80s. We'll see how it goes with this, but the overall impression seems to be an improvement on Remake, so hoping it remains over 90.
    Its not going to drop much it already has over 77 reviews.

XVI already dropped below 90 by that point.
    It’s now at 93 with 113 reviews, so it’s basically impossible for it to fall much if at all anymore 
if the ending does not spawn a massive number of youtube videos analyzing and theorizing what comes next like Remake did, I’ll be somewhat disappointed, lol. Had so much fun watching those back in the days.
    Exactly!!!! That’s like my favorite part of this remake trilogy lol I absolutely love Square’s reimagining of this story
        yeah, if they somehow can keep us talking about part 3 until it comes out, I think it’s a success.
I'd argue that some of those reviewers might not even be that deep down the rabbit hole regarding the new aspects of this version of the story, to make sense of all of it. As you said, sometimes it takes time to properly digest events that happened differently and to try to reason why they changed certain things and where it leads. This limited amount of time will surely not be enough to take it all in, just going by Remake. And something creative choices are just divisive by nature, can't do much about that.
Divisive endings are often my favorite. Usually means they took a chance on something
Honestly that was my impression just from watching the trailers. It looks like Rebirth is expanding on so much that the first game really was like a test run.
It really does make part 1 look like a prologue
Back to 93,0088 Average if it's 85 instead of 80.
Yeah, that is weird.
Yeah, it should be 85. I wonder if we can somehow  report it to metacritic...
    17/20=85 i commented on jeuxactu youtube channel but they deleted my comment.
        They replied to someone and they said that their score is 17, but they actually changed it on their website to 16. Wow this is shitty move...
Really strange.  They gave Helldivers the same score but it's counted as a 85 on metacritic.
I can't believe they said this game would run perfectly fine on a PS4...
Wtf
They've changed it to 16/20 now.
DARTHH BRO WE DID IT, I tried @ you in gfaqs but didn’t work.

93 on meta with 116 reviews. What a day and what a game. Now time to sort out that AMA 👀
    YESSS!

Sorry I haven't logged on there for a day or two, kinda took a step away and went outside :D 

Don't know if I can do an AMA now as the sub is on lockdown, might just write a comment on the endgame discussion thread or something and people can post under there.
Thank you for the fun on the deleted thread. 
He can sometimes let his personal preferences hype him up a little more than I'd agree with, for example I'm pretty sure he said XVI was the best FF when it came out, but I generally agree he's a pretty solid reviewer. 

He usually gives a very good overview of what you can expect from a game.
Being a FF fan was ROUGH over the last 20 years.

But they finally did it, after 20 years of patiently waiting and dreaming of the "PS1 FF games modernized" we finally got it.

They fucking did it.
    Exactly. Not to mention this game covers the parts where I became a true FF fan so if one game had to break it I wanted it to be this one
Seems clear why Square lifted the embargo so early now
Well, a 93 would have put it on par with the likes of RE4, and behind BG3 and TOTK.

I think it would have been nominated at the expense of one of Alan Wake 2, Spiderman 2 or Super Mario Wonder and not looked out of place.
The world feels absolutely massive. You won’t be dissapointed
I always loved the original Midgar section, but I also totally feel what you’re saying about that first realization that the game is only just beginning on the other side of its walls. 

Story-wise, Remake improved on a few iconic moments of the original (opening bombing mission, walking across the rooftops with Aerith, Turks being challenging adversaries) and added a bit of narrative depth to other areas (the magnitude of Hojo and Shinra’s evil, Barret and Marlene’s relationship). But it also padded/dragged a few chapters out past being enjoyable (sun lamp maze, train graveyard, climb to the plate, and even some of the Hojo floor). And Chapter 18, while undeniably epic in the combat department, was a weird mess with a clearly tacked-on final boss. 

All of which is to say, I don’t know exactly what to expect in Rebirth, but if it can have the good sense of not stretching the less crucial narrative moments too thin, I’m certain it will be an excellent game. Regardless, the sense of more freedom and what looks like an improved combat system will carry the day.
Idk about others, but the original Midgar section is absolutely my favorite part of the game, the other cities are cool, but Midgar feels truly “alive”, and there’s so much happening in terms of world building, characterization and emotional/funny moments in such a short amount of time.

The other areas are just don’t feel as fleshed out as Midgar, there’s about 5hrs of story/gameplay dedicated to this introduction to the world of FF7.

It also helps that i’m a huge Blade Runner fan, and Midgar has that cyberpunk narrative/aesthetic.
That review was awesome.
I’m salivating
thanks for letting us know, we will pin this as a comment so everyone sees it.
    Good work! Thx
Yeah I just watched their review and definitely wish I hadn’t. It was a little too spoilery for my taste.
FFXIV did pretty good, for what it's worth expansion-wise. But it's nice to see Rebirth kick ass.
Watch as he misunderstands and gives us a goat farming mechanic in FF3R instead.
Nojima-san is a fkn treasure man!
there were like 3 comments like that, usually with people calling them out on their BS

one of the people criticizing the author of the review was literally just named “Donald J Trump” so im pretty sure he’s a troll
The author of that review actually memed about regretting putting such a "high grade" initially, he felt too generous and should have put 15 from the start. Look I get not liking the game, but that just fucking malicious at this point.
It’s also missing a 5/5 review from the Daily Star
The game touts that 100+ hours of content, theres really no game out that has 100% non-filler side content with that kind of length (Not even Witcher 3 is perfect theres very repetitive side quest design even if it is the usual benchmark for Open World), and they went the extra mile to pack a ton of mini-games ontop. Its an achievement regardless.
    True enough. I'm just hoping that a good percentage of that side content is quests with some engaging side stories and character moments. I could do without the open world waymark hunting sort of thing, but if that's in addition on top of the more interesting stuff then it's ok (and optional), and if the world is good enough then more reason to explore it is a positive.
82 HOURS for story alone? Surely they were dabbling in every side quest/mini game they could. 

Just did a quick peek and Part 1 was an average of 42 hours with main story & 'extras'. Is IGN claiming this game is twice as long as Part 1?
    Not for story alone. IGN has another article detailing the game time of 5 different employees. The fastest went through at 33 hours focusing on just the main story. The longest employee took over 97 hours.
    FightinCowboy (a popular Let's Play Youtuber) said you could probably get through it in about 40 hours if you done nothing but the main story progression.

I can see this having quite a diverse playtime from 50-120 hours as very few people will hightail the main story and do nothing else.
    Didn't watch the IGN review, but all the other reviews put the main story at 35-45 hours if you ignore all side content. Close to 100 hours if you do all side content.
Yeeeeeah, I literally just hit the pause on the review. They didn't say it DIRECTLY, but the "the ending gives a message about >!grieving!< said it all. >!Not saying that I'm surprised. I was in the camp of wanting to see things play out differently for Aerith - moreso the HOW it happens, and not it not happening.!<
I’m playing the game early. I’m 16 hours in and I’m still a few hours away from finishing up all the Junon stuff
The Polygon article? What are they playing at 😐
I want to “thank” the GameSpot reviewer for spoiling Rebirth for me. 

And by “thank”, I mean punch that bastard in the mouth.
I did myself a favor long ago and stopped consuming their content.  Life's been great ever since.
does it have to do with you-know-who or is it other stuff?? i want to read it if its about her and her only

EDIT: watched the end of the gamespot review, if anyone wants to know, DM me
Part 3 better be a 100/100 game with this progression
Don't forget Nojima.
    Nojima you legend.
        Endo (battle director) also a legend
            The biggest legend from my perspective, this battle system is straight fire. 

One of the best in gaming, for my money.
            He's the real MVP!
As a fanbase we're so unbelievably lucky to still have this group at SE and still working while continuing to honor the source material with the reverence it deserves.  It's pretty remarkable.  What a time to be alive for FF fans.
Uematsu!  The music in these games are a fantastic reimagining and extension of his music
    Add Hamauzu and Suzuki too, their takes on Nobuo's work and their original compositions are a crucial part of this whole project!
        Yeah, even through Square Enix's struggles, there have been incredibly talented composers all over the company.  The soundtracks never disappoint.
All things considered it’s the best rated FF game ever.

FFIX may technically have a higher rating but it only has 22 reviews. 

Rebirth has way more perfect scores/reviews and managed to maintain an equal rating.
Whereas Amazon in the UK delivered my copy a day early.
A lot of ppl did. I personally expected anywhere from 90-94 especially when intergrade got 89 and just based off the demo, rebirth plays so much better imo
I was expecting low 90s as many other people were. There was a post about it several days ago, the lowest estimated score I saw was like 80
Because that’s the part with the most change is my guess.
It sounds like they tried to have it both ways with the ending from what I can infer
different strokes for different folks
Can you point out exactly which review said that, I’d like to read myself? Thank you!
don't wish the time away, enjoy the simmer of anticipation and take your time savoring when it's finally here.  


im replaying FF7 Remake and getting around to doing the Intermission dlc, so i'm pretty excited about that.
Oh yeah, in Damiana I trust, when it comes to RPGs and he loves it.
And they put a good 20 seconds on the Cosmo Canyon theme in there.
Can't wait for their spoiler discussion with Max where he's able to predict the title for the third game four years in advance.
I wish I saw this comment earlier, I just read the Gamespot review and they make it so damn obvious what happens in the end, literally on the verge of spelling it out. They really need to edit their review.
I mean, to be fair, some games can be too big for their own good.

However I highly doubt this will be one of those games.

And yes, Polygon always has shit takes. They suck. I don't give them clicks any more.
Bigger is not always better. A lot of padding and busywork can feel like a slog or break pacing. Not saying that's the case here (obviously I haven't played the game nor have I read this specific review to know the context), just a general comment. Some prefer a smaller, more focused experience.
That’s exactly what it is. Saw one that said the sheer amount of “enjoyable” (yes they called it enjoyable”) side content was a negative because it kept distracting from the main narrative. He legitimately complained that the side content was so engaging that he couldn’t stop it to continue the main story lol
    That's the best negative I've ever heard, sign me up.

Man I'm so hyped for this.
    This legitimately made me laugh when I read it.  I can't believe someone's that stupid to put a statement like that on the record.
        In fairness he gave the game an extremely high score but that was the issue he seemed to hammer on the most lol like the stuff is optional so he didn’t have to waste hours upon hours doing it
    Some of these complaints are ridiculous.

Imagine saying that the side-content is so good that you get distracted from the main narrative and perceiving that a negative.  Just don't do the side-content then.
Polygon and Kotaku are two of the worst gaming outlets in history. Stay far away
>Has Polygon always had such shit takes?

Always.
That's just what one reviewer did, they have an article where they each mention their finish times and the one who rushed through as fast as possible finished in 33.
FightinCowboy said he thinks mainstory without any side content is more like 40ish give or take
16 hours in and I definitely believe it
I don’t understand that perspective whatsoever. Square would have never received adequate funding to develop a literal 1:1 remake, nevermind the fact that it would be boring. The remake trilogy is by far the smartest and most creative way to handle this, it’s a remake *with* a reimagining. If someone is that upset over Square’s decision then just stick with the OG. People will find a way to complain about anything.
Honestly, you could give some of these people a bag of gold and they would complain that its too heavy.

Some people can never be satisfied by anything.
    When the first demo was released, were people happy and satisfied? Nope, everyone either 1) was immediately disappointed they still had to wait for release; or 2) complaining about the graphics

I mean, whatever criticism you have is fair, but it seemed like NOBODY was content after playing it for one reason or another
    It is just sad, man. Seriously. I am blown away they finally, after all these years of let downs have managed to revitalize the FF brand. 16, albeit not perfect, was a step in the right direction and it seems Rebirth is solidifying SE mission to bring glory back to Final Fantasy. Do these people not remember 15? Do they not remember the disaster that was 13? I am elated right now.
FFXVI's poor performance mode didn't affect it's final scores so I knew this wouldn't either.
Because at the end of the day, most reviewers and 99% of the general audience won't care about how it looks. We've seen this time and time again with games over the past few years.

Now this isn't to say people shouldn't be vocal about these issues. They absolutely should if it's important to them.
Normal people don’t care. Especially when the graphics mode looks so good and runs a consistent 30.
Most people don't care that's true, i only have an old 1080p tv so it probably won't bother me at all, been playing games sinnce the early 90s so things like resolution don't figure in. BUT...i've just read the PushSquare review and they definitely dock a point because of the issues. Shame
A lot of videos I watch are like 90% negative and then say "yeah game is 4.5/5" lol 
    Yeah, it's weird.

It feels like they're either over-scoring the game based on the criticism they're dishing out, or they're holding the VII series and reputation to such a ridiculously high standard that anything but perfect scores will result in a fair bit of criticism.
        Eh, I don't think that's totally the case. It's just more that those blemishes exist, but don't make the product a lesser product as a result. ACG made that clear in his review, most of the major issues he felt were on the technical end. Side content has been getting a lot of praise, story is as well with the only major blemish being some of the pacing, and the ending being divisive (with even some loving it like Gene Park,) and the world itself is getting tons of love. 

I wouldn't think too hard about it. Blemishes exist in every product, even some of the highest rated ever. Whether or not they hurt the product as a whole is another topic, and going off these reviews, it doesn't seem like they do.
Welcome to modern YouTube/Podcast sensationalism. They will go wherever they "think" their audience wants to hear which is the controversial stuff based off of the precedent set by Remake.
Important to note that NSP was very critical of Remake, so for him to be praising this game this much means more than usual. 

But honestly, there is not a single aspect of Remake (combat, character arcs, interactions with the characters, worldbuilding, bosses, sidequests, minigames, story, dialogue, VA, art, dungeon design...) that is better than Rebirth. If you didn't enjoy Remake as much, very big possibility you will fall in love with Rebirth, and if you loved Remake, this will be a very unique gaming experience. Enjoy all.
That's definitely a 10/10 review. The story criticisms are pretty much the same as from other reviews and the same as in Remake. He says game does it best when it tries to faithfully remake the OG FF7, but sometimes fumbles stuff with the new additions, but overall still a very good story.
Yeah, if I remember, he was another one that really didn't like the direction Remake went and was a bit tepid on the game as a whole.

I imagine he'll still have some issues with the narrative as he alluded to it, but the fact that the game is scoring big DESPITE these issues is testament to it's overall quality.
> Only issues he highlighted (without going into story spoilers) was that some of the late game dungeons make Hojo's Lab look like a cakewalk

The only issue here is whether this sounds awesome or *very* awesome.
There is a talking lab rat dog and Barrett and yuffie, why wouldn’t there be diversity in this game? it’s established from og 7
    Yeah, it's ridiculous.

It's a fictional fantasy world, they can populate it with whatever the fuck they want.
I always took metacritic user reviews with a grain of salt but now its just totally compromised by trolls. 
Dude, srsly wtf?
Part of my problem with this criticism is that the OG game had tons of mini games. That's just sort of what I was expecting
I want 100+ minigames
>too many minigames

take their keyboards away. shame.
whatever happens at the end is bound to piss off roughly half the fanbase either way
it's possible, but unlikely we'll create a second thread for reviews. usually discussion of the reviews dies out when the game is released. at that point there is the chapter by chapter discussion threads where things can be discussed until the sub is back open to normal pre-release activity.
    Thanks for locking the sub down BTW! I was getting nervous about spoilers with copies out in the wild now. I think you guys are taking the right approach with the chapter discussion threads.
        You’re welcome. Thanks for the positive feedback. Many have disagreed, but we feel it’s the right thing to do.
Very unlikely.  Usually scores go down over time, not up.

If anything, it's more likely to go down to 92 than up to 94, but with 120 odd reviews, it may hold at 93.
    It's a 92 already
        Yes added new 4 reviews and score decreased to 92.
Eurogamer Germany gave it 80. Also JeuxActu 80, gamersky 95 , Merlin 94

It can be back to 93 if it gets 100 for 3 more reviews or 95 for 4 more reviews
we're working on it. if you see something, please report it.
Max Dood about to ascend to galaxy mind in the coming months. I can't wait to finish the game lol.
I am glad. One fear I had is because of Remake's ending being divisive, they would backtrack a little. If this is their vision, I want them to go full on that no matter whst. Once part 3 is released we can all discuss whether the vision worked or not, but I will always appreciate their courage and creativity. 
If they actually do change the ending, I'm more interested in how that may affect what will follow, and if it might just be a delayed outcome that is forced to happen eventually anyway, building a lot of dread in the meantime. If Remake told me one thing, it's not to overreact about the things they might change. Have faith in the devs, they said the core of the game won't change, we'll have to wait for it all to conclude to judge it properly.
And Red XIII was just a dude in a fur suit the whole time. Really blew my mind.
    truly unbelievable what they’ve done to this game!!!
Whoever reported this for “spoilers”… come on…
[removed]
It's a garbage website, it's Europe's Kotaku. l doesn't help that their video reviews sometimes differ from the written ones.
lmao hot new meme just dropped
[deleted]
    I actually am fairly purist about this in the sense that I expect it to be basically 90% faithful. Which it might be? I honestly can’t tell. 

Uh idk if this borders on spoilers because it’s kind of just my theory but just in case >! If my theory is correct, it will end up being faithful but over a longer story arc to the overall original themes. !<
        GamesRadar confirmed it was basically like Remake in their review.  90% faithful to the OG with some deviations.
        I've seen a bunch of reviews say that it's very faithful up until the very end.  It's just the final couple chapters that diverge, same as Remake.

Also your theory is very likely to be true based on developer comments.
    I've seen people say they're ruining what the OG game was, but I think if anyone knows the intent/spirit of OG it's the people who actually made the game in the first place lol
I’m positive the ending of this is left open-ended so that they don’t cut off half of the fanbase with whatever direction they go in 🤷🏻‍♀️ if you go with option A, people wanted option B will dip, and vice versa
I think Ff12 for the last mainline non mmo to score over 90.
FFXII I think.
"emotional"
    *flips hair*
I'm with you, reviews are still on the way (till the game releases and even after that) so there are  chances that it can rise up to a 93 again.
Well it is somehow desillusional (in a good way) that a main FF Title is back at a 90+ Score... in the golden Era of Square (90s early 2000s) FF6-FF12 (excluding 11 and sequels) were all 90+ scored games. Which is pretty crazy for a gaming series, having so many titles at such a very high score. It's nice to see that this series might can go back at the quality it once had.
Score stays consistent, already 120+ reviews so probably stays 92, min 91
It's currently sitting at 92.96% so it's very unlikely to go down to 91 with 120+ reviews in.
all i am picking up is "if you hated how they ended remake, you wont change your opinion here".  

Reminds me of watching a C-Drama (since the lady has been going hard on that shit as of late) and they just end the episode on a random sentence.  Yeah, it aint the best, but the rest of the show was good so idgaf.
Somehow, I see this as a good thing 
U cunt with that avatar lol. I fooled for it
So if you’ve played the demo you still have to play that section of the game up until you begin the trek up the mountain. That means you have to play the beginning section of Sephiroth fighting the monsters and Cloud exploring the village. Once you get to the mountain path the game offers to let you skip ahead to the village burning.

No spoilers but there is actually a fairly quick but major playable portion that takes place before the demo
I read from the game devs that it starts a bit higher than Remake, and the level cap is also higher (70 I think), but can't tell the level numbers for sure.
    Iirc, the starting level is around 20.

It's full of absolutely clownish negative reviews.
Look at these clowns.

Can you already play before 29th ?!
    I’m pretty sure you can with the disc version, there has never been a case where it was “locked” before release, at least from my experience!
        Which store? I live in London too!
Where did you get it?
Respond to ppl in dms. You have some light gameplay spoilers on this thread. It a no spoiler thread. I dont get why ppl are discussing this here
How's weapon variety? I don't need numbers, but please tell me we get more than 6. My biggest gripe with Remake was the lack of weapons.
    Well I’m only 23 hours into the game which isn’t very much. I’ve been 100% every region before moving on and I’m just now about to leave the 2nd region. So far I have 3 weapons with Aerith and I think only two for all my other party members. I will say there are a lot of skills now that aren’t tied to weapons
[deleted]
Is the tankceratops there?
Do you play as zack?
They're getting slightly less dumb though.

Instead of review bombing the game with 0's and 1's with unintelligible drivel, they're now review bombing it with 4's and 5's, also with unintelligible drivel to try and circumvent whatever troll detection MC has.
>A segment playing as Cait Sith frequently came up as a negative.

The more things change, the more they stay the same lol. People still be hating on poor Cait Sith 😭
Bruh. Me too. I'll probably double dip and pray that the PC version doesn't have issues like Remake did. You had to mod it to run it decently.
Another 95 rating would be enough for 93
    2 new reviews 95 and 90 then.
It’s 93 on metacritic again  ,but I count 92.99%
All the reviews I have read so far agree that the plot got a little convoluted and the game would have been better off without these additions, although they don't really ruin the game experience
    Exactly the same as Remake then
I'd be sweating more if this was the 3rd game not the 2nd as even if Rebirth had the worst ending ever there is another game. The ending of the 3rd game is really what matters as even if Rebirth had the best ending ever it'd mean little if the next one was terrible.
    Agreed. All the ending for part 2 really needs to do is keep people engaged for part 3. The ending of that game is the one that could potentially make or break the entire trilogy
you have to ask yourself if it's bad because the storywriting quality can't measure up, or if they are biased against it because a massive number of people have their rose-tinted glasses permanently adhered to their face when they think of the original FF7.  


you'd be surprised by how often it's because of the latter.
The GameSpot review goes a bit into detail of why the ending is bad - without spoiling anything, it seems like one major plot point has been changed in a way that doesn't track with the characters motivations and takes away from what made these characters so great to begin with.

Hopefully it'll be one of those endings that doesn't work until we see how it pays off in Part 3, and then we'll be able to appreciate it for what it sets up rather than being disappointed for what it isn't.
More confusing than anything. Which is not suprising. Will likely get answer in part 3 tho.
There are also reviews that point out graphical issues, but not many.

"On top of that, textures on other pieces of geometry such as interior design items such as chairs and planks are also a blurry, low-resolution mess. The graphical inconsistencies will without doubt take you out of the experience, especially when a lot of the game does look wonderfully done."

[https://hardcoregamer.com/review-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/](https://hardcoregamer.com/review-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/)

" Performance mode definitely has some dodgy resolution scaling going on at times, but it allows a smooth 60 frames-per-second for the vast majority of Rebirth's runtime. Graphics mode, meanwhile, is noticeably sharper in terms of resolution (it's hard not to be), but you're stuck at 30fps."  
[https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth)
This. Seems like the biggest issue is people jumping to conclusions very early on and having no idea that the game changes so much later on. It’s so dumb!
Really enjoyed this review. I was excited for the mini-games but it seems they all have some decent depth to them.
It’s really ignorant to brush up people’s opinion by calling them fanboys. 

Even without having played the original, it’s obvious that the ending of the first part was awful and didn’t fit with the rest of the story. It’s obvious that the game would have been much better without it and without the ghosts. 
I mean, controversial endings are fine, but I think the criticism in the reviews is that the ending isn't coherent/takes a deep dive into the craziest jrpg/space opera pool.  A head spinning ending that can't be logically plugged into the rest of the game/story would be a bit of a bummer.  We'll see I guess.
Comments like yours are so damn childish. Don't take criticism of the game so personally.
The only fanboy here is you, offending people that criticize the ending of the Remake
Yeah right. Nothing more fanboyee than you there trying to shame people for fairly criticizing potentially shitty writing of the ending. 

Strong ”Make it stupid! I like when the media I consume is poorly written! Serve those fanboys right for getting invested” vibes.
    whats funny is that its ironically more fanboy-like to get mad and whine about it anytime someone critiques something
“whiny fanboys” how DARE people criticize things they dislike
Working until 11:30 on Thursday, picking up my copy at gamestop at noon, then I'm playing through the weekend! Can't wait
Greatest FF and probably JRPG of all time , ending isn’t that bad , the more I watched it the more I understand it
Given the demos and what we know, this is a huge game. We had previously heard 40 hours to complete it but it's looking closer to 60 to 100 hours. A long game can be fun, but also overwhelming
Keep playing the demo. I’m at 6 hours between both
This is probably the last post / content you should see until next Thursday 
[deleted]
I haven’t seen Leviathan mentioned yet, outside the Remake/Intermission carryover
I really liked where the camera was placed in remake. I find the zoomed out camera in rebirth really weird. It makes the gameplay look more chaotic than it already is. I’m hoping we can zoom in a decent amount.
I looked it up and it seems like you definitely need the save file for Intergrade and Intermission, so trophies won't cut it. The good news is that you don't need to complete the games. Just save at the first chance that you get and it should unlock. I got the info from this article, so take it with a grain of salt. Worse case scenario, you'll have to finish Remake and the DLC again.

I'd say Easy Allies for video, Gene Park for written.
    Thanks for the Easy Allies suggestion. As if I wasn't already extremely hyped lol
Just leveling up other jobs in 14. It's mindless, takes time, and I can easily drop it once rebirth comes out. Just trying not to pay attention to the countdown on the PS5 dashboard.
It was guranteed a hit in the jrpg fandom. But with a score like this, i hope it brings in a lot of casual gamers and SE gets those sales numbers
yeah but kind of misleading as well- because just like with ff7, 8 and 9 most reviews back then was in gaming magazines, you got 100s of them and they scored very very well in those.
Yeah agreed. Honestly, part of me likes Square having the cojones, I like it when people take risks, and can appreciate that some people don't. As long as it's not incomprehensible, I'm fairly open-minded about it
    Square is at its finest when it's busy taking risks. Stranger of Paradise is a good example. Incomprehensibly, it's a good game despite boring level design, a story that takes almost the entire runtime of the game to get going and gameplay that feels like diet Nioh, despite some pretty compelling class design.

I love risk-taking Square. They're my favorite.
    A review literally calls it incomprehensible lol
One of his final closing lines is VERY leading in relation to certain characters, I honestly think you're better off not watching it again if you didn't catch it. Also there's footage of one of the major bosses.
Don’t worry, that’s not the biggest spoiler imo. 
There’s a big one that’s right in front of your eyes, even in the demo. Not going to say anything more. 
Sorry to hear. I hope you still buy the game and have a great experience. Unfortunately while details of the ending may have been ruined for you....there is still 50-80 hours of excitement to lead up to that.

As for Gamespot....its par for the course for them. Its almost as if its part of their review methodology to give plot specific in their reviews going all the way back to some spoilers I read in a Mass Effect 2 review.

At least they should be considerate and give a warning before they say what they need to say.
Yeah its a complete c\*nt move by them. Spoilerful reviews are fine but NOT before the game is even released, it shouldn't even be an option, even if they put a disclaimer in front.
Some of these older games have less reviews but yea 93 is bonkers. For reference games like Bloodborne have a 91, God of war Ragnarok has 94, Halo 3 has 94, as does original MW and bioshock. I use those as examples of the company rebirth is in now in terms of review scores. Very cool to see
you're not wrong, it was all 10s and high 90s in magazines when it released.(UK) Such was it's impact.
What a wait it’s been!
You genius
Tbh even with the sports bra they look very big.

I think too many chronically online people fail to realize that real women who have breasts like Tifa's are in fact considered very, very well endowed, lol. 

The whole nerf narrative was always silly.
Lmao
Weapon upgrading is very different. Weapon skill tree's are gone. Instead, each weapon has different strengths and weaknesses, and those kinda stay that way through the whole game. One new aspect though, are weapons level from using them, and each time a weapon "levels", you unlock a new passive skill that character can equip regardless of the weapon in there hand.

I finished the game with Buster Sword in hand.
    Do you get more materia slots though or does the number stay the same for each upgrade?
This game has more than its fair share of tough big bosses to hunt down.
IT'S SO ADDICTING. Its both a blessing and a curse.
I'd say if you breezed through it and ignored everything else, probably 40 hours if I had to guess. It's hard for me to discern because I did a lot of exploration and secret stuff.
There are some chapters where you have access to a bunch of the open world locations and you can freely explore them. It doesn't have the same dynamic stumbling upon things such as Elden Ring, but the open world quests and activities often build toward something larger and more connected, and the rewards are always worth it.
    Ok that's good enough for me. The heavy chapter based replay factor of the first game put me off replaying to find missed collectibles so I was hoping they'd steer from that design.  

Can't wait to get in there next week!  

EDIT: I internally call it the "stumble upon factor" but since I have not used it in public I figured no one knows what I mean, but yeah Elden Ring is S tier Stumble Upon Factor, SUF.
About the same if I had to wager. It was never something where I would complain about it as the scale and some of the later moments are so impressive.
SOme of that is me trying to do everything, but I'm also documenting it for work, taking videos etc. I could have done just about everything by the 100 hour mark if that was my sole focus. I've been taking in the view a bit ya know, enjoying it.
There is. Often a mini-game will be part of the story, and then you are fre to replay it and chase for high scores. They also have a multitude of unlocks that are pretty damn good. I'm talking like, actual character weapons and stuff you can't get anywhere else.
Yes, but the full game has more to see and do in each open world, and the demo has none of the larger story beats some of these side activities lead to down the road.
I'm not sure if I will sleep tonight either as the game will be playable at midnight in the UK...
Its not going to drop much it already has over 77 reviews.

XVI already dropped below 90 by that point.
It’s now at 93 with 113 reviews, so it’s basically impossible for it to fall much if at all anymore 
Exactly!!!! That’s like my favorite part of this remake trilogy lol I absolutely love Square’s reimagining of this story
    yeah, if they somehow can keep us talking about part 3 until it comes out, I think it’s a success.
17/20=85 i commented on jeuxactu youtube channel but they deleted my comment.
    They replied to someone and they said that their score is 17, but they actually changed it on their website to 16. Wow this is shitty move...
YESSS!

Sorry I haven't logged on there for a day or two, kinda took a step away and went outside :D 

Don't know if I can do an AMA now as the sub is on lockdown, might just write a comment on the endgame discussion thread or something and people can post under there.
Exactly. Not to mention this game covers the parts where I became a true FF fan so if one game had to break it I wanted it to be this one
Good work! Thx
True enough. I'm just hoping that a good percentage of that side content is quests with some engaging side stories and character moments. I could do without the open world waymark hunting sort of thing, but if that's in addition on top of the more interesting stuff then it's ok (and optional), and if the world is good enough then more reason to explore it is a positive.
Not for story alone. IGN has another article detailing the game time of 5 different employees. The fastest went through at 33 hours focusing on just the main story. The longest employee took over 97 hours.
FightinCowboy (a popular Let's Play Youtuber) said you could probably get through it in about 40 hours if you done nothing but the main story progression.

I can see this having quite a diverse playtime from 50-120 hours as very few people will hightail the main story and do nothing else.
Didn't watch the IGN review, but all the other reviews put the main story at 35-45 hours if you ignore all side content. Close to 100 hours if you do all side content.
Nojima you legend.
    Endo (battle director) also a legend
        The biggest legend from my perspective, this battle system is straight fire. 

One of the best in gaming, for my money.
        He's the real MVP!
Add Hamauzu and Suzuki too, their takes on Nobuo's work and their original compositions are a crucial part of this whole project!
    Yeah, even through Square Enix's struggles, there have been incredibly talented composers all over the company.  The soundtracks never disappoint.
That's the best negative I've ever heard, sign me up.

Man I'm so hyped for this.
This legitimately made me laugh when I read it.  I can't believe someone's that stupid to put a statement like that on the record.
    In fairness he gave the game an extremely high score but that was the issue he seemed to hammer on the most lol like the stuff is optional so he didn’t have to waste hours upon hours doing it
Some of these complaints are ridiculous.

Imagine saying that the side-content is so good that you get distracted from the main narrative and perceiving that a negative.  Just don't do the side-content then.
When the first demo was released, were people happy and satisfied? Nope, everyone either 1) was immediately disappointed they still had to wait for release; or 2) complaining about the graphics

I mean, whatever criticism you have is fair, but it seemed like NOBODY was content after playing it for one reason or another
It is just sad, man. Seriously. I am blown away they finally, after all these years of let downs have managed to revitalize the FF brand. 16, albeit not perfect, was a step in the right direction and it seems Rebirth is solidifying SE mission to bring glory back to Final Fantasy. Do these people not remember 15? Do they not remember the disaster that was 13? I am elated right now.
Yeah, it's weird.

It feels like they're either over-scoring the game based on the criticism they're dishing out, or they're holding the VII series and reputation to such a ridiculously high standard that anything but perfect scores will result in a fair bit of criticism.
    Eh, I don't think that's totally the case. It's just more that those blemishes exist, but don't make the product a lesser product as a result. ACG made that clear in his review, most of the major issues he felt were on the technical end. Side content has been getting a lot of praise, story is as well with the only major blemish being some of the pacing, and the ending being divisive (with even some loving it like Gene Park,) and the world itself is getting tons of love. 

I wouldn't think too hard about it. Blemishes exist in every product, even some of the highest rated ever. Whether or not they hurt the product as a whole is another topic, and going off these reviews, it doesn't seem like they do.
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

It's a fictional fantasy world, they can populate it with whatever the fuck they want.
Thanks for locking the sub down BTW! I was getting nervous about spoilers with copies out in the wild now. I think you guys are taking the right approach with the chapter discussion threads.

I actually am fairly purist about this in the sense that I expect it to be basically 90% faithful. Which it might be? I honestly can’t tell. 

Uh idk if this borders on spoilers because it’s kind of just my theory but just in case >! If my theory is correct, it will end up being faithful but over a longer story arc to the overall original themes. !<
    GamesRadar confirmed it was basically like Remake in their review.  90% faithful to the OG with some deviations.
    I've seen a bunch of reviews say that it's very faithful up until the very end.  It's just the final couple chapters that diverge, same as Remake.

Also your theory is very likely to be true based on developer comments.
I've seen people say they're ruining what the OG game was, but I think if anyone knows the intent/spirit of OG it's the people who actually made the game in the first place lol
*flips hair*
Iirc, the starting level is around 20.
I’m pretty sure you can with the disc version, there has never been a case where it was “locked” before release, at least from my experience!
    Which store? I live in London too!
Well I’m only 23 hours into the game which isn’t very much. I’ve been 100% every region before moving on and I’m just now about to leave the 2nd region. So far I have 3 weapons with Aerith and I think only two for all my other party members. I will say there are a lot of skills now that aren’t tied to weapons
2 new reviews 95 and 90 then.
Exactly the same as Remake then
Agreed. All the ending for part 2 really needs to do is keep people engaged for part 3. The ending of that game is the one that could potentially make or break the entire trilogy
whats funny is that its ironically more fanboy-like to get mad and whine about it anytime someone critiques something
Thanks for the Easy Allies suggestion. As if I wasn't already extremely hyped lol
Square is at its finest when it's busy taking risks. Stranger of Paradise is a good example. Incomprehensibly, it's a good game despite boring level design, a story that takes almost the entire runtime of the game to get going and gameplay that feels like diet Nioh, despite some pretty compelling class design.

I love risk-taking Square. They're my favorite.
A review literally calls it incomprehensible lol
Do you get more materia slots though or does the number stay the same for each upgrade?
Ok that's good enough for me. The heavy chapter based replay factor of the first game put me off replaying to find missed collectibles so I was hoping they'd steer from that design.  

Can't wait to get in there next week!  

EDIT: I internally call it the "stumble upon factor" but since I have not used it in public I figured no one knows what I mean, but yeah Elden Ring is S tier Stumble Upon Factor, SUF.
yeah, if they somehow can keep us talking about part 3 until it comes out, I think it’s a success.
They replied to someone and they said that their score is 17, but they actually changed it on their website to 16. Wow this is shitty move...
Endo (battle director) also a legend
    The biggest legend from my perspective, this battle system is straight fire. 

One of the best in gaming, for my money.
    He's the real MVP!
Yeah, even through Square Enix's struggles, there have been incredibly talented composers all over the company.  The soundtracks never disappoint.
In fairness he gave the game an extremely high score but that was the issue he seemed to hammer on the most lol like the stuff is optional so he didn’t have to waste hours upon hours doing it
Eh, I don't think that's totally the case. It's just more that those blemishes exist, but don't make the product a lesser product as a result. ACG made that clear in his review, most of the major issues he felt were on the technical end. Side content has been getting a lot of praise, story is as well with the only major blemish being some of the pacing, and the ending being divisive (with even some loving it like Gene Park,) and the world itself is getting tons of love. 

I wouldn't think too hard about it. Blemishes exist in every product, even some of the highest rated ever. Whether or not they hurt the product as a whole is another topic, and going off these reviews, it doesn't seem like they do.
You’re welcome. Thanks for the positive feedback. Many have disagreed, but we feel it’s the right thing to do.
Yes added new 4 reviews and score decreased to 92.
Eurogamer Germany gave it 80. Also JeuxActu 80, gamersky 95 , Merlin 94

It can be back to 93 if it gets 100 for 3 more reviews or 95 for 4 more reviews
