[[Is this the worst mission in GTA historyü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è]]





honestly? i never hated this mission, it's a sleeper but i dont abhor it, at least its done relatively quickly. i think the only mission that i have disdain for its scouting the port
    You'll hate it if your controller drifting
        Don't remind me...
            Worse if your hands are greasy or sweaty. 

When I first played this mission, I was angry because my thumbs kept fucking slipping off the sticks. It became INFINITELY easier with the PS4 version because of the concave sticks
                I don't EVER hold my controller with greasy or sweaty hands. 

A quick isopropyl alcohol rubs fixes everything
                    Absolutely- I do this probably once a month as a relatively casual video game player. Quite possibly a dash of OCD but it‚Äôs amazing how much better and calmer I feel playing after a fresh shower, hands washed, and controller cloroxed
                        Same , I even have a silicone cover for my controller to prevent scratches and for better grip.
                If your hands are greasy then just wash them first. Lol Sweat is another thing entirely tho.
                    Right!  Never use a controller with dirty ass hands.  Even my little kids don‚Äôt do that shit.
                Yeah, but if the controller is having stick drift, it's impossible. You said the DualShock4 is easier to use than the Xbox 360/DualShock3 controller, so it was hard, but not impossible.
                    I completed it on Xbox360 without any problems. The X360 controller is good for that mission even if there is no rubber on the joysticks remaining.
                nah WHAT 

are you playing in a sauna after eating a rotisserie chicken barehanded ?
                    Nah. The greasy part was just an example, but the sweat is because it gets hot in the northeast in summer
                Wash your hands
                    I do rather frequently, the grease was an example but the sweat was an issue from my extended gaming sessions.
        My controller would drift during this mission though. Just learn how to play with the drift. I know it‚Äôs hard. We all have played with controller drift. You could also just buy another controller. I went through 3 controllers on my Xbox one I had for 10 years.
        Try keeping the mouse 100% angled properly.
            bruh it‚Äôs easy
        Ah fuck off, I've completed this game 4 times I'm getting flashbacks now.
        Spunds loke a hardware issue not a game issue lol.
    Exactly. At least this mission had that cool drug trip scene at the end with Michael flying around the city. Scouting the port is just boring through and through.
        Is scouting the port the one where you mess with shipping containers?
            Oh shit that one is actually the worst
                Yes. It really is. I‚Äôve often given up a play through at that mission. üòÇ
                As someone who just replayed the game, the shipping container one is better bc dropping the containers actually requires some mental focus. In the yoga mission they literally have u just hold ur joystick in a certain direction for a few seconds. It‚Äôs kind-numbingly boring
    ‚Äúhow about i run that prick over in this thing‚Äù rent free in my head. everytime i replayed the game i would skip that mission hearing that fucking line three times over üò≠
        I would skip the mission by running the prick over in that thing 3 times.
            you and me both
    I don‚Äôt think you know what a sleeper is
        idk to me a sleeper is something thats just generally boring
            Most people would see it as shorthand for "sleeper hit", which refers to something that wasn't initially popular but gained more success as time went on
                Sleeper can also refer to a car that looks stock on the outside but is suped up under the hood. The term sleeper has several meanings and depending where you're from you'll be more inclined to assume a certain meaning. The point being people shouldn't through around vague terms like sleeper which just causes people to become confused and or waste their time having to ask what they meant...ect. I was thinking by sleeper mission he meant a mission that's seen as boring but in actuality is really good. Turns out he meant the opposite. Presicion beats being vague everytime when it comes to any form of communication.
                WTF? Never heard of the term "sleeper hit." You are projecting your life experience on everyone else and over applying what you think is common sense. Pro tip: "common sense" doesn't exist because not everyone has a common existence.
                    Pro tip: the word "common" doesn't imply "everyone" but extends over the human experience as a whole, which, despite drastic cultural differences, is fairly similar in its essence. 

Examples of common sense include drinking water when you're thirsty, acting civil towards others in your community, not touching a hot object, not jumping off a cliff expecting to live, using the bathroom when you need to, driving or walking on the designated road or path, etc. 

Common sense does exist, it is just far simpler concept than you make it out to be. 

Also, "sleeper" is a fairly common term, but knowledge of it is not an example of "common sense" (nor do i see where anyone said it was).
            No, that isn't the usage of the term. 

A sleeper is something that at face value is assumed to be boring uninteresting and unremarkable. But turns out to have been really good. 

A sleeper is either hiding its greatness. Or is improperly presenting itself. Like a hit movie with an awful name. Or a nissan altima with a heavy duty diesel engine in it.
                my bad
    Not going to lie, maybe I have a bit of the tism but I find that mission quite fun and unique ‚Äî¬†it's not just shooting people, collecting an objective and driving to a destination. Heavy machinery is cool
        Maybe ppl don't like the fact that infiltrating and casing a joint is a lengthy and tedious process IRL
            i think scouting the port (and the merryweather heist storyline in general) is fun on a first playthrough, but for me personally, on repeat playthroughs it feels like a chore.
        Same homie. Heavy machinery speaks to me on a primal level. I wish somebody told me about these occupations in high school.
    Honestly, I don‚Äôt mind both of these missions as much.

If you‚Äôre talking about the submarine one (as the ‚Äúscouting one‚Äù), yeah, I hated going super slow, I definitely didn‚Äôt like that one. If it was the one when Trevor is operating the machines, it was okay.

I just don‚Äôt like being locked as Trevor in ‚ÄúAct 2‚Äù, even though some of his missions were badass.

The missions that I did hate were the preparations of the heists, they could have made them so much more compelling. Also the drug trip ones, I didn‚Äôt like it as well.
    i had 0 issue with it, i don‚Äôt see why everyone hates it
    What the fuck? People having greasy hands or stick drift because they're bad owners doesn't make the mission shitty. üòÇ this thread is something else.
Any red baron mission is worst then this
    The sanandreas red baron had me fuming as a 12 yearold
        SA had done ridiculously challenging/frustrating missions at the time.
    ‚ÄúNooooooo oh oh ohhh‚Äù in David Cross voice
        Curse you, Berkley. Curse youuuuuuu!
    The racing mission in vice city where you had to beat your fucking driver in a race in order to get him to drive for you.
    I dont mind Zero missions tho
        I absolutely hate Zero and his missions with every fiber in my body, i dont understand why CJ didn't just straight up killed Berkley the Bitch who would rather fight with RCs than just fight Zero's scrawny ass irl.
    Came here to say exactly this lol
    I enjoyed Zero's missions.

I didn't like Key To Her Heart as it is just a long tailing don't-get-caught mission. Your reward is then to date (or eliminate) the croupier. Then also Snail Trail where you follow the train from San Fiero to Los Santos in order to do another tailing mission behind a taxi. Sure, a misdion where you get to use the sniper rifle, but the reward for completing the mission is then being so far away from the next missions.
        I liked San Andreas all the way to the point where you had to take-over most of the gang territories for the final mission/s to unlock. It was just so boring and some of those spots never had any gang members
            Yea that was very tedious to say the least, most of the time I would end up roaming around just to find the 3rd gang member to trigger gang war.

And we dont even end up earning alot of money back at the safe house.
    I commented this as well. Historically the worst GTA mission.
    Fuck I hated those missions 

I first played GTA San Andreas when I was 7, but I didn‚Äôt beat it until I was 15 because I hated those missions so much
    Especially the old version where gliding the plane still used fuel. Set the game down as a teenager and never picked it back up again because of the final one.
That's not even the worst mission in GTA 5. This guy forgot about the port mission and the excitement of loading crates?
    Nah, from someone who works in logistics, Trevor‚Äôs demeanor that entire mission is hilarious
        Thank fuck I‚Äôm high as a kite
            In transport, you‚Äôre either a Trevor or a Floyd. There is no In between
                HOW ABOUT I RUN THAT PRICK OVER IN THIS THING
                    [How about I run that prick over in this thing.](https://youtu.be/ewSu4Jd9SbA?si=S0oYKBtkCmcvQOnE)
                    *HOW BOAT I RUN THAT PRICK OVER IN THIS THING
                This is so accurate lmfao
                I know who I would be.
            It would be even better if there was an option when playing as Trevor to do some sort of drug that gives you some kind of in game intoxication handicap and then attempt the mission. Psychedelic visual effects, drunken effects, stimulant effects, etc. paired with radio station music from your cellphone that would make the box loading game more realistic and immersive.
            sir, you should not be operating this vehicle under the influence
                I‚ÄôLL operate YOU, under the influence
            Any time I‚Äôm high af I actually say that lmfao cuz of Trevor
            Sir, you shouldn't be operating this vehicle under the influence!
        Yeah Trevor running off while Floyd gets beat down by Merryweather was pretty funny, but then Wade was a damn tragedy lol
            It just kept coming, and coming
    honestly, the whole merryweather heist in general just pisses me off. you get NOTHING for it, and it‚Äôs one of the most convoluted heists in the fucking game
        Yeah, it felt a lot like the diamonds from gta4. Like there is more there that would probably make sense in a SP DLC that never came.
            exactly! when i first played through the story mode i was thinking they pulled out all the stops, but then i heard about all the cut content (like the raid on madrazo‚Äôs house which would have been EPIC) and i just felt really sad :‚Äô/
                It's really shitty they cut all single player dlc cuz the GTA5 heist stuff is actually really well done and I liked planning then executing the heists. Had so much potential for a huge variety of heists.

Then they slammed it all into GTA: "How much money can we squeeze from whales?"
        I‚Äôm glad someone said it
        Another is the Merriweather train, I fell of so many times when trevor uses motorcycle to get to front of the train. I kinda like the results, that said better than CJ. nice reference to SA
    The crate thing is bar-able for me but this is mission is just annoying
    I actually liked that mission.
    That's Mafia II dude /s
        Damn you reminded me. I love Mafia 2. One of the best storylines in gaming imo
        Well, in Mafia 2 you only have to move a couple of crates
            And that was cool as hell, really immersive imo. You want to go commit crimes instead, but thats the point: so does your character. Its the boredom > crime pipeline
            I like that the more boxes you move, Vito becomes progressively more and more pissy
        The dock mission. I loaded about 7 of them, I was like wait this is mafia game so I left lol
            Everyone downvoting you can fuck off lol honestly thinking about this mission makes me want to replay mafia 2 üòÇ I also just watched ‚Äúthe offer‚Äù on paramount‚Äôs streaming site so I‚Äôm in that zone. I played mafia 2 (the remastered DE version) for the first time in 2020 and was fully hooked from start to finish. Played through it in about 3 days during the pandemic lol. Also proof that games don‚Äôt need to be elongated / filled with fluff to be masterpieces
            I kept loading them until the game wouldn‚Äôt let me anymore.  With Vito whining the whole time
    I hate using the submarine since it doesnt even have a  radio.
        I think the controls on the sub suck
            It also is used in one of the most shallow parts of the game world. Everytime I went below the surface by even an inch it felt like I was scraping bottom. Also played the original release and there was nothing so depressing as driving a sub through the soupy water of the LS docks.
        That trip over to where Floyd picks you up takes *forever* in that silent sub.
    I weirdly enjoyed that mission, and right after I always just hauled ass to the next part because the truck felt great to drive. 

Can‚Äôt explain why, really.
    The dialogue is awesome on that mission
    And the helicopter tracking mission with Trevor and Franklin where you have to use the sonar camera shit to find the guy in the parking garage.
    I liked driving that loader, wasn't too long
    I hated that one the second time around and realised why I had no memory of it at all from the first time. I just ended up blocking out all recollection of having done it. It must have glitched when I tried to finish it because I was stuck on one of the last parts for ages trying to get the damn things to register as being placed. Wasn't sure if physics shifted it out of wack. That and it repeated more than once rather than try to mix things up with various other kinds of tasks. Just awful.

What's so bad about the yoga? You have to hold some button prompts for a few seconds to some comically uninteresting visuals. Honestly if this was the worst mission then they didn't really do anything bad at all.
    What's the mission where you get a text of a tiny portion of the map and have to find it
    And getting yelled at by Trevor for having no idea what the f to do
    That mission is fine, save for when i'd accidentally slip off of the ladder and fall to my death!
    Horrible take.
        How? Have you even played the mission?
Ned Luke thought so too, his commentary on recording this scene is hilarious
    Is there a clip of this?
        I watched a video of him talking about it either on his channel or in an interview recently, but can‚Äôt remember exactly which video. He just said it was a pain in the ass to record because they had to capture all the mess ups during every single pose as well as all the successful attempts. He said he wasn‚Äôt super limber and the yoga instructor was actually getting frustrated with him. Said it took them about 8hrs of doing yoga to capture it all and he was very sore afterwards.

Edit: nevermind, I found the clip. [Here is the full video](https://www.youtube.com/live/eZQVnK6eS5w?si=T3qUJFM4TppnvnJ8). His commentary on this scene starts at around the 8 minute mark
            "Maybe he didn't have balls because he was a Yoga Instructor"

Fucking dying.
            the fact that his wife was doing yoga irl too wtf
            omg this is gold. ned is so funny he is literally michael üòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠
        [Here you go!](https://www.youtube.com/live/eZQVnK6eS5w?si=T3qUJFM4TppnvnJ8) It starts at about the 8 minute mark.
            Thanks. I ended up watching that for about 50 minutes.
Funny how his real wife was getting mad at him while trying to do yoga.
                Yeah, Ned is pretty funny and I love hearing the behind the scenes commentary from him directly. I want to watch his whole GTAV playthrough, but that‚Äôs a lot of hours!
                    Badass how he actually played the game he stars in. Getting a role in a Rockstar game should come with a contractual obligation to play through the game one time. Maybe make exceptions for people (over 80, blind, no hands, etc.)  

These guys who go around doing interviews about a game they've never played are a real downer and starring in any Rockstar game is a lifetime position - you'll literally be interviewed and asked about it until you die.
            hero
        He has a whole YouTube channel he‚Äôs going through a mission per day he streams is live dude
            There must have been some point when playing the game where it clicked and he had the profound realization that *GTA V is an amazing game*. He'd heard it from everyone and he knew how badass Rockstar is but on some level he must have had some doubts until he actually got immersed in it.
Y'all forget this is the mission where you fly high over Los Santos, literally one of the most memorable missions of the series.

Slow and annoying in the beggining? Surely. Still the mission I replayed the most just to get high on horse tranquilizers and vibe to the music.
    > I replayed the most just to get high on horse tranquilizers and vibe to the music.

My man getting dropping into a K-hole for some GTA V. Respect.
    100% - epic and iconic mission in the series!
    One of my favorite parts of the whole game. This is a brain dead take like saying the train mission in San Andreas is impossible
    It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down. I had the radio on, I was drivin'
        Runnin down a dream
Tonya shit kills me
    The missions themselves are not bad to me, it is just hearing her annoying ass ramble about nothing.
        His loss, your gain suga
    Stuff of nightmares
    This is the correct answer imo. I found Tanya to be a completely forgettable character and the missions are so slow/repetitive/uninteresting. Only value I think this adds is showing Franklin being from the hood (helping out his buddy who was two drugged up to show up for work) and explaining some incredibly lackluster background on franklin‚Äôs relationship to his community
        It sucks you can‚Äôt kill her
            the duality of gta players
            Lmao it would be funny AF if you had to ice Tonya in the death wish mission
Nah man, scouting the port is the worst. If I wanted to move around crates, I‚Äôd ask my boss if his brother was hiring.
    if your brothers a longshoreman you should. Those jobs are absolute money in the bank
        That may be, but I‚Äôm on a maintenance contract and I have so much downtime here, I‚Äôm practically getting paid just to chill. Easy money.
I found this mission hilarious, so that alone is enough to keep it from being the worst.
In GTA history? Nah, that‚Äôs gonna be the RC helicopter one from Vice City
    Gave my buddy lunchables to beat it for me.
        Multiple lunchables?! That man hustled you! Haha
            Calm down. I hated the turkey ones, and he only got two. 
 So, who really got fleeced here?
        r/nocontext
            Lmao lil bit of the ol school yard nasty tugs.
    Yup. Fuck that mission.
    Yea I never even passed it lol
        This was a mission you handed over to the big bro to get done
            I am the  big bro, I hated it too.
                As a big bro, I beat it once and then beat it again when my sis was playing it. Definitely the most hated mission in GTA history.
    Literally was gonna say this one lol, for sure the worst
    From what I remember that was easy
    ![gif](giphy|2hf0ufsIWT2lkXam5w|downsized)
    That and throwing that damn grenade through the window
    Never forget watching my buddy try to beat this one for like a month.

Don't think either one of us ever did.

Fuck that mission.
    THIS. I just finished that yesterday. I would rather die than do it again
    Lol, this mission is triggering what? A decade later?
it was honestly fine there wasnt really a mission that was harder then others, this is tho the one mission that doesnt have instant action packed buzzword soup murder boner inducing car chase and robbing scene so i can see why that guy thinks so.
    That is a glorious sentence. Bravo.
I think the only mission I actually didn't like was Tonya's first trucking mission, I get it, but it's the only one that makes me go, ....ok
    Especially at start, by that time u are shooting people and that mission doesn't really fit, it should been the first mission before Lamar and frank take the doc cars
Hell, no.  It was funny.  Missions like that add spice and variety.
    yea i love the missions that are ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô in rockstar games
Thankfully after that, we'll have the drug trip
Majority of the missions involving Michael‚Äôs family are excruciating but at least this one isn‚Äôt as long as Scouting The Port
    Scouting the Port is atrocious
        Imagine if you had to do it with Michael‚Äôs family üò∞
            Amanda, Tracey, and Jimmy all complaining whilst you slowly move crates
    Idk, Father/Son and Daddy's little girl are some of my favorite missions
i found clicking both analog sticks combined with the instruction animations very satisfying
Not really. I like yoga.
ehhh, I liked the satire
The worst missions are running or bicycle riding when you just need to press the blue X (A) again and again and hope the controller passes some more time.
    Biking in GTA San Andreas (PS2) might actually be more fun than biking in GTA V.
Na that mission in San Andreas where u gotta drive the rc plane around is still pretty trash
Nah it's not even the worse in GTAV. It's not great but it has some of the funniest dialogue in the game.

"Nama-go fuck yourself"

"Bounce? We're bouncing now? Jesus fuckin Christ"
I always hated the driving school and flight school missions in san andreas way more than this. Part of the driving school one, which is optional, is flipping your car in a barrel roll over 2 other cars and if you don't land exactly perfectly you don't pass, and i never could. Not through lack of trying either ive literally spent like an hour at a time trying to barrel roll the car just right and never have. Ive beaten san andreas multiple times, never could barrel roll the car.
Speak for urself buddy run the San Andreas rc mission
    I think they wanted to make them unique and ended up being boring
        True.
    At least you can complete the rest of the story without completing all of the Zero missions.
Not even close lol that goddamn remote control toy plane for zero in San Andreas is the worst.
Nah, the worst mission in the whole saga, I'd say Snail Trail (GTA San Andreas), boring, exaggeratedly difficult, and the worst part: No reward.
    That mission was weird. It didn‚Äôt build on anything, it didn‚Äôt lead into anything. It just wasted time and lord help you if you somehow fail after getting all the way to LS
        That mission is so aggravating because if you fail it‚Äôs always in the dumbest way, especially with that ‚ÄúSpook-O-Meter‚Äù
I actually found it funny because Michael would never do something so out of character and yet he forced himself to do it. I laughed thoroughly through this mission. After that, during mid game, I went up to a mountain and did it once more at sunset, and I laughed again because it felt like Michael secretly trying it out on the top of a mountain. True game moments.
Amanda is thicc
    Ikr. She‚Äôs a whole mess of crazy but she kinda bad tho
2nd worst is port mission
Paparazzi Missionü´•
No the dancing mission on San Andreas. You just had to be there üòµ‚Äçüí´
After 10 years this is the first I‚Äôve ever heard there was issue with this mission. I thought it was fine and part of the story/world building. People will legit find anything to winge about online I swear.
## My answer:

It might be the kind of mission that you only do once like the toy plane from Zero in GTA SA.
    #Thanks for sharing your answer
That one. Any chopper mission  like for the heist or flying. Or as trevor trying to land the wmd or It took couple tries but in end it easy by annoying. I think the most annoying mission is Floyd yard mission, rhe first one where he accompanies trevor. Online the one I had but I got the hang out was the mission in airport that u had to fly, the one u complete with 6 players. The flying part I didn't like
I think people just love to hate on this mission. It‚Äôs not even hard. Zero‚Äôs missions in GTA SA wasn‚Äôt that hard. The RC plane or helicopter missions in vice city weren‚Äôt hard either. Some of Woozies in SA have been difficult mainly because I get the cops on me and they always make it hard because I‚Äôll have 3 stars. Start the mission and they‚Äôre still on me. I don‚Äôt play on hard. I play on ‚ÄúWanted‚Äù
Dayum Amanda lookin thick
I hated san andreas missions that had this kind of shit.
The mission on San Andreas with the toy airplane is the worst and the city slick mission
Not worst but the most boring mission in GTA 5
I literally put the controller down and went outside for the first time in months.
    Similar. Every time I was forced to do yoga I got pissed off and thought how I could be doing actual yoga and so I did.
Nope I actually like it tbh. Shows Amanda‚Äôs wrong about Michael lmao
Idk why people hate this mission, its piss easy.
The tow truck missions are the worst. I wish there was a way to run over Tonya over and over again to get her to shut up.
    Jesus
Me with stick drift on controller with ps4 ¬∞~¬∞
Main story mission?  Yeah.

Speaking of Michael missions at his house, I had a lot of trouble getting past that one with the PMC thugs.  They'd take Amanda hostage, and you know how you have to make a headshot on the enemy to save Amanda?  I kept using a shotgun and it'd take off both their heads and I'd have to restart.

Mistakes were made.

>!Not by me though.  I knew exactly what I was doing.  I'd been waiting for a chance to kill that bitch all game.!<
those micro plane missions in san andreas üíÄüò≠
The point of the mission is to annoy you.
Demolition Man in Vice City was pretty dreadful
It‚Äôs not even bad, am I missing something to make me hate it? It‚Äôs quick and easy
I hated that ‚ÄúDemolition Man‚Äù mission on Vice City. Really any mission with that damn RC plane üòÇ
Nama-go f*** yourself. Anything with Fabian in V is hilarious
Demolition Man (the Vice city RC helicopter mission) is the worst GTA mission imo.
No? Why?
That fucking RC plane for the lawyer(? hacker?) in Vice City
No. Pretty sure this one has a trip scene and it's really fun.
Gta vice city helicopter mission üóø
The silly man forgets to breathe...
This is my favorite mission. You‚Äôll can‚Äôt go more than five minutes without killing something.
Not in history, but it‚Äôs up there as a boring ass mission
Yoga, supply lines, og loc and new model army + flight school give me anger issues
The yoga mission makes me appreciate the "skip that shit" feature.
    Do it to all missions and then you can cheat and complete the game in an hour
I love this mission because it includes the drug trip!
As a PC player, I never hated this. Worst u mean the being insufferable due to difficulty or just utter boredom?
You honestly have to have 2 iq to think this mission is hard
    Worst doesn't mean hard
this mission is nothing. its easy, pointless, and boring. Supply Lines... from San Andreas can go fuck itself though.
I think I said this in a different post, but the gameplay of the mission doesn't bother me, but it's the way Michael is treated that bothers me. Amanda cheats on him and she acts like the victim?? Then Michael gets fucking drugged by Jimmy. I swear for how much ppl call Michael evil, he's a Saint. How tf could Michael even forgive any of them?? (I mean, Tracey wasn't too bad, she was just sorta roped in with Amanda and Jimmy.) But why tf would Michael forgive Amanda and Jimmy after that??
That or the dock one
I'm still baffled as to why Rockstar included this mission in the game. Like who the hell thought that we would actually enjoy yoga lol
Definitely the worst. It‚Äôs so boring, the only reason I play it is the fun sky fall at the end. Tip: You play that part while stoned and/or drunk it‚Äôs a whole new experience
Yes, and the worst activity.

They get rid of bowling and replace it with yoga????
Scouting the Port
Ya
Hell no the Vice city drone with the fucking bombs on the construction site fuck that mission
That was the moment when I realized Rockstar doesn't know how to use the sandbox they invented anymore.
GTA 5 might be the worst story mode in GTA history.

Port mission or the one where jimmy gives drugs are the worst
Especially when your analog is bogey
I love doing yoga Michael style
Truthfully.

Still baffled that this made it in, but not any staples like vigilante, paramedic, etc.
I remember that my michael caught fire in that mission.
i just did the wander the senora desert for 20 mins mission  


fk epsilonists
The port mission is worse. It was fun the first time and to RP being a construction worker, but every other time ive played it, its kinda annoying.

The the yoga stuff isnt even that bad. Its quick.
Yes
I remember coming back many years later to replay the story and when I got here I turned my Xbox off and haven‚Äôt played gta since
Did someone say yoga?
The mission itself is pretty meh. But the cut scene for this is one of my favorites in gta 5
If you have a broken controller you'll hate this mission even more. I remember this once with a PS4 controller that was drifting and had to retry more than a dozen times.
Vice city RC helicopter  mission.
I hate moving stuff at the docks, and I hate the submarine mission
The mission with Beverly where you secretly film a sex scene. It would *maybe* be just slightly bearable if not for the fact that he's so goddamn irritating.

Also, everything with Mary Anne, for the same reason.
I just played this the other day. Def had me thinking Wtf I was doing
There‚Äôs a couple missions in that game that are awful
Supply Lines.
Cargo crane
So dumb
theres a lot of stinkers in gta4
i don‚Äôt know about THIS one specifically, sure it‚Äôs completely worthless aside from the story elements, but there were worse missions that didn‚Äôt even contribute to the story that much.

also, somewhat off-topic, but can we just acknowledge that the merryweather heist is a complete waste of everyone‚Äôs fucking time? thank you
How is that gta 6 info
Yes it is especially if you have messed up anoglog sticks
it took me ten minutes before realizing I had to press an additional button to breath
Nothing is worse than the fucking train in San Andreas
Very tough on console, easy on keyboard. I completed on both.
Nah the one with Trevor later at the shipyard is worse. Lasts way longer
Yes! Total waste of time and energy! I play this game either to be a gangster or a cop( i use mods)! What the Fucking do i have to do with yoga?
BUT FOR REAL-
once  the sweat clears your good lol. nothing like tonya or the, CRANE!
It‚Äôs important plotwise iirc and lets be honest its not physically uncomfortable to do as the torture mission is. Thats just me tho
GTA5 really is just shitty when it comes to the story. The Franklin missions are cool. Some of the Michael missions are cool. But I dread the Trevor missions before he reunites with Michael again. I also really despise Michael and his family. I hope they never do 3 protagonists again. The only reason I'm kinda okay with the two in GTA6 is because it's Bonnie and Clyde type. But I really don't like multiple protagonists.
tell me you never played Scouting The Port without telling me you haven‚Äôt
I like it because it serves the purpose of widening the overall scope of missions a GTA game has. For a game that tries to be the game where you can do anything, I felt it made sense to have a very wide and sometimes odd range of stuff to do
Nah it‚Äôs the submarine part of the shipping boat heist
I find did somebody say yoga mission hailarious
Hell nah I think the one where we have to work at the docks and move crates around is obnoxious and boring.
I hate this mission
I don‚Äôt know man I didn‚Äôt think it was too bad
I just restarted gta 5 on the ps5. Just finished getting Jimothys dumb ass off the Yatch . So far it's good.
Did somebody say yoga?
I hate this mission more because his wife is obviously cheating with the yoga instructor than the actual mission itself.
No way the submarine is the worst thing ever put into this game.
I actually thought it was amusing lol.
San Andreas RC Helicopter mission from David Cross by a mile.
Prob is the worst one in 5. But as a kid, trying to keep up with that train in SA. Was torture for some reason. Oh and the damn mini airplane ones too.
This mission, 90% of the heist setups, and the dock mission are the worst I've ever played
I really like this mission, I think scoping the port is worse then this one
This mission is boring the 1st half but the acid scene in the 2nd half saves it
It's supposed to suck by design. It places you in Michael's shoes as just like him, you also think his wife's yoga is stupid. I'd even go ahead and say the mission is quite immersive
I liked it. It was relaxing.
‚ÄúLife‚Äôs a beach ‚Äú from gta San Andreas for me the song was awesome but I took me forever to beat that mission . Maybe I just sucked at it but it was a bitch and made me angry lol
I don‚Äôt get the hate for his one; it‚Äôs super easy lmao.
This and the crane mission are painfully boring with no replay value gameplay wise. GTA has a-lot of mid missions buried in between hype moments and iconic missions but this is like a F tier mission all things considered
Honestly it's one of my favorites but mostly because of the acid trip.
I didn‚Äôt have a problem..
Trying to play thru the game now to finish the story and this mission pissed me off
It must be a skill issue lmao
Worse than the vice city helicopter? I don‚Äôt think so.
It's funny when you get the moves wrong.
i always just failed this part of the mission to skip it
Most of the film studio missions were pretty boring.
in gta history is just a dramatic take
Is this separate from when you go to pick up your son and he drugs your drink? I seem to remember them being back to back or at least part of the same mission. Because the part when you're falling out of the UFO was just really awesome visually.
Sexy time from TBOGT
This may not be the most action driven and explosive mission, but it helps build up the story (and consequently the comic side) of the game. Now the port mission... Could've been just a cutscene
Run around in circles for the cult
No it‚Äôs the best
Yes!! Marginally worse than the radio controlled Top Fun planes!!
Construction mission enters the chat
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
At least you can skip the yoga part
History would be the rc plane one in San Andreas
touch grass and do actual yoga
To me this is the easiest mission in the game
I kept failing at this ü§£
not even close üòÇ this shit takes 5 minutes then it‚Äôs over. Y‚Äôall remember the rc helicopter from vice city or the plane you do for Z in san andreas?
Nah, this mission is easy af. Plus the scene where Michael Has a drug trip and falls from sky is the best scene in the game.
Easily the worst mission is the farm mission in San Andreas. Fuuuuuuck that drive.
Clearly never did Zero
I would agree with that one
Joe‚Äôs the worst twitter user in history‚Ä¶
Agreed. I also hate the mission where you have to torture that guy. The shock value wears off on the second playthrough and it's just long and tedious. It doesn't help that I know who the target is at the party, but I can't just kill him as soon as I take over as Michael.
Any RC mission are the worst change my mind
The docks mission with trevor is more annoying for me
This is very easy on PC with keyboard and mouse. Also fun. I sometimes do Yoga as free roam side activity. I like to RP the game.
Only thing I never learned till this day is how to play tenis.. not like I tried a lot of times as I do not like sports that include a ball, but it not really clear to me how to play it.
No
This is unironically my favorite mission in any GTA just due to the drug sequence at the end. The vibe with the music is just awesome.
Does hot coffee count
Some of you have clearly never had to shoot down attack model airplanes with David Cross repeating "My humiliation, is complete" over, and over, and over, and over again.
Having them as family made this game so shit to me as michael i wanted him to eliminate all of them especially the wife
Its annoying when you have a controller not registering the thumbstick motions properly and you gotta switch to your other controller
I might get hate but honestly I did like it, sometimes relaxing in game can be good














Meanwhile Sebastian could get a bullet in his head :)
Any part of that merry weather heist kinda sucked.  No reward at the end.
Ya I could agree
holy shit YES. nothing worthwhile is in this mission
*Supply Lines* would like a word.
Containers/crates beats this mission by a thousand miles.
History, no. But it is the worst one in GTA 5. The tow truck mission are next
I actually always liked this mission üòÇüòÇ
What's the deal with the monkeys? I've never figured that out. Did they escape the zoo or humane labs. Also why are they in a Alley behind the budget sho
Idk, Michael unsuccesfully trying yoga and relaxation, only to then be pwned by Jimmy, hallucinate aliens and fly over LS under the effects of horse tranquilizers, returning home and seeing that his family had left him feels like the peak of his pathos.
Nah. Saving Tracy‚Äôs dumbass from the porn boat is.
The mission where you have to walk for an hour for epsilon.
Fact
I actually liked this for the hilarious dialogue
Still better then recording that chick get fucked, or scoping the docks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Far from it.
Yes
HAHAHA go play GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas then you know how painfull everything is...
Maybe but idk what else would be the worst so probably. Even if it is it‚Äôs still hilarious
Still better than cyberpunk
Yup
Nope still the train one in San Andreas
This mission was boring, but my least favorite mission is the one where you have to torture that dude. I hated doing that and I wish I could skip it.
I wouldn‚Äôt  call it the worse, but it‚Äôs one of the most annoying in my opinion.
red baron missions (gta sa), tonya missions, flying school (gta sa), any mission with a helicopter in gta 5, catalina liquor store robbery, driving school (gta sa), the merryweather port missions are worse
Being forced to pilot the helicopter will always be the worse
Bro this mission is absolute garbage. I failed the mission because Micheal didn‚Äôt spread his legs enough
The worst mission is flying a lil toy plane around San fierro with a time limit, the plane was about as durable as an actual toy lol
If ever I wanted to skip a mission this was it.
Scouting the port was by far the worst one.
So bad it was good
Yes.
For me its a tie between Scouting the Port or Cleaning out the Bureau nothing happens at all
It definitely unlocked the most useful mini game ever
Ne worst in History is either the bomb helicopter at the construction side, or the train-motorcycle chase.
My vote is for the dockworker mission. Whatever the worst mission is, it's definitely in this game.
Why does everyone say it is hard, it is easy
yes i raged so hard at this so many times
It‚Äôs absolutely the train mission in San Andreas. That shit was so rough before the remaster and rereleases.
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN, CJ!

no contest
![gif](giphy|jQoGsy5BhvUQawtfdx|downsized)
This is the only mission in any game ive ever played that i failed many times and was required to use the skip mission button cause i couldnt pass it. I had a fucked up controller
The nerve agent raid simply because I can‚Äôt FUCKING start it
It‚Äôs up there, yeah
Vice City Helicopter
Has he played 3, VC, SA, VCS, TBOGT? Doesn't seem like it
Definitely not. The loading docks missions sucks absolute balls.
So fn wack, same brainless mini game three times in a game where you can drive or shoot something for more brainless gameplay. (I like my brain dead shit like everyone else but this shit makes me feel trapped the fact its not completely brain eead and have to focus on the last one for just a inevitable fail) and the weirdo at the end of the mission just makes it worse.
it was a pain with pc controls, but hey, at least i learned some yoga irl.
Nah the RC planes or the train missions in San Andreas were much worse.  The yoga mission is too short for it to be the worst mission.
Oh God yes
idk it did a good job of making me as annoyed as michael seemed so in terms of story telling its pretty solid
I just about gave up.
One of my sticks was busted when I hit this and it took FOREVER to get past it
I didn't have to attempt it 10+ times, so no, it's not the worst.
It's Worse With M&K
All of ya'll are over dramatic, it's nothing really. It's simple and easy
the zero mission with the toy plane is the worst gta mission
The tourture mission is by far the worst. I like the free falling part of that 'did somebody say yoga' mission..
Like why would they think this would be fun?
I actually don‚Äôt mind this mission. It‚Äôs not hard, it‚Äôs kinda relaxing and Michael loses his shit at the end‚Ä¶what‚Äôs not to love? There‚Äôs many missions I hate more.
I wonder if anyone actually played GTA 5 just to do Yoga only in that game.
Oh no, you had to stop the carnage for a few minutes and relax. How terrible. üòÇ
Mopping the floor in the FIB building was tedious and annoying. Almost as much as doing Ranch chores as Jim Milton in the beginning of the RDR2 epilogue.
Scouting the Port is worse. This one is slow to start, but the second half is slightly better/less bad. Scouting the Port is just a slog from start to finish.
    The only thing that saves this mission for me is dialogue. Legit, I find Trevor pretty funny on this one.
"All you had to do was follow the damn train!"
Worst mission in any game ever.
I still dislike the RC plane mission with the horrible controls
Any mission in this game that favored "realism" and simulation over having fun. Forced yoga, that stupid towing game, Chop's training, the mission where you buy a mask. Hunting just to take a pic. Michael's pointless therapy. That stupid fucking Marathon 3. Just tedious shit. I want to tell Rockstar it's okay to gloss over the boring stuff. I don't need to buy gas, have insurance, manually file the serial numbers off of my stolen goods, take heart meds, clean off the windshield when I hit someone or have a breathe button. You can abstract some of these things.
GET ON THE DAMN TRAIN CJ

Is the worst mission in gta. Makes me want to quit playing San Andreas every time
The torture mission is the worst for me.
The Merryweather heist was literally useless.
Scouting the port is worse
Yeah you‚Äôre right, there was no need to have this small mission in the first place. 

But this mission does lead up to Amanda and Michaels break up.
The only missions I hate are the one that involves driving aircrafts because I'm using a console.
The shipment crates are worse
Nah, it's the epsilon missions that truly suck ass.
Yes! Yes! And fcuking yes!!!!
It‚Äôs fine as a fun short mission. It is miles better than the fucking dockyard.
No lie i stopped playing after this. Never actually finished gta5
Y‚Äôall never played with an RC air plane and it shows.
The mini airplane ones on vice city and San Andreas by far
Horrible
Any of the remote controlled plane missions in san andreas
Nah the merryweather heist is probably the worst mission imo
At least people remember this one
No way.

 the rc plane mission in San Andreas has cost me multiple controllers.
lol chill out nerds, just play the game
No. The one with the crane and Trevor is the worst one imo
So I won't claim it's the worst but I HATED the Big Smoke train follow mission in San Andreas. My man can't shoot for shit, even if I get him right next to the train targets for long periods of time.
I hate the boat mission and the bike mission till reach the beach
I thought the minigame was a little fun. I've played worst missions before. Like that mission in gta 3 where you have to pick up multiple girls, god that was awful
So horrible.
My younger self hated SAs first rc plane mission. For whatever reason I was stuck on it for a week and half straight. Never really felt hate towards any other mission in all the series
bruh i had stick drift doing that mission
It was fine in theory, just way too long
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty lame.  And there‚Äôs another spot you can go do yoga at and a cougar will most likely kill you on the way there.  Also you don‚Äôt get anything for actually going out of your way to do the lame yoga.
I thought I was gonna see CJ and Big Smoke on a Dirtbike before some one said Yoga?
*Cough* Zero RC Missions *cough*
I always thought it was a funny ass poke at Nintendo and their wii fit
Best mission with the chaos mod. 
Griefer Jesus and Jealous jimmy shooting Micheal doing yoga is the best.
The yoga part is boring but the hallucination flying bit is so good, and I used to just fly around for ages just listening to the song.
When you‚Äôre in your late 40‚Äôs and doing this mission, you‚Äôre real body feels the pain. Lol
People who think  this is the worst have never tried to fly an RC plane across San Fiero
They need to being back the parade of Elvis Presleys, for kicks.
Easy, but waste of time
Facts I hate this one
FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN CJ!
No, not even close. Honestly, the cutscenes and Micheal‚Äôs drug trip make this mission a highlight for me.

Cleaning out the Bureau, Scouting the Port and all the Tonya mission are INFINITELY worse IMO.
I find the side mission with the submarine the most boring one. Only necessary for 100% completion but it sure challenges your mental stability if you're going for it...
You are joking right??? At the end of the mission is when you trip on acid, and get abducted by aliens and free fall over the city that‚Äôs my favorite GTA mission of all time
Does not stand a chance to the one where he goes on an acid trip
It's like less than 5 minutes, common
Better than the flying ones
Oh my fucking God I hate this missio
Admittedly, it took some trial and error to figure out how to do it with keyboard and mouse.
All we had to do was follow the damn train CJ.
The part where Michael fights with the yoga instructor and then he gets high because of Jimmy it saves the mission from being the worst . There are worse missions in the GTA franchise
This mission and Trevor's mission "Scouting the port" are the absolute worst
Absolutely. Just about everything that involved Michael and his family was bad.
S.A.M. would like to have a word with you
Did somebody say yoga?
Most boring definitely but the Zero RC plane in SA is way shittier and harder imo
There was no point to this mission and i hated every second
*the worst mission in GTA
Honestly I just intentionally failed it so I can move on.
It's not as bad as trying to find the beast. 

You eat all this peyote in specific order on specific days and then have to track that motherfucker down using sound?
Fr
Nah, the one with that helicopter drone thing was.

Edit

Just realised it was GTA5.to be fair, I've not played story mode for nearly 10 years, so I can't recall.
It took me fucking 10 minutes because my controller drifts
Submarine
It‚Äôs horrible
Easily
üíØ
Zoomers when there‚Äôs a mission that doesn‚Äôt involve shooting
This mission almost made me buy a new controller
Anyone who says that‚Äôs the worst mission hasn‚Äôt played the flying missions in San Andreas.
![gif](giphy|YUUiL599wlvzQVbNTH|downsized)
Honestly didn‚Äôt hate it. Though I did hate the yoga part at first (mainly cause my old 360 controller had mild drift that kept screwing the mission up). Now that I‚Äôm on Xbox One with a working controller I actually kinda find it ok. Also I love the trippy drug trip part in the second half of the mission. It‚Äôs fun.
This not even the worst mission in GTA V, that one crane thing with Floyd was a pain
The most annoying mission in gta history is when you had to get elizabeta coke on gta 4?
I thought it was fun. Not exciting, but lighthearted and chill

We‚Äôre talking the whole series? Nowhere near as bad as the Zero missions in SA‚Ä¶..
honestly the worst mission in GTA Is the Trevor one , when you have to infiltrate Merryweather
I‚Äôm replaying the campaign right now and dreading the moment this comes
i‚Äôd rather play this than scouting the port 100%
Nah , The worst ones is those lil toy helicopter üöÅ with a bomb stick on it .
This or the weed trip with the aliens and minigun
Naw, scouting the port/merryweather hiest for me.
Faxs bro that shit was so annoying
This mission was so funny and the Yoga part was piss easy
At least this one is quick, Scouting the Port is just as boring if not more so and takes longer
Scouting the port is my pick
Someone never did the RC missions.
that one trevor mission where you do logistics work for 20 mins was a pain every run through
I liked the second half of this mission. Really good song.
The mini plane flying missions in San Andreas were worse
Nah man, fuck that interrogation mission.
Everything involving Michael‚Äôs family was a painful chore and I LOVE GTA V.
I think it‚Äòs fine.
The Yoga is annoying but getting drugged by jimmy is incredible
You'll hate it if your controller drifting
    Don't remind me...
        Worse if your hands are greasy or sweaty. 

When I first played this mission, I was angry because my thumbs kept fucking slipping off the sticks. It became INFINITELY easier with the PS4 version because of the concave sticks
            I don't EVER hold my controller with greasy or sweaty hands. 

A quick isopropyl alcohol rubs fixes everything
                Absolutely- I do this probably once a month as a relatively casual video game player. Quite possibly a dash of OCD but it‚Äôs amazing how much better and calmer I feel playing after a fresh shower, hands washed, and controller cloroxed
                    Same , I even have a silicone cover for my controller to prevent scratches and for better grip.
            If your hands are greasy then just wash them first. Lol Sweat is another thing entirely tho.
                Right!  Never use a controller with dirty ass hands.  Even my little kids don‚Äôt do that shit.
            Yeah, but if the controller is having stick drift, it's impossible. You said the DualShock4 is easier to use than the Xbox 360/DualShock3 controller, so it was hard, but not impossible.
                I completed it on Xbox360 without any problems. The X360 controller is good for that mission even if there is no rubber on the joysticks remaining.
            nah WHAT 

are you playing in a sauna after eating a rotisserie chicken barehanded ?
                Nah. The greasy part was just an example, but the sweat is because it gets hot in the northeast in summer
            Wash your hands
                I do rather frequently, the grease was an example but the sweat was an issue from my extended gaming sessions.
    My controller would drift during this mission though. Just learn how to play with the drift. I know it‚Äôs hard. We all have played with controller drift. You could also just buy another controller. I went through 3 controllers on my Xbox one I had for 10 years.
    Try keeping the mouse 100% angled properly.
        bruh it‚Äôs easy
    Ah fuck off, I've completed this game 4 times I'm getting flashbacks now.
    Spunds loke a hardware issue not a game issue lol.
Exactly. At least this mission had that cool drug trip scene at the end with Michael flying around the city. Scouting the port is just boring through and through.
    Is scouting the port the one where you mess with shipping containers?
        Oh shit that one is actually the worst
            Yes. It really is. I‚Äôve often given up a play through at that mission. üòÇ
            As someone who just replayed the game, the shipping container one is better bc dropping the containers actually requires some mental focus. In the yoga mission they literally have u just hold ur joystick in a certain direction for a few seconds. It‚Äôs kind-numbingly boring
‚Äúhow about i run that prick over in this thing‚Äù rent free in my head. everytime i replayed the game i would skip that mission hearing that fucking line three times over üò≠
    I would skip the mission by running the prick over in that thing 3 times.
        you and me both
I don‚Äôt think you know what a sleeper is
    idk to me a sleeper is something thats just generally boring
        Most people would see it as shorthand for "sleeper hit", which refers to something that wasn't initially popular but gained more success as time went on
            Sleeper can also refer to a car that looks stock on the outside but is suped up under the hood. The term sleeper has several meanings and depending where you're from you'll be more inclined to assume a certain meaning. The point being people shouldn't through around vague terms like sleeper which just causes people to become confused and or waste their time having to ask what they meant...ect. I was thinking by sleeper mission he meant a mission that's seen as boring but in actuality is really good. Turns out he meant the opposite. Presicion beats being vague everytime when it comes to any form of communication.
            WTF? Never heard of the term "sleeper hit." You are projecting your life experience on everyone else and over applying what you think is common sense. Pro tip: "common sense" doesn't exist because not everyone has a common existence.
                Pro tip: the word "common" doesn't imply "everyone" but extends over the human experience as a whole, which, despite drastic cultural differences, is fairly similar in its essence. 

Examples of common sense include drinking water when you're thirsty, acting civil towards others in your community, not touching a hot object, not jumping off a cliff expecting to live, using the bathroom when you need to, driving or walking on the designated road or path, etc. 

Common sense does exist, it is just far simpler concept than you make it out to be. 

Also, "sleeper" is a fairly common term, but knowledge of it is not an example of "common sense" (nor do i see where anyone said it was).
        No, that isn't the usage of the term. 

A sleeper is something that at face value is assumed to be boring uninteresting and unremarkable. But turns out to have been really good. 

A sleeper is either hiding its greatness. Or is improperly presenting itself. Like a hit movie with an awful name. Or a nissan altima with a heavy duty diesel engine in it.
            my bad
Not going to lie, maybe I have a bit of the tism but I find that mission quite fun and unique ‚Äî¬†it's not just shooting people, collecting an objective and driving to a destination. Heavy machinery is cool
    Maybe ppl don't like the fact that infiltrating and casing a joint is a lengthy and tedious process IRL
        i think scouting the port (and the merryweather heist storyline in general) is fun on a first playthrough, but for me personally, on repeat playthroughs it feels like a chore.
    Same homie. Heavy machinery speaks to me on a primal level. I wish somebody told me about these occupations in high school.
Honestly, I don‚Äôt mind both of these missions as much.

If you‚Äôre talking about the submarine one (as the ‚Äúscouting one‚Äù), yeah, I hated going super slow, I definitely didn‚Äôt like that one. If it was the one when Trevor is operating the machines, it was okay.

I just don‚Äôt like being locked as Trevor in ‚ÄúAct 2‚Äù, even though some of his missions were badass.

The missions that I did hate were the preparations of the heists, they could have made them so much more compelling. Also the drug trip ones, I didn‚Äôt like it as well.
i had 0 issue with it, i don‚Äôt see why everyone hates it
What the fuck? People having greasy hands or stick drift because they're bad owners doesn't make the mission shitty. üòÇ this thread is something else.
The sanandreas red baron had me fuming as a 12 yearold
    SA had done ridiculously challenging/frustrating missions at the time.
‚ÄúNooooooo oh oh ohhh‚Äù in David Cross voice
    Curse you, Berkley. Curse youuuuuuu!
The racing mission in vice city where you had to beat your fucking driver in a race in order to get him to drive for you.
I dont mind Zero missions tho
    I absolutely hate Zero and his missions with every fiber in my body, i dont understand why CJ didn't just straight up killed Berkley the Bitch who would rather fight with RCs than just fight Zero's scrawny ass irl.
Came here to say exactly this lol
I enjoyed Zero's missions.

I didn't like Key To Her Heart as it is just a long tailing don't-get-caught mission. Your reward is then to date (or eliminate) the croupier. Then also Snail Trail where you follow the train from San Fiero to Los Santos in order to do another tailing mission behind a taxi. Sure, a misdion where you get to use the sniper rifle, but the reward for completing the mission is then being so far away from the next missions.
    I liked San Andreas all the way to the point where you had to take-over most of the gang territories for the final mission/s to unlock. It was just so boring and some of those spots never had any gang members
        Yea that was very tedious to say the least, most of the time I would end up roaming around just to find the 3rd gang member to trigger gang war.

And we dont even end up earning alot of money back at the safe house.
I commented this as well. Historically the worst GTA mission.
Fuck I hated those missions 

I first played GTA San Andreas when I was 7, but I didn‚Äôt beat it until I was 15 because I hated those missions so much
Especially the old version where gliding the plane still used fuel. Set the game down as a teenager and never picked it back up again because of the final one.
Nah, from someone who works in logistics, Trevor‚Äôs demeanor that entire mission is hilarious
    Thank fuck I‚Äôm high as a kite
        In transport, you‚Äôre either a Trevor or a Floyd. There is no In between
            HOW ABOUT I RUN THAT PRICK OVER IN THIS THING
                [How about I run that prick over in this thing.](https://youtu.be/ewSu4Jd9SbA?si=S0oYKBtkCmcvQOnE)
                *HOW BOAT I RUN THAT PRICK OVER IN THIS THING
            This is so accurate lmfao
            I know who I would be.
        It would be even better if there was an option when playing as Trevor to do some sort of drug that gives you some kind of in game intoxication handicap and then attempt the mission. Psychedelic visual effects, drunken effects, stimulant effects, etc. paired with radio station music from your cellphone that would make the box loading game more realistic and immersive.
        sir, you should not be operating this vehicle under the influence
            I‚ÄôLL operate YOU, under the influence
        Any time I‚Äôm high af I actually say that lmfao cuz of Trevor
        Sir, you shouldn't be operating this vehicle under the influence!
    Yeah Trevor running off while Floyd gets beat down by Merryweather was pretty funny, but then Wade was a damn tragedy lol
        It just kept coming, and coming
honestly, the whole merryweather heist in general just pisses me off. you get NOTHING for it, and it‚Äôs one of the most convoluted heists in the fucking game
    Yeah, it felt a lot like the diamonds from gta4. Like there is more there that would probably make sense in a SP DLC that never came.
        exactly! when i first played through the story mode i was thinking they pulled out all the stops, but then i heard about all the cut content (like the raid on madrazo‚Äôs house which would have been EPIC) and i just felt really sad :‚Äô/
            It's really shitty they cut all single player dlc cuz the GTA5 heist stuff is actually really well done and I liked planning then executing the heists. Had so much potential for a huge variety of heists.

Then they slammed it all into GTA: "How much money can we squeeze from whales?"
    I‚Äôm glad someone said it
    Another is the Merriweather train, I fell of so many times when trevor uses motorcycle to get to front of the train. I kinda like the results, that said better than CJ. nice reference to SA
The crate thing is bar-able for me but this is mission is just annoying
I actually liked that mission.
That's Mafia II dude /s
    Damn you reminded me. I love Mafia 2. One of the best storylines in gaming imo
    Well, in Mafia 2 you only have to move a couple of crates
        And that was cool as hell, really immersive imo. You want to go commit crimes instead, but thats the point: so does your character. Its the boredom > crime pipeline
        I like that the more boxes you move, Vito becomes progressively more and more pissy
    The dock mission. I loaded about 7 of them, I was like wait this is mafia game so I left lol
        Everyone downvoting you can fuck off lol honestly thinking about this mission makes me want to replay mafia 2 üòÇ I also just watched ‚Äúthe offer‚Äù on paramount‚Äôs streaming site so I‚Äôm in that zone. I played mafia 2 (the remastered DE version) for the first time in 2020 and was fully hooked from start to finish. Played through it in about 3 days during the pandemic lol. Also proof that games don‚Äôt need to be elongated / filled with fluff to be masterpieces
        I kept loading them until the game wouldn‚Äôt let me anymore.  With Vito whining the whole time
I hate using the submarine since it doesnt even have a  radio.
    I think the controls on the sub suck
        It also is used in one of the most shallow parts of the game world. Everytime I went below the surface by even an inch it felt like I was scraping bottom. Also played the original release and there was nothing so depressing as driving a sub through the soupy water of the LS docks.
    That trip over to where Floyd picks you up takes *forever* in that silent sub.
I weirdly enjoyed that mission, and right after I always just hauled ass to the next part because the truck felt great to drive. 

Can‚Äôt explain why, really.
The dialogue is awesome on that mission
And the helicopter tracking mission with Trevor and Franklin where you have to use the sonar camera shit to find the guy in the parking garage.
I liked driving that loader, wasn't too long
I hated that one the second time around and realised why I had no memory of it at all from the first time. I just ended up blocking out all recollection of having done it. It must have glitched when I tried to finish it because I was stuck on one of the last parts for ages trying to get the damn things to register as being placed. Wasn't sure if physics shifted it out of wack. That and it repeated more than once rather than try to mix things up with various other kinds of tasks. Just awful.

What's so bad about the yoga? You have to hold some button prompts for a few seconds to some comically uninteresting visuals. Honestly if this was the worst mission then they didn't really do anything bad at all.
What's the mission where you get a text of a tiny portion of the map and have to find it
And getting yelled at by Trevor for having no idea what the f to do
That mission is fine, save for when i'd accidentally slip off of the ladder and fall to my death!
Horrible take.
    How? Have you even played the mission?
Is there a clip of this?
    I watched a video of him talking about it either on his channel or in an interview recently, but can‚Äôt remember exactly which video. He just said it was a pain in the ass to record because they had to capture all the mess ups during every single pose as well as all the successful attempts. He said he wasn‚Äôt super limber and the yoga instructor was actually getting frustrated with him. Said it took them about 8hrs of doing yoga to capture it all and he was very sore afterwards.

Edit: nevermind, I found the clip. [Here is the full video](https://www.youtube.com/live/eZQVnK6eS5w?si=T3qUJFM4TppnvnJ8). His commentary on this scene starts at around the 8 minute mark
        "Maybe he didn't have balls because he was a Yoga Instructor"

Fucking dying.
        the fact that his wife was doing yoga irl too wtf
        omg this is gold. ned is so funny he is literally michael üòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠
    [Here you go!](https://www.youtube.com/live/eZQVnK6eS5w?si=T3qUJFM4TppnvnJ8) It starts at about the 8 minute mark.
        Thanks. I ended up watching that for about 50 minutes.
Funny how his real wife was getting mad at him while trying to do yoga.
            Yeah, Ned is pretty funny and I love hearing the behind the scenes commentary from him directly. I want to watch his whole GTAV playthrough, but that‚Äôs a lot of hours!
                Badass how he actually played the game he stars in. Getting a role in a Rockstar game should come with a contractual obligation to play through the game one time. Maybe make exceptions for people (over 80, blind, no hands, etc.)  

These guys who go around doing interviews about a game they've never played are a real downer and starring in any Rockstar game is a lifetime position - you'll literally be interviewed and asked about it until you die.
        hero
    He has a whole YouTube channel he‚Äôs going through a mission per day he streams is live dude
        There must have been some point when playing the game where it clicked and he had the profound realization that *GTA V is an amazing game*. He'd heard it from everyone and he knew how badass Rockstar is but on some level he must have had some doubts until he actually got immersed in it.
> I replayed the most just to get high on horse tranquilizers and vibe to the music.

My man getting dropping into a K-hole for some GTA V. Respect.
100% - epic and iconic mission in the series!
One of my favorite parts of the whole game. This is a brain dead take like saying the train mission in San Andreas is impossible
It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down. I had the radio on, I was drivin'
    Runnin down a dream
The missions themselves are not bad to me, it is just hearing her annoying ass ramble about nothing.
    His loss, your gain suga
Stuff of nightmares
This is the correct answer imo. I found Tanya to be a completely forgettable character and the missions are so slow/repetitive/uninteresting. Only value I think this adds is showing Franklin being from the hood (helping out his buddy who was two drugged up to show up for work) and explaining some incredibly lackluster background on franklin‚Äôs relationship to his community
    It sucks you can‚Äôt kill her
        the duality of gta players
        Lmao it would be funny AF if you had to ice Tonya in the death wish mission
if your brothers a longshoreman you should. Those jobs are absolute money in the bank
    That may be, but I‚Äôm on a maintenance contract and I have so much downtime here, I‚Äôm practically getting paid just to chill. Easy money.
Gave my buddy lunchables to beat it for me.
    Multiple lunchables?! That man hustled you! Haha
        Calm down. I hated the turkey ones, and he only got two. 
 So, who really got fleeced here?
    r/nocontext
        Lmao lil bit of the ol school yard nasty tugs.
Yup. Fuck that mission.
Yea I never even passed it lol
    This was a mission you handed over to the big bro to get done
        I am the  big bro, I hated it too.
            As a big bro, I beat it once and then beat it again when my sis was playing it. Definitely the most hated mission in GTA history.
Literally was gonna say this one lol, for sure the worst
From what I remember that was easy
![gif](giphy|2hf0ufsIWT2lkXam5w|downsized)
That and throwing that damn grenade through the window
Never forget watching my buddy try to beat this one for like a month.

Don't think either one of us ever did.

Fuck that mission.
THIS. I just finished that yesterday. I would rather die than do it again
Lol, this mission is triggering what? A decade later?
That is a glorious sentence. Bravo.
Especially at start, by that time u are shooting people and that mission doesn't really fit, it should been the first mission before Lamar and frank take the doc cars
yea i love the missions that are ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô in rockstar games
Scouting the Port is atrocious
    Imagine if you had to do it with Michael‚Äôs family üò∞
        Amanda, Tracey, and Jimmy all complaining whilst you slowly move crates
Idk, Father/Son and Daddy's little girl are some of my favorite missions
Biking in GTA San Andreas (PS2) might actually be more fun than biking in GTA V.
I think they wanted to make them unique and ended up being boring
    True.
At least you can complete the rest of the story without completing all of the Zero missions.
That mission was weird. It didn‚Äôt build on anything, it didn‚Äôt lead into anything. It just wasted time and lord help you if you somehow fail after getting all the way to LS
    That mission is so aggravating because if you fail it‚Äôs always in the dumbest way, especially with that ‚ÄúSpook-O-Meter‚Äù
Ikr. She‚Äôs a whole mess of crazy but she kinda bad tho
#Thanks for sharing your answer
Similar. Every time I was forced to do yoga I got pissed off and thought how I could be doing actual yoga and so I did.
Jesus
Do it to all missions and then you can cheat and complete the game in an hour
Worst doesn't mean hard
The only thing that saves this mission for me is dialogue. Legit, I find Trevor pretty funny on this one.
Don't remind me...
    Worse if your hands are greasy or sweaty. 

When I first played this mission, I was angry because my thumbs kept fucking slipping off the sticks. It became INFINITELY easier with the PS4 version because of the concave sticks
        I don't EVER hold my controller with greasy or sweaty hands. 

A quick isopropyl alcohol rubs fixes everything
            Absolutely- I do this probably once a month as a relatively casual video game player. Quite possibly a dash of OCD but it‚Äôs amazing how much better and calmer I feel playing after a fresh shower, hands washed, and controller cloroxed
                Same , I even have a silicone cover for my controller to prevent scratches and for better grip.
        If your hands are greasy then just wash them first. Lol Sweat is another thing entirely tho.
            Right!  Never use a controller with dirty ass hands.  Even my little kids don‚Äôt do that shit.
        Yeah, but if the controller is having stick drift, it's impossible. You said the DualShock4 is easier to use than the Xbox 360/DualShock3 controller, so it was hard, but not impossible.
            I completed it on Xbox360 without any problems. The X360 controller is good for that mission even if there is no rubber on the joysticks remaining.
        nah WHAT 

are you playing in a sauna after eating a rotisserie chicken barehanded ?
            Nah. The greasy part was just an example, but the sweat is because it gets hot in the northeast in summer
        Wash your hands
            I do rather frequently, the grease was an example but the sweat was an issue from my extended gaming sessions.
My controller would drift during this mission though. Just learn how to play with the drift. I know it‚Äôs hard. We all have played with controller drift. You could also just buy another controller. I went through 3 controllers on my Xbox one I had for 10 years.
Try keeping the mouse 100% angled properly.
    bruh it‚Äôs easy
Ah fuck off, I've completed this game 4 times I'm getting flashbacks now.
Spunds loke a hardware issue not a game issue lol.
Is scouting the port the one where you mess with shipping containers?
    Oh shit that one is actually the worst
        Yes. It really is. I‚Äôve often given up a play through at that mission. üòÇ
        As someone who just replayed the game, the shipping container one is better bc dropping the containers actually requires some mental focus. In the yoga mission they literally have u just hold ur joystick in a certain direction for a few seconds. It‚Äôs kind-numbingly boring
I would skip the mission by running the prick over in that thing 3 times.
    you and me both
idk to me a sleeper is something thats just generally boring
    Most people would see it as shorthand for "sleeper hit", which refers to something that wasn't initially popular but gained more success as time went on
        Sleeper can also refer to a car that looks stock on the outside but is suped up under the hood. The term sleeper has several meanings and depending where you're from you'll be more inclined to assume a certain meaning. The point being people shouldn't through around vague terms like sleeper which just causes people to become confused and or waste their time having to ask what they meant...ect. I was thinking by sleeper mission he meant a mission that's seen as boring but in actuality is really good. Turns out he meant the opposite. Presicion beats being vague everytime when it comes to any form of communication.
        WTF? Never heard of the term "sleeper hit." You are projecting your life experience on everyone else and over applying what you think is common sense. Pro tip: "common sense" doesn't exist because not everyone has a common existence.
            Pro tip: the word "common" doesn't imply "everyone" but extends over the human experience as a whole, which, despite drastic cultural differences, is fairly similar in its essence. 

Examples of common sense include drinking water when you're thirsty, acting civil towards others in your community, not touching a hot object, not jumping off a cliff expecting to live, using the bathroom when you need to, driving or walking on the designated road or path, etc. 

Common sense does exist, it is just far simpler concept than you make it out to be. 

Also, "sleeper" is a fairly common term, but knowledge of it is not an example of "common sense" (nor do i see where anyone said it was).
    No, that isn't the usage of the term. 

A sleeper is something that at face value is assumed to be boring uninteresting and unremarkable. But turns out to have been really good. 

A sleeper is either hiding its greatness. Or is improperly presenting itself. Like a hit movie with an awful name. Or a nissan altima with a heavy duty diesel engine in it.
        my bad
Maybe ppl don't like the fact that infiltrating and casing a joint is a lengthy and tedious process IRL
    i think scouting the port (and the merryweather heist storyline in general) is fun on a first playthrough, but for me personally, on repeat playthroughs it feels like a chore.
Same homie. Heavy machinery speaks to me on a primal level. I wish somebody told me about these occupations in high school.
SA had done ridiculously challenging/frustrating missions at the time.
Curse you, Berkley. Curse youuuuuuu!
I absolutely hate Zero and his missions with every fiber in my body, i dont understand why CJ didn't just straight up killed Berkley the Bitch who would rather fight with RCs than just fight Zero's scrawny ass irl.
I liked San Andreas all the way to the point where you had to take-over most of the gang territories for the final mission/s to unlock. It was just so boring and some of those spots never had any gang members
    Yea that was very tedious to say the least, most of the time I would end up roaming around just to find the 3rd gang member to trigger gang war.

And we dont even end up earning alot of money back at the safe house.
Thank fuck I‚Äôm high as a kite
    In transport, you‚Äôre either a Trevor or a Floyd. There is no In between

Everyone downvoting you can fuck off lol honestly thinking about this mission makes me want to replay mafia 2 üòÇ I also just watched ‚Äúthe offer‚Äù on paramount‚Äôs streaming site so I‚Äôm in that zone. I played mafia 2 (the remastered DE version) for the first time in 2020 and was fully hooked from start to finish. Played through it in about 3 days during the pandemic lol. Also proof that games don‚Äôt need to be elongated / filled with fluff to be masterpieces
I kept loading them until the game wouldn‚Äôt let me anymore.  With Vito whining the whole time
It also is used in one of the most shallow parts of the game world. Everytime I went below the surface by even an inch it felt like I was scraping bottom. Also played the original release and there was nothing so depressing as driving a sub through the soupy water of the LS docks.
"Maybe he didn't have balls because he was a Yoga Instructor"

Fucking dying.
the fact that his wife was doing yoga irl too wtf
omg this is gold. ned is so funny he is literally michael üòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠
Thanks. I ended up watching that for about 50 minutes.
Funny how his real wife was getting mad at him while trying to do yoga.
    Yeah, Ned is pretty funny and I love hearing the behind the scenes commentary from him directly. I want to watch his whole GTAV playthrough, but that‚Äôs a lot of hours!
        Badass how he actually played the game he stars in. Getting a role in a Rockstar game should come with a contractual obligation to play through the game one time. Maybe make exceptions for people (over 80, blind, no hands, etc.)  

These guys who go around doing interviews about a game they've never played are a real downer and starring in any Rockstar game is a lifetime position - you'll literally be interviewed and asked about it until you die.
hero
There must have been some point when playing the game where it clicked and he had the profound realization that *GTA V is an amazing game*. He'd heard it from everyone and he knew how badass Rockstar is but on some level he must have had some doubts until he actually got immersed in it.
the duality of gta players
Lmao it would be funny AF if you had to ice Tonya in the death wish mission
Calm down. I hated the turkey ones, and he only got two. 
 So, who really got fleeced here?
Lmao lil bit of the ol school yard nasty tugs.
I am the  big bro, I hated it too.
    As a big bro, I beat it once and then beat it again when my sis was playing it. Definitely the most hated mission in GTA history.
Amanda, Tracey, and Jimmy all complaining whilst you slowly move crates
I don't EVER hold my controller with greasy or sweaty hands. 

A quick isopropyl alcohol rubs fixes everything
    Absolutely- I do this probably once a month as a relatively casual video game player. Quite possibly a dash of OCD but it‚Äôs amazing how much better and calmer I feel playing after a fresh shower, hands washed, and controller cloroxed
        Same , I even have a silicone cover for my controller to prevent scratches and for better grip.
If your hands are greasy then just wash them first. Lol Sweat is another thing entirely tho.
    Right!  Never use a controller with dirty ass hands.  Even my little kids don‚Äôt do that shit.
Yeah, but if the controller is having stick drift, it's impossible. You said the DualShock4 is easier to use than the Xbox 360/DualShock3 controller, so it was hard, but not impossible.
    I completed it on Xbox360 without any problems. The X360 controller is good for that mission even if there is no rubber on the joysticks remaining.
nah WHAT 

are you playing in a sauna after eating a rotisserie chicken barehanded ?
    Nah. The greasy part was just an example, but the sweat is because it gets hot in the northeast in summer
Wash your hands
    I do rather frequently, the grease was an example but the sweat was an issue from my extended gaming sessions.
Yes. It really is. I‚Äôve often given up a play through at that mission. üòÇ
As someone who just replayed the game, the shipping container one is better bc dropping the containers actually requires some mental focus. In the yoga mission they literally have u just hold ur joystick in a certain direction for a few seconds. It‚Äôs kind-numbingly boring
Sleeper can also refer to a car that looks stock on the outside but is suped up under the hood. The term sleeper has several meanings and depending where you're from you'll be more inclined to assume a certain meaning. The point being people shouldn't through around vague terms like sleeper which just causes people to become confused and or waste their time having to ask what they meant...ect. I was thinking by sleeper mission he meant a mission that's seen as boring but in actuality is really good. Turns out he meant the opposite. Presicion beats being vague everytime when it comes to any form of communication.
WTF? Never heard of the term "sleeper hit." You are projecting your life experience on everyone else and over applying what you think is common sense. Pro tip: "common sense" doesn't exist because not everyone has a common existence.
    Pro tip: the word "common" doesn't imply "everyone" but extends over the human experience as a whole, which, despite drastic cultural differences, is fairly similar in its essence. 

Examples of common sense include drinking water when you're thirsty, acting civil towards others in your community, not touching a hot object, not jumping off a cliff expecting to live, using the bathroom when you need to, driving or walking on the designated road or path, etc. 

Common sense does exist, it is just far simpler concept than you make it out to be. 

Also, "sleeper" is a fairly common term, but knowledge of it is not an example of "common sense" (nor do i see where anyone said it was).
my bad

This is so accurate lmfao
I know who I would be.

It's really shitty they cut all single player dlc cuz the GTA5 heist stuff is actually really well done and I liked planning then executing the heists. Had so much potential for a huge variety of heists.

Then they slammed it all into GTA: "How much money can we squeeze from whales?"
Yeah, Ned is pretty funny and I love hearing the behind the scenes commentary from him directly. I want to watch his whole GTAV playthrough, but that‚Äôs a lot of hours!
