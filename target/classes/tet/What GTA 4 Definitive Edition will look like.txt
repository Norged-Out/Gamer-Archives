[[What GTA 4 Definitive Edition will look like]]





mf looks straight outta ratatouille
    linguini’s gangsta uncle
        This has me dying
    OP must be playing the alpha already.

    Lol if ratatouille and the simpsons had a baby
    "I killed a man... with THIS THUMB!"
    Hhahahahhqh
i know at least 8 mfs that look exactly like this
    Same tho
Pixar present: grand theft auto
    Rated G
        For “Going Bowling”
    A pixar animated video game would be sick NGL
        A game were you kill all the rats in level 1 as that old grandma in “ratatouille: origins”
            Ok
                I would pay all the money I have for a game like that
        Kena: Bridge of Spirits was made by a team of former animators... Not Pixar level, but the same idea.
        Disney Infinity?

    I’d like them to bring it to next gen consoles with nothing done to it
        I just want some optimization patches and I'm good
        Me too after the Definitive edition nonsense, but is it really so much to ask for actual remakes of all of Rockstar's main GTA series? I mean, it seems stupid that they're going cheap on what will absolutely be their biggest cultural impact ever. You'd think they'd respect their own history enough to do them properly.

What they've done is taken their golden goose and cooked it for a short term profit, rather than exploiting those golden eggs for years to come.

I guess they don't care because it gave them GTA Online, something that gives them a stream of solid cash... for now. But they'll one day find out that if they keep upsetting their fanbase, people might eventually lose interest in the series.
            They could have made full on remakes for each of those games and sell them as standalones. And if it was made using the GTA5 engine they could use the new assets they made for GTA online as well.
            People are _right now_ losing interest in their series.  My friends and I are peeved enough to turn our noses up at GTA 6 should it ever materialize.

Which it won’t.  Rockstar’s (glory and reputation) days are over.  Dan Hauser and Leslie Benzies left their companies in the hands of greedy lawyers.
            It's not Rockstar's Fault. Nor is is it the Developers themselves faults. The fault for the trilogy lies with Take Two's Executives. Take Two Executives have decided that Short Term profits far exceed Long time Profit, whose end will lead to extremely cheaply made games, that will ultimately cause Take Two's Executive Board to virtually Annihilate Rockstar as a Gaming Development Company. Take Two bought out Rockstar, and Rockstar went into Studio Decline after Dan Houser left. There is no original Gaming studio of the PS2 era left with Rockstar or most other companies. Those companies, have new executives, with more greed then sense, and more young developers who want only a paycheck and comfortable job and care little for their Content. This has been happening not just in the Gaming Industry of the U.S, but since 1991, with the end of the cold war, All Industries in the US and Worldwide have went from Product Oriented (has QC, etc.) To Service Oriented (lack of QC, etc.). Don't blame the creative talent for their lack of work. They were explicitly told by the Exec's to not deliver the Remaster we wanted. They couldn't go over their hourly or salary wage. Else they'd lose their job. This is how this industry works. I utterly hate it, when people hate on the wrong man, just trying to make his way in life.
        I would love a straight up gta iv next gen patch or version. Just graphics and resolution improvements.

The series x version (backwards compatibility) runs really good, only downside it still runs the 360 resolution at 720p.

I agree though last thing i would want is GSG "improving" it.
            still looks incredible on higher resolutions. playing it right now on the dog shit PC port but it runs stable enough to enjoy it
                Does it run any better after they removed the "games for windows" or whatever it was?  
I recall it being a bit choppy before.
                    Yes and No I guess. I remember before they got rid of that I always had trouble just logging in to the fucking game in the first place so if that's what your issue was then yeah that's gone but they just replaced it with the social club launcher the asshats, but my PC is from 2014 and it runs it at like 50 FPS mostly consistently when in the city and fluid indoors so as long as you don't have an ooga booga caveman pc it should run adequately.

There's supposedly this method of adding this Linux file to your .exe folder thats supposed to double your framerate but I followed the install guide to the letter and it took my FPS down to 5 or 7 when outdoors but fluid 60 indoors

PC games during that whole games for windows live era really got fucked I hope whoever came up with that shit is sleeping with the fishes
                        There is a Vulkan wrapper available that fixes performance on GTAIV if you have a decent machine. I went from a stuttery 10-20 fps mess to 60+ fps buttery smoothness after installing it this past weekend.
                            That's the one I was referring to.  The two .dll files you put into your exe folder?I used the guide on the front page of the store on steam. it just made me performance tank
                        I had an i5 (6th gen) and 1050ti at the time, I think. GTA5 ran ok with those cpu/gpu, but GTA4 didn't seem to.
                            like I said it's a dog shit port regardless of the external issues.
        I would like it to be optimized for current generations, an example is resident evil 4 and 5, both are very old games but optimized to play at 1080p and 60fps. I'd really love to see that with GTA 4 because the game is perfect as is but the graphics feel a little odd.
        Adding the Rockstar Editor would be nice, plus not completely removing all audio when you capture clips (like backward compatible IV does).
        That would be cool. But I would prefer the PS5 just being backwards compatible with the pre-PS4 console games.
    I recently got it on a Xbox sale a few weeks ago before the "Definitive" trilogy collection came out. I didn't have the Xbox 360 or PS3 till the very end of both it's life cycles in 2013 and by that time I was playing GTA V and just missed out on it really.

I regret not getting a used copy for cheap or just downloading it after all these years, but to my surprise I found out it was backwards compatible with the series XS and Xbox one so I've been playing it this week and it has been such an amazing experience and I wish I could go back in time to 2008 and actually play it when it came out. I love the atmosphere of liberty city, Niko is such a great protagonist and I absolutely love cousin Roman lol.
        I’m loving it too. I did not touch video games for about 5 years. Then played gta 3 for about 2 months (my previous favorite game). Remembered I had IV on Xbox 360 and played it for a bit. Was blown away. Today I upgraded to a series s and bought IV. What a masterpiece. It plays extremely well with no dropped frames (my Xbox 360 experience was poor - lots of frame drops and poor graphics). It’s such an upgrade from GTA 3 (my favorite game) and feels like the first time I played GTA 3. Very happy now :) , sorry for the rambling.
    You've probably seen this but if not please check it out:

It's one of the most entertaining little GTAIV clips I've ever seen - "There Will Be Consequences".
    [deleted]
        Seeing how they delisted old copies of 3, VC and SA (There goes my dream of seeing them on GOG), it's reasonable to assume they'd delis the original 4, if it was ever "improved".

All this delisting achieves is promote piracy.
    I dunno the driving is garbage, the water looks terrible, there's definitely some good upgrades that could be done by a real game studio.
        > the driving is garbage

False.  It is just not the arcade style of the other games in the series.
    Pretty weird choice for a favourite game...
        What do you mean? It’s a great fucking game the gameplay is great , physics are more realistic than most games even today and the multiplayer in its prime was epic. Playing full lobby cops n crooks is still the most fun I’ve had in any multiplayer game to this day
            Physics doesn't make a game, fun gameplay does which gta 4 lacked imo but whatever.
                Why is it you keep chasing after people who loves IV in this thread?
    There’s already rumors that they’ll be remastering IV, lost and damned, and ballad of gay Tony. I personally look forward to it
    Welp they putting their hands back on it 😭
Don’t even joke about this. GTA 4 remains the only main GTA game after 3, and non-spinoff not to be ruined by shitty remasters and shitty Online. 

GTA 4 now stands alone as a relic representing the once great name of GTA and Rockstar Games. It must be protected.
    I'm seriously tempted to get a disc version for GTA IV and RDR just in case R* continues with their shit.
        You can just pirate them
            Well rdr can't be pirated on pc
                Sure it can, via PS3 emulator

                    woah thank you
                        your welcome mate!
                It  can be, but it still has terrible performance.
        I never got rid of mine haha
        RDR can still be downloaded on xbox. It even runs in 4K if you have an xbox x (1440p on series s, i think)
        Bought a 360 copy of RDR goty for this reason even though i don't have a xbox at this time.
    GTA 1 and 2? Liberty and Vice City stories?
        Yeah well, you know, not many people are thinking about those ones. I like the stories games though, but they get overlooked
            Especially VCS, easily the best 3d universe game overall
                VCS is like a rarity these days. You’d be forgiven for not even knowing it existed. Can’t even buy it on the store. I would like to play it again on the Vita (yes, I still have a Vita)
                    VCS is so far, the only GTA game exculsive to Playstation, since It can only be played on the PSP and PS2. Imo, It deserves a re-release
        He said after 3
    Gta 4 graphics still holds up. Dont remaster that if you turn the game into shit.
        And it plays in glorious 60fps on newer Xbox consoles.
    They did release that one update just to strip songs out of the game.  And the game launched with something like seven forms of DRM that will make it progressively harder to play over the years.
        Thank fuck I have the PS3 original. They can’t take songs from me haha. Perks of being a console player
    GTA4 on PC had that god awful games for Windows live DRM.
    You do realize that GTA 3, VC and SA still exist in a dozen or so other formats, right?  

None of them have been "ruined" by the remasters if they still exist.  Just because you can't legit buy them digitally any more doesn't mean there aren't a bunch of ways to obtain them, both physically and digitally.
    LMAO. What about GTA LCS, GTA VCS, GTA, GTA II, GTA London, GTA Advance, GTA CTW?
        Edited original comment 👍
            Your comment is still incorrect because GTA CTW would not be considered a spin off.
                It is a spinoff
                    No it's not. It takes place in the HD universe between GTA IV and GTA V. Sure it has elements that take place in the GTA IV triad storyline but you wouldn't have needed to have played GTA IV first to understand what is going on and the story stands on it's own two feet. In fact the connection is so small, it's more like an easter egg than an actual main plotline. It isn't like GTA LCS where a minor character is given their own game.

And even though it has connections to GTA IV and GTA V...going by that logic, all GTA games are spin-offs of each other and therefore your comment still wouldn't make sense.
                        It’s still a spinoff of the HD games just like GTA Advance was a spinoff of the 3D games. It isn’t even acknowledged in V at all. 

And what makes Huang Lee any better than Tony? Huang was just a random name on the police database in GTA 4…talk about minor character. 

My comment makes perfect sense hence why it is upvoted as much as it is. Sorry buddy.
                            Okay then. Let's just agree to disagree and call it even.
    Gta 4 was already ruined by poor optimization, bland story, wannabe "realistic" driving, cut content from SA and repetitive missions. No wonder it got so much criticism when it released. Rockstar doesn't even acknowledge it's existence lmao.
        Poor optimizaion is literally the only part of your comment that's applicable, the rest are all subject to opinion
            And that was only on the PC. On console it ran fine
            Repetitive missions and no variety.... anyone who has played it even once would know but yeah sure.
                [deleted]
                    Gta 5 was the exact opposite of being repetitive. Every mission was unique so I don't know how anyone could think otherwise. You may not like the game but the game is anything but repetitive.
                        let me rephrase my answer.

in my opinion gta5 didn't really sit right with me, firstly the humour felt forced and they went for more over the top gameplay than in gta4. My second point is that the story didn't feel as coherent in 5 than it did in 4 and for that reason I couldn't really connect with the characters, whereas in gta4 you get somewhat attached to certain characters such as roman for example.

Finally due to the realism in gta4 you understand the meaning of the game.

Sure gta5 is more comprehensive in terms of a sandbox game but in terms of story gta4 outdoes it.
                            This

I gave uo GTA V's story, Its honestly one of the weaker ones in the series
                                the cycle of trevor hating michael was extremely repetitive and i remember getting really sick and tired of it by the end
                                    I completed only past the first heist and i felt burned out alr.

Its that bad imo
        Lol Good one. Go to any GTA 4 vs 5 video and look at the comments. Try not to cry 😢
            Only a clown would take youtube comments seriously. Moreover the vocal majority doesn't count. More people love and play gta 5 and that's what matters. Gta 4 toxic players verbally abuse other players and spew venom in the youtube comments sections. I'm sure you are one of those people who'd trash gta 6 when it comes out and suddenly start praising gta 5.
                Hey  clown look at your downvotes and sit down boy, your   opinion is wrong and that's a fact. Now be quiet, the grown ups are talking.
                now go home and take your sharkcards
                    It's as if you didn't even read what I wrote. Well...can't expect much from folks like you. Can't even take folks like you seriously.
                        nostalgic?...bruh i play gta v first before i went to gta iv
                Lol…I guess you cried 😂. The only people playing GTA V are the brainless losers buying Shark cards lmao.
                Meh, only a clown would also take your Reddit comments seriously too 🤷‍♂️
    How did shitty online ruin GTA 5 ? I think it was additive (in a shitty way that I didn't really buy into) but I don't really think it *detracted* from the single player experience. I think GTA 5 was the peak of the series cause it was largely the same as IV but the superior SA map and vehicles made free roaming and fucking around more fun. The story was kinda shit but there were still some really good missions.
        5 single player was lackluster
            I agree the story was lackluster. I still think the missions had some great moments. Also, what about the other SP stuff: the free roam, the map, the stunt jumps, mowing down cows in slow-mo cinematic view ? Mt. chilliad with 4 stars ? military base ? big shitty dump trucks, parking a bunch of busses in front of the LRT, off roading in raton canyon ? 

None of that does anything for you ?
                All that stuff is fine, 5 is far from a bad game it’s just a weak GTA game. It’s the most boring map of the series for me, and the country is just pure wasted space. How many times can you do an off road race? Or attack the military base? It doesn’t keep you engaged especially when the gameplay just feels lacking, the shooting mechanics are boring and lack oomph, guns sound really weak, being able to carry all weapons removes any balance, the driving requires no real skill or thought so chases are less compelling, the physics are downgraded so crashes are just boring. It’s missing a lot of side missions that are crime based too. 

In GTA 4 you have Jacob’s drug deliveries, Brucie’s car thefts, Stevie’s car thefts, the most wanted, and later the Assassinations, all of these can result in unscripted emergent gameplay moments because they are built into the world organically, so gangs and cops can interfere. They also all feel like things Niko would actually do. Add the two DLC’s and you have the amazing Gang and Drug Wars, yet more vehicle thefts, and those epic vehicle Triathlons with nitro. They feel more connected to the world. 

5’s side activities just feel dropped in there for the sake of having content. Lester has less assassinations, and they’re all scripted to hell, no gang wars of any kind. It barely even feels like there are gangs in the game. Franklin needed some gang wars at least. Trevor could’ve had meth heads and rural gangs attacking his cook house etc. Instead he gets a pitiful four bounty missions. I liked them a lot, why just 4?? Should have been twice that at least. It’s like they legit ran out of dev time or couldn’t be bothered. Trevor does have drug drops at his airport, but they are also very scripted so the emergent gameplay potential is lost. Even hanging out in 5 with the other protagonists is crap, why can’t you switch characters? That was the big selling point of the game!! Imagine the trouble you could get up to if you could switch between them and strategically place them about. And this doesn’t even work in missions where they are together as they just go back to a predetermined spot and select their own weapon. It is just bad, eliminates any strategy and shows that the switch mechanic and mission design is poorly thought out. 

And the cops AI…it is the worst in the series by far, they literally spawn on the side of the mountain if you’re up there, and have inhuman aiming abilities so fights are just not that fun because you just get absolutely swarmed by cops spawning off screen.
                    Thanks for the reply. I think your points about lack of trevor-rural gang missions, and complete absence of Franklin gang-activity are very solid and to your point, probably can be explained by the focus on online development. The off road races *were* garbage and way too easy. I never did them all. When I say offroading i'm just referring to souping up a pickup and doin my own thing. I never noticed vehicle physics being any worse than before and still enjoy destroying vehicles, are they downgraded from IV ? True that the military base isn't great, and when you finally do get away successfully with a tank, it blows up way too easy. They put a lot of work into that base though which is kind of a shame actually.

I'm not sure Niko would hang out with a guy like Brucie lol and I can't actually remember those other side missions. I will have to play IV again cause it's been a while. I played gay tony and L&D and those were great but I never checked out gang and drug wars so maybe I have some homework.

You *can* switch characters, just not while wanted. I never considered the idea you could use that strategically if it was executed better, but good point. I always just used it when I got sick of a character or got stranded. I was glad to have the option in those cases.

I enjoyed the 5 assassinations, especially the stock market manipulation aspect. It feels scripted for sure, but what's not to like about blowing the lifeintruder CEO's face apart with a cell phone bomb, from the comfort of micheals living room ? 

Cop AI *was* kinda shitty. Worst in the series? maybe. again, I have to play IV again. I know they are still fun to fuck around with. I thoroughly enjoy spawning cops on top of mountains, so I thought that makes up for the inconvenience of them spawning where they don't make sense to spawn. They are super difficult in GTA 5 above 3 stars, so I usually just chill with 2-3. I think that's realistic though given that it's generally pretty easy for a police force to fuck up one guy if they really need to.

I was also pretty happy with most of the humor of the game being in line with what I expected from the series. They still lambast the corporations and consumerism. I'm really concerned they will lose sight of this aspect soon but I think 5 hit the mark still. 

For what it's worth, I didn't actually *hate* online either. The big bank heist was decent but the load times, hackers, and mission grinding kinda wrecked it for me. I would much rather have had them put all that online effort into SP but overall I think 5 will be the last great one. 6 should be great given how long it's taking but I suspect they will go even harder into the online, pay to play aspects.
                        Sure getting in a buggy and doing some off roading is fun I won’t deny that, but it’s not enough I don’t think. The map feels largely unused outside of the city. The physics of vehicles are different but I meant the physics that happen when you crash, in IV you fly out the windscreen and the car buckles under the impact. If you crash a bike you go over the handlebars at the speed you crashed and literally soar through the air. You really feel the crashes in IV, in V they are nerfed to the point that car deformation is severely cut back and the crashes themselves lack impact. 

Niko would definitely hang out with Brucie, if you listen to their dialogues it becomes clear just why their friendship works despite them being polar opposites. The gang and drug wars are probably the best side missions in the entire GTA IV saga, they are simply pure GTA. Rolling up on a crew in a blacked out SUV, shooting the place up and fucking off with their coke slung over your back while the cops chase you… it doesn’t get more GTA than that. 

I meant switch characters in V when you are hanging out with the other two. You can get all three of them to hang out, but you can’t switch you are stuck with the one who initiates the hang out. The switch is ok in free roam  if you find yourself in a spot that you can’t be bothered getting out of like in the middle of the ocean or something, but as a mechanic that actually elevates the options you have in the game, doing game stuff, like getting into chases and cop fights and whatnot, it is lacking. 

I dunno what to say about the cops if you like them spawning all over then I guess that works for you, for me though it ruins the immersion to have cops spawn randomly. In GTA 4 you can actually hear on the police radio where they are being dispatched from and the cops actually spawn coming from the direction of that neighbourhood. You can strategically avoid them this way if you want, or just go right at them. It’s true that it is not realistic for one man to fight off an entire force but it’s still a game and it’s all about balance, and in V the cops have godly levels of accuracy. They still hit me even when I’m speeding down the street at 100mph in a sports car and swerving through traffic. Not even joking. 

As for online, I think it started out quite good, but it became awful as they added more and more crap to it that just made it a convoluted mess. And don’t even get me started on all the stupid futuristic bullshit they added. No wonder Dan Houser and Leslie Benzies have both left Rockstar.
                            >The physics of vehicles are different but I meant the physics thathappen when you crash, in IV you fly out the windscreen and the carbuckles under the impact.

Damn i definitely need to check it out again.  Definitely never saw those drug and gang missions but im all about it. I remember loving the gang wars of San Andreas lol.

I hear you about the cops too, now I'm excited to go back and try that. As much fun as it is fucking with them in the wilderness, it's equally as fun to lose them in a legit chase in the city, which is probably better if they don't spawn everywhere. I'm probably going to be a menace in Liberty city since I'm used to the perfect aiming robot cops of V.

I agree online is a mess now. I quit playing around when those flying bikes and CEO missions started. It's all about the money and selling shark cards for rockstar, which is sad.

Benzies and Houser leaving is probably the beginning of the end, unfortunately. Will always love the series though. Right from GTA 1 and London I was hooked.

Anyway, you've convinced me I need to get a gta IV complete edition. Can probably find a disc copy for like $20
Gta 4 already runs like shit on PC with even high specs, I can't even begin to imagine how bad grove street games would butcher it.
    Install the Vulkan wrapper. Works brilliant.
    nah, they're already fixed it tho, running fine on my potato laptop
        Yes it is also runing "fine" on my laptop  on lower settings, but i still cant max it out on my pc and that just shouldn't be a thing with a 13 years old game
            Tried DXVK? Worked wonders for me.
            Unmodded it's really not *graphically* intensive at all by today's standards, TBH. Just rather CPU-bound.
    That was its earlier versions. With the new patches it runs pretty good actually.
And the dumbasses will say it's meant to look like that because it's meant to be cartoony...Completely overlooking how the game tried to be realistic and grounded.
    I am a new player, but how so?

Half Life 2 was released at the same time as San Andreas, and still looks decent to this day.

Call of Duty 2 is from 2005, and it looks ages above SA.

So I think they weren't trying to make them overly realistic.
        I was talking about what would happen if they released a remaster of IV with those kind of character models too, using the same stupid excuse of making things cartoony.

But to awnser your point: It's not exactly a fair comparison since none of these games have even half the amount of content that San Andreas alone had.

Resident Evil 4 character models are far more detailed and and realistic than SA had too, but RE4 and none of the other games you mentioned had over 200 driveable vehicles, none of them had over 100 licensed songs that played on the radio, they didn't had a customizable main character, they didn't had over 30 different kinds of minigames and side missions, and more importantly they didn't had a fully open, explorable and fleshed out open world that looked alive.
        It's because of limitations of the engine and the scope of the game.  Theres a reason games like GTA look inferior to Call of Duty and Half-Life 2.

Call of Duty has small contained maps for each mission that have to load individually and the same goes for HL2.  GTA SA had a large map that had to have the whole world available all at once and tried at it best to make it look good as well.  It's the same reason why MMOs don't look as good as other games as well.
GTA 4 wAs alWaYs CaRtOony
    none of the older games looked cartoony either. The only reason they look “cartoony” was because the graphics didn’t age well by today’s standards
They better not touch 4.

It’s Perfect the way it is
    At least a PS5 port would be fine
        They need to make a **new** game, not running off of nostalgia for these series
            Now they've lost Benzies and Houser, I actually think that all I'm now hoping for from them in the rest of their lifetime as a company is some really solid modern remakes of GTAIII-SA, Episodes x2, and the complete GTAIV.

I'd rather have premium fully made slices of the past than a GTAVI targeted at the Shark Card market and made without the involvement of the people who helped make the previous games so enduring.
                Agree 100%

It’s like new Beatles music without any of the Beatles.
    You must not play PC. It's infamous for being a large, buggy disaster on PC. Because whatever port they made sucks. And apparently I read it just keeps performing worse with newer hardware for some ungodly reason.
        It runs a little worse than a game from 2008 should, yeah, but otherwise is definitely a better experience than the original PS3 version was, as it can do 60+ FPS at your resolution of choice.
    I wouldn’t mind a 60 FPS upscale.
    [deleted]
        I'd say they should improve the performance and upgrade some textures and lighting, that's all. they shouldn't touch the models or the physics or anything.
            [deleted]
                console brothers cant mod it sadly
        The pc graphics with 60 FPS on next gen is acceptable
    For PS players, PS3 is the only option...all it needs is a resolution bump for PS4/PS5.
    It is far from perfect on pc, but i definitely dont want them, to butcher it even further

“It’s supposed to be a cartoonish art style!”
The problem with the trilogy is the low quality, they didn't change art styles at all. It seems some people don't know why others are upset with Rockstar here and are just jumping on a bandwagon.
And people will claim it was always supposed to look cartoony
Lol I think GTA 4 DE will not better than GTA Trilogy DE. Rockstar going to be lazy and greedy. I hope Rockstar will fix something.

Niko! Cousin, lez go bow-ling!! You drive!
I love it so far, great remaster thanks Rockstar!
Kinda like it ngl
I’m okay with this.
Please don’t make me cry because this can be a reality given what happened with the definitive edition lol.
For GTA 4 Remastered it would be really expensive that’s why think it’ll never happen
    It may actually happen. Rockstar and Take2 are going after modders that modded GTA 4, just like when they went after modders for the original trilogy before announcing the definitive edition.

That shit is too funny 🤣 Only because it's so probable.
You do realise the early gta games went for a cartoony look, while gta 4 was the first to go for realism?
    They weren’t cartoony that’s just how games used to look. They were actually realistic at the time.
You're being too nice
Nah nah see this actually looks good. It looks like the artist was given time to reinterpret it into a new style while keeping detail. Please make it look like a freeware iPhone game thanks

This game has literally become a meme hahahahah this is brilliant
Fuck sake I register bereavements on the phone and just laugh because of this
I might be in the extreme minority but I was completely fine with them making the old games stylized but it was just not done well, at all. The realistic environments with cartoony af characters is just weird. So many games old game remasters did stylization well; Fable, Even WoW made great visual upgrades over the years. Fuck it man just  even make it like Fortnite. Anything would be better than that mess. How can a remaster of a series of games, the newest being in 2006 look worse.
hhhhhhhhhhhh im done
NAA that looks well done
Why isn’t GTA IV available on ps store? I really want to play it now. I hade high hope for the remastered versions… but it’s the worst shit I have ever seen. I want to play IV before it’s to late. 

If this is the new Rockstar GTA six is doomed.
    You have only ever been able to play it on PS3 for some strange reason
        because the ps3 was notoriously hard to port games to or from, ~~it had something weird to do with it's memory and ram and graphics in the way they all connected and streamed data to each other~~. and so most companies never bothered with it once they had a game functioning properly on the ps3, that's why a ton of PS2 classics weren't really Backwards compatible, and why nearly NO ps3 games are compatible with the PS4.

the ps3 was essentially a Frankenstein's monster of hardware that the crack heads at Sony somehow managed to get to work together, but because of their wizardry it made it incredibly difficult to do anything with.

EDIT: the PS3 was difficult to develop for because of the way it's CPU, GPU, and memory worked together, whereas in theory it was relative powerhouse (some estimates put it's processing power above that of the Xbox 360), but because the CPU was one main CPU and then 7 smaller "floating" CPUs it made deving for it a pain. because instead of the "floating CPUs being able to pull directly from the ram, they had to go through the main CPU in order to access the ram, but if a game was programmed correctly and took advantage of that (as quite a few larger titles did) then it would run better than the 360. but a lot of smaller devs, or even a lot of larger but lazy devs I.E. bethesda, just didn't bother trying to optimize their code and therefor a lot of other games ran like crap on the ps3.
    Gta IV has been backwards compatible on Xbox One and One X, with loading and framerate improvements. I don't know why they never got it over on PS4, but you'd think it could be a PS Now title like Red Dead Redemption
    you have to find a physical copy on Playstation now, unless you have previously purchased it on there. I think sony went a bit crazy when the trilogy released and took down those games as well as GTA 4 just to be "safe"
IM FUCKING DONE
I didn’t know Niko Bellic was an option in Civ VI.

This looks like that character from that one gta clone on playstore i played once lol its was called gangstar new orleans or something
    For real, there are also two better gta mobile clones from the same company like: Gangstar Vegas and G. Rio, and the characters in these copycats look better in a way then some in the gta "definitive" edition, which says enough as they're old mobile gta clones, and some pretty good ones, seriously Rockstar should have worked with Gameloft to remaster the trilogy, I'm sure they would've done a better job
        They also have a new one i checked its called gangstar New York honestly doesn't look that bad either i think they would have done a much better job remastering the trilogy than the other company
Already secured a GTA IV copy from Steam. Eagerly waiting for someone to remove the DRM from the stupid R* launcher
    not going to happen because nobody cares enough about cockstars launcher to do anything with it. plus it has it's dumbass "phone home" thing where it CONSTANTLY has to have a connection to their servers in order for you to launch their games through it. and if yo try to fuck with that feature then either it will "fix" itself or it will just refuse to function. the only way I have found around it is to download cracked versions of their games, then they somehow skip over the launcher feature and just directly launch from the .exe like a fucking game should.

I dont know if this is making fun of the definitely shitty job Rockstar has done with the trilogy, but while everyone is having a brickshit with them, I think it's safe to say it's been flying over the masses heads that Rockstar is probably having their less talented people work on that while they put their best people on GTA6. Hopefully... They fucking better be lol
    they'll probably leave the last 2 years of development to the crackheads they find on the street corner on the way to work because it's "more profitable"

    Me too after the Definitive edition nonsense, but is it really so much to ask for actual remakes of all of Rockstar's main GTA series? I mean, it seems stupid that they're going cheap on what will absolutely be their biggest cultural impact ever. You'd think they'd respect their own history enough to do them properly.

What they've done is taken their golden goose and cooked it for a short term profit, rather than exploiting those golden eggs for years to come.

I guess they don't care because it gave them GTA Online, something that gives them a stream of solid cash... for now. But they'll one day find out that if they keep upsetting their fanbase, people might eventually lose interest in the series.
        They could have made full on remakes for each of those games and sell them as standalones. And if it was made using the GTA5 engine they could use the new assets they made for GTA online as well.
        People are _right now_ losing interest in their series.  My friends and I are peeved enough to turn our noses up at GTA 6 should it ever materialize.

Which it won’t.  Rockstar’s (glory and reputation) days are over.  Dan Hauser and Leslie Benzies left their companies in the hands of greedy lawyers.
        It's not Rockstar's Fault. Nor is is it the Developers themselves faults. The fault for the trilogy lies with Take Two's Executives. Take Two Executives have decided that Short Term profits far exceed Long time Profit, whose end will lead to extremely cheaply made games, that will ultimately cause Take Two's Executive Board to virtually Annihilate Rockstar as a Gaming Development Company. Take Two bought out Rockstar, and Rockstar went into Studio Decline after Dan Houser left. There is no original Gaming studio of the PS2 era left with Rockstar or most other companies. Those companies, have new executives, with more greed then sense, and more young developers who want only a paycheck and comfortable job and care little for their Content. This has been happening not just in the Gaming Industry of the U.S, but since 1991, with the end of the cold war, All Industries in the US and Worldwide have went from Product Oriented (has QC, etc.) To Service Oriented (lack of QC, etc.). Don't blame the creative talent for their lack of work. They were explicitly told by the Exec's to not deliver the Remaster we wanted. They couldn't go over their hourly or salary wage. Else they'd lose their job. This is how this industry works. I utterly hate it, when people hate on the wrong man, just trying to make his way in life.
    I would love a straight up gta iv next gen patch or version. Just graphics and resolution improvements.

The series x version (backwards compatibility) runs really good, only downside it still runs the 360 resolution at 720p.

I agree though last thing i would want is GSG "improving" it.
        still looks incredible on higher resolutions. playing it right now on the dog shit PC port but it runs stable enough to enjoy it
            Does it run any better after they removed the "games for windows" or whatever it was?  
I recall it being a bit choppy before.
                Yes and No I guess. I remember before they got rid of that I always had trouble just logging in to the fucking game in the first place so if that's what your issue was then yeah that's gone but they just replaced it with the social club launcher the asshats, but my PC is from 2014 and it runs it at like 50 FPS mostly consistently when in the city and fluid indoors so as long as you don't have an ooga booga caveman pc it should run adequately.

There's supposedly this method of adding this Linux file to your .exe folder thats supposed to double your framerate but I followed the install guide to the letter and it took my FPS down to 5 or 7 when outdoors but fluid 60 indoors

PC games during that whole games for windows live era really got fucked I hope whoever came up with that shit is sleeping with the fishes
                    There is a Vulkan wrapper available that fixes performance on GTAIV if you have a decent machine. I went from a stuttery 10-20 fps mess to 60+ fps buttery smoothness after installing it this past weekend.
                        That's the one I was referring to.  The two .dll files you put into your exe folder?I used the guide on the front page of the store on steam. it just made me performance tank
                    I had an i5 (6th gen) and 1050ti at the time, I think. GTA5 ran ok with those cpu/gpu, but GTA4 didn't seem to.
                        like I said it's a dog shit port regardless of the external issues.
    I would like it to be optimized for current generations, an example is resident evil 4 and 5, both are very old games but optimized to play at 1080p and 60fps. I'd really love to see that with GTA 4 because the game is perfect as is but the graphics feel a little odd.
    Adding the Rockstar Editor would be nice, plus not completely removing all audio when you capture clips (like backward compatible IV does).
    That would be cool. But I would prefer the PS5 just being backwards compatible with the pre-PS4 console games.
I recently got it on a Xbox sale a few weeks ago before the "Definitive" trilogy collection came out. I didn't have the Xbox 360 or PS3 till the very end of both it's life cycles in 2013 and by that time I was playing GTA V and just missed out on it really.

I regret not getting a used copy for cheap or just downloading it after all these years, but to my surprise I found out it was backwards compatible with the series XS and Xbox one so I've been playing it this week and it has been such an amazing experience and I wish I could go back in time to 2008 and actually play it when it came out. I love the atmosphere of liberty city, Niko is such a great protagonist and I absolutely love cousin Roman lol.
    I’m loving it too. I did not touch video games for about 5 years. Then played gta 3 for about 2 months (my previous favorite game). Remembered I had IV on Xbox 360 and played it for a bit. Was blown away. Today I upgraded to a series s and bought IV. What a masterpiece. It plays extremely well with no dropped frames (my Xbox 360 experience was poor - lots of frame drops and poor graphics). It’s such an upgrade from GTA 3 (my favorite game) and feels like the first time I played GTA 3. Very happy now :) , sorry for the rambling.

    Seeing how they delisted old copies of 3, VC and SA (There goes my dream of seeing them on GOG), it's reasonable to assume they'd delis the original 4, if it was ever "improved".

All this delisting achieves is promote piracy.
I dunno the driving is garbage, the water looks terrible, there's definitely some good upgrades that could be done by a real game studio.
    > the driving is garbage

False.  It is just not the arcade style of the other games in the series.
Pretty weird choice for a favourite game...
    What do you mean? It’s a great fucking game the gameplay is great , physics are more realistic than most games even today and the multiplayer in its prime was epic. Playing full lobby cops n crooks is still the most fun I’ve had in any multiplayer game to this day
        Physics doesn't make a game, fun gameplay does which gta 4 lacked imo but whatever.
            Why is it you keep chasing after people who loves IV in this thread?
There’s already rumors that they’ll be remastering IV, lost and damned, and ballad of gay Tony. I personally look forward to it
Welp they putting their hands back on it 😭
I'm seriously tempted to get a disc version for GTA IV and RDR just in case R* continues with their shit.
    You can just pirate them
        Well rdr can't be pirated on pc

            It  can be, but it still has terrible performance.
    I never got rid of mine haha
    RDR can still be downloaded on xbox. It even runs in 4K if you have an xbox x (1440p on series s, i think)
    Bought a 360 copy of RDR goty for this reason even though i don't have a xbox at this time.
GTA 1 and 2? Liberty and Vice City stories?
    Yeah well, you know, not many people are thinking about those ones. I like the stories games though, but they get overlooked
        Especially VCS, easily the best 3d universe game overall
            VCS is like a rarity these days. You’d be forgiven for not even knowing it existed. Can’t even buy it on the store. I would like to play it again on the Vita (yes, I still have a Vita)
                VCS is so far, the only GTA game exculsive to Playstation, since It can only be played on the PSP and PS2. Imo, It deserves a re-release
    He said after 3
Gta 4 graphics still holds up. Dont remaster that if you turn the game into shit.
    And it plays in glorious 60fps on newer Xbox consoles.
They did release that one update just to strip songs out of the game.  And the game launched with something like seven forms of DRM that will make it progressively harder to play over the years.
    Thank fuck I have the PS3 original. They can’t take songs from me haha. Perks of being a console player
GTA4 on PC had that god awful games for Windows live DRM.
You do realize that GTA 3, VC and SA still exist in a dozen or so other formats, right?  

None of them have been "ruined" by the remasters if they still exist.  Just because you can't legit buy them digitally any more doesn't mean there aren't a bunch of ways to obtain them, both physically and digitally.
LMAO. What about GTA LCS, GTA VCS, GTA, GTA II, GTA London, GTA Advance, GTA CTW?
    Edited original comment 👍
        Your comment is still incorrect because GTA CTW would not be considered a spin off.
            It is a spinoff
                No it's not. It takes place in the HD universe between GTA IV and GTA V. Sure it has elements that take place in the GTA IV triad storyline but you wouldn't have needed to have played GTA IV first to understand what is going on and the story stands on it's own two feet. In fact the connection is so small, it's more like an easter egg than an actual main plotline. It isn't like GTA LCS where a minor character is given their own game.

And even though it has connections to GTA IV and GTA V...going by that logic, all GTA games are spin-offs of each other and therefore your comment still wouldn't make sense.
                    It’s still a spinoff of the HD games just like GTA Advance was a spinoff of the 3D games. It isn’t even acknowledged in V at all. 

And what makes Huang Lee any better than Tony? Huang was just a random name on the police database in GTA 4…talk about minor character. 

My comment makes perfect sense hence why it is upvoted as much as it is. Sorry buddy.
                        Okay then. Let's just agree to disagree and call it even.
Gta 4 was already ruined by poor optimization, bland story, wannabe "realistic" driving, cut content from SA and repetitive missions. No wonder it got so much criticism when it released. Rockstar doesn't even acknowledge it's existence lmao.
    Poor optimizaion is literally the only part of your comment that's applicable, the rest are all subject to opinion
        And that was only on the PC. On console it ran fine
        Repetitive missions and no variety.... anyone who has played it even once would know but yeah sure.
            [deleted]
                Gta 5 was the exact opposite of being repetitive. Every mission was unique so I don't know how anyone could think otherwise. You may not like the game but the game is anything but repetitive.
                    let me rephrase my answer.

in my opinion gta5 didn't really sit right with me, firstly the humour felt forced and they went for more over the top gameplay than in gta4. My second point is that the story didn't feel as coherent in 5 than it did in 4 and for that reason I couldn't really connect with the characters, whereas in gta4 you get somewhat attached to certain characters such as roman for example.

Finally due to the realism in gta4 you understand the meaning of the game.

Sure gta5 is more comprehensive in terms of a sandbox game but in terms of story gta4 outdoes it.
                        This

I gave uo GTA V's story, Its honestly one of the weaker ones in the series
                            the cycle of trevor hating michael was extremely repetitive and i remember getting really sick and tired of it by the end
                                I completed only past the first heist and i felt burned out alr.

Its that bad imo
    Lol Good one. Go to any GTA 4 vs 5 video and look at the comments. Try not to cry 😢
        Only a clown would take youtube comments seriously. Moreover the vocal majority doesn't count. More people love and play gta 5 and that's what matters. Gta 4 toxic players verbally abuse other players and spew venom in the youtube comments sections. I'm sure you are one of those people who'd trash gta 6 when it comes out and suddenly start praising gta 5.
            Hey  clown look at your downvotes and sit down boy, your   opinion is wrong and that's a fact. Now be quiet, the grown ups are talking.
            now go home and take your sharkcards
                It's as if you didn't even read what I wrote. Well...can't expect much from folks like you. Can't even take folks like you seriously.
                    nostalgic?...bruh i play gta v first before i went to gta iv
            Lol…I guess you cried 😂. The only people playing GTA V are the brainless losers buying Shark cards lmao.
            Meh, only a clown would also take your Reddit comments seriously too 🤷‍♂️
How did shitty online ruin GTA 5 ? I think it was additive (in a shitty way that I didn't really buy into) but I don't really think it *detracted* from the single player experience. I think GTA 5 was the peak of the series cause it was largely the same as IV but the superior SA map and vehicles made free roaming and fucking around more fun. The story was kinda shit but there were still some really good missions.
    5 single player was lackluster
        I agree the story was lackluster. I still think the missions had some great moments. Also, what about the other SP stuff: the free roam, the map, the stunt jumps, mowing down cows in slow-mo cinematic view ? Mt. chilliad with 4 stars ? military base ? big shitty dump trucks, parking a bunch of busses in front of the LRT, off roading in raton canyon ? 

None of that does anything for you ?
            All that stuff is fine, 5 is far from a bad game it’s just a weak GTA game. It’s the most boring map of the series for me, and the country is just pure wasted space. How many times can you do an off road race? Or attack the military base? It doesn’t keep you engaged especially when the gameplay just feels lacking, the shooting mechanics are boring and lack oomph, guns sound really weak, being able to carry all weapons removes any balance, the driving requires no real skill or thought so chases are less compelling, the physics are downgraded so crashes are just boring. It’s missing a lot of side missions that are crime based too. 

In GTA 4 you have Jacob’s drug deliveries, Brucie’s car thefts, Stevie’s car thefts, the most wanted, and later the Assassinations, all of these can result in unscripted emergent gameplay moments because they are built into the world organically, so gangs and cops can interfere. They also all feel like things Niko would actually do. Add the two DLC’s and you have the amazing Gang and Drug Wars, yet more vehicle thefts, and those epic vehicle Triathlons with nitro. They feel more connected to the world. 

5’s side activities just feel dropped in there for the sake of having content. Lester has less assassinations, and they’re all scripted to hell, no gang wars of any kind. It barely even feels like there are gangs in the game. Franklin needed some gang wars at least. Trevor could’ve had meth heads and rural gangs attacking his cook house etc. Instead he gets a pitiful four bounty missions. I liked them a lot, why just 4?? Should have been twice that at least. It’s like they legit ran out of dev time or couldn’t be bothered. Trevor does have drug drops at his airport, but they are also very scripted so the emergent gameplay potential is lost. Even hanging out in 5 with the other protagonists is crap, why can’t you switch characters? That was the big selling point of the game!! Imagine the trouble you could get up to if you could switch between them and strategically place them about. And this doesn’t even work in missions where they are together as they just go back to a predetermined spot and select their own weapon. It is just bad, eliminates any strategy and shows that the switch mechanic and mission design is poorly thought out. 

And the cops AI…it is the worst in the series by far, they literally spawn on the side of the mountain if you’re up there, and have inhuman aiming abilities so fights are just not that fun because you just get absolutely swarmed by cops spawning off screen.
                Thanks for the reply. I think your points about lack of trevor-rural gang missions, and complete absence of Franklin gang-activity are very solid and to your point, probably can be explained by the focus on online development. The off road races *were* garbage and way too easy. I never did them all. When I say offroading i'm just referring to souping up a pickup and doin my own thing. I never noticed vehicle physics being any worse than before and still enjoy destroying vehicles, are they downgraded from IV ? True that the military base isn't great, and when you finally do get away successfully with a tank, it blows up way too easy. They put a lot of work into that base though which is kind of a shame actually.

I'm not sure Niko would hang out with a guy like Brucie lol and I can't actually remember those other side missions. I will have to play IV again cause it's been a while. I played gay tony and L&D and those were great but I never checked out gang and drug wars so maybe I have some homework.

You *can* switch characters, just not while wanted. I never considered the idea you could use that strategically if it was executed better, but good point. I always just used it when I got sick of a character or got stranded. I was glad to have the option in those cases.

I enjoyed the 5 assassinations, especially the stock market manipulation aspect. It feels scripted for sure, but what's not to like about blowing the lifeintruder CEO's face apart with a cell phone bomb, from the comfort of micheals living room ? 

Cop AI *was* kinda shitty. Worst in the series? maybe. again, I have to play IV again. I know they are still fun to fuck around with. I thoroughly enjoy spawning cops on top of mountains, so I thought that makes up for the inconvenience of them spawning where they don't make sense to spawn. They are super difficult in GTA 5 above 3 stars, so I usually just chill with 2-3. I think that's realistic though given that it's generally pretty easy for a police force to fuck up one guy if they really need to.

I was also pretty happy with most of the humor of the game being in line with what I expected from the series. They still lambast the corporations and consumerism. I'm really concerned they will lose sight of this aspect soon but I think 5 hit the mark still. 

For what it's worth, I didn't actually *hate* online either. The big bank heist was decent but the load times, hackers, and mission grinding kinda wrecked it for me. I would much rather have had them put all that online effort into SP but overall I think 5 will be the last great one. 6 should be great given how long it's taking but I suspect they will go even harder into the online, pay to play aspects.
                    Sure getting in a buggy and doing some off roading is fun I won’t deny that, but it’s not enough I don’t think. The map feels largely unused outside of the city. The physics of vehicles are different but I meant the physics that happen when you crash, in IV you fly out the windscreen and the car buckles under the impact. If you crash a bike you go over the handlebars at the speed you crashed and literally soar through the air. You really feel the crashes in IV, in V they are nerfed to the point that car deformation is severely cut back and the crashes themselves lack impact. 

Niko would definitely hang out with Brucie, if you listen to their dialogues it becomes clear just why their friendship works despite them being polar opposites. The gang and drug wars are probably the best side missions in the entire GTA IV saga, they are simply pure GTA. Rolling up on a crew in a blacked out SUV, shooting the place up and fucking off with their coke slung over your back while the cops chase you… it doesn’t get more GTA than that. 

I meant switch characters in V when you are hanging out with the other two. You can get all three of them to hang out, but you can’t switch you are stuck with the one who initiates the hang out. The switch is ok in free roam  if you find yourself in a spot that you can’t be bothered getting out of like in the middle of the ocean or something, but as a mechanic that actually elevates the options you have in the game, doing game stuff, like getting into chases and cop fights and whatnot, it is lacking. 

I dunno what to say about the cops if you like them spawning all over then I guess that works for you, for me though it ruins the immersion to have cops spawn randomly. In GTA 4 you can actually hear on the police radio where they are being dispatched from and the cops actually spawn coming from the direction of that neighbourhood. You can strategically avoid them this way if you want, or just go right at them. It’s true that it is not realistic for one man to fight off an entire force but it’s still a game and it’s all about balance, and in V the cops have godly levels of accuracy. They still hit me even when I’m speeding down the street at 100mph in a sports car and swerving through traffic. Not even joking. 

As for online, I think it started out quite good, but it became awful as they added more and more crap to it that just made it a convoluted mess. And don’t even get me started on all the stupid futuristic bullshit they added. No wonder Dan Houser and Leslie Benzies have both left Rockstar.
                        >The physics of vehicles are different but I meant the physics thathappen when you crash, in IV you fly out the windscreen and the carbuckles under the impact.

Damn i definitely need to check it out again.  Definitely never saw those drug and gang missions but im all about it. I remember loving the gang wars of San Andreas lol.

I hear you about the cops too, now I'm excited to go back and try that. As much fun as it is fucking with them in the wilderness, it's equally as fun to lose them in a legit chase in the city, which is probably better if they don't spawn everywhere. I'm probably going to be a menace in Liberty city since I'm used to the perfect aiming robot cops of V.

I agree online is a mess now. I quit playing around when those flying bikes and CEO missions started. It's all about the money and selling shark cards for rockstar, which is sad.

Benzies and Houser leaving is probably the beginning of the end, unfortunately. Will always love the series though. Right from GTA 1 and London I was hooked.

Anyway, you've convinced me I need to get a gta IV complete edition. Can probably find a disc copy for like $20
Install the Vulkan wrapper. Works brilliant.
nah, they're already fixed it tho, running fine on my potato laptop
    Yes it is also runing "fine" on my laptop  on lower settings, but i still cant max it out on my pc and that just shouldn't be a thing with a 13 years old game
        Tried DXVK? Worked wonders for me.
        Unmodded it's really not *graphically* intensive at all by today's standards, TBH. Just rather CPU-bound.
That was its earlier versions. With the new patches it runs pretty good actually.
I am a new player, but how so?

Half Life 2 was released at the same time as San Andreas, and still looks decent to this day.

Call of Duty 2 is from 2005, and it looks ages above SA.

So I think they weren't trying to make them overly realistic.
    I was talking about what would happen if they released a remaster of IV with those kind of character models too, using the same stupid excuse of making things cartoony.

But to awnser your point: It's not exactly a fair comparison since none of these games have even half the amount of content that San Andreas alone had.

Resident Evil 4 character models are far more detailed and and realistic than SA had too, but RE4 and none of the other games you mentioned had over 200 driveable vehicles, none of them had over 100 licensed songs that played on the radio, they didn't had a customizable main character, they didn't had over 30 different kinds of minigames and side missions, and more importantly they didn't had a fully open, explorable and fleshed out open world that looked alive.
    It's because of limitations of the engine and the scope of the game.  Theres a reason games like GTA look inferior to Call of Duty and Half-Life 2.

Call of Duty has small contained maps for each mission that have to load individually and the same goes for HL2.  GTA SA had a large map that had to have the whole world available all at once and tried at it best to make it look good as well.  It's the same reason why MMOs don't look as good as other games as well.
none of the older games looked cartoony either. The only reason they look “cartoony” was because the graphics didn’t age well by today’s standards
At least a PS5 port would be fine
    They need to make a **new** game, not running off of nostalgia for these series
        Now they've lost Benzies and Houser, I actually think that all I'm now hoping for from them in the rest of their lifetime as a company is some really solid modern remakes of GTAIII-SA, Episodes x2, and the complete GTAIV.

I'd rather have premium fully made slices of the past than a GTAVI targeted at the Shark Card market and made without the involvement of the people who helped make the previous games so enduring.
            Agree 100%

It’s like new Beatles music without any of the Beatles.
You must not play PC. It's infamous for being a large, buggy disaster on PC. Because whatever port they made sucks. And apparently I read it just keeps performing worse with newer hardware for some ungodly reason.
    It runs a little worse than a game from 2008 should, yeah, but otherwise is definitely a better experience than the original PS3 version was, as it can do 60+ FPS at your resolution of choice.
I wouldn’t mind a 60 FPS upscale.
[deleted]
    I'd say they should improve the performance and upgrade some textures and lighting, that's all. they shouldn't touch the models or the physics or anything.
        [deleted]
            console brothers cant mod it sadly
    The pc graphics with 60 FPS on next gen is acceptable
For PS players, PS3 is the only option...all it needs is a resolution bump for PS4/PS5.
It is far from perfect on pc, but i definitely dont want them, to butcher it even further
Thats probably close to his theortical name of Nikolaj Bellic or something that fits in closer with his croatian serbian heritage
    I wrote an Armenian version of his name, cuz that Niko looks like 111% stereotypo Armenian
cousin let's go blowing
needs to look like the original toy story for it to be a rockstar "remaster"
    LOL
It may actually happen. Rockstar and Take2 are going after modders that modded GTA 4, just like when they went after modders for the original trilogy before announcing the definitive edition.
I think when they did it, there would at least be less bugs
They weren’t cartoony that’s just how games used to look. They were actually realistic at the time.
Babooshka ja, ja!
You have only ever been able to play it on PS3 for some strange reason
    because the ps3 was notoriously hard to port games to or from, ~~it had something weird to do with it's memory and ram and graphics in the way they all connected and streamed data to each other~~. and so most companies never bothered with it once they had a game functioning properly on the ps3, that's why a ton of PS2 classics weren't really Backwards compatible, and why nearly NO ps3 games are compatible with the PS4.

the ps3 was essentially a Frankenstein's monster of hardware that the crack heads at Sony somehow managed to get to work together, but because of their wizardry it made it incredibly difficult to do anything with.

EDIT: the PS3 was difficult to develop for because of the way it's CPU, GPU, and memory worked together, whereas in theory it was relative powerhouse (some estimates put it's processing power above that of the Xbox 360), but because the CPU was one main CPU and then 7 smaller "floating" CPUs it made deving for it a pain. because instead of the "floating CPUs being able to pull directly from the ram, they had to go through the main CPU in order to access the ram, but if a game was programmed correctly and took advantage of that (as quite a few larger titles did) then it would run better than the 360. but a lot of smaller devs, or even a lot of larger but lazy devs I.E. bethesda, just didn't bother trying to optimize their code and therefor a lot of other games ran like crap on the ps3.
Gta IV has been backwards compatible on Xbox One and One X, with loading and framerate improvements. I don't know why they never got it over on PS4, but you'd think it could be a PS Now title like Red Dead Redemption
you have to find a physical copy on Playstation now, unless you have previously purchased it on there. I think sony went a bit crazy when the trilogy released and took down those games as well as GTA 4 just to be "safe"
For real, there are also two better gta mobile clones from the same company like: Gangstar Vegas and G. Rio, and the characters in these copycats look better in a way then some in the gta "definitive" edition, which says enough as they're old mobile gta clones, and some pretty good ones, seriously Rockstar should have worked with Gameloft to remaster the trilogy, I'm sure they would've done a better job
    They also have a new one i checked its called gangstar New York honestly doesn't look that bad either i think they would have done a much better job remastering the trilogy than the other company
not going to happen because nobody cares enough about cockstars launcher to do anything with it. plus it has it's dumbass "phone home" thing where it CONSTANTLY has to have a connection to their servers in order for you to launch their games through it. and if yo try to fuck with that feature then either it will "fix" itself or it will just refuse to function. the only way I have found around it is to download cracked versions of their games, then they somehow skip over the launcher feature and just directly launch from the .exe like a fucking game should.
they'll probably leave the last 2 years of development to the crackheads they find on the street corner on the way to work because it's "more profitable"
This has me dying
For “Going Bowling”
A game were you kill all the rats in level 1 as that old grandma in “ratatouille: origins”
    Ok
        I would pay all the money I have for a game like that
Kena: Bridge of Spirits was made by a team of former animators... Not Pixar level, but the same idea.
Disney Infinity?
I just want some optimization patches and I'm good
Me too after the Definitive edition nonsense, but is it really so much to ask for actual remakes of all of Rockstar's main GTA series? I mean, it seems stupid that they're going cheap on what will absolutely be their biggest cultural impact ever. You'd think they'd respect their own history enough to do them properly.

What they've done is taken their golden goose and cooked it for a short term profit, rather than exploiting those golden eggs for years to come.

I guess they don't care because it gave them GTA Online, something that gives them a stream of solid cash... for now. But they'll one day find out that if they keep upsetting their fanbase, people might eventually lose interest in the series.
    They could have made full on remakes for each of those games and sell them as standalones. And if it was made using the GTA5 engine they could use the new assets they made for GTA online as well.
    People are _right now_ losing interest in their series.  My friends and I are peeved enough to turn our noses up at GTA 6 should it ever materialize.

Which it won’t.  Rockstar’s (glory and reputation) days are over.  Dan Hauser and Leslie Benzies left their companies in the hands of greedy lawyers.
    It's not Rockstar's Fault. Nor is is it the Developers themselves faults. The fault for the trilogy lies with Take Two's Executives. Take Two Executives have decided that Short Term profits far exceed Long time Profit, whose end will lead to extremely cheaply made games, that will ultimately cause Take Two's Executive Board to virtually Annihilate Rockstar as a Gaming Development Company. Take Two bought out Rockstar, and Rockstar went into Studio Decline after Dan Houser left. There is no original Gaming studio of the PS2 era left with Rockstar or most other companies. Those companies, have new executives, with more greed then sense, and more young developers who want only a paycheck and comfortable job and care little for their Content. This has been happening not just in the Gaming Industry of the U.S, but since 1991, with the end of the cold war, All Industries in the US and Worldwide have went from Product Oriented (has QC, etc.) To Service Oriented (lack of QC, etc.). Don't blame the creative talent for their lack of work. They were explicitly told by the Exec's to not deliver the Remaster we wanted. They couldn't go over their hourly or salary wage. Else they'd lose their job. This is how this industry works. I utterly hate it, when people hate on the wrong man, just trying to make his way in life.
I would love a straight up gta iv next gen patch or version. Just graphics and resolution improvements.

The series x version (backwards compatibility) runs really good, only downside it still runs the 360 resolution at 720p.

I agree though last thing i would want is GSG "improving" it.
    still looks incredible on higher resolutions. playing it right now on the dog shit PC port but it runs stable enough to enjoy it
        Does it run any better after they removed the "games for windows" or whatever it was?  
I recall it being a bit choppy before.
            Yes and No I guess. I remember before they got rid of that I always had trouble just logging in to the fucking game in the first place so if that's what your issue was then yeah that's gone but they just replaced it with the social club launcher the asshats, but my PC is from 2014 and it runs it at like 50 FPS mostly consistently when in the city and fluid indoors so as long as you don't have an ooga booga caveman pc it should run adequately.

There's supposedly this method of adding this Linux file to your .exe folder thats supposed to double your framerate but I followed the install guide to the letter and it took my FPS down to 5 or 7 when outdoors but fluid 60 indoors

PC games during that whole games for windows live era really got fucked I hope whoever came up with that shit is sleeping with the fishes
                There is a Vulkan wrapper available that fixes performance on GTAIV if you have a decent machine. I went from a stuttery 10-20 fps mess to 60+ fps buttery smoothness after installing it this past weekend.
                    That's the one I was referring to.  The two .dll files you put into your exe folder?I used the guide on the front page of the store on steam. it just made me performance tank
                I had an i5 (6th gen) and 1050ti at the time, I think. GTA5 ran ok with those cpu/gpu, but GTA4 didn't seem to.
                    like I said it's a dog shit port regardless of the external issues.
I would like it to be optimized for current generations, an example is resident evil 4 and 5, both are very old games but optimized to play at 1080p and 60fps. I'd really love to see that with GTA 4 because the game is perfect as is but the graphics feel a little odd.
Adding the Rockstar Editor would be nice, plus not completely removing all audio when you capture clips (like backward compatible IV does).
That would be cool. But I would prefer the PS5 just being backwards compatible with the pre-PS4 console games.
I’m loving it too. I did not touch video games for about 5 years. Then played gta 3 for about 2 months (my previous favorite game). Remembered I had IV on Xbox 360 and played it for a bit. Was blown away. Today I upgraded to a series s and bought IV. What a masterpiece. It plays extremely well with no dropped frames (my Xbox 360 experience was poor - lots of frame drops and poor graphics). It’s such an upgrade from GTA 3 (my favorite game) and feels like the first time I played GTA 3. Very happy now :) , sorry for the rambling.
Seeing how they delisted old copies of 3, VC and SA (There goes my dream of seeing them on GOG), it's reasonable to assume they'd delis the original 4, if it was ever "improved".

All this delisting achieves is promote piracy.
> the driving is garbage

False.  It is just not the arcade style of the other games in the series.
What do you mean? It’s a great fucking game the gameplay is great , physics are more realistic than most games even today and the multiplayer in its prime was epic. Playing full lobby cops n crooks is still the most fun I’ve had in any multiplayer game to this day
    Physics doesn't make a game, fun gameplay does which gta 4 lacked imo but whatever.
        Why is it you keep chasing after people who loves IV in this thread?
You can just pirate them
    Well rdr can't be pirated on pc
        Sure it can, via PS3 emulator
        okay i can help with that  \[emulator\]([https://rpcs3.net/](https://rpcs3.net/))  \[firmware offical\]([https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/)) \[firmware alt link\]([https://www.techspot.com/drivers/driver/file/information/17026/](https://www.techspot.com/drivers/driver/file/information/17026/))  \[red dead\]([https://vimm.net/vault/25435](https://vimm.net/vault/25435))  \[dead red game of the year\]([https://vimm.net/vault/25436](https://vimm.net/vault/25436)) \[Red Dead Undead Nightmare\]([https://vimm.net/vault/25437](https://vimm.net/vault/25437))  \[help with Setup if needed\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNnicqO\_nqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNnicqO_nqk))
            woah thank you
                your welcome mate!
        It  can be, but it still has terrible performance.
I never got rid of mine haha
RDR can still be downloaded on xbox. It even runs in 4K if you have an xbox x (1440p on series s, i think)
Bought a 360 copy of RDR goty for this reason even though i don't have a xbox at this time.
Yeah well, you know, not many people are thinking about those ones. I like the stories games though, but they get overlooked
    Especially VCS, easily the best 3d universe game overall
        VCS is like a rarity these days. You’d be forgiven for not even knowing it existed. Can’t even buy it on the store. I would like to play it again on the Vita (yes, I still have a Vita)
            VCS is so far, the only GTA game exculsive to Playstation, since It can only be played on the PSP and PS2. Imo, It deserves a re-release
He said after 3
And it plays in glorious 60fps on newer Xbox consoles.
Thank fuck I have the PS3 original. They can’t take songs from me haha. Perks of being a console player
Edited original comment 👍
    Your comment is still incorrect because GTA CTW would not be considered a spin off.
        It is a spinoff
            No it's not. It takes place in the HD universe between GTA IV and GTA V. Sure it has elements that take place in the GTA IV triad storyline but you wouldn't have needed to have played GTA IV first to understand what is going on and the story stands on it's own two feet. In fact the connection is so small, it's more like an easter egg than an actual main plotline. It isn't like GTA LCS where a minor character is given their own game.

And even though it has connections to GTA IV and GTA V...going by that logic, all GTA games are spin-offs of each other and therefore your comment still wouldn't make sense.
                It’s still a spinoff of the HD games just like GTA Advance was a spinoff of the 3D games. It isn’t even acknowledged in V at all. 

And what makes Huang Lee any better than Tony? Huang was just a random name on the police database in GTA 4…talk about minor character. 

My comment makes perfect sense hence why it is upvoted as much as it is. Sorry buddy.
                    Okay then. Let's just agree to disagree and call it even.
Poor optimizaion is literally the only part of your comment that's applicable, the rest are all subject to opinion
    And that was only on the PC. On console it ran fine
    Repetitive missions and no variety.... anyone who has played it even once would know but yeah sure.
        [deleted]
            Gta 5 was the exact opposite of being repetitive. Every mission was unique so I don't know how anyone could think otherwise. You may not like the game but the game is anything but repetitive.
                let me rephrase my answer.

in my opinion gta5 didn't really sit right with me, firstly the humour felt forced and they went for more over the top gameplay than in gta4. My second point is that the story didn't feel as coherent in 5 than it did in 4 and for that reason I couldn't really connect with the characters, whereas in gta4 you get somewhat attached to certain characters such as roman for example.

Finally due to the realism in gta4 you understand the meaning of the game.

Sure gta5 is more comprehensive in terms of a sandbox game but in terms of story gta4 outdoes it.
                    This

I gave uo GTA V's story, Its honestly one of the weaker ones in the series
                        the cycle of trevor hating michael was extremely repetitive and i remember getting really sick and tired of it by the end
                            I completed only past the first heist and i felt burned out alr.

Its that bad imo
Lol Good one. Go to any GTA 4 vs 5 video and look at the comments. Try not to cry 😢
    Only a clown would take youtube comments seriously. Moreover the vocal majority doesn't count. More people love and play gta 5 and that's what matters. Gta 4 toxic players verbally abuse other players and spew venom in the youtube comments sections. I'm sure you are one of those people who'd trash gta 6 when it comes out and suddenly start praising gta 5.
        Hey  clown look at your downvotes and sit down boy, your   opinion is wrong and that's a fact. Now be quiet, the grown ups are talking.
        now go home and take your sharkcards
            It's as if you didn't even read what I wrote. Well...can't expect much from folks like you. Can't even take folks like you seriously.
                nostalgic?...bruh i play gta v first before i went to gta iv
        Lol…I guess you cried 😂. The only people playing GTA V are the brainless losers buying Shark cards lmao.
        Meh, only a clown would also take your Reddit comments seriously too 🤷‍♂️
5 single player was lackluster
    I agree the story was lackluster. I still think the missions had some great moments. Also, what about the other SP stuff: the free roam, the map, the stunt jumps, mowing down cows in slow-mo cinematic view ? Mt. chilliad with 4 stars ? military base ? big shitty dump trucks, parking a bunch of busses in front of the LRT, off roading in raton canyon ? 

None of that does anything for you ?
        All that stuff is fine, 5 is far from a bad game it’s just a weak GTA game. It’s the most boring map of the series for me, and the country is just pure wasted space. How many times can you do an off road race? Or attack the military base? It doesn’t keep you engaged especially when the gameplay just feels lacking, the shooting mechanics are boring and lack oomph, guns sound really weak, being able to carry all weapons removes any balance, the driving requires no real skill or thought so chases are less compelling, the physics are downgraded so crashes are just boring. It’s missing a lot of side missions that are crime based too. 

In GTA 4 you have Jacob’s drug deliveries, Brucie’s car thefts, Stevie’s car thefts, the most wanted, and later the Assassinations, all of these can result in unscripted emergent gameplay moments because they are built into the world organically, so gangs and cops can interfere. They also all feel like things Niko would actually do. Add the two DLC’s and you have the amazing Gang and Drug Wars, yet more vehicle thefts, and those epic vehicle Triathlons with nitro. They feel more connected to the world. 

5’s side activities just feel dropped in there for the sake of having content. Lester has less assassinations, and they’re all scripted to hell, no gang wars of any kind. It barely even feels like there are gangs in the game. Franklin needed some gang wars at least. Trevor could’ve had meth heads and rural gangs attacking his cook house etc. Instead he gets a pitiful four bounty missions. I liked them a lot, why just 4?? Should have been twice that at least. It’s like they legit ran out of dev time or couldn’t be bothered. Trevor does have drug drops at his airport, but they are also very scripted so the emergent gameplay potential is lost. Even hanging out in 5 with the other protagonists is crap, why can’t you switch characters? That was the big selling point of the game!! Imagine the trouble you could get up to if you could switch between them and strategically place them about. And this doesn’t even work in missions where they are together as they just go back to a predetermined spot and select their own weapon. It is just bad, eliminates any strategy and shows that the switch mechanic and mission design is poorly thought out. 

And the cops AI…it is the worst in the series by far, they literally spawn on the side of the mountain if you’re up there, and have inhuman aiming abilities so fights are just not that fun because you just get absolutely swarmed by cops spawning off screen.
            Thanks for the reply. I think your points about lack of trevor-rural gang missions, and complete absence of Franklin gang-activity are very solid and to your point, probably can be explained by the focus on online development. The off road races *were* garbage and way too easy. I never did them all. When I say offroading i'm just referring to souping up a pickup and doin my own thing. I never noticed vehicle physics being any worse than before and still enjoy destroying vehicles, are they downgraded from IV ? True that the military base isn't great, and when you finally do get away successfully with a tank, it blows up way too easy. They put a lot of work into that base though which is kind of a shame actually.

I'm not sure Niko would hang out with a guy like Brucie lol and I can't actually remember those other side missions. I will have to play IV again cause it's been a while. I played gay tony and L&D and those were great but I never checked out gang and drug wars so maybe I have some homework.

You *can* switch characters, just not while wanted. I never considered the idea you could use that strategically if it was executed better, but good point. I always just used it when I got sick of a character or got stranded. I was glad to have the option in those cases.

I enjoyed the 5 assassinations, especially the stock market manipulation aspect. It feels scripted for sure, but what's not to like about blowing the lifeintruder CEO's face apart with a cell phone bomb, from the comfort of micheals living room ? 

Cop AI *was* kinda shitty. Worst in the series? maybe. again, I have to play IV again. I know they are still fun to fuck around with. I thoroughly enjoy spawning cops on top of mountains, so I thought that makes up for the inconvenience of them spawning where they don't make sense to spawn. They are super difficult in GTA 5 above 3 stars, so I usually just chill with 2-3. I think that's realistic though given that it's generally pretty easy for a police force to fuck up one guy if they really need to.

I was also pretty happy with most of the humor of the game being in line with what I expected from the series. They still lambast the corporations and consumerism. I'm really concerned they will lose sight of this aspect soon but I think 5 hit the mark still. 

For what it's worth, I didn't actually *hate* online either. The big bank heist was decent but the load times, hackers, and mission grinding kinda wrecked it for me. I would much rather have had them put all that online effort into SP but overall I think 5 will be the last great one. 6 should be great given how long it's taking but I suspect they will go even harder into the online, pay to play aspects.
                Sure getting in a buggy and doing some off roading is fun I won’t deny that, but it’s not enough I don’t think. The map feels largely unused outside of the city. The physics of vehicles are different but I meant the physics that happen when you crash, in IV you fly out the windscreen and the car buckles under the impact. If you crash a bike you go over the handlebars at the speed you crashed and literally soar through the air. You really feel the crashes in IV, in V they are nerfed to the point that car deformation is severely cut back and the crashes themselves lack impact. 

Niko would definitely hang out with Brucie, if you listen to their dialogues it becomes clear just why their friendship works despite them being polar opposites. The gang and drug wars are probably the best side missions in the entire GTA IV saga, they are simply pure GTA. Rolling up on a crew in a blacked out SUV, shooting the place up and fucking off with their coke slung over your back while the cops chase you… it doesn’t get more GTA than that. 

I meant switch characters in V when you are hanging out with the other two. You can get all three of them to hang out, but you can’t switch you are stuck with the one who initiates the hang out. The switch is ok in free roam  if you find yourself in a spot that you can’t be bothered getting out of like in the middle of the ocean or something, but as a mechanic that actually elevates the options you have in the game, doing game stuff, like getting into chases and cop fights and whatnot, it is lacking. 

I dunno what to say about the cops if you like them spawning all over then I guess that works for you, for me though it ruins the immersion to have cops spawn randomly. In GTA 4 you can actually hear on the police radio where they are being dispatched from and the cops actually spawn coming from the direction of that neighbourhood. You can strategically avoid them this way if you want, or just go right at them. It’s true that it is not realistic for one man to fight off an entire force but it’s still a game and it’s all about balance, and in V the cops have godly levels of accuracy. They still hit me even when I’m speeding down the street at 100mph in a sports car and swerving through traffic. Not even joking. 

As for online, I think it started out quite good, but it became awful as they added more and more crap to it that just made it a convoluted mess. And don’t even get me started on all the stupid futuristic bullshit they added. No wonder Dan Houser and Leslie Benzies have both left Rockstar.
                    >The physics of vehicles are different but I meant the physics thathappen when you crash, in IV you fly out the windscreen and the carbuckles under the impact.

Damn i definitely need to check it out again.  Definitely never saw those drug and gang missions but im all about it. I remember loving the gang wars of San Andreas lol.

I hear you about the cops too, now I'm excited to go back and try that. As much fun as it is fucking with them in the wilderness, it's equally as fun to lose them in a legit chase in the city, which is probably better if they don't spawn everywhere. I'm probably going to be a menace in Liberty city since I'm used to the perfect aiming robot cops of V.

I agree online is a mess now. I quit playing around when those flying bikes and CEO missions started. It's all about the money and selling shark cards for rockstar, which is sad.

Benzies and Houser leaving is probably the beginning of the end, unfortunately. Will always love the series though. Right from GTA 1 and London I was hooked.

Anyway, you've convinced me I need to get a gta IV complete edition. Can probably find a disc copy for like $20
Yes it is also runing "fine" on my laptop  on lower settings, but i still cant max it out on my pc and that just shouldn't be a thing with a 13 years old game
    Tried DXVK? Worked wonders for me.
    Unmodded it's really not *graphically* intensive at all by today's standards, TBH. Just rather CPU-bound.
I was talking about what would happen if they released a remaster of IV with those kind of character models too, using the same stupid excuse of making things cartoony.

But to awnser your point: It's not exactly a fair comparison since none of these games have even half the amount of content that San Andreas alone had.

Resident Evil 4 character models are far more detailed and and realistic than SA had too, but RE4 and none of the other games you mentioned had over 200 driveable vehicles, none of them had over 100 licensed songs that played on the radio, they didn't had a customizable main character, they didn't had over 30 different kinds of minigames and side missions, and more importantly they didn't had a fully open, explorable and fleshed out open world that looked alive.
It's because of limitations of the engine and the scope of the game.  Theres a reason games like GTA look inferior to Call of Duty and Half-Life 2.

Call of Duty has small contained maps for each mission that have to load individually and the same goes for HL2.  GTA SA had a large map that had to have the whole world available all at once and tried at it best to make it look good as well.  It's the same reason why MMOs don't look as good as other games as well.
They need to make a **new** game, not running off of nostalgia for these series
    Now they've lost Benzies and Houser, I actually think that all I'm now hoping for from them in the rest of their lifetime as a company is some really solid modern remakes of GTAIII-SA, Episodes x2, and the complete GTAIV.

I'd rather have premium fully made slices of the past than a GTAVI targeted at the Shark Card market and made without the involvement of the people who helped make the previous games so enduring.
        Agree 100%

It’s like new Beatles music without any of the Beatles.
It runs a little worse than a game from 2008 should, yeah, but otherwise is definitely a better experience than the original PS3 version was, as it can do 60+ FPS at your resolution of choice.
I'd say they should improve the performance and upgrade some textures and lighting, that's all. they shouldn't touch the models or the physics or anything.
    [deleted]
        console brothers cant mod it sadly
The pc graphics with 60 FPS on next gen is acceptable
I wrote an Armenian version of his name, cuz that Niko looks like 111% stereotypo Armenian
LOL
because the ps3 was notoriously hard to port games to or from, ~~it had something weird to do with it's memory and ram and graphics in the way they all connected and streamed data to each other~~. and so most companies never bothered with it once they had a game functioning properly on the ps3, that's why a ton of PS2 classics weren't really Backwards compatible, and why nearly NO ps3 games are compatible with the PS4.

the ps3 was essentially a Frankenstein's monster of hardware that the crack heads at Sony somehow managed to get to work together, but because of their wizardry it made it incredibly difficult to do anything with.

EDIT: the PS3 was difficult to develop for because of the way it's CPU, GPU, and memory worked together, whereas in theory it was relative powerhouse (some estimates put it's processing power above that of the Xbox 360), but because the CPU was one main CPU and then 7 smaller "floating" CPUs it made deving for it a pain. because instead of the "floating CPUs being able to pull directly from the ram, they had to go through the main CPU in order to access the ram, but if a game was programmed correctly and took advantage of that (as quite a few larger titles did) then it would run better than the 360. but a lot of smaller devs, or even a lot of larger but lazy devs I.E. bethesda, just didn't bother trying to optimize their code and therefor a lot of other games ran like crap on the ps3.
They also have a new one i checked its called gangstar New York honestly doesn't look that bad either i think they would have done a much better job remastering the trilogy than the other company
Ok
    I would pay all the money I have for a game like that
They could have made full on remakes for each of those games and sell them as standalones. And if it was made using the GTA5 engine they could use the new assets they made for GTA online as well.
People are _right now_ losing interest in their series.  My friends and I are peeved enough to turn our noses up at GTA 6 should it ever materialize.

Which it won’t.  Rockstar’s (glory and reputation) days are over.  Dan Hauser and Leslie Benzies left their companies in the hands of greedy lawyers.
It's not Rockstar's Fault. Nor is is it the Developers themselves faults. The fault for the trilogy lies with Take Two's Executives. Take Two Executives have decided that Short Term profits far exceed Long time Profit, whose end will lead to extremely cheaply made games, that will ultimately cause Take Two's Executive Board to virtually Annihilate Rockstar as a Gaming Development Company. Take Two bought out Rockstar, and Rockstar went into Studio Decline after Dan Houser left. There is no original Gaming studio of the PS2 era left with Rockstar or most other companies. Those companies, have new executives, with more greed then sense, and more young developers who want only a paycheck and comfortable job and care little for their Content. This has been happening not just in the Gaming Industry of the U.S, but since 1991, with the end of the cold war, All Industries in the US and Worldwide have went from Product Oriented (has QC, etc.) To Service Oriented (lack of QC, etc.). Don't blame the creative talent for their lack of work. They were explicitly told by the Exec's to not deliver the Remaster we wanted. They couldn't go over their hourly or salary wage. Else they'd lose their job. This is how this industry works. I utterly hate it, when people hate on the wrong man, just trying to make his way in life.
still looks incredible on higher resolutions. playing it right now on the dog shit PC port but it runs stable enough to enjoy it
    Does it run any better after they removed the "games for windows" or whatever it was?  
I recall it being a bit choppy before.
        Yes and No I guess. I remember before they got rid of that I always had trouble just logging in to the fucking game in the first place so if that's what your issue was then yeah that's gone but they just replaced it with the social club launcher the asshats, but my PC is from 2014 and it runs it at like 50 FPS mostly consistently when in the city and fluid indoors so as long as you don't have an ooga booga caveman pc it should run adequately.

There's supposedly this method of adding this Linux file to your .exe folder thats supposed to double your framerate but I followed the install guide to the letter and it took my FPS down to 5 or 7 when outdoors but fluid 60 indoors

PC games during that whole games for windows live era really got fucked I hope whoever came up with that shit is sleeping with the fishes
            There is a Vulkan wrapper available that fixes performance on GTAIV if you have a decent machine. I went from a stuttery 10-20 fps mess to 60+ fps buttery smoothness after installing it this past weekend.
                That's the one I was referring to.  The two .dll files you put into your exe folder?I used the guide on the front page of the store on steam. it just made me performance tank
            I had an i5 (6th gen) and 1050ti at the time, I think. GTA5 ran ok with those cpu/gpu, but GTA4 didn't seem to.
                like I said it's a dog shit port regardless of the external issues.
Physics doesn't make a game, fun gameplay does which gta 4 lacked imo but whatever.
    Why is it you keep chasing after people who loves IV in this thread?
Well rdr can't be pirated on pc
    Sure it can, via PS3 emulator

        woah thank you
            your welcome mate!
    It  can be, but it still has terrible performance.
Especially VCS, easily the best 3d universe game overall
    VCS is like a rarity these days. You’d be forgiven for not even knowing it existed. Can’t even buy it on the store. I would like to play it again on the Vita (yes, I still have a Vita)
        VCS is so far, the only GTA game exculsive to Playstation, since It can only be played on the PSP and PS2. Imo, It deserves a re-release
Your comment is still incorrect because GTA CTW would not be considered a spin off.
    It is a spinoff
        No it's not. It takes place in the HD universe between GTA IV and GTA V. Sure it has elements that take place in the GTA IV triad storyline but you wouldn't have needed to have played GTA IV first to understand what is going on and the story stands on it's own two feet. In fact the connection is so small, it's more like an easter egg than an actual main plotline. It isn't like GTA LCS where a minor character is given their own game.

And even though it has connections to GTA IV and GTA V...going by that logic, all GTA games are spin-offs of each other and therefore your comment still wouldn't make sense.
            It’s still a spinoff of the HD games just like GTA Advance was a spinoff of the 3D games. It isn’t even acknowledged in V at all. 

And what makes Huang Lee any better than Tony? Huang was just a random name on the police database in GTA 4…talk about minor character. 

My comment makes perfect sense hence why it is upvoted as much as it is. Sorry buddy.
                Okay then. Let's just agree to disagree and call it even.
And that was only on the PC. On console it ran fine
Repetitive missions and no variety.... anyone who has played it even once would know but yeah sure.
    [deleted]
        Gta 5 was the exact opposite of being repetitive. Every mission was unique so I don't know how anyone could think otherwise. You may not like the game but the game is anything but repetitive.
            let me rephrase my answer.

in my opinion gta5 didn't really sit right with me, firstly the humour felt forced and they went for more over the top gameplay than in gta4. My second point is that the story didn't feel as coherent in 5 than it did in 4 and for that reason I couldn't really connect with the characters, whereas in gta4 you get somewhat attached to certain characters such as roman for example.

Finally due to the realism in gta4 you understand the meaning of the game.

Sure gta5 is more comprehensive in terms of a sandbox game but in terms of story gta4 outdoes it.
                This

I gave uo GTA V's story, Its honestly one of the weaker ones in the series
                    the cycle of trevor hating michael was extremely repetitive and i remember getting really sick and tired of it by the end
                        I completed only past the first heist and i felt burned out alr.

Its that bad imo
Only a clown would take youtube comments seriously. Moreover the vocal majority doesn't count. More people love and play gta 5 and that's what matters. Gta 4 toxic players verbally abuse other players and spew venom in the youtube comments sections. I'm sure you are one of those people who'd trash gta 6 when it comes out and suddenly start praising gta 5.
    Hey  clown look at your downvotes and sit down boy, your   opinion is wrong and that's a fact. Now be quiet, the grown ups are talking.
    now go home and take your sharkcards
        It's as if you didn't even read what I wrote. Well...can't expect much from folks like you. Can't even take folks like you seriously.
            nostalgic?...bruh i play gta v first before i went to gta iv
    Lol…I guess you cried 😂. The only people playing GTA V are the brainless losers buying Shark cards lmao.
    Meh, only a clown would also take your Reddit comments seriously too 🤷‍♂️
I agree the story was lackluster. I still think the missions had some great moments. Also, what about the other SP stuff: the free roam, the map, the stunt jumps, mowing down cows in slow-mo cinematic view ? Mt. chilliad with 4 stars ? military base ? big shitty dump trucks, parking a bunch of busses in front of the LRT, off roading in raton canyon ? 

None of that does anything for you ?
    All that stuff is fine, 5 is far from a bad game it’s just a weak GTA game. It’s the most boring map of the series for me, and the country is just pure wasted space. How many times can you do an off road race? Or attack the military base? It doesn’t keep you engaged especially when the gameplay just feels lacking, the shooting mechanics are boring and lack oomph, guns sound really weak, being able to carry all weapons removes any balance, the driving requires no real skill or thought so chases are less compelling, the physics are downgraded so crashes are just boring. It’s missing a lot of side missions that are crime based too. 

In GTA 4 you have Jacob’s drug deliveries, Brucie’s car thefts, Stevie’s car thefts, the most wanted, and later the Assassinations, all of these can result in unscripted emergent gameplay moments because they are built into the world organically, so gangs and cops can interfere. They also all feel like things Niko would actually do. Add the two DLC’s and you have the amazing Gang and Drug Wars, yet more vehicle thefts, and those epic vehicle Triathlons with nitro. They feel more connected to the world. 

5’s side activities just feel dropped in there for the sake of having content. Lester has less assassinations, and they’re all scripted to hell, no gang wars of any kind. It barely even feels like there are gangs in the game. Franklin needed some gang wars at least. Trevor could’ve had meth heads and rural gangs attacking his cook house etc. Instead he gets a pitiful four bounty missions. I liked them a lot, why just 4?? Should have been twice that at least. It’s like they legit ran out of dev time or couldn’t be bothered. Trevor does have drug drops at his airport, but they are also very scripted so the emergent gameplay potential is lost. Even hanging out in 5 with the other protagonists is crap, why can’t you switch characters? That was the big selling point of the game!! Imagine the trouble you could get up to if you could switch between them and strategically place them about. And this doesn’t even work in missions where they are together as they just go back to a predetermined spot and select their own weapon. It is just bad, eliminates any strategy and shows that the switch mechanic and mission design is poorly thought out. 

And the cops AI…it is the worst in the series by far, they literally spawn on the side of the mountain if you’re up there, and have inhuman aiming abilities so fights are just not that fun because you just get absolutely swarmed by cops spawning off screen.
        Thanks for the reply. I think your points about lack of trevor-rural gang missions, and complete absence of Franklin gang-activity are very solid and to your point, probably can be explained by the focus on online development. The off road races *were* garbage and way too easy. I never did them all. When I say offroading i'm just referring to souping up a pickup and doin my own thing. I never noticed vehicle physics being any worse than before and still enjoy destroying vehicles, are they downgraded from IV ? True that the military base isn't great, and when you finally do get away successfully with a tank, it blows up way too easy. They put a lot of work into that base though which is kind of a shame actually.

I'm not sure Niko would hang out with a guy like Brucie lol and I can't actually remember those other side missions. I will have to play IV again cause it's been a while. I played gay tony and L&D and those were great but I never checked out gang and drug wars so maybe I have some homework.

You *can* switch characters, just not while wanted. I never considered the idea you could use that strategically if it was executed better, but good point. I always just used it when I got sick of a character or got stranded. I was glad to have the option in those cases.

I enjoyed the 5 assassinations, especially the stock market manipulation aspect. It feels scripted for sure, but what's not to like about blowing the lifeintruder CEO's face apart with a cell phone bomb, from the comfort of micheals living room ? 

Cop AI *was* kinda shitty. Worst in the series? maybe. again, I have to play IV again. I know they are still fun to fuck around with. I thoroughly enjoy spawning cops on top of mountains, so I thought that makes up for the inconvenience of them spawning where they don't make sense to spawn.

For what it's worth, I didn't actually *hate* online either. The big bank heist was decent but the load times, hackers, and mission grinding kinda wrecked it for me. I would much rather have had them put all that online effort into SP but overall I think 5 will be the last great one. 6 should be great given how long it's taking but I suspect they will go even harder into the online, pay to play aspects.
            Sure getting in a buggy and doing some off roading is fun I won’t deny that, but it’s not enough I don’t think. The map feels largely unused outside of the city.

If you crash a bike you go over the handlebars at the speed you crashed and literally soar through the air.

VCS is like a rarity these days. You’d be forgiven for not even knowing it existed. Can’t even buy it on the store. I would like to play it again on the Vita (yes, I still have a Vita)
    VCS is so far, the only GTA game exculsive to Playstation, since It can only be played on the PSP and PS2. Imo, It deserves a re-release
It is a spinoff
    No it's not. It takes place in the HD universe between GTA IV and GTA V. Sure it has elements that take place in the GTA IV triad storyline but you wouldn't have needed to have played GTA IV first to understand what is going on and the story stands on it's own two feet. In fact the connection is so small, it's more like an easter egg than an actual main plotline. It isn't like GTA LCS where a minor character is given their own game.

And even though it has connections to GTA IV and GTA V...going by that logic, all GTA games are spin-offs of each other and therefore your comment still wouldn't make sense.
        It’s still a spinoff of the HD games just like GTA Advance was a spinoff of the 3D games. It isn’t even acknowledged in V at all. 

And what makes Huang Lee any better than Tony? Huang was just a random name on the police database in GTA 4…talk about minor character. 

My comment makes perfect sense hence why it is upvoted as much as it is. Sorry buddy.
            Okay then. Let's just agree to disagree and call it even.

    Gta 5 was the exact opposite of being repetitive. Every mission was unique so I don't know how anyone could think otherwise. You may not like the game but the game is anything but repetitive.
        let me rephrase my answer.

in my opinion gta5 didn't really sit right with me, firstly the humour felt forced and they went for more over the top gameplay than in gta4. My second point is that the story didn't feel as coherent in 5 than it did in 4 and for that reason I couldn't really connect with the characters, whereas in gta4 you get somewhat attached to certain characters such as roman for example.

Finally due to the realism in gta4 you understand the meaning of the game.

Sure gta5 is more comprehensive in terms of a sandbox game but in terms of story gta4 outdoes it.
            This

I gave uo GTA V's story, Its honestly one of the weaker ones in the series
                the cycle of trevor hating michael was extremely repetitive and i remember getting really sick and tired of it by the end
                    I completed only past the first heist and i felt burned out alr.

Its that bad imo
Hey  clown look at your downvotes and sit down boy, your   opinion is wrong and that's a fact. Now be quiet, the grown ups are talking.
now go home and take your sharkcards
    It's as if you didn't even read what I wrote. Well...can't expect much from folks like you. Can't even take folks like you seriously.
        nostalgic?...bruh i play gta v first before i went to gta iv
Lol…I guess you cried 😂. The only people playing GTA V are the brainless losers buying Shark cards lmao.
Meh, only a clown would also take your Reddit comments seriously too 🤷‍♂️
All that stuff is fine, 5 is far from a bad game it’s just a weak GTA game. It’s the most boring map of the series for me, and the country is just pure wasted space. How many times can you do an off road race? Or attack the military base? It doesn’t keep you engaged especially when the gameplay just feels lacking, the shooting mechanics are boring and lack oomph, guns sound really weak, being able to carry all weapons removes any balance, the driving requires no real skill or thought so chases are less compelling, the physics are downgraded so crashes are just boring. It’s missing a lot of side missions that are crime based too. 

In GTA 4 you have Jacob’s drug deliveries, Brucie’s car thefts, Stevie’s car thefts, the most wanted, and later the Assassinations, all of these can result in unscripted emergent gameplay moments because they are built into the world organically, so gangs and cops can interfere. They also all feel like things Niko would actually do. Add the two DLC’s and you have the amazing Gang and Drug Wars, yet more vehicle thefts, and those epic vehicle Triathlons with nitro. They feel more connected to the world. 

5’s side activities just feel dropped in there for the sake of having content. Lester has less assassinations, and they’re all scripted to hell, no gang wars of any kind. It barely even feels like there are gangs in the game. Franklin needed some gang wars at least. Trevor could’ve had meth heads and rural gangs attacking his cook house etc. Instead he gets a pitiful four bounty missions. I liked them a lot, why just 4?? Should have been twice that at least. It’s like they legit ran out of dev time or couldn’t be bothered. Trevor does have drug drops at his airport, but they are also very scripted so the emergent gameplay potential is lost. Even hanging out in 5 with the other protagonists is crap, why can’t you switch characters? That was the big selling point of the game!! Imagine the trouble you could get up to if you could switch between them and strategically place them about. And this doesn’t even work in missions where they are together as they just go back to a predetermined spot and select their own weapon. It is just bad, eliminates any strategy and shows that the switch mechanic and mission design is poorly thought out. 

And the cops AI…it is the worst in the series by far, they literally spawn on the side of the mountain if you’re up there, and have inhuman aiming abilities so fights are just not that fun because you just get absolutely swarmed by cops spawning off screen.
    Thanks for the reply. I think your points about lack of trevor-rural gang missions, and complete absence of Franklin gang-activity are very solid and to your point, probably can be explained by the focus on online development. The off road races *were* garbage and way too easy. I never did them all. When I say offroading i'm just referring to souping up a pickup and doin my own thing. I never noticed vehicle physics being any worse than before and still enjoy destroying vehicles, are they downgraded from IV ? True that the military base isn't great, and when you finally do get away successfully with a tank, it blows up way too easy. They put a lot of work into that base though which is kind of a shame actually.

I'm not sure Niko would hang out with a guy like Brucie lol and I can't actually remember those other side missions. I will have to play IV again cause it's been a while. I played gay tony and L&D and those were great but I never checked out gang and drug wars so maybe I have some homework.

You *can* switch characters, just not while wanted. I never considered the idea you could use that strategically if it was executed better, but good point. I always just used it when I got sick of a character or got stranded. I was glad to have the option in those cases.

I enjoyed the 5 assassinations, especially the stock market manipulation aspect. It feels scripted for sure, but what's not to like about blowing the lifeintruder CEO's face apart with a cell phone bomb, from the comfort of micheals living room ? 

Cop AI *was* kinda shitty. Worst in the series? maybe. again, I have to play IV again. I know they are still fun to fuck around with. I thoroughly enjoy spawning cops on top of mountains, so I thought that makes up for the inconvenience of them spawning where they don't make sense to spawn. They are super difficult in GTA 5 above 3 stars, so I usually just chill with 2-3. I think that's realistic though given that it's generally pretty easy for a police force to fuck up one guy if they really need to.

I was also pretty happy with most of the humor of the game being in line with what I expected from the series. They still lambast the corporations and consumerism. I'm really concerned they will lose sight of this aspect soon but I think 5 hit the mark still. 

For what it's worth, I didn't actually *hate* online either. The big bank heist was decent but the load times, hackers, and mission grinding kinda wrecked it for me. I would much rather have had them put all that online effort into SP but overall I think 5 will be the last great one. 6 should be great given how long it's taking but I suspect they will go even harder into the online, pay to play aspects.
        Sure getting in a buggy and doing some off roading is fun I won’t deny that, but it’s not enough I don’t think. The map feels largely unused outside of the city. The physics of vehicles are different but I meant the physics that happen when you crash, in IV you fly out the windscreen and the car buckles under the impact. If you crash a bike you go over the handlebars at the speed you crashed and literally soar through the air. You really feel the crashes in IV, in V they are nerfed to the point that car deformation is severely cut back and the crashes themselves lack impact. 

Niko would definitely hang out with Brucie, if you listen to their dialogues it becomes clear just why their friendship works despite them being polar opposites. The gang and drug wars are probably the best side missions in the entire GTA IV saga, they are simply pure GTA. Rolling up on a crew in a blacked out SUV, shooting the place up and fucking off with their coke slung over your back while the cops chase you… it doesn’t get more GTA than that. 

I meant switch characters in V when you are hanging out with the other two. You can get all three of them to hang out, but you can’t switch you are stuck with the one who initiates the hang out. The switch is ok in free roam  if you find yourself in a spot that you can’t be bothered getting out of like in the middle of the ocean or something, but as a mechanic that actually elevates the options you have in the game, doing game stuff, like getting into chases and cop fights and whatnot, it is lacking. 

I dunno what to say about the cops if you like them spawning all over then I guess that works for you, for me though it ruins the immersion to have cops spawn randomly. In GTA 4 you can actually hear on the police radio where they are being dispatched from and the cops actually spawn coming from the direction of that neighbourhood. You can strategically avoid them this way if you want, or just go right at them. It’s true that it is not realistic for one man to fight off an entire force but it’s still a game and it’s all about balance, and in V the cops have godly levels of accuracy. They still hit me even when I’m speeding down the street at 100mph in a sports car and swerving through traffic. Not even joking. 

As for online, I think it started out quite good, but it became awful as they added more and more crap to it that just made it a convoluted mess. And don’t even get me started on all the stupid futuristic bullshit they added. No wonder Dan Houser and Leslie Benzies have both left Rockstar.
            >The physics of vehicles are different but I meant the physics thathappen when you crash, in IV you fly out the windscreen and the carbuckles under the impact.

Damn i definitely need to check it out again.  Definitely never saw those drug and gang missions but im all about it. I remember loving the gang wars of San Andreas lol.

I hear you about the cops too, now I'm excited to go back and try that. As much fun as it is fucking with them in the wilderness, it's equally as fun to lose them in a legit chase in the city, which is probably better if they don't spawn everywhere. I'm probably going to be a menace in Liberty city since I'm used to the perfect aiming robot cops of V.

I agree online is a mess now. I quit playing around when those flying bikes and CEO missions started. It's all about the money and selling shark cards for rockstar, which is sad.

Benzies and Houser leaving is probably the beginning of the end, unfortunately. Will always love the series though. Right from GTA 1 and London I was hooked.

Anyway, you've convinced me I need to get a gta IV complete edition. Can probably find a disc copy for like $20
Agree 100%

It’s like new Beatles music without any of the Beatles.
console brothers cant mod it sadly
Yes and No I guess. I remember before they got rid of that I always had trouble just logging in to the fucking game in the first place so if that's what your issue was then yeah that's gone but they just replaced it with the social club launcher the asshats, but my PC is from 2014 and it runs it at like 50 FPS mostly consistently when in the city and fluid indoors so as long as you don't have an ooga booga caveman pc it should run adequately.

There's supposedly this method of adding this Linux file to your .exe folder thats supposed to double your framerate but I followed the install guide to the letter and it took my FPS down to 5 or 7 when outdoors but fluid 60 indoors

PC games during that whole games for windows live era really got fucked I hope whoever came up with that shit is sleeping with the fishes
    There is a Vulkan wrapper available that fixes performance on GTAIV if you have a decent machine. I went from a stuttery 10-20 fps mess to 60+ fps buttery smoothness after installing it this past weekend.
        That's the one I was referring to.  The two .dll files you put into your exe folder?I used the guide on the front page of the store on steam. it just made me performance tank
    I had an i5 (6th gen) and 1050ti at the time, I think. GTA5 ran ok with those cpu/gpu, but GTA4 didn't seem to.
        like I said it's a dog shit port regardless of the external issues.
woah thank you
