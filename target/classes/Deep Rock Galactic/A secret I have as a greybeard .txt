[[A secret I have as a greybeard ]]


I don't like drinking blackout. Really it's just cause I feel like it wastes time with having you wait to respawn in the medbay.

Usually I just jump through the barrel hoop or dare I say drink leaf lovers 

Just don't really like it y'know? It's just time consuming to me

(Comedical sigh)... It feels better to get that off my chest


I also do this and I too am a grey beard.
But I mainly do it out of habit in replacing the oily oaf the green beards bought with something like red rock blaster or tunnel rat or something.
    Fair enough 

I am usually the one to buy the buff beer and stuff 

As well as most of the event beers. The Wurst beer seems tasty ngl, gotta get it every mission while it's available lol
i once did an entire deep dive under the effects of blackout. timed it so we launched the mission right before I passed out. 

only died twice, and it was just to see if I could get rid of the effect.
    By Karl himself you are literally 4 parallel universes ahead of me in skill
        Heâ€™s playing 4D chess while frozen drifting through space toward Hoxxes
            So eventually, he stopped thinking.
                You all were thinking in the first place? I don't see the point
                    Drink, Mine, Kill, Repeat
    It makes me feel ill, and always has :/
        Same lol. Playing a mission while virtually drunk gives me eye strain. Not a fun time so I always jump in the hoop to clear the effect
            Nausea here, although the lower level is more tolerable and wears off
    I tried to do that once and I almost threw up lmao
    Ive done that a couple times though i feel being a Lok-1 and pgl engie main my build probably has it easier than most others

    by karl your pickaxe is huge we get it no need to flaunt it
hmmm drinking leaf lovers for efficiency, so you can get more bug killing in. such a moral grey area
I just go drunk. Haz 3 with greenbeards and drunkenness are my favorite modifier/mission combo.
Death is a preferable alternative to sobriety.
Real greybeards enjoy a good ol fashion oily oaf.

 Blackout stouts are more for green beards trying to prove something.
Got onto the mission blackout drunk a few times before. Can't say I regret those times
Grab the beer, don't drink it, go change class. No more beer.
Here's a secret I got from Karl himself : if you rev one of your downed teamates right before dizziness starts, you avoid it entirely. Gotta practice the timing but can be quite reliable.

Obviously perfect to show off you grey beardness !
barrel hoop - Free drunk removal  
leaf lover - very cheap drunk removal (ew who would buy this)  
blackout stout - the relatively expensive fun drunk removal (takes too long tho)
My driller drinks Blacklock lager and communes with the dead in the memorial hall
    ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Honestly? Yeah. I drank a ton of leaf lovers cuz I was at only ~100 credits and by the end, I had exactly 0, for the funny of course
As a greybeard myself leaf lovers is my favorite drink because drinking it or saying I like it gets me kicked out of lobbies and I think that's hilarious.
Jump through the hoop? That is fine. Donâ€™t drink anything if you donâ€™t want to! Butâ€¦ youâ€¦ you drink LEAF LOVERS? Iâ€™m ashamed to call you a gray beard, they should be able to revoke that!
    Hey man I just want to save time 

A greybeard must cut some cords here and there eventually 

Even if they break your own heart
        Itâ€™s faster to drink nothinâ€™ thank drink a leaf lovers. For shame.
            Well here lemme ask you this 

Jokes aside it's just a digital drink, not really hurting anyone y'know?
                Management would be proud of you, you filthy grass rat
                Why are we putting the jokes aside? Thatâ€™s not very Karl of you.
When you start as a greenbeard you mine all the gold and haul around all that you can, drink normal drinks, possibly leaf lover by mistake. 

When you're a graybeard (ironically) you're exprienced and won't mine what you don't need and put what's more important ahead of everything, like reviving teammates no matter how far they are or doing objectives first 


In the gap between the two phases of life, you tend to do stupid shit. 

Im in that phase. I temp-shock my insides by drinking BurningLove and ArkenStout, drink 3 BlackoutStouts, jump into the hoop daily (**im in heavy debt to the company for the rebuilding cost of my internal and external bodily properties, most of my organs have been replaced with artificial ones as further recreation was deemed impossible and too costly due to the repetitive repairs causing the organs to lose shape and characteristics**) and even tried drinking leaf lover after Wormhole so I wouldn't come back. 

I reload cancel which is starting to take a heavy toll on my fingers, i have pointed an Overclocked weapon at my face, **DARE** to fu*k with a driller as the Scout that I am, and sniffed red sugar mixed with Apoca Bloom pollen and mactera extract.

I have been to the military court three times and rehab twice.

I hope i leave soon enough. Praise be with Karl and all that he left for us.
If you time it right, it can give you a very epic new challenge. Launch into mission and drink blackout stout right before you deploy on a deep dive. It will test you abilities as a dwarf.
When Management starts to feel like family, you know it's time to quit drinking Leaf Lovers!
I like to get the buff beer, and then a mactera brew to fart on another Dwarf before I drop to Hoxxes with slightly drunk screen effects.
I guess I'm also a grey beard but I don't drink non buff alcohols cause the Drunk effect makes me motion sick in the real world lmao
theres no such thing as wasting time, when slacking off in the abyss bar is slacking off no matter what! Now down that beer, for Karl!
Ive drank so much beer blackout doesnt even knock me down anymore
Actually uhhhh you can just hit escape and press respawn at the bottom left
the thing to to time ir right so you fall before you friend and he revives you so you can revive him right the moment he fall
Not actually a greybeard, then.
I jump through the hoop as well but I will never drink leaf loversðŸ˜­
I usually also jump in the hoop, but if someone orders blackout stout, I wonâ€™t NOT drink it, yâ€™know? 
But drinking LEAF LOVERS? I can understand not drinking Blackout, but drinking the very drink that killed Karl?
I drink 2 blackout stout, makes it look more impressive
Im a level 2536 greybeard, and I sentence you to clean 6925 goo sacks.
0_o
When someone pours a round, I grab mine, drink it, and jump through the flaming death hoop before it takes effect.
