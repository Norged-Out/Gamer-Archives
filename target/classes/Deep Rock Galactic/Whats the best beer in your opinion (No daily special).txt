[[Whats the best beer in your opinion (No daily special)]]





Blackout stout please
    Blackout stout and Flintlocke's Delight are my fav
        I don't get Flintlocke that much because cost but I have a lot of starch nuts so blackout stout for dayss
            Yea starch nuts are the most prevalent out of the 3
                Lucky, it took me forever to unlock the daily because I found dozens of the other materials, but was stuck on 5 starch nuts for weeks
                    You probably just didn't look thorough enough
            I have over 200 starch nuts, but like 4 yeast cones. I just can't find them to save my life
                Yeah I got around 150 starch nuts but I've been holding off on the yeast cones so I got around 50
    Friend of mine got a blackout stout into a mission once. The poor fucker could barely see anything the whole time AND it was a low grav mission to boot. ‚ÄúI have no idea what‚Äôs ground!‚Äù
        Real dwarf experience right there.
            I've got to try that now.  Imagine a whole team like that.
                I hope they add ability for every dwarf to go blackout stout before the mission.
If I remember correctly only host can get blackout stout drunk (no reduce of drunkness over time, once tried on elite deep dive, we did it but at what cost?)
        We did something similliar on purpose. We  did a haz 5 elemination mission, 4 engy with fatboy and all drunk beer so that screen was shaking like crazy. To my surprise we did it and it was one of the most fun things even we all had like  10000 deads lol
        I've drank a blackout right before an industrial sabotage and suffered being incredibly drunk the entire time, it was incredibly awful lol, I felt so useless especially since I was playing scout. there should be a hidden achievement for completing a mission drunk
    That'll be a ROCK AND STONE from me
    Blackout stout and oily oaf are my favourite, third is wormhole special
    The proper way to remove a drunken state
    Yes
    The real man‚Äôs leaflover
Wormhole, let‚Äôs me go on space walks.
    plus flintlocker and your space walk is a rocket tour now ;)
        But of course, that goes without saying.
    Just gotta take the Underhill, do some minor clipping, and go exploring! Bonus if you have a friend around to toggle the gravity.
        malt rockbearer also works for this and doesnt require drinking early
            And you can permanently set it to low gravity if you hit it twice just right.
    There's a bug that lets you teleport twice with it and when you unteleplrt you teleport back to the first spot you teleported too. Take the beer and walk to any station that lets you change dwarves, drink the beer, go into the station, switch classes, wait a second, switch back, exit station. You'll have "teleported" while in the station then when leaving the station the game thinks you still need to teleport so it'll teleport you again. Once you unteleplrt you'll teleport to the place you would have teleported the first time. Infinite space walls minus the zero g and freezing.
The best wurst beer
    The wurst take
        I just enjoy the stirring animation
            There's just something off about it, the rigidity of the sausage and the sounds it makes just makes it feel like you're eating plastic stage food
                Have you ever had knackwurst?
                    I've not
                        D:
                        You have no idea what you're missing out on. Knackwurst is amazing.
                I like that it makes a very proper *tink tink* when they tap it against the mug.
Blackreach Blonde is a Pint of Party sign me up every time
    Shocked this isn‚Äôt higher. Best beer easily.
        I'm also often shocked that the beer comes witb its own music and passive dancing.

Too many times I have ordered a blackreach blonde and someome sgarts the jukebox.

Like MATES! COME ON!
    I love partying it up inside the drop pod as it goes down. A disco descent if you will. Sets a good vibe for any mission.
    That's always what I celebrate with after a deep dive
    this is the true answer
    This is the correct answer. Good vibes to break the ice between dwarves!
Smart stout
    I like how the smart stout is basically just the devs making fun of their own game‚Äôs logic, like how the power drills can‚Äôt drill minerals and how the drop pod always lands a hundred meters away
        Also scout‚Äôs line hinting that karl might still be alive somewhere in hoxxes
            What if... we're all Karl?   


What if other dwarves make stories about us and call us Karl?
            Now I want a mission type about rescuing a dwarf. Gotta get to them before they run outta ammo!
                You do that when you join an existing game.
    Agreed. Love the bursts of intellect you hear from your selected dwarf
Gut Wrecker. Nothing more iconic then dwarven burps
    I feel like it should kill you at the end lol
Glyphid Slammers, I like Slammin‚Äô Time
    Slammers are a very nice one, also sound good too
    Idk why but this reminded me of "Bursting makes me feel good"
    Yarr.
I really like the Oily Oaf, it gives me root beer vibes
    Plus its described as tasty.
    Same
    The description is just delicious. Buttery and rich in flavor, mmm
    i can taste it, for real
Underhill Deluxe
    If an underhilled client picks up the ball it will grow in size with them once the beer effect wears off.
        But can you do it multiple times?
        Really?

    I use it to escape the space rig
Mactera brew

        Augh! üí®üëÉü™∞ü™∞ü™∞üî•
            It‚Äôs smelly in here!
    My man, round of mactera brew for me and my team
Flintlockes of course
    I love ordering a round of flintlocks for greenbeards who don‚Äôt know what it does. Always gets the best reactions
    Flintlock + wormhole = one hell of a space walk
        I've seen this a couple times, you can drink two beers?!?!?
            Basically, ya gotta time it perfectly. Have everyone grab a flintlocks but don‚Äôt drink it, order a round of wormholes, chug the flintlocks and then grab the wormholes like your life depends on it. Assuming all goes to plan you shall being exploring the stars in no time.
                Thank you for this, I now have a new goal in life.
                    Good luck, miner! Just be wary that Wormhole doesn‚Äôt always make you go where you want to go so it may take a couple tries.
    I order flintlocks then tell people not to drink. I climb up to recalibrate the gravity and shout DRINK by the time they finish sipping the grav will be off and youll be soaring around the space rig. Knew a guy who would order a round of flints then a round of wormholes. If your lucky youll be outside and the flint will launch you to places you shouldnt see
Flintlock + wormhole immediately after. You're the rocket man!
burning love
    Classic spice
Seasoned moonrider.
    Makes anyone feel like a scout defying gravity
Oily Oaf or Glyphid Sammer. Oafs is nice cuz it‚Äôs adorable and slammer is good because I can get well hammered fast.
Blacklock Jageeeeer!
Of course, the majority of Dwarves would agree on, that Leaf Lovers Special is the ***worst*** beer on offer at the bar. Employees have repeatedly complained about it and are still asking to this day, why it is even an option to order. 

It hasn't been directly confirmed by management, but its inclusion basically dates back to a compromise with Elven trade agreements, which left a sour taste in a lot of Dwarven mouths. Not literally, though.

The taste of the Leaf Lovers is actually not the worst thing about it. It's natural ingredients make it a high quality beer with a mellow aroma and gentle tangy flavour, like the tender carress of an Elven maiden across your cheek. It hints towards sweetness and lemon make it similar to a Radler. There are a few things as refreshing as an icecold Leaf Lovers Special after a Magma Core mission. It is by no means objectively bad.

However, the biggest problem of the beverage is its lack of alcohol. Even the Special variant, that has been altered for export purposes, only has 3.8% alcohol, which is almost doubled from its very original recipe that the Elves came up with on their homeworld. Their biology reacts very sensitive to alcohol, making the Special variant shunned among their kind. 

The exact opposite is the case for the Dwarves, who are quite resistent to the effects of alcohol, making the Leaf Lovers Special a complete buzzkill for them. And practically useless for combat miners, who seek to apply a certain level of tipsiness before a mission, to numb themselves to the horrors of Hoxxes IV.
    I use beer to numb my legs before a mission, I know they're going to be under a lot of duress.
Its slammin time YAAAAAA
arkenstout i like sweet cold drink
Smart Stout and Blackreach Blond are tied for me. They both create really funny moments in lobby :D
Glyphid Slammers to get slammered with the boys in-between jobs
Wormhole + Flintlocke = space travel
Mactera brew because I have the sense of humor of a 5yo
    You are not alone, Round of mactera brew please
leaflover lover special because drinking at work is not professional, get back to work miners
    MANAGEMENT HAS BREACHED OUR RANKS!
Blackreach Blonde
*Slams down emptied mug*

Too bad for you, I don't listen to directions!
**LLOYD!** Another round of Red Rock Blasters, extra sugar 'round the rim!
Like the one that makes fart and burp                                                         Fart and burp funny                                                                                           Me laugh
Me like
    Same here, also Burp is Gutwrecker and Fart is Mactera brew
Leaf Lovers /srs
    some men just want to watch the world burn.
    Driller, get the C4. 
#
How much?
#
All of it.
leaf lover‚Äôs special, watered down of course.
Flintlocke
I like to mix flintlock's delight with wormhole special to get some real nice tours of the outside of the rig.
Underhill Deluxe
As a Kobold, I can confirm, Smart Stout.
Flintlocks, they're by far the best

Worst one is blackouts imo.
    Nono there is one worse, think about it for a sec
        Make fun of leaf lovers all you want, at least you can drink that without the worry of someone backing out of the toast and leaving you and two others unconsious on the floor with no way to get up for 10 fucking minutes.
            I trust my dwarven comrades with my life every day in the depths of hell, what‚Äôs 10 minutes of tomfoolery between brothers?
                In the depths they have a reason to care about you, on the rig they couldn't care since they don't need to trust you to keep bugs off their back. (Also it would've been longer but I left after I got back and found out we were all still down)
                    Was this a public or private lobby? If public, you might‚Äôve come face to face with a disguised leaf lover!
                        Public and it isn't the first time it's happened (I swear that equipment screen is crack for some dwarfs)
                            Ah well, no matter how strong the community is there will always be one or two bad eggs that sneak through. The stout might not be for you but let‚Äôs please not compare it to that leafy swill, lest the elves convert you.
                                Listen, drink what you like but the stout ain't for me. Flintlocks, slammers and moonshines are my choices (despite the protests from hoxxes in the form of it not giving me enough malt stars >:C )
                                    I‚Äôm perfectly alright with you not liking the stout, but we can both agree that leaf swill is the worst right? There‚Äôs ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt like this drink‚Äù and then there‚Äôs ‚Äúthis drink is an affront to society and dwarvenkind as we know it‚Äù. I personally find mactera brew pitifully boring.
I'm partial to Slayer Stout, but for the Fun beers? Blackreach Blonde for sure.
Can't go wrong with an Oily Oaf!
My friends and I always order a round of Blackreach Blondes to close out the night. Feels good to end the session with a rainbow dance party.
blackreach blonde for me
Arkenstout or Oily Oaf
Malt Rockbearer, because I love malt milkshakes, and Wormhole Special, because it's fun teleporting around.
blackreach blondes baby
Blackreach Blonde all day every day
Flintlocke's is my fav to get everyone after a mission.
The One That Kills you
    That would be leaf lover special if a dwarf sees you order one
Nothing (and I mean nothing) beats an Oily Oaf after a Deep Dive.  
Bonus if everyone joins in for a toast.
Blackout stout. Good for initiating greenbeards... and passing out is a good time to log off in a group
Underhill brew because, while I play a dwarf, I'm a hobbit at heart
You really can‚Äôt beat a classic oaf‚Ä¶
Oily oafs, but only when it‚Äôs shared with a buddy
Based on description and appeal, oily oaf sounds amazing, even planning on making a non alcoholic version irl.

Based on effect, underhill lets me glitch out of the space rig.
Oily oaf just seems like the most comfy beer to just sit and relax and enjoy, it's not there to get you blackout drunk or cause violent dancing. Just a calm relaxing drink.
Favorite Standard is Oily Oaf. Favorite special is Smart Stout.
Leaf lover
leaf lovers
BARTENDER I NEED A ROUND OF OILY OAFS, ICE COLD AND FOAMY!
Underhill Deluxe by far. It makes us even more dwarvish.
I like a combo, drink a flintlock them immediately drink a wormhole. if all goes correctly, you end up in space and shooting everywhere
I feel like oily oaf would have a really bad pour, like it would be more head than body, and as the name suggests it probably has a really oily mouth feel.

Blacklock lager seems like the go too choice, simple refined logo, historic legacy, and It sounds like it would keep the head at a good 5% compared to the others, only overflowing because Lloyd likes a generous pour.
Can I get a leaf lover's special extra tin with some water?
A round of oily oafs for me and my team!
Let's skip straight to the hangover.
Glyphid slammer
Me an elf disguised as a dwarf: ‚ÄúLeaflover of course!‚Äù
# Round of Red Rock Blasters, extra sugar around the rim please!
Red Rock Blaster
Managed to down five blackout stout before going under once. Never again
    You needed to go for six. If you drink an even number then it cancels out
Leaf Lover! Who's with me lads!
leaf lover's special
    *Your dislike madam, as requested*
        thank you
Glyphid Slammer! Red sugar on top please!
/cb Probably leaf lovers sinceI absolutely hate alcohol irl.
/ic Flintlocks Delight!
[removed]
    Why do you want downvotes so badly?
Smort Stout. I like the voice lines, because I can relate to them
    What I like the most about Smart Stout is that its potency is just under the first threshold for drunkenness, which makes me think that it's a subtle reference to the Ballmer Peak.
        Probable
Flintlock is the best when you turn off gravity
Wormhole is so cool
Glyphid Slammers
Flintlocks in zero g
Arkenstout!

I think that's the name
I'm a sucker for the Wormhole Special, learned that you can be teleported into the drop pod last time I drank one!
Blackout Stout
smart stout and the Underhill one
Smart stout, such a endless amount of unique and hilarious dialogue
Gut wrecker
Underhill deluxe, there‚Äôs something about clipping outside the spacerig and exploring that‚Äôs so fun to me
I always drop a Mactera Brew after the buff beer
Blackreach Blonde
Wormhole and underhill are my go to beers
Blackout
arkenstout mmmmmmcold
Blackreach blonde, always a good time
Black reach blonde is my favorite. I like drinks that taste good, make you feel good, i like the mug, and the refrence is to my favorite part of skyrim.
Seasoned Moonridet sounds good to me
Arkenstout while sitting in the glowing top of the drop pod. Cold cider in a sauna.
Black out stout and Wormhole special. Friends and I spent a while trying to warp to hoxes with it to get a screen shot
Sort of unrelated, but if you want a beer that tastes like Oily Oafs give O‚ÄôFallon‚Äôs Gooey Butter a try. It‚Äôs pretty sweet but almost exactly what I imagine it to taste like
I think they are all great but I've been liking the Arkenstout. Something about it is so "cool" to me
Glyphid Slammers, you had this shit with Red Sugar on top? Don‚Äôt even get me started on how it is with blue raspberry flavoring
Underhill deluxe
underhill deluxe
It‚Äôs cheap, it‚Äôs not leaflovers, and you can drink a lot of it before passing out so I think all in all it‚Äôs good
I quite enjoy a good Flintlocke and reset of the gravity control unit. Lots of fun rocketing around the rig for a bit.
Glyphid


Simple
Strong
Supports Lloyd
My personal favourites are Gliphid slammer and blacklock lager
Underhill deluxe because I like being a devious little gremlin in the lobby and confusing green beards
Glyphid Slammer or Blackout Stout
So you telling me that you really do enjoy it?

Me: Yes, Leaf Lover is good and I‚Äôm tired of pretend it isn‚Äôt
smart stout because i like the dialogue
Mix a 1/1 ratio of blackout stout and leaf lovers, let them mix in your gut to see which is stronger
Underhill deluxe or wormhole special
Worm Hole Special!
Glyphid slammers
I personally love me some of that blackreach blonde
Blackout stout and glyphid slammer
Ive played close to 200 hrs and never used beer. lol. Should I?
The one with bubbles. R&S
Arkenstout.
Blacklock Lager and Arkenstout are my favorites.
Oily Oaf.
Wormhole + Flintlocke for SPD (self-propelled dwarf). I'll get to Hoxxes my damn self, thank you.
Smart and black out stouts. The voice lines are amazing and black out stout just for sobering reason. Rlly wish they make some more beers in the future
Either smart stout for the vl or blackout stout because rock and stone
    That's it lads! Rock and Stone!
My fav combo is Flintlock and wormhole special
Mactera brew. The smell, it lingers!
arkenstout, it's nice for the magma core and the logo looks nice
Tunnel rats is unmatched
Glyphid slammer and oily oaf
smart stout
Gut Wrecker, I like the mug, the name and the funny effect.
Smart stout in my opinion bc there are some funny lines .
Hard choice between Blackreach Blonde and Arkenstout
Smart stout with wormhole being close second
Leaf Lovers ***TURBO***.
im a fan of Blacklock Lager
Rocky mountain. Some are more fun to drink, but this one is useful for mining.
The macterra brew
flintlocks and wormholes
RN I really would need smart stout I am writing my second term exam in 20 min and am not prepared well xd
I love flintlock delight. For one, the handle looks like a shotgun and secondly the effect is very funny, especially, when combined with moon rider or wormhole special.
POTS O GOLD
Blackout Stout! Any other answer is just wrong!
Blackreach Blonde, no contest.
I use wormhole as way to leave team
I really find smartspout cool, I find the voicelines pretty interesting
Oily oafs and arkenstout, i like cold drinks
I've always stuck with flintlocks, from day 1
Flintlock with no gravity
I love the effects from the wormhole special but the description from oily oaf just sounds so tasty
Nothing like a blackout after a successful run/failed run/last run/first run/any run/days ending in Y
The growing and shrinking ones so you can get out of the spacerig
Blackreach blonde, bring to drop pod, dance yo pants off on your way down.
Im partial to Underhill deluxe
Arkenstout. I use it to freeze myself in the middle of a dance pose.
Underhill. I like S M O L
Very big fan of the Arkenstout myself. Reminds one young dwarf of his time in the mountains.. Your first pickaxe... Ahh
Blackreach blond is my favourite, but i can't begin to explain how much i hate macrera brew.
Blacklock Lager. Shit hits hard enough to almost kill a dwarf. And I can almost hear my fallen brothers while under the effects.
Supporters edition Glyphid slammers.
I just like the way the cup looks.
This one was my nickname in college
Wormhole Special without a doubt. Even just the mug itself is pretty cool, teleportation aside.
Flintlock‚Äôs Delight
Glyphid Slammer, because I am a dwarf who needs to repress the memories of setting lootbugs on fire
Glyphid slammer, red sugar on top
Blackreach Blonde of course
I have Blackreach Blonde modded to look like error cube beer, that I like
Smart stout
Flintlock and wormhole area combo to be reckoned with
I know this is like a tread for people to share their niche fav beers but like. i love blue moon night sky and it never disappoint me. it literally always hits
Blackout stout and Flintlocke's Delight are my fav
    I don't get Flintlocke that much because cost but I have a lot of starch nuts so blackout stout for dayss
        Yea starch nuts are the most prevalent out of the 3
            Lucky, it took me forever to unlock the daily because I found dozens of the other materials, but was stuck on 5 starch nuts for weeks
                You probably just didn't look thorough enough
        I have over 200 starch nuts, but like 4 yeast cones. I just can't find them to save my life
            Yeah I got around 150 starch nuts but I've been holding off on the yeast cones so I got around 50

If I remember correctly only host can get blackout stout drunk (no reduce of drunkness over time, once tried on elite deep dive, we did it but at what cost?)
    We did something similliar on purpose. We  did a haz 5 elemination mission, 4 engy with fatboy and all drunk beer so that screen was shaking like crazy. To my surprise we did it and it was one of the most fun things even we all had like  10000 deads lol
    I've drank a blackout right before an industrial sabotage and suffered being incredibly drunk the entire time, it was incredibly awful lol, I felt so useless especially since I was playing scout. there should be a hidden achievement for completing a mission drunk
That'll be a ROCK AND STONE from me
Blackout stout and oily oaf are my favourite, third is wormhole special
The proper way to remove a drunken state
Yes

Makes anyone feel like a scout defying gravity
I use beer to numb my legs before a mission, I know they're going to be under a lot of duress.
You are not alone, Round of mactera brew please
MANAGEMENT HAS BREACHED OUR RANKS!
Same here, also Burp is Gutwrecker and Fart is Mactera brew
some men just want to watch the world burn.
Driller, get the C4.

How much?

All of it.
Nono there is one worse, think about it for a sec
    Make fun of leaf lovers all you want, at least you can drink that without the worry of someone backing out of the toast and leaving you and two others unconsious on the floor with no way to get up for 10 fucking minutes.
        I trust my dwarven comrades with my life every day in the depths of hell, what‚Äôs 10 minutes of tomfoolery between brothers?
            In the depths they have a reason to care about you, on the rig they couldn't care since they don't need to trust you to keep bugs off their back. (Also it would've been longer but I left after I got back and found out we were all still down)
                Was this a public or private lobby? If public, you might‚Äôve come face to face with a disguised leaf lover!
                    Public and it isn't the first time it's happened (I swear that equipment screen is crack for some dwarfs)
                        Ah well, no matter how strong the community is there will always be one or two bad eggs that sneak through. The stout might not be for you but let‚Äôs please not compare it to that leafy swill, lest the elves convert you.
                            Listen, drink what you like but the stout ain't for me. Flintlocks, slammers and moonshines are my choices (despite the protests from hoxxes in the form of it not giving me enough malt stars >:C )
                                I‚Äôm perfectly alright with you not liking the stout, but we can both agree that leaf swill is the worst right? There‚Äôs ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt like this drink‚Äù and then there‚Äôs ‚Äúthis drink is an affront to society and dwarvenkind as we know it‚Äù. I personally find mactera brew pitifully boring.
That would be leaf lover special if a dwarf sees you order one
You needed to go for six. If you drink an even number then it cancels out
*Your dislike madam, as requested*
    thank you
Why do you want downvotes so badly?
What I like the most about Smart Stout is that its potency is just under the first threshold for drunkenness, which makes me think that it's a subtle reference to the Ballmer Peak.
    Probable
That's it lads! Rock and Stone!
I don't get Flintlocke that much because cost but I have a lot of starch nuts so blackout stout for dayss
    Yea starch nuts are the most prevalent out of the 3
        Lucky, it took me forever to unlock the daily because I found dozens of the other materials, but was stuck on 5 starch nuts for weeks
            You probably just didn't look thorough enough
    I have over 200 starch nuts, but like 4 yeast cones. I just can't find them to save my life
        Yeah I got around 150 starch nuts but I've been holding off on the yeast cones so I got around 50
Real dwarf experience right there.
    I've got to try that now.  Imagine a whole team like that.
        I hope they add ability for every dwarf to go blackout stout before the mission.
If I remember correctly only host can get blackout stout drunk (no reduce of drunkness over time, once tried on elite deep dive, we did it but at what cost?)
We did something similliar on purpose. We  did a haz 5 elemination mission, 4 engy with fatboy and all drunk beer so that screen was shaking like crazy. To my surprise we did it and it was one of the most fun things even we all had like  10000 deads lol
I've drank a blackout right before an industrial sabotage and suffered being incredibly drunk the entire time, it was incredibly awful lol, I felt so useless especially since I was playing scout. there should be a hidden achievement for completing a mission drunk
But of course, that goes without saying.
malt rockbearer also works for this and doesnt require drinking early
    And you can permanently set it to low gravity if you hit it twice just right.
I just enjoy the stirring animation
    There's just something off about it, the rigidity of the sausage and the sounds it makes just makes it feel like you're eating plastic stage food
        Have you ever had knackwurst?
            I've not
                D:
                You have no idea what you're missing out on. Knackwurst is amazing.
        I like that it makes a very proper *tink tink* when they tap it against the mug.
I'm also often shocked that the beer comes witb its own music and passive dancing.

Too many times I have ordered a blackreach blonde and someome sgarts the jukebox.

Like MATES! COME ON!
Also scout‚Äôs line hinting that karl might still be alive somewhere in hoxxes
    What if... we're all Karl?   


What if other dwarves make stories about us and call us Karl?
    Now I want a mission type about rescuing a dwarf. Gotta get to them before they run outta ammo!
        You do that when you join an existing game.
But can you do it multiple times?
Really?

Augh! üí®üëÉü™∞ü™∞ü™∞üî•
    It‚Äôs smelly in here!
I've seen this a couple times, you can drink two beers?!?!?
    Basically, ya gotta time it perfectly. Have everyone grab a flintlocks but don‚Äôt drink it, order a round of wormholes, chug the flintlocks and then grab the wormholes like your life depends on it. Assuming all goes to plan you shall being exploring the stars in no time.
        Thank you for this, I now have a new goal in life.
            Good luck, miner! Just be wary that Wormhole doesn‚Äôt always make you go where you want to go so it may take a couple tries.
