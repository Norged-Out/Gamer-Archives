Bittergem looks so tasty
    But does it sound tasty? *Bitter*gem?
        Looks are more important than sounds
            To me, they honestly *look* bitter. Like, if I were looking at a piece of candy in that shade, I would expect it to be bitter.
                It would either taste like caramelized cotton candy or pink medicine. Like those jelly bean challenges people did back in the day but with minerals

                Yeah, I can imagine it tasting like medicine that's oversaturated with a cheap and awful tasting artificial grape flavoring.
                    I was thinking more like penicillin or pepto bismol flavor
                Watermelon Warheads
                I'm expecting sour, tbh
        Have you had sour candies before? Mmmmm
        Whoever discovered it must’ve been really hungry
        Giving it a name based on its taste implies it’s used culinarily, though. I imagine it’s maybe used similarly to “bitters” in mixed drinks, or maybe as some sort of spice.
        thats just what management wants you to think
    DRG named it that so the dwarves wouldnt eat them.. they wont stop me so easily
    It looks like it would taste like buggle bum flavored medicine.
I like the we’re rich ones
Red sugar and salt
    Just straight up a mouthfull of salt.
All of them >:)
    Friend! 🫂
        *presses “e” repeatedly*
    I run it's a bug thing on the regular, I will find you
Only reality and mind stones missing....
    Wouldn't Compressed Gold be the mind stone? Or would the yellow gems from that one machine event be better?
        Oh true, kursite could be the mind stone and compressed gold the soul stone
            Although, off the top of my head, I don't believe there are any red gems :[
                Ommoran heartstone!
                    Ooh that could work. Now we just need a driller dressed like Thanos
Bittergem: We're rich, it tastes deliciously bitter and its pink glow makes me look so fabulous.
    Green apple, blue raspberry, caramel, and I guess sour gum since it’s bitter.
I like the green flavor, tastes like schnozzberries.
    You're telling me that jadiz crystals don't taste like sour green apple?
        Umanite is definitely sour apple.
    “Who’s ever heard of a schnozzberry???”

-Mr Salt
Green or blue look tastiest for sure
bro collected the ROCKsmann STONEs
Greenbeard question (if you consider rank 20 a greenbeard), what is the pink one?
    Bittergem.

Gives around 1000 units which convert to money at the end of the mission (2 money per 1 bittergem unit).
    It's bittergem
        What do i get from it? Also, does it taste like sweet tart?
            You can find it buried in a wall just like compressed gold on any mission. Yes it does taste like sweet tart
    Bittergem
I enjoy error cubes, I like sticking them in my **ass** 




I mean Molly... Cause she's a reference to a donkey... Ass... Have I Ruined the joke yet?
    Hehe I also like sticking them in my ASS. Who’s molly?
GOOOLD
Jaspet

Aquarq: Cooling Mint

Jadiz: Sour Apple

Compressed Gold: a giant piece of the Gold Mine bubble gum
Cube
I like 'em round...

(Enor Pearl)
The one that makes us rich
Greens probably sour gimme that jadiz
I like the sour blue raspberry personally.
Bubblegum, Sour Apple, Icy Mint, Juicy Orange

i cant stop thinking bout the flavor possibilities
kursite
Bittergem just because it gives 1,200 per gem
A feast fit for a goron!
Find one more and you can summon Captain Planet.
200 hours in and I've never seen the pink one.
Love me a good jadiz
The green one tastes the best
🗣️aquarc
Wait how do you have an aquarq
Watermelon

Bittergem - Bubblegum

Compressed Gold - Metal idk (maybe lemon or orange)

Aquarq - Minty

Jadiz - Sour
Mineral
Blue flavour!
bubblegum :)
Pink we’re rich
Ubble gum 0w0
Pink is the prettiest, but I like Jadis the most. It tastes like elvish nightmares, so sweet.
was this taken in VR?
    and if not,why does it look like that?
Bismor!
Venture is that you?

Also, Aquarqs
It’s a tie between purple and gold
Strawberry
All that’s missing is the error cube
Jadiz is a Jolly rancher
Gold is a Werthers original
White is an Altoid

Not sure about bittergem
I use them as impromptu flares as much as possible, it always feels like gold chunks, enor pearls, and bittergems are the brightest.
The pink ones are too bitter for me.
Your mother.
GREEN
Big Management wants you to stop eating the rocks so they can hoard them all for themselves. Don't let Big Management tell you what to do.
I like the grape jolly ranchers
Ones make us go “We’re rich!”
Man i love the taste of **ERR://23¤Y%/**

I love the way it makes my mouth go **#%¢*&^§∆**
wtf is that 4:3 resolution?
Bitter Gem

Gives us the **”WERE RICH”** voice line and is worth a lot.
Goo sack
whichever one brings the most money!

  
Jokes aside I like the blue one, the glow is prettiest
I like it when my rocks taste green
Me likey purpol flayvr
Now you need a kursite deposit as well
Aquarks taste like blue Gatorade
Favorite flavor…? Probably ERR://23¤Y%/
Uranium-235
crunchy
Funny cucumber

Do they come in beer?
Honestly for me it's either Enor Pearl or Homoran hearthston
Give me geometric shapes with strange flavor please.
I don't care about the gems, but I have one question. 

WHY IS THIS CAVE LOOKING LIKE AN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN TEMPLE?
Now you just need to snap your fingers
Oh this puts a smile on my face
Two gunk seeds that are suspiciously close to each other.
I’ve always wondered if the akari’s actually tastes like green apple candy
Yes.
Bitter
Salty caramel
The pink one, I bet it tastes like bubble gum
Oooo infinity stones !
Compressed gold...it has the richest flavor
If you can accept gold being ironclad, then these can also represent the sts classes
I love all of em, but I cant lie I lowkey wanna eat the minerals, am I turning into a lootbug?
The 4 in one Dwarven ice cream special
The error cube, the d̷̨̡̡̰͠͠e̸̺̥̤̻̍̂̒̇f̷̹̜̤̝̐ą̸̤̀̀u̷̙̫͕͝ĺ̵̨̋̀̆ţ̴̲̬̩͛͐̏͂_f̶̣͇̗̆̎̍l̴͙̙̊a̸̳̾̒̅̕ṿ̶̟̣̺̔͘ō̸̖̬̯u̸͉̍̅̀͠r̶͇̤̙̿ ̵̥̇̆̉́
Holy shit, dude

That’s some RICH flavor
Aquarks are just blue raspberry jolly ranchers
What about the Karlok Tyrant Shards?
Hmm gold or (I forgot what the mink stuff was called.. too much red sugar?) one tastes like crunchy gum the other metallic coal which is quite nice.
Pink has a better flavor, but has that aftertaste that sticks with you far longer than it should.  Gold, on the other hand feels almost flavorless, but it makes for a great pallet cleanser
Blue Raspberry
Legendary picture tho
My hungry ass could not be a miner
I really like the ERR://23¤Y%/ one!
