[[The new boss is a mutated tyrant weed]]





How ... cool?

It will probably have some weakpoints that need to be foamed before it opens up.
    I would rather have you have to pop all the zits around it to open up the shell.
        Some of those are pretty high... Hope those jump boots really work
    That sounds like the antithesis of fun... unless they rework the foam cannons and vacs
        Yeah, using cleaning tools already feels a little clunky, in the heat of battle that could get even worse.
            You don't want to fly around the cave using rocket boots, spraying foam at stuff and vaccing it up?
                Yeah that sounds dope as all hell
            It could be that the infection has spread so much that each class gets another personal load out for foam only.
                I think that's highly unlikely, since the promo art shows dwarves combating the rockpox with their ordinary kit
                    I mean like, another option at the load-out screen like flares or armor, except it's a foam pistol.
        I dont know what you are talking about, i love foaming up stuff
            Hard agree.

I’d rather foam and vacuum than fight a tyrant weed any day
                Yeah! Tyrant Weed can be a huge pain if the terrain is bad. I guess that can be said about pretty the whole game, but it sometimes can have a big positional advantage.
        What do you mean, spraying my goo everywhere and having my friends suck it up is the best.
            Yeah but, imagine having to use the vac/foamer while also fighting a horde of rockpox glyphids while also targeting the boss with a weapon you can't hurt the glyphids with
        Yah, the cleaning tools are among my least favorite part of the game now - I hope they don’t add more. Or if they do add more, let them at least be multi purpose and do some actual damage…
        The entire act of dealing with rock pox got old by the second mission
            Meteors are cool tho
                Only the big ones.  I kinda hate the little ones since they disrupt so much of the map for so little reward.
        they just gotta make one that foams on leftclick and vacs in rightclick
            The whole point of the design is to make it a 2 dwarf job, hopefully while a third and maybe fourth dwarf provide(s) covering fire.

Remember, DRG is a coop game - most encounters and monster designs exist to support, encourage, and require cooperative tactics and teamwork.

Solo playability isn’t the point. And Bosco can vacuum anyway, so all you really need in solo is a foamer.
                Solo drg is so fun though. Load up the deep dive turn on some good tunes or a podcast/ audiobook and chill with bosco
    Oof
    Looks like mouth.
    I think those rock pox bulges would be it
    great another boss with tedious weak points
It's gunna be rough fighting this if it also has Korlok sprouts that constantly shoot projectiles. If you get stunned by rockpox, you might be dead in those couple seconds on haz 4-5.
    Yea that sounds kinda awful
        imagine its roots are tentacles and it walking around....
            If it has tentacles, it walking is the least of my concerns
    Imagine getting stunned by rock pox while on the jet pack then falling all the way down to your death.
        Better press those keys like your life depends on it


Oh wait, it does
        i believe that being frozen/infected disables fall damage, I'll test in about 20 minutes and come back with info

they do disable fall damage, got proof, lazy to post it
            I can also confirm that full Rockpox infection disables fall damage - source, it happened to me.
Tyrant weed is already bad enough and now we have it on steroids?? Naah man


Edit: oh crape i got 640 upvotes im rich


Edit2:wth 1.2k i didnt expect that
    If you’re looking for advice, I’ve found a fat boy PGL utterly ruins it and cancels all its healing. Rock and stone!
        Rock and Stone forever!

        Wait rly?
            Yeah. The radiation does more damage over time than the healing pods can heal. (Not sure about haz 5 though)
                Cuz i use hyper over fat boy
                    Fat boy is a little meh on haz 5 for big enemies imo. But fire is always good for tyrant weed. The weeds can't shoot when they are burning.
                        Fat boy isnt about the boom it's all about the radiation.The area denial is insane with a lure in it.
                        Just use hyper lmao
                            Can't plan in advance for when a korlok shows up. It's random. May not be running hyper prop for that mission.
                                I run hyper always, its the best pgl oc

                        Rock and Stone Brother
                        They can't? I had no idea. Nice!
                Aight i gotta try that
                    Tbh if you have a team that you can rely on to shoot the sprouts and pods then hyper propellant is probably better in terms of raw damage. But if you want to just fire and forget about it then fat boy is king
                        I mean i just like doing 70-80% dmg to prets and opressors
                The healing takes places after you reach the second phase of the health bar. It spawns 1 healing purple bulb, after the last phase it spawns 2. Once the center piece closes it stops taking damage from all sources (same as any enemy with a phase the health bar turns white instead of red).

So it will both be invulnerable and heal any damage you did until it opens again and you can shoot it again. 

Just shoot the healing parts after it closes, then go back to shooting the plane turrets, then back to the center when it opens and repeat.
        Alternatively, axe cancelling. The thing is weak to melee axes count as melee and deal big damage.
            AFAIK it has health gates, so there's a maximum amount of damage you can do to it every time it opens.

EDIT: This turned out to be only partially true. The Tyrant clam will close up after it's lost a certain amount of health and prevent further damage instances, but if you deal a huge chunk of damage to it in one tick - like from a supply pod impact or a Bulk explosion - the health gate won't cut off the damage, so you *can* one-shot the weed.
                True, but it still helps to do that damage as fast as possible. Less time spent fighting it means less time getting hit by the sprouts, and any bug spawns during the time fighting it rather than during the mission are just nitra sinks. Killing it faster saves health and nitra
                    That's fair. I guess what I'm saying is that I agree throwing axes and melee are a great way to damage it, but axe-cancelling doesn't really help that much.
                        Probably not, but it's pretty neat. Also at this point it's just habit anyway
            Yeah if I am playing driller at the time I take my barbed drills to it when it opens and it goes down fast
            Ace cancelling doesn't even work anymore
        The more i play the more i realise fat boy is the answer to everything
            In a Game where overwhelming firepower will solve 90% of your problems, it is yes
        Rock and stone to the bone! Also thanks
        The only solution is to run 4 engies 4 phat bois on every mission in case you run into a tyrant
        But doesn't it heals while immune to damage?
        the hardest counter to Korlok: 1 fat boy, 1 hyperpropellant. eat half its health in 0.5 seconds and deny healing
        Even better advice, fire stuns the sprouts and they stop shooting.
        Alternatively a hyper propellent to delete it's health chunks
        This makes me even sadder that I still didn't get the fat boy OC yet
    Tyrant Weed is anywhere from a cakewalk to an extremely difficult encounter — and it is always, always just the *terrain* that makes the difference. 

Honorary mention to meteors triggering it when you are not prepared.

Another honorary mention to every time Doretta wakes it up like a dunce.
        My most memorable fight against one was in the lava biome on an Aquarq mission. It was on a high ledge and its sprouts were spread out across 4 or 5 different areas.

It was a nightmare.
            mine was also in the lava biome. the "heart" spawned in a corridor alone, while all the sprouts were in the room next to it, behind a wall. Luckily, I was playing in co-op, so my allies were able to just hang out in the room with the sprouts, and I shot the heart when it opened.

I don't think I would've been able to kill it in solo due to how badly placed the sprouts were.
            My first was the worst, solo, never seen one before, don't know mechanics, I come out of a passage into the bottom of a pit with the heart, unbeknownst to me the other sprouts were all along the rim up top.  

I don't know this until I start platforming stairs up the side and get downed without seeing where the shots are coming from.  

All the rest since then've been much easier, even the healing from the ceiling.
            Worst was my buddy and I finding it, in the deepest point of a radioactive exclusion zone mining expedition. The cave gen was massive, we where on haz 4, we had virtually no nitra and I was running sludge, epc driller, my friend was m1000 scout. We had finished a meteor, the last of the morkite was a pain to collect and then we find this korlak, go for it and basically hit zero ammo with no nitra. We finished the weed off, which was a pain because it was spawning sprouts/healing pods in different levels/areas because the heart was on a weird ledge. We finish off by the tiniest amount and a swarm pops when the drop pod is inbound, which results in us having to rapidly return to the drop pod while swarmed. I fully ran out of ammo and so did he, and at that point the scooby do music kicked in as we spent the next minute running in circles kiting the swarm of enemies while molly slowly returned to the drop pod. We got out, but that fight was a huge pain. Lots of laughs and fun on the extract part though, but one of the most tense missions I have been on.
        I was on a mission where dottie woke it up and killed it also. I thought it would just trigger it to open. Nope one punch dottie showed up.
            > one punch dottie showed up.

Fun until she runs over a bulk while the whole team is standing on her
                yup we had that happen
                I’ve had that happen with a Crassus. Scared the hell out of everyone.
                Thats when the "Please excuse the interruption" screen pops up.
            I do love Dotty!
        Best tip I can give for dealing with a tyrant is don't engage it if you dont have to. You can always run past it if it's blocking some dirt. It's a plant. It cant follow you and it goes inactive after a short period of non engagement. Fight it when you are ready. It's not going anywhere. Even if something else triggers it, if noone engages it, it will go in active again. Also any damage inflicted to it past a gate will not be healed when it goes inactive. So disengage if you feel you cant beat it in one go. Hit and run if you have to. But make sure you kill the healing pods. Even then it can heal past a gate.
        The first time I encountered a tyrant weed, a meteor triggered right afterwards and landed on it, killing it.  I had no idea what I had just seen.

Those things have definitely been the toughest enemy for me as I've started doing haz 4 missions.  The difficulty of most enemies moving up hazard levels feels pretty linear.  Those tyrant weeds feel exponential.

        Or, my personal favorite experience, having your Driller casually doot doot it with the wavecooker and then wander off with the rest of the team to gather minerals below the weed.

I emptied the entirety of my primary, secondary, and grenades trying to take the thing out while my team fucked off (but stayed within it's aggro radius, so it wouldn't sleep), before realizing help wasn't coming, and just leaving the lobby.
    More like a virus mutation. A steroid virus mutation.
    If the virus rules apply, then it'll have big yellow weakspots that let you kill it in 3 shots.
        It looks from the image like you need to use the lithofoam/lithovac combo to defeat it.
    What’s a tyrant weed?
        It's a mean Green mother from outerspace and it's Bad. A miniboss. You will encounter soon enough ROCK AND STONE!
            Ok, if this mutated version pops up with the name Audrey I'm going to lose it
                Audrey 2, Da doo! But anyway, I hope we'll fight somewhere that's green when it's suppertime for that plant. The way we will beat that mouth up will make us dentists, I just hope that it'll grow for me so that I can have some fun now. I'll punch this plant downtown and when I'm done it will scream feed me before it Gids it! Don't feed the plants, or else ya become leaflovers! ROCK AND STONE!
            Rock and Stone everyone!
            Rock and stone
        Oh, my sweet summer child...
            Lol I only have like 13 hours in game and I’ve only gone up to hazard 3
                It's all good young one. You will learn in time. Find some grey beards and hang with them for a bit. They'll show you the ropes when you encounter one.
                Don’t worry, like the nemesis it can spawn in any map regardless of hazard.
                    Dang I guess I have to play more
        A vegetable hydra
    Do you have 180 nitra though
    They found something worse than grabbers.
    Just order a resupply on it and time it right, it takes out two thirds of its health
    Tyrant weed is still my favorite random encounter in the game
    We're rich! We're rich! We're rich!
Probably the most reasonable guess I've heard so far. Looks quite similar, you're right.
I still wonna know why the dwarves have rocket boots
    Might be randomly occuring temporary equipment
        Maybe old equipment left behind, like lost packs and cargo crates

Management's budget has clearly gone down
            I'm betting that Management finally invested in some better equipment, but the shuttle pilot dumped the rocket boots just like they did with all the seasonal stuff.
                This is genius

- Mission Control
            They must have ROCKet powered boots...hah get it?
                ☝️🤓 Legally speaking....
    Probably because of rock and even, stone.
        Yeahhhh ROCK AND STONE!
            That's it lads! Rock and Stone!
    To fight space bugs
    Everyone just used Hover Boots for the picture.
    Where do we see them with rocket boots?
        See the full picture
            Oh well now that I've seen the full pic it's clearly an equipment drop. You can see it with the icon floating above it.
                Yes agreed
    thicc goblin engineers have finally been hired to upgrade our equipment.
    Kneepads are still on backorder.
Whats next mutated robots(beside betsy) bruh mutated omen or armored ebonite mutated praetorians?
    Rockpox infected, ebonite mutated, rival augmented, xynarch suckered, Error Gold glitched Crassus ~~detonator~~ Dreadonator.
        On death: deletes the whole map
            So treat it like the unknown terror then
    rockpoxxed xynarch charge-suckered molly that just runs away from you when you get close
People realy be hating on tyrant weed, but imo its not bad enemy
    It can go from a fairly easy fight to an absolute pain in the ass so fast depending on the terrain and any potential enemy spawns

A Korlok chilling out in the open with the latest swarm having just been dealt with? Not too bad, just shoot sprouts, damage core and destroy healing pods. A Korlok with sprouts all over the place with the core on a ledge high up in the cave ceiling with little caves for the healing pods to appear in with a bulk detonator or Cave horror roaming nearby? Yeah this shits gonna hurt
        Worst I've dealt with is a haunted cace mactera plague on a salvage mission in azure weald i think. It spawned on a basically floating rock where realistically only our scout could go and our driller managed to down him there. Fun times and a really intense and rewarding mission. 10/10 would do it again.
        Also depends on whether your team is any good
            Also on the weapons you carry.
A weakpoint focused build does OK. A damage over time, control or area effect build is near useless.
            That too but I'd argue that's more of an overarching modifier whereas the Korlok is just a plant, much like how player count and hazard level also affect the fight
        Recently had one spawn in a deep pit. I ended up falling into the pit while trying to shoot at it. I didn't survive very long...
    I don't think it's *bad* per say, but it definitely has outright absurd difficulty swings tied to terrain generation. Out in the open it's a complete pushover as long as the team has most basic knowledge about it. On the other hand if it spawns awkwardly with healing pods often being on different levels (or outright different caverns) it can go to a massive pain that requires high coordination, especially from the scout and driller.

Part of the "problem" is also how it spawning in an escort can very easily doom the mission.
        That would have to be a very bad spawn - stop for refueling under a cliff with fuel nowhere nearby and fewer than two teammates kind of bad. Korlocks are easier to ignore than other hazards.
        >	Part of the “problem” is also how it spawning in an escort can very easily doom the mission.

Some of the most exciting drops I’ve ever played has been where this has happened.  Separates the dwarves from the elves.
    Tyrant weed is absolute trash when it spawns spread out over multiple covered areas. The constant running around trying to find the tentacles as it heals back to full health is borderline unbeatable in some terrain settings.
    It definitely is one of the most fun in the game. People be hating on difficulty in a pretty easy game
    As a Driller main who plays on Haz 5 with a sludge pump DOT build it can be stupidly brutal. Especially depending on what your team is packing. Any dot build is painful against them and it can absolutely fail a mission. Especially when the sprouts shoot way above or way below due to terrible terrain. It can be brutal at higher levels and becomes something over time I’ve dreaded to find in the caves.
For now, let's just hope that whatever it is, it stays stationary... oT
No it can't be
    *"All, for nothing at all" by Murders starts playing*
        lol it's murders by miracle musical
            Damn, YouTube lied to me.
Looks like harold to me
I really hope so! They are super fun to fight, especially with it's extra RNG with how it ends up being placed.
I wonder if it will be more like the caretaker with the tentacles instead of robot arms
    My money is on a lot of similarities to things already in the game, just like you said. Seems like they reuse assets as much as they can as the updates are progressing. Not that that is a bad thing.
        Correct, why mess with perfection. I think that it will combine aspects of the caretaker with the tyrant weed, then sprinkle a little rockpox in there
    Could be
Pour some beer on it problem solved
My very first thought on seeing the outline in the teaser picture was that is was clearly some kind of mutated korlok weed. 


It looks like you defeat it by spraying it with foam and vacuuming it off, that'd be interesting
imagine that the weed is trying to get the rockpox off itself but can't so when you beat the rockpox off the boss it's becomes a friendly plant boss named george. Just like beating bet-c
Craziest discovery since Newton invented evolution in 1359
Ah yes. He’s no longer a tyrant weed. He is a democratic representative weed! 

(He represents the Rockpox and he strongly encourages all of us to vote in favor of getting sick and dying)
Yea i can see it, tho because of the mouth and flesh and distinct lack of infected korlok spitters i believe its likely the final stage of a plague heart’s life cycle. What they become after being left alone and not taken or destroyed
No it isn't. It's the next stage of a plagueheart after turning into a spike.

Plaguehearts also have the two "flaps" and "roots".
Post unclear, requires more red circles and arrows.
O shit I did not see that bloody hell you have better eyes than me
Whatever it is, it needs to die
Gentelmen! Fat Boys at the ready!

    I think it’s wood, not leaves
Well ain’t you so smart
I also saw a post that it could be a mutated brood Nexus. It would be cool if it's some mutated fucked up mix of things we already fight
Aligns with that one tidbit teaser for S4 we got forever ago around the time jet packs were mentioned that went something like 
“The plants in the depths of hoxxes are stirring. Some say they’re mad even”
Ah, flaps and roots. The core curriculum of Xenobiology 101.
I believe they’re called “labia minora”
So it opens up? Cool, that makes a nice convenient place to hold C4.
Could be the meteorite itself is what’s up and walking now
Oh no tyrant weed on steroids...this will not go great for anyone who plays on warning missions on haz 4-5
i was thinking this was an infected version of the brood nexus that spits out full grown glyphids and possibly other infected enemies
Honestly of all the creatures it feels like the Korlok is just *there* so it's nice to see it get some time in the spotlight even if it is probably, you know, suffering.
i was thinking its like an infecrted dreadnuaght cocoon
Iam staying next to the brood nexus theory
Yeah this mates WAY more senese
Man why is everyone posting So much about Harold like he is Just vibing
Harold 👍

ROCK AND STONE TO THE BONE
    Rock and Stone to the Bone!
        Good bot
Did i hear a rock and stone?
    We fight for Rock and Stone!
Idk, maybe you're right, but it looks more like a mutated Brood Nexus to me.

The Brood Nexus also has roots or tentacles near the base, and is larger than the main tyrant pod; and what you're calling flaps just looks like rockpox to me.
Its not, its a brood nexus
    Then why does it have this gap in the middle
        because rockpox?
            I mean yes that might be the reason, but it’s a bit stretched
                No, its not. its already oval shaped like a brood nexus, and its got 2 yellow dots where a nexus would have its own 2 green dots. But please, by all means, stick to your opinion. Don’t let logic dissuade you.
                    My goal is not to prove that I’m right, I just want to be as close to being true as much as possible. I may be wrong about korlok, that’s why I’m asking you questions, not to prove you wrong, but to prove me wrong if I am. Also i want to know what you would say about the “root” things
                        I would say that those are a by product of the rockpox. In reality, this thing is more likely to be a brood nexus given the fact that it would explain the new glyphid units. If it were a korlok weed, then where did the new glyphids come from? Rockpox doesn’t make new glyphids, it infects them. However, a brood nexus infected by rockpox would in all likelihood have its ability to create glyphids mutated by the rockpox which would result in new creations.

Additionally, the 2 yellow spots resemble the green ones found on a regular brood nexus, which is another indicator that it is not a korlok weed.

Also, when a korlok weed attacks, it does not directly lash out at you from the main plant, it sends tendrils from underground or it flings projectiles at you. Here, we can clearly see the creature has tendrils emanating from its own body

Not to mention, the fanged orifice on the side of one of its segments would be another area that the new glyphids could originate from.

Is that enough for you?
I already ignore any Tyrants I see, ya think imma fight a harder one?
It's more of a asset flip than actual plagued weed/lore piece 

Still would be pretty cool to explain it that way lore wise ig
    I don't think you know what an asset flip is
        Ah yes I bet the copium must taste nice 

But ig we will see when it comes to actually see in it in game plus is the op that said it looks like tentacle weed I'm just drawing conclusions from it
            He is stating you don't know what an asset flip is. For example, simply changing the color of something and calling it a new thing. 

At most, you can call a ghost bulk an asset flip but when you consider the change in its texture, colors, noises, etc. It very well is a good asset flip. Most would call it a ghost bulk before thinking of it as an asset flip as it's obvious there was some consideration into making it rather than being lazy and just changing the color in a bad scenario.

Calling it an asset flip has a bad connotation to it. 

This new enemy clearly is nothing close to that. You can say it's inspired or borrows elements (as OP actually said). There would be no need fore speculation if it was as simple as "asset flip, we all know exactly what it is and will do, let's move on."
                Wouldn't a better example of an asset flip be the snow/ice variants of goo bombers and praetorians
                    Yeah, you're right, lol.
                Asset flipping a technical term for a type of shovelware where the devs would by asset packs (available on things like the Unity Store) and cobble together a basic, generic gaming experience, and sell that. Digital Homicide is a good example of that but that shouldn't be confused with all shovelware. One of the BIG companies that did shovelware would be DDI, they would make shallow 10 minute long games using an engine they designed to make it easier called the GODS engine. 

&#x200B;

Calling anything from GSG an 'asset flip' is a fundamental misunderstand on what asset flipping is. The devs made all the models themselves. Yes, they did buy models when developing the game but those are all gone, replaced with the glyphids we all know now.
                But by that definition IF the new Plague nexus thing IS infected weed then that means it's a flipped asset of the weed creature with changed visuals but the base model would still be an asset from the weed creature no?

And btw I ain't saying it's a bad thing just saying what it could be cuz let's not forget we haven't seen it in game only on game/season announcement art
                    What exactly are you seeing that they both share ? I get something simple like shapes, but that's as far as it goes. Oval with lines...

No, it clearly isn't the same model as the weed. Even the small speculations are very clearly different. 

Again, OP is saying they LOOK similar.
                        Omg please read again what I said just slowly cuz I don't think you get my point 

To give you a hand I never said they are or will be IF is a key word here it's a speculation based on random observation no more no less yet yous make a deal about it
                            "Ah yes spores, tentacles, a mouth, etc. Oh but wait, a oval and lines. Clearly an asset flip of a tyrant weed, aka a another spawner asset flip."
                                Wow you feeling okay? Again never said those things and it's the op you should have a go at no me lol 

But I do appreciate the afternoon entrainment
                                    Seems like it is, in fact, you, that is huffing the copium.
                    That's not an asset flip. Asset flipping is a type of shovelware, making a new enemy model is the farthest thing from it. You want to see what an asset flip is, look up Digital Homicide. THAT'S an asset flip. Yeah, it might be an infected enemy but this is a totally different model that we've never encountered before. You have absolutely no grasp on what an asset flip is. To be an asset flip, by definition as you liked to put it, the model had to have been pre-made and purchased by the devs. To expand further, that would have to be the whole game. Everything from the guns, terrain, enemies, had to have been pre-made and purchased, slapped together, and resold as an 'original' game. Again, Digital Homicide studio was infamous for this but the practice continues. In fact, I know of a Switch game that is a baseless asset flip, [Popeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW0d4k1JlSI). THIS is an asset flip, the new enemy is not. This is like someone building a new care but decided to use an engine that's a bit older and having someone walk up and shout 'this is a copy of that other car' without understand either.
                        You people sure like to write essays
                            you really need to get better counters man
Well gee I’m in fear now.
Genuinely forgot they existed but cool
Oh Yeah tyrant weed exists
i have been wondering   
will this thing be it own boss in a mission or smth like the bulks detonators
    I'm thinking its own mission type, like the rival caretaker
    Good question
This is .. Terran requiem, yes.
What if it's nothing mutated, and what it is that the meteor was just an egg and it's converted now it's landed?
For Karl!!
Thanks for proving this lmao
So it's just going to be Caretaker but plant then
I’m so excited to rock Harold’s shit
Korlok Gargant
Oooh that's gonna be fun
Tyrant coke joining the party
Speaking of which, I haven't seen one in a long time! I wonder why....wait a minute
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
no no NO NO NO!!!
I knew it's gonna be a korlok
Definitely a mutated brood nexus, here's a snippet of the brood nexus description.

"It's theorized that the Brood Nexus is a completely separate genus, somehow able to replicate the DNA of other species, and use their "designs" for its own protection."

Plus it sort of looks like it has "eyes" in roughly the same spot.
Anima is that you?
I think is a mutated  lithopage meteorite it has the exact same form and height
    Actually this was my first idea when I saw it, then I thought it was a mutated dread cocoon, and only then I remembered korlok. But it’d be cool if it actually is a meteor
I did not think that that those were roots I thought that those were legs
    That would be terrifying
Korlok was scary enough already! I'm shaking in my hoverboots!
Knew it!
Im still kinda shocked at how close my Guess was 

I just thought that the husk/shields were similar to the tyrant weed
YES
Nah it's just a funky piece of corn
No no no thats the mother of the loot bugs silly
Im sorry, is it really a Boss? Or you guys just speculating? 
Seems to me it’s just a rooted thing locked in place that can spawn monsters
    Pure speculation, but I had to call it something
Man, I HOPE so. There's so much lore from machine events and stuff like this that has never been followed up on, it'd be really cool to learn more about them. Like, why are the weeds there what are they, etc etc. What's Kursite? So on and so forth.

More tyrant weed lore would be amazing
thats just Harold and Maude... you leave them alone.
Hell ya
Feed me, Seymour!
Hopefully all things get new mutated forms
FOREFATHERS ONE AND ALL! GET ME OUTTA HERE!
It's a tyrant weed mutated by rockpox given just the look with the colors matching both the tyrant weed and the rockpox boils color, maybe the tyrant weed is enough geneticly similar to animals that the rock pox infection (fungi?) Could take it over to increase the spread of the rockpox.
My least favourite part of foaming and dealing with spikes is just the fact that I can instantly tell there’s one around when I lose half of my frames.
I think it's a rocpox version of the glyphid brood nexus
Korloks fuck me up from time to time. This is gonna be tough. Rock and stone!
But is it Harold!?!?
Looks like a rat king.
It would make more sense if it was a brood nexus since we already know the pox can infect glyphids but its not crazy to think it could mutate to infect korloks and spitball infesters
Of course.

Set Flamer from grill to EXTRA CHARRED, Drillers XD
Korlok Dictator Weed?
Harold 👍
Idgaf what it is

Rock and Stone!
    For Karl!
The skin on the top left of it looks like a lootbug's skin, I'm putting my bets on lootbugs under the pox
No shit.
It's also in the logo too, I highly doubt it would be anything else.
Looks more like a brood nexus to me.

I think (and kinda hope) that it will be something entirely new.
I wonder if it’ll grab you and put you in one of the mouths and people will have to shoot it to get it to drop you
                     Rockweed Tyrant Lord

🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧     🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧     🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧
⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️
I just wanna point out the fact that the logo for season 4 does just straight up have a tyrant weed on it so that even further supports this.
There finally giving the Tyrant Weed more attention then. I feel like it’s pretty much the only thing in drg that can BE forgotten
I would rather have you have to pop all the zits around it to open up the shell.
    Some of those are pretty high... Hope those jump boots really work
That sounds like the antithesis of fun... unless they rework the foam cannons and vacs
    Yeah, using cleaning tools already feels a little clunky, in the heat of battle that could get even worse.
        You don't want to fly around the cave using rocket boots, spraying foam at stuff and vaccing it up?
            Yeah that sounds dope as all hell
        It could be that the infection has spread so much that each class gets another personal load out for foam only.
            I think that's highly unlikely, since the promo art shows dwarves combating the rockpox with their ordinary kit
                I mean like, another option at the load-out screen like flares or armor, except it's a foam pistol.
    I dont know what you are talking about, i love foaming up stuff
        Hard agree.

I’d rather foam and vacuum than fight a tyrant weed any day
            Yeah! Tyrant Weed can be a huge pain if the terrain is bad. I guess that can be said about pretty the whole game, but it sometimes can have a big positional advantage.
    What do you mean, spraying my goo everywhere and having my friends suck it up is the best.
        Yeah but, imagine having to use the vac/foamer while also fighting a horde of rockpox glyphids while also targeting the boss with a weapon you can't hurt the glyphids with
    Yah, the cleaning tools are among my least favorite part of the game now - I hope they don’t add more. Or if they do add more, let them at least be multi purpose and do some actual damage…
    The entire act of dealing with rock pox got old by the second mission
        Meteors are cool tho
            Only the big ones.  I kinda hate the little ones since they disrupt so much of the map for so little reward.
    they just gotta make one that foams on leftclick and vacs in rightclick
        The whole point of the design is to make it a 2 dwarf job, hopefully while a third and maybe fourth dwarf provide(s) covering fire.

Remember, DRG is a coop game - most encounters and monster designs exist to support, encourage, and require cooperative tactics and teamwork.

Solo playability isn’t the point. And Bosco can vacuum anyway, so all you really need in solo is a foamer.
            Solo drg is so fun though. Load up the deep dive turn on some good tunes or a podcast/ audiobook and chill with bosco
Oof
Looks like mouth.
I think those rock pox bulges would be it
great another boss with tedious weak points
Yea that sounds kinda awful
    imagine its roots are tentacles and it walking around....
        If it has tentacles, it walking is the least of my concerns
Imagine getting stunned by rock pox while on the jet pack then falling all the way down to your death.
    Better press those keys like your life depends on it


Oh wait, it does
    i believe that being frozen/infected disables fall damage, I'll test in about 20 minutes and come back with info

they do disable fall damage, got proof, lazy to post it
        I can also confirm that full Rockpox infection disables fall damage - source, it happened to me.
If you’re looking for advice, I’ve found a fat boy PGL utterly ruins it and cancels all its healing. Rock and stone!
    Rock and Stone forever!

    Wait rly?
        Yeah. The radiation does more damage over time than the healing pods can heal. (Not sure about haz 5 though)
            Cuz i use hyper over fat boy
                Fat boy is a little meh on haz 5 for big enemies imo. But fire is always good for tyrant weed. The weeds can't shoot when they are burning.
                    Fat boy isnt about the boom it's all about the radiation.The area denial is insane with a lure in it.
                    Just use hyper lmao
                        Can't plan in advance for when a korlok shows up. It's random. May not be running hyper prop for that mission.
                            I run hyper always, its the best pgl oc
                                [deleted]
                    Rock and Stone Brother
                    They can't? I had no idea. Nice!
            Aight i gotta try that
                Tbh if you have a team that you can rely on to shoot the sprouts and pods then hyper propellant is probably better in terms of raw damage. But if you want to just fire and forget about it then fat boy is king
                    I mean i just like doing 70-80% dmg to prets and opressors
            The healing takes places after you reach the second phase of the health bar. It spawns 1 healing purple bulb, after the last phase it spawns 2. Once the center piece closes it stops taking damage from all sources (same as any enemy with a phase the health bar turns white instead of red).

So it will both be invulnerable and heal any damage you did until it opens again and you can shoot it again. 

Just shoot the healing parts after it closes, then go back to shooting the plane turrets, then back to the center when it opens and repeat.
    Alternatively, axe cancelling. The thing is weak to melee axes count as melee and deal big damage.
        AFAIK it has health gates, so there's a maximum amount of damage you can do to it every time it opens.

EDIT: This turned out to be only partially true. The Tyrant clam will close up after it's lost a certain amount of health and prevent further damage instances, but if you deal a huge chunk of damage to it in one tick - like from a supply pod impact or a Bulk explosion - the health gate won't cut off the damage, so you *can* one-shot the weed.
            True, but it still helps to do that damage as fast as possible. Less time spent fighting it means less time getting hit by the sprouts, and any bug spawns during the time fighting it rather than during the mission are just nitra sinks. Killing it faster saves health and nitra
                That's fair. I guess what I'm saying is that I agree throwing axes and melee are a great way to damage it, but axe-cancelling doesn't really help that much.
                    Probably not, but it's pretty neat. Also at this point it's just habit anyway
        Yeah if I am playing driller at the time I take my barbed drills to it when it opens and it goes down fast
        Ace cancelling doesn't even work anymore
    The more i play the more i realise fat boy is the answer to everything
        In a Game where overwhelming firepower will solve 90% of your problems, it is yes
    Rock and stone to the bone! Also thanks
    The only solution is to run 4 engies 4 phat bois on every mission in case you run into a tyrant
    But doesn't it heals while immune to damage?
    the hardest counter to Korlok: 1 fat boy, 1 hyperpropellant. eat half its health in 0.5 seconds and deny healing
    Even better advice, fire stuns the sprouts and they stop shooting.
    Alternatively a hyper propellent to delete it's health chunks
    This makes me even sadder that I still didn't get the fat boy OC yet
Tyrant Weed is anywhere from a cakewalk to an extremely difficult encounter — and it is always, always just the *terrain* that makes the difference. 

Honorary mention to meteors triggering it when you are not prepared.

Another honorary mention to every time Doretta wakes it up like a dunce.
    My most memorable fight against one was in the lava biome on an Aquarq mission. It was on a high ledge and its sprouts were spread out across 4 or 5 different areas.

It was a nightmare.
        mine was also in the lava biome. the "heart" spawned in a corridor alone, while all the sprouts were in the room next to it, behind a wall. Luckily, I was playing in co-op, so my allies were able to just hang out in the room with the sprouts, and I shot the heart when it opened.

I don't think I would've been able to kill it in solo due to how badly placed the sprouts were.
        My first was the worst, solo, never seen one before, don't know mechanics, I come out of a passage into the bottom of a pit with the heart, unbeknownst to me the other sprouts were all along the rim up top.  

I don't know this until I start platforming stairs up the side and get downed without seeing where the shots are coming from.  

All the rest since then've been much easier, even the healing from the ceiling.
        Worst was my buddy and I finding it, in the deepest point of a radioactive exclusion zone mining expedition. The cave gen was massive, we where on haz 4, we had virtually no nitra and I was running sludge, epc driller, my friend was m1000 scout. We had finished a meteor, the last of the morkite was a pain to collect and then we find this korlak, go for it and basically hit zero ammo with no nitra. We finished the weed off, which was a pain because it was spawning sprouts/healing pods in different levels/areas because the heart was on a weird ledge. We finish off by the tiniest amount and a swarm pops when the drop pod is inbound, which results in us having to rapidly return to the drop pod while swarmed. I fully ran out of ammo and so did he, and at that point the scooby do music kicked in as we spent the next minute running in circles kiting the swarm of enemies while molly slowly returned to the drop pod. We got out, but that fight was a huge pain. Lots of laughs and fun on the extract part though, but one of the most tense missions I have been on.
    I was on a mission where dottie woke it up and killed it also. I thought it would just trigger it to open. Nope one punch dottie showed up.
        > one punch dottie showed up.

Fun until she runs over a bulk while the whole team is standing on her
            yup we had that happen
            I’ve had that happen with a Crassus. Scared the hell out of everyone.
            Thats when the "Please excuse the interruption" screen pops up.
        I do love Dotty!
    Best tip I can give for dealing with a tyrant is don't engage it if you dont have to. You can always run past it if it's blocking some dirt. It's a plant. It cant follow you and it goes inactive after a short period of non engagement. Fight it when you are ready. It's not going anywhere. Even if something else triggers it, if noone engages it, it will go in active again. Also any damage inflicted to it past a gate will not be healed when it goes inactive. So disengage if you feel you cant beat it in one go. Hit and run if you have to. But make sure you kill the healing pods. Even then it can heal past a gate.
    The first time I encountered a tyrant weed, a meteor triggered right afterwards and landed on it, killing it.  I had no idea what I had just seen.

Those things have definitely been the toughest enemy for me as I've started doing haz 4 missions.  The difficulty of most enemies moving up hazard levels feels pretty linear.  Those tyrant weeds feel exponential.

    Or, my personal favorite experience, having your Driller casually doot doot it with the wavecooker and then wander off with the rest of the team to gather minerals below the weed.

I emptied the entirety of my primary, secondary, and grenades trying to take the thing out while my team fucked off (but stayed within it's aggro radius, so it wouldn't sleep), before realizing help wasn't coming, and just leaving the lobby.
More like a virus mutation. A steroid virus mutation.
If the virus rules apply, then it'll have big yellow weakspots that let you kill it in 3 shots.
    It looks from the image like you need to use the lithofoam/lithovac combo to defeat it.
What’s a tyrant weed?
    It's a mean Green mother from outerspace and it's Bad. A miniboss. You will encounter soon enough ROCK AND STONE!
        Ok, if this mutated version pops up with the name Audrey I'm going to lose it
            Audrey 2, Da doo! But anyway, I hope we'll fight somewhere that's green when it's suppertime for that plant. The way we will beat that mouth up will make us dentists, I just hope that it'll grow for me so that I can have some fun now. I'll punch this plant downtown and when I'm done it will scream feed me before it Gids it! Don't feed the plants, or else ya become leaflovers! ROCK AND STONE!
        Rock and Stone everyone!
        Rock and stone
    Oh, my sweet summer child...
        Lol I only have like 13 hours in game and I’ve only gone up to hazard 3
            It's all good young one. You will learn in time. Find some grey beards and hang with them for a bit. They'll show you the ropes when you encounter one.
            Don’t worry, like the nemesis it can spawn in any map regardless of hazard.
                Dang I guess I have to play more
    A vegetable hydra
Do you have 180 nitra though
They found something worse than grabbers.
Just order a resupply on it and time it right, it takes out two thirds of its health
Tyrant weed is still my favorite random encounter in the game
We're rich! We're rich! We're rich!
Might be randomly occuring temporary equipment
    Maybe old equipment left behind, like lost packs and cargo crates

Management's budget has clearly gone down
        I'm betting that Management finally invested in some better equipment, but the shuttle pilot dumped the rocket boots just like they did with all the seasonal stuff.
            This is genius

Everyone just used Hover Boots for the picture.
Where do we see them with rocket boots?

        Oh well now that I've seen the full pic it's clearly an equipment drop. You can see it with the icon floating above it.
            Yes agreed

It can go from a fairly easy fight to an absolute pain in the ass so fast depending on the terrain and any potential enemy spawns

A Korlok chilling out in the open with the latest swarm having just been dealt with? Not too bad, just shoot sprouts, damage core and destroy healing pods. A Korlok with sprouts all over the place with the core on a ledge high up in the cave ceiling with little caves for the healing pods to appear in with a bulk detonator or Cave horror roaming nearby? Yeah this shits gonna hurt
    Worst I've dealt with is a haunted cace mactera plague on a salvage mission in azure weald i think. It spawned on a basically floating rock where realistically only our scout could go and our driller managed to down him there. Fun times and a really intense and rewarding mission. 10/10 would do it again.
    Also depends on whether your team is any good
        Also on the weapons you carry.
A weakpoint focused build does OK. A damage over time, control or area effect build is near useless.
        That too but I'd argue that's more of an overarching modifier whereas the Korlok is just a plant, much like how player count and hazard level also affect the fight
    Recently had one spawn in a deep pit. I ended up falling into the pit while trying to shoot at it. I didn't survive very long...
I don't think it's *bad* per say, but it definitely has outright absurd difficulty swings tied to terrain generation. Out in the open it's a complete pushover as long as the team has most basic knowledge about it. On the other hand if it spawns awkwardly with healing pods often being on different levels (or outright different caverns) it can go to a massive pain that requires high coordination, especially from the scout and driller.

Part of the "problem" is also how it spawning in an escort can very easily doom the mission.
    That would have to be a very bad spawn - stop for refueling under a cliff with fuel nowhere nearby and fewer than two teammates kind of bad. Korlocks are easier to ignore than other hazards.
    >	Part of the “problem” is also how it spawning in an escort can very easily doom the mission.

Some of the most exciting drops I’ve ever played has been where this has happened.  Separates the dwarves from the elves.
Tyrant weed is absolute trash when it spawns spread out over multiple covered areas. The constant running around trying to find the tentacles as it heals back to full health is borderline unbeatable in some terrain settings.
It definitely is one of the most fun in the game. People be hating on difficulty in a pretty easy game
As a Driller main who plays on Haz 5 with a sludge pump DOT build it can be stupidly brutal. Especially depending on what your team is packing. Any dot build is painful against them and it can absolutely fail a mission. Especially when the sprouts shoot way above or way below due to terrible terrain. It can be brutal at higher levels and becomes something over time I’ve dreaded to find in the caves.
*"All, for nothing at all" by Murders starts playing*
    lol it's murders by miracle musical
        Damn, YouTube lied to me.
My money is on a lot of similarities to things already in the game, just like you said. Seems like they reuse assets as much as they can as the updates are progressing. Not that that is a bad thing.
    Correct, why mess with perfection. I think that it will combine aspects of the caretaker with the tyrant weed, then sprinkle a little rockpox in there
Could be
I think it’s wood, not leaves
Rock and Stone to the Bone!
    Good bot
We fight for Rock and Stone!
Then why does it have this gap in the middle
    because rockpox?
        I mean yes that might be the reason, but it’s a bit stretched
            No, its not. its already oval shaped like a brood nexus, and its got 2 yellow dots where a nexus would have its own 2 green dots. But please, by all means, stick to your opinion. Don’t let logic dissuade you.
                My goal is not to prove that I’m right, I just want to be as close to being true as much as possible. I may be wrong about korlok, that’s why I’m asking you questions, not to prove you wrong, but to prove me wrong if I am. Also i want to know what you would say about the “root” things
                    I would say that those are a by product of the rockpox. In reality, this thing is more likely to be a brood nexus given the fact that it would explain the new glyphid units. If it were a korlok weed, then where did the new glyphids come from? Rockpox doesn’t make new glyphids, it infects them. However, a brood nexus infected by rockpox would in all likelihood have its ability to create glyphids mutated by the rockpox which would result in new creations.

Additionally, the 2 yellow spots resemble the green ones found on a regular brood nexus, which is another indicator that it is not a korlok weed.

Also, when a korlok weed attacks, it does not directly lash out at you from the main plant, it sends tendrils from underground or it flings projectiles at you. Here, we can clearly see the creature has tendrils emanating from its own body

Not to mention, the fanged orifice on the side of one of its segments would be another area that the new glyphids could originate from.

Is that enough for you?
I don't think you know what an asset flip is
    Ah yes I bet the copium must taste nice 

But ig we will see when it comes to actually see in it in game plus is the op that said it looks like tentacle weed I'm just drawing conclusions from it
        He is stating you don't know what an asset flip is. For example, simply changing the color of something and calling it a new thing. 

At most, you can call a ghost bulk an asset flip but when you consider the change in its texture, colors, noises, etc. It very well is a good asset flip. Most would call it a ghost bulk before thinking of it as an asset flip as it's obvious there was some consideration into making it rather than being lazy and just changing the color in a bad scenario.

Calling it an asset flip has a bad connotation to it. 

This new enemy clearly is nothing close to that. You can say it's inspired or borrows elements (as OP actually said). There would be no need fore speculation if it was as simple as "asset flip, we all know exactly what it is and will do, let's move on."
            Wouldn't a better example of an asset flip be the snow/ice variants of goo bombers and praetorians
                Yeah, you're right, lol.
            Asset flipping a technical term for a type of shovelware where the devs would by asset packs (available on things like the Unity Store) and cobble together a basic, generic gaming experience, and sell that. Digital Homicide is a good example of that but that shouldn't be confused with all shovelware. One of the BIG companies that did shovelware would be DDI, they would make shallow 10 minute long games using an engine they designed to make it easier called the GODS engine. 

&#x200B;

Calling anything from GSG an 'asset flip' is a fundamental misunderstand on what asset flipping is. The devs made all the models themselves. Yes, they did buy models when developing the game but those are all gone, replaced with the glyphids we all know now.
            But by that definition IF the new Plague nexus thing IS infected weed then that means it's a flipped asset of the weed creature with changed visuals but the base model would still be an asset from the weed creature no?

And btw I ain't saying it's a bad thing just saying what it could be cuz let's not forget we haven't seen it in game only on game/season announcement art
                What exactly are you seeing that they both share ? I get something simple like shapes, but that's as far as it goes. Oval with lines...

No, it clearly isn't the same model as the weed. Even the small speculations are very clearly different. 

Again, OP is saying they LOOK similar.
                    Omg please read again what I said just slowly cuz I don't think you get my point 

To give you a hand I never said they are or will be IF is a key word here it's a speculation based on random observation no more no less yet yous make a deal about it
                        "Ah yes spores, tentacles, a mouth, etc. Oh but wait, a oval and lines. Clearly an asset flip of a tyrant weed, aka a another spawner asset flip."
                            Wow you feeling okay? Again never said those things and it's the op you should have a go at no me lol 

But I do appreciate the afternoon entrainment
                                Seems like it is, in fact, you, that is huffing the copium.
                That's not an asset flip. Asset flipping is a type of shovelware, making a new enemy model is the farthest thing from it. You want to see what an asset flip is, look up Digital Homicide. THAT'S an asset flip. Yeah, it might be an infected enemy but this is a totally different model that we've never encountered before. You have absolutely no grasp on what an asset flip is. To be an asset flip, by definition as you liked to put it, the model had to have been pre-made and purchased by the devs. To expand further, that would have to be the whole game. Everything from the guns, terrain, enemies, had to have been pre-made and purchased, slapped together, and resold as an 'original' game. Again, Digital Homicide studio was infamous for this but the practice continues. In fact, I know of a Switch game that is a baseless asset flip, [Popeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW0d4k1JlSI). THIS is an asset flip, the new enemy is not. This is like someone building a new care but decided to use an engine that's a bit older and having someone walk up and shout 'this is a copy of that other car' without understand either.
                    You people sure like to write essays
                        you really need to get better counters man
I'm thinking its own mission type, like the rival caretaker
Good question
Actually this was my first idea when I saw it, then I thought it was a mutated dread cocoon, and only then I remembered korlok. But it’d be cool if it actually is a meteor
That would be terrifying
Pure speculation, but I had to call it something
For Karl!
Some of those are pretty high... Hope those jump boots really work
Yeah, using cleaning tools already feels a little clunky, in the heat of battle that could get even worse.
    You don't want to fly around the cave using rocket boots, spraying foam at stuff and vaccing it up?
        Yeah that sounds dope as all hell
    It could be that the infection has spread so much that each class gets another personal load out for foam only.
        I think that's highly unlikely, since the promo art shows dwarves combating the rockpox with their ordinary kit
            I mean like, another option at the load-out screen like flares or armor, except it's a foam pistol.
I dont know what you are talking about, i love foaming up stuff
    Hard agree.

I’d rather foam and vacuum than fight a tyrant weed any day
        Yeah! Tyrant Weed can be a huge pain if the terrain is bad. I guess that can be said about pretty the whole game, but it sometimes can have a big positional advantage.
What do you mean, spraying my goo everywhere and having my friends suck it up is the best.
    Yeah but, imagine having to use the vac/foamer while also fighting a horde of rockpox glyphids while also targeting the boss with a weapon you can't hurt the glyphids with
Yah, the cleaning tools are among my least favorite part of the game now - I hope they don’t add more. Or if they do add more, let them at least be multi purpose and do some actual damage…
The entire act of dealing with rock pox got old by the second mission
    Meteors are cool tho
        Only the big ones.  I kinda hate the little ones since they disrupt so much of the map for so little reward.
they just gotta make one that foams on leftclick and vacs in rightclick
    The whole point of the design is to make it a 2 dwarf job, hopefully while a third and maybe fourth dwarf provide(s) covering fire.

Remember, DRG is a coop game - most encounters and monster designs exist to support, encourage, and require cooperative tactics and teamwork.

Solo playability isn’t the point. And Bosco can vacuum anyway, so all you really need in solo is a foamer.
        Solo drg is so fun though. Load up the deep dive turn on some good tunes or a podcast/ audiobook and chill with bosco
imagine its roots are tentacles and it walking around....
    If it has tentacles, it walking is the least of my concerns
Better press those keys like your life depends on it


Oh wait, it does
i believe that being frozen/infected disables fall damage, I'll test in about 20 minutes and come back with info

they do disable fall damage, got proof, lazy to post it
    I can also confirm that full Rockpox infection disables fall damage - source, it happened to me.
Rock and Stone forever!

Wait rly?
    Yeah. The radiation does more damage over time than the healing pods can heal. (Not sure about haz 5 though)
        Cuz i use hyper over fat boy
            Fat boy is a little meh on haz 5 for big enemies imo. But fire is always good for tyrant weed. The weeds can't shoot when they are burning.
                Fat boy isnt about the boom it's all about the radiation.The area denial is insane with a lure in it.
                Just use hyper lmao
                    Can't plan in advance for when a korlok shows up. It's random. May not be running hyper prop for that mission.
                        I run hyper always, its the best pgl oc
                            [deleted]
                Rock and Stone Brother
                They can't? I had no idea. Nice!
        Aight i gotta try that
            Tbh if you have a team that you can rely on to shoot the sprouts and pods then hyper propellant is probably better in terms of raw damage. But if you want to just fire and forget about it then fat boy is king
                I mean i just like doing 70-80% dmg to prets and opressors
        The healing takes places after you reach the second phase of the health bar. It spawns 1 healing purple bulb, after the last phase it spawns 2. Once the center piece closes it stops taking damage from all sources (same as any enemy with a phase the health bar turns white instead of red).

So it will both be invulnerable and heal any damage you did until it opens again and you can shoot it again. 

Just shoot the healing parts after it closes, then go back to shooting the plane turrets, then back to the center when it opens and repeat.
Alternatively, axe cancelling. The thing is weak to melee axes count as melee and deal big damage.
    AFAIK it has health gates, so there's a maximum amount of damage you can do to it every time it opens.

EDIT: This turned out to be only partially true. The Tyrant clam will close up after it's lost a certain amount of health and prevent further damage instances, but if you deal a huge chunk of damage to it in one tick - like from a supply pod impact or a Bulk explosion - the health gate won't cut off the damage, so you *can* one-shot the weed.
        True, but it still helps to do that damage as fast as possible. Less time spent fighting it means less time getting hit by the sprouts, and any bug spawns during the time fighting it rather than during the mission are just nitra sinks. Killing it faster saves health and nitra
            That's fair. I guess what I'm saying is that I agree throwing axes and melee are a great way to damage it, but axe-cancelling doesn't really help that much.
                Probably not, but it's pretty neat. Also at this point it's just habit anyway
    Yeah if I am playing driller at the time I take my barbed drills to it when it opens and it goes down fast
    Ace cancelling doesn't even work anymore
The more i play the more i realise fat boy is the answer to everything
    In a Game where overwhelming firepower will solve 90% of your problems, it is yes
Rock and stone to the bone! Also thanks
The only solution is to run 4 engies 4 phat bois on every mission in case you run into a tyrant
But doesn't it heals while immune to damage?
the hardest counter to Korlok: 1 fat boy, 1 hyperpropellant. eat half its health in 0.5 seconds and deny healing
Even better advice, fire stuns the sprouts and they stop shooting.
Alternatively a hyper propellent to delete it's health chunks
This makes me even sadder that I still didn't get the fat boy OC yet
My most memorable fight against one was in the lava biome on an Aquarq mission. It was on a high ledge and its sprouts were spread out across 4 or 5 different areas.

It was a nightmare.
    mine was also in the lava biome. the "heart" spawned in a corridor alone, while all the sprouts were in the room next to it, behind a wall. Luckily, I was playing in co-op, so my allies were able to just hang out in the room with the sprouts, and I shot the heart when it opened.

I don't think I would've been able to kill it in solo due to how badly placed the sprouts were.
    My first was the worst, solo, never seen one before, don't know mechanics, I come out of a passage into the bottom of a pit with the heart, unbeknownst to me the other sprouts were all along the rim up top.  

I don't know this until I start platforming stairs up the side and get downed without seeing where the shots are coming from.  

All the rest since then've been much easier, even the healing from the ceiling.
    Worst was my buddy and I finding it, in the deepest point of a radioactive exclusion zone mining expedition. The cave gen was massive, we where on haz 4, we had virtually no nitra and I was running sludge, epc driller, my friend was m1000 scout. We had finished a meteor, the last of the morkite was a pain to collect and then we find this korlak, go for it and basically hit zero ammo with no nitra. We finished the weed off, which was a pain because it was spawning sprouts/healing pods in different levels/areas because the heart was on a weird ledge. We finish off by the tiniest amount and a swarm pops when the drop pod is inbound, which results in us having to rapidly return to the drop pod while swarmed. I fully ran out of ammo and so did he, and at that point the scooby do music kicked in as we spent the next minute running in circles kiting the swarm of enemies while molly slowly returned to the drop pod. We got out, but that fight was a huge pain. Lots of laughs and fun on the extract part though, but one of the most tense missions I have been on.
I was on a mission where dottie woke it up and killed it also. I thought it would just trigger it to open. Nope one punch dottie showed up.
    > one punch dottie showed up.

Fun until she runs over a bulk while the whole team is standing on her
        yup we had that happen
        I’ve had that happen with a Crassus. Scared the hell out of everyone.
        Thats when the "Please excuse the interruption" screen pops up.
    I do love Dotty!
Best tip I can give for dealing with a tyrant is don't engage it if you dont have to. You can always run past it if it's blocking some dirt. It's a plant. It cant follow you and it goes inactive after a short period of non engagement. Fight it when you are ready. It's not going anywhere. Even if something else triggers it, if noone engages it, it will go in active again. Also any damage inflicted to it past a gate will not be healed when it goes inactive. So disengage if you feel you cant beat it in one go. Hit and run if you have to. But make sure you kill the healing pods. Even then it can heal past a gate.
The first time I encountered a tyrant weed, a meteor triggered right afterwards and landed on it, killing it.  I had no idea what I had just seen.

Those things have definitely been the toughest enemy for me as I've started doing haz 4 missions.  The difficulty of most enemies moving up hazard levels feels pretty linear.  Those tyrant weeds feel exponential.

Or, my personal favorite experience, having your Driller casually doot doot it with the wavecooker and then wander off with the rest of the team to gather minerals below the weed.

I emptied the entirety of my primary, secondary, and grenades trying to take the thing out while my team fucked off (but stayed within it's aggro radius, so it wouldn't sleep), before realizing help wasn't coming, and just leaving the lobby.
It looks from the image like you need to use the lithofoam/lithovac combo to defeat it.
It's a mean Green mother from outerspace and it's Bad. A miniboss. You will encounter soon enough ROCK AND STONE!
    Ok, if this mutated version pops up with the name Audrey I'm going to lose it
        Audrey 2, Da doo! But anyway, I hope we'll fight somewhere that's green when it's suppertime for that plant. The way we will beat that mouth up will make us dentists, I just hope that it'll grow for me so that I can have some fun now. I'll punch this plant downtown and when I'm done it will scream feed me before it Gids it! Don't feed the plants, or else ya become leaflovers! ROCK AND STONE!
    Rock and Stone everyone!
    Rock and stone
Oh, my sweet summer child...
    Lol I only have like 13 hours in game and I’ve only gone up to hazard 3
        It's all good young one. You will learn in time. Find some grey beards and hang with them for a bit. They'll show you the ropes when you encounter one.
        Don’t worry, like the nemesis it can spawn in any map regardless of hazard.
            Dang I guess I have to play more
A vegetable hydra
Maybe old equipment left behind, like lost packs and cargo crates

Management's budget has clearly gone down
    I'm betting that Management finally invested in some better equipment, but the shuttle pilot dumped the rocket boots just like they did with all the seasonal stuff.
        This is genius
        "I'M GONNA KILL THAT SHUTTLE PILOT!"

- Mission Control
    They must have ROCKet powered boots...hah get it?
        ☝️🤓 Legally speaking....
Yeahhhh ROCK AND STONE!
    That's it lads! Rock and Stone!
See the full picture
    Oh well now that I've seen the full pic it's clearly an equipment drop. You can see it with the icon floating above it.
        Yes agreed
On death: deletes the whole map
    So treat it like the unknown terror then
Worst I've dealt with is a haunted cace mactera plague on a salvage mission in azure weald i think. It spawned on a basically floating rock where realistically only our scout could go and our driller managed to down him there. Fun times and a really intense and rewarding mission. 10/10 would do it again.
Also depends on whether your team is any good
    Also on the weapons you carry.
A weakpoint focused build does OK. A damage over time, control or area effect build is near useless.
    That too but I'd argue that's more of an overarching modifier whereas the Korlok is just a plant, much like how player count and hazard level also affect the fight
Recently had one spawn in a deep pit. I ended up falling into the pit while trying to shoot at it. I didn't survive very long...
That would have to be a very bad spawn - stop for refueling under a cliff with fuel nowhere nearby and fewer than two teammates kind of bad. Korlocks are easier to ignore than other hazards.
>	Part of the “problem” is also how it spawning in an escort can very easily doom the mission.

Some of the most exciting drops I’ve ever played has been where this has happened.  Separates the dwarves from the elves.
lol it's murders by miracle musical
    Damn, YouTube lied to me.
Correct, why mess with perfection. I think that it will combine aspects of the caretaker with the tyrant weed, then sprinkle a little rockpox in there
Good bot
because rockpox?
    I mean yes that might be the reason, but it’s a bit stretched
        No, its not. its already oval shaped like a brood nexus, and its got 2 yellow dots where a nexus would have its own 2 green dots. But please, by all means, stick to your opinion. Don’t let logic dissuade you.
            My goal is not to prove that I’m right, I just want to be as close to being true as much as possible. I may be wrong about korlok, that’s why I’m asking you questions, not to prove you wrong, but to prove me wrong if I am. Also i want to know what you would say about the “root” things
                I would say that those are a by product of the rockpox. In reality, this thing is more likely to be a brood nexus given the fact that it would explain the new glyphid units. If it were a korlok weed, then where did the new glyphids come from? Rockpox doesn’t make new glyphids, it infects them. However, a brood nexus infected by rockpox would in all likelihood have its ability to create glyphids mutated by the rockpox which would result in new creations.

Additionally, the 2 yellow spots resemble the green ones found on a regular brood nexus, which is another indicator that it is not a korlok weed.

Also, when a korlok weed attacks, it does not directly lash out at you from the main plant, it sends tendrils from underground or it flings projectiles at you. Here, we can clearly see the creature has tendrils emanating from its own body

Not to mention, the fanged orifice on the side of one of its segments would be another area that the new glyphids could originate from.

Is that enough for you?
Ah yes I bet the copium must taste nice 

But ig we will see when it comes to actually see in it in game plus is the op that said it looks like tentacle weed I'm just drawing conclusions from it
    He is stating you don't know what an asset flip is. For example, simply changing the color of something and calling it a new thing. 

At most, you can call a ghost bulk an asset flip but when you consider the change in its texture, colors, noises, etc. It very well is a good asset flip. Most would call it a ghost bulk before thinking of it as an asset flip as it's obvious there was some consideration into making it rather than being lazy and just changing the color in a bad scenario.

Calling it an asset flip has a bad connotation to it. 

This new enemy clearly is nothing close to that. You can say it's inspired or borrows elements (as OP actually said). There would be no need fore speculation if it was as simple as "asset flip, we all know exactly what it is and will do, let's move on."
        Wouldn't a better example of an asset flip be the snow/ice variants of goo bombers and praetorians
            Yeah, you're right, lol.

In a Game where overwhelming firepower will solve 90% of your problems, it is yes
mine was also in the lava biome. the "heart" spawned in a corridor alone, while all the sprouts were in the room next to it, behind a wall. Luckily, I was playing in co-op, so my allies were able to just hang out in the room with the sprouts, and I shot the heart when it opened.

I don't think I would've been able to kill it in solo due to how badly placed the sprouts were.
My first was the worst, solo, never seen one before, don't know mechanics, I come out of a passage into the bottom of a pit with the heart, unbeknownst to me the other sprouts were all along the rim up top.  

I don't know this until I start platforming stairs up the side and get downed without seeing where the shots are coming from.  

All the rest since then've been much easier, even the healing from the ceiling.
Worst was my buddy and I finding it, in the deepest point of a radioactive exclusion zone mining expedition. The cave gen was massive, we where on haz 4, we had virtually no nitra and I was running sludge, epc driller, my friend was m1000 scout. We had finished a meteor, the last of the morkite was a pain to collect and then we find this korlak, go for it and basically hit zero ammo with no nitra. We finished the weed off, which was a pain because it was spawning sprouts/healing pods in different levels/areas because the heart was on a weird ledge. We finish off by the tiniest amount and a swarm pops when the drop pod is inbound, which results in us having to rapidly return to the drop pod while swarmed. I fully ran out of ammo and so did he, and at that point the scooby do music kicked in as we spent the next minute running in circles kiting the swarm of enemies while molly slowly returned to the drop pod. We got out, but that fight was a huge pain. Lots of laughs and fun on the extract part though, but one of the most tense missions I have been on.
> one punch dottie showed up.

Fun until she runs over a bulk while the whole team is standing on her
    yup we had that happen
    I’ve had that happen with a Crassus. Scared the hell out of everyone.
    Thats when the "Please excuse the interruption" screen pops up.
I do love Dotty!
Ok, if this mutated version pops up with the name Audrey I'm going to lose it
    Audrey 2, Da doo! But anyway, I hope we'll fight somewhere that's green when it's suppertime for that plant. The way we will beat that mouth up will make us dentists, I just hope that it'll grow for me so that I can have some fun now. I'll punch this plant downtown and when I'm done it will scream feed me before it Gids it! Don't feed the plants, or else ya become leaflovers! ROCK AND STONE!
Rock and Stone everyone!
Rock and stone
Lol I only have like 13 hours in game and I’ve only gone up to hazard 3
    It's all good young one. You will learn in time. Find some grey beards and hang with them for a bit. They'll show you the ropes when you encounter one.
    Don’t worry, like the nemesis it can spawn in any map regardless of hazard.
        Dang I guess I have to play more
I'm betting that Management finally invested in some better equipment, but the shuttle pilot dumped the rocket boots just like they did with all the seasonal stuff.
    This is genius

They must have ROCKet powered boots...hah get it?
    ☝️🤓 Legally speaking....
That's it lads! Rock and Stone!
Oh well now that I've seen the full pic it's clearly an equipment drop. You can see it with the icon floating above it.
    Yes agreed
So treat it like the unknown terror then
Also on the weapons you carry.
A weakpoint focused build does OK. A damage over time, control or area effect build is near useless.
That too but I'd argue that's more of an overarching modifier whereas the Korlok is just a plant, much like how player count and hazard level also affect the fight
Damn, YouTube lied to me.
I mean yes that might be the reason, but it’s a bit stretched
    No, its not. its already oval shaped like a brood nexus, and its got 2 yellow dots where a nexus would have its own 2 green dots. But please, by all means, stick to your opinion. Don’t let logic dissuade you.
        My goal is not to prove that I’m right, I just want to be as close to being true as much as possible. I may be wrong about korlok, that’s why I’m asking you questions, not to prove you wrong, but to prove me wrong if I am. Also i want to know what you would say about the “root” things
            I would say that those are a by product of the rockpox. In reality, this thing is more likely to be a brood nexus given the fact that it would explain the new glyphid units. If it were a korlok weed, then where did the new glyphids come from? Rockpox doesn’t make new glyphids, it infects them. However, a brood nexus infected by rockpox would in all likelihood have its ability to create glyphids mutated by the rockpox which would result in new creations.

Additionally, the 2 yellow spots resemble the green ones found on a regular brood nexus, which is another indicator that it is not a korlok weed.

Also, when a korlok weed attacks, it does not directly lash out at you from the main plant, it sends tendrils from underground or it flings projectiles at you. Here, we can clearly see the creature has tendrils emanating from its own body

Not to mention, the fanged orifice on the side of one of its segments would be another area that the new glyphids could originate from.

Is that enough for you?
He is stating you don't know what an asset flip is. For example, simply changing the color of something and calling it a new thing. 

At most, you can call a ghost bulk an asset flip but when you consider the change in its texture, colors, noises, etc. It very well is a good asset flip. Most would call it a ghost bulk before thinking of it as an asset flip as it's obvious there was some consideration into making it rather than being lazy and just changing the color in a bad scenario.

Calling it an asset flip has a bad connotation to it. 

This new enemy clearly is nothing close to that. You can say it's inspired or borrows elements (as OP actually said). There would be no need fore speculation if it was as simple as "asset flip, we all know exactly what it is and will do, let's move on."
    Wouldn't a better example of an asset flip be the snow/ice variants of goo bombers and praetorians
        Yeah, you're right, lol.
    Asset flipping a technical term for a type of shovelware where the devs would by asset packs (available on things like the Unity Store) and cobble together a basic, generic gaming experience, and sell that. Digital Homicide is a good example of that but that shouldn't be confused with all shovelware. One of the BIG companies that did shovelware would be DDI, they would make shallow 10 minute long games using an engine they designed to make it easier called the GODS engine. 

&#x200B;

Calling anything from GSG an 'asset flip' is a fundamental misunderstand on what asset flipping is. The devs made all the models themselves. Yes, they did buy models when developing the game but those are all gone, replaced with the glyphids we all know now.
    But by that definition IF the new Plague nexus thing IS infected weed then that means it's a flipped asset of the weed creature with changed visuals but the base model would still be an asset from the weed creature no?

And btw I ain't saying it's a bad thing just saying what it could be cuz let's not forget we haven't seen it in game only on game/season announcement art
        What exactly are you seeing that they both share ? I get something simple like shapes, but that's as far as it goes. Oval with lines...

No, it clearly isn't the same model as the weed. Even the small speculations are very clearly different. 

Again, OP is saying they LOOK similar.
            Omg please read again what I said just slowly cuz I don't think you get my point 

To give you a hand I never said they are or will be IF is a key word here it's a speculation based on random observation no more no less yet yous make a deal about it
                "Ah yes spores, tentacles, a mouth, etc. Oh but wait, a oval and lines. Clearly an asset flip of a tyrant weed, aka a another spawner asset flip."
                    Wow you feeling okay? Again never said those things and it's the op you should have a go at no me lol 

But I do appreciate the afternoon entrainment
                        Seems like it is, in fact, you, that is huffing the copium.
        That's not an asset flip. Asset flipping is a type of shovelware, making a new enemy model is the farthest thing from it. You want to see what an asset flip is, look up Digital Homicide. THAT'S an asset flip. Yeah, it might be an infected enemy but this is a totally different model that we've never encountered before. You have absolutely no grasp on what an asset flip is. To be an asset flip, by definition as you liked to put it, the model had to have been pre-made and purchased by the devs. To expand further, that would have to be the whole game. Everything from the guns, terrain, enemies, had to have been pre-made and purchased, slapped together, and resold as an 'original' game. Again, Digital Homicide studio was infamous for this but the practice continues. In fact, I know of a Switch game that is a baseless asset flip, [Popeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW0d4k1JlSI). THIS is an asset flip, the new enemy is not. This is like someone building a new care but decided to use an engine that's a bit older and having someone walk up and shout 'this is a copy of that other car' without understand either.
            You people sure like to write essays
                you really need to get better counters man
Yeah that sounds dope as all hell
I think that's highly unlikely, since the promo art shows dwarves combating the rockpox with their ordinary kit
    I mean like, another option at the load-out screen like flares or armor, except it's a foam pistol.
Yeah! Tyrant Weed can be a huge pain if the terrain is bad. I guess that can be said about pretty the whole game, but it sometimes can have a big positional advantage.
Only the big ones.  I kinda hate the little ones since they disrupt so much of the map for so little reward.
Solo drg is so fun though. Load up the deep dive turn on some good tunes or a podcast/ audiobook and chill with bosco

Good human
Good bison!
Cuz i use hyper over fat boy
    Fat boy is a little meh on haz 5 for big enemies imo. But fire is always good for tyrant weed. The weeds can't shoot when they are burning.
        Fat boy isnt about the boom it's all about the radiation.The area denial is insane with a lure in it.
        Just use hyper lmao
            Can't plan in advance for when a korlok shows up. It's random. May not be running hyper prop for that mission.
                I run hyper always, its the best pgl oc

        Rock and Stone Brother
        They can't? I had no idea. Nice!
Aight i gotta try that
    Tbh if you have a team that you can rely on to shoot the sprouts and pods then hyper propellant is probably better in terms of raw damage. But if you want to just fire and forget about it then fat boy is king
        I mean i just like doing 70-80% dmg to prets and opressors
The healing takes places after you reach the second phase of the health bar. It spawns 1 healing purple bulb, after the last phase it spawns 2. Once the center piece closes it stops taking damage from all sources (same as any enemy with a phase the health bar turns white instead of red).

So it will both be invulnerable and heal any damage you did until it opens again and you can shoot it again. 

Just shoot the healing parts after it closes, then go back to shooting the plane turrets, then back to the center when it opens and repeat.
True, but it still helps to do that damage as fast as possible. Less time spent fighting it means less time getting hit by the sprouts, and any bug spawns during the time fighting it rather than during the mission are just nitra sinks. Killing it faster saves health and nitra
    That's fair. I guess what I'm saying is that I agree throwing axes and melee are a great way to damage it, but axe-cancelling doesn't really help that much.
        Probably not, but it's pretty neat. Also at this point it's just habit anyway
yup we had that happen
