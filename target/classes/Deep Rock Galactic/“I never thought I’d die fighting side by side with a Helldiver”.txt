[[“I never thought I’d die fighting side by side with a Helldiver”]]





They fight on top, we fight in the deep.
    Absa-fuckin-lutely my head cannon
        Mine is that the Helldivers are fighting this war elsewhere in the galaxy and the Dwarves have been employed to mine the minerals at Hoxxes IV needed for the war effort as well as doing field testing for some of their weapons
            I like to imagine that the Dwarves are just so completely drunk that every planet is Hoxxes IV to them, and they're killing the nests completely while the divers take out the entrances so none can escape.
                I like to think the Dwarves are also running all of the tech from the ship, scurrying along the companionways and pushing every big red button that says "boom" they can find
                    Y e s
                I like that head cannon
                I’ve seen memes where a squad of Helldivers are being overwhelmed only for the dwarves of DRG to emerge from the ground to provide extra fire support while shouting “DIE YOU DAMN BUGS!!”
                    You can’t just say that and not provide a link

            DRG is probably making a killing by being one of the sole suppliers of some rare, volatile ores n materials needed for Super Earth’s war effort
            Releasing classified info is treason
                Oh, I know. Thankfully, I'm not a World of Tanks player
        Just realized that both the dwarves and the helldivers are fighting both bugs AND robots.
            Hell yea
            the two long-standing enemies of humanity. bugs and robots.
            Standard sci fi enemies that won’t increase the age rating like fighting people that bleed red blood will

            helldiver joining dwarves: tries to call in stratagems, supremely confused why none of them are working, still happy to shoot bugs

dwarf joining helldivers: no idea what the hell all this "democracy" stuff is about, upset about being on the surface, still happy to shoot bugs
                Helldiver soldier: “so you guys go deep into a planets caves to mine out its resources for credits promotions and cool new ways to kill bugs?”

DRG dwarf employee: “ya telling meh that you come down in a ball of fire, hit the ground unscaved, shoot bugs for “*democracy*” if ya survive you also get promotions and cool new ways to kill bugs?”

Both:”…cheers I drink to that.”
                Meanwhile, on the Western Front: Dwarves screaming in binary
                    Dwarves have some experience fighting robots.
                        No, please. I can’t. Not again. I can’t go back, I CANNOT GO BAAAACK!      /s
                        Nothing prepares you for The ‘Creek
                            i might be the exception but i would rather fight bots any day than bugs. 

Especially on higher difficulties the bugs are just so aggresive if you arent killing basically everything instantly they will just chase you, slow you and kill you but if you see a bunch of bots you can fall back into cover, call airstrikes without fear a bile titan is going to rush your position and step on you.
                                I used to feel this way until I started getting swarmed by rockets and armor.

If a robot can see you, it's a problem. Bugs are not a problem until they are all the way up on you. The shield generator is the real difference here, you can practically infinitely kite bugs. But robots will wear you down and synergize well with each other.

Plus their armored units are more of a problem. Dreadnaughts and walkers are spammable, dangerous, and aggressive. And that's before I even get to rocket and tank accuracy. By god those tanks and turrets have snipers on the helm.

I did a 180. I used to mow down automatons with the grenade launcher. Now that I'm on higher difficulties, I can solo helldive bugs...but robots, robots scare me.

Drop pods a bile Titan

"that still only counts as one"
    "Not to me."
    I did that! And then got caught under it's corpse while I was swarmed to death.
        It happens more often than not so no surprise there
        Got pinned in the prone under one, I was safe from bugs, but couldn’t get out until the body despawned. I sat they’re shooting my arc thrower out into the bugs piling over me… making the body pile around me deeper.
            Had a buddy who dived into a dead charger and was stuck so I was asked to shoot him but as soon as I aim and pull the trigger all I hear him say is "Oh I'm free" couldn't help but laugh xD
    Yesterday I killed a bile titan by being reinforced onto it. It was awesome!

                    Telling someone to not rock and stone is far more 'leaf lover' than rock and stoning a leaf lover.
                        Rock n stone to rock n stone but Don’t rock n stone to bloody leaf loving!
                            I don't think the divers' Idea of democracy is elfish
                            I mean he has a point but ppl still hate him
                    Good bots follow orders. It’s been a double-agent this whole time.
                    The Helldivers kill bugs and robots, they may not drink, they may stand 7 feet tall, but they ain't no leaf lover. Though they are different from us, we share the same goal.
    Tea?! Sounds like leaf lover talk /s
        clearly liber-tea is an alcoholic beverage
            If any tax-man ask, remember, it a tea!
            Liber-tea is a mockery to tea, it's clearly a beer but named tea to insult the British (not democratic). Worthy of rocks and stones
            It probably has gunpowder in it.
        Very true. I’ll be sure to criticize their choice in beverages as we’re stomping bugs.
            A skilled brewer can make tea of the alcoholic variety, so it isn't all bad.
            I mean at least those starship trooper guys drank beer! It wasn't a dwarven beer so it was shit beer, but it was still beer!
                Things can be taught

        If you think the flamethrower is strong you should try impact mixture on the sludge pump. Build for normal shot damage, use the charge shot on groups, and the normal shot on tough or single targets.

The last alliance of men, dwarves, and Bosco 




Whaddya mean elves? No one can stand those pricks.
When cross over
    It’s already happening, why do you think Helldivers are only ever above ground?
        Helldivers gets a shot of caves when the bugs cover them up completely and extinguish the generous skies.

For reals, one time I had crawled in a crack and covered in bugs. I said, fuck it, threw a grenade and got ready to drop back XD
            I love dropping a panic orbital on myself when i get swarmed!
Realistically, the Helldivers would be sent in to execute the Dwarves for being unionized. Or, well, they'd certainly try~.
    Why do you think the unions been various degrees of non functional for several years
        Hey, say what you want, but Dwarves are a hell of a lot less disposable to DRG than Helldivers are to SE (just not less disposable than a clutch of mini-mules).
            dwarfs matter enough for them to leave the pod in what is essentially a pissed off fire ant nest for 5 minutes risking the entire haul so they can be retrieved, if dwarfs and helldivers met theyd be in shock to hear the other sides usual mission
Helldiver: *fires a shot at the insectoid between his legs*

Dwarf: it was already dead.

H: it was twitching.

D: it was twitching... Because I got my pick EMBEDDED IN ITS NERVOUS SYSTEM.
FOR DEMOCRACY AND KARL !
    Would Karl and the ‘GUARDDOG’ get along ya think?
        I think the guarddog would help the bartender back in the hub. As for Karl, he would find every mortar left on the field and enjoy a cup of LIBER\_THEA as he watches destruction rain down, before getting up and pissing on their corpses.
They should add hoxxes to the galactic map
    It would be liberated so hard...
    There could be a whole area on the edge of the map called something like "dwarven territory" or "mining sector" with a bunch of systems under DRG control.

They wouldn't be enemy held territory because DRG could supply Super Earth and DRG already operates on mostly uninhabitable planets, so SE wouldn't really need those systems anyway.

The rivals and glyphids could be a good enemy here too. The rivals being an "automaton force designed specifically for the conquest of that sector" and the glyphids just being glyphids.
i kinda wonder what the makers of drg, helldivers and lethal company think about all the cross over stuff, could you imagine if they decided to say screw it and say the games all take place in the same universe?
    Well that's what among us did with other indie games. I guess with enough time and determination it could happen

I'm so down for it tho. I really want to liberate the mines of hoxxes while a team of red suited guys with shovels, jetpacks and boomboxes get dropped into a warzone on their ship.
This is beautiful
    Is it ever, it's like your friend from work and your childhood friend getting along. Good times are had all around.
SKIN MADE OF IRON, STEEL IN OUR BONES!

Ugh, the feels
I want to play that game so bad. But it's not on Xbox yet. 😢
Can’t believe Votann and The Imperial Guard fighting along side to defeat Tyranids
For some reason i thought he is a crewmate from the company
    No, that’s my next piece 🤫
        Damn
But what type of brews do the divers have?
    The liberty type
C4 and an eagle strike beacon simultaneously land at their feet...
I like the think the dwarves don't really care where they are, they're happy to just be killing some bugs. Even more so now they have some new friends to do it along side
i found myself enjoying helldriver as a huge Deep Rock Galactic fan and its hard for me to find a game i usually replay often.
It is absolutely a credit to both of these dev teams that these two games are so beloved by their players.

If they could agree on a canon way to mesh the two games with a crossover event, I would be absolutely up for it.

(Suggestion: Helldivers liberate Hoxxes IV from the tyranids. Dwarves find missing armor in the mines for a Helldiver...)
I don’t care they’re linked no matter what you say. The dwarves are helping the soldiers keep fighting.
"I never thought I'd die fighting side by side with a surface dweller" would fit better in my opinion. For rock and stone. And to LiBeerTy.
    Rock and Stone everyone!
Reminds me of the Legion of the Dead and the Grey Warden's in Dragon Age: Origins
Total bait but you earned it

Edit:*sucks nitrous*
TAKE MY UPVOTE
For Liberty and Stone!
Crossover event requested. We need a suit/helmet based on the Helldiver's armor and we should call it "Hoxxesdiver." Don't know what helldiver's should do though. 🤔

Bug breaches are just bugs running from the dwarves
I love that so many people brought together Deep Rock and Helldivers,  two wonderful games
Steeve in helldivers when?
    I will shoot you myself if you try to reason with the enemy
FOR ROCK AND STONE! AND FOR DEMOCRACY!
    Rockity Rock and Stone!
It's my head canon that helldivers and DRG takes place in the same universe. The only diff is that in DRG, you're playing as an employee of a mining Corp and in helldivers you're part of the military.
Helldiver really living rent free in DRG huh
    Both I found lmfao, someone even said that they could add Easter eggs into each game and people would go ape shit, like finding a pickaxe and broken down Molly in Helldivers and the like
Helldivers squish the bugs topside and the dwarves head below. Same goal
    Dwarfs goal is not to kill bugs but to mine. Bugs just stand in theyr way
Meanwhile the Darktide Zealot is already in the middle of the horde and shouting "Heresy"
A conversation of war cries overheard at the battle of Hoxxes Creek prior to the conflict between the United Liberation Forces of Brotherhood:
"ROCK AND STONE, YOU BEAUTIFUL PATRIOTS!"
"FOR LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY, MINERS!"
    Rockity Rock and Stone!
You realize Helldivers 2s insane success shows that DRG made a massive mistake by not doing a realistic art style right? Like, DRG is a great game that Helldivers shamelessly aped, and now DRG is seen as the retarded little brother copying big brother Helldivers.
I like to see this as, just like someone pointed out here, Helldivers fight on top for Super Earth, the Dwarves fight under for Mining Corporate who might supply the Helldivers while the workers from Lethal Company scavage stuffs after the fight.
Deep rock galactic + Helldivers 2= Derockcracy
Is this game like Helldivers?
For Democracy and Stone!!
Helldivers needs a dwarfdiver mode
Crossover event when
would it be better to have hell diver bugs in the caves with the dwarves, the dwarves up on the surface with the divers, or both working together in each game to do tasks that are linked somehow
At this point we need an ester egg in Helldivers where you can see a dwarve pop out of the ground, he throws ( insert hell divers enemy), and drags the run away glyphid back under groumd
ROCK AND STONE
    Rockity Rock and Stone!
Let’s see… Section 8, ODST, Helldivers, and DRG. Could easily be a formidable fighting force since all of them involve orbital drop.
"aye, vermintide 2 is here isn't he"
 side by side with a surface dweller
I think at this point helldivers and deep rock galactic have just turned into one big subreddit
For Rock and Democracy! ⛏️
Imagine this two game having a crossover. Weapon and technology trade even.
"Sweet Liberty, I can't feel my beard. HEEELP!"

(In female Helldiver voice)
Exploited workers both, under the boot of a government or company doesn't matter.
My current fanfic lore is humans are making the dwarves go deep under these planets to mine for critical resources used for spacefaring and the war of managed democracy, humanity IS management guiding them in the resource acquisition and the extermination of bugs  that come from deep in the planet on a multi pronged war both on the surface and deep within. The remnant technologies you see in the mines are early versions of the Automaton and Cyborg technology that was left behind from the previous galactic war.

Stay tuned for episode 2.
I cried a little 🥲
Please crossover 🙏
MORE MEAT FOR THE C4
DRG: we have few workers rights and exploit wildlife for profit we’re so evil 😈

OIL AND STONE, MANAGED DEMOCRACY AND ROCKS!
If a pointy eared leaf lover would also hate bugs and love exterminating them, would he be a friend?
Hox Divers!
"Rock and Liber-tea!"
I’d pay for this cross over
I actually want to try Deep Rock Galactic, so I’m curious is it good and can I play it solo, cuz I have no friends to play games with
    Absolutely, the solo experience is very good (Bless Bosco) and even if you don't have people to play with, online missions are also very good, you won't find many toxic or trolling players, quite the opposite, it is a very welcoming community [quick anecdote here: I was playing a mission and there was an engineer that was messing up, as he was quite new, someone called him out and another person responded with "don't go too hard on him, he is starting" I love this community] hope you play it and like it, and just a heads up, if someone rocks and stones, it is morally mandatory you rock and stone back, couse "if you don't rock and stone, you ain't comin home!"
        Thanks for the help and thank you for sharing such an heartwarming story with me
We die in the dark so they can die in the light.
I would pay top dolar for DRG & HD2 collab

Thank goodness, I thought I was the only one who noticed how similar the games were. It’s like going from TF2 into overwatch
"Rock and Liberty!"
I honestly see no point in buying hell divers if you already play deep rock unless you're bored.
    Three words: Endless orbital artillery
The real reason we don't have those tunneler worms in HD2 currently. Also Areowhead, where pickaxe emote
Don't let them near the Fat Boys
Driller watchin napalm strike and 500kg bomb, that's it I'm leaving the company...
    Until he realizes that his pickaxe does more damage than the 500kg bomb
Helldivers looks great but I can’t play it until they remove that god forsaken anticheat/drm. It doesn’t even stop people from cheating, it just infects your pc with a virus.
Did I hear rock and democracy??
Rock and stone!
    Rock and Stone, Brother!
So who's playing? I wanna buy it but I have questions.

1) How easy is it to play with strangers? Can I join midmission?

2) Is there a lot of cosmetics to unlock? They all look very similar and bland.

3) Is there a difficulty setting? I play on haz 3.
    Yes, its easy to play with strangers without mics, but you will sorely miss the laser pointer / ping communication.

There are not nearly as many as DRG, and yea, they are similar and a bit bland. But DRG cosmetics are off the chart fun. These keep their focus on the genre.

For sure, difficulty from 1 to 10 or so. I find 4 to be rough and 5 to be hard. Still working on it.
I like to think that Deep Rock Galactic is a company that supports the Helldivers and is their biggest client...
I specifically asked someone to make this and now I'm so happy aaaaa
Uh-oh, ⚠️WARNING⚠️ front page of reddit reached. Comence people commenting about how they feel politically about a satirical video game meme 😡
This is cute but they would super hate dwarves lol.
I want HD2 to do a crossover with DRG so bad, give us liber tea at the bar and give the divers more bugs to fight on a new planet.
The only one's I've seen that are even slightly upset about Helldivers is the EDF fan base. "THEY RIPED OFF EDF!" was quite popular for a while.

The DRG fan base is only upset about the lack of a bar.
Lord of the Resources in Middle-Space
Democracy and stone, to the bone!
I've been yelling rock in stone in game all week!
We're all just here to kill bugs
As we are above, so they are below!
Now we need a wing diver or fencer to join in. The very first giant bug exterminators
I keep switching between these games and it's great!
There needs to be a Doom/Animal Crossing style crossover between these two communities.
Rock and stone to my Helldiver brothers! Wish I could spread some god damn democracy but apparently Microsoft doesn’t care about Super Earth!
    Rock and roll and stone!
MANAGED DEMOCRACY, ROCK AND STONE!
    Rock and Stone!
What’s this other game?
    Helldivers 2
they should colab useing small ditals and get other company games in on it
The dwarves are just seasoned helldivers that have been compressed from excessive orbital drops.

Crossover when
~~For Frodo~~

FOR KARL!
Helldivers are just the Dwarves of the surface.
It’d be cool to see a crossover. I’m hearing both games are kickass.
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who wants this to be a cross over.
Does this assume that the hell divers are secretly elves? /j
We need a crossover game that includes deep rock, helldivers, and lethal company. Where the lethal company fails to feed the monster scrap enough, so the company uses a device to call upon the assistance from the helldivers and deeprock. The helldivers help because the threat it poses against super earth and its people. The deeprock helps because the mention of a possible golden planet. So all of them go together and enter the monster to kill it from the inside, and possibly aquire the golden planet
Not until they remove the rootkit and forced always online DRM for a peer to peer game. 

Core game is good, but the corporate decision making gave the game super-cancer, and I try to avoid anti-consumer companies.
I love these crossovers so much
We need guys from EDF5.This will be best trio.
Gimli when fightin side by side with an elf
Let's be real the helldivers/super earth are goofier 40k humans. And we know how 40k humans feel about non-humans.
Absa-fuckin-lutely my head cannon

If a robot can see you, it's a problem. Bugs are not a problem until they are all the way up on you. The shield generator is the real difference here, you can practically infinitely kite bugs. But robots will wear you down and synergize well with each other.

Plus their armored units are more of a problem. Dreadnaughts and walkers are spammable, dangerous, and aggressive. And that's before I even get to rocket and tank accuracy. By god those tanks and turrets have snipers on the helm.

I did a 180. I used to mow down automatons with the grenade launcher. Now that I'm on higher difficulties, I can solo helldive bugs...but robots, robots scare me.

You drive em outa their holes, we got stratagems waiting for em. For FREEDOMNAND MANAGED DEMOCRACY! ROCK AND FUCKING STONE!
"Not to me."
I did that! And then got caught under it's corpse while I was swarmed to death.
    It happens more often than not so no surprise there
    Got pinned in the prone under one, I was safe from bugs, but couldn’t get out until the body despawned. I sat they’re shooting my arc thrower out into the bugs piling over me… making the body pile around me deeper.
        Had a buddy who dived into a dead charger and was stuck so I was asked to shoot him but as soon as I aim and pull the trigger all I hear him say is "Oh I'm free" couldn't help but laugh xD
Yesterday I killed a bile titan by being reinforced onto it. It was awesome!

                Telling someone to not rock and stone is far more 'leaf lover' than rock and stoning a leaf lover.
                    Rock n stone to rock n stone but Don’t rock n stone to bloody leaf loving!
                        I don't think the divers' Idea of democracy is elfish

                Good bots follow orders. It’s been a double-agent this whole time.
                The Helldivers kill bugs and robots, they may not drink, they may stand 7 feet tall, but they ain't no leaf lover. Though they are different from us, we share the same goal.
Tea?! Sounds like leaf lover talk /s
    clearly liber-tea is an alcoholic beverage
        If any tax-man ask, remember, it a tea!
        Liber-tea is a mockery to tea, it's clearly a beer but named tea to insult the British (not democratic). Worthy of rocks and stones
        It probably has gunpowder in it.
    Very true. I’ll be sure to criticize their choice in beverages as we’re stomping bugs.
        A skilled brewer can make tea of the alcoholic variety, so it isn't all bad.
        I mean at least those starship trooper guys drank beer! It wasn't a dwarven beer so it was shit beer, but it was still beer!
            Things can be taught

Let my drill'r introduce the bots to Bertha the Flamethrower.
    If you think the flamethrower is strong you should try impact mixture on the sludge pump. Build for normal shot damage, use the charge shot on groups, and the normal shot on tough or single targets.
        I can highly recommend the chemical war crime gun as well, it's SO GOOD!
No way... We really got the attention of robert

It’s already happening, why do you think Helldivers are only ever above ground?
    Helldivers gets a shot of caves when the bugs cover them up completely and extinguish the generous skies.

For reals, one time I had crawled in a crack and covered in bugs. I said, fuck it, threw a grenade and got ready to drop back XD
        I love dropping a panic orbital on myself when i get swarmed!
Why do you think the unions been various degrees of non functional for several years
    Hey, say what you want, but Dwarves are a hell of a lot less disposable to DRG than Helldivers are to SE (just not less disposable than a clutch of mini-mules).
        dwarfs matter enough for them to leave the pod in what is essentially a pissed off fire ant nest for 5 minutes risking the entire haul so they can be retrieved, if dwarfs and helldivers met theyd be in shock to hear the other sides usual mission
Would Karl and the ‘GUARDDOG’ get along ya think?
    I think the guarddog would help the bartender back in the hub. As for Karl, he would find every mortar left on the field and enjoy a cup of LIBER\_THEA as he watches destruction rain down, before getting up and pissing on their corpses.
It would be liberated so hard...
There could be a whole area on the edge of the map called something like "dwarven territory" or "mining sector" with a bunch of systems under DRG control.

They wouldn't be enemy held territory because DRG could supply Super Earth and DRG already operates on mostly uninhabitable planets, so SE wouldn't really need those systems anyway.

The rivals and glyphids could be a good enemy here too. The rivals being an "automaton force designed specifically for the conquest of that sector" and the glyphids just being glyphids.
Well that's what among us did with other indie games. I guess with enough time and determination it could happen

I'm so down for it tho. I really want to liberate the mines of hoxxes while a team of red suited guys with shovels, jetpacks and boomboxes get dropped into a warzone on their ship.
Is it ever, it's like your friend from work and your childhood friend getting along. Good times are had all around.

Rockity Rock and Stone!
Both I found lmfao, someone even said that they could add Easter eggs into each game and people would go ape shit, like finding a pickaxe and broken down Molly in Helldivers and the like
Dwarfs goal is not to kill bugs but to mine. Bugs just stand in theyr way
Rockity Rock and Stone!
Rockity Rock and Stone!
Absolutely, the solo experience is very good (Bless Bosco) and even if you don't have people to play with, online missions are also very good, you won't find many toxic or trolling players, quite the opposite, it is a very welcoming community [quick anecdote here: I was playing a mission and there was an engineer that was messing up, as he was quite new, someone called him out and another person responded with "don't go too hard on him, he is starting" I love this community] hope you play it and like it, and just a heads up, if someone rocks and stones, it is morally mandatory you rock and stone back, couse "if you don't rock and stone, you ain't comin home!"
    Thanks for the help and thank you for sharing such an heartwarming story with me
Rock and Stone in the Heart!
Three words: Endless orbital artillery
Until he realizes that his pickaxe does more damage than the 500kg bomb
Rock and Stone, Brother!
Yes, its easy to play with strangers without mics, but you will sorely miss the laser pointer / ping communication.

There are not nearly as many as DRG, and yea, they are similar and a bit bland. But DRG cosmetics are off the chart fun. These keep their focus on the genre.

For sure, difficulty from 1 to 10 or so. I find 4 to be rough and 5 to be hard. Still working on it.
Rock and roll and stone!

Mine is that the Helldivers are fighting this war elsewhere in the galaxy and the Dwarves have been employed to mine the minerals at Hoxxes IV needed for the war effort as well as doing field testing for some of their weapons
    I like to imagine that the Dwarves are just so completely drunk that every planet is Hoxxes IV to them, and they're killing the nests completely while the divers take out the entrances so none can escape.
        I like to think the Dwarves are also running all of the tech from the ship, scurrying along the companionways and pushing every big red button that says "boom" they can find
            Y e s

No, please. I can’t. Not again. I can’t go back, I CANNOT GO BAAAACK!      /s
Nothing prepares you for The ‘Creek
    i might be the exception but i would rather fight bots any day than bugs. 

Especially on higher difficulties the bugs are just so aggresive if you arent killing basically everything instantly they will just chase you, slow you and kill you but if you see a bunch of bots you can fall back into cover, call airstrikes without fear a bile titan is going to rush your position and step on you.
        I used to feel this way until I started getting swarmed by rockets and armor.

If a robot can see you, it's a problem. Bugs are not a problem until they are all the way up on you. The shield generator is the real difference here, you can practically infinitely kite bugs. But robots will wear you down and synergize well with each other.

Plus their armored units are more of a problem. Dreadnaughts and walkers are spammable, dangerous, and aggressive. And that's before I even get to rocket and tank accuracy. By god those tanks and turrets have snipers on the helm.

I did a 180. I used to mow down automatons with the grenade launcher. Now that I'm on higher difficulties, I can solo helldive bugs...but robots, robots scare me.
Rock n stone to rock n stone but Don’t rock n stone to bloody leaf loving!
    I don't think the divers' Idea of democracy is elfish
    I mean he has a point but ppl still hate him
