[[The scanner just lit up like a christmas tree! I'm sure it did]]





mission control has a send swarm button because if they don't do it often it builds up and you end up with an unstoppable megaswarm that just comes out automatically

source: my buddy saw it in a dream once
    That… that‘s an awesome idea. Just imagine a swarm that takes 10-15 minutes, with gigantic hoardes of weaker enemies. 
Probably won’t happen, because of performance issues (the devs warned lower end PC users from using the new more enemies modifier in Haz 5+) but the idea is incredible.

Have it as a chance to happen in a mission, very very unlikely, but when it happens, you have 10-15 minutes without anything bothering you, not even a single swarmer, and THEN shit hits the fan.
        When running Swarm Control mods I like to do stuff like this. Long period of quiet, empty caves (reduce spawns on generation to very low) then just fucking generate a x8 horde of mobs (lower hp, slow movement) that flood the goddamn walls - oh and like 4 detonators of course
            That sounds like it looks really cool
    Megaswarm sounds fun
Looks boring, slam that swarm button control.
Thats some advanced conspiracy theory you got here
Dude is on a different level of conspiracy theories
Smartest scout main:
    you think me to be the prey, when i am in fact the predator (driller)
Let's just say, if you get a perpetual aquarq mission, you know why.

That's how Karl died
The button is, of course, big, red, and illuminated, labelled 'SEND SWARM' in white caps.
How do they even know what christmas is
