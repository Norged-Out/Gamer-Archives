[[Orisa is so annoying, the devs need to do something about her.]]


I propose they buff every other Tank to her level.

We’re not going back to 6V6 for whatever reason. It could be stubbornness, incompetence, the game not being able to handle it in the first place, whatever. Tank players are stuck in this shit hole, so we might as well accommodate them.

tanks are the biggest targets, front-lining for their team and sometime back-lining on the enemy’s side. They are the easiest to hit, and since they have to make space, they often cannot retreat without losing a lot of ground.

Orisa can just sit there, shoot and cycle abilities and will only die if the enemy team wises up and kills her Supports, or the Orisa player gets dove by Winston IRL. But as a Solo Tank, being a wall is the best thing that could happen, other than getting a Tanky friend to help out.

For starters, ALL Debuffs should be reduced by 50% on Tanks. Orb of Discord should be 12.5% damage vulnerability. Biotic Grenade should reduce healing by 50%. Stuns last half their normal duration. All the bells and whistles. They’re the biggest target, therefore the easiest to hit, therefore the easiest to fuck over by ‘SkILlFUlLy’ lobbing whatever CC Hell you have in their general direction.

Next, all Tanks should be able to keep their niches, but have some sort of protection against their weaknesses. D.Va being beamed down is unacceptable, since they don’t have a fellow Tank to back them up and they can’t rely on their Supports and especially not their DPS or bail them out.

D.Va, Sigma and Orisa should be able to reduce beam damage by 50% with their projectile deletion abilities.

Reinhardt should be able to move at normal walking speed with his hammer. Maybe even let him clumsily swing his hammer with one arm, even if he swings slower whilst holding his shield.

Mauga should have tighter spread, preferably none, so he doesn’t have to gun down the enemy Tank constantly or deal chip damage to squishies from range.

Basically anything that you can think of that would be perceived as overpowered or stupid, SHOULD be added to the game because having a Solo Tank inherently makes them underpowered simply by existing.

Now, I know what you’re all thinking, ‘this is extremely stupid, it takes away from the Tank’s design by getting rid of their counter-play simply by buffing by their numbers to ludicrous levels.’ 

I agree, this IS all stupid, but it’s mandatory if we keep 5V5 around. Either the servers are upgraded to handle 6V6 again, or we’ll all be stuck either dealing with OP Tanks, or Tanks constantly getting screwed, causing Tank Players to leave and further worsening queue times.

I hope these dumbass balance changes I proposed will show some people how stupid 5V5 is.


I read the whole post
>will only die if the enemy team wises up and kills her Supports

You literally said this and carried on saying she's invincible. I bet you sit there in your silver lobbies seething and saying "ba ba ba no one killing supports ba ba ba", and then also don't kill supports
[deleted]
    Good for you. People often play her as a crutch, especially if losing, so they probably weren’t all that good to begin with.

Plus it’s not like you fight her, you just go around her and fight her team, something most Tanks can’t really do as easily.

            He means like in a standup fight. As ball you just hit and run and target the backline. Orissa eats Hamster, so if you’re wasting time peeling dmg from the tank instead of focusing squishes in the back or making space for you team then you’re playing him wrong.

>I propose they buff every other Tank to her level.

I can already tell this is not worth reading through just because of this sentence.

Orisa is only as powerful as she is because she gets some minor buffs from time to time and the fact that she has 3 abilities that reduce or negate damage.
    Read the whole post, you’ll see my point.
        All i need is the last 3 paragraphs. "Buff all tanks, put overpowered abilities into the game, and give more copium to tank players who think they are better than they actually are because they are overpowered." Paraphrased slightly, but that's pretty much what you are saying.
            So you also saw how I said that those balance changes would all be stupid and unfun for all non-Tank players if they were added, but Tanks would continue to be unfun and queue times would remain awful without them.
                In the last 3 paragraphs, you said nothing about non tank players having a very horrible experience, but im pretty sure it would be implied with tanks becoming actual tanks against foot soldiers.

You also said that these changes are "mandatory" if (and we will) stay in 5v5. So pick a side. Either this post is you chatting shit off a loss streak, or you have cleared your head and thought through what you said.
                    I said that these type of changes would be necessary to make Tanksmore enjoyable, but that would sacrifice the enjoyment of the other Roles.

If these changes aren’t implemented, Tanks will remain unfun and easily counterable, which will worsen queue times for the other Roles anyway.

The proper solution is to go back to 6V6 and make individual Tanks just as strong as individuals from other Roles, but having 2 of them they can each take damage, so instead of having to 1V5 the enemy team’s damage, you can each 1V3.
                        >make individual Tanks just as strong as individuals from other Roles, 

There are 2 flaws with this. 1, you can not buff every tank to make them able to 1v5 and put 2 tanks on the team. Otherwise, there will be an insane shift in power in every team fight. 2, characters on other roles are made to have their specialty, lifeweaver helps escape, ana to make them disengage, soldier to flank the supports and poke from afar, hanzo to get information and get quick burst kills. (With aggressive playstyle) the list goes on.

If tank is able to overwhelmingly win a team fight, because they are even somewhat decent, that is an example of poor balance and character design. And im not even hoing to go into having 2 of these tanks and being able to synergize with each other, basically making it a 2v2 against the tank line.
                            That’s not at all my point. Either Tanks should be able to Solo in 5V5, since they’re the main target and take the most punishment, it’s only fair they can fish it back.

Or in 6V6 Tanks are nerfed to be on par with any other Hero from any other Role, but there’s now 2 of them and they can synergise, like how you can have a Brigitte protect your Zenyatta, you can have a Zarya protect a charging. Reinhardt.

Right now in 5V5, Tanks are stronger than another Hero from any other Role, but they aren’t nearly strong enough to Tank a 1V5 worth of enemy CC, debuffs and damage, so all they can do is cycle through Orisa’s 3 defensive abilities and pray they don’t get mauled.
                                >Tanks should be able to Solo in 5V5,

No, they should not. They should be able to win, depending on the situation, in a 3v5, but they should not be able to 1v5. This is a team shooter at the end of the day. Tanks should be punished for bad positioning, and they should be killed when 4 out of the 5 opponents are shooting at them.

>it’s only fair they can fish it back.

I would only agree with this if its almost guaranteed that the target they dive will die.

> on par with any other Hero from any other Role

I do not understand how they are "on par". Every character is different. Every character has their own strengths and weaknesses. Every character has their own responsibility in a fight. I do noy understand what you mean by "on par with any other hero from any other role"

>We’re not going back to 6V6 for whatever reason. It could be stubbornness, incompetence, the game not being able to handle it in the first place, whatever.

Did we just forget how bad queue times were in OW1? Unless you can magically induce an influx of tank players, that problem's not going away. Meaning 6v6 is not going to happen.

>Next, all Tanks should be able to keep their niches, but have some sort of protection against their weaknesses.

Heroes in a MOBA have strengths and weakness? Who'd have thought?
    Queue times were bad because the Tank and Support Roles were bad. People only wanted to play DPS. They should’ve been given an incentive to play other Roles, preferably by making those other Roles better instead of a whole 25 coins. Wow, I can now buy 1/40 or a single old Legendary skin! How generous of you!

Yes, Heroes should have weaknesses (except for Kiriko for some reason), but the Tank’s weaknesses are too easily exploitable because they are one massive target, in the middle of a team fight, and any number of enemies can just switch to their counter and make them unplayable, and if their team doesn’t do the same to the enemy Tank, it’s game over.

Either they make Solo Tanks immune to basically everything, the shit and lazy answer, or they find a way to make their gameplay less ‘try not to get fistfucked by 9 players at once’ simulator.
        Don't forget they abandoned the game to work on ow2 😜
    Queue times were bad in OW1 because there were so few tanks to choose from. There were 8 tanks by the end of OW1 and there are 12 today. 

6v6 is going to happen just like Wow Classic happened. It's only a matter of time.
        I highly doubt 8 vs 12 tanks was the reason so few players wanted to play tank. Remember that tank queue times were instant while DPS/Support were >10 minutes. An addition of 4 tanks is not going to move that by much.
            >I highly doubt 8 vs 12 tanks was the reason so few players wanted to play tank. 

Variety is the spice of life. Similarly, few players were playing support in OW1 and there was a similarly small pool of heroes to choose.
                I see our disagreement. I don't doubt at all that variety would bring some players into the tank role. But variety was far from being a prominent or main reason that players didn't want to play tank in OW1. So I don't think variety alone will be enough to salvage the queue time problem that existed.
                    > But variety was far from being a prominent or main reason that players didn't want to play tank in OW1

There were only 8 tanks and if you didn't pick first, there were only 7 tanks. It was a massive reason why people didn't want to play tank. Same goes for support.
                        It seems we are running into a wall. Hypothetically, what new information would convince you that variety was not the main reason players didn't want to play tank in OW1?

Personally, I think it was just balance. Most players that played tank were not main tank players and if you ended up with no main tanks against a team that had one or more, that was going to be a loss more often than not. 

Tank duos are just not practical to balance around, leading to players not wanting to play tank.
                            It's obvious that hero pool size was an issue. That's why they focused on tanks and supports being added much more than dps.


>Tank duos are just not practical to balance around, leading to players not wanting to play tank.



Bullshit. 6v6 is straight up a more fun experience, as tank, than 5v5.
                                >It's obvious that hero pool size was an issue. That's why they focused on tanks and supports being added much more than dps.

You're thinking about it backwards. They added more tanks and supports because their pools were smaller, yes, but it wasn't as big of an issue like you're saying. 

>Bullshit. 6v6 is straight up a more fun experience, as tank, than 5v5.

If you want to say that, you can. That's not changing the fact that there was a severe lack of tank players in OW1. 

If you want to make the argument going from 5v5 to 6v6 will bring in more tank players, I can grant you that. However, going from 5v5 to 6v6 means that instead of 20% of players needing to be tank without affecting queue times, it'll be 33%. Do you seriously think 1/3 of players will want to play tank?
                                    >You're thinking about it backwards. They added more tanks and supports because their pools were smaller, yes, but it wasn't as big of an issue like you're saying.

Why wouldn’t a simpler solution be to nerf Orissa? Why bring everything up to her level when she’s the one with the problem?

Obvs buffing the other tanks like you describe would make them so powerful that they’d likely roll over dps and support classes as a whole.

Totally agree on Orissa being imba though. Easy af to play with insane dmg, cc, and survivability.
    Nerfing Orisa causes another Tank to take her place as the META slave. Tanks already suffer as is, so nerfing all Tanks to be as ~~good~~ God awful as say Reinhardt, would kill the Role entirely.

But my point was that buffing all Tanks to be immovable walls is also a bad idea since it ruins the other Roles.

The only way to fix 5V5, is to throw it in a dumpster and instead split the power of the Solo Tank 50/50 between two Tanks, so they can synergise to cover each other’s weaknesses, instead of making one Tank immune to everything.
No. Just no. Just kill supports when its any tank basicaly. The tanks aren't that bad rn you just need to get good. D.va for example can use mobility to escape beams easily (and well if they are all beam characters why pick d.va) and sigma has shields. I can get the cc argument but thats too extreme of a buff. Tanks aren't meant to be op they are still just people (or robots). The thing is tanks are good its just that playing tanks is hard and you need a lot of game knowledge and awareness for it to work well. I get what you're putting down but just working on your individual skill is the best you can do as the game is fairly balanced as of right now.
Funny how these kind of posts are always massively downvotted when so much people are vocal about not liking Orisa as a character.

Conclusion : the average redditor is an Orisa main
😂 orisa is ez get gud
Eh, just pick a zen. Cause these suggestions sound kinda poop lol
    That’s exactly my point. If we keep 5V5 we either add these awful changes, or keep an entire Role in purgatory.

I do not understand how they are "on par". Every character is different. Every character has their own strengths and weaknesses. Every character has their own responsibility in a fight. I do noy understand what you mean by "on par with any other hero from any other role"
Don't forget they abandoned the game to work on ow2 😜
I highly doubt 8 vs 12 tanks was the reason so few players wanted to play tank. Remember that tank queue times were instant while DPS/Support were >10 minutes. An addition of 4 tanks is not going to move that by much.
    >I highly doubt 8 vs 12 tanks was the reason so few players wanted to play tank. 

Variety is the spice of life. Similarly, few players were playing support in OW1 and there was a similarly small pool of heroes to choose.
        I see our disagreement. I don't doubt at all that variety would bring some players into the tank role. But variety was far from being a prominent or main reason that players didn't want to play tank in OW1. So I don't think variety alone will be enough to salvage the queue time problem that existed.
            > But variety was far from being a prominent or main reason that players didn't want to play tank in OW1

There were only 8 tanks and if you didn't pick first, there were only 7 tanks. It was a massive reason why people didn't want to play tank. Same goes for support.
                It seems we are running into a wall. Hypothetically, what new information would convince you that variety was not the main reason players didn't want to play tank in OW1?

Personally, I think it was just balance. Most players that played tank were not main tank players and if you ended up with no main tanks against a team that had one or more, that was going to be a loss more often than not. 

Tank duos are just not practical to balance around, leading to players not wanting to play tank.
                    It's obvious that hero pool size was an issue. That's why they focused on tanks and supports being added much more than dps.


>Tank duos are just not practical to balance around, leading to players not wanting to play tank.



Bullshit. 6v6 is straight up a more fun experience, as tank, than 5v5.
                        >It's obvious that hero pool size was an issue. That's why they focused on tanks and supports being added much more than dps.

You're thinking about it backwards. They added more tanks and supports because their pools were smaller, yes, but it wasn't as big of an issue like you're saying. 

>Bullshit. 6v6 is straight up a more fun experience, as tank, than 5v5.

If you want to say that, you can. That's not changing the fact that there was a severe lack of tank players in OW1. 

If you want to make the argument going from 5v5 to 6v6 will bring in more tank players, I can grant you that. However, going from 5v5 to 6v6 means that instead of 20% of players needing to be tank without affecting queue times, it'll be 33%. Do you seriously think 1/3 of players will want to play tank?

8 heroes split between 2 people. We already discussed this.

He means like in a standup fight. As ball you just hit and run and target the backline. Orissa eats Hamster, so if you’re wasting time peeling dmg from the tank instead of focusing squishes in the back or making space for you team then you’re playing him wrong.
You only think my take is shit because you couldn’t be bothered to read the whole post.

Read the post, then you may have an opinion.
    Read it, L take, malding, tilted, etc.
        Elaborate.
            He can’t. Orisa is objectively the best
So you also saw how I said that those balance changes would all be stupid and unfun for all non-Tank players if they were added, but Tanks would continue to be unfun and queue times would remain awful without them.
    In the last 3 paragraphs, you said nothing about non tank players having a very horrible experience, but im pretty sure it would be implied with tanks becoming actual tanks against foot soldiers.

You also said that these changes are "mandatory" if (and we will) stay in 5v5. So pick a side. Either this post is you chatting shit off a loss streak, or you have cleared your head and thought through what you said.
        I said that these type of changes would be necessary to make Tanksmore enjoyable, but that would sacrifice the enjoyment of the other Roles.

If these changes aren’t implemented, Tanks will remain unfun and easily counterable, which will worsen queue times for the other Roles anyway.

The proper solution is to go back to 6V6 and make individual Tanks just as strong as individuals from other Roles, but having 2 of them they can each take damage, so instead of having to 1V5 the enemy team’s damage, you can each 1V3.
            >make individual Tanks just as strong as individuals from other Roles, 

There are 2 flaws with this. 1, you can not buff every tank to make them able to 1v5 and put 2 tanks on the team. Otherwise, there will be an insane shift in power in every team fight. 2, characters on other roles are made to have their specialty, lifeweaver helps escape, ana to make them disengage, soldier to flank the supports and poke from afar, hanzo to get information and get quick burst kills. (With aggressive playstyle) the list goes on.

If tank is able to overwhelmingly win a team fight, because they are even somewhat decent, that is an example of poor balance and character design. And im not even hoing to go into having 2 of these tanks and being able to synergize with each other, basically making it a 2v2 against the tank line.
                That’s not at all my point. Either Tanks should be able to Solo in 5V5, since they’re the main target and take the most punishment, it’s only fair they can fish it back.

Or in 6V6 Tanks are nerfed to be on par with any other Hero from any other Role, but there’s now 2 of them and they can synergise, like how you can have a Brigitte protect your Zenyatta, you can have a Zarya protect a charging. Reinhardt.

Right now in 5V5, Tanks are stronger than another Hero from any other Role, but they aren’t nearly strong enough to Tank a 1V5 worth of enemy CC, debuffs and damage, so all they can do is cycle through Orisa’s 3 defensive abilities and pray they don’t get mauled.
                    >Tanks should be able to Solo in 5V5,

No, they should not. They should be able to win, depending on the situation, in a 3v5, but they should not be able to 1v5. This is a team shooter at the end of the day. Tanks should be punished for bad positioning, and they should be killed when 4 out of the 5 opponents are shooting at them.
