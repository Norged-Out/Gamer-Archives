[[My strongest controversial opinions about Overwatch]]


* **Pharah and Mauga are the worst designed characters by far**

An amazing amount of thought was put into the gameplay of Overwatch characters. Venture, the new hero, has a very smooth and fun kit IMO, while not being oppressive to play against. Pharah and Mauga are an exception

**Pharah**: A permanently flying character has no place in a game where there is a man swinging only a hammer. What makes it worse is that, unlike echo, she's incentivised to stay far away in the sky, spamming away.

What's worse is that her ultimate can only be described as "dumb". While other ults in the game are carefully designed so that they have high potential for value, but it's not guaranteed e.g. dragonblade requiring tons of skill, dva bomb having a delayed explosion (*hint hint),* Pharah is able to unload 15 whatthefuck-illion damage instantly. Strayed a bit too close as wrecking ball? bummer. What's more, is that it's shitty for Pharah, too. Barrage is the only ultimate other than terra surge that locks the player in place--and Orisa has loads of HP + fortify to compensate, too.

**Mauga**: Mauga basically has permanent uptime on everything. Although his cardiac overdrive is on a cooldown, he has shield regen in the meantime and a hefty magazine. This is necessary, because Mauga's massive square hitbox has permanent uptime, too, and he has barely any damage mitigation abilities. This makes Mauga a nightmare to balance, and unfun to play against, as there's really not much outplay potential.

Mauga is also similar to Pharah, in having a completely stupid ult. While grav has a tiny radius and can be eaten, deflected, or ignored with a support ability, Mauga's ultimate is an INSTANT, UNAVOIDABLE, LARGE AOE, 8 SECOND HARD CC, complete with a hinder. This practically goes against every ultimate ability design principle in the game

* **New sombra has never been more fair and balanced to play against as a tank**

I've played wrecking ball since overwatch 1, and have been from gold to masters. New sombra is extremely forgiving on tanks now, and I rarely find myself really struggling against them.

Her virus makes it so that she is heavily incentivised to target squishes instead of her tank, and the high mobility tanks that she counters can chase her new translocator down much more easily. Hack's short ability lockout makes it dangerous but not oppressive. I think the dev team has cooked with these changes, especially regarding her interaction with tanks.

* **Orisa isn't that oppressive**

I've personally never felt that orisa was oppressive, while playing rein, doomfist, or ball. I'm not sure why my experience is so different from others' but I'll try to summarize the reasons.

* tank interactions, when greatly greatly simplified, boil down to this: When one tank goes into the enemy's backline, the enemy tank has two options: either go into the other team's backline, or peel for their own backline. Orisa is not the best at either. She doesn't have the best mobility to get close into the enemy backline, or safely get out, while she only has a spear to stun the enemy tank for a fraction of a second.
* As such, all of Orisa's power comes from directly fighting the enemy tank, which is often what happens. I think this is the mental loop that prevents tanks from realizing this: *A tank goes to fight orisa, but find out that she is unkillable with supports, and they die -> the last thing they see before they die is the horse shooting into them -> they believe that the horse is the issue, and resolve to kill them even more, unknowingly just playing into their trap.* However, I think people have to realize that, if the orisa is going to be alive forever, they're going to be constantly shooting and spearing you no matter if you try to kill her or not. For the enemy squishies, however, it's a different story.
* Another mental block I think people find with orisa, is that she has an answer to everything. She can spear divers, spin on projectiles and bullets, while fortifying to endlessly soak damage. When one tries to dive and gets speared, for example, they think *"damn, guess I can't do that because that ability exists"* while not realizing that NOW THEY CAN dive, because that ability is on cooldown. Orisa has an answer to everything, but not at all times.

* **Idea for kiriko suzu change: Suzu poison**

I find it kind of bullshit that suzu can soak a trillion damage, but if it's going to stay that way, I have an idea: **what if, after suzu lands, players in the suzu take a portion of the damage they were supposed to receive as damage over time?** That way, suzu would be trading momentary pressure for long-term pressure, as opposed to just being a mass break-out-of-jail card for your entire team.

|

* **Idea for Mercy resurrect change: instant resurrect**

I think that mercy gameplay gets a bit boring. The fun part is avoiding enemies using movement, but at higher levels it becomes better to just pocket a DPS while hiding behind a wall. Additionally, Hail Mary Mercy rezzes at lower ranks feel kind of BS, and lucky at times.

My idea is for mercy's resurrect to INSTANTLY resurrect ONE PERSON within a small radius and within line of sight, limited to just a second after they die. This would force mercy to get out behind the telephone box or whatever she's playing behind, and put herself closer to the team, and at more risk, for the tradeoff of a much safer and less luck-based resurrect. Mercy movement would become much more needed again, and rezzes would feel more earned. This might sound totally bonkers to avid mercy players though, as I haven't played the character too much.

Thoughts on any of my opinions? Are the completely stupid? Do they make a bit of sense?


I ain't reading all that lol
    From what little I've read, in summary OP basically has a massive skill issue. So much so that he calls Pharah's ult busted. Despite it literally rotting her in place, making her easier to kill. Not to mention all the abilities that negate, stun, or absorb Rocket Barrage.

Yeah OP gotta be banned from all kitchens in the world for this one.
        Well I can already see that you've read very little, I'm saying the ult is basically all-or-nothing.

It unloads 2 billion dps instantly, so if you don't have a defense you're fucked

If you do have a defense, then the pharah is fucked because she's locked in place

All around it's just dumb
            No it doesn't deal that damage instantly?

Maybe for your slow ass, but I consistently can just use my movement ability to escape it, so does everyone else. And those that can't duck behind cover usually have abilities that negate the ultimate like Sigma's Grasp or just cancel the ability through a stun such as Ana's Sleep Dart.

Just because you are so slow that you can't dodge an easily telegraphed ultimate that takes time to kill you, doesn't mean vast majority can't.
                Well, do you think it would be better if it were kept the same way, or not? If not, we’re on the same side.
                    It's fine as it is.
                        Really? because everything you've outlined makes it seem like hot doo-doo.

edit: not "seems" like shit, it is shit
Holy fuck. This is more writing then my school essays
    idk it must be lenient b/c this took me like 8 minutes to write
When was the last time you've played this game? 2018? I haven't heard Pharah finish her ultimate line for a couple of years now, this ultimate hardly ever brings any value, and if it does she usually solo ults someone.
    Nowhere did I mention pharah ult is busted, more than the fact that it's just a dumb all-or-nothing gamble. Her never finishing the ult is mentioned as one of my main issues with it, as well as how it's a guaranteed instakill on some characters.
I don't get what point you're trying to make with any of this. You're all over the place.

1. You complain that Pharah's ult is too strong ("15 whatthefuck-illion damage instantly") but also complain that it's too weak because she gets locked in place and doesn't have Fortify like Orisa. So is it too strong or too weak?

2. You then complain that Mauga has infinite uptime on everything, and then mention how his cardiac overdrive has a cooldown. In the very next sentence.

3. You complain that Mauga has infinite uptime on everything, as if that means he's strong, then you complain about his enormous hitbox and "barely any damage mitigation", as if that means he's weak. So is he too strong or too weak?

4. Something about how suzu is too strong and should be nerfed by making Kiriko the only support in the game who damages their team. Idk I wasn't really paying attention during this part.

5. You want to bring back old Mercy group rez but as a normal ability and not an ult.
    Not trying to make a specific point

1. This is all to say that pharah's ult is not busted, but is rather a dumb all-or-nothing ability that just seems poorly thought out. On one hand, it's a guaranteed instakill on defenseless characters. On the other, it's a suicide button on an otherwise highly mobile character.
2. I'm mainly referring to his shield generation generating tons of shields and being there. To make him remotely playable against his counters, he had to be made strong against everything. Simply put, if his uptime were only his 4 second cardiac overdrive, then he would be a lot worse than he is right now.
3. Please note that I'm not saying anything is too strong or too weak. Rather, I'm complaining about fundamental concepts in these character's designs. I'm saying he's flawed, as there isn't much outplay potential against him besides chaining cooldowns, and there isn't many "huge plays" he can do besides maybe landing a big stomp and mowing people down.
4. Just a concept, but yes. She would need to be buffed in other areas to compensate.
5. Yeah but for individual players. This one is iffy because I don't know much about the character
Git gud
Sounds like you’re a venture main that’s tired of your overtuned rampage getting shut down by pharah and mauga lol
    I'm actually a hitscan and ball main who rarely finds issue going against these characters.
Your right Pharah Ult does need to be changed because it so bad not because its good. Not sure how suzu can soak that much damage when it lasts .65 seconds. Instant res change will probs be too good.
1.) Pharah has never been a well fitted hero for the cast, even since OW1, but she isn't poorly designed hero, maps themselves rarely assist her gameplay and a lot of times hinder her.

2.) Mauga is a OW1 tank and you can't tell me otherwise. He was not designed for 5v5, and I believe he would've fixed the double shield meta.

3.) Sombra isn't balanced to fight her equally at each role and I don't think she every will be. Someone, tank or support, will always be at a massive disadvantage against a kit that has invisibility, unless she is completely neutered.

4.) Orisa IS oppressive when she is good because she barely has downtime on Cooldowns. Her entire idea is that she will be the last alive or the first dead, no in-between. She's been poorly designed since OW1.

5.) Suzu has always done too much, but adding a DoT mechanic to it just overcomplicates gameplay as her and against her.

6.) Mercy did have instant resurrection before and it sucked. Nobody except for Mercy mains like Moth metas, they just increased everyone's TTK, if you add a guaranteed resurrection to every fight it would be so annoying to go through... Again.
    1) the ult was the main thing I was thinking of when talking about "poorly designed"

2) I think that's pretty fair, He seems like he would really benefit from a sigma shielding him or just anyone else to help soak damage.

3) I don't necessarily agree, as any fast character can "go invisible" by diving from an unseen spot. 

4) However, she has large downtime on peeling for her team or diving your team, which is her main weakness imo.

5) I do agree it would be weird to damage your own team, but I can't think of a better tradeoff that it can have other than just gutting the ability.

6)I think I poorlyphrased it, the resurrection is for one person only. And the radius would be very close, forcing mercy to be near people on the team that could potentially die. For example, while rezzing the tank would significantly turn the fight, constantly staying near them to anticipate the rez would be very risky--it's a tradeoff.
>**Pharah**: A permanently flying character has no place in a game where there is a man swinging only a hammer. What makes it worse is that, unlike echo, she's incentivised to stay far away in the sky, spamming away.

Reworked Pharah plays more like Genji -- her preferred position is now about 4m above the target's head.
