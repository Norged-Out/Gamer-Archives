'''''For Honor''''' is an [[action game]] developed and published by [[Ubisoft]]. The game allows players to play the roles of historical forms of soldiers and warriors such as [[knight]]s, [[samurai]], and [[vikings]], controlled using a [[third-person perspective]]. The game was developed primarily by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and released worldwide for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Windows]], and [[Xbox One]] in 2017.
''For Honor'' received generally favorable reviews, with the difficult and original combat mechanics being highlighted.
==Gameplay==
[[File:For Honor gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|A gameplay screenshot of the game showing three players fighting]]
''For Honor'' is an [[action game]] set during a [[Middle Ages|medieval]], fantasy setting. Players can play as a character from one of the five different factions, namely the Iron Legion (Knights), the Warborn (Vikings), the Dawn Empire (Samurai), and the Wu Lin (Ancient Chinese; introduced in October 2018 with the ''Marching Fire'' expansion), in addition to the uniquely-themed Outlander faction (introduced in January 2022). Playable characters, referred to as "Heroes", are divided into four classes. The Vanguard class is described as "well-balanced" and has excellent offense and defense. The Assassin class is fast and efficient in dueling enemies, but the class deals much less damage to multiple enemies. The Heavies, also known as Tanks, are more resistant to damage and are suitable for holding capture points, though their attacks are slow. The last class, known as "Hybrid", is a combination of two of the three aforementioned types, and is capable of using uncommon skills.
All heroes are unique and have their own weapons, skills, and fighting styles. Players fight against their opponents with their class-specific melee weapons. When players perform certain actions, such as killing multiple enemies consecutively, they gain Feats, which are additional perks. These perks allow players to gain additional points and strengths, call in a barrage of arrows or a catapult attack, or heal themselves. In most missions, players are accompanied by numerous [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] minions. They are significantly weaker than the player character, and do not pose much threat.
A tactical combat system, known as "Art of Battle", is initiated when the player encounters other players or player-like AI in the multiplayer or higher [[Health (gaming)|health]] AI in the campaign. Players enter a dueling mode with them wherein players aim at their opponent with their weapon. Players then can choose how to place and position their weapons from three directions (from above, the right, and the left) when they are attacking their enemies. By observing on-screen hints and the movements of their opponents, which reflect their respective attack position, players are able to choose the correct position to block the other players' attacks. Players also have other special abilities, which vary depending on the character they choose, such as [[barge|barging]] into enemies with their own shoulders and performing back-stepping swipes. The strength of each attack can also be decided by players. The system aims at allowing players to "feel the weight of the weapon in [their] hand".
===Multiplayer===
Similar to the single-player campaign, the multiplayer modes feature perks, AI minions, and the Art of Battle system. As the competitive multiplayer modes feature a structure similar to that of [[shooter game|shooters]], the creative director of the game called ''For Honor'' a "shooter with swords". The multiplayer aspect also allows players to customize their characters. For instance, the armor that the characters wear can be changed and modified. There are seven game modes:
* Dominion: Dominion is a four-versus-four multiplayer mode in which players must capture and hold multiple zones in a battlefield. Points are earned through occupying the zones and killing enemy minions that fight at point B. Players earn double points for staying on points A and C. Once either team earns 1000 points, the other team starts to ‘break’, meaning all players on that team cannot respawn unless revived by a teammate. Afterwards, the team must eliminate all breaking opponents to secure victory.
* Brawl: In this two-versus-two multiplayer mode, one team of two must eliminate the other team completely, best out of 5 games in order to win.
* Duel: Duel is a one-versus-one multiplayer mode in which a player must win the best out of 5 games in order to win.
*Ranked Duel: Ranked duel is a one-versus-one multiplayer mode in which players start in a qualifying stage, where they will have to complete 8 matches before they are placed into one of five rank tiers, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. Players placement depends on how many wins or losses they receive in the 8 qualifying matches. After players are placed within their respective rank tier, players will be pitted against other players within a similar rank tier.
* Skirmish: Skirmish is a four-versus-four multiplayer mode in which players gain points while killing enemies. Once either team earns enough points, they must eliminate the players from the other team and win the match.
* Elimination: A team of players must eliminate the entire opposing team in this four-versus-four multiplayer mode. The team that still has remaining warriors will automatically win the match.
* Tribute: A four-versus-four multiplayer mode where teams attempt to gather offerings and place them on their shrine. Each of the three offering gives the team a special power-up. The first team to capture all three offerings and defend them until the timer ends wins or the team with the most offerings at the end of the battle timer wins.
* Breach: A four-versus-four multiplayer mode where the attacker's goal is to kill the Commander while the defenders must successfully stop the attackers. The attackers must complete a series of objectives such as leading the battering ram to each of the two gates, breaking them both down and, ultimately, slaying the Commander; on the contrary, the defenders must prevent the attackers from completing all these objectives.
===The Faction War===
Each online multiplayer match awards War Assets based on the outcome and the player's performance. These War Assets are then deployed in the Faction War – which stretches across all platforms – where they are used either to defend an allied territory or conquer a neighbouring one occupied by an enemy faction, with the most war assets deployed in a given territory determining the victor. Territories controlled are updated every six hours, while each round lasts for two weeks and each season lasts for ten weeks (five rounds). As the war progresses and territories change, the changing front will determine which maps that are played and their appearance (each map has variants depending on whether it is under Knight, Viking or Samurai control). Players who have distinguished themselves and helped their faction gain and defend ground earn higher quality equipment as spoils of war after each round and each season. After a season ends, the map is reset and a new season begins after an off-season period, but the outcome of the previous season impacts the story background of the new season.
=== Heroes ===
There are currently five factions in ''For Honor''. The first three factions were introduced at game launch: Knights, Vikings, and Samurai. A Chinese-inspired fourth faction, the Wu Lin, was added with the ''Marching Fire'' expansion. The fifth faction, called The Outlanders, are a group of uniquely-themed warriors introduced in Y5S4 who have no cultural links to other factions, let alone each other. There are currently 9 heroes in the Knight faction, 8 in the Viking faction, 8 in the Samurai faction, 5 in the Wu Lin faction, and 4 in The Outlanders faction, making for a grand total of 34 playable heroes. Each hero has their own unique weapons and fighting styles.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
After a natural catastrophe pitted the most fearsome warriors against one another in a fight for resources and territory, the bloodthirsty warlord Apollyon believes the people of the Knights, Vikings, and Samurai have grown weak and wants to create an age of all-out war through manipulation of each faction. To this end the perspectives of characters within each faction are shown as events unfold, battles are waged, and agendas are created as Apollyon works to ensure continuous sparks of conflict between the Legion, the Warborn, and the Chosen from the Myre. With a later DLC, the Wu-Lin, based on Chinese culture, were added, while in-game lore links the Romans fighting for the Legion to a fifth Roman-based faction not present in the game.
===Plot===
The warmonger Apollyon takes control of the knights of the Blackstone Legion after murdering her rivals, who fight for the people of the land of Ashfeld, allowing her to sow the seeds of perpetual war and create stronger men to rule over the weak. During the Blackstone Legion's attempt to bring a dishonorable lord-turned-mercenary, Hervis Daubeny, to justice, his second-in-command, known as the Warden, helps to stop the Blackstone siege and battles the champion of the Blackstone knights. Upon defeating a Blackstone Legion captain, Ademar, the Warden is made a knight of the Legion by Holden Cross, Apollyon's lieutenant, and leaves with him. During his/her time in Apollyon's army, the Warden helps to defend against the Viking raiders of the Warborn, but soon realizes shortly after meeting with Apollyon that she cares nothing about protecting people and seeks to manipulate her enemies into endless battles. Starting with the Vikings, Apollyon and her warriors including Holden Cross, the Warden and fellow lieutenants Stone and Mercy, attack their settlements and sack their strongholds in the northern land of Valkenheim, leaving only enough food and supplies to fight over, and sparing those who would eagerly fight for those scraps or are strong enough to do so.
Afterwards, in Valkenheim, the Viking clans fight among themselves, killing one another for the dwindling scraps left by Apollyon. This continues until a powerful warrior known as Raider comes down from the mountains, and begins uniting the warriors of the various clans under the Warborn banner, alongside Warlord friend Stigandr, Valkyrie warrior Runa and Berserker Helvar, first by killing the brutal raider Ragnar, who steals what little remains from those who cannot feed themselves, and then Siv the Ruthless, who seeks to conquer and plunder their own people. After killing their rivals, Raider's rapidly growing army retake a Warborn stronghold from knights of Apollyon's army, and then set out to the land of the Myre to raid the Dawn Empire of the Chosen, a group of powerful Samurai, to resupply and feed their people. The Raider then leads the assault on the Samurai, kills the Samurai General, Tozen, and causes the Samurai to retreat back to their greatest city. In the chaos, Apollyon kills the Dawn Empire's ruler and his ''[[daimyō]]s'' that refuse to fight.
Into this chaos is brought the Orochi warrior known as the Emperor's champion, the strongest and most fearsome warrior in the Dawn Empire. The champion was imprisoned for speaking out of turn and was freed during the chaos of the Viking raid. The Orochi helps to push back the Vikings, but fails to prevent Apollyon from riding through the chaos and murdering the Imperial family, forcing the Daimyos to fight one another for supreme rulership as Emperor of the Dawn Empire. After learning of the devastation the Viking raid caused, the Orochi, fellow samurai Ayu, the Shugoki Okuma and Nobushi Momiji attempt to reunite the Daimyos under one banner, using Apollyon as a common enemy to rally against. The Emperor's Champion infiltrates the Emperor's palace with Momiji and confronts Seijuro, the Daimyo who took Apollyon's offer to become Emperor. After defeating Seijuro, the champion convinces him to join him against Apollyon. It is also during this time that the Emperor's Champion learns of Apollyon's manipulations of the various factions and rallies allies to stop Apollyon, invading Ashfeld to attack Blackstone Fortress. During a scouting mission with Momiji, the Orochi is met by the Warden, now leading the rebellious Iron Legion against Apollyon with Holden Cross, Stone and Mercy by his/her side, and after dueling him/her, realizes they are allied against the same enemy. Both armies besiege the castle on separate fronts, with the Orochi searching for Apollyon. After finding Apollyon, the Orochi fights with and kills her, but not before learning that she wanted to create eternal war to weed out the weak and create the strongest of men, making them evermore bloodthirsty. Despite her death, Apollyon got what she wanted: an age of bloodthirsty wolves.
In the aftermath, the armies of all three factions attacking the Blackstone Fortress; Knight, Samurai and Viking alike all turn on each other, resulting in a war lasting seven years. Realizing the war's futility, the Warden, now leader of the Iron Legion, sends Holden Cross to meet with the jarl of the vikings, Stigandr, and the samurai Ayu. Though all three realize that the prospect of peace may be futile, they all agree that peace is worth fighting for and striving for it will make for an unforgettable tale.
