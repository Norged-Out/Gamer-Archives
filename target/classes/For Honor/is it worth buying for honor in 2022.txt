[[is it worth buying for honor in 2022]]





Too unique to not give it a shot. Will take you many hours before you get the hang of it and you will lose a bunch. It's one of the most satisfying games once you get it down though.
    The pain is really bigger than satisfaction
        Eh tbh after 6 years of playing this game I don't get too bothered by it. It's more fair and balanced than it's ever been. Way less moments I'm losing to cheese or something else and more moments of me being why I lost. Still can be frustrating but I don't take it as serious anymore.
            I can’t relate you see my flair 😭
                I practically BEG to get ganked unless I’m playing brawl or duel 😭
                    I prefer a 1 v 1.
Because too many times an ally breaks my GB stabs. XD
And I personally still find handling two or more people harder.
No but worth it in 2023
    As a 2023 player, I can agree
        As a one myself, i can agree with you agreeing
    True, only buy the game next year OP
        Oh no not the next year jokes I wasn’t prepared

It's a mixed bag. If you do buy it, you're going to get absolutely curb stomped by the learning curve for a while.

Since reaction-based gameplay was basically taken out back and shot like an injured horse with the CCU update, the most effective way to play is to memorize the ins and outs of every character's moveset to learn what they can do and when they can do it. 

This game also runs on an old/buggy engine. There will be times when you absolutely parried something, or you threw a crushing counter at just the right moment, or you GB someone half an inch from their face and the game will fuck you over. That's just how it is, and the faster you accept this the less likely you are to punch a hole through your monitor. 

Connection issues are rampant, and the bots that replace players who are Thanos'd by bad ping are either utterly, indescribably stupid or will send you to god, same day shipping. 

In my god's honest opinion, this game is like a drug addiction. The highs are just barely high enough to keep you coming back, but the lows will make you want to break everything in your room.

Proceed at your own risk.
    This is an accurate a review as you can get.
    One pro is a the sheer customization for all the heroes
        Some more than others unfortunately
        Drop your pk drip I’m tryna see it 😭
    Holy shit. This is the most honest and accurate review this game has. And the part about the bots. "Send you to God, same day shipping". I wan a use that
    But you don't have to manually learn the ins and outs of every characters moveset, it comes naturally the more you play the game and the more characters you play. At least it did for me.
    Game is still heavily reactable what u on about
        Not like before tho
            I mean literally everything except 400ms lightd remain reactable af.
                I think he means the game isn't based on reacting to attacks as much as it was before. It's more of a read based game now, that's why every hero is starting to use the secret technique of orange (Everyone is starting to get an unlockable, or some form of a 50/50.)

However, the game still does have a decent focus on reaction still.
                    It still amazes me how people always get downvoted here for saying shit that is literally common knowledge if you are higher skill lvl than garbage tier. But sure lets lose some karma

&#x200B;

There is 1 50/50 in the game and its highlanders kick/grab while enemy is OOS. No other move. Cant wait for no answer or you telling me that random UB heavy is a 50/50.\\

\>I think he means the game isn't based on reacting to attacks as much as it was before. 

he literally said reacting doesnt exist
                        The guy only said that it isn't based on reaction like it was before, he didn't say it isn't for focused on reaction at all. I also said unlockable OR 50/50 because dodge attack option selects exist.
                            Okay but if there is 1 50/50 in the game, the one i pointed out. Whos getting those 50/50s?
                                This example is a bit late, but Kyoshin's bash/undodgeable mix up. There isn't just one 50/50 in the game other heroes have them.
                                    okay but, thats great and all. issue is kyoshins chain bash is one of the easiest to react to and mostly isnt a real mix up in duels. same as any other chain bash like bp.

still waiting for actual example :)
    Good review but there are almost no *buggy/engine* issues. The times you miss a parry, or crushing counter someone is always one you or in the very odd case due to some player on another server visiting through friends or mc donalds wifi. I too love to blame the other player or Ubisoft, but usually it is due to a *bad input*. The game is actually very good at following it’s own set rules(other than JJ bash, and Shinobi flip kick…)
        Behaviour on ladders is sketchy af and that's definitely engine issues. I've been punched off a ladder from so high above the person throwing that they would have had to be Mister Fantastic to land it, and I've thrown punches at people where you can visibly see my fist connect only for them to knock me off the ladder and kill me immediately.
    Said like a rep 200+
    “…the bots that replace players who are Thanos’d by bad ping are either utterly, indescribably stupid or will send you to god, same day shipping.” I’m dead bruh 😭😂😂😂
    >will send you to god, same day shipping

that's crazyy, I'm taking this one
Yes, its worth it.
Yes
Yes.
Yes and no. I hate it but I keep coming back.
    Me too. Maybe Stockholm syndrome is real shit after all..
Do you like high blood pressure?
    And bruised penis?
A simple summary would be is it better than before? Yes but the better question is can you keep up with the skill level and mechanics of the game? If you can then I recommend FH since it’s a unique experience that you will literally never get ever again. But if you can’t then I don’t recommend it since FH can be brutal to new comers
Im still relatively new, and I’d say, but be prepared to swear like a sailor, and maybe a few broken controllers if u rage a lot normally
    If you’ve ever muttered “f**k” under your breath at a game you’re going to need a new TV/Monitor and go through like 3 controllers your first week let’s be honest 😂
        Yeah that’s true lmaooooo😂😂
            Those PS5 controllers got a good build tho. I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve squeezed it as hard as I can trying to snap it out of rage and For Honor and it’s still kicking 🙏🏻😂
No because you can get it for free every where
I mean, the starter edition is only $15. If the game looks interesting to you and you’re willing to work through the learning curve then there isn’t exactly a whole lot at stake.
It's fun when you're still playing in the low levels, but as you progress to the higher reps you'll lose your sanity 😆
Yes
Its one of my favorite games of all times. If you like it, you will love it. I hope to play it for the rest of forever..

That being said, it's incredibly unique and the learning curve is rough to say the least.
No
do you have anger issues?  
if so then no it ain't worth it
If you’re down for adrenaline inducing fights or dealing with nerving heroes who loves to screw your ass down deep into the hell that makes you wonder why you’re playing the game.

Yeah. You should.
yea, its a fun game, id say give it a shot, theres nothing else like it ;)
Yes
Yes, it is. Especially in 2023.
It's always worth it because of it's unique playstyle
Yes
its really bad for your health if you really get into it i have first hand experience. when i uninstalled the game i felt so much better but a part of me can never let go
You’ll get stomped at first, but get past that and it’s fun.
Depends.  Have you already bought and played every other medieval fighting game released in the past 10 years to the point of boredom?  If so, then maybe it is worth it.  

Honestly the only reason I'm still here is a small part of me that really wants this game to succeed, because for some reason it feels like it has so much more potential than the other games, but I've played mordheau and chivalry 2, and they simply are better.  I avoided them for a while cause they looked difficult, but honestly the combat is so smooth and natural it is pretty easy to learn, and for honor in comparison, even with years of practice, feels jagged and janky.  The learning curve is more satisfying to follow, the graphics are better, and it's not overrun with absurd amounts of horrible joke items from weekly content but still have comedic and fun moments.

TLDR: just play mordheau or chivalry 2
    >mordheau or chivalry 2

I'm gonna take a look at these games. I was thinking about getting back into for honor (played during release)
If you're interested, why not? There's no indication that the devs are planning on dropping it just yet.
It is gonna be difficult and will take to learn the mechanics and all the Heroes, but that is where the fun is when you are a beginner at least it was for me, but I guess you gotta try it and find out yourself if u like it. worth IMO
If you hate your life, then yes. Also get ready for a large learning curve and getting obliterated by everyone until you get better.
I wouldn't know I haven't playing for honor since last year
    Play it if you time, hard to believe but balance and content wise its going fantastically
It’s a really fun game but there’s almost no new players so the beginning will definitely suck for you
No
No
if you find it decently cheap then i think 100% yes worth it
Worth the refund for sure
No since it becomes free in a while or the price drops hard in the next months
No, worst game I’ve ever played
i have 100+ hours in For Honor. don’t buy it.
It was never worth it
no
dont
pls dont
No
No
It is only if u are a masochist
No
no
No
no
No.
I mean. It’s a good game. But the state that it’s in with its current devs it’s not worth full price. Only buy it when it’s in a discount
If you have old gen… no. Nothing is reactable anymore and you have to predict every thing anyone does. Besides that, a lot of heroes now have feintable bashes (looking at you tiandi) with buggy animations which are beyond annoying especially when lights are difficult to block against. If you have anything better than old gen, then yes. It will still be aggravatingly annoying but it’s at least playable and you can improve much quicker.
Hm. If you have friends, then maybe. If not then hard no.
Lmao it was never worth it fr
Not really
Not sure what platform you're on and not sure what the price is on For Honor ATM but it is on GamePass, both console and PC for anyone else wanting to try it out
My friend jumped in a couple of days ago actually, and he loves it! Just make sure to play through all the trials in the training menu and maybe spend a little bit of time in training mode getting down parrying and other things and you will be able to do fairly well online. It is on sale for a lot right now, so you aren't missing out on much by getting it rn
Watch gameplay on it. The graphics are amazing but game is really hard and can make you angry. And if you play on play station you can get it for free with ps plus extra
Its free if you have gamepass I believe so yes
Is it ruined yet? It’s halfway to being ruined but if you just get your skills up before everyone turns into a sweat than you can play the game normally
Yes.
Yeah bought it a couple months ago and it’s pretty fun. Combat system unique
Yes, it's like no other. It has a steep learning curve though so I don't know whether it'll be fun for you. I recommend getting someone to help you learn the game.
Wait till next year
Naww for honor 2 dropping in a couple weeks 🙏🏽
It should be in games pass and ps plus, check to see if you can get it in a subscription first
Yes
2023 more like it and yes there is a lot of people that are great to meet
I bought the game in early 2022 so I can’t really compare it with its life cycle before that but I have a feeling that it’s actually comparatively healthy and good currently. Last buffs really helped a lot of heros (like tiandi, highlander, valk etc) to be truly viable (though a bit too much imo) without making others worse, which means you have a good selection of different heros/playstyles. 

The game appears to be actually quite alive, you’ll always find people playing dominion and breach ( + most times brawls). Duells (1v1) can take a bit longer but I usually don’t have to wait more than 1-2 minutes (Europe servers). 

As for myself I can say that for honor isn’t an easy game to actually be good in. You’ll have to invest a lot of time and patience to be decent and for honor can still be extremely frustrating, so if you tend to get really enraged by video games you should really think about it. If you’re able and willing to put in the extra work though the game can feel very rewarding and even addicting (we’re all just chasing a high here).

So I’d recommend the game especially with the last changes the dev team made, it’s by far not a perfect game but it’s probably the best time to buy it
On Xbox you can get it on Gamepass, so the only thing your spending is your sanity and soul.
I say… gamepass 🤙
God there are a lot of people who say no on these things
I really hate it and love it at the same time, you’ll go through the same if you commit to it, buy it but expect at some point to start hating it, and then of course loving it again
yes, buy it when it's on sale. Get the standard edition
There's a learning curve for sure! And it will be tough for you in the beginning. But don't get down about it. You don't have to jump right into PVP - you can turn off matchmaking and play against AI bots while you're learning the ropes. You earn more XP and rewards for playing PVP but that's just the trade off.
Too late now😎
If you are good at gaming and learn quickly then yes. Otherwise you will hate yourself…
Yes I'm also very new to this game and i am loving it and also this game is on sale right now so now is a good time to buy it.
No
The answer is no. Use Xbox game pass to play it, it’s got Marching Fire edition. If you’re on PS wait for it to go on sale I guess. The games fun, it’s different than most “fighters” and it’s got a pretty good amount of content with the different characters, movesets, ability etc. but it is NOT worth paying $40 (which I think is full price) when you can get Marching Fire ($60 I’m pretty sure) and 100+ other games for $1/month your first 3 months. If you want to give it a shot even just to see if you’ll like it get game pass for a month and learn to play. Just my recommendation ig 🤷🏻‍♂️
    I was wrong, starter edition is $15, Marching Fire is $25 at least on steam and the ultimate edition or whatever it’s called is $40, but still, if you have the opportunity use game pass to try it out. Much cheaper and better option for someone picking it up for the first time/first time in years. I bought the starter edition a few years back and got Marching Fire with game pass and wish I wouldn’t have spent the $15 then because I play SO MANY of the games on game pass and it only costs me $15/month
 yea
I'd say so, they still add new content, learning curve is steep tho you will lose A LOT. The game is one of a kind and pretty old so I wouldn't pay full price, especially because it's not beginner friendly. I tried it 3 times in the same number of years before I got into it, but it's on sale quite often
I did
I absolutely think it's a wonderful game.

Cons:

* Chronically addictive (like most multiplayer competitive games)
* Can be frustrating at times in regards to balancing: you may have a garbage team vs. an elite squad that can parry your attacks before you even knew you wanted to do them.

Pros: 

* Really interesting setting and themes: I super dig the world, find it really cool
* The characters/heroes are phenomenal and look absolutely gorgeous each in their own right. You can really customise them to make them feel like your own, too.
* The variation between fighting styles is really broad. You will absolutely find a hero you love and want to stick with.
* When you play well, the game is so immersive and tactile that you feel exceptionally competent; like you could defeat anyone.
* The actual gameplay is really engaging, in part due to the above but on a deeper level, too. For me, it's the ultimate 'fighting' game. I've bounced off a few different ones and came into For Honor after not enjoying Soul Calibur 6. I know people will disagree, but in my mind it is a fighting game, and it's the best one I've played by a long shot. I genuinely believe it's flawless for what it is.

Happy to answer more Q's. I deleted it as I was playing it too much, but I stand by my feelings for the game. I think it's incredible. Don't worry if you can't get the more expensive editions on sale - they're on sale fairly often.

I loved it so much that I started with the standard edition (I think I got it for free), then bought Marching Fire, then upgraded to the Complete Edition. It was worth the money for me.
I’m on Xbox and it’s on gamepass so I haven’t paid but if it ever leaves I’m going to end up paying for it just to have it
I think so it’s fun sometimes it is definitely difficult though. I also believe it might be on sale now so it would for sure be worth it
I've been thinking about upgrading from free play myself.
No
It sucks. Buy it.
It was free like 2 years ago… yea give it a shot
It’s my favorite game. It has very steep learning curve. I actually hated this game and had no fun when I first started but once I got past the pain of learning it quickly became my favorite game. I think it’s worth it though but I could be biased. Customization is fun and combat can make you feel unstoppable once you get good.
it's $7 and if you get the starter you get two free heroes I believe similar to R6. Think of it this way if you at least paid for a few hours you only paid $1 for each hour of enjoyment perhaps especially if you're not playing it alone, it's one of those games that can't really reside in a category having its own almost.  


Plus I'd imagine you have an income of sorts so why not? it's not as expensive as most triple-A titles that are usually outshined by some random indie(not that I'm saying Ubisoft is a small indie company)
100% worth it, but just be aware there is a STEEP learning curve
The pain is really bigger than satisfaction
    Eh tbh after 6 years of playing this game I don't get too bothered by it. It's more fair and balanced than it's ever been. Way less moments I'm losing to cheese or something else and more moments of me being why I lost. Still can be frustrating but I don't take it as serious anymore.
        I can’t relate you see my flair 😭
            I practically BEG to get ganked unless I’m playing brawl or duel 😭
                I prefer a 1 v 1.
Because too many times an ally breaks my GB stabs. XD
And I personally still find handling two or more people harder.
As a 2023 player, I can agree
    As a one myself, i can agree with you agreeing

I practically BEG to get ganked unless I’m playing brawl or duel 😭
    I prefer a 1 v 1.
Because too many times an ally breaks my GB stabs. XD
And I personally still find handling two or more people harder.
I think he means the game isn't based on reacting to attacks as much as it was before. It's more of a read based game now, that's why every hero is starting to use the secret technique of orange (Everyone is starting to get an unlockable, or some form of a 50/50.)

However, the game still does have a decent focus on reaction still.
    It still amazes me how people always get downvoted here for saying shit that is literally common knowledge if you are higher skill lvl than garbage tier. But sure lets lose some karma

There is 1 50/50 in the game and its highlanders kick/grab while enemy is OOS. No other move. Cant wait for no answer or you telling me that random UB heavy is a 50/50.\\

\>I think he means the game isn't based on reacting to attacks as much as it was before. 

he literally said reacting doesnt exist
        The guy only said that it isn't based on reaction like it was before, he didn't say it isn't for focused on reaction at all. I also said unlockable OR 50/50 because dodge attack option selects exist.
            Okay but if there is 1 50/50 in the game, the one i pointed out. Whos getting those 50/50s?
                This example is a bit late, but Kyoshin's bash/undodgeable mix up. There isn't just one 50/50 in the game other heroes have them.
                    okay but, thats great and all. issue is kyoshins chain bash is one of the easiest to react to and mostly isnt a real mix up in duels. same as any other chain bash like bp.
