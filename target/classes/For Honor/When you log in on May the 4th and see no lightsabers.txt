[[When you log in on May the 4th and see no lightsabers]]





Ah man, I was planning on coming back just for today  :(
    Same, and a permanent lazer sword would have bought me back full time... Ahhh well (sad face).
        *For Honor: Star Wars* when, Ubisoft??? I know EA is sitting on the license, but as soon as that contract is up, snatch it up quick as a bunny please. We need this.
            Even tho I do agree a Star Wars with For Honor mechanics will be cool. What worries me is that they (Ubi) do the same mistakes.

Though one thing is for sure. If there is a Centurion but with force powers. I am in.
                Force kick! Kick people off ledges from 10 feet away!
                    [removed]
                        Warlord still has to get close at some point
                    Imagine Tiandi’s force kick lol.
                        Oh god
                            Right?! He’d have people flying from one end of the map to the other.
                    Tiandi be like
                    We already have Tiandi
                I would not trust ubi with star wars license. Hell no
                    Between EA or Ubi, both are crap don't get me wrong, I would take the latter. Not by much tho
            Lmao.

*Dinsey* sits on that license.

And they let EA games stick their dirty paws under their ass to use it.

Battlefront 2 was Strikes 2 & 3 for EA games if they fuckup another star wars title 100% I bet Disney will pull the plug on their operation.

The day one of their reddit accounts posted that comment, you know *the most downvoted comment in history?*

The CEO of Disney reached out to CEO of EA games directly and told them to knock their shit off pretty much.
That’s why there’s no loot crates apart from some pressure from the courts considering it as gambling.
        Personally, i think the lightsaber effect was very distracting, especially when they were the same shade of red as the indicators. Although some people enjoyed it.
    Same though brother.

It did not go the way I thought
    Yea seriously, May 1st is my birthday and last year I was out of town for a week watching everyone play with lightsabers, now this year I got the virus for my birthday and couldn't wait to get up and play and I see this. 😥 F*** My Life
    Same, Haven't booted up the game in 4 months, was excited for today lmao.

Ah well, plenty of other games.
    Don't work ubi is working on it
    I was thinking of reinstalling just for it too
*Impossible.Perhaps the archives are incomplete.*
It might drop midday like the April fools event.
    But, the april fools event dropped midnight for me😂🤷🏻‍♂️
        Same for me I just say midday because most people here are Americans.
            Wait, im american
                *Visible confusion*
                    (☝︎ ՞ਊ ՞)☝︎
                        Lol
                            Confused *RHAAA*
                                Fuus ro DAHHH
                                    Ah yes brothers in eternal screaming
                Lesbian? I thought  you wee American
                I thought you were lesbian
                Wait, me too
            It dropped at 11pm the night before for me. And I’m American. I thought for sure it was a weird glitch because of the timing so I recorded it but then I remembered April Fools. Anyway that mode made team fighting a nightmare lol.
            Midday and midnight are different
            A year ago, this unofficial event started at 4-5 PM UTC. I checked it against old posts like this:

                Awww you shoulda said I checked it in the archives
            I'm American and it dropped at 10 at night
                I'm  Portuguese and i don't remember
    ***It is what it is***                                             >!Fuck man!<    ^we ded
    Is there an event ?
    
"If an item does not appear by 10am, it does not exist”
“Yeah For Honor didn’t get lightsabers...

EA/DICE abandoned Battlefront 2...

And there’s a worldwide pandemic.

But the new Clone Wars is great!”
    And the clone wars is finished :(

Cant we just have this one For Honor? This is the worst star wars day ever
        Dude, we got an *amazing* Clone Wars finale. Don't be sad because it's over, be happy because it happened.

Also, the day is not over yet. If I know the people at Lucasfilm right, they'll have a boatload of news ready to drop later today.

Maybe we'll get more info on the Cassian Andor or Kenobi shows, maybe a trailer for Mandalorian season 2? Perhaps some news about a potential sequel series to Rebels (with more Ahsoka in it)?

There's most likely going to be news about upcoming books and comics, that's almost a guarantee.
            Clone Wars is over and it was a masterpiece.If we don't get the For Honor event I will be disappointed but at least I know that Avatar The Last Airbender will be on Netflix on May 15th and we will get that "Firebending" emote on the 21st.
                Wait there is a fire bending emote?
                    Zanhu's Fire I think that's what it's called. It wasn't meant to be Firebending but it sure as hell looks like it.
                        Ooo might have to pick it up. Just got the Vortiger emote but I got some steel left lol.
                            You've got a lot of time to get more steel till the 21st
                                Yeah I have 18k right now but I am saving as much as I can do I can get some other things from these events.
                                    Yeah bless Unisoft for bringing back some of these events and items cause I just started playing for honor when zanhu came out and I spent all my steel on nobushi cause I have the starter edition and everyone costs 8.000 and above.Also update there will be a downtime for an update today.People on Twitter myself included are speculating that they will give us the lightsabers today because it's Revenge of the 5th.
            > Cassian Andor

Wait. Who? Who is that?
                [This guy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay9qg-leLlo)
                    Imma be real with you. I do not remember Rouge One. But I de belive that a series based around people that arent a part of the main Skywalker family is a good idea so Ill look forward to watching the series
    Ok luis
    Username checks out.

Also, big sad time about no lightsabers. 😔
    Fortnite got lightsabers though rip
    And that's over today too 😢
    And the fallen order update!
        Yeah I was literally jumping in my bed when I saw the news
    Fallen Order got the stuff everyone was asking for, except Jedi robes, but that's least important. Now there's NG+ and in it, you can play simulated battles even against bosses. There's also a mode that lets you create your own scenario.

I can't wait to try it.
    We don't talk about BFV here
        Rumor is that EA/DICE pulled the support from Battlefront 2 because they want everyhting focused on BFVI (considering what a dumpsterfire was BFV). What makes me even sadder that it happened in an insant. There were  no signs, it just happened.
            Wait really? Wow. That team did such an amazing job when left to their own devices.
            I bought BFV 50% off and still think It was a waste of money. Give me BF1 over that shit any day.
                Honestly bfv felt generic to me I believe that they didn't have a vision for the theme they wanted to portray they didn't want to go with any dark tones so they could add their own "ideas" to it and in return the game didn't have any redeeming personality about it

Bf1 on the other side doesn't even feel like fps game some times the mean thing they wanted to portray in that game was the grant dark war and gameplay even tho it was good it took a backseat , I've never felt like that playing an fps

Bf4 was just pure fun, obviously had to bring bf4 in the conversation for no reason

So these 3 games r very different

One focuses on fun

The other on immersion

And the last one well like I said we don't talk about bfV
I expected nothing and am still dissapointed
    The official For Honor experience!
        Too true
This saves me time on checking if lightsabers were up
    same i was gonna boot up and check but decided to just check reddit instead
Ill never forgot how i found out about lightsabers. I was getting drunk with my friend over xbox playing various games as well as drinking games. After enough shots we were wasted and decided to 1v1 on FH for the fun of it, to see whos better intoxicated. I loaded the match and choose shaolin. The excitement on my face will never be replaceable as we both went ape shit over it. I then immediately proceeded to play duel of the fates into my mic and we made a "no parry" rule so that we can just see the sparks fly. please ubi bring it back :(
    Shaolin was like Darth Maul with the red saber was so sick
    Why are we still here...
    He was sick man, but Orochi light spam never looked so good 😍
        Silence infidel
        >Fallen Order

As much as I'd hate to admit it, I cant help but agree. It was the only time in the history of For Honor where I literally enjoyed seeing Orochi light spam. The game looked and felt amazing......\*sigh\*
It ought to be here... but it isn’t
Yea last year was fun maybe it drops later today
    I hope ;(
I wish they’d atleast tell us that they’re not gonna do it rather than just let us guess
        Definitely, small things like this are always fun times to play and joke around so I hope it’s coming
            I’ll give it until 2:30

If it’s not there by then, I think I’m going to cry
                I live in Europe so that will be in the evening for me I guess
                    Same here
                        Nice well we can only hope
        Right? Isn’t this what the community manager is for? I don’t particularly care about star wars but the general lack of communication / Ubi presence here is not exactly inspiring
My game just restarted for no reason... maybe it’s now :O
Edit: It’s not ;((((((((
Lies! Deception!
    It’s unfair
There's a scheduled maintenance tomorrow but I don't think they'll add it today :( my birthday is today and I missed it last year I was soo looking forward to this
    Wow that also happened to me
    Man my birthday is tomorrow so I felt this
This is not INCREDIBILIS
Heartbroken, waited eagerly all year for this 😔

Let's hope ubisoft are in discussions with Disney to make a starwars version of for honor 😁
*Sad ad mortem*
    Sad Mortem?
I was low key hurt this morning:( Why Ubi?
Why are we here?
    Just to suffer?
NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I guess the Mouse wouldn’t let us have our fun today.
This is all i woke up for today
Damn my heart 💔
Awww I was so looking forward to that. I missed it last year
It's treason then
There’s maintenance tomorrow hopefully there putting it in the store for us to buy
Its naive to think it would come back, they did it once, if they do it again, disney will undoubtedly take notice
They need to just make this an option to turn on in custom games
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
That's not very cash money of you Ubisoft
Man I was looking forward to this all day. Doing my 3 o'clock appointment 💩 then hopping on. Ain't gonna stop me from jamming buttfuckit-incontuckit
I keep missing this event due to work. The one time I stay home and this happens 🤦🏿‍♂️
I would pay good money for a combat game like for honor, but star wars. For honors combat system on a star wars game would be sick
Give it until like 10 AM!
    what timezone?
        my guess would be EDT
    Nibba it’s 2:30 P.M in Germany
I mised this event last year and I was ready for this year and nothing. Pffff. Get lost Ubi :(
And that’s why my morning was spent on battlefront 2
Its 12 o'clock still nothing. D:
I was not expecting that, but I was expecting not to expect something so it doesn't count.
*deception, disgraaaaaace, evil as plain as the scar on your face*
    *UBI'S NOT. OOOONE OF UUUUS\~*
Sad mortem
Sad mortem... Sadibilis !
I think it didn't get patched in yet. Mabye in a few hours we'll get it?
    Let's hope
Theres supposed to be lightsabers?
    Were last year
Usually events start for me at 10 AM Pacific daylight Time.
Don’t think daily reset has happened yet.
I've made a sticker out of it
So sad
I basically missed that event so I hope it comes back. I also missed the rabbid invasion event but... I'm ok with that.
....holy fuck that was last year? Jesus
FUCK, bro
I guess grandma isn’t coming out then.
they not doing it this year??
My disappointed is immeasurable, and my day is ruined
This is sad
Sadibilis
I just wanted laser Zhanhu 😔
I’ve always missed it and I logged on super excited to try it today. Oh well :(
it hurt when i log in after a while and hear no effects or have a glowing blue weapon
*my disappointment is immeasurable and my year is ruined*
Yeah I was disappointed
This is the biggest disappointment since the last 3 years of the game
Hehe UBISHIT
Boys they might give us the lightsabers today since they said they'll be a maintenance today and it's Revenge of the 5th.
I stayed up till mid night just to see what was coming and then nothing so I went to sleep to still see nothing. Yay
Fudge
Why didn’t they do it this year
Rip lightsabers 2019-2020
I know
My birthday no lightsaber😭
They better do it again. There's literally no good reason not to have it in the game. This was the one thing I looked forward to today.
Never really was a fan of that. Oh I LOVE _Star Wars_ don’t mistake me, but I don’t mix my broccoli with my mashed potatoes when it comes to it if you catch my meaning. I play _For Honor_ for cold steel and pseudo-historical matchups, which is a very different kind of fantasy than the one offered by _Star Wars_.
    No I don’t catch your drift
        What I meant was, the appeal of _Star Wars_ specifically kind of gets diluted when you simply translate the surface level aesthetics to something else. A lightsaber is more than a laser sword so giving them to everyone kind of makes them less special.
            I mean it’s a one day event dude
                I didn't say I had some huge problem with it like I would stop playing the game or anything. Just said I "never really was a fan."
it be feeling like that doe
small indie dev team, please understand
Unpopular opinion, but I'm totally fine it didn't return.
    Same, I love star wars and all but like it was fun for one game then just became obnoxious. Props to ubi for making it and all but it was just annoying.
They aren’t in the game because of legal issues with Disney. It’s stupid, I know.
    [deleted]
        Got any proof for that? We know Disney are a bunch of dicks when it comes to stuff like this so it's not an unfair assumption to make
            [deleted]
                Plus, why would Disney want to shut this down? The game wouldn’t be making any money from it unless they sold a skin or something, and other than that it’s just free advertising for Star Wars
                No, but they can make the argument it infringes on the Star Wars IP. 
If they didn't, we'd see ALOT more in media
Tuff
Oof
So disappointed
Wait, there are none?
Imma be honest, I'm kinda glad, cause I couldn't play today, and the thought of not being there for the lightsabers really bummed me.
    “If I can’t have it, NO ONE CAN!”
        Pretty much :D
Ubi has abandoned their fan base for this game. From creating a battle pass for a game with multiple issues, to broken mechanics (some as old as year one), to doing everything in their power to make sure Test Your Metal never appears again. I get it with the lightsabers. Borderline running into copyright issues with The Mouse. But other than that, really starting to lose faith in Ubi.
Maybe it will drop at a later date and for a longer time than the original event
Do you think its because people always complain about the events
Plzz bing the light sabers back. Make it a setting you can turn on or off 

I beg you goober-soft 🙏
Same, and a permanent lazer sword would have bought me back full time... Ahhh well (sad face).
    *For Honor: Star Wars* when, Ubisoft??? I know EA is sitting on the license, but as soon as that contract is up, snatch it up quick as a bunny please. We need this.

Is there an event ?

"If an item does not appear by 10am, it does not exist”
And the clone wars is finished :(

Cant we just have this one For Honor? This is the worst star wars day ever
    Dude, we got an *amazing* Clone Wars finale. Don't be sad because it's over, be happy because it happened.

Also, the day is not over yet. If I know the people at Lucasfilm right, they'll have a boatload of news ready to drop later today.

Maybe we'll get more info on the Cassian Andor or Kenobi shows, maybe a trailer for Mandalorian season 2? Perhaps some news about a potential sequel series to Rebels (with more Ahsoka in it)?

There's most likely going to be news about upcoming books and comics, that's almost a guarantee.

Also, big sad time about no lightsabers. 😔
Fortnite got lightsabers though rip
And that's over today too 😢
And the fallen order update!
    Yeah I was literally jumping in my bed when I saw the news

As much as I'd hate to admit it, I cant help but agree. It was the only time in the history of For Honor where I literally enjoyed seeing Orochi light spam. The game looked and felt amazing......\*sigh\*
I hope ;(
I wish they’d atleast tell us that they’re not gonna do it rather than just let us guess
    Definitely, small things like this are always fun times to play and joke around so I hope it’s coming
        I’ll give it until 2:30

If it’s not there by then, I think I’m going to cry
            I live in Europe so that will be in the evening for me I guess
                Same here
                    Nice well we can only hope
    Right? Isn’t this what the community manager is for? I don’t particularly care about star wars but the general lack of communication / Ubi presence here is not exactly inspiring
It’s unfair
Wow that also happened to me
Man my birthday is tomorrow so I felt this
Sad Mortem?
Just to suffer?
what timezone?
    my guess would be EDT
Nibba it’s 2:30 P.M in Germany
*UBI'S NOT. OOOONE OF UUUUS\~*
Let's hope
Were last year
No I don’t catch your drift
    What I meant was, the appeal of _Star Wars_ specifically kind of gets diluted when you simply translate the surface level aesthetics to something else. A lightsaber is more than a laser sword so giving them to everyone kind of makes them less special.
        I mean it’s a one day event dude
            I didn't say I had some huge problem with it like I would stop playing the game or anything. Just said I "never really was a fan."
Same, I love star wars and all but like it was fun for one game then just became obnoxious. Props to ubi for making it and all but it was just annoying.

    Got any proof for that? We know Disney are a bunch of dicks when it comes to stuff like this so it's not an unfair assumption to make
        [deleted]
            Plus, why would Disney want to shut this down? The game wouldn’t be making any money from it unless they sold a skin or something, and other than that it’s just free advertising for Star Wars
            No, but they can make the argument it infringes on the Star Wars IP. 
If they didn't, we'd see ALOT more in media
“If I can’t have it, NO ONE CAN!”
    Pretty much :D
*For Honor: Star Wars* when, Ubisoft??? I know EA is sitting on the license, but as soon as that contract is up, snatch it up quick as a bunny please. We need this.
    Even tho I do agree a Star Wars with For Honor mechanics will be cool. What worries me is that they (Ubi) do the same mistakes.

Though one thing is for sure. If there is a Centurion but with force powers. I am in.
        Force kick! Kick people off ledges from 10 feet away!
            [removed]
                Warlord still has to get close at some point
            Imagine Tiandi’s force kick lol.
                Oh god
                    Right?! He’d have people flying from one end of the map to the other.
            Tiandi be like
            We already have Tiandi
        I would not trust ubi with star wars license. Hell no
            Between EA or Ubi, both are crap don't get me wrong, I would take the latter. Not by much tho
    Lmao.

*Dinsey* sits on that license.

And they let EA games stick their dirty paws under their ass to use it.

Battlefront 2 was Strikes 2 & 3 for EA games if they fuckup another star wars title 100% I bet Disney will pull the plug on their operation.

The day one of their reddit accounts posted that comment, you know *the most downvoted comment in history?*

The CEO of Disney reached out to CEO of EA games directly and told them to knock their shit off pretty much.
That’s why there’s no loot crates apart from some pressure from the courts considering it as gambling.
Personally, i think the lightsaber effect was very distracting, especially when they were the same shade of red as the indicators. Although some people enjoyed it.
Same for me I just say midday because most people here are Americans.
    Wait, im american
        *Visible confusion*
            (☝︎ ՞ਊ ՞)☝︎
                Lol
                    Confused *RHAAA*
                        Fuus ro DAHHH
                            Ah yes brothers in eternal screaming
        Lesbian? I thought  you wee American
        I thought you were lesbian
        Wait, me too
    It dropped at 11pm the night before for me. And I’m American. I thought for sure it was a weird glitch because of the timing so I recorded it but then I remembered April Fools. Anyway that mode made team fighting a nightmare lol.
    Midday and midnight are different
    A year ago, this unofficial event started at 4-5 PM UTC. I checked it against old posts like this:

        Awww you shoulda said I checked it in the archives
    I'm American and it dropped at 10 at night
        I'm  Portuguese and i don't remember
Dude, we got an *amazing* Clone Wars finale. Don't be sad because it's over, be happy because it happened.

Also, the day is not over yet. If I know the people at Lucasfilm right, they'll have a boatload of news ready to drop later today.

Maybe we'll get more info on the Cassian Andor or Kenobi shows, maybe a trailer for Mandalorian season 2? Perhaps some news about a potential sequel series to Rebels (with more Ahsoka in it)?

There's most likely going to be news about upcoming books and comics, that's almost a guarantee.
    Clone Wars is over and it was a masterpiece.If we don't get the For Honor event I will be disappointed but at least I know that Avatar The Last Airbender will be on Netflix on May 15th and we will get that "Firebending" emote on the 21st.
        Wait there is a fire bending emote?
            Zanhu's Fire I think that's what it's called. It wasn't meant to be Firebending but it sure as hell looks like it.
                Ooo might have to pick it up. Just got the Vortiger emote but I got some steel left lol.
                    You've got a lot of time to get more steel till the 21st
                        Yeah I have 18k right now but I am saving as much as I can do I can get some other things from these events.
                            Yeah bless Unisoft for bringing back some of these events and items cause I just started playing for honor when zanhu came out and I spent all my steel on nobushi cause I have the starter edition and everyone costs 8.000 and above.Also update there will be a downtime for an update today.People on Twitter myself included are speculating that they will give us the lightsabers today because it's Revenge of the 5th.
    > Cassian Andor

Wait. Who? Who is that?
        [This guy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay9qg-leLlo)
            Imma be real with you. I do not remember Rouge One. But I de belive that a series based around people that arent a part of the main Skywalker family is a good idea so Ill look forward to watching the series
Yeah I was literally jumping in my bed when I saw the news
Rumor is that EA/DICE pulled the support from Battlefront 2 because they want everyhting focused on BFVI (considering what a dumpsterfire was BFV). What makes me even sadder that it happened in an insant. There were  no signs, it just happened.
    Wait really? Wow. That team did such an amazing job when left to their own devices.
    I bought BFV 50% off and still think It was a waste of money. Give me BF1 over that shit any day.
        Honestly bfv felt generic to me I believe that they didn't have a vision for the theme they wanted to portray they didn't want to go with any dark tones so they could add their own "ideas" to it and in return the game didn't have any redeeming personality about it

Bf1 on the other side doesn't even feel like fps game some times the mean thing they wanted to portray in that game was the grant dark war and gameplay even tho it was good it took a backseat , I've never felt like that playing an fps

Bf4 was just pure fun, obviously had to bring bf4 in the conversation for no reason

So these 3 games r very different

One focuses on fun

The other on immersion

And the last one well like I said we don't talk about bfV
Too true
Silence infidel
>Fallen Order

As much as I'd hate to admit it, I cant help but agree. It was the only time in the history of For Honor where I literally enjoyed seeing Orochi light spam. The game looked and felt amazing......\*sigh\*
Definitely, small things like this are always fun times to play and joke around so I hope it’s coming
    I’ll give it until 2:30

If it’s not there by then, I think I’m going to cry
        I live in Europe so that will be in the evening for me I guess
