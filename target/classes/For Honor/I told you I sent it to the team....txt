[[I told you I sent it to the team...]]





What the actual fuck

The best meme on this sub literally came from the devs themself
    We don't deserve them.
        This has me almost thinking about reinstalling uplay...
            Why do people hate UPlay so much? It's pretty common for companies to have their own launcher nowadays.

I start UPlay, I start For Honor, I close For Honor, I close UPlay, that's the only interaction that I have with it, why do people think that the launcher is literally Hitler?
                Let me start by saying the logo looks really dumb. Like someone designed this in 1998 and is to proud of it to let go. Also minor problems come up time to time rocking the 2 overlays.

But to be perfectly honest, it's less about the launcher and more about Ubisoft. It's kinda like EA and origin.

        I'd appreciate actual updates even more
            go away no fun person
                I'm really surprised by how many downvotes I have received. I didn't even say that Vultcano is stupid or anything.

        He earned it today; as opposed to when you bought the game? Who the fuck hasn't been paying /u/MrEricPope out of the game sell pot?
            [deleted]
                I'm also thinking of trying it out now. I got it for free with a monitor purchase, but never tried it yet. Time to download :)
    Now that is some good Dev-community relationship!
    What the fuck!
Look at that Running Cow!
OMG!!!!We could make a meme for this!
Deus moo, long live the king of the cows!
    The developers of this game are hilarious. This had me dying when he started to charge
I feel like the guy meant something else when he asked for cows in the game but this is ok I guess 
    I could go for one event day where all the different characters are a bull or some other animal.
        You mean like April fools?

Guild wars has done something like that every April fool's for the last 15 years ish.
            You mean Master OX?
        Sheep? And WOLVES? *trigger*
    THERE IS A COW LEVEL AFTER ALL
        Moo!
        No no no, there is no cow level.

The loading screen says so.
what the literal fuck
    I’m here from r/all and to be honest, that was my first reaction. Lmao, that’s pretty badass though. 
        They're just milking it for karma.
            I’m udderly disappointed.
                This is moosic to my steers. 
                Why didn’t you go with udderly ?
                    Your steer-ing off into a bad topic.
            That's a bull.  And that ain't milk...
    Looks like the Rodeo is back in town!
        Looks like meats back on the menu boys!
    it came from a joke request on this sub
        Do you have a source to the original link?
            https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/82zqmu/ubisoft_can_you_put_a_cow_or_two_in_this_game/
                Thanks. I just don’t understand why the guy asked for a cow in the game. Something about donkeys?
                    No real reason. There were donkeys added in the latest maps, maybe the guy was zonked and thinking about cows who knows
                        Wait really? That makes more sense now. Which new maps? 
                            Just the one, my bad, the marketplace one 
# I've sent it to the team
Shoutout to our animator Mathieu who stayed late last night to do this on his own. 

For reference, this is in response to /u/Snugglebull who posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/82zqmu/ubisoft_can_you_put_a_cow_or_two_in_this_game/

    APRIL FOOLS DAY PLEASE ERIC. PLEASE.
        Master OX
        Dude yes!!
    give my thanks to mathieu
    Lets hear it for Mathieu
    this is beautiful I've been looking at it for an hour now almost nonstop thank you
    Might not be the freefolk subreddit but mathieu is a right proper lad
    You could say Mathieu is .... a dedicated server of memes ^^^badumtsss
    Thay Mathieu guy deseves a raise!
    We don’t deserve you pope, you and the team are amazing
    You know you have to feature this on the Warrior's Den. 

NEW CHARACTER FOR SEASON 5 UNLOCKED
    Can we get an event with velociraptor minions next? 
    *slowclap*
    You are a mad man
    Year 2 knight confirmed 
    Damn. You guys are the shit. Keep up the good work.
    Needs more ponies.
    Holy shit... This is amazing Hahaha 
    Give metal gear orochi please or a very similar version of it. Could even make him a gundam. 
    Just brilliant. Thank you 
    You guys are just the best.
The warden buff we deserve 
    But no the one we need right now.
That's uhh... That's a water-buffalo.
    (*Heavily armored Knight leaves the bush*) "If it moos!" (*Ques burly Viking leaves another bush*) "Then its a cow!"
        **ALL KNIGHTS ..... ARE COWS!** 
        I wish said characters the best of luck in milking this cow, then. Also, just realized I'm mistaken, it's an African or Cape Buffalo.
            Well we all know raider has that under control. We all know his motto doesn't mean nothing after all, you know "LEDGE, THEN DAIRY" I'm pretty sure he has that under control.
                I hope for his sake that the model isn't based on a male buffalo... I have a feeling he doesn't have the WIS score to be able to differentiate.
                    Pfft..... if he can military press a Shugoki then he got this
    No, it's a cebu
I swear the devs love shitposting more than most of us players
    You're not wrong.
I love the developers of this game 
    Boooo Roman!

Oh shit, did Pope just leak one of the Year 2 heroes? Could get into real trouble for this.
    Always thought ForHonor was pvp....

Is their campaign and PVE modes?

Looks like an awesome game
        There are PVP, PVE (Bots), and a campaign
Should we expect an april first update where every character is replaced by an animal?
    Cow level?
        If this  is a diablo reference, god I wish

                Bro, I said this in Cain’s voice. Ouch. Right in the feels. 
                Must... fight... the urge... to start a new D2 campaign...

They made new games /u/o0drwurm0o! Some of them are even objectively better than Diablo 2! You have a computer than can run any game on the market! Why go back to that 800x600 hell?!

I can’t believe you’ve done this.
    read it with a british accent
        every damn time. Probably because I'm British though.

        Wow!

Wow!

Is what people spam in chat when they’re surprised by something. 
all of humanity, every step of our evolution has led to this single moment. our magnum opus. our destiny.
This game is just a playable meme now, isn't it?
    The new skyrim.
So, about that Age of Wolves event. .

Let’s get some wolves on the battlefield!
    Wolves vs sheep
    Age of Cows, excuse me.
This is the high quality shit posting I wake up in the morning for.
99% sure that’s a water buffaloe 
MrEricPope You and your team are the absolute best devs in gaming history! Also I agree with the people asking for April Fools! Please please do this
To those from r/all, there has been a meme of people wanting cows in the game, and the community head commented on these posts saying “sent to the team..” no one expected it to go this far
Came here for Diablo 2 jokes. I guess I’m too old.
    Searched the comments for Diablo 2 jokes, only found this. Have an upvote. 
        What a sad world we live in, friend.
    You aint old enough. That was a Diablo 1 joke... Damn, that makes me the oldest doesn't it? :-(
        That depends. Can you dupe me a kings sword of haste?
            Hold on while I split my pile of gold coins...
    They were in the original post, sorry they didn't make it here.
    moo?
It’s official. For Honor has the best team ever. 
ITS THE SECRET COW LEVEL 
    The secret cow level does not exist.
        SHUT
            Moooo....
                moooooo?
                    Moo moo moo moo, moo. Moo.
                        Moo! Moo! Moo!
Even the devs are shitposting now, in their own game no less!
So like what now? Do we stop making memes? Like, there's literally no way we can best this. The devs are Incredibiles 
    Until the day the devs make sexy armor and lewd content, we have work to do

New Warden rework looks risky, but I like it.
People were always telling me this game would never get better. *oh how wrong they were*
This game is for honor? 
    Yes, the cow isn’t in the actual game though (yet)
OH MY GOD 😆

u/MrEricPope this is INCREDIBILIS
Great to see you guys popular on /r/all, this is amazing. Gonna have to come back to the game — how are things since season 2?
    One major change was that parries, be they light or heavy, no longer guarantee guardbreaks (no more parry-->instant death via ledges), you just get a light punish on h.parry and vice versa, though some things like Lawbringer's AD MORTEM l.parry punish remain due to the time window, as intended. Salvage can be used for xp boosts. Tribute exists, a new game mode. Conqueror & Kensei got their formidable reworks. ...and other neat things :3
    They rebalanced a lot of stuff and have dedicated servers, so no more reason disconnects or poor connections ruining the fun. 
Well my day has been made.
Should’ve been Raider. So he could, you know ^^^stampede ^^^charge
For Honor's gotten weird since I last played...
Assassins Creed: Final Fantasy DLC
GR Wildlands: Predator DLC 
R6 Siege: Zombie alien DLC
For Honor: COWS...dlc???
Matador next hero ?
Can you imagine joining a random match seeing this shit
Whoever did this deserves a raise 
i fucking love you guys

This is my favorite thing I've ever seen on any subreddit. Wow. Well done. 
To be honest Mr Eric Pope and whole dev team are the ones who are responsible for my addiction to For Honor, you guys are amazing!
It’s the secret cow level! Cow king!
Best devs
HOLY COW
Inb4 Rule 4
Year 2 Hero leak
Delete this
holy fuck I wasn't ready.  
Please do this for April Fools.
What game is this? I’m out of the loop
    You are literally in the game's subreddit.
        Lol 
    It's For Honor
And the crowd goes moo!
Age Of Hooves 
    Age of Cows: Sheep, Wolves, Cows ^^(And ^^donkeys ^^Ig) should become an official season! Or a seperate faction? Or 4v4 event?
Well, pack it up fellas. No meme will ever top this
I need this game 
FOR NARNIA!
if this isn't in the next update I'm uninstalling
I know it's a Yak, but I'm still going with the tired old adage "like a bull in a China shop"
You guys are quickly becoming my favorite dev studio. 
At least now I know that For Honor needs to be open-source.
i would honestly love to see a chicken as a peacekeeper
This popped up for me from r/all

Don’t even recognize the game but now I must buy it
You guys deserve a raise. All of you.
now *this* is shitposting
    No this is podracing
I have no words 

Damn, I did not expect to see the Warden rework this soon
What the fuck
If you can do this... cant we turn this into star wars and give knights a plume manually?!
I dunno what I expected but that wasn't it 
/u/MrEricPope This needs to be an april fools joke where every hero is an animal :D
This is the greatest thing to ever happen to For Honor
ALL HAIL POPE SAMA
Biggest, best laugh I've had in a while. Glad you guys have such a good sense of humor!  Love  yu.
There is no secret cow level!
make an event where everybody uses this skin NOW
I couldn't be prouder of the devs right now
    add a fucken cow in the game BUT not a Daubeny symbols...
April fools please
I felt the need to comment. But I'm at a loss for words. Amazing :'D
This is utterly amazing. No bull about it.
This was the first thing I saw after getting home from work and that gave me a good laugh. Thanks Pope!

huge yakman
WHICH GAME IS THIS ?

    For Honor, this is only a meme right now though, it’s just a red kin of the Vanguard knight hero 
        PERFECT. THANKS !! 
This is why I love the Devs of for honor. We've come a long way boys and I'm proud we can enjoy ourselves and meme. Oh and thanks Mathieu for your awesome work on this sweet warden buff.
Mathieu, patron saint of bullshit. 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Nice try tin cans its a warden in a cow suit trying to fit in with the vikings
Master OX
Goes to show the talent is not the issue...
New goat simulator DLC?
Oh man, I leave this sub for a week or two and it immediately reaches peak memeage!  
Now I feel left out :(((
April 1st event boss confirmed?
Guess you could say Warden should Moooove over for Cowden. 

#CowdenfornewKnightHeavy 

But no seriously if you guys can do this why can you do for like crazy x amount of steel story-based skins? D: D: D: Do we need to pull a Smash Bros and say #FreeApollyon
It would be fucking incredible if they implemented an incredibly small chance of a player spawning as a cow/water buffalo. 
Now make it a cow level like diablo
Some people gave up on this game, me, I stayed because I knew the memes would come. I can die now.
Damn, looks like a One Piece character who ate some kind of buffalo devils fruit
This. This is why I'm willing to spend my money on in game cosmetics. I know I'm helping fund such magnificent work that is more tongue in cheek than lesbian butt porn. Seeing this has made my day. 
When the devs singlehandedly tinker with the game for a fanbase joke request. The absolute MOOTINY
I don't know what happened to For Honor after the beta...but now I'm interested

Cow outfits for april first, or we riot

#CowsOrRiot
OH. MY. FUCKING. GOD. THOSE. SOUND EFFECTS. THO.
This better be our Season 6 character
april fools update?
    It has to be. Remember the horrible "ice buffalo" mask or whatever they gave the Vikings? If they can't model a decent mask for an actual event, there's no way they're modelling a water buffalo just cause someone on Reddit asked for cows. 
You sirs have WON the Internet today!! Lmao!!!😩😂😩😂😩😂😩💀⚰️
I can't stop laughing for this cowden
Shutup and take my dang money, I need this on april fools.
Now we need dinosaurs and cows go against each other!
I don't see anything off with this 
What the fuck 
May our lord curse you for gracing this upon my eyesight

Ohh man, cant wait for 1st of April
Lawbringer= Elephant make it happen
Make this game mode permanent! ;) Nice combat, I like the cow's mooveset.

Seriously though, great job, Mathieu!!! The cuts on the cow are a nice touch.
Beautiful
and now, an advanced counter tactic to turtling: horsing
New character confirmed
PETA ain't gonna like this 
of course it's a warden.
wardens animal is a cow confirmed

I fucking love you guys
omfg
I would pay real actual money for this. 
holy hell, man!
I didn't know I needed this until now.  Throw in an Udder Rah and I'm sold (I was already sold, you had me at that first banjo string).
New Mythic skin looks good
I was expecting some kind of execution, not this. I still wasn’t disappointed though
In before it gets rule 4'ed
O my gawd...unbelievable xD and awesome!!!!
Please nerf

But seriously, that's amazing! Send our regards to Mathieu!
what the absolute fuck you absolute madmen
HOLY SHIT THIS IS AMAZING
I didn't know I needed this until I did
Sorry but this is wrong. Infernal bovines are Lawbringers. I’ve seen way too many of them in a certain secret level...
This is bullshit
This...this is why I love this dev team.
To the front page! 🐮
Now, let’s execute the cow?
Ok, now I need this in my life. 

"moo".
When I read cows I did not expect this. 
OH FUCK THAT CAUGHT ME OFFGUARD HOLY FUCK HAHAHAHHAHAHHAAHAHAHA
I guess we got the rework we asked for warden then?
new dlc hero is cool

Lol that emote. He also has fuctioning legs and a tail that reacts to movement. That makes me wonder, is this something they've been working on for more than a day...?
    Just some excellent skeletal rigging, I think. 

Some real top work, there. 
I'm not sure how to feel about this Warden rework. 
Benny Hill Approves.
We asked for a cow, and you give us a ***WATER BUFFALO?!***

Classic ubi, disappointing their fanbase yet again. 

^^^^/s

Jaw dropping
Damn...
Class

 Oh boy, April's Fool is gonna be a delight....
I'm kinda disappointed you didn't use warlords animations
Can we take it a step further and make the minions calfs? 
I think you should reskin a shugoki as a shinobi and a shinobi as a shugoki and just release that for April fools
Did... Did I get get drugged at some point???
This right here is why you guys are now my favorite devs. 
That double light at 0:48
I'm impressed Mr/Ms. Cow
Lmao it even gets cuts
Oh my god I can't stop laughing...the music....perfect....
Welp, GG boys. They went the way of /r/thanksboama.  We're done here.
good guy Mathieu 

nice work
This is by far the most Reddit thing I’ve ever seen.
Man, the holiday mask outfits really got a boost in quality
Im calling PETA
What if there were a 1 in 500 chance for one of the bots in a game to be a cow warden?
Excuse me what the hell. He was legit lmao
We will riot if this isn't a limiter time costume for aprils food.

#CowsOrRiot
i love this game so much :) Thank you devs!! 
I love you guys so much
Oh my god. Ubi gets bonus points in my book for this. 

U/MrEricPope We better see this in an event eventually! 
You know it should have been the law bringer instead. The Cow King wields a bardiche! All seriousness this is one of the best things I’ve ever seen, especially since I’m a massive fan of the secret cow level in diablo 2, and I can’t wait to see more. 
Holy shit
You absolute madman.
Wow. I can’t believe he delivered the way he did. Bravo 
New hero conformed: Mooarden.
God bless you Mr Pope


And the talented Dev team.
.....

............what.
What a time to be alive.
Swith version, when!? 

/s
cow mythic outfit wen

Ubisoft/Blizzard future crossover confirmed? 
.....
So we cant have Apollyon gear because of skeletons and things but we get a Cow? Alright.

(Also did NOT expect this when i saw your reply on the õriginal thread, absolutely marvelous)
Um...i thought it was in the actual game seeing as ive never played it. Got psyched and thought if i bought it i’d get to play as a bipedal bull thing rampaging thru crowds with a sword. 
yakety yak... don't come back.
The video won't work for me :(
RIP Daisy
If I see this tonight, I will literally cry
what the fuck am I watching.

Whoever made this, thank you.
Really Pope after all that we went through?
Lol. Anyone have a Youtube link for this? 
Wait what? What is this?
I'm not sure if I should be impressed or terrified!
I haven't played this game since a few weeks after launch.

I'm reinstalling.
new test your *moo*tal event confirmed?
This is not just a meme, nor a shitpost. This is a Pinnacle of human artistic talent and achievement.
Is this the new cow level?
New character confirmed?
I have no idea why you guys actually made this a thing but I love it
This should become an anime
This reminds me of the battle for Narnia....
This was amazing to watch and I don’t even know what’s happening. Would anyone mind giving me a quick overview of what just happened? Sorry I’m here from r/all 🤗
    Another person suggested putting cows in the game on another thread. The community manager said he would send the suggestion to the rest of the dev team, presumably as a joke, but here we are with this video.
    A user posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/82zqmu/ubisoft_can_you_put_a_cow_or_two_in_this_game/?utm_source=reddit-android) on the subreddit. The games head responded that "he would send the suggestion to the team" (it's the pinned comment on that post) and this is the results lol
Is this a tribute to Diablo Two?
Ok... That's pretty good.
Buffalo too OP  
Needs nerf... nerfalo 
What game is this originally?
Ok so THIS is sick.
What the fuck did I just watch 
Looks like Black and White!
There is no cow level
This is gonna be the next event mode, right?
I read the title as "I told you to send in the team" still thought it was fitting.
Holy fuck. Is this game like medieval total war but you’re one of the guys on the battlefield? Is the rest always all AI?

This game looks sick I want it 
    The game is primarily PvP focused but every multiplayer mode can be played in PvAI. The footage you're seeing here is of the mode Dominion, it's sort of like domination from CoD in that you capture and hold points. The unique gimmick is that the central lane has a horde of minions that fight to hold a line. If the line is your color, the lane is yours. You can slaughter enemy minions yourself to give your own minions an advantage. 
        Might get it then 
What game it's this
"How appropriate! You fight like a cow!"
What game is this
Imagine that was a real match, like you are playing as usual and suddenly you find yourself dueling a cow. I would die of laughter
    We went from fighting Tozen to fighting cows 
What is this game called? 
    Seriously?
if you take away the servers and add this I will totally understeand 
I've been lurking on the sub, wondering when to pick up the game (seeing if it would get the seige makeover). Guess I need to get it now... 
The secret cow level! There is a cow level!
Black and white for honor edition?
Tauren!
What game is this? 
I’ve never seen it before and it looks awesome. 
This is the best thing.
So far this is my favorite thing to happen on this sub. Hell, most subs
It's the Cow King from Diablo II 
I'm gonna have to call bull on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoGNKqfviCI
Lord please I want this as a event
When's the patch?
I spit out my fucking pizza from my mouth...
I like when he raises his sword up 
Holy bull balls!!!
I didn't realize this game still existed
Holy fucking shit.
That tail physics tho.
The enemy is incoming... let down the gate.
What.
Thicc
My sides...
"This is such bullshit." -Other team, probably
Is this that secret cow level I've heard so much about?
Eh it's ok but I don't think it has enough cowbell.
[He was just trying to go home](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HMFtTp-_DtM)
😂😂 I figured it out 
lol i can only imagine your reaction when you first saw the model
I’d like to believe that that is Highlander’s grunt modulated to sounds like a cows moo haha. 
This reminds me so much of the Secret Cow Level in Diablo 2....

I died and lost so much gold through that red portal 
what game is this
Is it possible we can get an event like this? ;)
Season 6 hero leaked
Also, if Easter and April Fools Day are on the same day...is the event gonna be a smash up of the two? Would we get Clown Bunny outfits with matching rabbit-eared masks? 
NOW I WANT SOME SORT OF BEAST WARRIOR FOR EACH FACTION 
/r/mypeopleneedme
I would actually buy the gane if this was a thing.
How did you do it looooool
Looks like Moo King from Diablo got the bigger buff.
I did not want to see the execution
Ubisoft is officially the best game dev working the market.
I was laughing too hard at this. 
The Dark Lord Chort has finally arrived!
I hate cows and their 50/50
Blood on swords next?! 
How much steel will this be and can it be for any character?
What is this game called?
    For Honor
I dont even... what.... just take my upvote
Well, now, I've seen everything.  Gj ! :D
what in the why the holy fucking im dyinhg
wardens... warriors of the ancient order 😂😂😂
I can't stop laughing for this cowden


I love you.
of course it has the warden who's humiliated ... first with all those executions and now this... 
The new cow class needs a buff
This the new warden buff?
peta is gonna be pissed as all hell lol
That's not a cow, that's a buffalo.
.........how in the actual name of wardens. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!?

And just how are we supposed to go on without this now?? FREE THE COW
Cow! Cow! Cow! Should be added into the game as well for april fools
*Bovine* Intervention
Animal Crossing: For Honor
Age of Cows: S6? 🤔^^🤔 ^🤔
Finally Warden rework!
Every time they kick the cow into fire all players nearby should gain a health boost.

The cow character needs to have an unblockable headbutt that deals high damage.

It should have a passive feat called "Seeing Red" where the lower it's health the higher the damage becomes.
A midget goes to the local butcher and asks “What special’s you got today?”

The butcher replies “Anything you can reach thats hanging from ceiling, you can have for free if your willing to accept the risks!”

The midget looks up, then looks back at the butcher and says...’

“I’d take you up on that offer, but the steaks are too high.”









“and your mother is a whore.”
Warden buff looks cool 
I want this, and other animals, in an event that just goes balls with realism. Have a fucking zoo fighting out there, I want it now. 
Just change the models and keep the animations. Let hilarity ensue.
Now let this magnificent creature claim the Volcamoo on her own !

This is pure gold. Thank you MrPope for pleasing our eyes with such beauty
I hate to be that guy but if he can make this in one night, new armor soon?
Looks like I chose the perfect time to come back to the community. 
So THAT'S the warden rework. He's a ... cow. Or whatever that is.
This is april fools material
Should’ve been shugoki because the charge with the horns
My internet has been out for the last 3 days because of storm quinn and this is what i come back to? fookin quality
New hero confirmed
And we wonder why the game is such in a bad state... full of anime and LGBT gay stuff, when even the moderators highly aproves and encourage this kind of shit posting...
    How the actual fuck is a cow one anime or two LGBT? Get a fucking grip.
Jokes and memes aside , for honor's animations and graphics are top notch. Thanks to mathieu and his team.
This gives me flashbacks of Diablo 2 cow runs....
Freaking love the devs <3
THE BEASTMEN HAVE COME, GET THE GUNPOWDER!
Sneak peak to new hero?
For Honor Vermintide -  Season 6 
wait what xD
This is the worst best thing to ever happen to this game.
Hm, but not-copy-pasted armors are completely impossible, right? -_-
That's just wasted productivity and time which I've heard they don't have much. 
    One guy worked on this, and he stayed late in the day to do it. It's just for fun man, lighten up.
        I just can't get their "brand new" armors as a "new" weekly content. 
If they can do something like this in one night with only one person. Then I'm sure that in at least one month they can do bunch of real new models. 
I know that they can do it, they proof it time and time again. And lack of new armors is just pure laziness. 
            I think you're making it a bit simpler then it sounds.

Everything they do has to be approved or assigned. New armor sets have to be designed. There are 18 heroes in the game. If you create a new armor set for one character, you have to do it for every character. That's 54 armor pieces that need to be designed.

I'm a graphic designer. I don't do this type of design, but if someone asked me to create 54 website designs in a month with my team I'd call them absolutely crazy.

However, these guys do manage to push out new armor sets at the beginning of each season. Sure, they're not the most unique sometimes, rather they're variations of other sets, but it's something. You have to remember that they likely do not have separate teams for outfits, ornaments, armor, weapons, etc. These devs are working machines if you think about all of the things they design. We get weekly content, some are good some are not. Effects, outfits, armor, weapons, ornaments. They have a lot of work to do.

They can't dedicate a month to making really unique armor sets because it'll sacrifice our weekly content. Personally, I'm okay with this, but I know why they won't do this. The only solution is to hire more people and if that were an option financially I'm sure they'd do exactly that.
                Where it comes to concepts then they have already plenty of them. 
And when it comes to complete models, there also have been a few unused ones. 
For example there are already at least 3 more variations of Orochi Oni armor as well as ateast one for Warden. 
All of the above were already shown to public and I'm sure there is more of them that we just don't know of. 

It's sad to see so many kids playing this game. I don't know what kind of full brain developed man would say this is even funny :)) But hey, meme-kids century :))
    THIS 👏 WAS 👏 MADE 👏 BY 👏 ADULTS 👏 AS 👏 A👏 JOKE 👏
We don't deserve them.
    This has me almost thinking about reinstalling uplay...
        Why do people hate UPlay so much? It's pretty common for companies to have their own launcher nowadays.

I start UPlay, I start For Honor, I close For Honor, I close UPlay, that's the only interaction that I have with it, why do people think that the launcher is literally Hitler?
            Let me start by saying the logo looks really dumb. Like someone designed this in 1998 and is to proud of it to let go. Also minor problems come up time to time rocking the 2 overlays.

But to be perfectly honest, it's less about the launcher and more about Ubisoft. It's kinda like EA and origin.

    I'd appreciate actual updates even more
        go away no fun person
            I'm really surprised by how many downvotes I have received. I didn't even say that Vultcano is stupid or anything.

    He earned it today; as opposed to when you bought the game? Who the fuck hasn't been paying /u/MrEricPope out of the game sell pot?

            I'm also thinking of trying it out now. I got it for free with a monitor purchase, but never tried it yet. Time to download :)
Now that is some good Dev-community relationship!
What the fuck!
Look at that Running Cow!
OMG!!!!We could make a meme for this!
The developers of this game are hilarious. This had me dying when he started to charge
I could go for one event day where all the different characters are a bull or some other animal.
    You mean like April fools?

Guild wars has done something like that every April fool's for the last 15 years ish.
        You mean Master OX?
    Sheep? And WOLVES? *trigger*
THERE IS A COW LEVEL AFTER ALL
    Moo!
    No no no, there is no cow level.

The loading screen says so.
I’m here from r/all and to be honest, that was my first reaction. Lmao, that’s pretty badass though. 
    They're just milking it for karma.
        I’m udderly disappointed.
            This is moosic to my steers. 
            Why didn’t you go with udderly ?

        That's a bull.  And that ain't milk...

                No real reason. There were donkeys added in the latest maps, maybe the guy was zonked and thinking about cows who knows
                    Wait really? That makes more sense now. Which new maps?

Can we get an event with velociraptor minions next? 
*slowclap*
You are a mad man
Year 2 knight confirmed 
Damn. You guys are the shit. Keep up the good work.
Needs more ponies.
Holy shit... This is amazing Hahaha 
Give metal gear orochi please or a very similar version of it. Could even make him a gundam. 
Just brilliant. Thank you 
You guys are just the best.
But no the one we need right now.
(*Heavily armored Knight leaves the bush*) "If it moos!" (*Ques burly Viking leaves another bush*) "Then its a cow!"

    I wish said characters the best of luck in milking this cow, then. Also, just realized I'm mistaken, it's an African or Cape Buffalo.
        Well we all know raider has that under control. We all know his motto doesn't mean nothing after all, you know "LEDGE, THEN DAIRY" I'm pretty sure he has that under control.
            I hope for his sake that the model isn't based on a male buffalo... I have a feeling he doesn't have the WIS score to be able to differentiate.
                Pfft..... if he can military press a Shugoki then he got this
No, it's a cebu
You're not wrong.
Boooo Roman!

Is their campaign and PVE modes?

They made new games /u/o0drwurm0o! Some of them are even objectively better than Diablo 2! You have a computer than can run any game on the market! Why go back to that 800x600 hell?!

One major change was that parries, be they light or heavy, no longer guarantee guardbreaks (no more parry-->instant death via ledges), you just get a light punish on h.parry and vice versa, though some things like Lawbringer's AD MORTEM l.parry punish remain due to the time window, as intended. Salvage can be used for xp boosts. Tribute exists, a new game mode. Conqueror & Kensei got their formidable reworks. ...and other neat things :3
They rebalanced a lot of stuff and have dedicated servers, so no more reason disconnects or poor connections ruining the fun. 
You are literally in the game's subreddit.

It's For Honor
Age of Cows: Sheep, Wolves, Cows ^^(And ^^donkeys ^^Ig) should become an official season! Or a seperate faction? Or 4v4 event?
No this is podracing
add a fucken cow in the game BUT not a Daubeny symbols...
For Honor, this is only a meme right now though, it’s just a red kin of the Vanguard knight hero 
    PERFECT. THANKS !! 
It has to be. Remember the horrible "ice buffalo" mask or whatever they gave the Vikings? If they can't model a decent mask for an actual event, there's no way they're modelling a water buffalo just cause someone on Reddit asked for cows. 
Just some excellent skeletal rigging, I think. 

Some real top work, there. 
Another person suggested putting cows in the game on another thread. The community manager said he would send the suggestion to the rest of the dev team, presumably as a joke, but here we are with this video.

    Eric and the other Ubi folks do not Moderate the subreddit. They can not remove posts/comments, ban users etc. They are 'Mods' because it allows them to sticky their posts and comments. 
        Technically correct is the best kind of correct ;)
            Just wanted to let folks know what they can and can not do :)
                Good mod

I just love these bots. I don't care if they are really bots or not

                Which is also a very good thing to do because them actually moderating would violate some reddit TOS iirc.
There are PVP, PVE (Bots), and a campaign
If this  is a diablo reference, god I wish 
    Stay awhile, and listen
        Bro, I said this in Cain’s voice. Ouch. Right in the feels. 
        Must... fight... the urge... to start a new D2 campaign...

They made new games /u/o0drwurm0o! Some of them are even objectively better than Diablo 2! You have a computer than can run any game on the market! Why go back to that 800x600 hell?!

every damn time. Probably because I'm British though. 
That video is older than vine was by like 6 or so years.
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!

Is what people spam in chat when they’re surprised by something. 
What a sad world we live in, friend.
That depends. Can you dupe me a kings sword of haste?

Lol 
PERFECT. THANKS !! 
Might get it then 
I just can't get their "brand new" armors as a "new" weekly content. 
If they can do something like this in one night with only one person. Then I'm sure that in at least one month they can do bunch of real new models. 
I know that they can do it, they proof it time and time again. And lack of new armors is just pure laziness. 
    I think you're making it a bit simpler then it sounds.

Everything they do has to be approved or assigned. New armor sets have to be designed. There are 18 heroes in the game. If you create a new armor set for one character, you have to do it for every character. That's 54 armor pieces that need to be designed.

I'm a graphic designer. I don't do this type of design, but if someone asked me to create 54 website designs in a month with my team I'd call them absolutely crazy.

However, these guys do manage to push out new armor sets at the beginning of each season. Sure, they're not the most unique sometimes, rather they're variations of other sets, but it's something. You have to remember that they likely do not have separate teams for outfits, ornaments, armor, weapons, etc. These devs are working machines if you think about all of the things they design. We get weekly content, some are good some are not. Effects, outfits, armor, weapons, ornaments. They have a lot of work to do.

They can't dedicate a month to making really unique armor sets because it'll sacrifice our weekly content. Personally, I'm okay with this, but I know why they won't do this. The only solution is to hire more people and if that were an option financially I'm sure they'd do exactly that.
        Where it comes to concepts then they have already plenty of them. 
And when it comes to complete models, there also have been a few unused ones. 
For example there are already at least 3 more variations of Orochi Oni armor as well as ateast one for Warden. 
All of the above were already shown to public and I'm sure there is more of them that we just don't know of. 

Why do people hate UPlay so much? It's pretty common for companies to have their own launcher nowadays.

I start UPlay, I start For Honor, I close For Honor, I close UPlay, that's the only interaction that I have with it, why do people think that the launcher is literally Hitler?
    Let me start by saying the logo looks really dumb. Like someone designed this in 1998 and is to proud of it to let go. Also minor problems come up time to time rocking the 2 overlays.

But to be perfectly honest, it's less about the launcher and more about Ubisoft. It's kinda like EA and origin.

go away no fun person
    I'm really surprised by how many downvotes I have received. I didn't even say that Vultcano is stupid or anything.

You mean Master OX?
I’m udderly disappointed.

    Thanks. I just don’t understand why the guy asked for a cow in the game. Something about donkeys?
        No real reason. There were donkeys added in the latest maps, maybe the guy was zonked and thinking about cows who knows
            Wait really? That makes more sense now. Which new maps? 
                Just the one, my bad, the marketplace one 
Well we all know raider has that under control. We all know his motto doesn't mean nothing after all, you know "LEDGE, THEN DAIRY" I'm pretty sure he has that under control.
    I hope for his sake that the model isn't based on a male buffalo... I have a feeling he doesn't have the WIS score to be able to differentiate.
        Pfft..... if he can military press a Shugoki then he got this
And his *D A T A*
