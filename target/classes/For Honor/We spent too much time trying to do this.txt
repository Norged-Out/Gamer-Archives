It's made better by Daubeny yelling, "What are you doing?!"
    Theres little funnier than when you're standing over your enemies dead body and Daubeny yells, "what are you doing? FIGHT!"

Uhm yeah OK Daubeny I'll beat the dead man. 
        Daubeny honestly gives me motive and incentive to win the duel. This is my favorite duel map just because of Daubeny.
            Daubeny is now officially For Honor‚Äôs best character.
                Just now? I was under the assumption he always was
                    He couldnt one-up Cross, not to mention living memes. Now, he did.
10/A+
oh wow, 

A) great job making this!

B) how did you make the swords drop?

C) hello r/all! 
    Oh geez, I just woke up.

A) Thanks!

B) There's currently a bug in custom games where you can make a Shugoki insta-kill someone (on no damage) and they'll force the opponent to drop their weapons but still live.

C) Whaat? I didn't even see that!
        What happens if you try to attack with no sword? 
            It looks like I'm pretending to use a sword.
                Oh god, I've gotta try that 
                I hate to bring up a month old post, but this would make for an excellent April Fools event.
                    Oh yeah, it would. Warden buffalo was awesome tho.
        I just checked top posts of all time for shits and gigs and here we are...
happy cakeday!
    Please don‚Äôt fix it!!
    In custom games if an enemy Shugoki (you can see three people in the game) is at critical health and hugs you, but you have damage turned off, you drop your sword.
        Sorry if I'm missing something here, but how can shugo be at critical health if damage is turned off?
            missing his demons embrace still does damage to himself
                Really?
                    Not anymore but 3years ago this was the case
                        OH this is an old clip I didn't realize that I know he used to lose health but I thought you meant he did only a little bit now
    Looks like the players have one up'd the devs. This seems like a challenge to the meme crown and I hope you guys rise to the occasion like a 4 feat Warlord. 
    wait I can't find it on r/all
    Shugo low health's demon embrace with damage turned off
time well spent and effort well put.

upvote and 10/10.

gg, no re
This better be on warriors den
    Raise your /u/MrEricPope
    With fucking >8 500 updoots, it will.
    Whenever we get something to appear or r/all, you know it is golden humor.
Time well spent, this is great! 
Fucking Brilliant. 
Worth it.
Ultra high effort post
hahaha I genuinely laughed out loud at this
How did you drop your swords???
    Well I know one of the methods of dropping your weapon is when you‚Äôre playing custom match with no damage modifier on. And you have what ever characters you want to play as, then you get another player to play as shugoki and then you have them use demons embrace until they have zero health. Then you have them demon embrace the player then he will grab them and break there back resulting in them still living but making them drop there weapon.

Edit: Spelling
        You can see that were three people in the game, so the two you see were on the same team, and their was an enemy a Shugoki who stood out of the shot, and hugged them to drop their weapons
This is amazing!
This is art
    No this is Patrick 
That was time well spent
Warden turned to drinking when he found out he wasn't getting a rework last week.
unfortunately, he's an angry drunk.
Dunmahhead
this is why we need two player emotes
Never played this game and that was amazing 

Can't imagine the time it took to get the timing just right

Unfortunately I only have but one upvote for you 
>What are you doing?!
Whoa, you guys are still around?  I feel like I haven't seen this sub on /r/all for like a year. 
    We're on /r/all? The For Honor subreddit was on the list of subreddits that couldn't get there, at least for a while. The game is healthier than ever.
        One the second page when I saw it. 
            Neato!
This belongs in the greatest of pedestals to be observed and praised by the entire world, well fokin done
Ending him sorta rightly
r/bettereveryloop
Runescape sure has changed since 2007
This is amazing and definitely worth the time
Gg
Incredibilis!
When the Viking convinces the chaste Chevalier to taste one of the "meads". Absofuckinglutely stone-cold hammered, those two. 
beautiful
This is probably my favorite post on this sub. Amazing 
Worth every second of your efforts. Amazing.
People looking in will not understand the amount of effort this took to make perfect.
  
"the armor guy threw the cup at the sexy leg boi and it hurt his head"
  
Well done
damn, that was pretty well done.  upvote for you
Andskotinn!
Now that's some sexy shit
Well done! üëè
I actually laughed at this
wow
Best thing I've seen all day
This is such an underrated post, take my upvote!
    *~5000 updoots in six hours in subreddit where 500 overall is very high*

>underrated
        I updooted when it was just 200 though :(
            Fair enough. What I guessed.

WAIT! I though I recognised you name when I originally commented! Just watched and commented on your video, and was rewatching few others. 1000 :D
                I'M FINALLY POPULAR :D

Thanks for the support! I'll keep making stuff while you guys keep watching it!
Masterfully done, Ol‚Äô Chap!!
Totally worth it though 
Amazing.

That should be an achievement 
Looks like there's 5 marines inside that dude's armor.

üëè 10/10 you guys are heroes for this. 
This is fucking brilliant
‚ÄúAw fuck, I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve done this.‚Äù 
I laughed a little more than I probably should have at this
    Why
        It was funny?...
            But why would you laugh more than you should? How can you actually do that and why ?
                You really need me to explain this?
                    Yes, I've read it a few times here and there and I always wanted to know why and how people would do that 
                        Ever* heard of the expression "it was funny, but it wasn't *that* funny"? 
                            Yes, funny enough to make you exhale quickly from your nose but not enough to make you giggle. 
                                That's the one
                                    Okay, I still don't see why you would laugh more than you should. Like, why did you continue laughing although as you said, it wasn't that funny
But can it ledge??
this is the quality content i come here for
Amazing!
Thats so fucking funny made my dey
Best thing I've seen on this sub! 
Fucking hilarious
Team emote!
Nailed it 
Priceless
Doing God's work.
Hahaha, great job guys
Wonderful!!
Perfection.
Damn well done hahaha 
beautiful
Where is highlander's sword btw?
    More than likely, they did shugoki insta-kill glitch in a custom game mode, that usually makes your weapon drop on the ground
Thank God you decided to stick with it
That's awesome. Well done sire
3rd player is a shugoki that they used to remove their weapons :D
whoaaaa :D
Thisis why I  love reddit XD
4th top post on the sub and climbing boys
This deserves to be gilded.
This is already 3rd place in top posts in r/forhonor lel
Take an upvote, well done
Daaaaamn
Deploy the upvotes
To get your character to drop his sword, turn off damage and have a shugoki do his one shot grab. 
:o LOL That is so beautiful
guud
I don‚Äôt even play For Honor, and I appreciate all the work that was put in for this. 
Holy shit we are on the front page. Great job!
What game is this?

Cracking a cold one with the boys be like.
First time I saw this, I thought it was a sentient animation.
Hello u/[Bilagaana\_Ashkii](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bilagaana_Ashkii)Very funny\^\^! Is it possible to use your videos in a compilation on our YouTube channel and on Pixel Heroes? I need your approval. We will credit you of course! Thank you and have a nice day! :\)

    Tons of people play the game. Hell, more than ever right now. I thought this meme died 6 months ago...
        What game is this?
            For Honor
                Thanks, looks nice
                    Very fun, hard to get into now (though new tutorials help).
                        RIGHT now is actually a great time, since there's so many new players after the free weekend. PC numbers haven't been this high since launch!
        I played Destiny (1, not 2), after it made a pretty good comeback. 

It never dies.

‚ÄúPeople still play this game?‚Äù Will always be around 
Nice Justiciar armour. $11/month well spent
    what
u/savevideo
worth every second it took to make this is hilarious
This is art
The fact the warden stays there carelessly while hl screams in agony makes it funnier
üíÄ
Take my upvote and leave
Nice
That highlander emote is gold, especially if your mourning over your dead teammate‚Äôs body lol
Nice job
Nice job
Holy shit , 4 years and still best post
Ok
