[[Double Standard Teammode Edition]]





Our point camper - - Their point camper
    I accept my role in this team.
        It is a critical role that should be taken seriously.
            Also Shuggo is slower than Bannerlord's update schedule so by the time I lurch off of a point and go to help someone they're already dead.
                as a rep 70 highlander i feel this.
                    Why is our Scottish boi so slow? If he can swing that giant sword as fast as he does, and hardly wears any armor, he should at least be as fast as raider.
                        why is warmonger faster with the same size weapon and more armor?
                            Because wolves are faster than sheep or... something.
                                You jest but its true I wake up in the morning and fresh smell of sheep to slaughter motivates me to get my ass in gear
                                But highlander's scottish not welsh!
                        I think it's because of how fast his lights are now. He clearly skips leg day and only focusses arms.
                            The Thighlander clearly doesn’t skip leg day. Maybe that’s actually the issue. Power lifts and squats all day. Dude could lift a truck but can’t run more than 100 meters. This is my head canon now.
                                Agreed! His thighs just smack and he can't keep from stumbling around on them. Hence the need for the open kilt too
                            He never skips leg day, his quads are huge! He is slow because they probably too heavy to run with haha.
                Same goes for Lawboi.
                    Ngl lawbringer is pretty fast, he can keep up with zerker
                        Yeah but i'm the one playing it and that doesn't help.
                            *gets stuck on pebble*
                I thought all character speeds were normalized a long time ago?

I haven't played since the new faction was added, so I wouldn't know.
                    Oh man you're *way* behind. On one side you're missing a ton of new and fun content, but at the same time you're also dodging a lot of bullets.  To answer your question, they are No way normalized
            It's mostly my team that complains they're always in a 3v4 with my ass sitting on the point
                So get off the point...
                    But it's so comfy... And as a Heavy I get my feats so fast there
                        Yeah but youre also about to eat a 1v4 after your mates died and they come for you next.
                            Anti-ganking powers, activate!
                                ZONE ATTACK ACTIVATE
                            Me corona blast when I camo a point .me: the more the merrier .the enemy : that’s your point you earned it
                    This why you always lose, because you can't hold an objective. Dominion isn't team deathmatch, the point is to gather points. Heavy's work best when holding an objective, because they are A. Doubling the score that the point gives and B. They're absolute units so they can hold off potential ganks on their home point if everyone else dies. L2play noob.

Edit - heavies are also slow, so do you really want them waddling from fight to fight and never getting there on time?
                        Not really, sure if you’re Shugoki you could maybe make a case, but near all Heavies are fast enough to rotate between points and ganks pretty effectively. 

Staying on one point boosting it while you’re team gets murdered because they’re in a 3v4 means that all the enemy team really has to do is hold minion lane and the other point and it doesn’t matter that you’re boosting the points, you’re going to break before them because they have one of the more important lanes in the fact of minion lane, and they have a point they can double up and heal from, while still having a numbers advantage against the team whose heavy is just sitting on a point. 

You essentially remove yourself from the game until your team is breaking. Staying on the point 80% of the time is not a good strategy if the enemy is even halfway decent.

                            Whatever you say buddy.
                                Definitely an "ok retard" moment.
                                    Agreed, I'm glad you're being introspective.
                                Looks like we got a tard bois!
                                    It's good to look inside yourself sometimes, good job buddy!
                            Thank you for this, retards still won't get it. I hope they keep getting ganked while standing on a point.
                                Spoken like a true tiandi main, good one Mohammed.

Also, Im not even the slightest bit surprised you're subscribed to a fuckin for honor rant subreddit. Jesus dude, let off some of that irl angst.
                                    I don't main anybody, i just enjoy or want to enjoy tiandi more.

I'm not even the slightest bit surprised you had to go through my profile, just to come up with a reply. Talk about letting of some of that irl angst. 
Go ahead, give it a try.
                        It's because of ppl like you I hate playing with randoms, also my BP would like to disagree about ur statement of heavies bieng slow....
                            I'm sorry I dont speak middle school, come again? Dont worry, you can say whatever you'd like, I know I have a higher win rate regardless. I dont have ADHD so I know how to hold a point.
                                Sure... I believe u definitely if u say so.
                        Why did you have to say noob dude now you just come of as some asshole, also if the midpoint isn’t too far away and you have a relatively fast heavy you can go for mid clears.
                        hehehe conq go *flail noises* hehehehe shield bash
                As a jorm main, I feel this.
                    Well met brother
                        I hate to be that girl but I'm not a boy lol
                            My apologies, all good. I had nothing to base off of so I went with brother.

Well met, sister
                                Yeah that's fair enough, I think most people assume everyone is male because mostly males play for honor, so I wont hold it against you, just figured I'd let you know. No hard feelings
                                    True that, although the number of gals I've met in this community keeps going up. Nice to see
        Camping points is a good thing, I will die on this hill.
            What fucks me is when two people are camping a point, leaving the other two players to either join in, meaning you lose all other points and the match, pretty quickly, or run around trying to cap the other two points and getting mercilessly gang banged for their efforts.
                I literally had a game two days ago with 3 people that were camping a point and repeatedly fed revenge to the enemy bp. Like I was fighting a 1v3 for several minutes in mid and the other point while they spent all their time ganking bp like complete braindeads. Not only that: All 3 would keep camping the point until bp arrives again so they can gank him for another two minutes. We lost with a score of something like 1200 to 300.
                    Those are the moments that make me rage quit smh, like the game isn’t even fun at that point.
                    I had a game exactly like this the other day on High Fort, I ended up just clearing B, getting ganked on B, and dying. And then letting my respawn timer tick all the way down before doing the same thing again. When we started breaking I sat at a ledge by spawn and waited for the enemy Warlord to charge me off. There's honestly no point in playing when you have dipshit teammates like that. They wouldn't even send a person off to clear B every now and again.
                    UUUUHHHH
                Or when an assassin stays on the point that I, as a heavy, am defending. Like fuck off this is my job, go shiv someone in the corner or something
                    Agreed I’m sitting on this point you can kindly fuck off and rotate back to gank as needed
                    Can confirm, my main goal during an avg match is to shiv someone in the corner, or something..
                Or how about the players who treat it is a death match and don’t take a single point.
                You only need one person on a dominion point for the bonus people really should realise this iam a bit fed up with two people camping at the point on there own side of the map
                This is fair but one dude hanging back to a single point has it's places. Especially against assassins.
                two people on two points called a team for a reason
            I’m mean if I’m playing a heavy I’ll camp a point you want me to have access to all my feats let me camp once I get my feats I’ll try and rotate to help you but first I want my feats early
On
            Boosting is fine but NOT AL FOKEN MATCH ;-;
                Say it louder for idiots at the back.
 I am tired of ppl saying they boost so they do there part and if u call them out on it they show the damn score board. Ugh
                    Ye most of the time they show the scoreboard and their score is 5 in 10 so even that argument from them sucks
                    Boosting al match is only acceptable when the other oponent is doing the same so its basicly a 3v3 but if its a 4v3 the odds of the 4guys.of winning is greater.
                Fair I guess but you need a guard.
                    uuuuuuu SHINEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
        Me: *Looks at your flair* *flashbacks to vietnam*
        I just wanna say i love your user flair
            Thank you! Been fixing back problems since launch.
    My friends a shugo main and does this. I call him the ogre of zone C.
    Ouch
    Someone’s gotta do it








It’s me, I gotta do it, zone ‘A’ is my home

Our situationally aware player - Their dishonorable ledge/spike user
    Fr tho imagine being honorable lol
        Indeed.

Being honorable can cost you the match. I like being honorable in elimination where 1v1 scenarios take place but in gank-reliant modes like dominion, breach or skirmish? Yeah..you can bet your ass Imma ledge ya!
            "What, I stood next to a cliff in this kill or be killed setting and you punished me for it? trash!"
        I don’t care about drop killing, but I hate Ledging
            Meh. Don't wanna be thrown off a ledge? Stay away from the ledge, idiot!
                If only it were that easy
                    Considering how many guard railings were added over the years, it's that easy, no?
                        You’re still next to ledges quite a lot. I’m also terrible at countering GBs, though I guess
    They made it harder to ledge tho :/
Was going for [this](https://kollincooley.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/ourglorioushomelandtomgauld_485976_1.jpg) idea basically:)
    Wonderfully executed
    You nailed it, dude. It's really hilarious
    Excellent execution. Before seeing your comment this comic was my first thought
    *backward savages*
Dodge attack enthusiast part got me
    *Phone call to Jolina and a Bye Bye YEET*
        Please dont soft feint zone into kick tiandi senpai, ish too faest
            Zone soft feint to kick canceled with dodge and then smack them with a light. Do it right and they still shout, but you also get to hit them at the same time.
Our: Smart player retreating to get a better chance
Their: Big pussy trying to run away like a bitch
    “COME AND FIGHT ME COWAR- oh shit there’s two of them now”
I wish it was like this - the solo queue experience is much more like "their 4 competent players" vs "me and our 3 random morons".
    You mean a moron and 3 other morons?
        Yeh that's about right :P
            Same
    Or my personal favorite: Their 4 actual human players and my 3 bot teammates.
    dunno about that one chief. as someone who exclusively solo queue for all my 500 ish hours i've been doing ok; it's more of a coin toss simulation.

sometimes i get an incredible team and we can coordinate ganks like no tomorrow.

not even sure how common are 4-stacks unless i see 4 identical emblems
    this was the reason why i put down the game for a while as a solo player, it was usually me and 3 randos who are barely keeping it together going against a team of 4 buddies who play this all the time.
Our good helpful teammate who helps us when we're about to lose a 1v1. Their fucking dishonorable trash little F-slur Double Teaming cunt.
    This is the one
    Honestly I’d rather have someone help me rather than just wait for me to die and get executed and then watch them die because they wanted honor but got ganked in the process
        Flip side, I absolute hate people who just spam R2 in a gank. Like, thanks bud just what he needed. Revenge. The average player has absolutely no clue how to gank.
            Also true I try to throw an occasional unblockable to help do damage but I’m not gonna just swing for the sake of swinging and feed revenge like it’s going out of style. If I have someone who does that and feeds the guy revenge I back off and let him take the fight since he was so eager to try and kill him he can fight him with the revenge that he fed
                I usually get unlucky and they'll get revenge and pop it as soon as i go to swing so im knocked down and take the full wrath of their hate boner.
                    Same I’ve had that too it’s always fun when it’s a highlander that gets revenge and I lose 80 percent or more of my health in less than 2 seconds
                I do the same thing, had a pk feed revenge and I just edge walked away to the corner and waited for the fight to be over. Needless to say I got hate mail from the pk
                    I don’t blame you. It’s always frustrating when a fight is going well and someone has to run over there and pretend to help only to just feed a truck load of revenge
                        Right, if they're only going to feed revenge I'd prefer to take the entire enemy team on one zone while my team just caps the other zones and boosts.
    Nailed it
I’m not too big to admit that I’m a fucking hypocrite on this game.
    I think we’re all hypocrites when it comes to this game
This is accurate
    Way too much
Our team- Loud intimidating warcries to instill fear into the heart of our enemies

Their team- WU NAI TIANDI
Never before have I been so offended by something that I 100% agree with.
    You know what, I AM too good for a free banana
As a warden, conq, orochi i can confirm this but for the tiandi it's the bitch ass that keep dodging and that aply for both team
    when ganking I like to just perpetually dodge around them without actually landing hits. It is the optimal ganking method
        And you look fabulous when doing it! That's the best part.
        it just make me want to fucking die
Any hero I die to is bad.
Man, high quality post. Covers the bases pretty well!
Too damn right
Our synergy, their ganking trash.
Our Gladiator: guy with a toe fetish
Their Gladiator: guy with a toe fetish
Our gank buster - their shitty toxic corruption user
As a Tiandi main, I am insulted that you imply that our true title, Obnoxious Ballerina, is some kind of insult!
Its really the no life part lmaooo cuz I aint even gonna lie I do it kinda frequent. If I'm good at a game and you somehow still BODY me you're some kind of fucking weirdo who never seen the light of day or some shit cuz how you body me like that lmaoo
5vs5 sounds great
Change the Orochi to "Our stupid lightspammer, their stupid lightspammer" and it'll be perfect. LOL I kid the orochi players. But no really it would be perfect.
WELCOME TO FOR HONOR! WE HAVE LOGHTSPAM, HYPERARMOR AND MORE ANNOYING GAME MECHANICS FOR JUST THE LOW PRICE OF YOUR COCK AND BALLS!
I wish more people played FH, this would be on the front of R/all if they did
Why is warlord's not:

Ultra survivalist-absolute coward
I'm the opposite of a turtle
    So you keep throwing lights and heavies non stop, even after they get blocked and parried, even after you run out of stamina you just keep throwing attacks, fuck defense, just keep pressing RB and RT no matter what. 

Because that’s what I feel like people want you to do when you parry two of their light attacks and they get mad and start calling you a turtle. They want you to be on offense 100% of the time, so *they* can parry or counter you over and over. Anything less than 100% offensive attacks is being a turtle in their eyes.
        Sad fact of playing a heavy if you play defensively at all because that’s what your kit literally is about you are just a piece of trash turtle who can’t play the game. I mean what the hell am I supposed to do?
            I play conqueror extremely offensively and tend to be 1st or 2nd in my team. I haven't really looked up strategies until now haha is he supposed to be played really defensively?
                He’s a heavy who specializes in baiting people to attack his shield and then punishing what they do. That doesn’t mean you have to play him defensively but it’s a viable strategy for sure that’s why he can feint into his all guard and has his counter attack from all guard and I think he still has superior block so it shuts down a lot of attacks
        Basically yeah except I parry 90% of everything
Our meme loving man that also good at the game -- Their toxic emote spammer
As a Tiandi: Can confirm both.
I think you got conqueror wrong it should be “good luck to console players”
    Can you explain this?
        Light spam
            Yeah but why does that translate to good luck to console players?
                As Xbone player I find Conq lights ez to parry so IDK
                    Weird haha I play Conq and my lights usually don't get parried that often
                        4 me there easy, not sure about others
>our swift and agile warrior

You fucking weeb ;)
I love this, it is so true, so many people are like this.
Yes (except my team calls me both ;-;)
Now this my friend, is a good meme

    Dude people do his dash heavy all day without using any mother move and think they are good.
        [removed]
            That's.... Because Highlander doesn't have any that work
This il brilliant, love it op
This is heavily how I feel about the Call of Duty community as well.
I have no double standards. We are all retards on this boat
People will be hypocritical in the heat of a match and not even realize
Obnoxious ballerina killed me off 😂😂
Our tank - their fucking 50/50
I admit only bash spamming if its a crusade and they are bots
And the shogoki would be the best helping boy, and on the enemie team ould be fat mothertrucker
Oh no I hate everyone on my team too
if you ever call an orochi player on your team a swift and agile player i cant trust you
You forgot your annoying teammate who is spamming heavy tops on the enemy you were just beating in 1v1, so your enemy gets revenge for kill you both 😄
    Nah, lights only, then runs away once they get revenge
" our coordinated teamwork based operation teams " "their deathstacks"
You fool! I hate my teammates just as much as the enemy.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

And I will make him go through ranked with early 219 PK
Spot on, that's exactly how I view things.
Sums it up.
All of these I think 4 both sides
so it is basically a mirror ?
I would swap warlord and conq. Although I don't find conq that annoying I find warlords turtle way more
    Cause warlord just looks dumb when he turtles .
Idec if I'm winning having to watch that rotund beaver looking pos have such an easy time cheesing all block into zone annoys me
        Warlord causes me pain
            Not gonna lie i kinda prefer defending conq light chains over warlord where all his animations just look the same so either you fail the parry on a light cause its really fast or you fail the parry on a heavy cause you predicted light. And so on

But at this point nothing is worse than wu lin animations where they look like some kind of stop motion anime
The council will decide your fate
Nice
But it's them wins the game
Such is way
Hey that's me, the top 3
What sorcery is this, where there is five players per team
Conq should be the spammer, warlord the turtle and orochi the rep 2 noob
Us- Wow! good fight!
Them- 


thanks!
Thanks!
Thanks!
Nah the Tiandi is ALWAYS a fucking annoying ballerina
Wrong. Everybody hates Tiandi
This is a great post and it is hilarious
Wow, this is so accurate it's scary! As in quite literally this morning!
Obnoxious ballerina no matter how you slice it lmao
i came here to laugh not be ATTACKED
And youll still lose lol
Orochi: *Our Swift and Agile hero" Reality slowest lights and heavies
People are shitheads
Proud tiandi main
“Them” always wins tho.
I'm thier
This is not the law of equivalent exchange papa Thanos is displeased
Nah man, I'm on the second side for everyone
Swear everyone claim they’re “us” we got some imposters among us
I mean shugoki is the only fat character and therefore the only character that should be a slow runner. You can be a big dude like raider or lawbringer and you’ll probably run as fast if not faster than pk or shinobi. Stride length considered. Maybe not lawbringer because while plate armor isn’t detrimental to your mobility it will affect it
Nah, I use the "them" adjectives to describe both sides actually.
Our ledge expert, THEIR toxic player.
Optimal wardens are soo rare. I'm usually pissed when i see someone pick warden in a dominion match, because there's only soo much that character can do, that player has to give 9/10 all the time if want a shot at winning. And whenever i find such a player in the opposite team, I'm scared shitless cause he probably has an answer to all my moves hahahah. Same goes with tiandi tho but tiandi can knock you the fuck off the map just for kicks. It's so much harder to be a dodge specialist when you get hit by all kinds of attacks during dodges.
Nah sorry can’t agree with that one... if my teammates are light spammers I still fucking hate them also I don’t really care about the other ones
Our Swift and Agile Warrior? Bruh I bully my Orochi friends harder than I bully enemy Orochi.
US, UK
As a Tiandi I can agree to this, I also spam when I am against another Tiandi
Unless you want to be light-spammed, ballerina is Tiandi's only good option.
Thang God I’m only a rep 30 Warlord
Thank God I main Lawbringer
YES
Yep makes sense
Gold
I see no problem here
"Dodge-Attack Enthusiast" until he bush
This brings back a lot if frustrating memories of LB in year 1.
Replace us and them with, me and everybody else when I'm fucking tired of this game and I hate it but still refuse to quit it.
Honestly if I ever see my teammate who is constantly being a cheeky bitch like any of these, and I see him get 5v1’d, I just let it happen
Not once have I said a positive thing abt characters in my team
I do sometimes get onto my teammates for playing unfairly/spamming. I want to play and have fun. Not just win.
    Playing unfair isn't a thing and spamming is not bad. If that's the way they wanna play then let them
I just complain about everyone even my teammates
I mean, I guess we can all agree that we called an enemy orochi like that at one point.
Yup. Sounds about right
I can't say that I'm there
Nah I hate orochi in particular.
Don't care who's team he is on. 
Same goes for Kensei.
Our incredibilis Centurion
Their infirmus Centurion
    indeed
The double standard for me would be “the friend who doesn’t play” often vs “no-skill shitter.”
You can say what you want.
It's so true
Now do it with shinobi
In not running away like a bitch, its a tactical retreat.

Me: “you dancy twinkle toe Chinese dradel , good fight though.”The duality of man.
And then we realize, they’re all the same, it’s just team based biases
I am in the samurai faction but that doesn't mean I defend light spamers I hate them.
I’ve never been this mad at something I 100% agree with
Our dumbass, their dumbass
70 rep is not veteren
    On a certain hero tho
        If it were all on the one hero than maybe I see it.
Anyone else PK need a big fat buff
    Hell nah leave that light spamming bleed bitch nerfed
        You just made me and 3 people mad
            Good cause yall probably spam bleeds like rep 1
I'm with us in everything except the lightspam part 
.fuck orochi
It's not a double standard if it's something being used for or against you. You're experiencing two variations of the same thing.

It's like saying Tails and Heads on a coin are double standards.

    Let me guess, you got ledged?
I figured shugoki that fat piece of hog would be here and that broken Piece of garbage Kendrick would be there too
    Wow your bad
        Consol kensei is absolutely broken
            I was mostly talking about Shugoki but i’d say Kensei’s not that bad either
                I didn’t say he was broken I called him a hog. Also kensei is the new broken character
                    Git gud
To be fair I've maybe seen 2 orchis in my time of playing that actually are skilled.
Yup
But if you play hito everybody hates you
So what about the average player who doesn’t get the time to forge a playstyle because their fighting five people at once?
True
This is true, and I will not see otherwise.
I’m a hate crime
Absolutely true.
Our team players - their stupid gankers
Turtle man wins
Our smart weapon choice expert, Their stupid meta op-character-using skill-less bitch
I main Medjay so I don't think I'm allowed to talk shit about any other players. Keeps me sane this way. Plus I really just gank all match.
I accept my role in this team.
    It is a critical role that should be taken seriously.
        Also Shuggo is slower than Bannerlord's update schedule so by the time I lurch off of a point and go to help someone they're already dead.
            as a rep 70 highlander i feel this.
                Why is our Scottish boi so slow? If he can swing that giant sword as fast as he does, and hardly wears any armor, he should at least be as fast as raider.
                    why is warmonger faster with the same size weapon and more armor?
                        Because wolves are faster than sheep or... something.
                            You jest but its true I wake up in the morning and fresh smell of sheep to slaughter motivates me to get my ass in gear
                            But highlander's scottish not welsh!
                    I think it's because of how fast his lights are now. He clearly skips leg day and only focusses arms.
                        The Thighlander clearly doesn’t skip leg day. Maybe that’s actually the issue. Power lifts and squats all day. Dude could lift a truck but can’t run more than 100 meters. This is my head canon now.
                            Agreed! His thighs just smack and he can't keep from stumbling around on them. Hence the need for the open kilt too
                        He never skips leg day, his quads are huge! He is slow because they probably too heavy to run with haha.
            Same goes for Lawboi.
                Ngl lawbringer is pretty fast, he can keep up with zerker
                    Yeah but i'm the one playing it and that doesn't help.
                        *gets stuck on pebble*
            I thought all character speeds were normalized a long time ago?

I haven't played since the new faction was added, so I wouldn't know.
                Oh man you're *way* behind. On one side you're missing a ton of new and fun content, but at the same time you're also dodging a lot of bullets.  To answer your question, they are No way normalized
        It's mostly my team that complains they're always in a 3v4 with my ass sitting on the point
            So get off the point...
                But it's so comfy... And as a Heavy I get my feats so fast there
                    Yeah but youre also about to eat a 1v4 after your mates died and they come for you next.
                        Anti-ganking powers, activate!

                        Me corona blast when I camo a point .me: the more the merrier .the enemy : that’s your point you earned it
                This why you always lose, because you can't hold an objective. Dominion isn't team deathmatch, the point is to gather points. Heavy's work best when holding an objective, because they are A. Doubling the score that the point gives and B. They're absolute units so they can hold off potential ganks on their home point if everyone else dies. L2play noob.

Edit - heavies are also slow, so do you really want them waddling from fight to fight and never getting there on time?
                    Not really, sure if you’re Shugoki you could maybe make a case, but near all Heavies are fast enough to rotate between points and ganks pretty effectively. 

Staying on one point boosting it while you’re team gets murdered because they’re in a 3v4 means that all the enemy team really has to do is hold minion lane and the other point and it doesn’t matter that you’re boosting the points, you’re going to break before them because they have one of the more important lanes in the fact of minion lane, and they have a point they can double up and heal from, while still having a numbers advantage against the team whose heavy is just sitting on a point. 

You essentially remove yourself from the game until your team is breaking. Staying on the point 80% of the time is not a good strategy if the enemy is even halfway decent.

                        Whatever you say buddy.
                            Definitely an "ok retard" moment.
                                Agreed, I'm glad you're being introspective.
                            Looks like we got a tard bois!
                                It's good to look inside yourself sometimes, good job buddy!
                        Thank you for this, retards still won't get it. I hope they keep getting ganked while standing on a point.
                            Spoken like a true tiandi main, good one Mohammed.

Also, Im not even the slightest bit surprised you're subscribed to a fuckin for honor rant subreddit. Jesus dude, let off some of that irl angst.
                                I don't main anybody, i just enjoy or want to enjoy tiandi more.

I'm not even the slightest bit surprised you had to go through my profile, just to come up with a reply. Talk about letting of some of that irl angst. 
Go ahead, give it a try.
                    It's because of ppl like you I hate playing with randoms, also my BP would like to disagree about ur statement of heavies bieng slow....
                        I'm sorry I dont speak middle school, come again? Dont worry, you can say whatever you'd like, I know I have a higher win rate regardless. I dont have ADHD so I know how to hold a point.
                            Sure... I believe u definitely if u say so.
                    Why did you have to say noob dude now you just come of as some asshole, also if the midpoint isn’t too far away and you have a relatively fast heavy you can go for mid clears.
                    hehehe conq go *flail noises* hehehehe shield bash
            As a jorm main, I feel this.
                Well met brother
                    I hate to be that girl but I'm not a boy lol
                        My apologies, all good. I had nothing to base off of so I went with brother.

Well met, sister
                            Yeah that's fair enough, I think most people assume everyone is male because mostly males play for honor, so I wont hold it against you, just figured I'd let you know. No hard feelings
                                True that, although the number of gals I've met in this community keeps going up. Nice to see
    Camping points is a good thing, I will die on this hill.
        What fucks me is when two people are camping a point, leaving the other two players to either join in, meaning you lose all other points and the match, pretty quickly, or run around trying to cap the other two points and getting mercilessly gang banged for their efforts.
            I literally had a game two days ago with 3 people that were camping a point and repeatedly fed revenge to the enemy bp. Like I was fighting a 1v3 for several minutes in mid and the other point while they spent all their time ganking bp like complete braindeads. Not only that: All 3 would keep camping the point until bp arrives again so they can gank him for another two minutes. We lost with a score of something like 1200 to 300.
                Those are the moments that make me rage quit smh, like the game isn’t even fun at that point.
                I had a game exactly like this the other day on High Fort, I ended up just clearing B, getting ganked on B, and dying. And then letting my respawn timer tick all the way down before doing the same thing again. When we started breaking I sat at a ledge by spawn and waited for the enemy Warlord to charge me off. There's honestly no point in playing when you have dipshit teammates like that. They wouldn't even send a person off to clear B every now and again.
                UUUUHHHH
            Or when an assassin stays on the point that I, as a heavy, am defending. Like fuck off this is my job, go shiv someone in the corner or something
                Agreed I’m sitting on this point you can kindly fuck off and rotate back to gank as needed
                Can confirm, my main goal during an avg match is to shiv someone in the corner, or something..
            Or how about the players who treat it is a death match and don’t take a single point.
            You only need one person on a dominion point for the bonus people really should realise this iam a bit fed up with two people camping at the point on there own side of the map
            This is fair but one dude hanging back to a single point has it's places. Especially against assassins.
            two people on two points called a team for a reason
        I’m mean if I’m playing a heavy I’ll camp a point you want me to have access to all my feats let me camp once I get my feats I’ll try and rotate to help you but first I want my feats early
On
        Boosting is fine but NOT AL FOKEN MATCH ;-;
            Say it louder for idiots at the back.
 I am tired of ppl saying they boost so they do there part and if u call them out on it they show the damn score board. Ugh
                Ye most of the time they show the scoreboard and their score is 5 in 10 so even that argument from them sucks
                Boosting al match is only acceptable when the other oponent is doing the same so its basicly a 3v3 but if its a 4v3 the odds of the 4guys.of winning is greater.
            Fair I guess but you need a guard.
                uuuuuuu SHINEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
    Me: *Looks at your flair* *flashbacks to vietnam*
    I just wanna say i love your user flair
        Thank you! Been fixing back problems since launch.
My friends a shugo main and does this. I call him the ogre of zone C.
Ouch
Someone’s gotta do it








It’s me, I gotta do it, zone ‘A’ is my home
I am the zone A Lawbringer
Z O N E  A  L A W B R I N G E R
I point camp with orochi
us Lawbringers take our role very seriously
Fr tho imagine being honorable lol
    Indeed.

Being honorable can cost you the match. I like being honorable in elimination where 1v1 scenarios take place but in gank-reliant modes like dominion, breach or skirmish? Yeah..you can bet your ass Imma ledge ya!
        "What, I stood next to a cliff in this kill or be killed setting and you punished me for it? trash!"
    I don’t care about drop killing, but I hate Ledging
        Meh. Don't wanna be thrown off a ledge? Stay away from the ledge, idiot!
            If only it were that easy
                Considering how many guard railings were added over the years, it's that easy, no?
                    You’re still next to ledges quite a lot. I’m also terrible at countering GBs, though I guess
They made it harder to ledge tho :/
Wonderfully executed
You nailed it, dude. It's really hilarious
Excellent execution. Before seeing your comment this comic was my first thought
*backward savages*
*Phone call to Jolina and a Bye Bye YEET*
    Please dont soft feint zone into kick tiandi senpai, ish too faest
        Zone soft feint to kick canceled with dodge and then smack them with a light. Do it right and they still shout, but you also get to hit them at the same time.
“COME AND FIGHT ME COWAR- oh shit there’s two of them now”
You mean a moron and 3 other morons?
    Yeh that's about right :P
        Same
Or my personal favorite: Their 4 actual human players and my 3 bot teammates.
dunno about that one chief. as someone who exclusively solo queue for all my 500 ish hours i've been doing ok; it's more of a coin toss simulation.

sometimes i get an incredible team and we can coordinate ganks like no tomorrow.

not even sure how common are 4-stacks unless i see 4 identical emblems
this was the reason why i put down the game for a while as a solo player, it was usually me and 3 randos who are barely keeping it together going against a team of 4 buddies who play this all the time.
This is the one
Honestly I’d rather have someone help me rather than just wait for me to die and get executed and then watch them die because they wanted honor but got ganked in the process
    Flip side, I absolute hate people who just spam R2 in a gank. Like, thanks bud just what he needed. Revenge. The average player has absolutely no clue how to gank.
        Also true I try to throw an occasional unblockable to help do damage but I’m not gonna just swing for the sake of swinging and feed revenge like it’s going out of style. If I have someone who does that and feeds the guy revenge I back off and let him take the fight since he was so eager to try and kill him he can fight him with the revenge that he fed
            I usually get unlucky and they'll get revenge and pop it as soon as i go to swing so im knocked down and take the full wrath of their hate boner.
                Same I’ve had that too it’s always fun when it’s a highlander that gets revenge and I lose 80 percent or more of my health in less than 2 seconds
            I do the same thing, had a pk feed revenge and I just edge walked away to the corner and waited for the fight to be over. Needless to say I got hate mail from the pk
                I don’t blame you. It’s always frustrating when a fight is going well and someone has to run over there and pretend to help only to just feed a truck load of revenge
                    Right, if they're only going to feed revenge I'd prefer to take the entire enemy team on one zone while my team just caps the other zones and boosts.
Nailed it
I think we’re all hypocrites when it comes to this game
Way too much
You know what, I AM too good for a free banana
when ganking I like to just perpetually dodge around them without actually landing hits. It is the optimal ganking method
    And you look fabulous when doing it! That's the best part.
    it just make me want to fucking die
So you keep throwing lights and heavies non stop, even after they get blocked and parried, even after you run out of stamina you just keep throwing attacks, fuck defense, just keep pressing RB and RT no matter what. 

Because that’s what I feel like people want you to do when you parry two of their light attacks and they get mad and start calling you a turtle. They want you to be on offense 100% of the time, so *they* can parry or counter you over and over. Anything less than 100% offensive attacks is being a turtle in their eyes.
    Sad fact of playing a heavy if you play defensively at all because that’s what your kit literally is about you are just a piece of trash turtle who can’t play the game. I mean what the hell am I supposed to do?
        I play conqueror extremely offensively and tend to be 1st or 2nd in my team. I haven't really looked up strategies until now haha is he supposed to be played really defensively?
            He’s a heavy who specializes in baiting people to attack his shield and then punishing what they do. That doesn’t mean you have to play him defensively but it’s a viable strategy for sure that’s why he can feint into his all guard and has his counter attack from all guard and I think he still has superior block so it shuts down a lot of attacks
    Basically yeah except I parry 90% of everything
Can you explain this?
    Light spam
        Yeah but why does that translate to good luck to console players?
            As Xbone player I find Conq lights ez to parry so IDK
                Weird haha I play Conq and my lights usually don't get parried that often
                    4 me there easy, not sure about others
Dude people do his dash heavy all day without using any mother move and think they are good.
    [removed]
        That's.... Because Highlander doesn't have any that work
Nah, lights only, then runs away once they get revenge

I noticed you dropped 3 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

Cause warlord just looks dumb when he turtles .
Idec if I'm winning having to watch that rotund beaver looking pos have such an easy time cheesing all block into zone annoys me
    Warlord causes me pain
        Not gonna lie i kinda prefer defending conq light chains over warlord where all his animations just look the same so either you fail the parry on a light cause its really fast or you fail the parry on a heavy cause you predicted light. And so on

But at this point nothing is worse than wu lin animations where they look like some kind of stop motion anime
Playing unfair isn't a thing and spamming is not bad. If that's the way they wanna play then let them
indeed
On a certain hero tho
    If it were all on the one hero than maybe I see it.

                    I'm sorry I dont speak middle school, come again? Dont worry, you can say whatever you'd like, I know I have a higher win rate regardless. I dont have ADHD so I know how to hold a point.
                        Sure... I believe u definitely if u say so.
                Why did you have to say noob dude now you just come of as some asshole, also if the midpoint isn’t too far away and you have a relatively fast heavy you can go for mid clears.
                hehehe conq go *flail noises* hehehehe shield bash
        As a jorm main, I feel this.
            Well met brother
                I hate to be that girl but I'm not a boy lol
                    My apologies, all good. I had nothing to base off of so I went with brother.

Well met, sister
                        Yeah that's fair enough, I think most people assume everyone is male because mostly males play for honor, so I wont hold it against you, just figured I'd let you know. No hard feelings
                            True that, although the number of gals I've met in this community keeps going up. Nice to see
Camping points is a good thing, I will die on this hill.
    What fucks me is when two people are camping a point, leaving the other two players to either join in, meaning you lose all other points and the match, pretty quickly, or run around trying to cap the other two points and getting mercilessly gang banged for their efforts.
        I literally had a game two days ago with 3 people that were camping a point and repeatedly fed revenge to the enemy bp. Like I was fighting a 1v3 for several minutes in mid and the other point while they spent all their time ganking bp like complete braindeads. Not only that: All 3 would keep camping the point until bp arrives again so they can gank him for another two minutes. We lost with a score of something like 1200 to 300.
            Those are the moments that make me rage quit smh, like the game isn’t even fun at that point.
            I had a game exactly like this the other day on High Fort, I ended up just clearing B, getting ganked on B, and dying. And then letting my respawn timer tick all the way down before doing the same thing again. When we started breaking I sat at a ledge by spawn and waited for the enemy Warlord to charge me off. There's honestly no point in playing when you have dipshit teammates like that. They wouldn't even send a person off to clear B every now and again.
            UUUUHHHH
        Or when an assassin stays on the point that I, as a heavy, am defending. Like fuck off this is my job, go shiv someone in the corner or something
            Agreed I’m sitting on this point you can kindly fuck off and rotate back to gank as needed
            Can confirm, my main goal during an avg match is to shiv someone in the corner, or something..
        Or how about the players who treat it is a death match and don’t take a single point.
        You only need one person on a dominion point for the bonus people really should realise this iam a bit fed up with two people camping at the point on there own side of the map
        This is fair but one dude hanging back to a single point has it's places. Especially against assassins.
        two people on two points called a team for a reason
    I’m mean if I’m playing a heavy I’ll camp a point you want me to have access to all my feats let me camp once I get my feats I’ll try and rotate to help you but first I want my feats early

    Boosting is fine but NOT AL FOKEN MATCH ;-;
        Say it louder for idiots at the back.
 I am tired of ppl saying they boost so they do there part and if u call them out on it they show the damn score board. Ugh
            Ye most of the time they show the scoreboard and their score is 5 in 10 so even that argument from them sucks
            Boosting al match is only acceptable when the other oponent is doing the same so its basicly a 3v3 but if its a 4v3 the odds of the 4guys.of winning is greater.
        Fair I guess but you need a guard.
            uuuuuuu SHINEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Me: *Looks at your flair* *flashbacks to vietnam*
I just wanna say i love your user flair
    Thank you! Been fixing back problems since launch.
Indeed.

Being honorable can cost you the match. I like being honorable in elimination where 1v1 scenarios take place but in gank-reliant modes like dominion, breach or skirmish? Yeah..you can bet your ass Imma ledge ya!
    "What, I stood next to a cliff in this kill or be killed setting and you punished me for it? trash!"
I don’t care about drop killing, but I hate Ledging
    Meh. Don't wanna be thrown off a ledge? Stay away from the ledge, idiot!
        If only it were that easy
            Considering how many guard railings were added over the years, it's that easy, no?
                You’re still next to ledges quite a lot. I’m also terrible at countering GBs, though I guess
Please dont soft feint zone into kick tiandi senpai, ish too faest
    Zone soft feint to kick canceled with dodge and then smack them with a light. Do it right and they still shout, but you also get to hit them at the same time.
Yeh that's about right :P
    Same
Flip side, I absolute hate people who just spam R2 in a gank. Like, thanks bud just what he needed. Revenge. The average player has absolutely no clue how to gank.
    Also true I try to throw an occasional unblockable to help do damage but I’m not gonna just swing for the sake of swinging and feed revenge like it’s going out of style. If I have someone who does that and feeds the guy revenge I back off and let him take the fight since he was so eager to try and kill him he can fight him with the revenge that he fed
        I usually get unlucky and they'll get revenge and pop it as soon as i go to swing so im knocked down and take the full wrath of their hate boner.
            Same I’ve had that too it’s always fun when it’s a highlander that gets revenge and I lose 80 percent or more of my health in less than 2 seconds
        I do the same thing, had a pk feed revenge and I just edge walked away to the corner and waited for the fight to be over. Needless to say I got hate mail from the pk
            I don’t blame you. It’s always frustrating when a fight is going well and someone has to run over there and pretend to help only to just feed a truck load of revenge
                Right, if they're only going to feed revenge I'd prefer to take the entire enemy team on one zone while my team just caps the other zones and boosts.
And you look fabulous when doing it! That's the best part.
it just make me want to fucking die
Sad fact of playing a heavy if you play defensively at all because that’s what your kit literally is about you are just a piece of trash turtle who can’t play the game. I mean what the hell am I supposed to do?
    I play conqueror extremely offensively and tend to be 1st or 2nd in my team. I haven't really looked up strategies until now haha is he supposed to be played really defensively?
        He’s a heavy who specializes in baiting people to attack his shield and then punishing what they do. That doesn’t mean you have to play him defensively but it’s a viable strategy for sure that’s why he can feint into his all guard and has his counter attack from all guard and I think he still has superior block so it shuts down a lot of attacks
Basically yeah except I parry 90% of everything
Light spam
    Yeah but why does that translate to good luck to console players?
        As Xbone player I find Conq lights ez to parry so IDK
            Weird haha I play Conq and my lights usually don't get parried that often
                4 me there easy, not sure about others

Warlord causes me pain
    Not gonna lie i kinda prefer defending conq light chains over warlord where all his animations just look the same so either you fail the parry on a light cause its really fast or you fail the parry on a heavy cause you predicted light. And so on

But at this point nothing is worse than wu lin animations where they look like some kind of stop motion anime
If it were all on the one hero than maybe I see it.
You just made me and 3 people mad
    Good cause yall probably spam bleeds like rep 1
Consol kensei is absolutely broken
    I was mostly talking about Shugoki but i’d say Kensei’s not that bad either
        I didn’t say he was broken I called him a hog. Also kensei is the new broken character
            Git gud
Also Shuggo is slower than Bannerlord's update schedule so by the time I lurch off of a point and go to help someone they're already dead.
    as a rep 70 highlander i feel this.
        Why is our Scottish boi so slow? If he can swing that giant sword as fast as he does, and hardly wears any armor, he should at least be as fast as raider.
            why is warmonger faster with the same size weapon and more armor?
                Because wolves are faster than sheep or... something.
                    You jest but its true I wake up in the morning and fresh smell of sheep to slaughter motivates me to get my ass in gear
                    But highlander's scottish not welsh!
            I think it's because of how fast his lights are now. He clearly skips leg day and only focusses arms.
                The Thighlander clearly doesn’t skip leg day. Maybe that’s actually the issue. Power lifts and squats all day. Dude could lift a truck but can’t run more than 100 meters. This is my head canon now.
                    Agreed! His thighs just smack and he can't keep from stumbling around on them. Hence the need for the open kilt too
                He never skips leg day, his quads are huge! He is slow because they probably too heavy to run with haha.
    Same goes for Lawboi.
        Ngl lawbringer is pretty fast, he can keep up with zerker
            Yeah but i'm the one playing it and that doesn't help.
                *gets stuck on pebble*
    I thought all character speeds were normalized a long time ago?

I haven't played since the new faction was added, so I wouldn't know.
        Oh man you're *way* behind. On one side you're missing a ton of new and fun content, but at the same time you're also dodging a lot of bullets.  To answer your question, they are No way normalized
It's mostly my team that complains they're always in a 3v4 with my ass sitting on the point
    So get off the point...
        But it's so comfy... And as a Heavy I get my feats so fast there
            Yeah but youre also about to eat a 1v4 after your mates died and they come for you next.
                Anti-ganking powers, activate!
                    ZONE ATTACK ACTIVATE
                Me corona blast when I camo a point .me: the more the merrier .the enemy : that’s your point you earned it
        This why you always lose, because you can't hold an objective. Dominion isn't team deathmatch, the point is to gather points. Heavy's work best when holding an objective, because they are A. Doubling the score that the point gives and B. They're absolute units so they can hold off potential ganks on their home point if everyone else dies. L2play noob.

Edit - heavies are also slow, so do you really want them waddling from fight to fight and never getting there on time?
            Not really, sure if you’re Shugoki you could maybe make a case, but near all Heavies are fast enough to rotate between points and ganks pretty effectively. 

Staying on one point boosting it while you’re team gets murdered because they’re in a 3v4 means that all the enemy team really has to do is hold minion lane and the other point and it doesn’t matter that you’re boosting the points, you’re going to break before them because they have one of the more important lanes in the fact of minion lane, and they have a point they can double up and heal from, while still having a numbers advantage against the team whose heavy is just sitting on a point. 

You essentially remove yourself from the game until your team is breaking. Staying on the point 80% of the time is not a good strategy if the enemy is even halfway decent.

                Whatever you say buddy.
                    Definitely an "ok retard" moment.
                        Agreed, I'm glad you're being introspective.
                    Looks like we got a tard bois!
                        It's good to look inside yourself sometimes, good job buddy!
                Thank you for this, retards still won't get it. I hope they keep getting ganked while standing on a point.
                    Spoken like a true tiandi main, good one Mohammed.

Also, Im not even the slightest bit surprised you're subscribed to a fuckin for honor rant subreddit. Jesus dude, let off some of that irl angst.
                        I don't main anybody, i just enjoy or want to enjoy tiandi more.

I'm not even the slightest bit surprised you had to go through my profile, just to come up with a reply. Talk about letting of some of that irl angst. 
Go ahead, give it a try.
            It's because of ppl like you I hate playing with randoms, also my BP would like to disagree about ur statement of heavies bieng slow....
                I'm sorry I dont speak middle school, come again? Dont worry, you can say whatever you'd like, I know I have a higher win rate regardless. I dont have ADHD so I know how to hold a point.
                    Sure... I believe u definitely if u say so.
            Why did you have to say noob dude now you just come of as some asshole, also if the midpoint isn’t too far away and you have a relatively fast heavy you can go for mid clears.
            hehehe conq go *flail noises* hehehehe shield bash
    As a jorm main, I feel this.

Well met, sister
                Yeah that's fair enough, I think most people assume everyone is male because mostly males play for honor, so I wont hold it against you, just figured I'd let you know. No hard feelings
                    True that, although the number of gals I've met in this community keeps going up. Nice to see
I literally had a game two days ago with 3 people that were camping a point and repeatedly fed revenge to the enemy bp. Like I was fighting a 1v3 for several minutes in mid and the other point while they spent all their time ganking bp like complete braindeads. Not only that: All 3 would keep camping the point until bp arrives again so they can gank him for another two minutes. We lost with a score of something like 1200 to 300.
    Those are the moments that make me rage quit smh, like the game isn’t even fun at that point.
    I had a game exactly like this the other day on High Fort, I ended up just clearing B, getting ganked on B, and dying. And then letting my respawn timer tick all the way down before doing the same thing again. When we started breaking I sat at a ledge by spawn and waited for the enemy Warlord to charge me off. There's honestly no point in playing when you have dipshit teammates like that. They wouldn't even send a person off to clear B every now and again.
    UUUUHHHH
Or when an assassin stays on the point that I, as a heavy, am defending. Like fuck off this is my job, go shiv someone in the corner or something
    Agreed I’m sitting on this point you can kindly fuck off and rotate back to gank as needed
    Can confirm, my main goal during an avg match is to shiv someone in the corner, or something..
Or how about the players who treat it is a death match and don’t take a single point.
You only need one person on a dominion point for the bonus people really should realise this iam a bit fed up with two people camping at the point on there own side of the map
This is fair but one dude hanging back to a single point has it's places. Especially against assassins.
two people on two points called a team for a reason
Say it louder for idiots at the back.
 I am tired of ppl saying they boost so they do there part and if u call them out on it they show the damn score board. Ugh
    Ye most of the time they show the scoreboard and their score is 5 in 10 so even that argument from them sucks
    Boosting al match is only acceptable when the other oponent is doing the same so its basicly a 3v3 but if its a 4v3 the odds of the 4guys.of winning is greater.
Fair I guess but you need a guard.
    uuuuuuu SHINEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
If only it were that easy
    Considering how many guard railings were added over the years, it's that easy, no?
        You’re still next to ledges quite a lot. I’m also terrible at countering GBs, though I guess
I usually get unlucky and they'll get revenge and pop it as soon as i go to swing so im knocked down and take the full wrath of their hate boner.
    Same I’ve had that too it’s always fun when it’s a highlander that gets revenge and I lose 80 percent or more of my health in less than 2 seconds
I do the same thing, had a pk feed revenge and I just edge walked away to the corner and waited for the fight to be over. Needless to say I got hate mail from the pk
    I don’t blame you. It’s always frustrating when a fight is going well and someone has to run over there and pretend to help only to just feed a truck load of revenge
        Right, if they're only going to feed revenge I'd prefer to take the entire enemy team on one zone while my team just caps the other zones and boosts.
He’s a heavy who specializes in baiting people to attack his shield and then punishing what they do. That doesn’t mean you have to play him defensively but it’s a viable strategy for sure that’s why he can feint into his all guard and has his counter attack from all guard and I think he still has superior block so it shuts down a lot of attacks
As Xbone player I find Conq lights ez to parry so IDK
    Weird haha I play Conq and my lights usually don't get parried that often
        4 me there easy, not sure about others
I didn’t say he was broken I called him a hog. Also kensei is the new broken character
    Git gud
Why is our Scottish boi so slow? If he can swing that giant sword as fast as he does, and hardly wears any armor, he should at least be as fast as raider.
    why is warmonger faster with the same size weapon and more armor?
        Because wolves are faster than sheep or... something.
            You jest but its true I wake up in the morning and fresh smell of sheep to slaughter motivates me to get my ass in gear
            But highlander's scottish not welsh!
    I think it's because of how fast his lights are now. He clearly skips leg day and only focusses arms.
        The Thighlander clearly doesn’t skip leg day. Maybe that’s actually the issue. Power lifts and squats all day. Dude could lift a truck but can’t run more than 100 meters. This is my head canon now.
            Agreed! His thighs just smack and he can't keep from stumbling around on them. Hence the need for the open kilt too
        He never skips leg day, his quads are huge! He is slow because they probably too heavy to run with haha.
Ngl lawbringer is pretty fast, he can keep up with zerker
    Yeah but i'm the one playing it and that doesn't help.
        *gets stuck on pebble*
Oh man you're *way* behind. On one side you're missing a ton of new and fun content, but at the same time you're also dodging a lot of bullets.  To answer your question, they are No way normalized
But it's so comfy... And as a Heavy I get my feats so fast there
    Yeah but youre also about to eat a 1v4 after your mates died and they come for you next.

        Me corona blast when I camo a point .me: the more the merrier .the enemy : that’s your point you earned it
This why you always lose, because you can't hold an objective. Dominion isn't team deathmatch, the point is to gather points. Heavy's work best when holding an objective, because they are A. Doubling the score that the point gives and B. They're absolute units so they can hold off potential ganks on their home point if everyone else dies. L2play noob.

Edit - heavies are also slow, so do you really want them waddling from fight to fight and never getting there on time?
    Not really, sure if you’re Shugoki you could maybe make a case, but near all Heavies are fast enough to rotate between points and ganks pretty effectively. 

Staying on one point boosting it while you’re team gets murdered because they’re in a 3v4 means that all the enemy team really has to do is hold minion lane and the other point and it doesn’t matter that you’re boosting the points, you’re going to break before them because they have one of the more important lanes in the fact of minion lane, and they have a point they can double up and heal from, while still having a numbers advantage against the team whose heavy is just sitting on a point. 

You essentially remove yourself from the game until your team is breaking. Staying on the point 80% of the time is not a good strategy if the enemy is even halfway decent.

        Whatever you say buddy.
            Definitely an "ok retard" moment.
                Agreed, I'm glad you're being introspective.
            Looks like we got a tard bois!
                It's good to look inside yourself sometimes, good job buddy!
        Thank you for this, retards still won't get it. I hope they keep getting ganked while standing on a point.
            Spoken like a true tiandi main, good one Mohammed.

Also, Im not even the slightest bit surprised you're subscribed to a fuckin for honor rant subreddit. Jesus dude, let off some of that irl angst.
                I don't main anybody, i just enjoy or want to enjoy tiandi more.

I'm not even the slightest bit surprised you had to go through my profile, just to come up with a reply. Talk about letting of some of that irl angst. 
Go ahead, give it a try.
    It's because of ppl like you I hate playing with randoms, also my BP would like to disagree about ur statement of heavies bieng slow....
        I'm sorry I dont speak middle school, come again? Dont worry, you can say whatever you'd like, I know I have a higher win rate regardless. I dont have ADHD so I know how to hold a point.
            Sure... I believe u definitely if u say so.
    Why did you have to say noob dude now you just come of as some asshole, also if the midpoint isn’t too far away and you have a relatively fast heavy you can go for mid clears.
    hehehe conq go *flail noises* hehehehe shield bash
