[[Why the hype Please no spoilers.]]


So, I've had Portal on my Xbox 360/Xbox One for years now and played a bit. It's a decently enjoyable puzzle game, but I see it showered with praise that I don't understand. I'm genuinely curious, from those that give it that praise, why? I do want to play it through one day, just haven't found the motivation. I don't think it's bad, it just hasn't hooked me.


Portal 2 is the true instant classic, but the first one is still great. Though it depends if you like puzzle rooms, since that's the fundamental gameplay loop.

Aside from that, the story is very fun to uncover, especially since the Portal games as well as the Half-Life games are a masterclass of environmental storytelling.
    Also some good humor
    I think for many of us, how we were introduced helped too. The orange box had so much good shit we were waiting for and then this little puzzle game blew our minds.
The first Portal game is good, but it's basically a glorified tech demo. It gets more interesting towards the end of the game. I definitely recommend playing it. The whole thing is only a few hours long.

Portal 2 is the game that gets most of the praise. Puzzles introduce more interesting elements, there's new characters, actual story, and the humour is just so well written. Plus it's about 8 hours long, so it's much more of a full game experience.

        The average length of a playthrough is 8 hours. That's from player data submitted to howlongtobeat.com
        No one is completing portal 2 in 3-4 hours in their first playthrough without looking up solutions.
            I did (I had just finished portal 1 and immediately got into portal 2)
                Oh shit we have Chell herself in the chat.
                    No we just got someone who did coop with a friend before the single player mode
        yeah it takes 3 hours if your a good speedrunner lmao  
what are you waffling on about its a game with 9 chapters of content
        My first play through probably took me over 4 hours total
Play the entire game. It’s not very long, I usually beat it in under 2 hours now, I’d say it probably takes ~3-4 on a first playthrough.
    more like 4 - 5 tbh
    Which one
        Both. Both is good.
            Yes but one is significantly longer
I know you said no spoilers but there's portals
    I trusted you, brother.
cuz uhh glados

glados is cool
    You're cool!
Portal 1 is a tech demo with a fun concept. That’s not a jab at it. It was literally just bonus content originally. Throughout it, there are some hints at a larger story, and said hints come to a climax at the end - but it’s nothing massive. Portal 2, on the other hand, was made as it’s own game - *that’s* where it gets *really* good.
Why don’t you finish the game
    Right? It's 4 hours long so if OP played it "a bit" as they say, they played it for possibly 20 minutes.
        I had a similar reaction the first time I played “Bioshock”. I complained it seemed like all you did is what this other dude was telling you and then I got it.
            Lol the classic case of mindfuck
            I played like 2 hours and haven't touched it since. I really need to play more...
        If it's a 4 hour game, I probably played an hour of it. I played it with some friends though, so I didn't get fully immersed. Maybe that's part of what's missing.
            Long story short, portal was born from a University project and the first game is basically a demo. It doesn't have shiny graphics, a very detailed story, or soundtrack. 

If you enjoy the mechanics and appreciate the dark humour from glados' dialogues, you will love the second game.

If you don't find it funny, it's okay, it's just not your thing. But I would recommend restarting it, listening to whatever Glados says and finishing it, and then you can consider buying the second or not. It's worth noting that Portal 2 has a co-op mode where you can play an additional, separate campaign with ONE friend, which is also fun. (Also it has local split screen so your friend doesn't have to own the game if you play locally)
i think the hype is more about on its sequel
Portal is good, but you should play portal 2 if you wanna know why people love it so much
Music, gameplay, mods, lore, CAKE
    But isn't the cake a lie?
        Its still CAKE
        But GLaDOS said there would be cake! Don’t you trust her?
In my opinion, you have to take into account when it came out. It's physics, gameplay style, and story were good, especially for 16 years ago. Plus it still holds up well today.  
It's a fun puzzle game with a good story.

Take the original Half Life game as another example. A lot of people playing it for the first time today (especially younger people) wouldn't really get why it is considered such a great game. But when it came out, it changed FPS games.  
(Now I'm not exactly saying Portal changed gaming in the same way, just an example of how when a game came out has an impact on why it can be seen the way it is years later.)
The more the chambers go by, the more the atmosphere builds on itself, to be honest, I just love it because of the portals but Glados’s dialogue is classic, and the puzzles get increasingly more complex, 
Also it’s kinda silly to ask what the hype is without spoilers hahaha
    That's fair, but I figured it might be something unrelated to the plot. Like, maybe people just really like portals and I'm one of the few who don't.
You’ll understand once you beat portal 2 (but whatever you do don’t beat portal 2 first)
First game has a pretty iconic credits sequence. ;)

If you don’t like portals and puzzles, the game just might not be for you.  

Also, first game has one annoying element that the sequel improves.  The energy ball in Portal is annoying since it’s so slow and keeps you waiting. Portal 2 fixes that complaint.
I really love the concept of portal I think it adds a layer to puzzles that I’ve never seen before I don’t remember how old I was when I played portal 1 but I bought the orange box and went straight for portal and was eagerly waiting for portal 2 to release even pre ordered it

But again it’s just the concept for me playing with portals is so unique all the characters could be taken out and I’d still love it but gladdos’s personality is a boost and in the second game there’s a lot more characters and more which makes the game feel like an actual place
Get through the game then play the second one. Even if it’s not your personal favorite, you’ll understand why it’s a cult classic
    Honestly, that's enough to push me through them. Thank you.
I find it interesting seeing people say that it’s mainly the sequel that generated hype


The way I remember it in 2007 is that the first portal generated a huge amount of hype. Introduced some pretty mind blowing mechanics and there was just a lot of hype for the orange box in general


But more than that, it was the memes. You just couldn’t get away from “The cake is a lie” wherever you went. Everybody seemed to know that phrase, I think the first portal invaded public consciousness in a way the sequel didn’t. My friend’s mum had to ask me what it was from at one point because all the students where she taught kept saying it
We all have different opinions, I wanted to give the portal physics ago cause i found that it was such an awesome mechanic. It's like how people rave about zelda but i just ain't bothered by it
The in game dialogue is everything
I don't understand what you mean by "Hype"?  Portal 1 & 2 are over a decade old.

It is a well put together sci-fi puzzle game with dark humor.  And portals are just fun to play with.

If you don't like the genre you aren't going to like the game.  Another example, I think Street Fighter 6 is one of the best in the series, but if you don't motion controls or fighting games, you aren't going to enjoy it.
While portal 1 is good, it isnt as great as portal two was/ still is. I really recommend playing 1 through though (its fairly short)
If you haven't finished it, then it probably just seems like an escape room with a robotic voice saying creepy things. There's a bit more of a storyline at the end, but Portal 2 has all the action.
Portal 1 has a novel idea, portal 2 is the true masterpiece of storeytelling
    Happy cake day!
Go play it, and you'll either Understand It™ or you'll think it wasn't that great, and that's okay too. It's really short, if you already know all the solutions to the tests it lasts about an hour.
First one is great but Portal 2 is what makes its characters, story, lore, and puzzles very memorable and leaves you wanting more.
The hype is portal 2 my friend
You know how some autistic people have safe foods? Portal is my safe game, it’s predictable but still fun and enjoyable. And eye contact is never an option. Plus GlaDOS is a half my personality when dealing with people.
    I love that, honestly. Glad you have that.
The gameplay is unique, innovative, and exceptionally well-crafted, the story is well-thought out and executed, and the writing and dialogue are excellent. It's one of the gamed many, including me, would consider perfect. If you don't like puzzle games, I understand not liking Portal, but if you do, it is one of the best games out there.
Well it's a long story actually

Most of the praise is because of nostalgia, the game came out when most where children or started to play video games, it also was a technical prowess at the time, it was one if not the most beautiful game made, the mechanics are well done and the designs are really nice. It's also the continuing of portal 1 so people that already knew portal where exited. Finally the characters are juste priceless and really well done, you can, in only one play through, name every single character from the solo and co-op initiative. 

TL:DR it's a nostalgia and a technical win
The character GLaDOS. Full stop. You get more of her as you play through... and as you finish... each game.
Portal 1 isn't everyone's favorite cup of coffee. Try 2nd.
For me personally I love games that have underlying stories that you find out as you play, which portal has. Just discovering little tidbits about the facility and finding rattmann's dens and then in portal 2 hearing what happened to Cave and Caroline, I love it so much lol

Valve have released a lot of beloved titles, progressing video game technology and artistic achievements alongside their technical advances.

I guess your question is similar to asking why snow white is so popular, or why everyone likes toy story.
It's because it's a creative and heartfelt piece, from a studio that a lot of people are attached to. Plus it has the bonus of being revolutionary. The programming behind some of the impossible mechanics, and the way the audio programming is implemented is so painfully difficult. Those who recognise these things are blown away. Which really sets the piece apart for some, as just an awesome achievement.
i can't really praise it without spoilers so if you wanna know you will have to play. the second one is really the one that everyone loves. play 1, is very short. then 2 is kinda the "real game" where it actually has plot
"Why the hype?"

"No I haven't played the games"

Just play the games. You own them. Find out for yourself rather than asking for answers that have to tiptoe around the reasonings.
Ok the first one is good but the sequel is one of of not THE best first person puzzle game
Also some good humor
