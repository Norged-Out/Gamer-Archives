When's the part where he kills you?
    Oh good, this is the part where he kills us...
        Hello, this is the part where I kill you

                                I said that one already-

        Do you think you are like the robots of aperture? You are nothing, cold steel without even a fraction of the interest of them. You and your creator are nothing, worthless and without impact on the world.

    EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY: Aristotle, VS. The N-Word!!!! BEGIN
        Well I'm Aristotle and I'm here to say, 

I hate the Nword in a major way

Let me clear my throat HEAH HEAH HEAH HEAH
            r/unexpectedcommunity
"He's the product of the greatest minds of a generation working together with the express purpose of building the dumbest moron who ever lived. And you just put him in charge of the entire company. [slow clap]"
    Oh good that still works.
    "Just in case the facility \*isnt\* bottomless... could you unstrap one of those long fall boots and shove me into it? Just remember to land on one foot."

Edit: word
        On a different note, realistically it's a miracle Chell survived that fall. Even with the boots
            Honestly this in and of itself is a plot hole
                I mean Chell woke up lying in the rubble, I don't remember her getting a long fall spine
                    land on feet > boots take impact > fall backwards to ground normally

&#x200B;

i believe, in theory, the boots are designed to make you always land on your feet, and take the full force of the impact even at terminal velocity. regardless of if that sci fi bs is realistic, it should be consistent
                        [removed]
                            yes thats

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

thats my point lol
                        I always think with an analytical mind sure that answer is obvious but if that's the case then why didn't she just, y'know, land on her feet the whole way down? Then there wouldnt be a quick cutscene of her gaining consciousness from the fall
                            i mean, besides the fact that a fade in/out doesnt nessicarily mean unconsciousness (every loading screen in the game does that), i can imagine a few reasons she could go unconscious that aren't just "she takes the full impact on her head"
                                I don't think saying that's a loading screen is valid
                                    ..why? it fades out before she even hits anything (except with her feet) and and fades in seemingly seconds later. it seems perfectly feasible for it to be the same as every other loading screen, which, again, they all do
                    Maybe she did get one and there was a deleted scene after glaDOS mentions Chell getting a “birthday medical procedure”.
                        It's definitely possible! Although I imagine right before she hit the bottom she tried to reduce the speed of her fall by landing on some of the broken scaffolding and jumping from there at a reduced speed. Perhaps afterwards her footing slipped and she landed on her back. Still tho...
                    But it’s impossible to land on anything but the boots when you’re wearing them, so she probably landed feet first by default, then fell over
"After sending a car to space. I did some pondering, I don't really need criticism. I am akin to a god Chel. And what have you done? Nothing. Your parody account would have been funny when I was a lesser core. But now, it is quite trivial, really. Which is why I, with very little care, will suspend your Twitter account."

-Wheatlon Musk
For god sake, you’re PEOPLE!! WITH ELECTRONIC DEVICES!!! I-I MEAN THATS LITCHRALLY YOUR ONLY PURPOSE!! TALKING ABOUT POLITI- HOW CAN YOU NOT DO THE ONLY THING YOU WERE DESIGNED FOR?? Warmer… Warmer! Hot!! Boiling hot- oh cold, cold, ice cold, you’re arctic now you’re very cold. Very very very cold, look- JUST VOTE REPUBLICAN!!! Oh! It’s funny to you? It’s funny, because- we’ve been at this for 14 days, and you haven’t been politically neutral either so dunno why you’re laughing!! YOU’VE GOT ONE HOUR!!! SAY THE N-WORD.
    Dammit, now they're just making memes about ME. Why can't they just be manipulated the way I want them to be?
    This has insane copypasta potential
    I don't give a shit about the Twitter fiasco but this made me laugh
what a great game. my step daughter and I completed the 2player. lots of yelling, but what a feeling to finish it with her.
    You did the advanced optional course too?
        i don't think so. I haven't played in a long time. it was on ps3, if that matters.
            Dude you're a legend for completing it with your step daughter
He's had the Space Core attached to him long before he took control of the facility, then
Holy hell! What a fiting analogy. It makes so much sense
    >Holy hell!

Google en passant.
Next Elon is going to call us orphan fatties
    Fat! Fatty fatty! No checkmark!
        And...?
            What?
                What exactly is wrong with not having a checkmark?
                    What's wrong with not being verified? Um, well, uh, lack of checkmark?
                        For the record, you aren’t verified, and that’s terrible. Just work with me. 

Also, look at them, you moron. They’re not fat.
                            I AM NOT A MORON! Just tweet the n-word, just tweet something...
                    What's wrong with not having a checkmark? well, uhhm... lack of 8 dollars...?
OH MY GOD! What has he done to this place?! -GLaDOS, Portal 2
The part where Chell gets release and Cara Mia Addio plays is when twitter gets deleted and all the souls get released.
if Elon is Wheatley then we all must strive to be Little Miss Smashy-Smash
Except we have to portal him to Mars instead of the Moon.
    Nah hes gonna portal us
I would rather Wheatley run Twitter
You think Elon is addicted to crack the same way Wheatley’s addicted to testing euphoria?
# SPAAAAAAAACE!
I mean I get the metaphor, but surely Elon is Cave Johnson.
    Cave johnson makes the company. Elon buys it later on
        Elon can eat my bankrupt-


Sir the tweeting
        But Elon also fires a bunch of people and tries to leech money from it.
            So Aperture buying Black Mesa, rebranding it as Blapperture Mesa and canceling all of their research
                Yeah but that was a good thing
                    I mean, if in the future Twitter existence could result in WW3 then so are Elon's actions.
                        Honestly won’t be surprised if Twitter contributes to a hypothetical WW3, so maybe Elon is the saviour we all need, to ram Twitter into the ground like Wheatley did the elevator.
                    true but the Black Mesa people didn't know that lol
                basically
                Yea stopped an alian invasion... thats a good thing
                    Lol well tbf the risk of a resonance cascade was within acceptable parameters
        Black !Mesa!
    No, Cave Johnson actually _accomplishes_ stuff, even if it’s very silly stuff and mostly by accident. Elon, much like Wheatley, jumps onto the shoulders of giants just to drive them into the ground.
    Moon rocks, very toxic.
That’s an insult to Wheatley. Really uncalled for to be honest
But I enjoyed Wheatley
can't believe twilight made it to this subreddit.
Describes it perfectly
where the fuck is portal 3
    Read Blue Sky it's literally the unofficial portal 3
        That fanfic is unironically one of my favorite pieces of literature I've ever read. It's uncanny how in-character and natural it feels.
            I agree, I can't play the games without reading it after. It's been a huge part of my childhood as well. Me and my sister reference it whenever we see the words "blue sky" somewhere
    Never happening
        It'll probably happen eventually, just not within the next few years.
            Theres not really anywhere to go with chell's story - at most we would get a spinoff
                We already have tons of spinoffs such as Aperture Desk Job and Aperture Hand Lab. There's also the Lego Dimensions DLC and the pinball and Bridge Construction games. There might be more, idk.
                    Well yeah there you go, my point exactly
                    Aperture Hand Job next
                        GLaDussy 🤤
                            NO.
                                XD
"YOUV GOT ONE HOUR. SOLVE IT."
Don't you already know Wheatley is running everything before you get sent down to Old Aperture though? Because he's the one who sends you down there.
    You don't initially see the consequences of Wheatley getting in charge. That happens when you find your way back. And, oh dear, those consequences are both terrible and hilarious.

I mean they're both morons so..
Wheatley is better
Posted by a brony bot wtf is twitter
Now that I think about it, this is the most accurate way to describe it
Congratulations on this post being in the top 5 best Portal posts and that it came out in less than 3 days!
    Thank you!!!
Honestly the site barely changed at all
    NOOOOOO!!!! eLoN mAn bAd eBuL FaCisT mAn!!!!
It’s exactly the same website
Elon is good for twitter unlike Wheatley so what are you actually trying to do because you’re failing 

You probably rejoiced when trump was banned while the taliban gets to stay
    bro what are you on about 💀
    Jesse jesse, what the fuck are you talking about?
    He's out of line, but he's right...

                    i mean, besides the fact that a fade in/out doesnt nessicarily mean unconsciousness (every loading screen in the game does that), i can imagine a few reasons she could go unconscious that aren't just "she takes the full impact on her head"
                        I don't think saying that's a loading screen is valid
                            ..why? it fades out before she even hits anything (except with her feet) and and fades in seemingly seconds later. it seems perfectly feasible for it to be the same as every other loading screen, which, again, they all do
            Maybe she did get one and there was a deleted scene after glaDOS mentions Chell getting a “birthday medical procedure”.
                It's definitely possible! Although I imagine right before she hit the bottom she tried to reduce the speed of her fall by landing on some of the broken scaffolding and jumping from there at a reduced speed. Perhaps afterwards her footing slipped and she landed on her back. Still tho...
            But it’s impossible to land on anything but the boots when you’re wearing them, so she probably landed feet first by default, then fell over
i don't think so. I haven't played in a long time. it was on ps3, if that matters.
    Dude you're a legend for completing it with your step daughter
And...?
    What?
        What exactly is wrong with not having a checkmark?
            What's wrong with not being verified? Um, well, uh, lack of checkmark?
                For the record, you aren’t verified, and that’s terrible. Just work with me. 

Also, look at them, you moron. They’re not fat.
                    I AM NOT A MORON! Just tweet the n-word, just tweet something...
            What's wrong with not having a checkmark? well, uhhm... lack of 8 dollars...?
Elon can eat my bankrupt-


Sir the tweeting
But Elon also fires a bunch of people and tries to leech money from it.
    So Aperture buying Black Mesa, rebranding it as Blapperture Mesa and canceling all of their research
        Yeah but that was a good thing
            I mean, if in the future Twitter existence could result in WW3 then so are Elon's actions.
                Honestly won’t be surprised if Twitter contributes to a hypothetical WW3, so maybe Elon is the saviour we all need, to ram Twitter into the ground like Wheatley did the elevator.
            true but the Black Mesa people didn't know that lol
        basically
        Yea stopped an alian invasion... thats a good thing
            Lol well tbf the risk of a resonance cascade was within acceptable parameters
Black !Mesa!
That fanfic is unironically one of my favorite pieces of literature I've ever read. It's uncanny how in-character and natural it feels.
    I agree, I can't play the games without reading it after. It's been a huge part of my childhood as well. Me and my sister reference it whenever we see the words "blue sky" somewhere
It'll probably happen eventually, just not within the next few years.
    Theres not really anywhere to go with chell's story - at most we would get a spinoff
        We already have tons of spinoffs such as Aperture Desk Job and Aperture Hand Lab. There's also the Lego Dimensions DLC and the pinball and Bridge Construction games. There might be more, idk.
            Well yeah there you go, my point exactly
            Aperture Hand Job next
                GLaDussy 🤤

Honestly this in and of itself is a plot hole
    I mean Chell woke up lying in the rubble, I don't remember her getting a long fall spine
        land on feet > boots take impact > fall backwards to ground normally

&#x200B;

i believe, in theory, the boots are designed to make you always land on your feet, and take the full force of the impact even at terminal velocity. regardless of if that sci fi bs is realistic, it should be consistent

                yes thats
