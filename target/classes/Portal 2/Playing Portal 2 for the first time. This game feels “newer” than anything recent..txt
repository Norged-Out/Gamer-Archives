[[Playing Portal 2 for the first time. This game feels “newer” than anything recent.]]


Something about it just feels so good/fluid/impressive? I’m not sure how to describe it, but it’s amazing!


That game is utterly timeless. It'll still feel fairly new when it gets to its 25th anniversary.
    Because it's so rare for a new game to be *truly* unique. Not that every game needs to be, but when a game is it becomes very memorable.

Also, people can stop making willfully ignorant comments pretending they don't realize I'm talking about the Portal franchise and not just Portal 2. You're not clever.
        It also picked a graphic style and color palette that never feels dated.  Similar to wind waker and it's cell shaded graphics. Turns out when you only need to make a grungy lab consisting of white walls and portals you can make it rather detailed for 2011.
            It also has amazing voice acting. GladOS, Wheatley, Cave Johnson... so good. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley is so good.

*Most test subjects do experience some cognitive deterioration after a few months in suspension. Now you've been under for... quite a lot longer, and it's not out of the question that you might have a very minor case of serious brain damage. But don't be alarmed, alright? Although, if you do feel alarm, try to hold onto that feeling because that is the proper reaction to being told you have brain damage.*
                I still think my favorite part of the game is Cave Johnson freaking out about how he doesn't want any damn lemons and he's going to make a combustible lemon to burn life's house down.
                    After speaking to the manager!
                Say goodnight Carolyn!
                    She is a gem.
                I can perfectly hear the dialogue inside my head
            Mirror's Edge(2008) is also pretty timeless in the graphics department. Turns out if the environment is a dystopian white concrete hell you can get away with a lot of graphical shortcuts.
            BoTW, ToTK, Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, and every other 3D Zelda title still takes a back seat to how fucking magical wind waker is. Such a brilliant game.
                Wind Waker really needs a true sequel. I would love a hybrid game of Wind Waker and BoTW where it's an open world sailing Zelda game with crafting and cell shaded graphics.  My one complaint in Wind Waker is how it feels open world but it kind of isn't.  You really go to certain islands in a certain order instead of sailing at random. If they could find a way to make the islands more random and less order mandatory it would be so cool.
                    I think that comes down to a limitation of the game cube more than anything. Windwaker carried the style of the 2d games better and was just charming from start to end.
        Well at the same time when there is half of the games release by the main publishers being basically Far Cry / Assasin's Creed or trying to be the next fortnite, obviously there is not lot of originality recently
            Theres also a lot of survivals all of a sudden.
                All of sudden? 

Were u living under a rock for like 10 years?
                    Go easy, he's just surviving out here with the rest of us
            > trying to be the next fortnite

This reminded me that the real halo killer was halo all along. :( 

So many console sci-fi shooters trying to be the next "halo killer" but all it took was a dude named Brian Reed to make Halo the "bad guy" when we all knew eh was a pretty cool guy.
                I had a good bit of fun with splitgate. It even had a decent surge of players a bit before the latest halo came out. Basically just halo with portals and it felt nice and pretty fun.
                Wait, what happened, exactly?
                    Brian Reed was head story writer on Halo 5 which put the player as a member of Fireteam Osiris (Locke). Players didn't enjoy the story or locke much and people think made them put the main-line halo games to bed in favor of whatever halo infinite is for a while.

He was fired in 2017, btw.
        Are people really commenting to tell you that portal 2 isn’t original and is actually rather derivative of a less known indie game known as Portal, and that you probably never heard of it? Lmfao.
            … [long drag on cigarette]
        I think it also helps that the game isn't focused on human models that the industry is currently trying to jam over to the other side of the uncanny valley.
        Most mainstream games now are the same military/murder simulators over and over again.
            And then you have Spec Ops: The Line
    It’s also simultaneously hilarious and heartfelt.  One of the best games of all time.

I often wonder what a VR port would be like and how many times I would throw up playing it.
        There is one! And I can't recommend it enough: [https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr/releases/tag/v0.2.0-preview.1](https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr/releases/tag/v0.2.0-preview.1)

It honestly feels like the game was made for it. You get used to flinging yourself through the air, its surprisingly not *that* sickness inducing ^if ^you ^close ^your ^eyes
            [deleted]
                give it a try if you can. i dont get motion sickness but a weird uncomfortable feeling if a game takes over the camera in unexpected ways and portal felt surprisingly natural. it also immediately snaps you in position when you enter exit the portal without standard animation guess that helps a lot.
if you can handle it it is one of the best gaming experiences there are and way better than it was on a flat screen.
                    I recall in an interview, someone at valve said they really looked into doing an official portal vr port, and scrapped it because the vast majority of users got extremely sick no matter how they tried to handle the portal transitions. And it makes sense. I'm sure it's fun if you can handle it, but the main cause of motion sickness in vr is when you appear to be moving without actually moving irl. Can't avoid that when flying through a portal. Surprisingly when I first got the original rift *years* ago, when I'd have people try it, almost nobody could stomach Google earth vr because you are flying around.
        There's a mod for vr.
    Fun fact: We're closer to Portal 2's 25th anniversary than we are to its release.
        No it isn’t. 
Checks release date. 
Damnit.
        Orange box came out 17 years ago. 

Fuck.
            still probably the best value in terms of game quality to $$ that I've ever spent though
                HL2 + episodes, TF2, and Portal for 60 bucks? Absolute steal, was my first time getting to experience any half life, as well.
                    I bought years later in 2014 for like 25 CAD on PS3, and everything in it still felt brand new.
                        I never even knew it had a PS3 release, that's pretty neat
                    50 on steam akshully
        I don’t care what the facts say, you’re wrong
        That is not fun.
        What!? Im 28 and i swear portal 2 came out when i was like 10. Crazy
    You can't just say shit like "25th anniversary" so casually what the hell. This game only came out 5 years ago and it still will have 20 years from now.

            Maybe they meant the PlayStation Portal? Could have gotten their handhelds mixed up
                I could maybe see that if the portal looked high tech, it technically is but not so much in relation to all other devices nowadays

                *slow clap* “Oh good. That’s still working”
                I will never forget the first time I heard this line. My then-GF and I absolutely lost our shit, had to pause play while we wiped tears away.

                            "I will say, though, you must really, really love to test. I love it too. There's just one thing we need to take care of first..."
                        This is the line. This is the one that's my favorite in the game.
                I think my favourite is the fat shaming reads. 

"Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds."
                    The best one was from the co-op mode:

"Did you know humans frown on weight variances? If you want to upset a human, just say that their weight variance is above or below the norm."
                    Look at you, sailing through the air majestically. Like an Eagle. Piloting a blimp.

        Take the damn lemons back!
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
    "All right, I’ve been thinking. When live gives you lemons? Don’t make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! ‘I don’t want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these?’ Demand to see life’s manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am?

        “Goodbye Mr Johnson.”
        Burning people! He said what we're all thinking!
    FEELS GUILTY NOT BEING IN SPAAAACE !!!!!
That game is an absolute masterpiece.
    A triumph if you will
        yeah fr, someone should make a note here, this is a huge success
            It's honestly hard to overstate my satisfaction with the game
                I mean you in apature science after all, you do what you must because you can.
                    Its for the good of all of us, after all. Except the ones who are dead. They would be fine with it.
                        Yeah there's truly no sense crying over every mistake.
                            Personally, I think the other game companies need to keep trying til they run out of (metaphorical) cake
                                And the games will get done and they'll make some neat fun for the players who are still alive
                                    I'm not even angry about this chain of puns
        For Science
            You monster 
        I'll make a note, huge success.
            You are a terrible person, it says so right here. Terrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
        I see what you did there. It almost feels like 2009 again
        I will
        This was a triumph
    That's why it's in MoMA's collection.
    The trolling you can do to a friend is top notch.
    The whole lead up to it with the Potato Sack was super fun too.  Having to play through a level of Amnesia to get a fucking potato, however, was not.
I wish I could play Portal 2 for the first time again
    Same, especially the coop because then I could play it with different people without knowing all the solutions which kinda ruins it.
        I tried to play the coop with my nephew last year. I had never played it before but he's played it many times. It very quickly became unfun as he proceeded to rush through all the solutions while I was still trying to figure them out.
            Yea I mean that's on your nephew but can't really blame him. When I played with people I sat back and let them take the lead. I would only gently guide them if they got stuck
                We quickly realized neither of us were having fun and played something else instead haha
            This was my 1st experience in co-op with a rando. They actually started berating me because I didn't know what to do as soon as we walked into a room. I had already beat the sp so I uninstalled. Couple years later my son was born. We beat co-op together last year, he was 9. It was incredible.
        Portal 2 has my favourite co-op puzzle of all time, the one where the exit is directly in the middle of two angled portal platforms that launch you way over the middle so it seems impossible to land there. Where the solution is >!that both players have to go through at the same time and collide in mid-air to stall your jump!<.

It's the one puzzle I absolutely refuse to give any hints on if I'm playing it with someone new, because it's such a satisfying solution to arrive at yourself.
            That one is brilliant!

My sister and I were trying to solve it for ages, then she had to leave. An hour or so later the solution flashed into my brain and I had to confirm it! But nobody else was around. So I somehow managed to use both controllers at once and still get Atlas and Peabody to slam into each other! Even bigger success!

Solo dual-controller triumph?
        If you are on PC, there are hundreds of fantastic custom made co-op levels available through steam workshop.
            and thousands of terrible ones too!
        Me and a buddy pretty much played all the community maps there were. There are some really fun challenges on there that border on masochism. So much fun to be had there.
    Holy shit same
    Same, I was *over the moon* for that one moment near the end that I don't want to spoil. I wish I could experience it with a fresh mind.
        God the whole build up leading to you figuring out that last puzzle in the climax was a masterful blending of story and puzzle you don't really see elsewhere
            So much of that game was masterfully crafted. There’s a moment where you are bouncing on some gel and having a conversation with Wheatley in the rafters every time you hit the apex of the jump and it is SO naturally and perfectly comedically timed I still don’t think I’ve been quite so entertained by a game since
            Yeah, and fun fact, I'll keep it vague but you'll know, the developers actually took the time to code in the impulse for the portal gun, all through the game it's effectively instant, it's going the speed of light, but the distance from you to the wall is close enough that instant is fine. But for one particular shot, the distance is exactly how long it would *really* take to reach the target. There is a noticable pause, and that pause is ***accurate.***
    And the first Portal game...
        And the third Portal game... oh wait
            Portal Revolution came out recently and it was absolutely superb
    Check out "Portal Stories: Mel" and "Portal Revolution" on Steam. You're welcome.
    As someone with a ps5, I wish I could just play it again.
        It has very low requirements, if you have a computer it can probably run it.
    I waited maybe 7 years between playthroughs, and it felt as close to new as I could've probably hoped for.
You will love Cave Johnson.
    We're just throwin' science at the wall to see what sticks.
        The science boys haven't nailed down what element it is yet, but we do know it's a lively one and it DOES NOT like the human skeleton
            Those of you who volunteered to be injected with praying mantis DNA, I've got some good news and some bad news. Bad news is we're postponing those tests indefinitely. Good news is we've got a much better test for you: fighting an army of mantis men. Pick up a rifle and follow the yellow line.
                You’ll know when the test starts.
                    I can hear this comment thread
            Sounds like Cadmium.
        Science isn't about WHY, it's about WHY NOT!
    Alright I've been thinking, when life give you lemons..
        Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons, what am I supposed to do with these?
            DEMAND TO SEE LIFE'S MANAGER!!!  MAKE LIFE RUE THE DAY IT DECIDED TO GIVE CAVE JOHNSON LEMONS!!!

        Unfortunately cave forgot that lemons are a human created hybrid fruit. Life didn’t give us lemons, we gave ourselves lemons.

        I just watched Whiplash recently, and the part where he says "I can still see you, Mini-Me!" made me instantly think of how Cave Johnson berates his employees
    The GOAT of NPC's.
    One of my favorite characters in anything
    I’ve been having a BLAST playing around with the Cave Johnson GPT ai 🤣😭🤣😭 it’s literally *perfect*
        Wait what? Does it speak in his voice or just respond in Cave Johnson mannerisms? Is it just regular ol chat gpt or did someone make something portal related?
            I have no clue how it’s made, but I know that not all Cave Johnson GPTs are created equally. Some are simply fed a transcript, but the one by Jon McCumber (the one I like most) is more like the real deal and it’s not just a parrot reading lines like the other ones. No voices, but it’s so on-point that none are needed lol honestly 🤣

Ask him about flat earth, or about other caves from parallel universes no matter how whacky it may seem, send him a screenshot of a meme, anything you do with the man is just… chef’s kiss 😚
    [All the Cave Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJnIpCu1JBM) you can get, including the alternate reality ones.
    Fun fact: he's voiced by the yellow M&M
I know right it ages so well.
    I’m glad I picked it up because I can already tell it’s quality is off the charts.
        Back when games were completed before they hit the market
            And when they added stuff, it felt like stuff that deserved to get tacked on and made the game better as opposed to something that should have been there before.  The co-OP chambers and perpetual testing initiative make a great game better.
            why are you acting like that doesn't happen? you're looking in the wrong place if it does
                It happens, but goddamn is the ratio dipping down lately
            It even released early because we powered up GLaDOS with potatoes.
            Nah they were definitely unfinished buggy messes that just never got fixed or only got fixed in rereleases. 

“It’s not a bug itsa feature” followed bethesda way before skyrim was released. 

Theres a few final fantasy bosses in specific versions of the games you cant face in certain orders without crashign the game.

First two gens of pokemon were held together with paperclips and prayers. 

It’s just more common now due to volume + complexity + ability to fix as needed. Which the third one is a big negative, but even ignoring that wed still see more just cause of volume + complexity.
            Hoooly shit ppl just willfully ignore the past like 30 years of shovelware. There have always been shittily produced games, and yet the vast majority of non live-service titles even in recent years have been released in a complete state (and even many of those have a solid base release experience).
            Seriously. This makes me look at all the recent stuff coming out half baked with even more disdain.
Portal 2 is a masterpiece. Definitely one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had.
I honestly think Portal 2 is maybe the highest quality video game ever made. That doesn’t make it my favorite (though it’s up there), there are games with flaws that have a bigger place in my heart, but if someone asked me what a perfect video game looks like this is the game I’d show them.
    Source engine is amazing, it still feels so good after all this time
        Too many developers allow player movement and responsiveness in input to be a low priority. 

People who didn't grow up on the quake 1/2/3 and goldsource engines straight up don't understand how snappy and responsive everything was back in the day.

Most modern shooters feel like you're moving around on iceskates and aiming input has a subtle lag that just feels *off* compared to the older engines.

Valve feels like one of the only companies that really put player movement and input as a top priority, and built the engine out from that as a baseline.
            It's true across genres, too. I don't play MMOs anymore but when I did, the thing that kept WoW on top despite its questionable expansions and other issues was its movement and responsiveness. Outside of server latency, you press W and you move forward. You cast a spell and it casts. I tried others and it felt like animation quality took precedent over player control and "feel".
                Yeah, i think a big contributor to it is having momentum in the player as a variable, where you accelerate and decelerate with movement. It's usually pretty subtle, but makes the 'floaty' feeling of a lot of games very noticeable.
            This is why TF2 has not only managed to survive despite not getting any new content for 6 years but has actually grown.
            all the modern games try to feel "realistic" in their movements. I fucking hate it. It's why battlefield bad company 2 was so good and battlefield 3 after it sucked. its why GTA 5 sucks with the floppy fucking movements. Devs are forgetting were playing video games and dont want to feel rEAliSm in how our magic face melting characters move
    The writing, art style, controls, gameplay, that ENDING. 

It might actually be the best made game.
        God, that moment when it clicks in your head how you beat the final boss, that you have to >!shoot a portal at the fucking moon!<, that's genuinely one of the coolest moments in any video game I've played. My jaw was on the floor
            Absolutely one of the best player executed story moments in gaming!
                I love all the moments leading up to it. Mentions of moon rocks and moon dust and whatnot all over the place. Even if you paid zero attention to any of the dialogue the game makes it so explicit that white surface is portal-able and black isn’t. Then comes the final cutscene, the moon, glowing white, contrasted by the pitch black night sky. Nothing needs to be said, it just clicks. Magnificent finale.
                    ...and the best thing is that it came out of a scrapped easter egg. There was supposed to be a visible moon near the beginning of the game, and if you placed a portal there you would get sucked in, die and get a fake ending with a song and credits rolling (I believe that was the original purpose of Exile Vilify in the game). However, they couldn't figure out how to end the battle with Wheatley in a satisfying way for quite a long time and in the end they scrapped the fake endings concept and just reused the one with the moon for the boss fight.
                    Valve has always been amazing at keeping small details in their games that just make their environments feel so alive. Playing half life 2 feels more lifelike than a lot of AAA environments. Not to mention half life alyx which is just fucking beautiful
                    Valve is exceptional at guiding the player without outright telling them what to do. The developer commentary for Portal 1 shows just how much thought goes into everything they make you do. Throwing the companion cube in the furnace is actually a small tutorial for doing the same thing to the cores during GLaDOS’ boss fight.
            A neat thing about that is how it's setup so there are only two places where you can have portals, one being by the button so you're all ready to do it, but placing the final portal triggers the end of the game even if you use the wrong one
        FUN FACT: Voice actor for Glados sang the ending opera
            FUN FACT: Voice actor for GLaDOS is married to the voice actor of Sniper from TF2.
                FUN FACT: The voice actor for GLaDOS is also the voice actor for the Administrator in Team Fortress 2, the Combine Overwatch in Half-Life 2, Brood Mother and Death Prophet in Dota 2, and the Witch in Left 4 Dead 2 (and 1).
                    I'm having so much fun right now
            Ellen McLain is wonderful
            GlaDOS was also the computer's voice in Gypsy Danger in Pacific Rim. Guillermo del Toro did that on purpose because of Ellen McLain's voice work in the Portal games.
            FUN FACT: The voice of Glados is the same voice used in Pacific Rim for the Jaeger AI
        speaking of the ending...I can't explain why, but I will never fail to be moved by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90iFStSMnH4) someone made of an animation of Chell outside feeling the rain after escaping, while rain sounds play along with Exile Vilify (the song The National contibuted to the Portal 2 soundtrack).

it provokes an emotion I don't even know how to describe.  maybe not as moving to others as it is to me, but just wanted to share it.
            I loved so many of the Portal user created videos for that song.
        BEEEEEWOOOOOOOoooooo^ooooooo ..... 

****ding!****
    HL Alyx up there too
        Alyx has ruined VR for me. Nothing else gets even remotely close and it really feels like Valve is the only studio who actually seriously gave a shit about putting out a AAA VR title.

Its not my favorite game, but it was absolutely 100% the best singleplayer gaming experience ive had. ever.
            Alyx exists because of the intersection of two things... Two things that intersect nowhere else in the gaming industry:

1. Game developer has virtually infinite money.

2. Game developer is privately owned and has no obligation to shareholders to attempt to turn a profit on their game.

Valve is the only company that can make a AAA+ quality game for a tiny audience.
                I'd say a couple more:

- Game developer is a major player in VR tech
- Game developer has IP with an engine that works in VR
            Dark souls ruined most pancake games for me, Alyx ruined most Vr games lol.
                I sold my headset a couple months after i put down Alyx for this very reason. I'll come back to VR in a couple years, at the very least just to play Alyx again.
            Yeah nothing really compares to the level of HL Alyx in the VR space. It was meant to be a launch title but years later it's still far and away the best title on VR.. and it's not even close. 

The problem with AAA VR games is two fold:

- they are expensive and technically challenging to make. 
- VR users are just a fraction of the PC gaming market... which itself is just a subset of the overall gaming market. 

So unfortunately AAA studios rather put their time and money into projects that support a wider audience instead of a niche one, which is a shame. They figure the juice isn't worth the squeeze.

This is also why you hardly ever see VR games go on sale.

I'm hoping VR becomes a little more mainstream especially now that Apple has gotten in it (kinda), but who knows. It may just remain this way for quite some time.
        Not that most people would know.
            It's sad that barely any people play alyx, because it's a VR game, it didn't sell that bad because it incentivized people to buy VR sets but it was for a less wider audience
        I stand by this. Portal 2 was the best game I'd ever played until I played Half-Life: Alyx. I wish more people would play it, it was shocking to not hear a ton of discussion about it when it released, simply because so few people have a VR headset. I've never had a game hit me like that game did, especially the ending.
            It will be like Portal, playable 10 years from now and still feel new. Mostly because it's still the king of VR and it's been years :(
                Nobody else has Valve money to do absolutely anything they want, even knowing it’ll never make a cent of profit.
                    So Microsoft now has less money than Valve? Did they spend it all on game companies again?
                        Microsoft want to make profits, they don’t make games for the love of making amazing groundbreaking games. Alyx was valve saying look we can do with VR.
                            It really is such a refreshing thing to deal with valves mindset on business compared to most others, with valve they're so confident in steam and their other high profit products that they decide to do stuff that is new and exciting every once in a while knowing it will probably lose money.

Compare that to really any other major company in gaming and its obvious. There's a sense of desperation in getting *everything* to make major profits, and if it's not doing that and can't be made to do that then it gets tossed to the wayside.
                    Valve literally says they make half life games to show off new tech
            Alyx was a life changer.
                100%.  There's literally nothing else like it.
                    One of the best games I've ever played and I can't finish it because I'm scared to pick up the flashlight
                        Dude, I was in the area with the flashlight and some headcrabs and my cat brushed past my leg.  I literally screamed.
            [deleted]
                Quest 3 and apple vr just came out within the last 4 months??
And if you have a pc capable of it you can play alyx plenty well on the quest
                    [deleted]
    I'm in the same boat. There are a lot of games that aren't my favorite, or that I even like but just playing it is like...this is some gourmet shit. 
    I like the first one more, it's more 'subtle'. And I like the atmosphere of not knowing what's going on and feeling kinda isolated even though that nice robot lady talks to you.   
In Portal 2 the setting is immediatly made clear and there is almost always some sort of companion with you, either Wheatly or the Glatato.
When you eventually complete it and start craving more, try The Talos Principle. It's more than capable to fill the void.
    I'd say go for Portal Stories Mel. It's a mod but it's on the steam store.
        Portal: Revolution should also be great. i think i'm going to try that one now.
            I thought it was even better than Mel.
            it's pretty much the exact same with a few extra mechanics. super fun though and very true to the original.
    Talos Principle 1 is worthwhile just to set up the amazing world in the sequel. The puzzles are top-tier and the writing is worthwhile, though it's heavily philosophical and not comedic.   


The Witness is also a brilliant first person puzzle game, overall it may be more difficult than Portal 2, and definitely the most cryptic of any of the above.
        Man, I loved the Talos Principle.  And now I've discovered there's a sequel.  Thanks!
            and the entire sequel is drop dead gorgeous
        The Witness got tedious fast for me. I remember going through the first sets of puzzles and then searching how long the average playthrough was and immediately stopping when I realized I'd be doing 17+ hours of these puzzles lol.
        Oh yeah, the Witness is amazing. Beautiful game. Sound design is top-notch. My only complaint is the >!birdsong puzzles. Ugh. I knew what I had to do, I just couldn't pick out the audio for the longer ones and had to look up the answers.!<
            Hah, that's funny. The eureka moment of figuring that one out was one of the game's highlights for me.
        As an avid puzzle enjoyer these games are all in my top 10, but The Witness holds the spot as my favourite game of all time.  
  
To start with I thought the puzzle format would get tedious, but it never did. On paper, it's all just line puzzles, but the inventive ways they manage to use that limited format throughout the game is incredible.  
    
More than anything through I just love the vibes of the game. A vibrant, colourful, mysterious, slightly lonely and melancholy feeling island with god knows how many things and places to poke around in and discover.   
     
People say this a lot, but I truly mean it when I say I wish I could wipe my memory of The Witness and replay it. Because one of my favourite aspects of the game inherently leaves it with almost no replay value, unfortunately.
    From a puzzle standpoint yes. From a writing standpoint? Absolutely not.


Edit: my comment was vastly misunderstood by some. Im not saying the writing of Talos is bad. Im saying its tough to recommend Talos from a writing perspective because they are SO different. 


If what you loved about Portal was the puzzles youll for sure love Talos. If what you loved was the writing, its a big toss up if youll love Talos.
        You really cannot compare. Portal is like a thriller movie while the Talos Principles is like a philosophy book. They also have different narrative designs but you could see that they both take a lot of effort.
        Talos 2 is like the jump from Portal 1 to Portal 2 story-wise. Its a fleshed out world with a pretty complete story.
            I'm just now learning there is a Talos 2. I absolutely loved the the first game. I'm so excited to get home from work tonight!
            I thought Talos 1 was a beautiful game when I played it on launch and again in 2019. Booted up Talos 2 on a 7900 XTX and i'm absolutely blown away by how detailed the UE5 environments are.

I kept looking down at my character's feet because the ground was covered in high-fidelity, fully modelled grass, pebbles, leaves, twigs, logs etc. that were all casting shadows! I really hope it secures some DLC.
        Talos Principle writing is solid - it’s just not comedy genre. Apples and oranges.
            Apples and Lemons*
                What, did life just give you lemons? I think you know what to do with them if you played Portal 2.
                    Burn down life's house with the lemons!
                    Turn them into incendiary grenades?
                “I don’t want your damn lemons!”
        The writing in the Talos Principle is stellar imo.
        Did someone avoid reading all the lore pieces in Talos? The writing is top tier. Of course the narrative and storytell are way different.
            I didnt say talos was bad. I meant that if you love puzzles talos fills that void wonderfully. 


But if you loved the writing of portal its not a garuntee to fill that void with Talos.


Its a great game but fills vastly different types of storytelling 
                Fair enough, buddy!
        I understand that some people really enjoy the writing and philosophy and lore in the Talos Principle. I sort of liked it in the first one... but I find myself skipping through all the diologue and lore and junk in the Talos Principle 2. It's a bit much. I wanna solve puzzles, not ponder the universe.
    And after that, Anti-Chamber!
        If you like Antichamber, you might also like Manifold Garden.
    I would also recommend *The Stanley Parable*.
        I would also recommend *Doom Eternal.*
        I will add Supraland. It's a bit different than the others but is a *very* solid puzzle game.
            Lol definitely a way better fit than The Stanley Parable. And not enough people have played it. The puzzles are so good.
            other puzzle game recommendations:  
ViewFinder (not that difficult, but creative)  
Superliminal  
Cocoon
        Great game.

The day I finally got to play it after the 5 year break was incredible.
        Friendly reminder about the "don't play for 5 years" or whatever achievement, for those who may have started trying to get that one!
    Personally The Witness gave me more of that feeling
        If you haven't check out Taiji. It's a 2D Witness.

On that note, the current Humble Bundle has a "mindbending masterpieces" sale that has Taiji, The Witness, The Talos Principle, Manifold Garden, Superliminal, Patrick's Parabox and The Pedestrian for about $20.

https://www.humblebundle.com/games/mindbending-masterpieces
    [Portal Revolution](https://store.steampowered.com/app/601360/Portal_Revolution/) came out (free) recently and it's freaking awesome too.
    The story is way massive than Portal, but the puzzles are great
    Also try: 
Light matter,
The entropy center
    I second the Talos Principle. Also, in case anyone missed it the Talos Principle is FULL of hidden content/easter eggs. Worth going back if you missed them.
    I played it for about 45 minutes about half a year ago, but found it a bit to cryptic. I couldn't really connect with the story presented at that point, and I found the puzzles a bit boring and repetetive.

Would you say the game gets better over time, or does the beginning give a good enough impression of the game to be able to tell if you like it or not.
        Imo, the game improves over time but if you really hated the first level it just might not be your game. I will also say that it is probably my favourite puzzle game of all time tho...
        I'd say completing the first world is enough to understand  whether you want to continue. The puzzles definitely get more variety when you unlock new puzzle elements, but the story is not spoonfed like in Portal. You can complete the game and remain oblivious to the story. It's for those people that like exploration and discovery.
I played Portal: Revolution last weekend. Highly recommend it, it's not as good as P2 but fantastic considering it's a mod. Definitely worth playing after you finish P2.
    And then after that portal stories mel. And then after that Portal Prelude. And then after that...
        Please! Give me more! I'm almost done with Revolution and I'm sad I'll be out of new content.
            Try Portal Reloaded
    Play Portal Stories: Mel! It's everything you liked about Revolution, except with much harder puzzles, 3x the runtime, and a truly absurd amount of environmental detail. The levels are seriously prettier/better designed than a lot of Portal 2.
For Steam Deck owners that think they just entered a parallel dimension, this is an "Asus ROG Ally".
    Grabbed one last week and being able to play FFXIV (with plugins!), Yakuza, GW2, most emulators because it's just Windows, etc. from my couch is so nice. Not feeling tethered to my desk my entire day between work and gaming is a godsend.
    Competition in PC handhelds.  And both can pretty much play anything. Life is good.
    And quite a bit more powerful if you’re willing to compromise on battery life
        And instant suspend
            And a proper update schedule that won’t bone you when you’re trying to just relax and play video games
        And instant suspend
        I almost never play mine not plugged in. 30w turbo mode FTW.
        Fr, I love my rog, but the battery doesn’t last me more than 4-5 hours even with some settings I stg💀

FYI: Usual lifespan is ~2 hours
    Thank god, I hate parallel dimensions. Never anywhere good to eat.
    Love mine. Bought the extreme chip, should be good for a couple years. I did have to send it in for them to fix the sd card slot though.
I can never get bored of that game, everything is just perfect from story to difficulty. Portal and the Limbo/Inside series are my "filler" games, always in rotation with new titles as my pallet cleansers.
    You'd probably like Cocoon, from same dude as Limbo+Inside.
Got a Steam Deck recently and played the Portal games for the first time. First game is good, short but sweet. Second is a goddamn masterpiece.
    Portal 1 is the goat. Every puzzle has multiple solutions, a player's creativity and ingenuity really shines here and there's an actual reason to go back and replay it. Portal 2 has great voice actors and dialogue lines and from a linear story perspective it's very engaging and memorable, but from a purely gameplay perspective every puzzle has exactly 1 solution. Once you've found it out there's nothing more to do but move on. Almost no replayability once you've beaten it.
        Exactly my problem with Portal 2. It's a better game than 1, but it's a worse puzzle game.
            1 >>>>>> 2 in every way imo
                [removed]
Why "newer"?

Good game design is timeless. That's what Portal is, timeless. That's why it feels good to play no matter when you play it.
The writing in this game. Unbeatable
    "We both said a lot of things that you’re going to regret.” - GLaDOS
I would always sound like a soundboard when I’d load up Portal 2 while discording with friends, literally saying each time how beautiful the games visuals have aged for a game made in 2011. Portal 2 is a very very nice looking game to this day.
Portal 2 is one of the greatest games ever designed and developed. The art is timeless, the humor is amazing and the story is immaculate
[deleted]
    It's a great game. But to say it's ~~more fluid~~ better than recent games is definitely a take.
        Graphically better? Hell no. But why can’t a game be someone’s personal favorite just because it’s old?
        [deleted]
            Yeah. I like the game, but saying it's the best of all time just ignores the innovation and advances made to future games.
    People in here going mad about the writing and Cave Johnson's character, when everything he fucking says is basically an angry man screaming the "holds up spork" monologue.
It’s an amazing and timeless game, but to say it feels “newer” than *anything* recent…? I take it you haven’t played many recent games?
    They're of the same camp that has spent $60 each on the last ~3 AAA titles that they were hammered over the head with and therefore have concluded all current games are bad.

It's a sentiment that never goes away, but it's slightly more popular right now for some reason. Probably because some kids got burned at Christmas? I don't know.
It’s always depressing for me to play old original games. They’re always soooo good and usually hold up remarkable well with a few quirks.

Meanwhile AAAA Skull and bones or whatever the f came out recently
    There were shitty games back then too
        unfortunately, people refuse to believe that and think older gaming was just this utopia
            Nostalgia is a hell of a drug
            Survival bias is strong in this one
            Honestly gaming is better now than in 2011 in a lot of ways. Most of today’s shitty practices were already in place but every game was also trying to be literally CoD. Meanwhile, EA was experimenting with ‘Online Passes’ where you’d have to spend an extra $20 access multiplayer if you bought a used copy of the game. Glad those trends are dead. 
        "Man when I go back to this old very popular game that holds up over years, I think why aren't modern games like this?"
        for whatever reason your comment reminded me of this video 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiMyCzezfTg
        Yep. We have the benefit of selecting the best of the best games when looking back at older titles. There were a lot of shitty games too, but if you’re looking at the classics, of course they’re good. 

It’s like playing the hits from the 90s or 80s. There was a lot of bad music, but you don’t hear it because they just aren’t talked about anymore. Same with movies
    You should try the really bad full priced games I had for NES and PS1 lol.

And just this month there is Helldivers 2, Ultros, Balatro, Prince of Persia: Lost Crown, FFVII: Rebirth and Pacific Drive.
    >It’s always depressing for me to play old original games.

That's entirely your fault. Drop the "older is better" bullshit and you'll actually enjoy things. There's absolutely no shortage of great games coming out these days.
    The fourth A stands for Anemic
I assumed this was r/gamingcirclejerk
I wish I could go back and play Portal 1 again for the first time. Blew my mind. I loved Portal 2, don't get me wrong, a friend got it for my birthday and we just sat down and played the co-op until we were done, but 1 was something I'd never played before.
    Check out Portal: Revolution  
It's free.
We really took completed whole quality games for granted back then
The game is awesome, and a Milestone in the industry, but you are somehow doing a weird jump through the loop just to say the game is really good.
It's amazingly timeless. Just played through co-op of Portal 2 with my younger sister too on Switch and it still looks and feels amazing to play.

Was fun seeing her eyes light up when the logic of the mechanics started to come naturally.
It's one of the best game of all time, mainly because it did something new, really well. 

A lot of games are starting to feel "samey" to me. Even big titles like BG3, and Elden Ring.
You must not play much then.
Masterpiece.
"hurr durr new thing bad"
Don’t press the button
Portal to revolution should be free with this on the store as well
Dude that screen protector...
    Ruins the whole look
That's because it's QUALITY!
all the source engine games have aged really well, considering they go for a realistic graphic style (except the and dota obviously)
Oh I only just finished it recently it's so good
I play it once a year. It never gets old and somehow the puzzles are still challenging. We should have had Poral 3 years ago.
Valve makes great games in rare instance that they decide to make a game.
I got the Switch bundle and replayed Portal 1 recently, forgot how great it was. Way excited to replay 2 now that it’s been long enough that I’ve forgotten the puzzles and most of the Cave Johnson lines.
My all time favorite
It’s such a polished experience. Even the graphics still hold up super well all these years later.
It was new back then too
Agreed it’s incredible game.

But there have been lots of incredible games lately in the indie space as well.
This game is a big part of why valve was seen for years as being unable to do any wrong, despite them no longer even making real games. It’s essentially perfect and it’s aged like wine
When you finish find a game called Quantum Conundrum. Similar in gameplay style.
You've grown accustomed to the slop you've been force-fed for the last 10 years.
I hope people are still playing Portal 2 for the first time in like a hundred years. That game is so good.
But Portal 2 is recent, I mean it just came out a few years ago.

Right?
Portal 2 is a triumph in every sense of the word, a wonderful experience from start to finish and one that you won't soon forget. Indeed, this is both mathematical and storytelling art-work; it teams a gripping narrative with an inventive gameplay mechanic that makes for an excellent and unforgettable ride.
oh, please.  Portal 2 is fantastic and it's a timeless classic, but "it feels newer than anything recent"? Video game industry has been on fire lately releasing genre-defining masterpieces.
Then you must not play much recent.

Portal 2 is good (I'd argue better than Portal 1), but there's a lot of shit that's come out since then that feels much newer.
I played portal 1 recently for the first time. I always heard great things about it leading me to check it out. It didn't disappoint and I look forward to the sequel
please tell me what kind of shovelware you are playing for portal 2 to feel new
A masterpiece is timeless
Portal 2 is a timeless classic, anyone should play it, and I personally believe it is the best game to introduce people to fps
What kind of console is that?
I also played both Portal and Portal 2 on Switch last year for the first time. I had read about those games for ages, but the concept looked a bit silly and simplistic to be interested in them in the first place. Anyway, I finally decided that being such classics I should give them a try. First 5 minutes of Portal and I still didn’t get the appeal. But oh boy, it only got better and better. I got hooked and couldn’t stop playing. First thing I did when I finished Portal was starting with Portal 2. Such amazing games, really. I hope that some day I can play those on VR, it would be so cool!
What console is that ?
“Playing a game I’ve never played feels pretty new” op
This game is still good and co op is awesome.  I play it with both my son and wife co op
Sigh…. It pains me it isn’t available on PlayStation also
It's a timeless game. One of the greatest ever..
What I would give to go back and experience that game for the first time once more.
Yet again Valve proving that they are masters of making masterpieces.

Why they stopped making games is a complete mystery to us all (more or less - the answer probably being that sitting back and raking in money from Steam is easy).
OMG first time!  So lucky
I am so jealous of you rn. I wish I could play it for the first time again. Have fun, OP!
I mean you're playing one of the greatest game ever made for the first time. Enjoy it.
...you'll love the first *portal*, then:  it's even better!..
This game is an absolute masterpiece
Creativity ages well.
My fav game of all time.  The ending is phenomenal
This was a triumph
"Ageless" is the perfect word for this game!
That's the Valve polish for you.
Its called polished to a mirror shine and its what separates timeless classics from pop culture phenomenons.
npc post
Best puzzle game ever
MAKE PORTAL 3. PLEASE.
To all: Try playing Portal 1 RTX if your card supports it. Really nice upgrade visually.
I’ve replayed Half-Life 2 a few times and am always amazed at how it hasn’t aged. The way the Source engine works not just for the gravity gun bits but for the simple way the guns feel or the way enemy bodies crumple… no game has been able to match that for me.
Portal and Portal 2 are the best games of all time imo. The og will always hold a special place in my heart because I played it on a whim not knowing what the hell it was and couldnt put it down until it was done.
Ok buddy.
Look at you!  Sailing through the air majestically, like an egal, piloting a blimp.
I have genuine envy. That game is a masterpiece.
i feel like games hit a ridiculous sweet spot back then everything looked and felt crisp while top of the line performance was achievable with high graphics
This man deserves an award for saying the thing.

No game after ~2014 or 2016 feels good or polished or amazing to play anymore.

It's like people stopped caring about making stories and just cared about latest trends and making bank. This marketing scheme of making games sell like hot cakes turns out to be A shit selling stall, they are selling you shitcakes for a high and mighty price for no fucking reason other than: "well they're doing it!"

And that's not even a valid reason.

I want you to understand, pirate as many fucking games that aren't indie, hell, make the bigger game companies miserable, teach them the lesson they deserve!
I was just playing Half Life 2. They have working magnifying glasses, in game physics..

I'm not sure if Valve was ahead of their time or if games have really fell off this hard recently
    It’s hard to overstate how far ahead of its time Half Life 2 was. The physics, graphics, facial animations - lots of the things gamers take for granted now became mainstream because of Half Life 2 and the Source Engine. I’m not saying none of the above existed prior to those games but definitely not all at the same time and not executed as well.
    Its Def both, valve with all the main HL releases are 5+ years ahead of their time. Hl 1, hl 2, hl alyx..
Love Portal 2!

How do you like the rog ally? I've been thinking about getting one of them or a Steam deck, but it's hard to choose!
    I love mine, but I’ll admit there are things about the Steam Deck that are tempting! Really it comes down to do you want more battery life or better power on the ROG. It is a blast to play games handheld in 1080p 60fps though.
        Ok cool, I appreciate your feedback! It seems like it'd be a really nice thing to have a handheld computer (rog) to do what ever you want. Although I am not thrilled about having another Windows machine to mess with. Steam Deck seems pretty clean in its UI.
            I can't recommend the Ally enough. Once you get over the set-up hump, it runs like a charm. It also plays nice with MS Game Pass, which requires a work-around on the Deck.
                I have no doubt, it seems to be a lot more powerful. Which ally do you guys have? The normal or extreme? There looks to be a big jump in cpu
                    It's the extreme. It was $200 off during the holidays; don't know where it sits now.
                        Ah ok, yeah I would go with the extreme but unfortunately it's a 300$ difference right now (400 vs 700)

But I'm thinking I'll go with an Ally Z1 somewhat soon.
        From the other side, I love my OLED deck. The display is fabulous and the battery is better than I thought possible with this level of performance in this form factor. 800p can be kind of ugly in some games but usually it works out ok, I blame the game for not handling resolutions properly (i.e. subnautica reticle looks super ugly, aliased, and kinda square in anything below 1440p, 1080p looks mostly ok but 1440p and above is an actual perfect clean circle, Minecraft has horrible aliasing, especially beta minecraft at 800p, the textures are supposed to be low res sure but good god the shimmering. Ashley in RE4 remaster hair looks like a witch instead of a 20 something year old girl)
Yep, one of the best games ever.
I firmly believe it's the greatest game ever made, from a design, writing and gameplay standpoint. It's not my most favorite game of all time (too in love with Mass Effect) but I think it's the overall best.
The cake is a lie!
That's Valve for you. Their releases stand the test of time.
They pre-rendered shadows.... I believe that is one of the "secrets". I think this only works because it's only you?
I'm 47 and somehow missed playing this when it was new.  I played both through x-mas vacation and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I get the hype now.
Lemons!
The level editor is awesome
Hard to believe it’s 12 years old already
Portal 2 on handheld feels so premium.
Agreed. Especially if you're playing Portal RTX
Mid 2000's Valve.... those were the days
How is it on the Ally? 

I might add it to mine.
A home that's always worth a replay;especially when you can convince a friend to play with
Did a replay recently, blitzed it in about 3 days and would happily give it 11/10 still.
Puzzle games typically have a lot more interesting ideas and concepts. Try playing more and you'll find that they are a lot more inventive than a lot of bigger games being released.
I've been replaying it recently.

With an N64 controller with remapped controls.
I played portal 2 co-op with my son a few days ago. Even I thought at the time, how good this game is. And co-op is a blast.
You can tell a game is a timeless masterpiece when it's still able to compete with modern games.
DirectX 9 had a massively appealing, timeless charm to it. It sure keeps old games feeling fresh and new, even though the API itself is closing in on 25 years old now.

Portal (and Source in general) just happens to be one of the most legendary uses of this excellent API.
I've played this game more times than I'm proud to admit. such a great game!!
The co op is great too if you have someone to play with
The co op campaign is great too if you have someone to play with
The coop mode is really fun !!!
The rog allys color and and design compliment the game as well.  That was a nice pairing.
Something about the environment design is timeless. It does not age.

Half the time, "innovation" just means "catching up to Valve".
Such a supremely well done game. Maybe the greatest puzzle game ever. The fact that it also had a COMPLETELY different co-op campaign with all-new puzzles designed specifically for two players blew my mind as well.
I just downloaded RTX on Portal the other day and am having a blast going back through it after so many years
So good! I hear 2 Player mode is mega fun, but never tried it
What does that even mean lol
What are you playing on?
It's magnificent. My 15yo replays it on the regular.
Good design does not age.
Yesh thats what happens when you play a game that's "new" to you.
One of the industry’s last gasps of air before the age of micro transactions.
Uuuummm it is a new game.

Just looked it up it came out 13 years ago wtf
Portal 2 is such a great time.
If you can get it try Reloaded. Adds a third dimension. Challenging!!
This game is on my short list of Greatest Games of All Time.  Enjoy!
I am so insanely jealous of you. If i have one wish, it would be to play this game for the first time again. I hope you enjoy it!
Instead of “newer” the word I would use to describe the game is “sleek”. Which is because that’s what it’s supposed to look like. Most games take place outside in natural environments, or indoors in manmade structures. But Portal and Portal 2 take place in a hyper-advanced facility run by a genius robot. It makes sense that the facility would look very sleek.

(The game also just had more care put into it than a lot of newer games)
The word you're looking for is "timeless". 

Very few games manage it.
I play through that and portal 1 about once a year. It’s so damn good.
If your able to download mods make sure to try these prequels portal stories mel for portal 2 and portal prelude for portal 1
Valve games are usually top tier. Its too bad they don't seem to really make games anymore.
Whoever owns the Portal franchise, obviously doesn’t like money.

Portal 3 sales would most likely break all records of all time.
It has aged very well, and the co-op is a blast with another person.
Play the co-op maps. They are a ton of fun.
Amazing game! Have fun :)
I love that game so much. And what a bonus to have a completely different campaign for 2 player. My bro and I had a blast figuring out those puzzles together. Miss you bro
Weird looking switch.
Well for something recent I would say try helldivers 2 but seeing as how the servers are co Stanton crushed I would also say, please don’t try helldivers 2.
That's a true masterpiece. We never need a remaster, remake, etc of it. You can just play it anytime.
Ya it’s aging great. A true classic
Wait till you get to the later levels. Once you solve the puzzles it feels amazing to just go.
Cake
Yup. Welcome to the peak gaming era. Enjoy your stay.
Truly ahead of its time. Definitely top 5 for me.

I played through it with a friend who has died since, so I may be a tad rose-tinted.
What other games have you played recently to compare?
Obligatory:

Happy Cake Day
Hope ypu played portal1 before 

Also there is a mod for portal2  which has custom levels and a third portal 
Havnt tried it yet but i hear its good
It's a great game, so is the original. But I haven't replayed it at all. They both seem...like one play and done games because of the puzzles. At least to me...still amazing games though.
Valve has always been ahead of their time. From hardware to software. 

Some ideas flop of course, but the ones that stick, stick for a long time.
Yeah this game has been my number 1 game of all time since it came out. Enjoy an absolute masterpiece :)
The relatively simplistic art design allows it to hold up a lot better than it should.  Same thing goes with Team Fortress 2, which still looks great despite being well over a decade old.
My favorite game ever maybe. Enjoy every line of dialogue and lurk around waiting for different quips it’s worth it.
Some games are timeless classics. Portal 2 is one of them.
Valve really nailed their physics in the source engine. Makes games like this sing.
I’ve had portal 2 for ages in my steam. Was told to play the first one first so I waited. Finally got it on sale for 79 cents once I beat Doom that’s next.
It runs really well on Switch too, even the co-op.
C'mon Valve give us a Half-Life / Half-Life 2 port/remaster!
I wonder if it's the game engine because if that's what they made Titanfall 2 with, It's gotta be some type of impressive.
I played Inside about 3 weeks after I completed Portal 2 and I feel like it addressed the same itch with atmosphere and puzzles, but sorta
“Oh thank god I’m alright, you know being Caroline just taught me a valuable lesson, I thought you’re my greatest enemy but how long you were my best friend. The surge is short through me when I saved your life taught me an even more valuable lesson where Caroline lives in my brain”

“Caroline deleted”

Goodbye Caroline, you know deleting Caroline now taught me a valuable lesson, the best solution to a problem is usually the easiest one and I’ll be honest killing you is hard? You know what my days used to be like? I just tested, nobody murdered me or put me in a potato or fed me to birds. I had a pretty good life but then you showed up you dangerous mute lunatic so you what? You win, just go”

“Laughs” it’s been fun don’t come back”

That game is a timeless, modern classic
The image you see is the equivalent of playing GOW on Xbox.
Know exactly the feeling you're trying to describe. It feels fresh, polished and original. Dunno how to describe it really. Definitely some big brains involved in making it lmao.
Portal 2 just doesn't age. It has been in a state of suspension for 99999999...
Oh boy, I wish I could play it for the first time again. It is a true masterpiece in every aspect
Actually went back to portal 1 and it’s still a masterpiece too. Definite improvements in 2 make it a better game, but for a 2007 launch its incredible
Any valve game feels like it is ahead of its time
One of the best games ever made, an absolutely timeless masterpiece that'll endure the times.

I'm absolutely sure that people will still be playing it in 20 years if not 50.
That's the feeling you get when you play a game that's actually good and innovative, rather than the usual AAA copy/paste slop released today.
This is what happens when you have developers making something they actually WANT to make, and having the budget to make said thing. Downside is, if no one wants to make/work on anything at Valve... they don't make anything.
I'm way out of touch. What are you playing it on?
This next test is very dangerous. To help you remain tranquil in the face of almost certain death, smooth jazz will be deployed, in three, two, one.
Portal 2 is the definitive masterpiece! The peak of Valve single player games (sorry HF2 fans!)
It wasn't THE first, but it was one of the first games to sneakily make you do the Y axis configuration.


In case you missed it's it happens at the start when Wheatley says look up. It sets whichever direction you push the joystick as up. 
The word is "better".
☹️
This is the only game you can run with a potato on a potato
Such a perfect game for the Ally too. It runs great. Jealous that it's your first time.
It's my favorite game of all time, enjoy it
It plays really well on the Switch so you don't need to burn a hole in your pocket just to play it on a steamdeck or ROG ally.
I'm playing it for the first time too on the deck, just completed portal 1 and am currently on chapter 4 or chamber 4 or something.
check out Viewfinder if you like Portal. Portal meets polaroid camera.
Because it's so rare for a new game to be *truly* unique. Not that every game needs to be, but when a game is it becomes very memorable.

Also, people can stop making willfully ignorant comments pretending they don't realize I'm talking about the Portal franchise and not just Portal 2. You're not clever.
    It also picked a graphic style and color palette that never feels dated.  Similar to wind waker and it's cell shaded graphics. Turns out when you only need to make a grungy lab consisting of white walls and portals you can make it rather detailed for 2011.
        It also has amazing voice acting. GladOS, Wheatley, Cave Johnson... so good. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley is so good. 

&nbsp; 

*Most test subjects do experience some cognitive deterioration after a few months in suspension. Now you've been under for... quite a lot longer, and it's not out of the question that you might have a very minor case of serious brain damage. But don't be alarmed, alright? Although, if you do feel alarm, try to hold onto that feeling because that is the proper reaction to being told you have brain damage.*
            I still think my favorite part of the game is Cave Johnson freaking out about how he doesn't want any damn lemons and he's going to make a combustible lemon to burn life's house down.
                After speaking to the manager!
            Say goodnight Carolyn!
                She is a gem.
            I can perfectly hear the dialogue inside my head
        Mirror's Edge(2008) is also pretty timeless in the graphics department. Turns out if the environment is a dystopian white concrete hell you can get away with a lot of graphical shortcuts.
        BoTW, ToTK, Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, and every other 3D Zelda title still takes a back seat to how fucking magical wind waker is. Such a brilliant game.
            Wind Waker really needs a true sequel. I would love a hybrid game of Wind Waker and BoTW where it's an open world sailing Zelda game with crafting and cell shaded graphics.  My one complaint in Wind Waker is how it feels open world but it kind of isn't.  You really go to certain islands in a certain order instead of sailing at random. If they could find a way to make the islands more random and less order mandatory it would be so cool.
                I think that comes down to a limitation of the game cube more than anything. Windwaker carried the style of the 2d games better and was just charming from start to end.
    Well at the same time when there is half of the games release by the main publishers being basically Far Cry / Assasin's Creed or trying to be the next fortnite, obviously there is not lot of originality recently
        Theres also a lot of survivals all of a sudden.
            All of sudden? 

Were u living under a rock for like 10 years?
                Go easy, he's just surviving out here with the rest of us
        > trying to be the next fortnite

This reminded me that the real halo killer was halo all along. :( 

So many console sci-fi shooters trying to be the next "halo killer" but all it took was a dude named Brian Reed to make Halo the "bad guy" when we all knew eh was a pretty cool guy.
            I had a good bit of fun with splitgate. It even had a decent surge of players a bit before the latest halo came out. Basically just halo with portals and it felt nice and pretty fun.
            Wait, what happened, exactly?
                Brian Reed was head story writer on Halo 5 which put the player as a member of Fireteam Osiris (Locke). Players didn't enjoy the story or locke much and people think made them put the main-line halo games to bed in favor of whatever halo infinite is for a while.

He was fired in 2017, btw.
    Are people really commenting to tell you that portal 2 isn’t original and is actually rather derivative of a less known indie game known as Portal, and that you probably never heard of it? Lmfao.
        … [long drag on cigarette]
    I think it also helps that the game isn't focused on human models that the industry is currently trying to jam over to the other side of the uncanny valley.
    Most mainstream games now are the same military/murder simulators over and over again.
        And then you have Spec Ops: The Line
It’s also simultaneously hilarious and heartfelt.  One of the best games of all time.

I often wonder what a VR port would be like and how many times I would throw up playing it.
    There is one! And I can't recommend it enough: [https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr/releases/tag/v0.2.0-preview.1](https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr/releases/tag/v0.2.0-preview.1)

It honestly feels like the game was made for it. You get used to flinging yourself through the air, its surprisingly not *that* sickness inducing ^if ^you ^close ^your ^eyes
        [deleted]
            give it a try if you can. i dont get motion sickness but a weird uncomfortable feeling if a game takes over the camera in unexpected ways and portal felt surprisingly natural. it also immediately snaps you in position when you enter exit the portal without standard animation guess that helps a lot.
if you can handle it it is one of the best gaming experiences there are and way better than it was on a flat screen.
                I recall in an interview, someone at valve said they really looked into doing an official portal vr port, and scrapped it because the vast majority of users got extremely sick no matter how they tried to handle the portal transitions. And it makes sense. I'm sure it's fun if you can handle it, but the main cause of motion sickness in vr is when you appear to be moving without actually moving irl. Can't avoid that when flying through a portal. Surprisingly when I first got the original rift *years* ago, when I'd have people try it, almost nobody could stomach Google earth vr because you are flying around.
    There's a mod for vr.
Fun fact: We're closer to Portal 2's 25th anniversary than we are to its release.
    No it isn’t. 
Checks release date. 
Damnit.
    Orange box came out 17 years ago. 

Fuck.
        still probably the best value in terms of game quality to $$ that I've ever spent though
            HL2 + episodes, TF2, and Portal for 60 bucks? Absolute steal, was my first time getting to experience any half life, as well.
                I bought years later in 2014 for like 25 CAD on PS3, and everything in it still felt brand new.
                    I never even knew it had a PS3 release, that's pretty neat
                50 on steam akshully
    I don’t care what the facts say, you’re wrong
    That is not fun.
    What!? Im 28 and i swear portal 2 came out when i was like 10. Crazy
You can't just say shit like "25th anniversary" so casually what the hell. This game only came out 5 years ago and it still will have 20 years from now.

        Maybe they meant the PlayStation Portal? Could have gotten their handhelds mixed up
            I could maybe see that if the portal looked high tech, it technically is but not so much in relation to all other devices nowadays

            I will never forget the first time I heard this line. My then-GF and I absolutely lost our shit, had to pause play while we wiped tears away.
        “I’ve been really busy being dead. You know, after you murdered me?”
            "You did what?? Gah!"
                "Okay look, we've both said a lot of things that you're going to regret."
                    "But I think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster."
                        "You know, since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really love to test. I love it too. There's just one thing we need to take care of first.."
                        "I will say, though, you must really, really love to test. I love it too. There's just one thing we need to take care of first..."
                    This is the line. This is the one that's my favorite in the game.
            I think my favourite is the fat shaming reads. 

"Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds."
                The best one was from the co-op mode:

"Did you know humans frown on weight variances? If you want to upset a human, just say that their weight variance is above or below the norm."
                Look at you, sailing through the air majestically. Like an Eagle. Piloting a blimp.
It really is a combustable lemon of a game
    Take the damn lemons back!
"All right, I’ve been thinking. When live gives you lemons? Don’t make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! ‘I don’t want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these?’ Demand to see life’s manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I’m the man who’s going to burn your house down! With the lemons! I’m going to get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down! “ - Cave Johnson
    “Goodbye Mr Johnson.”
    Burning people! He said what we're all thinking!
FEELS GUILTY NOT BEING IN SPAAAACE !!!!!
A triumph if you will
    yeah fr, someone should make a note here, this is a huge success
        It's honestly hard to overstate my satisfaction with the game
            I mean you in apature science after all, you do what you must because you can.
                Its for the good of all of us, after all. Except the ones who are dead. They would be fine with it.
                    Yeah there's truly no sense crying over every mistake.
                        Personally, I think the other game companies need to keep trying til they run out of (metaphorical) cake
                            And the games will get done and they'll make some neat fun for the players who are still alive
                                I'm not even angry about this chain of puns
    For Science
        You monster 
    I'll make a note, huge success.
        You are a terrible person, it says so right here. Terrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
    I see what you did there. It almost feels like 2009 again
    I will
    This was a triumph
That's why it's in MoMA's collection.
The trolling you can do to a friend is top notch.
The whole lead up to it with the Potato Sack was super fun too.  Having to play through a level of Amnesia to get a fucking potato, however, was not.
Same, especially the coop because then I could play it with different people without knowing all the solutions which kinda ruins it.
    I tried to play the coop with my nephew last year. I had never played it before but he's played it many times. It very quickly became unfun as he proceeded to rush through all the solutions while I was still trying to figure them out.
        Yea I mean that's on your nephew but can't really blame him. When I played with people I sat back and let them take the lead. I would only gently guide them if they got stuck
            We quickly realized neither of us were having fun and played something else instead haha
        This was my 1st experience in co-op with a rando. They actually started berating me because I didn't know what to do as soon as we walked into a room. I had already beat the sp so I uninstalled. Couple years later my son was born. We beat co-op together last year, he was 9. It was incredible.
    Portal 2 has my favourite co-op puzzle of all time, the one where the exit is directly in the middle of two angled portal platforms that launch you way over the middle so it seems impossible to land there. Where the solution is >!that both players have to go through at the same time and collide in mid-air to stall your jump!<.

It's the one puzzle I absolutely refuse to give any hints on if I'm playing it with someone new, because it's such a satisfying solution to arrive at yourself.
        That one is brilliant!

My sister and I were trying to solve it for ages, then she had to leave. An hour or so later the solution flashed into my brain and I had to confirm it! But nobody else was around. So I somehow managed to use both controllers at once and still get Atlas and Peabody to slam into each other! Even bigger success!

Solo dual-controller triumph?
    If you are on PC, there are hundreds of fantastic custom made co-op levels available through steam workshop.
        and thousands of terrible ones too!
    Me and a buddy pretty much played all the community maps there were. There are some really fun challenges on there that border on masochism. So much fun to be had there.
Holy shit same
Same, I was *over the moon* for that one moment near the end that I don't want to spoil. I wish I could experience it with a fresh mind.
    God the whole build up leading to you figuring out that last puzzle in the climax was a masterful blending of story and puzzle you don't really see elsewhere
        So much of that game was masterfully crafted. There’s a moment where you are bouncing on some gel and having a conversation with Wheatley in the rafters every time you hit the apex of the jump and it is SO naturally and perfectly comedically timed I still don’t think I’ve been quite so entertained by a game since
        Yeah, and fun fact, I'll keep it vague but you'll know, the developers actually took the time to code in the impulse for the portal gun, all through the game it's effectively instant, it's going the speed of light, but the distance from you to the wall is close enough that instant is fine. But for one particular shot, the distance is exactly how long it would *really* take to reach the target. There is a noticable pause, and that pause is ***accurate.***
And the first Portal game...
    And the third Portal game... oh wait
        Portal Revolution came out recently and it was absolutely superb
Check out "Portal Stories: Mel" and "Portal Revolution" on Steam. You're welcome.
As someone with a ps5, I wish I could just play it again.
    It has very low requirements, if you have a computer it can probably run it.
I waited maybe 7 years between playthroughs, and it felt as close to new as I could've probably hoped for.
We're just throwin' science at the wall to see what sticks.
    The science boys haven't nailed down what element it is yet, but we do know it's a lively one and it DOES NOT like the human skeleton
        Those of you who volunteered to be injected with praying mantis DNA, I've got some good news and some bad news. Bad news is we're postponing those tests indefinitely. Good news is we've got a much better test for you: fighting an army of mantis men. Pick up a rifle and follow the yellow line.
            You’ll know when the test starts.
                I can hear this comment thread

    Unfortunately cave forgot that lemons are a human created hybrid fruit. Life didn’t give us lemons, we gave ourselves lemons.
        [Now in 40k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNEzD5n6SAs).
His whole perpetual testing initiative dialogue is the best thing they could have done, and I love it.
    It's a shame not as many people realize there is another half hour of cave dialog
        Those of you who volunteered to be injected with praying mantis DNA, I've got some good news and some bad news. Bad news is we're postponing those tests indefinitely. Good news is we've got a much better test for you: fighting an army of mantis men. Pick up a rifle and follow the yellow line.
        Where? Is it hidden or something?
Love JK Simmons's performance/voice here.
    "Sorry fellas she's married....to science!!"
When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade!! get mad! I dont want your damn lemons! demand to see life's manager! Do you know who I am?!? I'm the man who's gonna' burn your house down! with the lemons!
    "Yeah! oh I like this guy. He says what we're all thinking."
Jk Simmons can do no wrong
    I just watched Whiplash recently, and the part where he says "I can still see you, Mini-Me!" made me instantly think of how Cave Johnson berates his employees
The GOAT of NPC's.
One of my favorite characters in anything
I’ve been having a BLAST playing around with the Cave Johnson GPT ai 🤣😭🤣😭 it’s literally *perfect*
    Wait what? Does it speak in his voice or just respond in Cave Johnson mannerisms? Is it just regular ol chat gpt or did someone make something portal related?
        I have no clue how it’s made, but I know that not all Cave Johnson GPTs are created equally. Some are simply fed a transcript, but the one by Jon McCumber (the one I like most) is more like the real deal and it’s not just a parrot reading lines like the other ones. No voices, but it’s so on-point that none are needed lol honestly 🤣

Ask him about flat earth, or about other caves from parallel universes no matter how whacky it may seem, send him a screenshot of a meme, anything you do with the man is just… chef’s kiss 😚
[All the Cave Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJnIpCu1JBM) you can get, including the alternate reality ones.
Fun fact: he's voiced by the yellow M&M
I’m glad I picked it up because I can already tell it’s quality is off the charts.
    Back when games were completed before they hit the market
        And when they added stuff, it felt like stuff that deserved to get tacked on and made the game better as opposed to something that should have been there before.  The co-OP chambers and perpetual testing initiative make a great game better.
        why are you acting like that doesn't happen? you're looking in the wrong place if it does
            It happens, but goddamn is the ratio dipping down lately
        It even released early because we powered up GLaDOS with potatoes.
        Nah they were definitely unfinished buggy messes that just never got fixed or only got fixed in rereleases. 

“It’s not a bug itsa feature” followed bethesda way before skyrim was released. 

Theres a few final fantasy bosses in specific versions of the games you cant face in certain orders without crashign the game.

First two gens of pokemon were held together with paperclips and prayers. 

It’s just more common now due to volume + complexity + ability to fix as needed. Which the third one is a big negative, but even ignoring that wed still see more just cause of volume + complexity.
        Hoooly shit ppl just willfully ignore the past like 30 years of shovelware. There have always been shittily produced games, and yet the vast majority of non live-service titles even in recent years have been released in a complete state (and even many of those have a solid base release experience).
        Seriously. This makes me look at all the recent stuff coming out half baked with even more disdain.
Source engine is amazing, it still feels so good after all this time
    Too many developers allow player movement and responsiveness in input to be a low priority. 

People who didn't grow up on the quake 1/2/3 and goldsource engines straight up don't understand how snappy and responsive everything was back in the day.

Most modern shooters feel like you're moving around on iceskates and aiming input has a subtle lag that just feels *off* compared to the older engines.

Valve feels like one of the only companies that really put player movement and input as a top priority, and built the engine out from that as a baseline.
        It's true across genres, too. I don't play MMOs anymore but when I did, the thing that kept WoW on top despite its questionable expansions and other issues was its movement and responsiveness. Outside of server latency, you press W and you move forward. You cast a spell and it casts. I tried others and it felt like animation quality took precedent over player control and "feel".
            Yeah, i think a big contributor to it is having momentum in the player as a variable, where you accelerate and decelerate with movement. It's usually pretty subtle, but makes the 'floaty' feeling of a lot of games very noticeable.
        This is why TF2 has not only managed to survive despite not getting any new content for 6 years but has actually grown.
        all the modern games try to feel "realistic" in their movements. I fucking hate it. It's why battlefield bad company 2 was so good and battlefield 3 after it sucked. its why GTA 5 sucks with the floppy fucking movements. Devs are forgetting were playing video games and dont want to feel rEAliSm in how our magic face melting characters move
The writing, art style, controls, gameplay, that ENDING. 

It might actually be the best made game.
    God, that moment when it clicks in your head how you beat the final boss, that you have to >!shoot a portal at the fucking moon!<, that's genuinely one of the coolest moments in any video game I've played. My jaw was on the floor
        Absolutely one of the best player executed story moments in gaming!
            I love all the moments leading up to it. Mentions of moon rocks and moon dust and whatnot all over the place. Even if you paid zero attention to any of the dialogue the game makes it so explicit that white surface is portal-able and black isn’t. Then comes the final cutscene, the moon, glowing white, contrasted by the pitch black night sky. Nothing needs to be said, it just clicks. Magnificent finale.
                ...and the best thing is that it came out of a scrapped easter egg. There was supposed to be a visible moon near the beginning of the game, and if you placed a portal there you would get sucked in, die and get a fake ending with a song and credits rolling (I believe that was the original purpose of Exile Vilify in the game). However, they couldn't figure out how to end the battle with Wheatley in a satisfying way for quite a long time and in the end they scrapped the fake endings concept and just reused the one with the moon for the boss fight.
                Valve has always been amazing at keeping small details in their games that just make their environments feel so alive. Playing half life 2 feels more lifelike than a lot of AAA environments. Not to mention half life alyx which is just fucking beautiful
                Valve is exceptional at guiding the player without outright telling them what to do. The developer commentary for Portal 1 shows just how much thought goes into everything they make you do. Throwing the companion cube in the furnace is actually a small tutorial for doing the same thing to the cores during GLaDOS’ boss fight.
        A neat thing about that is how it's setup so there are only two places where you can have portals, one being by the button so you're all ready to do it, but placing the final portal triggers the end of the game even if you use the wrong one
    FUN FACT: Voice actor for Glados sang the ending opera
        FUN FACT: Voice actor for GLaDOS is married to the voice actor of Sniper from TF2.
            FUN FACT: The voice actor for GLaDOS is also the voice actor for the Administrator in Team Fortress 2, the Combine Overwatch in Half-Life 2, Brood Mother and Death Prophet in Dota 2, and the Witch in Left 4 Dead 2 (and 1).
                I'm having so much fun right now
        Ellen McLain is wonderful
        GlaDOS was also the computer's voice in Gypsy Danger in Pacific Rim. Guillermo del Toro did that on purpose because of Ellen McLain's voice work in the Portal games.
        FUN FACT: The voice of Glados is the same voice used in Pacific Rim for the Jaeger AI
    speaking of the ending...I can't explain why, but I will never fail to be moved by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90iFStSMnH4) someone made of an animation of Chell outside feeling the rain after escaping, while rain sounds play along with Exile Vilify (the song The National contibuted to the Portal 2 soundtrack).

it provokes an emotion I don't even know how to describe.  maybe not as moving to others as it is to me, but just wanted to share it.
        I loved so many of the Portal user created videos for that song.
    BEEEEEWOOOOOOOoooooo^ooooooo ..... 

****ding!****
HL Alyx up there too
    Alyx has ruined VR for me. Nothing else gets even remotely close and it really feels like Valve is the only studio who actually seriously gave a shit about putting out a AAA VR title.

Its not my favorite game, but it was absolutely 100% the best singleplayer gaming experience ive had. ever.
        Alyx exists because of the intersection of two things... Two things that intersect nowhere else in the gaming industry:

1. Game developer has virtually infinite money.

2. Game developer is privately owned and has no obligation to shareholders to attempt to turn a profit on their game.

Valve is the only company that can make a AAA+ quality game for a tiny audience.
            I'd say a couple more:

- Game developer is a major player in VR tech
- Game developer has IP with an engine that works in VR
        Dark souls ruined most pancake games for me, Alyx ruined most Vr games lol.
            I sold my headset a couple months after i put down Alyx for this very reason. I'll come back to VR in a couple years, at the very least just to play Alyx again.
        Yeah nothing really compares to the level of HL Alyx in the VR space. It was meant to be a launch title but years later it's still far and away the best title on VR.. and it's not even close. 

The problem with AAA VR games is two fold:

- they are expensive and technically challenging to make. 
- VR users are just a fraction of the PC gaming market... which itself is just a subset of the overall gaming market. 

So unfortunately AAA studios rather put their time and money into projects that support a wider audience instead of a niche one, which is a shame. They figure the juice isn't worth the squeeze.

This is also why you hardly ever see VR games go on sale.

I'm hoping VR becomes a little more mainstream especially now that Apple has gotten in it (kinda), but who knows. It may just remain this way for quite some time.
    Not that most people would know.
        It's sad that barely any people play alyx, because it's a VR game, it didn't sell that bad because it incentivized people to buy VR sets but it was for a less wider audience
    I stand by this. Portal 2 was the best game I'd ever played until I played Half-Life: Alyx. I wish more people would play it, it was shocking to not hear a ton of discussion about it when it released, simply because so few people have a VR headset. I've never had a game hit me like that game did, especially the ending.
        It will be like Portal, playable 10 years from now and still feel new. Mostly because it's still the king of VR and it's been years :(
            Nobody else has Valve money to do absolutely anything they want, even knowing it’ll never make a cent of profit.
                So Microsoft now has less money than Valve? Did they spend it all on game companies again?
                    Microsoft want to make profits, they don’t make games for the love of making amazing groundbreaking games. Alyx was valve saying look we can do with VR.
                        It really is such a refreshing thing to deal with valves mindset on business compared to most others, with valve they're so confident in steam and their other high profit products that they decide to do stuff that is new and exciting every once in a while knowing it will probably lose money.

Compare that to really any other major company in gaming and its obvious. There's a sense of desperation in getting *everything* to make major profits, and if it's not doing that and can't be made to do that then it gets tossed to the wayside.
                Valve literally says they make half life games to show off new tech
        Alyx was a life changer.
            100%.  There's literally nothing else like it.
                One of the best games I've ever played and I can't finish it because I'm scared to pick up the flashlight
                    Dude, I was in the area with the flashlight and some headcrabs and my cat brushed past my leg.  I literally screamed.
        [deleted]
            Quest 3 and apple vr just came out within the last 4 months??
And if you have a pc capable of it you can play alyx plenty well on the quest
                [deleted]
I'm in the same boat. There are a lot of games that aren't my favorite, or that I even like but just playing it is like...this is some gourmet shit. 
I like the first one more, it's more 'subtle'. And I like the atmosphere of not knowing what's going on and feeling kinda isolated even though that nice robot lady talks to you.   
In Portal 2 the setting is immediatly made clear and there is almost always some sort of companion with you, either Wheatly or the Glatato.
I'd say go for Portal Stories Mel. It's a mod but it's on the steam store.
    Portal: Revolution should also be great. i think i'm going to try that one now.
        I thought it was even better than Mel.
        it's pretty much the exact same with a few extra mechanics. super fun though and very true to the original.
Talos Principle 1 is worthwhile just to set up the amazing world in the sequel. The puzzles are top-tier and the writing is worthwhile, though it's heavily philosophical and not comedic.   


The Witness is also a brilliant first person puzzle game, overall it may be more difficult than Portal 2, and definitely the most cryptic of any of the above.
    Man, I loved the Talos Principle.  And now I've discovered there's a sequel.  Thanks!
        and the entire sequel is drop dead gorgeous
    The Witness got tedious fast for me. I remember going through the first sets of puzzles and then searching how long the average playthrough was and immediately stopping when I realized I'd be doing 17+ hours of these puzzles lol.
    Oh yeah, the Witness is amazing. Beautiful game. Sound design is top-notch. My only complaint is the >!birdsong puzzles. Ugh. I knew what I had to do, I just couldn't pick out the audio for the longer ones and had to look up the answers.!<
        Hah, that's funny. The eureka moment of figuring that one out was one of the game's highlights for me.
    As an avid puzzle enjoyer these games are all in my top 10, but The Witness holds the spot as my favourite game of all time.  
  
To start with I thought the puzzle format would get tedious, but it never did. On paper, it's all just line puzzles, but the inventive ways they manage to use that limited format throughout the game is incredible.  
    
More than anything through I just love the vibes of the game. A vibrant, colourful, mysterious, slightly lonely and melancholy feeling island with god knows how many things and places to poke around in and discover.   
     
People say this a lot, but I truly mean it when I say I wish I could wipe my memory of The Witness and replay it. Because one of my favourite aspects of the game inherently leaves it with almost no replay value, unfortunately.
From a puzzle standpoint yes. From a writing standpoint? Absolutely not.


Edit: my comment was vastly misunderstood by some. Im not saying the writing of Talos is bad. Im saying its tough to recommend Talos from a writing perspective because they are SO different. 


If what you loved about Portal was the puzzles youll for sure love Talos. If what you loved was the writing, its a big toss up if youll love Talos.
    You really cannot compare. Portal is like a thriller movie while the Talos Principles is like a philosophy book. They also have different narrative designs but you could see that they both take a lot of effort.
    Talos 2 is like the jump from Portal 1 to Portal 2 story-wise. Its a fleshed out world with a pretty complete story.
        I'm just now learning there is a Talos 2. I absolutely loved the the first game. I'm so excited to get home from work tonight!
        I thought Talos 1 was a beautiful game when I played it on launch and again in 2019. Booted up Talos 2 on a 7900 XTX and i'm absolutely blown away by how detailed the UE5 environments are.

I kept looking down at my character's feet because the ground was covered in high-fidelity, fully modelled grass, pebbles, leaves, twigs, logs etc. that were all casting shadows! I really hope it secures some DLC.
    Talos Principle writing is solid - it’s just not comedy genre. Apples and oranges.
        Apples and Lemons*
            What, did life just give you lemons? I think you know what to do with them if you played Portal 2.
                Burn down life's house with the lemons!
                Turn them into incendiary grenades?
            “I don’t want your damn lemons!”
    The writing in the Talos Principle is stellar imo.
    Did someone avoid reading all the lore pieces in Talos? The writing is top tier. Of course the narrative and storytell are way different.
        I didnt say talos was bad. I meant that if you love puzzles talos fills that void wonderfully. 


But if you loved the writing of portal its not a garuntee to fill that void with Talos.


Its a great game but fills vastly different types of storytelling 
            Fair enough, buddy!
    I understand that some people really enjoy the writing and philosophy and lore in the Talos Principle. I sort of liked it in the first one... but I find myself skipping through all the diologue and lore and junk in the Talos Principle 2. It's a bit much. I wanna solve puzzles, not ponder the universe.
And after that, Anti-Chamber!
    If you like Antichamber, you might also like Manifold Garden.
I would also recommend *The Stanley Parable*.
    I would also recommend *Doom Eternal.*
    I will add Supraland. It's a bit different than the others but is a *very* solid puzzle game.
        Lol definitely a way better fit than The Stanley Parable. And not enough people have played it. The puzzles are so good.
        other puzzle game recommendations:  
ViewFinder (not that difficult, but creative)  
Superliminal  
Cocoon
    Great game.

The day I finally got to play it after the 5 year break was incredible.
    Friendly reminder about the "don't play for 5 years" or whatever achievement, for those who may have started trying to get that one!
Personally The Witness gave me more of that feeling
    If you haven't check out Taiji. It's a 2D Witness.

On that note, the current Humble Bundle has a "mindbending masterpieces" sale that has Taiji, The Witness, The Talos Principle, Manifold Garden, Superliminal, Patrick's Parabox and The Pedestrian for about $20.

https://www.humblebundle.com/games/mindbending-masterpieces
[Portal Revolution](https://store.steampowered.com/app/601360/Portal_Revolution/) came out (free) recently and it's freaking awesome too.
The story is way massive than Portal, but the puzzles are great
Also try: 
Light matter,
The entropy center
I second the Talos Principle. Also, in case anyone missed it the Talos Principle is FULL of hidden content/easter eggs. Worth going back if you missed them.
I played it for about 45 minutes about half a year ago, but found it a bit to cryptic. I couldn't really connect with the story presented at that point, and I found the puzzles a bit boring and repetetive.

Would you say the game gets better over time, or does the beginning give a good enough impression of the game to be able to tell if you like it or not.
    Imo, the game improves over time but if you really hated the first level it just might not be your game. I will also say that it is probably my favourite puzzle game of all time tho...
    I'd say completing the first world is enough to understand  whether you want to continue. The puzzles definitely get more variety when you unlock new puzzle elements, but the story is not spoonfed like in Portal. You can complete the game and remain oblivious to the story. It's for those people that like exploration and discovery.
And then after that portal stories mel. And then after that Portal Prelude. And then after that...
    Please! Give me more! I'm almost done with Revolution and I'm sad I'll be out of new content.
        Try Portal Reloaded
Play Portal Stories: Mel! It's everything you liked about Revolution, except with much harder puzzles, 3x the runtime, and a truly absurd amount of environmental detail. The levels are seriously prettier/better designed than a lot of Portal 2.
Grabbed one last week and being able to play FFXIV (with plugins!), Yakuza, GW2, most emulators because it's just Windows, etc. from my couch is so nice. Not feeling tethered to my desk my entire day between work and gaming is a godsend.
Competition in PC handhelds.  And both can pretty much play anything. Life is good.
And quite a bit more powerful if you’re willing to compromise on battery life
    And instant suspend
        And a proper update schedule that won’t bone you when you’re trying to just relax and play video games
    And instant suspend
    I almost never play mine not plugged in. 30w turbo mode FTW.
    Fr, I love my rog, but the battery doesn’t last me more than 4-5 hours even with some settings I stg💀

FYI: Usual lifespan is ~2 hours
Thank god, I hate parallel dimensions. Never anywhere good to eat.
Love mine. Bought the extreme chip, should be good for a couple years. I did have to send it in for them to fix the sd card slot though.
You'd probably like Cocoon, from same dude as Limbo+Inside.
Portal 1 is the goat. Every puzzle has multiple solutions, a player's creativity and ingenuity really shines here and there's an actual reason to go back and replay it. Portal 2 has great voice actors and dialogue lines and from a linear story perspective it's very engaging and memorable, but from a purely gameplay perspective every puzzle has exactly 1 solution. Once you've found it out there's nothing more to do but move on. Almost no replayability once you've beaten it.
    Exactly my problem with Portal 2. It's a better game than 1, but it's a worse puzzle game.
        1 >>>>>> 2 in every way imo

"We both said a lot of things that you’re going to regret.” - GLaDOS
It's a great game. But to say it's ~~more fluid~~ better than recent games is definitely a take.
    Graphically better? Hell no. But why can’t a game be someone’s personal favorite just because it’s old?
    [deleted]
        Yeah. I like the game, but saying it's the best of all time just ignores the innovation and advances made to future games.
People in here going mad about the writing and Cave Johnson's character, when everything he fucking says is basically an angry man screaming the "holds up spork" monologue.
They're of the same camp that has spent $60 each on the last ~3 AAA titles that they were hammered over the head with and therefore have concluded all current games are bad.

It's a sentiment that never goes away, but it's slightly more popular right now for some reason. Probably because some kids got burned at Christmas? I don't know.
There were shitty games back then too
    unfortunately, people refuse to believe that and think older gaming was just this utopia
        Nostalgia is a hell of a drug
        Survival bias is strong in this one
        Honestly gaming is better now than in 2011 in a lot of ways. Most of today’s shitty practices were already in place but every game was also trying to be literally CoD. Meanwhile, EA was experimenting with ‘Online Passes’ where you’d have to spend an extra $20 access multiplayer if you bought a used copy of the game. Glad those trends are dead. 
    "Man when I go back to this old very popular game that holds up over years, I think why aren't modern games like this?"
    for whatever reason your comment reminded me of this video 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiMyCzezfTg
    Yep. We have the benefit of selecting the best of the best games when looking back at older titles. There were a lot of shitty games too, but if you’re looking at the classics, of course they’re good. 

It’s like playing the hits from the 90s or 80s. There was a lot of bad music, but you don’t hear it because they just aren’t talked about anymore. Same with movies
You should try the really bad full priced games I had for NES and PS1 lol.

And just this month there is Helldivers 2, Ultros, Balatro, Prince of Persia: Lost Crown, FFVII: Rebirth and Pacific Drive.
>It’s always depressing for me to play old original games.

That's entirely your fault. Drop the "older is better" bullshit and you'll actually enjoy things. There's absolutely no shortage of great games coming out these days.
The fourth A stands for Anemic
Check out Portal: Revolution  
It's free.
Ruins the whole look
It’s hard to overstate how far ahead of its time Half Life 2 was. The physics, graphics, facial animations - lots of the things gamers take for granted now became mainstream because of Half Life 2 and the Source Engine. I’m not saying none of the above existed prior to those games but definitely not all at the same time and not executed as well.
Its Def both, valve with all the main HL releases are 5+ years ahead of their time. Hl 1, hl 2, hl alyx..
I love mine, but I’ll admit there are things about the Steam Deck that are tempting! Really it comes down to do you want more battery life or better power on the ROG. It is a blast to play games handheld in 1080p 60fps though.
    Ok cool, I appreciate your feedback! It seems like it'd be a really nice thing to have a handheld computer (rog) to do what ever you want. Although I am not thrilled about having another Windows machine to mess with. Steam Deck seems pretty clean in its UI.
        I can't recommend the Ally enough. Once you get over the set-up hump, it runs like a charm. It also plays nice with MS Game Pass, which requires a work-around on the Deck.
            I have no doubt, it seems to be a lot more powerful. Which ally do you guys have? The normal or extreme? There looks to be a big jump in cpu
                It's the extreme. It was $200 off during the holidays; don't know where it sits now.
                    Ah ok, yeah I would go with the extreme but unfortunately it's a 300$ difference right now (400 vs 700)

But I'm thinking I'll go with an Ally Z1 somewhat soon.
    From the other side, I love my OLED deck. The display is fabulous and the battery is better than I thought possible with this level of performance in this form factor. 800p can be kind of ugly in some games but usually it works out ok, I blame the game for not handling resolutions properly (i.e. subnautica reticle looks super ugly, aliased, and kinda square in anything below 1440p, 1080p looks mostly ok but 1440p and above is an actual perfect clean circle, Minecraft has horrible aliasing, especially beta minecraft at 800p, the textures are supposed to be low res sure but good god the shimmering. Ashley in RE4 remaster hair looks like a witch instead of a 20 something year old girl)
It also picked a graphic style and color palette that never feels dated.  Similar to wind waker and it's cell shaded graphics. Turns out when you only need to make a grungy lab consisting of white walls and portals you can make it rather detailed for 2011.
    It also has amazing voice acting. GladOS, Wheatley, Cave Johnson... so good. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley is so good. 

&nbsp; 

*Most test subjects do experience some cognitive deterioration after a few months in suspension. Now you've been under for... quite a lot longer, and it's not out of the question that you might have a very minor case of serious brain damage. But don't be alarmed, alright? Although, if you do feel alarm, try to hold onto that feeling because that is the proper reaction to being told you have brain damage.*
        I still think my favorite part of the game is Cave Johnson freaking out about how he doesn't want any damn lemons and he's going to make a combustible lemon to burn life's house down.
            After speaking to the manager!
        Say goodnight Carolyn!
            She is a gem.
        I can perfectly hear the dialogue inside my head
    Mirror's Edge(2008) is also pretty timeless in the graphics department. Turns out if the environment is a dystopian white concrete hell you can get away with a lot of graphical shortcuts.
    BoTW, ToTK, Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, and every other 3D Zelda title still takes a back seat to how fucking magical wind waker is. Such a brilliant game.
        Wind Waker really needs a true sequel. I would love a hybrid game of Wind Waker and BoTW where it's an open world sailing Zelda game with crafting and cell shaded graphics.  My one complaint in Wind Waker is how it feels open world but it kind of isn't.  You really go to certain islands in a certain order instead of sailing at random. If they could find a way to make the islands more random and less order mandatory it would be so cool.
            I think that comes down to a limitation of the game cube more than anything. Windwaker carried the style of the 2d games better and was just charming from start to end.
Well at the same time when there is half of the games release by the main publishers being basically Far Cry / Assasin's Creed or trying to be the next fortnite, obviously there is not lot of originality recently
    Theres also a lot of survivals all of a sudden.
        All of sudden? 

Were u living under a rock for like 10 years?
            Go easy, he's just surviving out here with the rest of us
    > trying to be the next fortnite

This reminded me that the real halo killer was halo all along. :( 

So many console sci-fi shooters trying to be the next "halo killer" but all it took was a dude named Brian Reed to make Halo the "bad guy" when we all knew eh was a pretty cool guy.
        I had a good bit of fun with splitgate. It even had a decent surge of players a bit before the latest halo came out. Basically just halo with portals and it felt nice and pretty fun.
        Wait, what happened, exactly?
            Brian Reed was head story writer on Halo 5 which put the player as a member of Fireteam Osiris (Locke). Players didn't enjoy the story or locke much and people think made them put the main-line halo games to bed in favor of whatever halo infinite is for a while.

He was fired in 2017, btw.
Are people really commenting to tell you that portal 2 isn’t original and is actually rather derivative of a less known indie game known as Portal, and that you probably never heard of it? Lmfao.
    … [long drag on cigarette]
I think it also helps that the game isn't focused on human models that the industry is currently trying to jam over to the other side of the uncanny valley.
Most mainstream games now are the same military/murder simulators over and over again.
    And then you have Spec Ops: The Line
There is one! And I can't recommend it enough: [https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr/releases/tag/v0.2.0-preview.1](https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr/releases/tag/v0.2.0-preview.1)

It honestly feels like the game was made for it. You get used to flinging yourself through the air, its surprisingly not *that* sickness inducing ^if ^you ^close ^your ^eyes
    [deleted]
        give it a try if you can. i dont get motion sickness but a weird uncomfortable feeling if a game takes over the camera in unexpected ways and portal felt surprisingly natural. it also immediately snaps you in position when you enter exit the portal without standard animation guess that helps a lot.
if you can handle it it is one of the best gaming experiences there are and way better than it was on a flat screen.
            I recall in an interview, someone at valve said they really looked into doing an official portal vr port, and scrapped it because the vast majority of users got extremely sick no matter how they tried to handle the portal transitions. And it makes sense. I'm sure it's fun if you can handle it, but the main cause of motion sickness in vr is when you appear to be moving without actually moving irl. Can't avoid that when flying through a portal. Surprisingly when I first got the original rift *years* ago, when I'd have people try it, almost nobody could stomach Google earth vr because you are flying around.
There's a mod for vr.
No it isn’t. 
Checks release date. 
Damnit.
Orange box came out 17 years ago. 

Fuck.
    still probably the best value in terms of game quality to $$ that I've ever spent though
        HL2 + episodes, TF2, and Portal for 60 bucks? Absolute steal, was my first time getting to experience any half life, as well.
            I bought years later in 2014 for like 25 CAD on PS3, and everything in it still felt brand new.
                I never even knew it had a PS3 release, that's pretty neat
            50 on steam akshully
I don’t care what the facts say, you’re wrong
That is not fun.
What!? Im 28 and i swear portal 2 came out when i was like 10. Crazy
Wat?

    Maybe they meant the PlayStation Portal? Could have gotten their handhelds mixed up
        I could maybe see that if the portal looked high tech, it technically is but not so much in relation to all other devices nowadays

    Who would program a bot to do... this?
        Half the comment sections are bots posting these days. It's weird as fuck.

"It's been a *long* time. How have you been?"

        I will never forget the first time I heard this line. My then-GF and I absolutely lost our shit, had to pause play while we wiped tears away.
    “I’ve been really busy being dead. You know, after you murdered me?”
        "You did what?? Gah!"
            "Okay look, we've both said a lot of things that you're going to regret."
                "But I think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster."
                    "You know, since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really love to test. I love it too. There's just one thing we need to take care of first.."
                    "I will say, though, you must really, really love to test. I love it too. There's just one thing we need to take care of first..."
                This is the line. This is the one that's my favorite in the game.
        I think my favourite is the fat shaming reads. 

"Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds."
            The best one was from the co-op mode:

"Did you know humans frown on weight variances? If you want to upset a human, just say that their weight variance is above or below the norm."
            Look at you, sailing through the air majestically. Like an Eagle. Piloting a blimp.
Take the damn lemons back!
“Goodbye Mr Johnson.”
Burning people! He said what we're all thinking!
yeah fr, someone should make a note here, this is a huge success
    It's honestly hard to overstate my satisfaction with the game
        I mean you in apature science after all, you do what you must because you can.
            Its for the good of all of us, after all. Except the ones who are dead. They would be fine with it.
                Yeah there's truly no sense crying over every mistake.
                    Personally, I think the other game companies need to keep trying til they run out of (metaphorical) cake
                        And the games will get done and they'll make some neat fun for the players who are still alive
                            I'm not even angry about this chain of puns
For Science
    You monster 
I'll make a note, huge success.
    You are a terrible person, it says so right here. Terrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
I see what you did there. It almost feels like 2009 again
I will
This was a triumph
I tried to play the coop with my nephew last year. I had never played it before but he's played it many times. It very quickly became unfun as he proceeded to rush through all the solutions while I was still trying to figure them out.
    Yea I mean that's on your nephew but can't really blame him. When I played with people I sat back and let them take the lead. I would only gently guide them if they got stuck
        We quickly realized neither of us were having fun and played something else instead haha
    This was my 1st experience in co-op with a rando. They actually started berating me because I didn't know what to do as soon as we walked into a room. I had already beat the sp so I uninstalled. Couple years later my son was born. We beat co-op together last year, he was 9. It was incredible.
Portal 2 has my favourite co-op puzzle of all time, the one where the exit is directly in the middle of two angled portal platforms that launch you way over the middle so it seems impossible to land there. Where the solution is >!that both players have to go through at the same time and collide in mid-air to stall your jump!<.

It's the one puzzle I absolutely refuse to give any hints on if I'm playing it with someone new, because it's such a satisfying solution to arrive at yourself.
    That one is brilliant!

My sister and I were trying to solve it for ages, then she had to leave. An hour or so later the solution flashed into my brain and I had to confirm it! But nobody else was around. So I somehow managed to use both controllers at once and still get Atlas and Peabody to slam into each other! Even bigger success!

Solo dual-controller triumph?
If you are on PC, there are hundreds of fantastic custom made co-op levels available through steam workshop.
    and thousands of terrible ones too!
Me and a buddy pretty much played all the community maps there were. There are some really fun challenges on there that border on masochism. So much fun to be had there.
God the whole build up leading to you figuring out that last puzzle in the climax was a masterful blending of story and puzzle you don't really see elsewhere
    So much of that game was masterfully crafted. There’s a moment where you are bouncing on some gel and having a conversation with Wheatley in the rafters every time you hit the apex of the jump and it is SO naturally and perfectly comedically timed I still don’t think I’ve been quite so entertained by a game since
    Yeah, and fun fact, I'll keep it vague but you'll know, the developers actually took the time to code in the impulse for the portal gun, all through the game it's effectively instant, it's going the speed of light, but the distance from you to the wall is close enough that instant is fine. But for one particular shot, the distance is exactly how long it would *really* take to reach the target. There is a noticable pause, and that pause is ***accurate.***
And the third Portal game... oh wait
    Portal Revolution came out recently and it was absolutely superb
It has very low requirements, if you have a computer it can probably run it.
The science boys haven't nailed down what element it is yet, but we do know it's a lively one and it DOES NOT like the human skeleton
    Those of you who volunteered to be injected with praying mantis DNA, I've got some good news and some bad news. Bad news is we're postponing those tests indefinitely. Good news is we've got a much better test for you: fighting an army of mantis men. Pick up a rifle and follow the yellow line.
        You’ll know when the test starts.
            I can hear this comment thread
    Sounds like Cadmium.

I just watched Whiplash recently, and the part where he says "I can still see you, Mini-Me!" made me instantly think of how Cave Johnson berates his employees
Wait what? Does it speak in his voice or just respond in Cave Johnson mannerisms? Is it just regular ol chat gpt or did someone make something portal related?
    I have no clue how it’s made, but I know that not all Cave Johnson GPTs are created equally. Some are simply fed a transcript, but the one by Jon McCumber (the one I like most) is more like the real deal and it’s not just a parrot reading lines like the other ones. No voices, but it’s so on-point that none are needed lol honestly 🤣

Ask him about flat earth, or about other caves from parallel universes no matter how whacky it may seem, send him a screenshot of a meme, anything you do with the man is just… chef’s kiss 😚
Back when games were completed before they hit the market
    And when they added stuff, it felt like stuff that deserved to get tacked on and made the game better as opposed to something that should have been there before.  The co-OP chambers and perpetual testing initiative make a great game better.
    why are you acting like that doesn't happen? you're looking in the wrong place if it does
        It happens, but goddamn is the ratio dipping down lately
    It even released early because we powered up GLaDOS with potatoes.
    Nah they were definitely unfinished buggy messes that just never got fixed or only got fixed in rereleases. 

“It’s not a bug itsa feature” followed bethesda way before skyrim was released. 

Theres a few final fantasy bosses in specific versions of the games you cant face in certain orders without crashign the game.

First two gens of pokemon were held together with paperclips and prayers. 

It’s just more common now due to volume + complexity + ability to fix as needed. Which the third one is a big negative, but even ignoring that wed still see more just cause of volume + complexity.
    Hoooly shit ppl just willfully ignore the past like 30 years of shovelware. There have always been shittily produced games, and yet the vast majority of non live-service titles even in recent years have been released in a complete state (and even many of those have a solid base release experience).
    Seriously. This makes me look at all the recent stuff coming out half baked with even more disdain.
Too many developers allow player movement and responsiveness in input to be a low priority. 

People who didn't grow up on the quake 1/2/3 and goldsource engines straight up don't understand how snappy and responsive everything was back in the day.

Most modern shooters feel like you're moving around on iceskates and aiming input has a subtle lag that just feels *off* compared to the older engines.

Valve feels like one of the only companies that really put player movement and input as a top priority, and built the engine out from that as a baseline.
    It's true across genres, too. I don't play MMOs anymore but when I did, the thing that kept WoW on top despite its questionable expansions and other issues was its movement and responsiveness. Outside of server latency, you press W and you move forward. You cast a spell and it casts. I tried others and it felt like animation quality took precedent over player control and "feel".
        Yeah, i think a big contributor to it is having momentum in the player as a variable, where you accelerate and decelerate with movement. It's usually pretty subtle, but makes the 'floaty' feeling of a lot of games very noticeable.
    This is why TF2 has not only managed to survive despite not getting any new content for 6 years but has actually grown.
    all the modern games try to feel "realistic" in their movements. I fucking hate it. It's why battlefield bad company 2 was so good and battlefield 3 after it sucked. its why GTA 5 sucks with the floppy fucking movements. Devs are forgetting were playing video games and dont want to feel rEAliSm in how our magic face melting characters move
God, that moment when it clicks in your head how you beat the final boss, that you have to >!shoot a portal at the fucking moon!<, that's genuinely one of the coolest moments in any video game I've played. My jaw was on the floor
    Absolutely one of the best player executed story moments in gaming!
        I love all the moments leading up to it. Mentions of moon rocks and moon dust and whatnot all over the place. Even if you paid zero attention to any of the dialogue the game makes it so explicit that white surface is portal-able and black isn’t. Then comes the final cutscene, the moon, glowing white, contrasted by the pitch black night sky. Nothing needs to be said, it just clicks. Magnificent finale.
            ...and the best thing is that it came out of a scrapped easter egg. There was supposed to be a visible moon near the beginning of the game, and if you placed a portal there you would get sucked in, die and get a fake ending with a song and credits rolling (I believe that was the original purpose of Exile Vilify in the game). However, they couldn't figure out how to end the battle with Wheatley in a satisfying way for quite a long time and in the end they scrapped the fake endings concept and just reused the one with the moon for the boss fight.
            Valve has always been amazing at keeping small details in their games that just make their environments feel so alive. Playing half life 2 feels more lifelike than a lot of AAA environments. Not to mention half life alyx which is just fucking beautiful
            Valve is exceptional at guiding the player without outright telling them what to do. The developer commentary for Portal 1 shows just how much thought goes into everything they make you do. Throwing the companion cube in the furnace is actually a small tutorial for doing the same thing to the cores during GLaDOS’ boss fight.
    A neat thing about that is how it's setup so there are only two places where you can have portals, one being by the button so you're all ready to do it, but placing the final portal triggers the end of the game even if you use the wrong one
FUN FACT: Voice actor for Glados sang the ending opera
    FUN FACT: Voice actor for GLaDOS is married to the voice actor of Sniper from TF2.
        FUN FACT: The voice actor for GLaDOS is also the voice actor for the Administrator in Team Fortress 2, the Combine Overwatch in Half-Life 2, Brood Mother and Death Prophet in Dota 2, and the Witch in Left 4 Dead 2 (and 1).
            I'm having so much fun right now
    Ellen McLain is wonderful
    GlaDOS was also the computer's voice in Gypsy Danger in Pacific Rim. Guillermo del Toro did that on purpose because of Ellen McLain's voice work in the Portal games.
    FUN FACT: The voice of Glados is the same voice used in Pacific Rim for the Jaeger AI
speaking of the ending...I can't explain why, but I will never fail to be moved by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90iFStSMnH4) someone made of an animation of Chell outside feeling the rain after escaping, while rain sounds play along with Exile Vilify (the song The National contibuted to the Portal 2 soundtrack).

it provokes an emotion I don't even know how to describe.  maybe not as moving to others as it is to me, but just wanted to share it.
    I loved so many of the Portal user created videos for that song.
BEEEEEWOOOOOOOoooooo^ooooooo ..... 

****ding!****
Alyx has ruined VR for me. Nothing else gets even remotely close and it really feels like Valve is the only studio who actually seriously gave a shit about putting out a AAA VR title.

Its not my favorite game, but it was absolutely 100% the best singleplayer gaming experience ive had. ever.
    Alyx exists because of the intersection of two things... Two things that intersect nowhere else in the gaming industry:

1. Game developer has virtually infinite money.

2. Game developer is privately owned and has no obligation to shareholders to attempt to turn a profit on their game.

Valve is the only company that can make a AAA+ quality game for a tiny audience.
        I'd say a couple more:

- Game developer is a major player in VR tech
- Game developer has IP with an engine that works in VR
    Dark souls ruined most pancake games for me, Alyx ruined most Vr games lol.
        I sold my headset a couple months after i put down Alyx for this very reason. I'll come back to VR in a couple years, at the very least just to play Alyx again.
    Yeah nothing really compares to the level of HL Alyx in the VR space. It was meant to be a launch title but years later it's still far and away the best title on VR.. and it's not even close. 

The problem with AAA VR games is two fold:

- they are expensive and technically challenging to make. 
- VR users are just a fraction of the PC gaming market... which itself is just a subset of the overall gaming market. 

So unfortunately AAA studios rather put their time and money into projects that support a wider audience instead of a niche one, which is a shame. They figure the juice isn't worth the squeeze.

This is also why you hardly ever see VR games go on sale.

I'm hoping VR becomes a little more mainstream especially now that Apple has gotten in it (kinda), but who knows. It may just remain this way for quite some time.
Not that most people would know.
    It's sad that barely any people play alyx, because it's a VR game, it didn't sell that bad because it incentivized people to buy VR sets but it was for a less wider audience
I stand by this. Portal 2 was the best game I'd ever played until I played Half-Life: Alyx. I wish more people would play it, it was shocking to not hear a ton of discussion about it when it released, simply because so few people have a VR headset. I've never had a game hit me like that game did, especially the ending.
    It will be like Portal, playable 10 years from now and still feel new. Mostly because it's still the king of VR and it's been years :(
        Nobody else has Valve money to do absolutely anything they want, even knowing it’ll never make a cent of profit.
            So Microsoft now has less money than Valve? Did they spend it all on game companies again?
                Microsoft want to make profits, they don’t make games for the love of making amazing groundbreaking games. Alyx was valve saying look we can do with VR.
                    It really is such a refreshing thing to deal with valves mindset on business compared to most others, with valve they're so confident in steam and their other high profit products that they decide to do stuff that is new and exciting every once in a while knowing it will probably lose money.

Compare that to really any other major company in gaming and its obvious. There's a sense of desperation in getting *everything* to make major profits, and if it's not doing that and can't be made to do that then it gets tossed to the wayside.
            Valve literally says they make half life games to show off new tech
    Alyx was a life changer.
        100%.  There's literally nothing else like it.
            One of the best games I've ever played and I can't finish it because I'm scared to pick up the flashlight
                Dude, I was in the area with the flashlight and some headcrabs and my cat brushed past my leg.  I literally screamed.
    [deleted]
        Quest 3 and apple vr just came out within the last 4 months??
And if you have a pc capable of it you can play alyx plenty well on the quest
            [deleted]
Portal: Revolution should also be great. i think i'm going to try that one now.
    I thought it was even better than Mel.
    it's pretty much the exact same with a few extra mechanics. super fun though and very true to the original.
Man, I loved the Talos Principle.  And now I've discovered there's a sequel.  Thanks!
    and the entire sequel is drop dead gorgeous
The Witness got tedious fast for me. I remember going through the first sets of puzzles and then searching how long the average playthrough was and immediately stopping when I realized I'd be doing 17+ hours of these puzzles lol.
Oh yeah, the Witness is amazing. Beautiful game. Sound design is top-notch. My only complaint is the >!birdsong puzzles. Ugh. I knew what I had to do, I just couldn't pick out the audio for the longer ones and had to look up the answers.!<
    Hah, that's funny. The eureka moment of figuring that one out was one of the game's highlights for me.
As an avid puzzle enjoyer these games are all in my top 10, but The Witness holds the spot as my favourite game of all time.  
  
To start with I thought the puzzle format would get tedious, but it never did. On paper, it's all just line puzzles, but the inventive ways they manage to use that limited format throughout the game is incredible.  
    
More than anything through I just love the vibes of the game. A vibrant, colourful, mysterious, slightly lonely and melancholy feeling island with god knows how many things and places to poke around in and discover.   
     
People say this a lot, but I truly mean it when I say I wish I could wipe my memory of The Witness and replay it. Because one of my favourite aspects of the game inherently leaves it with almost no replay value, unfortunately.
You really cannot compare. Portal is like a thriller movie while the Talos Principles is like a philosophy book. They also have different narrative designs but you could see that they both take a lot of effort.
Talos 2 is like the jump from Portal 1 to Portal 2 story-wise. Its a fleshed out world with a pretty complete story.
    I'm just now learning there is a Talos 2. I absolutely loved the the first game. I'm so excited to get home from work tonight!
    I thought Talos 1 was a beautiful game when I played it on launch and again in 2019. Booted up Talos 2 on a 7900 XTX and i'm absolutely blown away by how detailed the UE5 environments are.

I kept looking down at my character's feet because the ground was covered in high-fidelity, fully modelled grass, pebbles, leaves, twigs, logs etc. that were all casting shadows! I really hope it secures some DLC.
Talos Principle writing is solid - it’s just not comedy genre. Apples and oranges.
    Apples and Lemons*
        What, did life just give you lemons? I think you know what to do with them if you played Portal 2.
            Burn down life's house with the lemons!
            Turn them into incendiary grenades?
        “I don’t want your damn lemons!”
The writing in the Talos Principle is stellar imo.
Did someone avoid reading all the lore pieces in Talos? The writing is top tier. Of course the narrative and storytell are way different.
    I didnt say talos was bad. I meant that if you love puzzles talos fills that void wonderfully. 


But if you loved the writing of portal its not a garuntee to fill that void with Talos.


Its a great game but fills vastly different types of storytelling 
        Fair enough, buddy!
I understand that some people really enjoy the writing and philosophy and lore in the Talos Principle. I sort of liked it in the first one... but I find myself skipping through all the diologue and lore and junk in the Talos Principle 2. It's a bit much. I wanna solve puzzles, not ponder the universe.
If you like Antichamber, you might also like Manifold Garden.
I would also recommend *Doom Eternal.*
I will add Supraland. It's a bit different than the others but is a *very* solid puzzle game.
    Lol definitely a way better fit than The Stanley Parable. And not enough people have played it. The puzzles are so good.
    other puzzle game recommendations:  
ViewFinder (not that difficult, but creative)  
Superliminal

Great game.

The day I finally got to play it after the 5 year break was incredible.
Friendly reminder about the "don't play for 5 years" or whatever achievement, for those who may have started trying to get that one!
If you haven't check out Taiji. It's a 2D Witness.

On that note, the current Humble Bundle has a "mindbending masterpieces" sale that has Taiji, The Witness, The Talos Principle, Manifold Garden, Superliminal, Patrick's Parabox and The Pedestrian for about $20.

Imo, the game improves over time but if you really hated the first level it just might not be your game. I will also say that it is probably my favourite puzzle game of all time tho...
I'd say completing the first world is enough to understand  whether you want to continue. The puzzles definitely get more variety when you unlock new puzzle elements, but the story is not spoonfed like in Portal. You can complete the game and remain oblivious to the story. It's for those people that like exploration and discovery.
Please! Give me more! I'm almost done with Revolution and I'm sad I'll be out of new content.
    Try Portal Reloaded
And instant suspend
    And a proper update schedule that won’t bone you when you’re trying to just relax and play video games
And instant suspend
I almost never play mine not plugged in. 30w turbo mode FTW.
Fr, I love my rog, but the battery doesn’t last me more than 4-5 hours even with some settings I stg💀

FYI: Usual lifespan is ~2 hours
Exactly my problem with Portal 2. It's a better game than 1, but it's a worse puzzle game.
    1 >>>>>> 2 in every way imo

Graphically better? Hell no. But why can’t a game be someone’s personal favorite just because it’s old?
[deleted]
    Yeah. I like the game, but saying it's the best of all time just ignores the innovation and advances made to future games.
unfortunately, people refuse to believe that and think older gaming was just this utopia
    Nostalgia is a hell of a drug
    Survival bias is strong in this one
    Honestly gaming is better now than in 2011 in a lot of ways. Most of today’s shitty practices were already in place but every game was also trying to be literally CoD. Meanwhile, EA was experimenting with ‘Online Passes’ where you’d have to spend an extra $20 access multiplayer if you bought a used copy of the game. Glad those trends are dead. 
"Man when I go back to this old very popular game that holds up over years, I think why aren't modern games like this?"
for whatever reason your comment reminded me of this video 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiMyCzezfTg
Yep. We have the benefit of selecting the best of the best games when looking back at older titles. There were a lot of shitty games too, but if you’re looking at the classics, of course they’re good. 

It’s like playing the hits from the 90s or 80s. There was a lot of bad music, but you don’t hear it because they just aren’t talked about anymore. Same with movies
Ok cool, I appreciate your feedback! It seems like it'd be a really nice thing to have a handheld computer (rog) to do what ever you want. Although I am not thrilled about having another Windows machine to mess with. Steam Deck seems pretty clean in its UI.
    I can't recommend the Ally enough. Once you get over the set-up hump, it runs like a charm. It also plays nice with MS Game Pass, which requires a work-around on the Deck.
        I have no doubt, it seems to be a lot more powerful. Which ally do you guys have? The normal or extreme? There looks to be a big jump in cpu
            It's the extreme. It was $200 off during the holidays; don't know where it sits now.
                Ah ok, yeah I would go with the extreme but unfortunately it's a 300$ difference right now (400 vs 700)

But I'm thinking I'll go with an Ally Z1 somewhat soon.
From the other side, I love my OLED deck. The display is fabulous and the battery is better than I thought possible with this level of performance in this form factor. 800p can be kind of ugly in some games but usually it works out ok, I blame the game for not handling resolutions properly (i.e. subnautica reticle looks super ugly, aliased, and kinda square in anything below 1440p, 1080p looks mostly ok but 1440p and above is an actual perfect clean circle, Minecraft has horrible aliasing, especially beta minecraft at 800p, the textures are supposed to be low res sure but good god the shimmering. Ashley in RE4 remaster hair looks like a witch instead of a 20 something year old girl)
It also has amazing voice acting. GladOS, Wheatley, Cave Johnson... so good. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley is so good.

*Most test subjects do experience some cognitive deterioration after a few months in suspension. Now you've been under for... quite a lot longer, and it's not out of the question that you might have a very minor case of serious brain damage. But don't be alarmed, alright? Although, if you do feel alarm, try to hold onto that feeling because that is the proper reaction to being told you have brain damage.*
    I still think my favorite part of the game is Cave Johnson freaking out about how he doesn't want any damn lemons and he's going to make a combustible lemon to burn life's house down.
        After speaking to the manager!
    Say goodnight Carolyn!

Mirror's Edge(2008) is also pretty timeless in the graphics department. Turns out if the environment is a dystopian white concrete hell you can get away with a lot of graphical shortcuts.
BoTW, ToTK, Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, and every other 3D Zelda title still takes a back seat to how fucking magical wind waker is. Such a brilliant game.
    Wind Waker really needs a true sequel. I would love a hybrid game of Wind Waker and BoTW where it's an open world sailing Zelda game with crafting and cell shaded graphics.  My one complaint in Wind Waker is how it feels open world but it kind of isn't.  You really go to certain islands in a certain order instead of sailing at random. If they could find a way to make the islands more random and less order mandatory it would be so cool.
        I think that comes down to a limitation of the game cube more than anything. Windwaker carried the style of the 2d games better and was just charming from start to end.
Theres also a lot of survivals all of a sudden.
    All of sudden? 

Were u living under a rock for like 10 years?
        Go easy, he's just surviving out here with the rest of us
> trying to be the next fortnite

This reminded me that the real halo killer was halo all along. :( 

So many console sci-fi shooters trying to be the next "halo killer" but all it took was a dude named Brian Reed to make Halo the "bad guy" when we all knew eh was a pretty cool guy.
    I had a good bit of fun with splitgate. It even had a decent surge of players a bit before the latest halo came out. Basically just halo with portals and it felt nice and pretty fun.
    Wait, what happened, exactly?
        Brian Reed was head story writer on Halo 5 which put the player as a member of Fireteam Osiris (Locke). Players didn't enjoy the story or locke much and people think made them put the main-line halo games to bed in favor of whatever halo infinite is for a while.

He was fired in 2017, btw.

And then you have Spec Ops: The Line
[deleted]
    give it a try if you can. i dont get motion sickness but a weird uncomfortable feeling if a game takes over the camera in unexpected ways and portal felt surprisingly natural. it also immediately snaps you in position when you enter exit the portal without standard animation guess that helps a lot.
if you can handle it it is one of the best gaming experiences there are and way better than it was on a flat screen.
        I recall in an interview, someone at valve said they really looked into doing an official portal vr port, and scrapped it because the vast majority of users got extremely sick no matter how they tried to handle the portal transitions. And it makes sense. I'm sure it's fun if you can handle it, but the main cause of motion sickness in vr is when you appear to be moving without actually moving irl. Can't avoid that when flying through a portal. Surprisingly when I first got the original rift *years* ago, when I'd have people try it, almost nobody could stomach Google earth vr because you are flying around.
still probably the best value in terms of game quality to $$ that I've ever spent though
    HL2 + episodes, TF2, and Portal for 60 bucks? Absolute steal, was my first time getting to experience any half life, as well.
        I bought years later in 2014 for like 25 CAD on PS3, and everything in it still felt brand new.
            I never even knew it had a PS3 release, that's pretty neat

    Half the comment sections are bots posting these days. It's weird as fuck.

"So, how are you holding up? BECAUSE I'M A POTATO"
    *slow clap* “Oh good. That’s still working”
    I will never forget the first time I heard this line. My then-GF and I absolutely lost our shit, had to pause play while we wiped tears away.
“I’ve been really busy being dead. You know, after you murdered me?”
    "You did what?? Gah!"
        "Okay look, we've both said a lot of things that you're going to regret."
            "But I think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster."
                "You know, since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really love to test. I love it too. There's just one thing we need to take care of first.."
                "I will say, though, you must really, really love to test. I love it too. There's just one thing we need to take care of first..."
            This is the line. This is the one that's my favorite in the game.
    I think my favourite is the fat shaming reads. 

"Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds."
        The best one was from the co-op mode:

"Did you know humans frown on weight variances? If you want to upset a human, just say that their weight variance is above or below the norm."
        Look at you, sailing through the air majestically. Like an Eagle. Piloting a blimp.
It's honestly hard to overstate my satisfaction with the game
    I mean you in apature science after all, you do what you must because you can.
        Its for the good of all of us, after all. Except the ones who are dead. They would be fine with it.
            Yeah there's truly no sense crying over every mistake.
                Personally, I think the other game companies need to keep trying til they run out of (metaphorical) cake
                    And the games will get done and they'll make some neat fun for the players who are still alive
                        I'm not even angry about this chain of puns
You monster 
You are a terrible person, it says so right here. Terrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
Yea I mean that's on your nephew but can't really blame him. When I played with people I sat back and let them take the lead. I would only gently guide them if they got stuck
    We quickly realized neither of us were having fun and played something else instead haha
This was my 1st experience in co-op with a rando. They actually started berating me because I didn't know what to do as soon as we walked into a room. I had already beat the sp so I uninstalled. Couple years later my son was born. We beat co-op together last year, he was 9. It was incredible.
That one is brilliant!

My sister and I were trying to solve it for ages, then she had to leave. An hour or so later the solution flashed into my brain and I had to confirm it! But nobody else was around. So I somehow managed to use both controllers at once and still get Atlas and Peabody to slam into each other! Even bigger success!

Solo dual-controller triumph?
and thousands of terrible ones too!
So much of that game was masterfully crafted. There’s a moment where you are bouncing on some gel and having a conversation with Wheatley in the rafters every time you hit the apex of the jump and it is SO naturally and perfectly comedically timed I still don’t think I’ve been quite so entertained by a game since
Yeah, and fun fact, I'll keep it vague but you'll know, the developers actually took the time to code in the impulse for the portal gun, all through the game it's effectively instant, it's going the speed of light, but the distance from you to the wall is close enough that instant is fine. But for one particular shot, the distance is exactly how long it would *really* take to reach the target. There is a noticable pause, and that pause is ***accurate.***
Portal Revolution came out recently and it was absolutely superb
Those of you who volunteered to be injected with praying mantis DNA, I've got some good news and some bad news. Bad news is we're postponing those tests indefinitely. Good news is we've got a much better test for you: fighting an army of mantis men. Pick up a rifle and follow the yellow line.
    You’ll know when the test starts.

Where? Is it hidden or something?
I have no clue how it’s made, but I know that not all Cave Johnson GPTs are created equally. Some are simply fed a transcript, but the one by Jon McCumber (the one I like most) is more like the real deal and it’s not just a parrot reading lines like the other ones. No voices, but it’s so on-point that none are needed lol honestly 🤣

Ask him about flat earth, or about other caves from parallel universes no matter how whacky it may seem, send him a screenshot of a meme, anything you do with the man is just… chef’s kiss 😚
And when they added stuff, it felt like stuff that deserved to get tacked on and made the game better as opposed to something that should have been there before.  The co-OP chambers and perpetual testing initiative make a great game better.
why are you acting like that doesn't happen? you're looking in the wrong place if it does
    It happens, but goddamn is the ratio dipping down lately
It even released early because we powered up GLaDOS with potatoes.
Nah they were definitely unfinished buggy messes that just never got fixed or only got fixed in rereleases. 

“It’s not a bug itsa feature” followed bethesda way before skyrim was released. 

Theres a few final fantasy bosses in specific versions of the games you cant face in certain orders without crashign the game.

First two gens of pokemon were held together with paperclips and prayers. 

It’s just more common now due to volume + complexity + ability to fix as needed. Which the third one is a big negative, but even ignoring that wed still see more just cause of volume + complexity.
Hoooly shit ppl just willfully ignore the past like 30 years of shovelware. There have always been shittily produced games, and yet the vast majority of non live-service titles even in recent years have been released in a complete state (and even many of those have a solid base release experience).
Seriously. This makes me look at all the recent stuff coming out half baked with even more disdain.
It's true across genres, too. I don't play MMOs anymore but when I did, the thing that kept WoW on top despite its questionable expansions and other issues was its movement and responsiveness. Outside of server latency, you press W and you move forward. You cast a spell and it casts. I tried others and it felt like animation quality took precedent over player control and "feel".
    Yeah, i think a big contributor to it is having momentum in the player as a variable, where you accelerate and decelerate with movement. It's usually pretty subtle, but makes the 'floaty' feeling of a lot of games very noticeable.
This is why TF2 has not only managed to survive despite not getting any new content for 6 years but has actually grown.
all the modern games try to feel "realistic" in their movements. I fucking hate it. It's why battlefield bad company 2 was so good and battlefield 3 after it sucked. its why GTA 5 sucks with the floppy fucking movements. Devs are forgetting were playing video games and dont want to feel rEAliSm in how our magic face melting characters move
Absolutely one of the best player executed story moments in gaming!
    I love all the moments leading up to it. Mentions of moon rocks and moon dust and whatnot all over the place. Even if you paid zero attention to any of the dialogue the game makes it so explicit that white surface is portal-able and black isn’t. Then comes the final cutscene, the moon, glowing white, contrasted by the pitch black night sky. Nothing needs to be said, it just clicks. Magnificent finale.
        ...and the best thing is that it came out of a scrapped easter egg. There was supposed to be a visible moon near the beginning of the game, and if you placed a portal there you would get sucked in, die and get a fake ending with a song and credits rolling (I believe that was the original purpose of Exile Vilify in the game). However, they couldn't figure out how to end the battle with Wheatley in a satisfying way for quite a long time and in the end they scrapped the fake endings concept and just reused the one with the moon for the boss fight.
        Valve has always been amazing at keeping small details in their games that just make their environments feel so alive. Playing half life 2 feels more lifelike than a lot of AAA environments. Not to mention half life alyx which is just fucking beautiful
        Valve is exceptional at guiding the player without outright telling them what to do. The developer commentary for Portal 1 shows just how much thought goes into everything they make you do. Throwing the companion cube in the furnace is actually a small tutorial for doing the same thing to the cores during GLaDOS’ boss fight.
A neat thing about that is how it's setup so there are only two places where you can have portals, one being by the button so you're all ready to do it, but placing the final portal triggers the end of the game even if you use the wrong one
FUN FACT: Voice actor for GLaDOS is married to the voice actor of Sniper from TF2.
    FUN FACT: The voice actor for GLaDOS is also the voice actor for the Administrator in Team Fortress 2, the Combine Overwatch in Half-Life 2, Brood Mother and Death Prophet in Dota 2, and the Witch in Left 4 Dead 2 (and 1).
        I'm having so much fun right now
Ellen McLain is wonderful
GlaDOS was also the computer's voice in Gypsy Danger in Pacific Rim. Guillermo del Toro did that on purpose because of Ellen McLain's voice work in the Portal games.
FUN FACT: The voice of Glados is the same voice used in Pacific Rim for the Jaeger AI
I loved so many of the Portal user created videos for that song.
Alyx exists because of the intersection of two things... Two things that intersect nowhere else in the gaming industry:

1. Game developer has virtually infinite money.

2. Game developer is privately owned and has no obligation to shareholders to attempt to turn a profit on their game.

Valve is the only company that can make a AAA+ quality game for a tiny audience.
    I'd say a couple more:

- Game developer is a major player in VR tech
- Game developer has IP with an engine that works in VR
Dark souls ruined most pancake games for me, Alyx ruined most Vr games lol.
    I sold my headset a couple months after i put down Alyx for this very reason. I'll come back to VR in a couple years, at the very least just to play Alyx again.
Yeah nothing really compares to the level of HL Alyx in the VR space. It was meant to be a launch title but years later it's still far and away the best title on VR.. and it's not even close. 

The problem with AAA VR games is two fold:

- they are expensive and technically challenging to make. 
- VR users are just a fraction of the PC gaming market... which itself is just a subset of the overall gaming market. 

So unfortunately AAA studios rather put their time and money into projects that support a wider audience instead of a niche one, which is a shame. They figure the juice isn't worth the squeeze.

This is also why you hardly ever see VR games go on sale.

I'm hoping VR becomes a little more mainstream especially now that Apple has gotten in it (kinda), but who knows. It may just remain this way for quite some time.
It's sad that barely any people play alyx, because it's a VR game, it didn't sell that bad because it incentivized people to buy VR sets but it was for a less wider audience
It will be like Portal, playable 10 years from now and still feel new. Mostly because it's still the king of VR and it's been years :(
    Nobody else has Valve money to do absolutely anything they want, even knowing it’ll never make a cent of profit.
        So Microsoft now has less money than Valve? Did they spend it all on game companies again?
            Microsoft want to make profits, they don’t make games for the love of making amazing groundbreaking games. Alyx was valve saying look we can do with VR.
                It really is such a refreshing thing to deal with valves mindset on business compared to most others, with valve they're so confident in steam and their other high profit products that they decide to do stuff that is new and exciting every once in a while knowing it will probably lose money.

Compare that to really any other major company in gaming and its obvious. There's a sense of desperation in getting *everything* to make major profits, and if it's not doing that and can't be made to do that then it gets tossed to the wayside.
        Valve literally says they make half life games to show off new tech
Alyx was a life changer.
    100%.  There's literally nothing else like it.
        One of the best games I've ever played and I can't finish it because I'm scared to pick up the flashlight
            Dude, I was in the area with the flashlight and some headcrabs and my cat brushed past my leg.  I literally screamed.

    Quest 3 and apple vr just came out within the last 4 months??
And if you have a pc capable of it you can play alyx plenty well on the quest
        [deleted]
I thought it was even better than Mel.
it's pretty much the exact same with a few extra mechanics. super fun though and very true to the original.
and the entire sequel is drop dead gorgeous
Hah, that's funny. The eureka moment of figuring that one out was one of the game's highlights for me.
I'm just now learning there is a Talos 2. I absolutely loved the the first game. I'm so excited to get home from work tonight!
I thought Talos 1 was a beautiful game when I played it on launch and again in 2019. Booted up Talos 2 on a 7900 XTX and i'm absolutely blown away by how detailed the UE5 environments are.

I kept looking down at my character's feet because the ground was covered in high-fidelity, fully modelled grass, pebbles, leaves, twigs, logs etc. that were all casting shadows! I really hope it secures some DLC.
Apples and Lemons*
    What, did life just give you lemons? I think you know what to do with them if you played Portal 2.
        Burn down life's house with the lemons!
        Turn them into incendiary grenades?
    “I don’t want your damn lemons!”
I didnt say talos was bad. I meant that if you love puzzles talos fills that void wonderfully. 


But if you loved the writing of portal its not a garuntee to fill that void with Talos.


Its a great game but fills vastly different types of storytelling 
    Fair enough, buddy!
Lol definitely a way better fit than The Stanley Parable. And not enough people have played it. The puzzles are so good.

I could maybe see that if the portal looked high tech, it technically is but not so much in relation to all other devices nowadays
Half the comment sections are bots posting these days. It's weird as fuck.
*slow clap* “Oh good. That’s still working”
I will never forget the first time I heard this line. My then-GF and I absolutely lost our shit, had to pause play while we wiped tears away.
"You did what?? Gah!"
    "Okay look, we've both said a lot of things that you're going to regret."
        "But I think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster."
            "You know, since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really love to test. I love it too. There's just one thing we need to take care of first.."
            "I will say, though, you must really, really love to test. I love it too. There's just one thing we need to take care of first..."
        This is the line. This is the one that's my favorite in the game.
I think my favourite is the fat shaming reads. 

"Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds."
    The best one was from the co-op mode:

"Did you know humans frown on weight variances? If you want to upset a human, just say that their weight variance is above or below the norm."
    Look at you, sailing through the air majestically. Like an Eagle. Piloting a blimp.
I mean you in apature science after all, you do what you must because you can.
    Its for the good of all of us, after all. Except the ones who are dead. They would be fine with it.
        Yeah there's truly no sense crying over every mistake.
            Personally, I think the other game companies need to keep trying til they run out of (metaphorical) cake
                And the games will get done and they'll make some neat fun for the players who are still alive
                    I'm not even angry about this chain of puns
We quickly realized neither of us were having fun and played something else instead haha
>That one is brilliant!

>My sister and I were trying to solve it for ages, then she had to leave. An hour or so later the solution flashed into my brain and I had to confirm it! But nobody else was around. So I somehow managed to use both controllers at once and still get Atlas and Peabody to slam into each other! Even bigger success!

Solo dual-controller triumph?
You’ll know when the test starts.
    I can hear this comment thread
 **DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?! I'M THE MAN THAT'S GONNA BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN! WITH THE LEMONS!!!**
    Burning people! He said what we’re all thinking!!
It happens, but goddamn is the ratio dipping down lately
Yeah, i think a big contributor to it is having momentum in the player as a variable, where you accelerate and decelerate with movement. It's usually pretty subtle, but makes the 'floaty' feeling of a lot of games very noticeable.
I love all the moments leading up to it. Mentions of moon rocks and moon dust and whatnot all over the place. Even if you paid zero attention to any of the dialogue the game makes it so explicit that white surface is portal-able and black isn’t. Then comes the final cutscene, the moon, glowing white, contrasted by the pitch black night sky. Nothing needs to be said, it just clicks. Magnificent finale.
    ...and the best thing is that it came out of a scrapped easter egg. There was supposed to be a visible moon near the beginning of the game, and if you placed a portal there you would get sucked in, die and get a fake ending with a song and credits rolling (I believe that was the original purpose of Exile Vilify in the game). However, they couldn't figure out how to end the battle with Wheatley in a satisfying way for quite a long time and in the end they scrapped the fake endings concept and just reused the one with the moon for the boss fight.
    Valve has always been amazing at keeping small details in their games that just make their environments feel so alive. Playing half life 2 feels more lifelike than a lot of AAA environments. Not to mention half life alyx which is just fucking beautiful
    Valve is exceptional at guiding the player without outright telling them what to do. The developer commentary for Portal 1 shows just how much thought goes into everything they make you do. Throwing the companion cube in the furnace is actually a small tutorial for doing the same thing to the cores during GLaDOS’ boss fight.
FUN FACT: The voice actor for GLaDOS is also the voice actor for the Administrator in Team Fortress 2, the Combine Overwatch in Half-Life 2, Brood Mother and Death Prophet in Dota 2, and the Witch in Left 4 Dead 2 (and 1).
    I'm having so much fun right now
I'd say a couple more:

- Game developer is a major player in VR tech
- Game developer has IP with an engine that works in VR
I sold my headset a couple months after i put down Alyx for this very reason. I'll come back to VR in a couple years, at the very least just to play Alyx again.
Nobody else has Valve money to do absolutely anything they want, even knowing it’ll never make a cent of profit.
    So Microsoft now has less money than Valve? Did they spend it all on game companies again?
        Microsoft want to make profits, they don’t make games for the love of making amazing groundbreaking games. Alyx was valve saying look we can do with VR.
            It really is such a refreshing thing to deal with valves mindset on business compared to most others, with valve they're so confident in steam and their other high profit products that they decide to do stuff that is new and exciting every once in a while knowing it will probably lose money.

Compare that to really any other major company in gaming and its obvious. There's a sense of desperation in getting *everything* to make major profits, and if it's not doing that and can't be made to do that then it gets tossed to the wayside.
    Valve literally says they make half life games to show off new tech
100%.  There's literally nothing else like it.
    One of the best games I've ever played and I can't finish it because I'm scared to pick up the flashlight
        Dude, I was in the area with the flashlight and some headcrabs and my cat brushed past my leg.  I literally screamed.
Quest 3 and apple vr just came out within the last 4 months??
And if you have a pc capable of it you can play alyx plenty well on the quest

What, did life just give you lemons? I think you know what to do with them if you played Portal 2.
    Burn down life's house with the lemons!
    Turn them into incendiary grenades?
“I don’t want your damn lemons!”
Fair enough, buddy!

I have no doubt, it seems to be a lot more powerful. Which ally do you guys have? The normal or extreme? There looks to be a big jump in cpu
    It's the extreme. It was $200 off during the holidays; don't know where it sits now.
        Ah ok, yeah I would go with the extreme but unfortunately it's a 300$ difference right now (400 vs 700)

But I'm thinking I'll go with an Ally Z1 somewhat soon.
After speaking to the manager!
She is a gem.
I think that comes down to a limitation of the game cube more than anything. Windwaker carried the style of the 2d games better and was just charming from start to end.
Go easy, he's just surviving out here with the rest of us
Brian Reed was head story writer on Halo 5 which put the player as a member of Fireteam Osiris (Locke). Players didn't enjoy the story or locke much and people think made them put the main-line halo games to bed in favor of whatever halo infinite is for a while.

He was fired in 2017, btw.
I recall in an interview, someone at valve said they really looked into doing an official portal vr port, and scrapped it because the vast majority of users got extremely sick no matter how they tried to handle the portal transitions. And it makes sense. I'm sure it's fun if you can handle it, but the main cause of motion sickness in vr is when you appear to be moving without actually moving irl. Can't avoid that when flying through a portal. Surprisingly when I first got the original rift *years* ago, when I'd have people try it, almost nobody could stomach Google earth vr because you are flying around.
I bought years later in 2014 for like 25 CAD on PS3, and everything in it still felt brand new.
    I never even knew it had a PS3 release, that's pretty neat
50 on steam akshully
