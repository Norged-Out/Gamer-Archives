[[It's been 10 years since the masterpiece that is Portal 2 was released.]]





Okay. Look. We both said a lot of things that you're going to regret. But I think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster.

        Some fun bit of trivia, ‘when life gives you lemons’ isn’t a common saying in France, so French Cave Johnson goes on a completely separate and hilarious tirade about how when life is a Big Bad Wolf trying to blow your house down you should cut the wolf’s legs off.
            Je vais ordonner à mes ingénieurs de monter des rotules sur ta maison pour pouvoir les lui péter !
                This is exceptionally pleasing to me. I now wish to replay this masterpiece en francais.
        Damn, that flows really well. Now I wanna hear him say it this way.
        He’s saying what we’re all thinking!!!
        I've always loved GLaDOS's little weak supporting cheers that play in the background when the player listens to cave's rants lol.
        AND YOU LEAVE MY MOTHER OUT OF THIS!
        Chariots, chariots, just wanted you to know that Spider-Man is a menace and I want pictures of him by tomorrow morning.
    Clap ... Clap ... Clap ... 

Oh good. It still works.
    Sorry about the mess. I've really let the place go since you killed me. By the way, thanks for that.

 *[Sarcasm Self Test Complete.]*

 Oh good, that's back online.
    Hey, how are you holding up? Because I'm a potato!
Before you came along no one tried to murder me. Or put me in a potato. Or fed me to birds.
    I had a pretty good life. And then *you* showed up. You dangerous, mute, lunatic.
        So you know what? You win!! Just go.....
It's been fun, don't come back
            🎶Cara bella, cara mia bella!    
Mia bambina, o Chell.    
Ché la stimo...    
Ché la stimo.    
O cara mia, addio!    


La mia bambina cara,    
Perché non passi lontana?    
Sì, lontana da Scienza,    
Cara, cara mia bambina?    
Ah, mia bella!    
Ah, mia cara!    
Ah, mia cara!    
Ah, mia bambina!    
O cara, cara mia...    

Mia cara!    
Ah, mia cara!    
Ah, mia bambina!    
O cara, cara mia...🎶
                I love Cara Mia Addio so much. Ellen McClain improvised a lot of the Italian on the spot.
                    It was so good! I play through the game every once in a while just to hear "The Turret Concierto!"
                Should've been the actual ending credits song, imo.
                    Idk want you gone still gives me chills every time I hear it
                        Yes. Want you gone and Still alive are so brilliant
                        Unpopular opinion, i know.  But "Want You Gone" doesnt hit the same as "Still Alive."
        I’m like 90% sure the quote is “You **dangerous**, Mute, Lunatic.”

But I could just be misremembering
            The right woman in the wrong place, can make all the difference in the world.
    same too me
    A potato?
"I used to want you dead, but now I only want you gone."
    Is there a deeper meaning to the lyrics or is it all just referring to the relationship between Glados and Chell?
        That’s the whole meaning, there’s also the sub context of her being Caroline, and possibly chells mother.
            Zoinks, Chell's mom?
                There’s a whole thing on glades and thus Caroline and cave Jonson actually being chells mom it’s never been proven tho and even Glados’s actress dosnt know.

(EDIT) Im updating this since I honestly didn’t expect this to gain so much attention. 

The whole chells mom thing is a popular theory that hasn’t been proven, the only hints are cara Mia (turret opera) and Easter eggs. Glados’s voice actor has stated tho that cara Mia was her own idea it was also done from her memory Latin as a kid hence why the translation is bad as it’s mostly not recognizable. 

Look into it if your curious it’s a fun ride.
                    I believe the developers said that Glados wasn't part of the original project, but that the test players felt the game needed an antagonist, so they added it
                        This was also extremely early on in development
                            Glados made the game.
                                Agreed
                                It really did. Even if they just had an announcer (and even a good one like Cave Johnson) the game would have lacked the soul it has now.
                                    Go  play the  addon mel  on steam  cave jonhson talk most of the time
                                Actually, Valve did.
                                    Did you know the cake is a lie?
                                Absolutely. Some dialogue interactions had me dieing laughing. Also I guess we can't really call it interactions because we never do respond to Glados, ever. So she is really talking to herself. Such a great game.
                            The game ended up VERY different from how it started out :-) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narbacular_Drop

There’s actually a playable version of the original somewhere in the intertubes.
                                The same school had another student game called "Tag:The Power of Paint" iirc. In it you had a gun that painted surfaces with different colors, which would change how that surface reacted to the player.

One color would make you run fast, anther would make you bounce off the surface, and a third would make you stick to it and rotate your perspective.

Valve hired that group of students and put the concept into Portal 2.
                                    Ah!  Cool to know. Digipen seems to have had some pretty good students.
                                I remember playing this! I always said portal was a copy. I never remembered the name, and people doubted it's existence, but here it is!
                                Was free way back. I played it at some point or another.
                        the test players felt the game needed ~~an antagonist~~ a beacon of light
                    >cave Jonson actually being chells mom

CAVE JOHNSON IS HER MOM?
                        My engineers tried telling me drinking moon rock gel would make me infertile.  To hell with them I say! Just to prove them wrong, I'll have my own damn kid,  and when I do it,  I'm going to be both the father and the mother! Let's get to some science.
                            It's been 10 years, but I can still hear that man's voice in my head.
                                I'm willing to bet it's been less than 10 years since you've heard JK Simmons' voice, though.
                                    The man is a freaking treasure. He seems to just really embrace the crazy in every part he plays.
                                Me too, just now it has to do with insurance
                                This is true! 😂
                                Do you know who I am?

I'm the man whos gonna burn your house down!

With the lemons!
                            Why does this make me feel it's more likely as opposed to less likely?
                        Hey gang! Cave Johnson here! 

I'm just popping in to clear up some confusion. There have been some rumors that I have been engaging in relationships with Aperture employees that would be considered inappropriate for the workplace. Let me assure you, these rumors are absolutely false. There have also been rumors that I may or may not have sired certain children with certain people who may or may not have been my personal assistant, who I may or may not have arranged to be digitally copied to develop an AI to run the company once I finally succumb to this terrible illness that may or may not have been caused by powered moon rocks that I may or may not have also tried snorting one time in the 80's while trying to find new marketable applications for existing products. Let me assure you, that these rumors are absolutely true - but only under well defined probabilistic scenarios.

Let me explain. See, a few years back the boys in engineering started having trouble coming up with new ideas for products. We tried everything! We tried a portal gun with one entrance and two exits. We tried a new gel that makes literally anything it touches spontaneously combust. We even had a period where we considered getting back to our roots, so to speak, and making shower curtains again! Eventually we settled on the last idea we'd ever need, the Aperture Science Perpetual Testing Initiative. Now that we have access to the multiverse, we no longer need to come up with ideas, we can just steal them from some other version of ourselves! So what does this have to do with the rumors from earlier? Well, there are infinite multiverses, each with differences that could be minor, such as one guy having a minor corporate policy violation that's being blown way out of proportion by HR, or they could be significant changes affecting the entire human race. Case in point, the Cave Johnson addressing you right now is actually not human at all, but from a multiverse where everyone is actually a ferret. So you see, given the infinite variables between infinite multiverses, there is almost certainly one where the events being described have come to pass. But it's not this one! Nope! No sir! I give you my word. And it's like my father always told me, "Cave, a ferret that can't give you their word isn't a ferret, but a weasel." 

Anyway, I think that should clear up all of the confusion, so I won't bother talking about how you can contact me if you have anymore questions, since obviously there won't be any. 

Thanks,
-- Cave

                    Really? I just played through it again recently and I thought they were pretty clear about glados being her mother.
                    Wasn't Glados played by multiple actors?
                        No, GLaDOS was voiced by a single person, Ellen McLain.
                            I thought the singer from Faith No More voiced one of her personalities in Portal 2
                                Nah, this is his starring role in the game 

https://youtu.be/HOhLgfQqg_g
                        Damn just downvote this guy for being curious lol
                            I found that a bit interesting.
                            Proper reddit etiquette is to answer with words instead of downvotes!
                There's a part in the game where you come across science projects created by the kids of the workers, and one of them is signed by "Chell".

Could be just a random easter egg, but it's likely that she's at least the daughter of *someone* who worked there.
                    True, but it's also canon that she's adopted. Cave Johnson and Caroline could well be her biological parents though.
                        GLaDOS *says* she's adopted, but GLaDOS talks mad shit.
                            Yes, but the context, both GLaDOS and Wheatley say she's adopted. GLaDOS could simply have denied it, but she didn't, in fact she confirmed it, and *sympathized* with Chell about it.
                        Is it? I don't really fully trust whatever GLaDOS says.
                            Both Wheatley and GLaDOS state it as fact, and at that point GLaDOS is on Chell's side.
                                Oh, I didn't remember that.

Still, they didn't say *when* she was adopted, did they? She can be a worker's adopted daughter, no?
            Very likely Chell's mother. Per the Ratman comics, Doug took her as his own to hide the fact that the boss and his assistant were having an affair.
                Portal 2 is one of my all time favorite games, but I have no idea what you just said.
                    Doug Rattmann is the guy that wrote all the cake is a lie graffiti in the games. An old aperture science employee that survived glados killing everyone and went crazy living in the walls of the facility. 

They put out some comics called Ratman about Rattmann. I havent read them, so I can't tell you what happens in them. But seems like this person is saying Rattmann was chell's adopted parent? Raising her instead of Cave and Caroline? This is the first i'm hearing about it too. Not crazy about the idea.
                        He was schizophrenic and ran out of meds.
                    There's a comic book (I believe it's just called "Ratman"), where in we see Doug Ratman, the man who left all of the messages behind the walls in both games (as he slowly went insane). In the comic, it's revealed that his daughter was taken at take your daughter to work day (the day Glados was turned on) into the test subject pool. I haven't read it myself but it's apparent in the comic that 1) his daughter isn't biologically his 2) he "adopted" her from a coworker 3) he's resentful toward Cave & Caroline through his career. Putting that together, it's pretty strongly implied that Chell is the abandoned daughter of Caroline and Cave who was raised by Ratman (also why Glados relentlessly calls you adopted).
                        Ohhh GladOS is that cold.
                        That's pretty far off into crazy fan-theory land, though, and I think you're just misremembering; the take you daughter to work day isn't in the comic at all, and the same comic has him bumping Chell up to #1 on the list of test subjects for Portal 1 because the reason she was originally rejected from testing altogether was that her "tenacity" score was off the charts. Nothing in the text states or implies he knows her at all, much less that she's his adopted kid- the companion cube asks how he knew about her and says "know what?" and it was "something in her file". He's not trying to save her at that point (he is trying to save her after she's recaptured at the end of Portal 1), he's just picking someone out of the files that can fight back.
                            thank you for the clarification, I must be misremembering.
                GLaDOS is likely Chell's mom. Chell's Potato Battery science fair display is visible from the Bring Your Daughter To Work Day, so she was certainly the daughter of an employee.
            But Caroline is American and Cave Johnson is American, so it doesn't make sense because Chell is asian
                Caroline's last name can't be Li? Have you never met an Asian person who "sounded American"?
                    Here's an [in-game portrait](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/half-life/images/0/07/Cave_caroline_70s.png/revision/latest?cb=20120621160408&path-prefix=en) of the two of them. I wouldn't say she looks particularly asian.
                        Clearly this image is quite off. Doesn't look anything like the teacher from Whiplash.
                            But it kinda resembles that guy from that prison documentary
                    I am Asian
                        I am Groot
                When is this ever stated lol. If anything Chell looks a little like Caroline when you think about it.
                    "Chell is modeled after actress Alésia Glidewell, and appears to be of mixed-race white European and East or Southeast Asian background, with dark hair and blue eyes."

                        Wow that's interesting! Thanks.
                            I went to college with her.
                                Nice.
                            No problem
    She was a lot like you - maybe not quite as heavy.
    Do you want me to go back and listen to the songs from both portal games repeatedly? Because that’s how you get me to go back and listen to the songs from both portal games repeatedly.

Edit - I’m making a note here, huge success.

Edit edit - I choose to believe that Caroline is
Chell’s mother because it makes that song so beautiful. Sure there are the GLaDOS lines, like “except I wasn’t laughing” and “maybe not quite as heavy”, “oh did you think I meant you”

And then there are the Caroline lines that have me crying in a cafe right now:
- you want your freedom, take it, that’s what I’m counting on
- one day they woke me up so that I could live forever, it’s such a shame the same will never happen to you
- you’ve got your short, sad life left, that’s what I’m counting on

And the telltale from GLaDOS herself, “when I delete you maybe I’ll stop feeling so bad”


Edit edit edit - it’s such a beautifully right bit of writing. If you listen to it as the voice of a frenemy computer every line makes sense as a sarcastic barb. But if you listen to it as the voice of a dead, uploaded mother pushing to the surface of the mind she’s trapped in it is achingly beautiful.
        You and me both I love the mother theory but it’s shaky as there are some holes like their appearances that don’t work well.

            Where do you find this gloriously obnoxious tune??!!
This game aged very well. One of my altime favorites.
    One of the most memorable sets of video game characters I have seen, and one of them doesn't even speak.
        "You crazy, mute, lunatic."
            Stephen Merchant should have been cast as Vision in the MCU.
                He was very good in Logan (2017) as Caliban
        To be fair, you only see Chell slightly more often than you hear her.
            If that is how you play you mean. You can see her everytime you open a portal!
                Not every time. You only see yourself if the other portal faces your current position.
                    \*sigh\* You are technically correct. The best kind of correct.
        I wouldn’t say Chell is memorable, unless of course you’re talking about the companion cube
            Wait, Chell is the companion cube? How? Time travel? Cloning?
    Heck, even Portal 1 has aged well. Helps a lot that the graphics are pretty simple, but overall I think it's a testament to the quality of the Source engine, not to mention the great writing and voice acting.
        When I played both games back to back, I noticed that the puzzles in the first game are notably more challenging. With Portal 2 I found there was a lot more hints to the solutions.
            Portal 2 had more challenging puzzles but design that led you to grow into the puzzles very smoothly. There were still plenty of moments of having to work things out (at least for me).

But portal 2 also contains probably the greatest “puzzle” design of all time. They seed the moon rock = portal carrier stuff into the game just enough to lodge it in your head without making it feel like a Chekhov’s Gun. So when you’re in your death throes and the the ceiling opens to show the moon, the solution is instantly obvious and yet allows the player to feel smart in that moment. And the satisfaction from seeing your portal glint off the moon (I think they showed that portals propagate at c) was immense.
                Funny story: they calculated how long it should take to see the glint (because of the speed of light) but they couldn't use it because it was too slow and a lot of players looked away before they saw it.
                    2.6 seconds is an eternity for a gamer
                        More like 5 seconds for the round trip, assuming the gun works at the speed of light.
                            But it only takes 1.3 to get to the moon and 1.3 for the light to come back.
                                Huh, you're right. I've been off by a factor of 2 for years.
                        Fuck I just laughed out loud on a bus with only one other person and they are looking at me like I am strange.
                    There's a sign in 2 that says something like: In case of reactor implosion, look directly at implosion. 

AFAIK they put that sign in because they worked hard on the animation of the implosion and play testers never saw it because they turned around to keep playing. Should've put up a sign like that on the moon.
                    I've heard somewhere they also programmed it so that no matter what button you choose (orange or blue portal), it will be the correct portal on the moon matching the one that's already on the ground. Because people couldn't think which was the right color in the moment. I know I definitely didn't remember which one I should be pressing lol.
                        I remember hearing, probably in the commentary, that there are a few places that automatically switch the color of the last portal so that no matter which one you fire it's the right one. I think it's when you're in a funnel being projected into a portal.

And several of the long flings, if your speed is within a range it will adjust it to be exactly the right speed to make the landing.
                I still remember how I felt when I saw the moon. Just sheer excitement about what was about to happen when I fired that portal.
                    Truly one of the greatest moments in gaming. That shift from "oh wow, the moon" to "wait, what if--" to "HOLY SHIT THIS IS GODDAMNED EPIC" ... perfection.
                        Yeah, that's one of my all-time gaming HOLY SHIT moments.  Really great.
                    I wanted to say PORTALS ON THE MOON on my fb feed but I didn't wanna be a spoiler.
                This was a really well written analysis of why the moon reveal is so poignant and why I have never met anyone that didn’t get the reveal.
            I kinda agree, i think portal 1 was really a puzzle game with a really original story, while portal 2 was more a linear story game with puzzles.

For me the 2 was harder, i struggled a lot, especially with the "old" aperture with the gels and all
                Yeah, I see a lot of people say that the first was more challenging. But I breezed through most of those puzzles. The second was much harder for me when you get to the old section.
                    Portal was a freebie with the Half-Life 2 set that had all the HL2 games. I remember finishing the last of HL2 well after midnight and thinking "well let's see what Portal is" and it was just the nicest dessert after the long slog that is HL2. No headcrabs, no moaning zombie corpses that throw headcrabs at you, just some puzzles and that lovely wit.

*Are you still there?*
                        By dessert, you mean cake right?
                    That's mostly because when you played the first game, you weren't used to thinking with portals yet. By the sequel, you've had some experience and have already familiarized yourself with the concept.

Still found 2 harder though.
                There was gel puzzle or two that I still don't know if I did it right or if I just did it in a way that worked.
            Most of the more difficult puzzles in Portal 2 are in the co-op mode.
            weirdly enough, Portal 1 was more challenging, but it was a whole lot more intuitive for first-time players (maybe because its graphics were so basic?)

I'm saying this because I've seen people learning to 'think with portals' on both games, and the experience is different. On Portal 1, I had no need to explain what is happening, people always figure out what the portal gun does, and it was always fun to watch the brainfuck

On Portal 2, god, I've seen friends spend nearly an hour and not understanding what the portals do, until I had to explain it
            Check out portal stories: Mel for that good challenge
            I feel like Portal 1 had more reactionary puzzles which can be more difficult for some.  What I mean by that is more puzzles where you have to shoot another portal in mid air, usually with a relatively small target too.  I don't think portal 2 had as many as those...
            Yes, exactly!  Portal 2 was too damn easy throughout.  "Oh, it must be the only clean spot that I can shoot a portal on!"
                It's the tragedy of modern puzzle games where markers point out the answer. In the old Tomb Raider games you could spend ages on a tomb. Now it's a matter of looking for the white paint on the ledge and the glowing cliff face for you to climb. I think excesive play testing has killed challenging games.
            I agree sadly, since Portal 2 had a lot more mechanics, but I seemed to rely less on stretching possibilities because of this. The custom maps are damn hard, though.
        I like 1 a little more, personally. Aesthetically I don’t like how most of 2 is spent outside of functional testing chambers
            I actually love how the world was expanded upon in a way consistent with 1. Old Aperture is amazing, its whole feel is simultaneously nostalgic and foreboding and as you explore the story, it becomes moving. Then you return to the new laboratories and your relationship with GLaDOS has been changed radically.

None of the new characters introduced felt superfluous or like they ruin the vibe of 1, which to me is *incredible*. Overall tremendous writing in both games. 1 was lovely, but what 2 did with that story was just a masterpiece. It's been years and I'm still in love with the entire thing.
                I absolutely love the design of Old Aperture. All of the button illumination, checkboxes, and counters were Nixie tubes. And the test spheres have such a neat design to them.
                What I don’t like about 2 is how self aware it feels. Like a lot of the old aperture puzzles feel like you just need to search the huge room for 10 minutes to find the one white spot to put the portal on and solve the puzzle, but it’s framed as you’re outside the testing chambers in the open so there should be more possibilities? Something about it doesn’t feel right to me. Also personally Wheatley got really old.
                    Agreed - I loved the game and overall it was only a minor gripe for me, but the fact that it wasn't more "sandboxy" did take me out of the game a little bit.
                    Well the portals only work on surfaces covered with moon dust iirc
                        Yeah but it didn’t feel like you were exploring the world when there was always exactly one white panel exactly where you needed it. It makes the puzzles less satisfying, as opposed to 1 where for most puzzles you could put them almost anywhere but it wouldn’t accomplish anything if you didn’t have a plan
                            You are making some very solid points that I didn't even notice. Loved the game but yeah you are right.
                I completed the game in a single sitting. By the time I got to the old chambers I was getting real tired and taking so long to figure out the puzzles cause of it. But that only helped to make the atmosphere even mor emoody for me. So many good memories of this one.
            I totally get that. But the story also needed it to be the way it was.
    The unique mechanics and puzzles have allowed the game to stay fresh even after many years. I beat both games at least twice, and because there were some years between each time I completed it, I had to really think about how to solve the levels again
    even my kid loves it
    I was literally about to play both again today before I saw this post. Then I realized they aren't in my steam library anymore :(

Portal, along with Half-Life, was the first PC game I ever played. I'm using the same steam account. But it's gone from my library somehow.
        Did you out it as hidden maybe?
And if you go to the store page for portal, can you actually buy it? If so then it's indeed gone but maybe you can download fron there... Idunno
            First thing I did is went to the store and it makes me have to pay for it. I'm playing Half-Life right now, and its the same copy I had when I was a kid. So it's very weird.
                I just checked mine. Although I still have it the total playtime has been reset to 5 hours, and I have so much more than that put into it.
                    Yeah, my playtime on Half-Life got reset
        Do you have weird filters on your game library? I know that with some update, steam automatically created a filter for remote play games, so I thought I had lost a bunch of games when they weren't showing up in the main list.
    Both portal games are masterpiece works of art.
    It’s been 10 years since last of us got released and aged well. So why does it need a remake?
    It seemed really short on my second playthrough. I waited about 8 or 9 years but I still remembered too much to make the puzzles challenging again.
    I never finished portal 2, but I was v proud of completing the first one. I always thought I was too dumb for puzzle games. Even though defeating Glados took me a few tries, totally worth it to get to the end screen without any outside assistance.
    Still gives me nightmares to this day. (VR Version would be amazing)
    One game I've replayed time and time again.

First was amazing, but the second was such an experience. Amazing puzzles, characters, AND story, which you'd never really expect after the first game.
    I only just played it on my new PC build at the start of lockdown last year. Loads of fun. Even if friends mocked me for waiting so long.
    It was really cool back when my then-girlfriend had a laptop that could run the game and I had a PS3 and you got a free PC copy with the PS3 version, we found it pretty easy for us to play together with just that one purchase. Lots of fun.
    Yup. I've played through the Cave Johnson stages like 8 times (5 of them in a row within a week) because I just loved that storyline/jokes/Cave himself. Such a good game, with that section being amazing.
I'd love a Portal 3, but I assume we'll see that around the same time Half-life 3 comes out...
    HL 3, Portal 3, TF 3 - The Purple Box


Edit: I didn't forget L4D 3. It's basically already happening under a different name. Look up Back 4 Blood trailer. Same developers - Turtle Rock Studios.
        The Orange box 2
            *Break Into Orange Boogaloo*
            The Orange Box, Ep 1
            That's how you get threes from Valve: make them all a two
                This is starting to feel like the math classes I failed
        The dream
        Oh fuck please
            Happy cake day! Here's your free purple box!
                I had no idea it was my cake day. Thanks!!
                The cake is a lie!
        I would dump my life savings into that.
        They should use "Cube" instead of "Box". I know it's synonymous to box but math nerds will love it.
            It's not necessarily synonymous. Boxes can be rectangular solids too. They don't have to have equal sides like cubes do.
                Yeah but, cubed. The three 3 titles, dude was right, math nerds would love it lol, I do.
                    Not sure why this is downvoted but people may be missing the logic - 3 by 3 by 3 would be a cube
            It could ship inside of a used condom and I would still tear into it with both hands and a smile.
        I would put L4D 3 here too, but it's basically already being made under the name Back 4 Blood:

https://youtu.be/sG8-0UlzrEA
        Remember back when TF2 was a game you could buy. And no silly hats. Pepperidge Farm remembers
        I'm pre-ordering that... in my dreams
    Give Portal Stories: Mel a try. It's a free community-made story mod for Portal 2, has its own Steam page and everything.
        Also Portal Reloaded, it just came out today and it uses time travel as a mechanic. It is also on steam
            Downloading now, it looks interesting. Thanks for the heads up.
                No problem. It is a real mind fuck of a mod
            I'm still waiting for Valve to make their games 64-bit for Catalina.
        Definitely worth playing through. Very well made, good voice acting and story.
            I will also confirm this, as I played through it last year sometime. Definitely very well made and worth playing if you've played 1 and 2 and want more portal.

However, don't expect it to add anything game-changing. It's like an expansion pack on an existing game, more than any sort of subsequent installment. It is a mod, after all.
                It's huge though. I think it does a good job of showing the limits of the Portal concept/engine. By the end of Mel all the Portal'ing is spent in me and I'm ready for a break.   
Then in a year or two I go back and start all over at Portal 1
                Commenting on a portal thread on cake day! Nice! Happy cake day!
                    Pretty sure it was yesterday, but I'll take it! Playing Portal 1 right now too.
                        Well depending on how far you've got a long... The cake is a lie.. Or is it.
    It will come out, but it will be VR only!  
\[ Evil cackle \]
        To be fair, a Portal VR game would be insane
            Insane yes, but I'm not sure it's be that fun in VR. Doing a ceiling to floor loop into a jump might be a little bit jarring on the brain. Lol
                imagine the people gel that was scraped in Portal 2 made a reappearance in vr
                    You mean the gel that supposedly let you walk on walls?
                According to the developers, this is the exact reason why they dropped a VR Portal in favor of Alyx
                Sounds rather nauseating.  Those bits where you bounce up and down she does a little spin.
                As someone who gets serious simulation sickness, I feel nauseated just thinking about it.
            Oh im hoping it will happen for sure.  
There was a lot of angry screaming when Alyx came along though. :')
                it's been 10 years. i wouldn't count on it anymore
                Portal VR! Yay!

(Gets downvoted into oblivion)
        [deleted]
            I get motion sick in VR from just *walking.* I'm sure as hell not about to go jumping through ceilings and shit.
        That would be an insta-buy.
    We'll never see a Portal 3 because the main designers of the game no longer work for Valve.  Even if there is a new one, it wouldn't be the same.
        Just because it isn’t entirely the same doesn’t mean they couldn’t improve upon what worked with the other team and make it still a good game
            In theory of course you are completely correct.

In actuality, sequels of legendary games made by new teams almost never go well. Is there an example of it ever going well? I can't think of one.
                New vegas maybe?

                Oh wow. Master of Orion did this *twice*. Literally half the series is games made by a new team.
                Metroid Prime
                Well Portal 2, for one.
        Are the writers there at least? Because that's where the soul is.
            >>Unfortunately, most of the people who made Portal what it is are no longer at Valve. Kim Swift, who produced Narbacular Drop, the student game that eventually turned into Portal, left Valve in 2009 and now works for Electronic Arts. Writer Erik Wolpaw took off in early 2017 to work on Double Fine's Psychonauts 2, another long-awaited sequel. Chet Faliszek, Wolpaw's co-writer, left a few months later, saying that he needed a change of pace after spending 12 years at the company. Doug Wood, one of Portal 2's designers and animators, retired in 2016. Josh Weier, Portal 2's project lead, departed shortly thereafter.

most notable Portal developers left already
                Wolpaw was contracted to help out with writing Alyx, so temporary returns are possible.
                Kim Swift really downgraded there when it comes to integrity
                    I'll bet he's making more money though
        Most of the main designers of Portal 1 didn't work on Portal 2 and that turned out great, so I wouldn't worry too much about that.
        A few of them came back last year for unknown reasons

Don't get your hopes up though. They were great writers. Probably came back to help with HL:A
    [deleted]
        Away from home rn but gonna play it when I get back---how was it? I'm interested in difficulty in particular. Did the time portal feel like an added layer of complexity or more a gimmick? No specific spoilers, if you please.
            [deleted]
                Just watched. Awesome. Can't wait to get home.
    Portal 2 was originally going to have a different core mechanic, w/o GLaDOS, or Chell (Shell, like a terminal; Is she really GLaDOS's daughter?)... eventually they migrated back to the older puzzle elements.

See here for the full story, and glimpse of now unused "new" shutter mechanic they said they'd save for later... maybe for Portal 3?  [Portal 2: Creating a Sequel to a Game That Doesn't Need One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYFvwbby2YM)
    Yeah valve can't count that high, though my heart hurts saying that.
    Hell, right now I'd just settle for both of the Portal games on the Switch, that would be amazing.
    Or the heat death of the universe
    I hate to be the one possibly offering false hope but recently Valve did a collaboration with the Chalkeates YouTube channel on a song specifically about Valve counting to 3. Gabe himself personally offered a bit of voice work for it to boot

Now I still hold my doubts but maybe....... maybe Valve is alluding to them actually going back to old series with that? Maybe?
        I don't understand why they don't outsource them to a developer they trust maybe with some creative input.
            I think they're just not very interested anymore. Clearly certain people and divisions work on new games here and there, but it's been a long, long time since Valve needed to make games to rake in shitloads of money.
                Valve actually wanted to continue making games for a long time, they just had their idea of a flat work structure, where devs could basically choose on whatever project they want to do, which led to devs starting a massive amount of projects, but then never finishing them when they encounter larger problems. They finally fixed it with Alyx since they needed a release to advertise the Valve index.



There is the visual book series of a valve Dec called final hours: "insert game" who in the newest installment, Half-Life: Alyx - Final Hours mentioned (IIRC) three different attempts on making a half life three since portal 2 came out, which all failed to be developed fully.
    Valve makes money now, not games.
        I get that, but they should find an actual game developer that they trust and let them make the game. They could even keep some creative input if they wanted. It just seems stupid to have the IPs sit there. Then they can make even more money without even doing much.
    I have no mind fucking boggling clue why they haven’t made these games. 

They KNOW we’d all pay our right legs for them. So why not? Isn’t that what we’d call “big brain”? I don’t understand.. like wtf else are they doing even.
This is art. You will hear a buzzer.

When you hear the buzzer, stare at the art.
    You should now feel mentally reinvigorated.  If you suspect staring at art has not provided the required intellectual sustenance, reflect briefly on this classical music.

        Why did this make me sad
    I stand by my statement that those cores are Nolan North’s best work.
        I loved that the Anger Core in the original game was voiced by Mike Patton, the frontman of Faith No More
            You mean frontman of Mr. Bungle, Mondo Cane, Tomahawk, Fantomas, Moonchild, Dead Cross, and Hemophiliac, guest of Secret Chiefs 3, The Young Gods, Zu, and more? THAT Mike Patton? Dude's a slacker.
                I’m a Lovage kinda guy myself

[Portal Reloaded](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal_Reloaded/) just released today if any of yall are craving new portal content
    YESSS I'M SO EXCITED TO MELT MY BRAIN WITH TIME TRAVELLING PORTALS.
        Too bad it's just Zelda style "two timelines" time travel. Still, I bet it's filled with clever timey wimey puzzles. Gotta try it out!
            Honestly anything other than "two timelines" would be essentially impossible to make puzzles with without being absurdly, impossibly hard. Plus how'd you do that with portals? They're very binary things save in placement.
                Well maybe you could make a portal that goes one second in the past, allowing you to clone things? Or one second in the future, allowing you to dodge otherwise undodgeable attacks?
                    The thinking with time machine Portal 2 mod from forever ago is free on steam and adds this!
                        there's another portal time mod??? ohno
                            It’s been out since 2014, and it’s really challenging, fun, and free! [Here’s the steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286080/Thinking_with_Time_Machine/)
                    What I mean to say is the "ideal" test becomes impossible- either the mechanics are so broken the solution is too simple, or the solution is so complex that no one but the creator can ever do it.
    Hell yeah baby
    That’s awesome! I wish I had a PC
        What a shame, but you don't even need a good pc. So if xou hava school or work laptop you csn plsy wiht it
            You okay man? Maybe being on Reddit isn’t a good idea right now
            Most test subjects do experience some cognitive deterioration after a few months in suspension...
                Haha. I was tired
        Tbh I’m mad that Apple killed 32bit executables, but I’m more mad at Valve for not updating both Portals to run in 64bit. For a developer as big as Valve it would cost nothing, but I’m pretty sure they’re holding off for some power move bullshit with Apple.
    Any other Portal content you could recommend?
        "Portal stories : Mel" is another community created mod on steam.
        If you haven't already, the multiplayer collab in P2 is awesome. Takes it to another level. I only recently tried it for the first time now my son is old enough. I love that he gets the humour.
Played it for the first time last year, having realised there were a lot of older games I had never gotten around to playing.

Easily best game I've played recently. So funny, not too long, great mechanics, excellent story. Wish I could forget it and play again.
    Did you play the first Portal? It's very small compared to Portal 2, but worth playing.
        I did actually! Played them in order, loved it as well of course. Might have a cheeky replay of them soon!
            You should probably wait a little until you don’t remember much of the puzzles anymore
    Portal 1 & 2 are some of the few games I consider must plays for anyone getting into videya for sure. Actually had a tear at the end of 2
    I was late to play portal 1. Then thought aww what the hell and then it quickly became *Holy crap this is an amazing game*. 

Was anxious when Portal 2 came around excepting it to be an 'okay' sequel.

Then it absolutely blew me away. Those 2 games are a masterpiece.
        It really is, isn't it?  So many companies fail to capture lightning twice, and the sequel is just milquetoast.  Somehow Portal 2 managed to be distinct, and in a way, almost better?  It sounds wrong to say, they're both amazing games, and saying 2 is better in no way detracts from 1.  I suppose the best way I can liken it is that Portal 1 is like getting your most deeply-wanted gift for your birthday.  Portal 2 is also like that, but all of your favorite people are there to celebrate it with you, and you're going out to your favorite entertainment afterwords.
    > Wish I could forget it and play again.

This right here is the hallmark of a good game.
That ending was so fucking brilliant. >!When Glados sends you off, you think it's finally over, then you get confronted by a load of sentinels. You think, shit, it was a trap...but then they all start singing opera! Then that last moment when you walk outside, you hear that rumbling sound, and the companion cube comes out!<
    Very kind of you to spoiler tag the end of a 10 year old game. Not everyone has played a game that old and the ending is worth experiencing fresh.
        Shit it's just been so long that I didn't remember it very well at all. A replay is in needed quite badly.
            If you don't own it anymore it's very cheap. It's excellent even after this much time. My only caveat to it was that it didn't look as good as I remembered since I was playing on an HD monitor- I saw more hard polygon edges than I recalled, I saw some of the tricks they use to keep memory use down and make the lighting better than the engine can handle. 

I'd actually be curious what the game would look like if they did a remake with modern graphics- I wonder if there's a mod for that?
                Oh I definitely still own it. Just haven't played much of my 360 games ever since the XBone came out and then life started punching me in the face.

And yeah I just played through Halo 3 and felt the same way. Lots of edges everywhere that I don't remember.
            They could make a pile on a minimal-effort re-release. I’d love to be able to play it on a current gen console.
        Yup never played either Portal games, nor have I watched any playthroughs or watching or read anything about it. Maybe I should do a stream of it to record my virgin reactions.
    Fun Fact for those who didn't know: The Companion Cube you receive at the end of Portal 2 is the same one you incinerated in Portal 1 ~~you monster~~

1. It has burn marks on

2. Portal 1 and 2 have very different cube designs. It's not obvious at first, but if you compare them side-by-side, they're *very* different. The Companion Cube at the end of Portal 2 is the only cube in the whole game that uses the Portal 1 model
    perfect game
    And then you see the moon
        [deleted]
            The moonshot was just a brilliant scene. The focus shifting to it, the delay (I read it's the real speed of light to the moon delay), then just all hell breaks loose. Space core flying by. Definitely in my top 5 game moments in anything.
            Haha, I thought exactly the same! I remember thinking "Shit, no surfaces to portal on... but wait... is that the moon?! Would that work? It would be genius if it did..."
    Happy cake day!

...wait a minute...
    Based off of this ending, I always assumed portal 3 would be Glados' revenge on you for killing her in the first game. A long waited, calculated revenge she had to postpone in the second game to use you in the retaking of her facility. Well, for that, and to give you false hopes, of course. It would fit her personality too.
        I couldn't even imagine that the plot might be myself. So many possibilities, so little ability to count to 3...
    Funny enough, happy cake day
        Thank you! I promise I hadn't planned this all out from the offset.
"All right, I've been thinking, when life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade! Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager!

Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the man whose gonna burn your house down - with the lemons!"

One of the best written lines in any game ever. When I heard it, I literally paused the game to laugh for a minute or two.

10/10 both Portal 1 and 2
    GLaDOS completely breaking character to cheer him on was great
        I was so surprised to hear JK Simmons as voice of Cave Johnson, I really loved his work, also Stephen Merchant's work. 

And I loved the character of GlaDOS, loved her passive aggressiveness, how she keeps reminding Chell that she killed her mercilessly, her slow claps. 10/10 character writing.
            One of my favorite parts of the game is when you’re finally entering >!Wheatley’s Lair, and GLaDOS gives you the pep talk about revenge, and you realize that you’ve been completely forgiven for the events of the first game because otherwise you’d both get annihilated!<
        That’s what really makes the scene for me. The way she gets fired up while trapped in a potato perched on your portal gun.
            #Take the lemons! Burn his house down!
                It’s also not a bad “show don’t tell” type of scene. She starts reacting to a voice from her past and suddenly, she’s infantalized. She’s vulnerable. This ruthless AI wuvs her papa. It’s a great story-telling moment where she’s more human than AI. It makes the player empathize/sympathize with a computer.
    tl;dr Cave Johnson is Megaman
I recently played through them both the first time and boy was I happy to try it out :) I love the lore of the portal games

        yea I already did ;) They are great
         "Plus, we fire the whole bullet. Thats 65% more bullet per bullet."
        They shoot the whole bullet. They don’t waste any part of it
    Now do multiplayer in portal. Just absurd fun.
        already started ;) It really is. My friends are just not very online so it will take a while..
“You know, deleting Caroline just now taught me a valuable lesson. The best solution to a problem is usually the easiest one. And I'll be honest. Killing you? Is hard. You know what my days used to be like? I just tested. Nobody murdered me. Or put me in a potato. Or fed me to birds. I had a pretty good life. And then you showed up. You dangerous, mute lunatic. So you know what? You win. Just go.” *laughter* “It's been fun. Don't come back."
I want Portal 3 guys
    The ending, though. It's just perfect. Think about how rare perfect endings to any story are. I don't want that spoiled — I'm satisfied and want to stay that way.
        So they can bring it back with the AI robots.  Plenty of good ways to continue it without ruining the original story.
        I want Chell to meet up with Gordon Freeman.  


That drydock in "Olde Aperture" .... Blew. My. Mind.
    Me too, kid. 

If you want some amazing Portal content; Portal Stories: Mel, Portal Facility (I think that's the name, never played it but heard very good things), And Portal Reloaded (which came out today, good luck- you have to think 4 dimensionally) are all excellent ways to see more Portal content that are complete games. The puzzles are more difficult in the unofficial mod games not because they're harder but because they're more obtuse and kind of poorly communicated sometimes. While playing Mel I found myself struggling through puzzles because the intercom guy (his name is Virgil, the voice acting is pretty solid, they don't try to imitate any characters from the previous games which is good) told me to hurry and the alarm blared every 2 minutes and the whole building shook periodically *while I was trying to solve the puzzle*. That's honestly my only gripe. I'm installing Reloaded tonight and I'm excited to melt my brain with 4 dimensional pickles.

Edit: my first line isn't trying to be condescending I'm referencing the Incredibles.
LOL i literally got it today and started playing without knowing this
    All of us who've ever played Portal 2 read your comment with envy.
10...years..😔

        Truly
    I remember getting the game for Christmas on PC in its release year.
Well here we are again
    It's always such a pleasure
        Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
            Oh how we laughed and laughed
                Except I wasn’t laughing
                    Under the circumstances I’ve been shockingly nice
Portal Reloaded just came out today you guys. It's free - https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal_Reloaded/
[deleted]
    If that is making you feel old, just imagine what it'll be like when someone calls a good game that came out when you were in your early 30s their childhood game...
Welp, time find my disc and speedrun it again (and by speedrun I mean beat it in one sitting I’ve never gotten close to a shitty speedrun time lol)
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZOtBNL0z2I

I think the final speedrunners got the last level down to like 35 seconds or something like that. If memory serves, they had a way to break through the ceiling and "fly" (noclip) up to the final battle, bypassing the turret room.
        That was impressive af (even tho any% is crazy and cool as shit I still like glitchless runs the best)
            [deleted]
                4 hours later and I got to hear that sweet ending song, I forgot how good portal 2 was
Every time I look at the moon, I think about this game fondly.
    "NOOOOOO!!!"
The cake was a lie
    Lies. I ate the cake. It was delicious and moist.
    They retconned cake back in, a robot hand snuffs out the candle.
    Much like those the Beatles, fans have an interesting way of ruining great things
That moment in the final battle when you're just about to be defeated.

and you just *know* what you need to do.

no game has ever given me the feeling I had in that moment so strongly before or since.
    I like not shooting initially. Wheatley says something like:

'That's it, take one last look at your precious moon'
    Doesn’t the screen point you straight at the moon? It’s been a while since I played, but I remember it being very obvious what to do.
        To be fair I was in my teens and have had other games hit me in other ways like Nier:Automata
Ah dammit, I almost had a heart attack thinking the VR version was about to happen. :(
_Now I only want you gone_ ♫
Here I am, happy that portal 2 was so good, yet pissed off portal 3 never happened
    In a way I understand why it won't. They made the tools for people to mod whole games into being and make/share levels- it's the same reason why after Mario Maker 2 I suspect Nintendo will never make another 2d Mario game. They've shown us everything they can think to in level designs within the constraints of the game's premise and, in a way, taught us everything they know about that particular genre. Giving us the creation tools is them saying, "that's all we know, now you get to show others what you can do." In the Valve case, they've also told the stories they want to tell and left the rest of the lore open to speculation, invention, and our imaginations.
        Yeah, that makes total sense. I still wish it could come out tho lol
            Will not happen ever. I would eat a raw uncooked boot before it ever did and you can hold me to that
just started playing portal 1 a few hours ago, can't wait to start the second after finishing the first.
So. How are you holding up? CAUSE IM A POTATO
I played the whole thing through in one sitting for the anniversary. Yep, still my favourite game of all time.
I thought this game came out like 5 years before Skyrim damn.
June 15th of this year will be when the test shaft is sealed.
    Huh? Is this a HL/Portal timeline thing?
        Yup. I got it mixed up a bit though. This year will be 50 years since it was sealed

https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Test_Shaft_09
Someone just released a portal 2 mod, it's free on steam, just look up Portal Reloaded on the steam store. It's really fun and the puzzles so far are waaaay harder because they ad a 3rd portal that allows you to travel to the future and to the present
    >3rd portal that allows you to travel to the future and to the present

Wait that's illegal
That game proves that video games can be art
Portal VR when?
    I'm extraordinary confident if you looked around a VR mod has already been made. 

Although you might vom as you fly through the air.
        lol yea I figured it more as a joke. But it would be fun if motion sick wasn't an issue. 

https://store.steampowered.com/app/446750/Portal_Stories_VR/

from 2016, dang
            That’s not really portal though is it? Aside from using the same graphical assets, it’s has barely anything in common as the gameplay changes a lot. I’m not sure an actual portal game would work in VR.
                What do you mean? It is a community made mod, so its not like its from valve but its a mod of portal. And yea I have now idea how it is, I just thought I would post as he mentioned a mod was already made.
                    I know it’s just a mod, I’m saying the gameplay has nothing to do with portal. Aside from using the same assets to make it look visually the same, it has nothing to do with Portal.

In other words, if this game had different art and was released standalone, I would never think “damn this reminds me so much of portal!”
                        Oh dam so there's no portals in it?
                            Yep, for some reason someone thought that was a good idea
                                Well thanks for clearing that up. Take it off my game list for when I finally get VR
                                    No problem! 

No need to take it off though, it’s still entertaining for a while and since it’s super small (less than 30 minutes I think?) and free, you don’t lose anything trying it :) it’s just a bit frustrating to play because you’ll be thinking “damn, they had such a good opportunity to make portal in vr why did they do it this way?”
Played it last year for the first time, kick ass game!!!
You guys should try Portal Reloaded :D
    Oooo have you played it yet? I've been dying to I'm installing it after work. How is it?
        Bit trippy til you get used to it 😅, In my head I was thinking the opposite in terms of the 4d but really neat concept. Small thing was the aspect ratio thing was messed up for me and couldn't get it to fully fit my screen properly 🤷‍♂️
        My brain melted from the puzzles
I lost my copy on the Xbox 360, which makes me so sad. I am super careful about my belongings, and have a huge library, but this one title managed to elude me somehow...and now I am sad. Here's hoping it'll get a re-release for home consoles soon, otherwise there's always STEAM.
    Portal Reloaded is free on steam from what I hear.

Never played the game, but always wanted to. Now that I'm out of the sunken place, I'll have to put it on the list!!
        You need the base game tho
The absolute best game I have ever had the privilege of playing.
This post right here, is my first instance of "wow im getting old" feels like maybe 2-3 years ago this came out
    You’re forgetting that January 2020 was like 10 years ago
Still remember the Christmas afternoon/evening when my brother and I marathoned the co-op after opening it. 

Any other recommendations for these types of games on Xbox? I’ve played Pneuma, Turing Test, and Call of the Sea and would recommend them all as puzzlers.
    It’s not on game pass but have you tried The Witness? I enjoyed that a lot. It’s a fun and sometimes tough puzzle game. It’s been a while since I had to break out a pencil and paper for a video game. 

How did call of the sea turn out? I lost interest and gave up after I encountered some bug/glitch early on. I couldn’t advance through a puzzle and had to YouTube a walkthrough. If I didn’t do that I would still be stuck in the game.
        I really enjoyed it but I also didn’t experience any bugs. The story was just intriguing enough to keep me interested and I liked the puzzle design. I played through the whole thing in a weekend
        I'll second The Witness. Literally broke my brain for a few weeks after I got to a certain point.
    If you have literally any PC made in the last 5 years it 100% can run Portal 2 and all of the mods people have made. Many of those mods are full on games in themselves and they definitley bring the same spark back that the originals did.
        lol nope all I’ve got is a 2013 MacBook and the new Xbox. Looking to build one soon whenever graphics cards are reasonably obtainable
    Absolutely would recommend checking out The Talos Principle if you haven't already.
Maybe now we can have that fucking cake
I wish they would make 3
I played it with my gtx 780.  Maybe inshould try it again with my rtx 2080.
    I doubt it would make a difference. The GTX 780 could probably max it out no prob.
Just finished playing it again today. Bawled my eyes out at the ending. Man I long back to those days. This game has such care put into it and what a ride it is. Valve are masters of their craft
I’ve always wanted to play portal 2 and i bought it last week and finished it a couple days ago. Probably one of the best games I’ve ever played.
This has always been a problem with Valve. When they make games, alot ofnthem turn out to be all time greats but they tend to not do a third sequel for whatever reason.
    They haven't make their own game in years save Alyx- if they don't announce anything today about anything Portal related, I am confident that they will never make another portal game ever again. I think a lot of the reason their games are so incredibly popular is because 1) they make great games with solid mechanics and 2) they show tiny glimpses into these intricate, aesthetically intriguing worlds but hold most of the cards close to their chest. Hell, to this *day* we know virtually n o t h i n g about G-man.

That being said I think keeping all the cards close they can provide people modding tools (Gary's mod) and stage builders (Portal 2's community level system) and people can use those to create new stories inside the world they established. I am actually super surprised after they released the plot for Half Life 3 (remember when that happened? It was *crazy*!) that no one ever made the game using Gary's mod (or at least I never heard about it). 

The unfortunate trade off with this, however, is that if they ever showed their full hand for the way the world works, they'd eternally ruin the infinite possibilities fan games/mods allow. And making a proper HL3 or Portal 3 would do exactly that. 

So while I will gradually move further away from  experiencing a Portal game for the first time indefinitely, I am grateful for the community these games have fostered and the memories we can all share.
That game was so good, I finished it after a few days and believe me I was so happy
i love glados, she is one of my all time favorite NPC's
Feels like a lot less than 10
To think it was a Ps3 game!
I want a ps4 re-release. Bonus points for a VR mode
HALF PORTAL 3 CONFIRMED
I named my computer GLaDOS for her <3

Is it still worth playing it for the first time ?
    Absolutely, it's one of the best games of all time.
    Absolutely
I sat down and played the game in one sitting, took about 8-9 hours. I played it not long after it came out so did it without any guides etc, I still remember coming face to face with that huge vault door and discovering the ship!
This has been my lockscreen in my office for years now.
    Post the full image?

>It's been 10 years since the masterpiece that is Portal

Yeah that makes sense-

> 2 was released.

O\_O
I remember seeing pretty much all of my friends on steam playing this when it was released. Such a great game
Does anyone know if there’s a 1440p or higher version of that pic? It would make a fine addition to my wallpaper collection
On the plus side: [https://xkcd.com/606/](https://xkcd.com/606/)
Well here we are again
Recently I replayed this, it is such a good game. Also 10 years ago it came out and weeks ago, I introduced my 10yo to it. He loved it.
Still play it to this day
I remember everyone going absolutely insane over the ARG that Valve had going on leading up to the game’s release... can’t believe that was 10 years ago.
10/10 Would run trials for cake again.
Two games that I don´t get tired of playing: Portal 2 and The Talos Principle.
God dammit please remaster it

I want to play it on my ps5
Start buying VR in bulk, that's how we will get HL 3
I scrolled past and saw this, thought it was an ad and scrolled back up in hopes of see in the "PROMOTED" tag line.

But Alas... no such luck.
Sadly valve can't count to three
And today marks the day Portal Reloaded is released. Utterly mind boggling is all I'm saying.
Crazy thing is, this past weekend I played through Portal and had my girlfriend play through Portal 2 because she had never seen/played either. 
She loved them (knew she’d love the sarcastic GLaDOS) and then we learned it was the 10 year anniversary!

What masterpieces....
I still fondly remember steam's potato harvest event leading up to it, best launch event ever
RIP Valve, the game developer.
    Why make games when others will pay you to host theirs?
I feel like I retained every word of this game. Especially that lemon rant 🍋
was this really such a good game?
This was a triumph...
It's been a long road, getting from there to here... But I've got faaaith of the... No, wait...
Bummed it's not on the ps4.
Portal 3 when
    When someone in valve learns to count to 3...
It's been a long time- shouldn't have left you, without a blue portal to step through
Played the 2 player with my roommate a year ago. One of the greats for sure
I'd say this is the last game that I got really excited for before it came out and felt like I had to play through as fast as I could. At the time I was working few hours after graduating from college and was virtually broke. I remember skipping meals when I could to save money just to afford the game and play. It was worth every meal skipped. Think I played it about 8 times through in the first 2 months of having it.
Easily my favourite game ever.
Maybe it's time. It's been a decade of sitting in my steam library unused. I will play it this weekend so help me God!
    It’s worth it. Do it.
I played this originally on PS3. Just bought it on steam just for the anniversary
Portal and Portal 2 still remains one of my all time favorite games, I’d even say probably top five but at least top 10 and that’s a lot considering a life (28) of franchises that have worked their way into my heart!.... Zelda will always be number 1
Value cant count to 3
And now there's this as of yesterday!  


[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal\_Reloaded/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal_Reloaded/)
I've been hoping against hope that they will release a remastered edition (since there will never be a Portal 3). I want to play it again but I'd have to bust out my PS3 and I don't really feel up to riding that nostalgic rollercoaster.
    I don't think valve would do it but who knows, they did allow the black mesa remake to be made
        Yeah, I'm not holding my breath. If they'd just allow the game to be streamed, I'd be happy.

Note: it might already be allowed but not on the PSN.
    Just buy it on Steam. Its $10 and practically any PC can run it now.
        You think so? I just built my computer a month ago but I can't get my hands on a GPU (fucking miners).
            A modern iGPU can run it pretty well. Even the iGPU of the i5 6600t can run it at reduced resolution. My laptop with Iris XE iGPU can run it maxed out at 1080p.
I still would love to get a portal 3 I love the portal games there so fun
It truly was a masterpiece.
I honestly want Portal 3 more than Half Life 3, I want them both, I just want Portal 3 more.
Such a shame Valve can't count to 3. They count money pretty well though.
Half portal life 3!
A game so ahead of its time, I question cake every opportunity I’m able to.

    Some fun bit of trivia, ‘when life gives you lemons’ isn’t a common saying in France, so French Cave Johnson goes on a completely separate and hilarious tirade about how when life is a Big Bad Wolf trying to blow your house down you should cut the wolf’s legs off.
        Je vais ordonner à mes ingénieurs de monter des rotules sur ta maison pour pouvoir les lui péter !
            This is exceptionally pleasing to me. I now wish to replay this masterpiece en francais.
    Damn, that flows really well. Now I wanna hear him say it this way.
    He’s saying what we’re all thinking!!!
    I've always loved GLaDOS's little weak supporting cheers that play in the background when the player listens to cave's rants lol.
    AND YOU LEAVE MY MOTHER OUT OF THIS!

Sorry about the mess. I've really let the place go since you killed me. By the way, thanks for that.

 Oh good, that's back online.
Hey, how are you holding up? Because I'm a potato!
I had a pretty good life. And then *you* showed up. You dangerous, mute, lunatic.
    So you know what? You win!! Just go.....
It's been fun, don't come back

            I love Cara Mia Addio so much. Ellen McClain improvised a lot of the Italian on the spot.
                It was so good! I play through the game every once in a while just to hear "The Turret Concierto!"
            Should've been the actual ending credits song, imo.
                Idk want you gone still gives me chills every time I hear it
                    Yes. Want you gone and Still alive are so brilliant
                    Unpopular opinion, i know.  But "Want You Gone" doesnt hit the same as "Still Alive."
    I’m like 90% sure the quote is “You **dangerous**, Mute, Lunatic.”

But I could just be misremembering
        The right woman in the wrong place, can make all the difference in the world.
same too me
A potato?
Is there a deeper meaning to the lyrics or is it all just referring to the relationship between Glados and Chell?
    That’s the whole meaning, there’s also the sub context of her being Caroline, and possibly chells mother.
        Zoinks, Chell's mom?
            There’s a whole thing on glades and thus Caroline and cave Jonson actually being chells mom it’s never been proven tho and even Glados’s actress dosnt know.

(EDIT) Im updating this since I honestly didn’t expect this to gain so much attention. 

The whole chells mom thing is a popular theory that hasn’t been proven, the only hints are cara Mia (turret opera) and Easter eggs. Glados’s voice actor has stated tho that cara Mia was her own idea it was also done from her memory Latin as a kid hence why the translation is bad as it’s mostly not recognizable. 

Look into it if your curious it’s a fun ride.
                I believe the developers said that Glados wasn't part of the original project, but that the test players felt the game needed an antagonist, so they added it
                    This was also extremely early on in development
                        Glados made the game.
                            Agreed
                            It really did. Even if they just had an announcer (and even a good one like Cave Johnson) the game would have lacked the soul it has now.
                                Go  play the  addon mel  on steam  cave jonhson talk most of the time
                            Actually, Valve did.
                                Did you know the cake is a lie?
                            Absolutely. Some dialogue interactions had me dieing laughing. Also I guess we can't really call it interactions because we never do respond to Glados, ever. So she is really talking to herself. Such a great game.
                        The game ended up VERY different from how it started out :-) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narbacular_Drop

There’s actually a playable version of the original somewhere in the intertubes.
                            The same school had another student game called "Tag:The Power of Paint" iirc. In it you had a gun that painted surfaces with different colors, which would change how that surface reacted to the player.

One color would make you run fast, anther would make you bounce off the surface, and a third would make you stick to it and rotate your perspective.

Valve hired that group of students and put the concept into Portal 2.
                                Ah!  Cool to know. Digipen seems to have had some pretty good students.
                            I remember playing this! I always said portal was a copy. I never remembered the name, and people doubted it's existence, but here it is!
                            Was free way back. I played it at some point or another.
                    the test players felt the game needed ~~an antagonist~~ a beacon of light
                >cave Jonson actually being chells mom

CAVE JOHNSON IS HER MOM?
                    My engineers tried telling me drinking moon rock gel would make me infertile.  To hell with them I say! Just to prove them wrong, I'll have my own damn kid,  and when I do it,  I'm going to be both the father and the mother! Let's get to some science.
                        It's been 10 years, but I can still hear that man's voice in my head.
                            I'm willing to bet it's been less than 10 years since you've heard JK Simmons' voice, though.
                                The man is a freaking treasure. He seems to just really embrace the crazy in every part he plays.
                            Me too, just now it has to do with insurance
                            This is true! 😂
                            Do you know who I am?

I'm the man whos gonna burn your house down!

With the lemons!
                        Why does this make me feel it's more likely as opposed to less likely?
                    Hey gang! Cave Johnson here! 

I'm just popping in to clear up some confusion. There have been some rumors that I have been engaging in relationships with Aperture employees that would be considered inappropriate for the workplace. Let me assure you, these rumors are absolutely false. There have also been rumors that I may or may not have sired certain children with certain people who may or may not have been my personal assistant, who I may or may not have arranged to be digitally copied to develop an AI to run the company once I finally succumb to this terrible illness that may or may not have been caused by powered moon rocks that I may or may not have also tried snorting one time in the 80's while trying to find new marketable applications for existing products. Let me assure you, that these rumors are absolutely true - but only under well defined probabilistic scenarios.

Let me explain. See, a few years back the boys in engineering started having trouble coming up with new ideas for products. We tried everything! We tried a portal gun with one entrance and two exits. We tried a new gel that makes literally anything it touches spontaneously combust. We even had a period where we considered getting back to our roots, so to speak, and making shower curtains again! Eventually we settled on the last idea we'd ever need, the Aperture Science Perpetual Testing Initiative. Now that we have access to the multiverse, we no longer need to come up with ideas, we can just steal them from some other version of ourselves! So what does this have to do with the rumors from earlier? Well, there are infinite multiverses, each with differences that could be minor, such as one guy having a minor corporate policy violation that's being blown way out of proportion by HR, or they could be significant changes affecting the entire human race. Case in point, the Cave Johnson addressing you right now is actually not human at all, but from a multiverse where everyone is actually a ferret. So you see, given the infinite variables between infinite multiverses, there is almost certainly one where the events being described have come to pass. But it's not this one! Nope! No sir! I give you my word. And it's like my father always told me, "Cave, a ferret that can't give you their word isn't a ferret, but a weasel." 

Anyway, I think that should clear up all of the confusion, so I won't bother talking about how you can contact me if you have anymore questions, since obviously there won't be any. 

Thanks,
-- Cave
                        You are a delight

                Really? I just played through it again recently and I thought they were pretty clear about glados being her mother.
                Wasn't Glados played by multiple actors?
                    No, GLaDOS was voiced by a single person, Ellen McLain.
                        I thought the singer from Faith No More voiced one of her personalities in Portal 2
                            Nah, this is his starring role in the game

                    Damn just downvote this guy for being curious lol
                        I found that a bit interesting.
                        Proper reddit etiquette is to answer with words instead of downvotes!
            There's a part in the game where you come across science projects created by the kids of the workers, and one of them is signed by "Chell".

Could be just a random easter egg, but it's likely that she's at least the daughter of *someone* who worked there.
                True, but it's also canon that she's adopted. Cave Johnson and Caroline could well be her biological parents though.
                    GLaDOS *says* she's adopted, but GLaDOS talks mad shit.
                        Yes, but the context, both GLaDOS and Wheatley say she's adopted. GLaDOS could simply have denied it, but she didn't, in fact she confirmed it, and *sympathized* with Chell about it.
                    Is it? I don't really fully trust whatever GLaDOS says.
                        Both Wheatley and GLaDOS state it as fact, and at that point GLaDOS is on Chell's side.
                            Oh, I didn't remember that.

Still, they didn't say *when* she was adopted, did they? She can be a worker's adopted daughter, no?
        Very likely Chell's mother. Per the Ratman comics, Doug took her as his own to hide the fact that the boss and his assistant were having an affair.
            Portal 2 is one of my all time favorite games, but I have no idea what you just said.
                Doug Rattmann is the guy that wrote all the cake is a lie graffiti in the games. An old aperture science employee that survived glados killing everyone and went crazy living in the walls of the facility. 

They put out some comics called Ratman about Rattmann. I havent read them, so I can't tell you what happens in them. But seems like this person is saying Rattmann was chell's adopted parent? Raising her instead of Cave and Caroline? This is the first i'm hearing about it too. Not crazy about the idea.
                    He was schizophrenic and ran out of meds.
                There's a comic book (I believe it's just called "Ratman"), where in we see Doug Ratman, the man who left all of the messages behind the walls in both games (as he slowly went insane). In the comic, it's revealed that his daughter was taken at take your daughter to work day (the day Glados was turned on) into the test subject pool. I haven't read it myself but it's apparent in the comic that 1) his daughter isn't biologically his 2) he "adopted" her from a coworker 3) he's resentful toward Cave & Caroline through his career. Putting that together, it's pretty strongly implied that Chell is the abandoned daughter of Caroline and Cave who was raised by Ratman (also why Glados relentlessly calls you adopted).
                    Ohhh GladOS is that cold.
                    That's pretty far off into crazy fan-theory land, though, and I think you're just misremembering; the take you daughter to work day isn't in the comic at all, and the same comic has him bumping Chell up to #1 on the list of test subjects for Portal 1 because the reason she was originally rejected from testing altogether was that her "tenacity" score was off the charts. Nothing in the text states or implies he knows her at all, much less that she's his adopted kid- the companion cube asks how he knew about her and says "know what?" and it was "something in her file". He's not trying to save her at that point (he is trying to save her after she's recaptured at the end of Portal 1), he's just picking someone out of the files that can fight back.
                        thank you for the clarification, I must be misremembering.
            GLaDOS is likely Chell's mom. Chell's Potato Battery science fair display is visible from the Bring Your Daughter To Work Day, so she was certainly the daughter of an employee.
        But Caroline is American and Cave Johnson is American, so it doesn't make sense because Chell is asian
            Caroline's last name can't be Li? Have you never met an Asian person who "sounded American"?
                Here's an [in-game portrait](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/half-life/images/0/07/Cave_caroline_70s.png/revision/latest?cb=20120621160408&path-prefix=en) of the two of them. I wouldn't say she looks particularly asian.
                    Clearly this image is quite off. Doesn't look anything like the teacher from Whiplash.
                        But it kinda resembles that guy from that prison documentary
                I am Asian
                    I am Groot
            When is this ever stated lol. If anything Chell looks a little like Caroline when you think about it.
                "Chell is modeled after actress Alésia Glidewell, and appears to be of mixed-race white European and East or Southeast Asian background, with dark hair and blue eyes."

                    Wow that's interesting! Thanks.
                        I went to college with her.
                            Nice.
                        No problem
She was a lot like you - maybe not quite as heavy.
Do you want me to go back and listen to the songs from both portal games repeatedly? Because that’s how you get me to go back and listen to the songs from both portal games repeatedly.

Edit - I’m making a note here, huge success.

Edit edit - I choose to believe that Caroline is
Chell’s mother because it makes that song so beautiful. Sure there are the GLaDOS lines, like “except I wasn’t laughing” and “maybe not quite as heavy”, “oh did you think I meant you”

And then there are the Caroline lines that have me crying in a cafe right now:
- you want your freedom, take it, that’s what I’m counting on
- one day they woke me up so that I could live forever, it’s such a shame the same will never happen to you
- you’ve got your short, sad life left, that’s what I’m counting on

And the telltale from GLaDOS herself, “when I delete you maybe I’ll stop feeling so bad”


Edit edit edit - it’s such a beautifully right bit of writing. If you listen to it as the voice of a frenemy computer every line makes sense as a sarcastic barb. But if you listen to it as the voice of a dead, uploaded mother pushing to the surface of the mind she’s trapped in it is achingly beautiful.
    You and me both I love the mother theory but it’s shaky as there are some holes like their appearances that don’t work well.

        Where do you find this gloriously obnoxious tune??!!
One of the most memorable sets of video game characters I have seen, and one of them doesn't even speak.
    "You crazy, mute, lunatic."
        Stephen Merchant should have been cast as Vision in the MCU.
            He was very good in Logan (2017) as Caliban
    To be fair, you only see Chell slightly more often than you hear her.
        If that is how you play you mean. You can see her everytime you open a portal!
            Not every time. You only see yourself if the other portal faces your current position.
                \*sigh\* You are technically correct. The best kind of correct.
    I wouldn’t say Chell is memorable, unless of course you’re talking about the companion cube
        Wait, Chell is the companion cube? How? Time travel? Cloning?
Heck, even Portal 1 has aged well. Helps a lot that the graphics are pretty simple, but overall I think it's a testament to the quality of the Source engine, not to mention the great writing and voice acting.
    When I played both games back to back, I noticed that the puzzles in the first game are notably more challenging. With Portal 2 I found there was a lot more hints to the solutions.
        Portal 2 had more challenging puzzles but design that led you to grow into the puzzles very smoothly. There were still plenty of moments of having to work things out (at least for me).

But portal 2 also contains probably the greatest “puzzle” design of all time. They seed the moon rock = portal carrier stuff into the game just enough to lodge it in your head without making it feel like a Chekhov’s Gun. So when you’re in your death throes and the the ceiling opens to show the moon, the solution is instantly obvious and yet allows the player to feel smart in that moment. And the satisfaction from seeing your portal glint off the moon (I think they showed that portals propagate at c) was immense.
            Funny story: they calculated how long it should take to see the glint (because of the speed of light) but they couldn't use it because it was too slow and a lot of players looked away before they saw it.
                2.6 seconds is an eternity for a gamer
                    More like 5 seconds for the round trip, assuming the gun works at the speed of light.
                        But it only takes 1.3 to get to the moon and 1.3 for the light to come back.
                            Huh, you're right. I've been off by a factor of 2 for years.
                    Fuck I just laughed out loud on a bus with only one other person and they are looking at me like I am strange.
                There's a sign in 2 that says something like: In case of reactor implosion, look directly at implosion. 

AFAIK they put that sign in because they worked hard on the animation of the implosion and play testers never saw it because they turned around to keep playing. Should've put up a sign like that on the moon.
                I've heard somewhere they also programmed it so that no matter what button you choose (orange or blue portal), it will be the correct portal on the moon matching the one that's already on the ground. Because people couldn't think which was the right color in the moment. I know I definitely didn't remember which one I should be pressing lol.
                    I remember hearing, probably in the commentary, that there are a few places that automatically switch the color of the last portal so that no matter which one you fire it's the right one. I think it's when you're in a funnel being projected into a portal.

And several of the long flings, if your speed is within a range it will adjust it to be exactly the right speed to make the landing.
            I still remember how I felt when I saw the moon. Just sheer excitement about what was about to happen when I fired that portal.
                Truly one of the greatest moments in gaming. That shift from "oh wow, the moon" to "wait, what if--" to "HOLY SHIT THIS IS GODDAMNED EPIC" ... perfection.
                    Yeah, that's one of my all-time gaming HOLY SHIT moments.  Really great.
                I wanted to say PORTALS ON THE MOON on my fb feed but I didn't wanna be a spoiler.
            This was a really well written analysis of why the moon reveal is so poignant and why I have never met anyone that didn’t get the reveal.
        I kinda agree, i think portal 1 was really a puzzle game with a really original story, while portal 2 was more a linear story game with puzzles.

For me the 2 was harder, i struggled a lot, especially with the "old" aperture with the gels and all
            Yeah, I see a lot of people say that the first was more challenging. But I breezed through most of those puzzles. The second was much harder for me when you get to the old section.
                Portal was a freebie with the Half-Life 2 set that had all the HL2 games. I remember finishing the last of HL2 well after midnight and thinking "well let's see what Portal is" and it was just the nicest dessert after the long slog that is HL2. No headcrabs, no moaning zombie corpses that throw headcrabs at you, just some puzzles and that lovely wit.

*Are you still there?*
                    By dessert, you mean cake right?
                That's mostly because when you played the first game, you weren't used to thinking with portals yet. By the sequel, you've had some experience and have already familiarized yourself with the concept.

Still found 2 harder though.
            There was gel puzzle or two that I still don't know if I did it right or if I just did it in a way that worked.
        Most of the more difficult puzzles in Portal 2 are in the co-op mode.
        weirdly enough, Portal 1 was more challenging, but it was a whole lot more intuitive for first-time players (maybe because its graphics were so basic?)

I'm saying this because I've seen people learning to 'think with portals' on both games, and the experience is different. On Portal 1, I had no need to explain what is happening, people always figure out what the portal gun does, and it was always fun to watch the brainfuck

On Portal 2, god, I've seen friends spend nearly an hour and not understanding what the portals do, until I had to explain it
        Check out portal stories: Mel for that good challenge
        I feel like Portal 1 had more reactionary puzzles which can be more difficult for some.  What I mean by that is more puzzles where you have to shoot another portal in mid air, usually with a relatively small target too.  I don't think portal 2 had as many as those...
        Yes, exactly!  Portal 2 was too damn easy throughout.  "Oh, it must be the only clean spot that I can shoot a portal on!"
            It's the tragedy of modern puzzle games where markers point out the answer. In the old Tomb Raider games you could spend ages on a tomb. Now it's a matter of looking for the white paint on the ledge and the glowing cliff face for you to climb. I think excesive play testing has killed challenging games.
        I agree sadly, since Portal 2 had a lot more mechanics, but I seemed to rely less on stretching possibilities because of this. The custom maps are damn hard, though.
    I like 1 a little more, personally. Aesthetically I don’t like how most of 2 is spent outside of functional testing chambers
        I actually love how the world was expanded upon in a way consistent with 1. Old Aperture is amazing, its whole feel is simultaneously nostalgic and foreboding and as you explore the story, it becomes moving. Then you return to the new laboratories and your relationship with GLaDOS has been changed radically.

None of the new characters introduced felt superfluous or like they ruin the vibe of 1, which to me is *incredible*. Overall tremendous writing in both games. 1 was lovely, but what 2 did with that story was just a masterpiece. It's been years and I'm still in love with the entire thing.
            I absolutely love the design of Old Aperture. All of the button illumination, checkboxes, and counters were Nixie tubes. And the test spheres have such a neat design to them.
            What I don’t like about 2 is how self aware it feels. Like a lot of the old aperture puzzles feel like you just need to search the huge room for 10 minutes to find the one white spot to put the portal on and solve the puzzle, but it’s framed as you’re outside the testing chambers in the open so there should be more possibilities? Something about it doesn’t feel right to me. Also personally Wheatley got really old.
                Agreed - I loved the game and overall it was only a minor gripe for me, but the fact that it wasn't more "sandboxy" did take me out of the game a little bit.
                Well the portals only work on surfaces covered with moon dust iirc
                    Yeah but it didn’t feel like you were exploring the world when there was always exactly one white panel exactly where you needed it. It makes the puzzles less satisfying, as opposed to 1 where for most puzzles you could put them almost anywhere but it wouldn’t accomplish anything if you didn’t have a plan
                        You are making some very solid points that I didn't even notice. Loved the game but yeah you are right.
            I completed the game in a single sitting. By the time I got to the old chambers I was getting real tired and taking so long to figure out the puzzles cause of it. But that only helped to make the atmosphere even mor emoody for me. So many good memories of this one.
        I totally get that. But the story also needed it to be the way it was.
The unique mechanics and puzzles have allowed the game to stay fresh even after many years. I beat both games at least twice, and because there were some years between each time I completed it, I had to really think about how to solve the levels again
even my kid loves it
I was literally about to play both again today before I saw this post. Then I realized they aren't in my steam library anymore :(

Portal, along with Half-Life, was the first PC game I ever played. I'm using the same steam account. But it's gone from my library somehow.
    Did you out it as hidden maybe?
And if you go to the store page for portal, can you actually buy it? If so then it's indeed gone but maybe you can download fron there... Idunno
        First thing I did is went to the store and it makes me have to pay for it. I'm playing Half-Life right now, and its the same copy I had when I was a kid. So it's very weird.
            I just checked mine. Although I still have it the total playtime has been reset to 5 hours, and I have so much more than that put into it.
                Yeah, my playtime on Half-Life got reset
    Do you have weird filters on your game library? I know that with some update, steam automatically created a filter for remote play games, so I thought I had lost a bunch of games when they weren't showing up in the main list.
Both portal games are masterpiece works of art.
It’s been 10 years since last of us got released and aged well. So why does it need a remake?
It seemed really short on my second playthrough. I waited about 8 or 9 years but I still remembered too much to make the puzzles challenging again.
I never finished portal 2, but I was v proud of completing the first one. I always thought I was too dumb for puzzle games. Even though defeating Glados took me a few tries, totally worth it to get to the end screen without any outside assistance.
Still gives me nightmares to this day. (VR Version would be amazing)
One game I've replayed time and time again.

First was amazing, but the second was such an experience. Amazing puzzles, characters, AND story, which you'd never really expect after the first game.
I only just played it on my new PC build at the start of lockdown last year. Loads of fun. Even if friends mocked me for waiting so long.
It was really cool back when my then-girlfriend had a laptop that could run the game and I had a PS3 and you got a free PC copy with the PS3 version, we found it pretty easy for us to play together with just that one purchase. Lots of fun.
Yup. I've played through the Cave Johnson stages like 8 times (5 of them in a row within a week) because I just loved that storyline/jokes/Cave himself. Such a good game, with that section being amazing.
HL 3, Portal 3, TF 3 - The Purple Box


Edit: I didn't forget L4D 3. It's basically already happening under a different name. Look up Back 4 Blood trailer. Same developers - Turtle Rock Studios.
    The Orange box 2
        *Break Into Orange Boogaloo*
        The Orange Box, Ep 1
        That's how you get threes from Valve: make them all a two
            This is starting to feel like the math classes I failed
    The dream
    Oh fuck please
        Happy cake day! Here's your free purple box!
            I had no idea it was my cake day. Thanks!!
            The cake is a lie!
    I would dump my life savings into that.
    They should use "Cube" instead of "Box". I know it's synonymous to box but math nerds will love it.
        It's not necessarily synonymous. Boxes can be rectangular solids too. They don't have to have equal sides like cubes do.
            Yeah but, cubed. The three 3 titles, dude was right, math nerds would love it lol, I do.
                Not sure why this is downvoted but people may be missing the logic - 3 by 3 by 3 would be a cube
        It could ship inside of a used condom and I would still tear into it with both hands and a smile.
    I would put L4D 3 here too, but it's basically already being made under the name Back 4 Blood:

https://youtu.be/sG8-0UlzrEA
    Remember back when TF2 was a game you could buy. And no silly hats. Pepperidge Farm remembers
    I'm pre-ordering that... in my dreams
Give Portal Stories: Mel a try. It's a free community-made story mod for Portal 2, has its own Steam page and everything.
    Also Portal Reloaded, it just came out today and it uses time travel as a mechanic. It is also on steam
        Downloading now, it looks interesting. Thanks for the heads up.
            No problem. It is a real mind fuck of a mod
        I'm still waiting for Valve to make their games 64-bit for Catalina.
    Definitely worth playing through. Very well made, good voice acting and story.
        I will also confirm this, as I played through it last year sometime. Definitely very well made and worth playing if you've played 1 and 2 and want more portal.

However, don't expect it to add anything game-changing. It's like an expansion pack on an existing game, more than any sort of subsequent installment. It is a mod, after all.
            It's huge though. I think it does a good job of showing the limits of the Portal concept/engine. By the end of Mel all the Portal'ing is spent in me and I'm ready for a break.   
Then in a year or two I go back and start all over at Portal 1
            Commenting on a portal thread on cake day! Nice! Happy cake day!
                Pretty sure it was yesterday, but I'll take it! Playing Portal 1 right now too.
                    Well depending on how far you've got a long... The cake is a lie.. Or is it.
It will come out, but it will be VR only!  
\[ Evil cackle \]
    To be fair, a Portal VR game would be insane
        Insane yes, but I'm not sure it's be that fun in VR. Doing a ceiling to floor loop into a jump might be a little bit jarring on the brain. Lol
            imagine the people gel that was scraped in Portal 2 made a reappearance in vr
                You mean the gel that supposedly let you walk on walls?
            According to the developers, this is the exact reason why they dropped a VR Portal in favor of Alyx
            Sounds rather nauseating.  Those bits where you bounce up and down she does a little spin.
            As someone who gets serious simulation sickness, I feel nauseated just thinking about it.
        Oh im hoping it will happen for sure.  
There was a lot of angry screaming when Alyx came along though. :')
            it's been 10 years. i wouldn't count on it anymore
            Portal VR! Yay!

(Gets downvoted into oblivion)
    [deleted]
        I get motion sick in VR from just *walking.* I'm sure as hell not about to go jumping through ceilings and shit.
    That would be an insta-buy.
We'll never see a Portal 3 because the main designers of the game no longer work for Valve.  Even if there is a new one, it wouldn't be the same.
    Just because it isn’t entirely the same doesn’t mean they couldn’t improve upon what worked with the other team and make it still a good game
        In theory of course you are completely correct.

In actuality, sequels of legendary games made by new teams almost never go well. Is there an example of it ever going well? I can't think of one.
            New vegas maybe?

            Well Portal 2, for one.
    Are the writers there at least? Because that's where the soul is.
        >>Unfortunately, most of the people who made Portal what it is are no longer at Valve. Kim Swift, who produced Narbacular Drop, the student game that eventually turned into Portal, left Valve in 2009 and now works for Electronic Arts. Writer Erik Wolpaw took off in early 2017 to work on Double Fine's Psychonauts 2, another long-awaited sequel. Chet Faliszek, Wolpaw's co-writer, left a few months later, saying that he needed a change of pace after spending 12 years at the company. Doug Wood, one of Portal 2's designers and animators, retired in 2016. Josh Weier, Portal 2's project lead, departed shortly thereafter.

most notable Portal developers left already
            Wolpaw was contracted to help out with writing Alyx, so temporary returns are possible.
            Kim Swift really downgraded there when it comes to integrity
                I'll bet he's making more money though
    Most of the main designers of Portal 1 didn't work on Portal 2 and that turned out great, so I wouldn't worry too much about that.
    A few of them came back last year for unknown reasons

Don't get your hopes up though. They were great writers. Probably came back to help with HL:A
[deleted]
    Away from home rn but gonna play it when I get back---how was it? I'm interested in difficulty in particular. Did the time portal feel like an added layer of complexity or more a gimmick? No specific spoilers, if you please.
        [deleted]
            Just watched. Awesome. Can't wait to get home.
Portal 2 was originally going to have a different core mechanic, w/o GLaDOS, or Chell (Shell, like a terminal; Is she really GLaDOS's daughter?)... eventually they migrated back to the older puzzle elements.

See here for the full story, and glimpse of now unused "new" shutter mechanic they said they'd save for later... maybe for Portal 3?  [Portal 2: Creating a Sequel to a Game That Doesn't Need One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYFvwbby2YM)
Yeah valve can't count that high, though my heart hurts saying that.
Hell, right now I'd just settle for both of the Portal games on the Switch, that would be amazing.
Or the heat death of the universe
I hate to be the one possibly offering false hope but recently Valve did a collaboration with the Chalkeates YouTube channel on a song specifically about Valve counting to 3. Gabe himself personally offered a bit of voice work for it to boot

Now I still hold my doubts but maybe....... maybe Valve is alluding to them actually going back to old series with that? Maybe?
    I don't understand why they don't outsource them to a developer they trust maybe with some creative input.
        I think they're just not very interested anymore. Clearly certain people and divisions work on new games here and there, but it's been a long, long time since Valve needed to make games to rake in shitloads of money.
            Valve actually wanted to continue making games for a long time, they just had their idea of a flat work structure, where devs could basically choose on whatever project they want to do, which led to devs starting a massive amount of projects, but then never finishing them when they encounter larger problems. They finally fixed it with Alyx since they needed a release to advertise the Valve index.



There is the visual book series of a valve Dec called final hours: "insert game" who in the newest installment, Half-Life: Alyx - Final Hours mentioned (IIRC) three different attempts on making a half life three since portal 2 came out, which all failed to be developed fully.
Valve makes money now, not games.
    I get that, but they should find an actual game developer that they trust and let them make the game. They could even keep some creative input if they wanted. It just seems stupid to have the IPs sit there. Then they can make even more money without even doing much.
I have no mind fucking boggling clue why they haven’t made these games. 

They KNOW we’d all pay our right legs for them. So why not? Isn’t that what we’d call “big brain”? I don’t understand.. like wtf else are they doing even.
You should now feel mentally reinvigorated.  If you suspect staring at art has not provided the required intellectual sustenance, reflect briefly on this classical music.

            I was just going to say that. Since valve made that mod after all, I think its canon enough for me.
    Why did this make me sad
I stand by my statement that those cores are Nolan North’s best work.
    I loved that the Anger Core in the original game was voiced by Mike Patton, the frontman of Faith No More
        You mean frontman of Mr. Bungle, Mondo Cane, Tomahawk, Fantomas, Moonchild, Dead Cross, and Hemophiliac, guest of Secret Chiefs 3, The Young Gods, Zu, and more? THAT Mike Patton? Dude's a slacker.
            I’m a Lovage kinda guy myself
        I liked that core the most
You monster.
I’ve been really busy being dead.
    You know, after you murdered me
        Okay, look, we both said a lot of things that you're going to regret.
        YOU WHAT??
            Okay look, we both said a lot of things that you’re going to regret
Because I'm a potato.
YESSS I'M SO EXCITED TO MELT MY BRAIN WITH TIME TRAVELLING PORTALS.
    Too bad it's just Zelda style "two timelines" time travel. Still, I bet it's filled with clever timey wimey puzzles. Gotta try it out!
        Honestly anything other than "two timelines" would be essentially impossible to make puzzles with without being absurdly, impossibly hard. Plus how'd you do that with portals? They're very binary things save in placement.
            Well maybe you could make a portal that goes one second in the past, allowing you to clone things? Or one second in the future, allowing you to dodge otherwise undodgeable attacks?
                The thinking with time machine Portal 2 mod from forever ago is free on steam and adds this!
                    there's another portal time mod??? ohno
                        It’s been out since 2014, and it’s really challenging, fun, and free! [Here’s the steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286080/Thinking_with_Time_Machine/)
                What I mean to say is the "ideal" test becomes impossible- either the mechanics are so broken the solution is too simple, or the solution is so complex that no one but the creator can ever do it.
Hell yeah baby
That’s awesome! I wish I had a PC
    What a shame, but you don't even need a good pc. So if xou hava school or work laptop you csn plsy wiht it
        You okay man? Maybe being on Reddit isn’t a good idea right now
        Most test subjects do experience some cognitive deterioration after a few months in suspension...
            Haha. I was tired
    Tbh I’m mad that Apple killed 32bit executables, but I’m more mad at Valve for not updating both Portals to run in 64bit. For a developer as big as Valve it would cost nothing, but I’m pretty sure they’re holding off for some power move bullshit with Apple.
Any other Portal content you could recommend?
    "Portal stories : Mel" is another community created mod on steam.
    If you haven't already, the multiplayer collab in P2 is awesome. Takes it to another level. I only recently tried it for the first time now my son is old enough. I love that he gets the humour.
Did you play the first Portal? It's very small compared to Portal 2, but worth playing.
    I did actually! Played them in order, loved it as well of course. Might have a cheeky replay of them soon!
        You should probably wait a little until you don’t remember much of the puzzles anymore
Portal 1 & 2 are some of the few games I consider must plays for anyone getting into videya for sure. Actually had a tear at the end of 2
I was late to play portal 1. Then thought aww what the hell and then it quickly became *Holy crap this is an amazing game*. 

Was anxious when Portal 2 came around excepting it to be an 'okay' sequel.

Then it absolutely blew me away. Those 2 games are a masterpiece.
    It really is, isn't it?  So many companies fail to capture lightning twice, and the sequel is just milquetoast.  Somehow Portal 2 managed to be distinct, and in a way, almost better?  It sounds wrong to say, they're both amazing games, and saying 2 is better in no way detracts from 1.  I suppose the best way I can liken it is that Portal 1 is like getting your most deeply-wanted gift for your birthday.  Portal 2 is also like that, but all of your favorite people are there to celebrate it with you, and you're going out to your favorite entertainment afterwords.
> Wish I could forget it and play again.

This right here is the hallmark of a good game.
Very kind of you to spoiler tag the end of a 10 year old game. Not everyone has played a game that old and the ending is worth experiencing fresh.
    Shit it's just been so long that I didn't remember it very well at all. A replay is in needed quite badly.
        If you don't own it anymore it's very cheap. It's excellent even after this much time. My only caveat to it was that it didn't look as good as I remembered since I was playing on an HD monitor- I saw more hard polygon edges than I recalled, I saw some of the tricks they use to keep memory use down and make the lighting better than the engine can handle. 

I'd actually be curious what the game would look like if they did a remake with modern graphics- I wonder if there's a mod for that?
            Oh I definitely still own it. Just haven't played much of my 360 games ever since the XBone came out and then life started punching me in the face.

And yeah I just played through Halo 3 and felt the same way. Lots of edges everywhere that I don't remember.
        They could make a pile on a minimal-effort re-release. I’d love to be able to play it on a current gen console.
    Yup never played either Portal games, nor have I watched any playthroughs or watching or read anything about it. Maybe I should do a stream of it to record my virgin reactions.
Fun Fact for those who didn't know: The Companion Cube you receive at the end of Portal 2 is the same one you incinerated in Portal 1 ~~you monster~~

1. It has burn marks on

2. Portal 1 and 2 have very different cube designs. It's not obvious at first, but if you compare them side-by-side, they're *very* different. The Companion Cube at the end of Portal 2 is the only cube in the whole game that uses the Portal 1 model
perfect game
And then you see the moon
    [deleted]
        The moonshot was just a brilliant scene. The focus shifting to it, the delay (I read it's the real speed of light to the moon delay), then just all hell breaks loose. Space core flying by. Definitely in my top 5 game moments in anything.
        Haha, I thought exactly the same! I remember thinking "Shit, no surfaces to portal on... but wait... is that the moon?! Would that work? It would be genius if it did..."
Happy cake day!

...wait a minute...
Based off of this ending, I always assumed portal 3 would be Glados' revenge on you for killing her in the first game. A long waited, calculated revenge she had to postpone in the second game to use you in the retaking of her facility. Well, for that, and to give you false hopes, of course. It would fit her personality too.
    I couldn't even imagine that the plot might be myself. So many possibilities, so little ability to count to 3...
Funny enough, happy cake day
    Thank you! I promise I hadn't planned this all out from the offset.
GLaDOS completely breaking character to cheer him on was great
    I was so surprised to hear JK Simmons as voice of Cave Johnson, I really loved his work, also Stephen Merchant's work. 

And I loved the character of GlaDOS, loved her passive aggressiveness, how she keeps reminding Chell that she killed her mercilessly, her slow claps. 10/10 character writing.
        One of my favorite parts of the game is when you’re finally entering >!Wheatley’s Lair, and GLaDOS gives you the pep talk about revenge, and you realize that you’ve been completely forgiven for the events of the first game because otherwise you’d both get annihilated!<
    That’s what really makes the scene for me. The way she gets fired up while trapped in a potato perched on your portal gun.
        #Take the lemons! Burn his house down!
            It’s also not a bad “show don’t tell” type of scene. She starts reacting to a voice from her past and suddenly, she’s infantalized. She’s vulnerable. This ruthless AI wuvs her papa. It’s a great story-telling moment where she’s more human than AI. It makes the player empathize/sympathize with a computer.
tl;dr Cave Johnson is Megaman
If you didn't do it already watch Aperture Investment Opportunities on yt
    yea I already did ;) They are great
     "Plus, we fire the whole bullet. Thats 65% more bullet per bullet."
    They shoot the whole bullet. They don’t waste any part of it
Now do multiplayer in portal. Just absurd fun.
    already started ;) It really is. My friends are just not very online so it will take a while..
The ending, though. It's just perfect. Think about how rare perfect endings to any story are. I don't want that spoiled — I'm satisfied and want to stay that way.
    So they can bring it back with the AI robots.  Plenty of good ways to continue it without ruining the original story.
    I want Chell to meet up with Gordon Freeman.  


That drydock in "Olde Aperture" .... Blew. My. Mind.
Me too, kid. 

If you want some amazing Portal content; Portal Stories: Mel, Portal Facility (I think that's the name, never played it but heard very good things), And Portal Reloaded (which came out today, good luck- you have to think 4 dimensionally) are all excellent ways to see more Portal content that are complete games. The puzzles are more difficult in the unofficial mod games not because they're harder but because they're more obtuse and kind of poorly communicated sometimes. While playing Mel I found myself struggling through puzzles because the intercom guy (his name is Virgil, the voice acting is pretty solid, they don't try to imitate any characters from the previous games which is good) told me to hurry and the alarm blared every 2 minutes and the whole building shook periodically *while I was trying to solve the puzzle*. That's honestly my only gripe. I'm installing Reloaded tonight and I'm excited to melt my brain with 4 dimensional pickles.

Edit: my first line isn't trying to be condescending I'm referencing the Incredibles.
All of us who've ever played Portal 2 read your comment with envy.
[deleted]
    Truly
I remember getting the game for Christmas on PC in its release year.
It's always such a pleasure
    Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
        Oh how we laughed and laughed
            Except I wasn’t laughing
                Under the circumstances I’ve been shockingly nice
If that is making you feel old, just imagine what it'll be like when someone calls a good game that came out when you were in your early 30s their childhood game...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZOtBNL0z2I

I think the final speedrunners got the last level down to like 35 seconds or something like that. If memory serves, they had a way to break through the ceiling and "fly" (noclip) up to the final battle, bypassing the turret room.
    That was impressive af (even tho any% is crazy and cool as shit I still like glitchless runs the best)
        [deleted]
            4 hours later and I got to hear that sweet ending song, I forgot how good portal 2 was
"NOOOOOO!!!"
Lies. I ate the cake. It was delicious and moist.
They retconned cake back in, a robot hand snuffs out the candle.
Much like those the Beatles, fans have an interesting way of ruining great things
I like not shooting initially. Wheatley says something like:

'That's it, take one last look at your precious moon'
Doesn’t the screen point you straight at the moon? It’s been a while since I played, but I remember it being very obvious what to do.
    To be fair I was in my teens and have had other games hit me in other ways like Nier:Automata
In a way I understand why it won't. They made the tools for people to mod whole games into being and make/share levels- it's the same reason why after Mario Maker 2 I suspect Nintendo will never make another 2d Mario game. They've shown us everything they can think to in level designs within the constraints of the game's premise and, in a way, taught us everything they know about that particular genre. Giving us the creation tools is them saying, "that's all we know, now you get to show others what you can do." In the Valve case, they've also told the stories they want to tell and left the rest of the lore open to speculation, invention, and our imaginations.
    Yeah, that makes total sense. I still wish it could come out tho lol
        Will not happen ever. I would eat a raw uncooked boot before it ever did and you can hold me to that
Huh? Is this a HL/Portal timeline thing?
    Yup. I got it mixed up a bit though. This year will be 50 years since it was sealed

https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Test_Shaft_09
>3rd portal that allows you to travel to the future and to the present

Wait that's illegal
I'm extraordinary confident if you looked around a VR mod has already been made. 

Although you might vom as you fly through the air.
    lol yea I figured it more as a joke. But it would be fun if motion sick wasn't an issue. 

https://store.steampowered.com/app/446750/Portal_Stories_VR/

from 2016, dang
        That’s not really portal though is it? Aside from using the same graphical assets, it’s has barely anything in common as the gameplay changes a lot. I’m not sure an actual portal game would work in VR.
            What do you mean? It is a community made mod, so its not like its from valve but its a mod of portal. And yea I have now idea how it is, I just thought I would post as he mentioned a mod was already made.
                I know it’s just a mod, I’m saying the gameplay has nothing to do with portal. Aside from using the same assets to make it look visually the same, it has nothing to do with Portal.

In other words, if this game had different art and was released standalone, I would never think “damn this reminds me so much of portal!”
                    Oh dam so there's no portals in it?
                        Yep, for some reason someone thought that was a good idea
                            Well thanks for clearing that up. Take it off my game list for when I finally get VR
                                No problem! 

No need to take it off though, it’s still entertaining for a while and since it’s super small (less than 30 minutes I think?) and free, you don’t lose anything trying it :) it’s just a bit frustrating to play because you’ll be thinking “damn, they had such a good opportunity to make portal in vr why did they do it this way?”
Oooo have you played it yet? I've been dying to I'm installing it after work. How is it?
    Bit trippy til you get used to it 😅, In my head I was thinking the opposite in terms of the 4d but really neat concept. Small thing was the aspect ratio thing was messed up for me and couldn't get it to fully fit my screen properly 🤷‍♂️
    My brain melted from the puzzles
Portal Reloaded is free on steam from what I hear.

Never played the game, but always wanted to. Now that I'm out of the sunken place, I'll have to put it on the list!!
    You need the base game tho
You’re forgetting that January 2020 was like 10 years ago
It’s not on game pass but have you tried The Witness? I enjoyed that a lot. It’s a fun and sometimes tough puzzle game. It’s been a while since I had to break out a pencil and paper for a video game. 

How did call of the sea turn out? I lost interest and gave up after I encountered some bug/glitch early on. I couldn’t advance through a puzzle and had to YouTube a walkthrough. If I didn’t do that I would still be stuck in the game.
    I really enjoyed it but I also didn’t experience any bugs. The story was just intriguing enough to keep me interested and I liked the puzzle design. I played through the whole thing in a weekend
    I'll second The Witness. Literally broke my brain for a few weeks after I got to a certain point.
If you have literally any PC made in the last 5 years it 100% can run Portal 2 and all of the mods people have made. Many of those mods are full on games in themselves and they definitley bring the same spark back that the originals did.
    lol nope all I’ve got is a 2013 MacBook and the new Xbox. Looking to build one soon whenever graphics cards are reasonably obtainable
Absolutely would recommend checking out The Talos Principle if you haven't already.
I doubt it would make a difference. The GTX 780 could probably max it out no prob.
They haven't make their own game in years save Alyx- if they don't announce anything today about anything Portal related, I am confident that they will never make another portal game ever again. I think a lot of the reason their games are so incredibly popular is because 1) they make great games with solid mechanics and 2) they show tiny glimpses into these intricate, aesthetically intriguing worlds but hold most of the cards close to their chest. Hell, to this *day* we know virtually n o t h i n g about G-man.

That being said I think keeping all the cards close they can provide people modding tools (Gary's mod) and stage builders (Portal 2's community level system) and people can use those to create new stories inside the world they established. I am actually super surprised after they released the plot for Half Life 3 (remember when that happened? It was *crazy*!) that no one ever made the game using Gary's mod (or at least I never heard about it). 

The unfortunate trade off with this, however, is that if they ever showed their full hand for the way the world works, they'd eternally ruin the infinite possibilities fan games/mods allow. And making a proper HL3 or Portal 3 would do exactly that. 

So while I will gradually move further away from  experiencing a Portal game for the first time indefinitely, I am grateful for the community these games have fostered and the memories we can all share.
Absolutely, it's one of the best games of all time.
Absolutely

Why make games when others will pay you to host theirs?
When someone in valve learns to count to 3...
It’s worth it. Do it.
I don't think valve would do it but who knows, they did allow the black mesa remake to be made
    Yeah, I'm not holding my breath. If they'd just allow the game to be streamed, I'd be happy.

Note: it might already be allowed but not on the PSN.
Just buy it on Steam. Its $10 and practically any PC can run it now.
    You think so? I just built my computer a month ago but I can't get my hands on a GPU (fucking miners).
        A modern iGPU can run it pretty well. Even the iGPU of the i5 6600t can run it at reduced resolution. My laptop with Iris XE iGPU can run it maxed out at 1080p.
Some fun bit of trivia, ‘when life gives you lemons’ isn’t a common saying in France, so French Cave Johnson goes on a completely separate and hilarious tirade about how when life is a Big Bad Wolf trying to blow your house down you should cut the wolf’s legs off.
    Je vais ordonner à mes ingénieurs de monter des rotules sur ta maison pour pouvoir les lui péter !
        This is exceptionally pleasing to me. I now wish to replay this masterpiece en francais.

I've always loved GLaDOS's little weak supporting cheers that play in the background when the player listens to cave's rants lol.

        I love Cara Mia Addio so much. Ellen McClain improvised a lot of the Italian on the spot.
            It was so good! I play through the game every once in a while just to hear "The Turret Concierto!"
        Should've been the actual ending credits song, imo.
            Idk want you gone still gives me chills every time I hear it
                Yes. Want you gone and Still alive are so brilliant
                Unpopular opinion, i know.  But "Want You Gone" doesnt hit the same as "Still Alive."
I’m like 90% sure the quote is “You **dangerous**, Mute, Lunatic.”

But I could just be misremembering
    The right woman in the wrong place, can make all the difference in the world.
That’s the whole meaning, there’s also the sub context of her being Caroline, and possibly chells mother.
    Zoinks, Chell's mom?
        There’s a whole thing on glades and thus Caroline and cave Jonson actually being chells mom it’s never been proven tho and even Glados’s actress dosnt know.

(EDIT) Im updating this since I honestly didn’t expect this to gain so much attention. 

The whole chells mom thing is a popular theory that hasn’t been proven, the only hints are cara Mia (turret opera) and Easter eggs. Glados’s voice actor has stated tho that cara Mia was her own idea it was also done from her memory Latin as a kid hence why the translation is bad as it’s mostly not recognizable. 

Look into it if your curious it’s a fun ride.
            I believe the developers said that Glados wasn't part of the original project, but that the test players felt the game needed an antagonist, so they added it
                This was also extremely early on in development
                    Glados made the game.
                        Agreed
                        It really did. Even if they just had an announcer (and even a good one like Cave Johnson) the game would have lacked the soul it has now.
                            Go  play the  addon mel  on steam  cave jonhson talk most of the time
                        Actually, Valve did.
                            Did you know the cake is a lie?
                        Absolutely. Some dialogue interactions had me dieing laughing. Also I guess we can't really call it interactions because we never do respond to Glados, ever. So she is really talking to herself. Such a great game.
                    The game ended up VERY different from how it started out :-) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narbacular_Drop

There’s actually a playable version of the original somewhere in the intertubes.
                        The same school had another student game called "Tag:The Power of Paint" iirc. In it you had a gun that painted surfaces with different colors, which would change how that surface reacted to the player.

One color would make you run fast, anther would make you bounce off the surface, and a third would make you stick to it and rotate your perspective.

Valve hired that group of students and put the concept into Portal 2.
                            Ah!  Cool to know. Digipen seems to have had some pretty good students.
                        I remember playing this! I always said portal was a copy. I never remembered the name, and people doubted it's existence, but here it is!
                        Was free way back. I played it at some point or another.
                the test players felt the game needed ~~an antagonist~~ a beacon of light
            >cave Jonson actually being chells mom

CAVE JOHNSON IS HER MOM?
                My engineers tried telling me drinking moon rock gel would make me infertile.  To hell with them I say! Just to prove them wrong, I'll have my own damn kid,  and when I do it,  I'm going to be both the father and the mother! Let's get to some science.
                    It's been 10 years, but I can still hear that man's voice in my head.
                        I'm willing to bet it's been less than 10 years since you've heard JK Simmons' voice, though.
                            The man is a freaking treasure. He seems to just really embrace the crazy in every part he plays.
                        Me too, just now it has to do with insurance
                        This is true! 😂
                        Do you know who I am?

I'm the man whos gonna burn your house down!

With the lemons!
                    Why does this make me feel it's more likely as opposed to less likely?
                Hey gang! Cave Johnson here! 

I'm just popping in to clear up some confusion. There have been some rumors that I have been engaging in relationships with Aperture employees that would be considered inappropriate for the workplace. Let me assure you, these rumors are absolutely false. There have also been rumors that I may or may not have sired certain children with certain people who may or may not have been my personal assistant, who I may or may not have arranged to be digitally copied to develop an AI to run the company once I finally succumb to this terrible illness that may or may not have been caused by powered moon rocks that I may or may not have also tried snorting one time in the 80's while trying to find new marketable applications for existing products. Let me assure you, that these rumors are absolutely true - but only under well defined probabilistic scenarios.

Let me explain. See, a few years back the boys in engineering started having trouble coming up with new ideas for products. We tried everything! We tried a portal gun with one entrance and two exits. We tried a new gel that makes literally anything it touches spontaneously combust. We even had a period where we considered getting back to our roots, so to speak, and making shower curtains again! Eventually we settled on the last idea we'd ever need, the Aperture Science Perpetual Testing Initiative. Now that we have access to the multiverse, we no longer need to come up with ideas, we can just steal them from some other version of ourselves! So what does this have to do with the rumors from earlier? Well, there are infinite multiverses, each with differences that could be minor, such as one guy having a minor corporate policy violation that's being blown way out of proportion by HR, or they could be significant changes affecting the entire human race. Case in point, the Cave Johnson addressing you right now is actually not human at all, but from a multiverse where everyone is actually a ferret. So you see, given the infinite variables between infinite multiverses, there is almost certainly one where the events being described have come to pass. But it's not this one! Nope! No sir! I give you my word. And it's like my father always told me, "Cave, a ferret that can't give you their word isn't a ferret, but a weasel." 

Anyway, I think that should clear up all of the confusion, so I won't bother talking about how you can contact me if you have anymore questions, since obviously there won't be any. 

Thanks,
-- Cave
                    You are a delight

            Really? I just played through it again recently and I thought they were pretty clear about glados being her mother.
            Wasn't Glados played by multiple actors?
                No, GLaDOS was voiced by a single person, Ellen McLain.
                    I thought the singer from Faith No More voiced one of her personalities in Portal 2
                        Nah, this is his starring role in the game 

https://youtu.be/HOhLgfQqg_g
                Damn just downvote this guy for being curious lol
                    I found that a bit interesting.
                    Proper reddit etiquette is to answer with words instead of downvotes!
        There's a part in the game where you come across science projects created by the kids of the workers, and one of them is signed by "Chell".

Could be just a random easter egg, but it's likely that she's at least the daughter of *someone* who worked there.
            True, but it's also canon that she's adopted. Cave Johnson and Caroline could well be her biological parents though.
                GLaDOS *says* she's adopted, but GLaDOS talks mad shit.
                    Yes, but the context, both GLaDOS and Wheatley say she's adopted. GLaDOS could simply have denied it, but she didn't, in fact she confirmed it, and *sympathized* with Chell about it.
                Is it? I don't really fully trust whatever GLaDOS says.
                    Both Wheatley and GLaDOS state it as fact, and at that point GLaDOS is on Chell's side.
                        Oh, I didn't remember that.

Still, they didn't say *when* she was adopted, did they? She can be a worker's adopted daughter, no?
    Very likely Chell's mother. Per the Ratman comics, Doug took her as his own to hide the fact that the boss and his assistant were having an affair.
        Portal 2 is one of my all time favorite games, but I have no idea what you just said.
            Doug Rattmann is the guy that wrote all the cake is a lie graffiti in the games. An old aperture science employee that survived glados killing everyone and went crazy living in the walls of the facility. 

They put out some comics called Ratman about Rattmann. I havent read them, so I can't tell you what happens in them. But seems like this person is saying Rattmann was chell's adopted parent? Raising her instead of Cave and Caroline? This is the first i'm hearing about it too. Not crazy about the idea.
                He was schizophrenic and ran out of meds.
            There's a comic book (I believe it's just called "Ratman"), where in we see Doug Ratman, the man who left all of the messages behind the walls in both games (as he slowly went insane). In the comic, it's revealed that his daughter was taken at take your daughter to work day (the day Glados was turned on) into the test subject pool. I haven't read it myself but it's apparent in the comic that 1) his daughter isn't biologically his 2) he "adopted" her from a coworker 3) he's resentful toward Cave & Caroline through his career. Putting that together, it's pretty strongly implied that Chell is the abandoned daughter of Caroline and Cave who was raised by Ratman (also why Glados relentlessly calls you adopted).
                Ohhh GladOS is that cold.
                That's pretty far off into crazy fan-theory land, though, and I think you're just misremembering; the take you daughter to work day isn't in the comic at all, and the same comic has him bumping Chell up to #1 on the list of test subjects for Portal 1 because the reason she was originally rejected from testing altogether was that her "tenacity" score was off the charts. Nothing in the text states or implies he knows her at all, much less that she's his adopted kid- the companion cube asks how he knew about her and says "know what?" and it was "something in her file". He's not trying to save her at that point (he is trying to save her after she's recaptured at the end of Portal 1), he's just picking someone out of the files that can fight back.
                    thank you for the clarification, I must be misremembering.
        GLaDOS is likely Chell's mom. Chell's Potato Battery science fair display is visible from the Bring Your Daughter To Work Day, so she was certainly the daughter of an employee.
    But Caroline is American and Cave Johnson is American, so it doesn't make sense because Chell is asian
        Caroline's last name can't be Li? Have you never met an Asian person who "sounded American"?
            Here's an [in-game portrait](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/half-life/images/0/07/Cave_caroline_70s.png/revision/latest?cb=20120621160408&path-prefix=en) of the two of them. I wouldn't say she looks particularly asian.
                Clearly this image is quite off. Doesn't look anything like the teacher from Whiplash.
                    But it kinda resembles that guy from that prison documentary
            I am Asian
                I am Groot
        When is this ever stated lol. If anything Chell looks a little like Caroline when you think about it.
            "Chell is modeled after actress Alésia Glidewell, and appears to be of mixed-race white European and East or Southeast Asian background, with dark hair and blue eyes."

                Wow that's interesting! Thanks.
                    I went to college with her.
                        Nice.
                    No problem
You and me both I love the mother theory but it’s shaky as there are some holes like their appearances that don’t work well.

    Where do you find this gloriously obnoxious tune??!!
"You crazy, mute, lunatic."
    Stephen Merchant should have been cast as Vision in the MCU.
        He was very good in Logan (2017) as Caliban
To be fair, you only see Chell slightly more often than you hear her.
    If that is how you play you mean. You can see her everytime you open a portal!
        Not every time. You only see yourself if the other portal faces your current position.
            \*sigh\* You are technically correct. The best kind of correct.
I wouldn’t say Chell is memorable, unless of course you’re talking about the companion cube
    Wait, Chell is the companion cube? How? Time travel? Cloning?
When I played both games back to back, I noticed that the puzzles in the first game are notably more challenging. With Portal 2 I found there was a lot more hints to the solutions.
    Portal 2 had more challenging puzzles but design that led you to grow into the puzzles very smoothly. There were still plenty of moments of having to work things out (at least for me).

But portal 2 also contains probably the greatest “puzzle” design of all time. They seed the moon rock = portal carrier stuff into the game just enough to lodge it in your head without making it feel like a Chekhov’s Gun. So when you’re in your death throes and the the ceiling opens to show the moon, the solution is instantly obvious and yet allows the player to feel smart in that moment. And the satisfaction from seeing your portal glint off the moon (I think they showed that portals propagate at c) was immense.
        Funny story: they calculated how long it should take to see the glint (because of the speed of light) but they couldn't use it because it was too slow and a lot of players looked away before they saw it.
            2.6 seconds is an eternity for a gamer
                More like 5 seconds for the round trip, assuming the gun works at the speed of light.
                    But it only takes 1.3 to get to the moon and 1.3 for the light to come back.
                        Huh, you're right. I've been off by a factor of 2 for years.
                Fuck I just laughed out loud on a bus with only one other person and they are looking at me like I am strange.
            There's a sign in 2 that says something like: In case of reactor implosion, look directly at implosion. 

AFAIK they put that sign in because they worked hard on the animation of the implosion and play testers never saw it because they turned around to keep playing. Should've put up a sign like that on the moon.
            I've heard somewhere they also programmed it so that no matter what button you choose (orange or blue portal), it will be the correct portal on the moon matching the one that's already on the ground. Because people couldn't think which was the right color in the moment. I know I definitely didn't remember which one I should be pressing lol.
                I remember hearing, probably in the commentary, that there are a few places that automatically switch the color of the last portal so that no matter which one you fire it's the right one. I think it's when you're in a funnel being projected into a portal.

And several of the long flings, if your speed is within a range it will adjust it to be exactly the right speed to make the landing.
        I still remember how I felt when I saw the moon. Just sheer excitement about what was about to happen when I fired that portal.
            Truly one of the greatest moments in gaming. That shift from "oh wow, the moon" to "wait, what if--" to "HOLY SHIT THIS IS GODDAMNED EPIC" ... perfection.
                Yeah, that's one of my all-time gaming HOLY SHIT moments.  Really great.
            I wanted to say PORTALS ON THE MOON on my fb feed but I didn't wanna be a spoiler.
        This was a really well written analysis of why the moon reveal is so poignant and why I have never met anyone that didn’t get the reveal.
    I kinda agree, i think portal 1 was really a puzzle game with a really original story, while portal 2 was more a linear story game with puzzles.

For me the 2 was harder, i struggled a lot, especially with the "old" aperture with the gels and all
        Yeah, I see a lot of people say that the first was more challenging. But I breezed through most of those puzzles. The second was much harder for me when you get to the old section.
            Portal was a freebie with the Half-Life 2 set that had all the HL2 games. I remember finishing the last of HL2 well after midnight and thinking "well let's see what Portal is" and it was just the nicest dessert after the long slog that is HL2. No headcrabs, no moaning zombie corpses that throw headcrabs at you, just some puzzles and that lovely wit.

*Are you still there?*
                By dessert, you mean cake right?
            That's mostly because when you played the first game, you weren't used to thinking with portals yet. By the sequel, you've had some experience and have already familiarized yourself with the concept.

Still found 2 harder though.
        There was gel puzzle or two that I still don't know if I did it right or if I just did it in a way that worked.
    Most of the more difficult puzzles in Portal 2 are in the co-op mode.
    weirdly enough, Portal 1 was more challenging, but it was a whole lot more intuitive for first-time players (maybe because its graphics were so basic?)

I'm saying this because I've seen people learning to 'think with portals' on both games, and the experience is different. On Portal 1, I had no need to explain what is happening, people always figure out what the portal gun does, and it was always fun to watch the brainfuck

On Portal 2, god, I've seen friends spend nearly an hour and not understanding what the portals do, until I had to explain it
    Check out portal stories: Mel for that good challenge
    I feel like Portal 1 had more reactionary puzzles which can be more difficult for some.  What I mean by that is more puzzles where you have to shoot another portal in mid air, usually with a relatively small target too.  I don't think portal 2 had as many as those...
    Yes, exactly!  Portal 2 was too damn easy throughout.  "Oh, it must be the only clean spot that I can shoot a portal on!"
        It's the tragedy of modern puzzle games where markers point out the answer. In the old Tomb Raider games you could spend ages on a tomb. Now it's a matter of looking for the white paint on the ledge and the glowing cliff face for you to climb. I think excesive play testing has killed challenging games.
    I agree sadly, since Portal 2 had a lot more mechanics, but I seemed to rely less on stretching possibilities because of this. The custom maps are damn hard, though.
I like 1 a little more, personally. Aesthetically I don’t like how most of 2 is spent outside of functional testing chambers
    I actually love how the world was expanded upon in a way consistent with 1. Old Aperture is amazing, its whole feel is simultaneously nostalgic and foreboding and as you explore the story, it becomes moving. Then you return to the new laboratories and your relationship with GLaDOS has been changed radically.

None of the new characters introduced felt superfluous or like they ruin the vibe of 1, which to me is *incredible*. Overall tremendous writing in both games. 1 was lovely, but what 2 did with that story was just a masterpiece. It's been years and I'm still in love with the entire thing.
        I absolutely love the design of Old Aperture. All of the button illumination, checkboxes, and counters were Nixie tubes. And the test spheres have such a neat design to them.
        What I don’t like about 2 is how self aware it feels. Like a lot of the old aperture puzzles feel like you just need to search the huge room for 10 minutes to find the one white spot to put the portal on and solve the puzzle, but it’s framed as you’re outside the testing chambers in the open so there should be more possibilities? Something about it doesn’t feel right to me. Also personally Wheatley got really old.
            Agreed - I loved the game and overall it was only a minor gripe for me, but the fact that it wasn't more "sandboxy" did take me out of the game a little bit.
            Well the portals only work on surfaces covered with moon dust iirc
                Yeah but it didn’t feel like you were exploring the world when there was always exactly one white panel exactly where you needed it. It makes the puzzles less satisfying, as opposed to 1 where for most puzzles you could put them almost anywhere but it wouldn’t accomplish anything if you didn’t have a plan
                    You are making some very solid points that I didn't even notice. Loved the game but yeah you are right.
        I completed the game in a single sitting. By the time I got to the old chambers I was getting real tired and taking so long to figure out the puzzles cause of it. But that only helped to make the atmosphere even mor emoody for me. So many good memories of this one.
    I totally get that. But the story also needed it to be the way it was.
Did you out it as hidden maybe?
And if you go to the store page for portal, can you actually buy it? If so then it's indeed gone but maybe you can download fron there... Idunno
    First thing I did is went to the store and it makes me have to pay for it. I'm playing Half-Life right now, and its the same copy I had when I was a kid. So it's very weird.
        I just checked mine. Although I still have it the total playtime has been reset to 5 hours, and I have so much more than that put into it.
            Yeah, my playtime on Half-Life got reset
Do you have weird filters on your game library? I know that with some update, steam automatically created a filter for remote play games, so I thought I had lost a bunch of games when they weren't showing up in the main list.
The Orange box 2

        I had no idea it was my cake day. Thanks!!
        The cake is a lie!
I would dump my life savings into that.
They should use "Cube" instead of "Box". I know it's synonymous to box but math nerds will love it.
    It's not necessarily synonymous. Boxes can be rectangular solids too. They don't have to have equal sides like cubes do.
        Yeah but, cubed. The three 3 titles, dude was right, math nerds would love it lol, I do.
            Not sure why this is downvoted but people may be missing the logic - 3 by 3 by 3 would be a cube
    It could ship inside of a used condom and I would still tear into it with both hands and a smile.
I would put L4D 3 here too, but it's basically already being made under the name Back 4 Blood:

Remember back when TF2 was a game you could buy. And no silly hats. Pepperidge Farm remembers
I'm pre-ordering that... in my dreams
Also Portal Reloaded, it just came out today and it uses time travel as a mechanic. It is also on steam
    Downloading now, it looks interesting. Thanks for the heads up.
        No problem. It is a real mind fuck of a mod
    I'm still waiting for Valve to make their games 64-bit for Catalina.
Definitely worth playing through. Very well made, good voice acting and story.
    I will also confirm this, as I played through it last year sometime. Definitely very well made and worth playing if you've played 1 and 2 and want more portal.

However, don't expect it to add anything game-changing. It's like an expansion pack on an existing game, more than any sort of subsequent installment. It is a mod, after all.
        It's huge though. I think it does a good job of showing the limits of the Portal concept/engine. By the end of Mel all the Portal'ing is spent in me and I'm ready for a break.   
Then in a year or two I go back and start all over at Portal 1
        Commenting on a portal thread on cake day! Nice! Happy cake day!
            Pretty sure it was yesterday, but I'll take it! Playing Portal 1 right now too.
                Well depending on how far you've got a long... The cake is a lie.. Or is it.
To be fair, a Portal VR game would be insane
    Insane yes, but I'm not sure it's be that fun in VR. Doing a ceiling to floor loop into a jump might be a little bit jarring on the brain. Lol
        imagine the people gel that was scraped in Portal 2 made a reappearance in vr
            You mean the gel that supposedly let you walk on walls?
        According to the developers, this is the exact reason why they dropped a VR Portal in favor of Alyx
        Sounds rather nauseating.  Those bits where you bounce up and down she does a little spin.
        As someone who gets serious simulation sickness, I feel nauseated just thinking about it.
    Oh im hoping it will happen for sure.  
There was a lot of angry screaming when Alyx came along though. :')
        it's been 10 years. i wouldn't count on it anymore
        Portal VR! Yay!

(Gets downvoted into oblivion)
[deleted]
    I get motion sick in VR from just *walking.* I'm sure as hell not about to go jumping through ceilings and shit.
That would be an insta-buy.
Just because it isn’t entirely the same doesn’t mean they couldn’t improve upon what worked with the other team and make it still a good game
    In theory of course you are completely correct.

In actuality, sequels of legendary games made by new teams almost never go well. Is there an example of it ever going well? I can't think of one.
        New vegas maybe?

Are the writers there at least? Because that's where the soul is.
    >>Unfortunately, most of the people who made Portal what it is are no longer at Valve. Kim Swift, who produced Narbacular Drop, the student game that eventually turned into Portal, left Valve in 2009 and now works for Electronic Arts. Writer Erik Wolpaw took off in early 2017 to work on Double Fine's Psychonauts 2, another long-awaited sequel. Chet Faliszek, Wolpaw's co-writer, left a few months later, saying that he needed a change of pace after spending 12 years at the company. Doug Wood, one of Portal 2's designers and animators, retired in 2016. Josh Weier, Portal 2's project lead, departed shortly thereafter.

most notable Portal developers left already
        Wolpaw was contracted to help out with writing Alyx, so temporary returns are possible.
        Kim Swift really downgraded there when it comes to integrity
            I'll bet he's making more money though
Most of the main designers of Portal 1 didn't work on Portal 2 and that turned out great, so I wouldn't worry too much about that.
A few of them came back last year for unknown reasons

Don't get your hopes up though. They were great writers. Probably came back to help with HL:A
Away from home rn but gonna play it when I get back---how was it? I'm interested in difficulty in particular. Did the time portal feel like an added layer of complexity or more a gimmick? No specific spoilers, if you please.
    [deleted]
        Just watched. Awesome. Can't wait to get home.
I don't understand why they don't outsource them to a developer they trust maybe with some creative input.
    I think they're just not very interested anymore. Clearly certain people and divisions work on new games here and there, but it's been a long, long time since Valve needed to make games to rake in shitloads of money.
        Valve actually wanted to continue making games for a long time, they just had their idea of a flat work structure, where devs could basically choose on whatever project they want to do, which led to devs starting a massive amount of projects, but then never finishing them when they encounter larger problems. They finally fixed it with Alyx since they needed a release to advertise the Valve index.



There is the visual book series of a valve Dec called final hours: "insert game" who in the newest installment, Half-Life: Alyx - Final Hours mentioned (IIRC) three different attempts on making a half life three since portal 2 came out, which all failed to be developed fully.
I get that, but they should find an actual game developer that they trust and let them make the game. They could even keep some creative input if they wanted. It just seems stupid to have the IPs sit there. Then they can make even more money without even doing much.
I feel like I should link some deep harpsichord music. For science.

    You mean frontman of Mr. Bungle, Mondo Cane, Tomahawk, Fantomas, Moonchild, Dead Cross, and Hemophiliac, guest of Secret Chiefs 3, The Young Gods, Zu, and more? THAT Mike Patton? Dude's a slacker.
        I’m a Lovage kinda guy myself
    I liked that core the most
You know, after you murdered me
    Okay, look, we both said a lot of things that you're going to regret.
    YOU WHAT??
        Okay look, we both said a lot of things that you’re going to regret
Too bad it's just Zelda style "two timelines" time travel. Still, I bet it's filled with clever timey wimey puzzles. Gotta try it out!
    Honestly anything other than "two timelines" would be essentially impossible to make puzzles with without being absurdly, impossibly hard. Plus how'd you do that with portals? They're very binary things save in placement.
        Well maybe you could make a portal that goes one second in the past, allowing you to clone things? Or one second in the future, allowing you to dodge otherwise undodgeable attacks?
            The thinking with time machine Portal 2 mod from forever ago is free on steam and adds this!
                there's another portal time mod??? ohno
                    It’s been out since 2014, and it’s really challenging, fun, and free! [Here’s the steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286080/Thinking_with_Time_Machine/)
            What I mean to say is the "ideal" test becomes impossible- either the mechanics are so broken the solution is too simple, or the solution is so complex that no one but the creator can ever do it.
What a shame, but you don't even need a good pc. So if xou hava school or work laptop you csn plsy wiht it
    You okay man? Maybe being on Reddit isn’t a good idea right now
    Most test subjects do experience some cognitive deterioration after a few months in suspension...
        Haha. I was tired
Tbh I’m mad that Apple killed 32bit executables, but I’m more mad at Valve for not updating both Portals to run in 64bit. For a developer as big as Valve it would cost nothing, but I’m pretty sure they’re holding off for some power move bullshit with Apple.
"Portal stories : Mel" is another community created mod on steam.
If you haven't already, the multiplayer collab in P2 is awesome. Takes it to another level. I only recently tried it for the first time now my son is old enough. I love that he gets the humour.
I did actually! Played them in order, loved it as well of course. Might have a cheeky replay of them soon!
    You should probably wait a little until you don’t remember much of the puzzles anymore
It really is, isn't it?  So many companies fail to capture lightning twice, and the sequel is just milquetoast.  Somehow Portal 2 managed to be distinct, and in a way, almost better?  It sounds wrong to say, they're both amazing games, and saying 2 is better in no way detracts from 1.  I suppose the best way I can liken it is that Portal 1 is like getting your most deeply-wanted gift for your birthday.  Portal 2 is also like that, but all of your favorite people are there to celebrate it with you, and you're going out to your favorite entertainment afterwords.
Shit it's just been so long that I didn't remember it very well at all. A replay is in needed quite badly.
    If you don't own it anymore it's very cheap. It's excellent even after this much time. My only caveat to it was that it didn't look as good as I remembered since I was playing on an HD monitor- I saw more hard polygon edges than I recalled, I saw some of the tricks they use to keep memory use down and make the lighting better than the engine can handle. 

I'd actually be curious what the game would look like if they did a remake with modern graphics- I wonder if there's a mod for that?
        Oh I definitely still own it. Just haven't played much of my 360 games ever since the XBone came out and then life started punching me in the face.

And yeah I just played through Halo 3 and felt the same way. Lots of edges everywhere that I don't remember.
    They could make a pile on a minimal-effort re-release. I’d love to be able to play it on a current gen console.
Yup never played either Portal games, nor have I watched any playthroughs or watching or read anything about it. Maybe I should do a stream of it to record my virgin reactions.

    The moonshot was just a brilliant scene. The focus shifting to it, the delay (I read it's the real speed of light to the moon delay), then just all hell breaks loose. Space core flying by. Definitely in my top 5 game moments in anything.
    Haha, I thought exactly the same! I remember thinking "Shit, no surfaces to portal on... but wait... is that the moon?! Would that work? It would be genius if it did..."
I couldn't even imagine that the plot might be myself. So many possibilities, so little ability to count to 3...
Thank you! I promise I hadn't planned this all out from the offset.
I was so surprised to hear JK Simmons as voice of Cave Johnson, I really loved his work, also Stephen Merchant's work. 

And I loved the character of GlaDOS, loved her passive aggressiveness, how she keeps reminding Chell that she killed her mercilessly, her slow claps. 10/10 character writing.
    One of my favorite parts of the game is when you’re finally entering >!Wheatley’s Lair, and GLaDOS gives you the pep talk about revenge, and you realize that you’ve been completely forgiven for the events of the first game because otherwise you’d both get annihilated!<
That’s what really makes the scene for me. The way she gets fired up while trapped in a potato perched on your portal gun.
    #Take the lemons! Burn his house down!
        It’s also not a bad “show don’t tell” type of scene. She starts reacting to a voice from her past and suddenly, she’s infantalized. She’s vulnerable. This ruthless AI wuvs her papa. It’s a great story-telling moment where she’s more human than AI. It makes the player empathize/sympathize with a computer.
yea I already did ;) They are great
 "Plus, we fire the whole bullet. Thats 65% more bullet per bullet."
They shoot the whole bullet. They don’t waste any part of it
already started ;) It really is. My friends are just not very online so it will take a while..
So they can bring it back with the AI robots.  Plenty of good ways to continue it without ruining the original story.
I want Chell to meet up with Gordon Freeman.  


That drydock in "Olde Aperture" .... Blew. My. Mind.
Truly
Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
    Oh how we laughed and laughed
        Except I wasn’t laughing
            Under the circumstances I’ve been shockingly nice
That was impressive af (even tho any% is crazy and cool as shit I still like glitchless runs the best)

        4 hours later and I got to hear that sweet ending song, I forgot how good portal 2 was
To be fair I was in my teens and have had other games hit me in other ways like Nier:Automata
Yeah, that makes total sense. I still wish it could come out tho lol
    Will not happen ever. I would eat a raw uncooked boot before it ever did and you can hold me to that
Yup. I got it mixed up a bit though. This year will be 50 years since it was sealed

https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Test_Shaft_09
lol yea I figured it more as a joke. But it would be fun if motion sick wasn't an issue. 

https://store.steampowered.com/app/446750/Portal_Stories_VR/

from 2016, dang
    That’s not really portal though is it? Aside from using the same graphical assets, it’s has barely anything in common as the gameplay changes a lot. I’m not sure an actual portal game would work in VR.
        What do you mean? It is a community made mod, so its not like its from valve but its a mod of portal. And yea I have now idea how it is, I just thought I would post as he mentioned a mod was already made.
            I know it’s just a mod, I’m saying the gameplay has nothing to do with portal. Aside from using the same assets to make it look visually the same, it has nothing to do with Portal.

In other words, if this game had different art and was released standalone, I would never think “damn this reminds me so much of portal!”
                Oh dam so there's no portals in it?
                    Yep, for some reason someone thought that was a good idea
                        Well thanks for clearing that up. Take it off my game list for when I finally get VR
                            No problem! 

No need to take it off though, it’s still entertaining for a while and since it’s super small (less than 30 minutes I think?) and free, you don’t lose anything trying it :) it’s just a bit frustrating to play because you’ll be thinking “damn, they had such a good opportunity to make portal in vr why did they do it this way?”
Bit trippy til you get used to it 😅, In my head I was thinking the opposite in terms of the 4d but really neat concept. Small thing was the aspect ratio thing was messed up for me and couldn't get it to fully fit my screen properly 🤷‍♂️
My brain melted from the puzzles
You need the base game tho
I really enjoyed it but I also didn’t experience any bugs. The story was just intriguing enough to keep me interested and I liked the puzzle design. I played through the whole thing in a weekend
I'll second The Witness. Literally broke my brain for a few weeks after I got to a certain point.
lol nope all I’ve got is a 2013 MacBook and the new Xbox. Looking to build one soon whenever graphics cards are reasonably obtainable
[1920x1200](https://i.imgur.com/5nrNZGP.jpg)
Yeah, I'm not holding my breath. If they'd just allow the game to be streamed, I'd be happy.

Note: it might already be allowed but not on the PSN.
You think so? I just built my computer a month ago but I can't get my hands on a GPU (fucking miners).
    A modern iGPU can run it pretty well. Even the iGPU of the i5 6600t can run it at reduced resolution. My laptop with Iris XE iGPU can run it maxed out at 1080p.
Je vais ordonner à mes ingénieurs de monter des rotules sur ta maison pour pouvoir les lui péter !
    This is exceptionally pleasing to me. I now wish to replay this masterpiece en francais.

    I love Cara Mia Addio so much. Ellen McClain improvised a lot of the Italian on the spot.
        It was so good! I play through the game every once in a while just to hear "The Turret Concierto!"
    Should've been the actual ending credits song, imo.
        Idk want you gone still gives me chills every time I hear it
            Yes. Want you gone and Still alive are so brilliant
            Unpopular opinion, i know.  But "Want You Gone" doesnt hit the same as "Still Alive."
The right woman in the wrong place, can make all the difference in the world.
Zoinks, Chell's mom?
    There’s a whole thing on glades and thus Caroline and cave Jonson actually being chells mom it’s never been proven tho and even Glados’s actress dosnt know.

(EDIT) Im updating this since I honestly didn’t expect this to gain so much attention. 

The whole chells mom thing is a popular theory that hasn’t been proven, the only hints are cara Mia (turret opera) and Easter eggs. Glados’s voice actor has stated tho that cara Mia was her own idea it was also done from her memory Latin as a kid hence why the translation is bad as it’s mostly not recognizable. 

Look into it if your curious it’s a fun ride.
        I believe the developers said that Glados wasn't part of the original project, but that the test players felt the game needed an antagonist, so they added it
            This was also extremely early on in development
                Glados made the game.
                    Agreed
                    It really did. Even if they just had an announcer (and even a good one like Cave Johnson) the game would have lacked the soul it has now.
                        Go  play the  addon mel  on steam  cave jonhson talk most of the time
                    Actually, Valve did.
                        Did you know the cake is a lie?
                    Absolutely. Some dialogue interactions had me dieing laughing. Also I guess we can't really call it interactions because we never do respond to Glados, ever. So she is really talking to herself. Such a great game.
                The game ended up VERY different from how it started out :-) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narbacular_Drop

There’s actually a playable version of the original somewhere in the intertubes.
                    The same school had another student game called "Tag:The Power of Paint" iirc. In it you had a gun that painted surfaces with different colors, which would change how that surface reacted to the player.

One color would make you run fast, anther would make you bounce off the surface, and a third would make you stick to it and rotate your perspective.

Valve hired that group of students and put the concept into Portal 2.
                        Ah!  Cool to know. Digipen seems to have had some pretty good students.
                    I remember playing this! I always said portal was a copy. I never remembered the name, and people doubted it's existence, but here it is!
                    Was free way back. I played it at some point or another.
            the test players felt the game needed ~~an antagonist~~ a beacon of light
        >cave Jonson actually being chells mom

CAVE JOHNSON IS HER MOM?
            My engineers tried telling me drinking moon rock gel would make me infertile.  To hell with them I say! Just to prove them wrong, I'll have my own damn kid,  and when I do it,  I'm going to be both the father and the mother! Let's get to some science.
                It's been 10 years, but I can still hear that man's voice in my head.
                    I'm willing to bet it's been less than 10 years since you've heard JK Simmons' voice, though.
                        The man is a freaking treasure. He seems to just really embrace the crazy in every part he plays.
                    Me too, just now it has to do with insurance
                    This is true! 😂
                    Do you know who I am?

I'm the man whos gonna burn your house down!

With the lemons!
                Why does this make me feel it's more likely as opposed to less likely?
            Hey gang! Cave Johnson here! 

I'm just popping in to clear up some confusion. There have been some rumors that I have been engaging in relationships with Aperture employees that would be considered inappropriate for the workplace. Let me assure you, these rumors are absolutely false. There have also been rumors that I may or may not have sired certain children with certain people who may or may not have been my personal assistant, who I may or may not have arranged to be digitally copied to develop an AI to run the company once I finally succumb to this terrible illness that may or may not have been caused by powered moon rocks that I may or may not have also tried snorting one time in the 80's while trying to find new marketable applications for existing products. Let me assure you, that these rumors are absolutely true - but only under well defined probabilistic scenarios.

Let me explain. See, a few years back the boys in engineering started having trouble coming up with new ideas for products. We tried everything! We tried a portal gun with one entrance and two exits. We tried a new gel that makes literally anything it touches spontaneously combust. We even had a period where we considered getting back to our roots, so to speak, and making shower curtains again! Eventually we settled on the last idea we'd ever need, the Aperture Science Perpetual Testing Initiative. Now that we have access to the multiverse, we no longer need to come up with ideas, we can just steal them from some other version of ourselves! So what does this have to do with the rumors from earlier? Well, there are infinite multiverses, each with differences that could be minor, such as one guy having a minor corporate policy violation that's being blown way out of proportion by HR, or they could be significant changes affecting the entire human race. Case in point, the Cave Johnson addressing you right now is actually not human at all, but from a multiverse where everyone is actually a ferret. So you see, given the infinite variables between infinite multiverses, there is almost certainly one where the events being described have come to pass. But it's not this one! Nope! No sir! I give you my word. And it's like my father always told me, "Cave, a ferret that can't give you their word isn't a ferret, but a weasel." 

Anyway, I think that should clear up all of the confusion, so I won't bother talking about how you can contact me if you have anymore questions, since obviously there won't be any. 

Thanks,
-- Cave
                You are a delight

        Really? I just played through it again recently and I thought they were pretty clear about glados being her mother.
        Wasn't Glados played by multiple actors?
            No, GLaDOS was voiced by a single person, Ellen McLain.
                I thought the singer from Faith No More voiced one of her personalities in Portal 2
                    Nah, this is his starring role in the game 

https://youtu.be/HOhLgfQqg_g
            Damn just downvote this guy for being curious lol
                I found that a bit interesting.
                Proper reddit etiquette is to answer with words instead of downvotes!
    There's a part in the game where you come across science projects created by the kids of the workers, and one of them is signed by "Chell".

Could be just a random easter egg, but it's likely that she's at least the daughter of *someone* who worked there.
        True, but it's also canon that she's adopted. Cave Johnson and Caroline could well be her biological parents though.
            GLaDOS *says* she's adopted, but GLaDOS talks mad shit.
                Yes, but the context, both GLaDOS and Wheatley say she's adopted. GLaDOS could simply have denied it, but she didn't, in fact she confirmed it, and *sympathized* with Chell about it.
            Is it? I don't really fully trust whatever GLaDOS says.
                Both Wheatley and GLaDOS state it as fact, and at that point GLaDOS is on Chell's side.
                    Oh, I didn't remember that.

Still, they didn't say *when* she was adopted, did they? She can be a worker's adopted daughter, no?
Very likely Chell's mother. Per the Ratman comics, Doug took her as his own to hide the fact that the boss and his assistant were having an affair.
    Portal 2 is one of my all time favorite games, but I have no idea what you just said.
        Doug Rattmann is the guy that wrote all the cake is a lie graffiti in the games. An old aperture science employee that survived glados killing everyone and went crazy living in the walls of the facility. 

They put out some comics called Ratman about Rattmann. I havent read them, so I can't tell you what happens in them. But seems like this person is saying Rattmann was chell's adopted parent? Raising her instead of Cave and Caroline? This is the first i'm hearing about it too. Not crazy about the idea.
            He was schizophrenic and ran out of meds.
        There's a comic book (I believe it's just called "Ratman"), where in we see Doug Ratman, the man who left all of the messages behind the walls in both games (as he slowly went insane). In the comic, it's revealed that his daughter was taken at take your daughter to work day (the day Glados was turned on) into the test subject pool. I haven't read it myself but it's apparent in the comic that 1) his daughter isn't biologically his 2) he "adopted" her from a coworker 3) he's resentful toward Cave & Caroline through his career. Putting that together, it's pretty strongly implied that Chell is the abandoned daughter of Caroline and Cave who was raised by Ratman (also why Glados relentlessly calls you adopted).
            Ohhh GladOS is that cold.
            That's pretty far off into crazy fan-theory land, though, and I think you're just misremembering; the take you daughter to work day isn't in the comic at all, and the same comic has him bumping Chell up to #1 on the list of test subjects for Portal 1 because the reason she was originally rejected from testing altogether was that her "tenacity" score was off the charts. Nothing in the text states or implies he knows her at all, much less that she's his adopted kid- the companion cube asks how he knew about her and says "know what?" and it was "something in her file". He's not trying to save her at that point (he is trying to save her after she's recaptured at the end of Portal 1), he's just picking someone out of the files that can fight back.
                thank you for the clarification, I must be misremembering.
    GLaDOS is likely Chell's mom. Chell's Potato Battery science fair display is visible from the Bring Your Daughter To Work Day, so she was certainly the daughter of an employee.
But Caroline is American and Cave Johnson is American, so it doesn't make sense because Chell is asian
    Caroline's last name can't be Li? Have you never met an Asian person who "sounded American"?
        Here's an [in-game portrait](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/half-life/images/0/07/Cave_caroline_70s.png/revision/latest?cb=20120621160408&path-prefix=en) of the two of them. I wouldn't say she looks particularly asian.
            Clearly this image is quite off. Doesn't look anything like the teacher from Whiplash.
                But it kinda resembles that guy from that prison documentary
        I am Asian
            I am Groot
    When is this ever stated lol. If anything Chell looks a little like Caroline when you think about it.
        "Chell is modeled after actress Alésia Glidewell, and appears to be of mixed-race white European and East or Southeast Asian background, with dark hair and blue eyes."

Source: https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Chell
            Wow that's interesting! Thanks.
                I went to college with her.
                    Nice.
                No problem
Where do you find this gloriously obnoxious tune??!!
Stephen Merchant should have been cast as Vision in the MCU.
    He was very good in Logan (2017) as Caliban
If that is how you play you mean. You can see her everytime you open a portal!
    Not every time. You only see yourself if the other portal faces your current position.
        \*sigh\* You are technically correct. The best kind of correct.
Wait, Chell is the companion cube? How? Time travel? Cloning?
Portal 2 had more challenging puzzles but design that led you to grow into the puzzles very smoothly. There were still plenty of moments of having to work things out (at least for me).

But portal 2 also contains probably the greatest “puzzle” design of all time. They seed the moon rock = portal carrier stuff into the game just enough to lodge it in your head without making it feel like a Chekhov’s Gun. So when you’re in your death throes and the the ceiling opens to show the moon, the solution is instantly obvious and yet allows the player to feel smart in that moment. And the satisfaction from seeing your portal glint off the moon (I think they showed that portals propagate at c) was immense.
    Funny story: they calculated how long it should take to see the glint (because of the speed of light) but they couldn't use it because it was too slow and a lot of players looked away before they saw it.
        2.6 seconds is an eternity for a gamer
            More like 5 seconds for the round trip, assuming the gun works at the speed of light.
                But it only takes 1.3 to get to the moon and 1.3 for the light to come back.
                    Huh, you're right. I've been off by a factor of 2 for years.
            Fuck I just laughed out loud on a bus with only one other person and they are looking at me like I am strange.
        There's a sign in 2 that says something like: In case of reactor implosion, look directly at implosion. 

AFAIK they put that sign in because they worked hard on the animation of the implosion and play testers never saw it because they turned around to keep playing. Should've put up a sign like that on the moon.
        I've heard somewhere they also programmed it so that no matter what button you choose (orange or blue portal), it will be the correct portal on the moon matching the one that's already on the ground. Because people couldn't think which was the right color in the moment. I know I definitely didn't remember which one I should be pressing lol.
            I remember hearing, probably in the commentary, that there are a few places that automatically switch the color of the last portal so that no matter which one you fire it's the right one. I think it's when you're in a funnel being projected into a portal.

And several of the long flings, if your speed is within a range it will adjust it to be exactly the right speed to make the landing.
    I still remember how I felt when I saw the moon. Just sheer excitement about what was about to happen when I fired that portal.
        Truly one of the greatest moments in gaming. That shift from "oh wow, the moon" to "wait, what if--" to "HOLY SHIT THIS IS GODDAMNED EPIC" ... perfection.
            Yeah, that's one of my all-time gaming HOLY SHIT moments.  Really great.
        I wanted to say PORTALS ON THE MOON on my fb feed but I didn't wanna be a spoiler.
    This was a really well written analysis of why the moon reveal is so poignant and why I have never met anyone that didn’t get the reveal.
I kinda agree, i think portal 1 was really a puzzle game with a really original story, while portal 2 was more a linear story game with puzzles.

For me the 2 was harder, i struggled a lot, especially with the "old" aperture with the gels and all
    Yeah, I see a lot of people say that the first was more challenging. But I breezed through most of those puzzles. The second was much harder for me when you get to the old section.
        Portal was a freebie with the Half-Life 2 set that had all the HL2 games. I remember finishing the last of HL2 well after midnight and thinking "well let's see what Portal is" and it was just the nicest dessert after the long slog that is HL2. No headcrabs, no moaning zombie corpses that throw headcrabs at you, just some puzzles and that lovely wit.

*Are you still there?*
            By dessert, you mean cake right?
        That's mostly because when you played the first game, you weren't used to thinking with portals yet. By the sequel, you've had some experience and have already familiarized yourself with the concept.

Still found 2 harder though.
    There was gel puzzle or two that I still don't know if I did it right or if I just did it in a way that worked.
Most of the more difficult puzzles in Portal 2 are in the co-op mode.
weirdly enough, Portal 1 was more challenging, but it was a whole lot more intuitive for first-time players (maybe because its graphics were so basic?)

I'm saying this because I've seen people learning to 'think with portals' on both games, and the experience is different. On Portal 1, I had no need to explain what is happening, people always figure out what the portal gun does, and it was always fun to watch the brainfuck

On Portal 2, god, I've seen friends spend nearly an hour and not understanding what the portals do, until I had to explain it
Check out portal stories: Mel for that good challenge
I feel like Portal 1 had more reactionary puzzles which can be more difficult for some.  What I mean by that is more puzzles where you have to shoot another portal in mid air, usually with a relatively small target too.  I don't think portal 2 had as many as those...
Yes, exactly!  Portal 2 was too damn easy throughout.  "Oh, it must be the only clean spot that I can shoot a portal on!"
    It's the tragedy of modern puzzle games where markers point out the answer. In the old Tomb Raider games you could spend ages on a tomb. Now it's a matter of looking for the white paint on the ledge and the glowing cliff face for you to climb. I think excesive play testing has killed challenging games.
I agree sadly, since Portal 2 had a lot more mechanics, but I seemed to rely less on stretching possibilities because of this. The custom maps are damn hard, though.
I actually love how the world was expanded upon in a way consistent with 1. Old Aperture is amazing, its whole feel is simultaneously nostalgic and foreboding and as you explore the story, it becomes moving. Then you return to the new laboratories and your relationship with GLaDOS has been changed radically.

None of the new characters introduced felt superfluous or like they ruin the vibe of 1, which to me is *incredible*. Overall tremendous writing in both games. 1 was lovely, but what 2 did with that story was just a masterpiece. It's been years and I'm still in love with the entire thing.
    I absolutely love the design of Old Aperture. All of the button illumination, checkboxes, and counters were Nixie tubes. And the test spheres have such a neat design to them.
    What I don’t like about 2 is how self aware it feels. Like a lot of the old aperture puzzles feel like you just need to search the huge room for 10 minutes to find the one white spot to put the portal on and solve the puzzle, but it’s framed as you’re outside the testing chambers in the open so there should be more possibilities? Something about it doesn’t feel right to me. Also personally Wheatley got really old.
        Agreed - I loved the game and overall it was only a minor gripe for me, but the fact that it wasn't more "sandboxy" did take me out of the game a little bit.
        Well the portals only work on surfaces covered with moon dust iirc
            Yeah but it didn’t feel like you were exploring the world when there was always exactly one white panel exactly where you needed it. It makes the puzzles less satisfying, as opposed to 1 where for most puzzles you could put them almost anywhere but it wouldn’t accomplish anything if you didn’t have a plan
                You are making some very solid points that I didn't even notice. Loved the game but yeah you are right.
    I completed the game in a single sitting. By the time I got to the old chambers I was getting real tired and taking so long to figure out the puzzles cause of it. But that only helped to make the atmosphere even mor emoody for me. So many good memories of this one.
I totally get that. But the story also needed it to be the way it was.
First thing I did is went to the store and it makes me have to pay for it. I'm playing Half-Life right now, and its the same copy I had when I was a kid. So it's very weird.
    I just checked mine. Although I still have it the total playtime has been reset to 5 hours, and I have so much more than that put into it.
        Yeah, my playtime on Half-Life got reset

The Orange Box, Ep 1
That's how you get threes from Valve: make them all a two
    This is starting to feel like the math classes I failed
Happy cake day! Here's your free purple box!
    I had no idea it was my cake day. Thanks!!
    The cake is a lie!
It's not necessarily synonymous. Boxes can be rectangular solids too. They don't have to have equal sides like cubes do.
    Yeah but, cubed. The three 3 titles, dude was right, math nerds would love it lol, I do.
        Not sure why this is downvoted but people may be missing the logic - 3 by 3 by 3 would be a cube
It could ship inside of a used condom and I would still tear into it with both hands and a smile.
Downloading now, it looks interesting. Thanks for the heads up.
    No problem. It is a real mind fuck of a mod
I'm still waiting for Valve to make their games 64-bit for Catalina.
I will also confirm this, as I played through it last year sometime. Definitely very well made and worth playing if you've played 1 and 2 and want more portal.

However, don't expect it to add anything game-changing. It's like an expansion pack on an existing game, more than any sort of subsequent installment. It is a mod, after all.
    It's huge though. I think it does a good job of showing the limits of the Portal concept/engine. By the end of Mel all the Portal'ing is spent in me and I'm ready for a break.   
Then in a year or two I go back and start all over at Portal 1
    Commenting on a portal thread on cake day! Nice! Happy cake day!
        Pretty sure it was yesterday, but I'll take it! Playing Portal 1 right now too.
            Well depending on how far you've got a long... The cake is a lie.. Or is it.
Insane yes, but I'm not sure it's be that fun in VR. Doing a ceiling to floor loop into a jump might be a little bit jarring on the brain. Lol
    imagine the people gel that was scraped in Portal 2 made a reappearance in vr
        You mean the gel that supposedly let you walk on walls?
    According to the developers, this is the exact reason why they dropped a VR Portal in favor of Alyx
    Sounds rather nauseating.  Those bits where you bounce up and down she does a little spin.
    As someone who gets serious simulation sickness, I feel nauseated just thinking about it.
Oh im hoping it will happen for sure.  
There was a lot of angry screaming when Alyx came along though. :')
    it's been 10 years. i wouldn't count on it anymore
    Portal VR! Yay!

(Gets downvoted into oblivion)
I get motion sick in VR from just *walking.* I'm sure as hell not about to go jumping through ceilings and shit.
In theory of course you are completely correct.

In actuality, sequels of legendary games made by new teams almost never go well. Is there an example of it ever going well? I can't think of one.
    New vegas maybe?

>>Unfortunately, most of the people who made Portal what it is are no longer at Valve. Kim Swift, who produced Narbacular Drop, the student game that eventually turned into Portal, left Valve in 2009 and now works for Electronic Arts. Writer Erik Wolpaw took off in early 2017 to work on Double Fine's Psychonauts 2, another long-awaited sequel. Chet Faliszek, Wolpaw's co-writer, left a few months later, saying that he needed a change of pace after spending 12 years at the company. Doug Wood, one of Portal 2's designers and animators, retired in 2016. Josh Weier, Portal 2's project lead, departed shortly thereafter.

most notable Portal developers left already
    Wolpaw was contracted to help out with writing Alyx, so temporary returns are possible.
    Kim Swift really downgraded there when it comes to integrity
        I'll bet he's making more money though
[deleted]
    Just watched. Awesome. Can't wait to get home.
I think they're just not very interested anymore. Clearly certain people and divisions work on new games here and there, but it's been a long, long time since Valve needed to make games to rake in shitloads of money.
    Valve actually wanted to continue making games for a long time, they just had their idea of a flat work structure, where devs could basically choose on whatever project they want to do, which led to devs starting a massive amount of projects, but then never finishing them when they encounter larger problems. They finally fixed it with Alyx since they needed a release to advertise the Valve index.



There is the visual book series of a valve Dec called final hours: "insert game" who in the newest installment, Half-Life: Alyx - Final Hours mentioned (IIRC) three different attempts on making a half life three since portal 2 came out, which all failed to be developed fully.
Ah! *Bach*

ahhh... "Bach"

    I was just going to say that. Since valve made that mod after all, I think its canon enough for me.
You mean frontman of Mr. Bungle, Mondo Cane, Tomahawk, Fantomas, Moonchild, Dead Cross, and Hemophiliac, guest of Secret Chiefs 3, The Young Gods, Zu, and more? THAT Mike Patton? Dude's a slacker.
    I’m a Lovage kinda guy myself
I liked that core the most
Okay, look, we both said a lot of things that you're going to regret.
YOU WHAT??
    Okay look, we both said a lot of things that you’re going to regret
Honestly anything other than "two timelines" would be essentially impossible to make puzzles with without being absurdly, impossibly hard. Plus how'd you do that with portals? They're very binary things save in placement.
    Well maybe you could make a portal that goes one second in the past, allowing you to clone things? Or one second in the future, allowing you to dodge otherwise undodgeable attacks?
        The thinking with time machine Portal 2 mod from forever ago is free on steam and adds this!
            there's another portal time mod??? ohno
                It’s been out since 2014, and it’s really challenging, fun, and free! [Here’s the steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286080/Thinking_with_Time_Machine/)
        What I mean to say is the "ideal" test becomes impossible- either the mechanics are so broken the solution is too simple, or the solution is so complex that no one but the creator can ever do it.
You okay man? Maybe being on Reddit isn’t a good idea right now
Most test subjects do experience some cognitive deterioration after a few months in suspension...
    Haha. I was tired
You should probably wait a little until you don’t remember much of the puzzles anymore
If you don't own it anymore it's very cheap. It's excellent even after this much time. My only caveat to it was that it didn't look as good as I remembered since I was playing on an HD monitor- I saw more hard polygon edges than I recalled, I saw some of the tricks they use to keep memory use down and make the lighting better than the engine can handle. 

I'd actually be curious what the game would look like if they did a remake with modern graphics- I wonder if there's a mod for that?
    Oh I definitely still own it. Just haven't played much of my 360 games ever since the XBone came out and then life started punching me in the face.

And yeah I just played through Halo 3 and felt the same way. Lots of edges everywhere that I don't remember.
They could make a pile on a minimal-effort re-release. I’d love to be able to play it on a current gen console.
The moonshot was just a brilliant scene. The focus shifting to it, the delay (I read it's the real speed of light to the moon delay), then just all hell breaks loose. Space core flying by. Definitely in my top 5 game moments in anything.
Haha, I thought exactly the same! I remember thinking "Shit, no surfaces to portal on... but wait... is that the moon?! Would that work? It would be genius if it did..."
One of my favorite parts of the game is when you’re finally entering >!Wheatley’s Lair, and GLaDOS gives you the pep talk about revenge, and you realize that you’ve been completely forgiven for the events of the first game because otherwise you’d both get annihilated!<
#Take the lemons! Burn his house down!
    It’s also not a bad “show don’t tell” type of scene. She starts reacting to a voice from her past and suddenly, she’s infantalized. She’s vulnerable. This ruthless AI wuvs her papa. It’s a great story-telling moment where she’s more human than AI. It makes the player empathize/sympathize with a computer.
Oh how we laughed and laughed
    Except I wasn’t laughing
        Under the circumstances I’ve been shockingly nice
[deleted]
    4 hours later and I got to hear that sweet ending song, I forgot how good portal 2 was
Will not happen ever. I would eat a raw uncooked boot before it ever did and you can hold me to that
That’s not really portal though is it? Aside from using the same graphical assets, it’s has barely anything in common as the gameplay changes a lot. I’m not sure an actual portal game would work in VR.
    What do you mean? It is a community made mod, so its not like its from valve but its a mod of portal. And yea I have now idea how it is, I just thought I would post as he mentioned a mod was already made.
        I know it’s just a mod, I’m saying the gameplay has nothing to do with portal. Aside from using the same assets to make it look visually the same, it has nothing to do with Portal.

In other words, if this game had different art and was released standalone, I would never think “damn this reminds me so much of portal!”
            Oh dam so there's no portals in it?
                Yep, for some reason someone thought that was a good idea
                    Well thanks for clearing that up. Take it off my game list for when I finally get VR
                        No problem! 

No need to take it off though, it’s still entertaining for a while and since it’s super small (less than 30 minutes I think?) and free, you don’t lose anything trying it :) it’s just a bit frustrating to play because you’ll be thinking “damn, they had such a good opportunity to make portal in vr why did they do it this way?”
A modern iGPU can run it pretty well. Even the iGPU of the i5 6600t can run it at reduced resolution. My laptop with Iris XE iGPU can run it maxed out at 1080p.
This is exceptionally pleasing to me. I now wish to replay this masterpiece en francais.
I love Cara Mia Addio so much. Ellen McClain improvised a lot of the Italian on the spot.
    It was so good! I play through the game every once in a while just to hear "The Turret Concierto!"
Should've been the actual ending credits song, imo.
    Idk want you gone still gives me chills every time I hear it
        Yes. Want you gone and Still alive are so brilliant
        Unpopular opinion, i know.  But "Want You Gone" doesnt hit the same as "Still Alive."
There’s a whole thing on glades and thus Caroline and cave Jonson actually being chells mom it’s never been proven tho and even Glados’s actress dosnt know.

(EDIT) Im updating this since I honestly didn’t expect this to gain so much attention. 

The whole chells mom thing is a popular theory that hasn’t been proven, the only hints are cara Mia (turret opera) and Easter eggs. Glados’s voice actor has stated tho that cara Mia was her own idea it was also done from her memory Latin as a kid hence why the translation is bad as it’s mostly not recognizable. 

Look into it if your curious it’s a fun ride.
    I believe the developers said that Glados wasn't part of the original project, but that the test players felt the game needed an antagonist, so they added it
        This was also extremely early on in development
            Glados made the game.
                Agreed
                It really did. Even if they just had an announcer (and even a good one like Cave Johnson) the game would have lacked the soul it has now.
                    Go  play the  addon mel  on steam  cave jonhson talk most of the time
                Actually, Valve did.
                    Did you know the cake is a lie?
                Absolutely. Some dialogue interactions had me dieing laughing. Also I guess we can't really call it interactions because we never do respond to Glados, ever. So she is really talking to herself. Such a great game.
            The game ended up VERY different from how it started out :-) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narbacular_Drop

There’s actually a playable version of the original somewhere in the intertubes.
                The same school had another student game called "Tag:The Power of Paint" iirc. In it you had a gun that painted surfaces with different colors, which would change how that surface reacted to the player.

One color would make you run fast, anther would make you bounce off the surface, and a third would make you stick to it and rotate your perspective.

Valve hired that group of students and put the concept into Portal 2.
                    Ah!  Cool to know. Digipen seems to have had some pretty good students.
                I remember playing this! I always said portal was a copy. I never remembered the name, and people doubted it's existence, but here it is!
                Was free way back. I played it at some point or another.
        the test players felt the game needed ~~an antagonist~~ a beacon of light
    >cave Jonson actually being chells mom

CAVE JOHNSON IS HER MOM?
        My engineers tried telling me drinking moon rock gel would make me infertile.  To hell with them I say! Just to prove them wrong, I'll have my own damn kid,  and when I do it,  I'm going to be both the father and the mother! Let's get to some science.
            It's been 10 years, but I can still hear that man's voice in my head.
                I'm willing to bet it's been less than 10 years since you've heard JK Simmons' voice, though.
                    The man is a freaking treasure. He seems to just really embrace the crazy in every part he plays.
                Me too, just now it has to do with insurance
                This is true! 😂
                Do you know who I am?

I'm the man whos gonna burn your house down!

With the lemons!
            Why does this make me feel it's more likely as opposed to less likely?
        Hey gang! Cave Johnson here! 

I'm just popping in to clear up some confusion. There have been some rumors that I have been engaging in relationships with Aperture employees that would be considered inappropriate for the workplace. Let me assure you, these rumors are absolutely false. There have also been rumors that I may or may not have sired certain children with certain people who may or may not have been my personal assistant, who I may or may not have arranged to be digitally copied to develop an AI to run the company once I finally succumb to this terrible illness that may or may not have been caused by powered moon rocks that I may or may not have also tried snorting one time in the 80's while trying to find new marketable applications for existing products. Let me assure you, that these rumors are absolutely true - but only under well defined probabilistic scenarios.

Let me explain. See, a few years back the boys in engineering started having trouble coming up with new ideas for products. We tried everything! We tried a portal gun with one entrance and two exits. We tried a new gel that makes literally anything it touches spontaneously combust. We even had a period where we considered getting back to our roots, so to speak, and making shower curtains again! Eventually we settled on the last idea we'd ever need, the Aperture Science Perpetual Testing Initiative. Now that we have access to the multiverse, we no longer need to come up with ideas, we can just steal them from some other version of ourselves! So what does this have to do with the rumors from earlier? Well, there are infinite multiverses, each with differences that could be minor, such as one guy having a minor corporate policy violation that's being blown way out of proportion by HR, or they could be significant changes affecting the entire human race. Case in point, the Cave Johnson addressing you right now is actually not human at all, but from a multiverse where everyone is actually a ferret. So you see, given the infinite variables between infinite multiverses, there is almost certainly one where the events being described have come to pass. But it's not this one! Nope! No sir! I give you my word. And it's like my father always told me, "Cave, a ferret that can't give you their word isn't a ferret, but a weasel." 

Anyway, I think that should clear up all of the confusion, so I won't bother talking about how you can contact me if you have anymore questions, since obviously there won't be any. 

Thanks,
-- Cave
            You are a delight

    Really? I just played through it again recently and I thought they were pretty clear about glados being her mother.
    Wasn't Glados played by multiple actors?
        No, GLaDOS was voiced by a single person, Ellen McLain.
            I thought the singer from Faith No More voiced one of her personalities in Portal 2
                Nah, this is his starring role in the game 

https://youtu.be/HOhLgfQqg_g
        Damn just downvote this guy for being curious lol
            I found that a bit interesting.
            Proper reddit etiquette is to answer with words instead of downvotes!
There's a part in the game where you come across science projects created by the kids of the workers, and one of them is signed by "Chell".

Could be just a random easter egg, but it's likely that she's at least the daughter of *someone* who worked there.
    True, but it's also canon that she's adopted. Cave Johnson and Caroline could well be her biological parents though.
        GLaDOS *says* she's adopted, but GLaDOS talks mad shit.
            Yes, but the context, both GLaDOS and Wheatley say she's adopted. GLaDOS could simply have denied it, but she didn't, in fact she confirmed it, and *sympathized* with Chell about it.
        Is it? I don't really fully trust whatever GLaDOS says.
            Both Wheatley and GLaDOS state it as fact, and at that point GLaDOS is on Chell's side.
                Oh, I didn't remember that.

Still, they didn't say *when* she was adopted, did they? She can be a worker's adopted daughter, no?
Portal 2 is one of my all time favorite games, but I have no idea what you just said.
    Doug Rattmann is the guy that wrote all the cake is a lie graffiti in the games. An old aperture science employee that survived glados killing everyone and went crazy living in the walls of the facility. 

They put out some comics called Ratman about Rattmann. I havent read them, so I can't tell you what happens in them. But seems like this person is saying Rattmann was chell's adopted parent? Raising her instead of Cave and Caroline? This is the first i'm hearing about it too. Not crazy about the idea.
        He was schizophrenic and ran out of meds.
    There's a comic book (I believe it's just called "Ratman"), where in we see Doug Ratman, the man who left all of the messages behind the walls in both games (as he slowly went insane). In the comic, it's revealed that his daughter was taken at take your daughter to work day (the day Glados was turned on) into the test subject pool. I haven't read it myself but it's apparent in the comic that 1) his daughter isn't biologically his 2) he "adopted" her from a coworker 3) he's resentful toward Cave & Caroline through his career. Putting that together, it's pretty strongly implied that Chell is the abandoned daughter of Caroline and Cave who was raised by Ratman (also why Glados relentlessly calls you adopted).
        Ohhh GladOS is that cold.
        That's pretty far off into crazy fan-theory land, though, and I think you're just misremembering; the take you daughter to work day isn't in the comic at all, and the same comic has him bumping Chell up to #1 on the list of test subjects for Portal 1 because the reason she was originally rejected from testing altogether was that her "tenacity" score was off the charts. Nothing in the text states or implies he knows her at all, much less that she's his adopted kid- the companion cube asks how he knew about her and says "know what?" and it was "something in her file". He's not trying to save her at that point (he is trying to save her after she's recaptured at the end of Portal 1), he's just picking someone out of the files that can fight back.
            thank you for the clarification, I must be misremembering.
GLaDOS is likely Chell's mom. Chell's Potato Battery science fair display is visible from the Bring Your Daughter To Work Day, so she was certainly the daughter of an employee.
Caroline's last name can't be Li? Have you never met an Asian person who "sounded American"?
    Here's an [in-game portrait](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/half-life/images/0/07/Cave_caroline_70s.png/revision/latest?cb=20120621160408&path-prefix=en) of the two of them. I wouldn't say she looks particularly asian.
        Clearly this image is quite off. Doesn't look anything like the teacher from Whiplash.
            But it kinda resembles that guy from that prison documentary
    I am Asian
        I am Groot
When is this ever stated lol. If anything Chell looks a little like Caroline when you think about it.
    "Chell is modeled after actress Alésia Glidewell, and appears to be of mixed-race white European and East or Southeast Asian background, with dark hair and blue eyes."

Source: https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Chell
        Wow that's interesting! Thanks.
            I went to college with her.
                Nice.
            No problem
He was very good in Logan (2017) as Caliban
Not every time. You only see yourself if the other portal faces your current position.
    \*sigh\* You are technically correct. The best kind of correct.
Funny story: they calculated how long it should take to see the glint (because of the speed of light) but they couldn't use it because it was too slow and a lot of players looked away before they saw it.
    2.6 seconds is an eternity for a gamer
        More like 5 seconds for the round trip, assuming the gun works at the speed of light.
            But it only takes 1.3 to get to the moon and 1.3 for the light to come back.
                Huh, you're right. I've been off by a factor of 2 for years.
        Fuck I just laughed out loud on a bus with only one other person and they are looking at me like I am strange.
    There's a sign in 2 that says something like: In case of reactor implosion, look directly at implosion. 

AFAIK they put that sign in because they worked hard on the animation of the implosion and play testers never saw it because they turned around to keep playing. Should've put up a sign like that on the moon.
    I've heard somewhere they also programmed it so that no matter what button you choose (orange or blue portal), it will be the correct portal on the moon matching the one that's already on the ground. Because people couldn't think which was the right color in the moment. I know I definitely didn't remember which one I should be pressing lol.
        I remember hearing, probably in the commentary, that there are a few places that automatically switch the color of the last portal so that no matter which one you fire it's the right one. I think it's when you're in a funnel being projected into a portal.

And several of the long flings, if your speed is within a range it will adjust it to be exactly the right speed to make the landing.
I still remember how I felt when I saw the moon. Just sheer excitement about what was about to happen when I fired that portal.
    Truly one of the greatest moments in gaming. That shift from "oh wow, the moon" to "wait, what if--" to "HOLY SHIT THIS IS GODDAMNED EPIC" ... perfection.
        Yeah, that's one of my all-time gaming HOLY SHIT moments.  Really great.
    I wanted to say PORTALS ON THE MOON on my fb feed but I didn't wanna be a spoiler.
This was a really well written analysis of why the moon reveal is so poignant and why I have never met anyone that didn’t get the reveal.
Yeah, I see a lot of people say that the first was more challenging. But I breezed through most of those puzzles. The second was much harder for me when you get to the old section.
    Portal was a freebie with the Half-Life 2 set that had all the HL2 games. I remember finishing the last of HL2 well after midnight and thinking "well let's see what Portal is" and it was just the nicest dessert after the long slog that is HL2. No headcrabs, no moaning zombie corpses that throw headcrabs at you, just some puzzles and that lovely wit.

*Are you still there?*
        By dessert, you mean cake right?
    That's mostly because when you played the first game, you weren't used to thinking with portals yet. By the sequel, you've had some experience and have already familiarized yourself with the concept.

Still found 2 harder though.
There was gel puzzle or two that I still don't know if I did it right or if I just did it in a way that worked.
It's the tragedy of modern puzzle games where markers point out the answer. In the old Tomb Raider games you could spend ages on a tomb. Now it's a matter of looking for the white paint on the ledge and the glowing cliff face for you to climb. I think excesive play testing has killed challenging games.
I absolutely love the design of Old Aperture. All of the button illumination, checkboxes, and counters were Nixie tubes. And the test spheres have such a neat design to them.
What I don’t like about 2 is how self aware it feels. Like a lot of the old aperture puzzles feel like you just need to search the huge room for 10 minutes to find the one white spot to put the portal on and solve the puzzle, but it’s framed as you’re outside the testing chambers in the open so there should be more possibilities? Something about it doesn’t feel right to me. Also personally Wheatley got really old.
    Agreed - I loved the game and overall it was only a minor gripe for me, but the fact that it wasn't more "sandboxy" did take me out of the game a little bit.
    Well the portals only work on surfaces covered with moon dust iirc
        Yeah but it didn’t feel like you were exploring the world when there was always exactly one white panel exactly where you needed it. It makes the puzzles less satisfying, as opposed to 1 where for most puzzles you could put them almost anywhere but it wouldn’t accomplish anything if you didn’t have a plan
            You are making some very solid points that I didn't even notice. Loved the game but yeah you are right.
I completed the game in a single sitting. By the time I got to the old chambers I was getting real tired and taking so long to figure out the puzzles cause of it. But that only helped to make the atmosphere even mor emoody for me. So many good memories of this one.
I just checked mine. Although I still have it the total playtime has been reset to 5 hours, and I have so much more than that put into it.
    Yeah, my playtime on Half-Life got reset
This is starting to feel like the math classes I failed
I had no idea it was my cake day. Thanks!!
The cake is a lie!
Yeah but, cubed. The three 3 titles, dude was right, math nerds would love it lol, I do.
    Not sure why this is downvoted but people may be missing the logic - 3 by 3 by 3 would be a cube
No problem. It is a real mind fuck of a mod
It's huge though. I think it does a good job of showing the limits of the Portal concept/engine. By the end of Mel all the Portal'ing is spent in me and I'm ready for a break.   
Then in a year or two I go back and start all over at Portal 1
Commenting on a portal thread on cake day! Nice! Happy cake day!
    Pretty sure it was yesterday, but I'll take it! Playing Portal 1 right now too.
        Well depending on how far you've got a long... The cake is a lie.. Or is it.
imagine the people gel that was scraped in Portal 2 made a reappearance in vr
    You mean the gel that supposedly let you walk on walls?
According to the developers, this is the exact reason why they dropped a VR Portal in favor of Alyx
Sounds rather nauseating.  Those bits where you bounce up and down she does a little spin.
As someone who gets serious simulation sickness, I feel nauseated just thinking about it.
it's been 10 years. i wouldn't count on it anymore
Portal VR! Yay!

Oh wow. Master of Orion did this *twice*. Literally half the series is games made by a new team.
Metroid Prime
Well Portal 2, for one.
Wolpaw was contracted to help out with writing Alyx, so temporary returns are possible.
Kim Swift really downgraded there when it comes to integrity
    I'll bet he's making more money though
Just watched. Awesome. Can't wait to get home.
Valve actually wanted to continue making games for a long time, they just had their idea of a flat work structure, where devs could basically choose on whatever project they want to do, which led to devs starting a massive amount of projects, but then never finishing them when they encounter larger problems. They finally fixed it with Alyx since they needed a release to advertise the Valve index.



There is the visual book series of a valve Dec called final hours: "insert game" who in the newest installment, Half-Life: Alyx - Final Hours mentioned (IIRC) three different attempts on making a half life three since portal 2 came out, which all failed to be developed fully.
Oh. Play cool. Play cool. Here come the space cops. Here come the space cops.
    It's too big. Too big. Wanna go home. Wanna go to earth.
I was just going to say that. Since valve made that mod after all, I think its canon enough for me.
I’m a Lovage kinda guy myself
Okay look, we both said a lot of things that you’re going to regret
Well maybe you could make a portal that goes one second in the past, allowing you to clone things? Or one second in the future, allowing you to dodge otherwise undodgeable attacks?
    The thinking with time machine Portal 2 mod from forever ago is free on steam and adds this!
        there's another portal time mod??? ohno
            It’s been out since 2014, and it’s really challenging, fun, and free! [Here’s the steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286080/Thinking_with_Time_Machine/)
    What I mean to say is the "ideal" test becomes impossible- either the mechanics are so broken the solution is too simple, or the solution is so complex that no one but the creator can ever do it.
Haha. I was tired
Oh I definitely still own it. Just haven't played much of my 360 games ever since the XBone came out and then life started punching me in the face.

And yeah I just played through Halo 3 and felt the same way. Lots of edges everywhere that I don't remember.
It’s also not a bad “show don’t tell” type of scene. She starts reacting to a voice from her past and suddenly, she’s infantalized. She’s vulnerable. This ruthless AI wuvs her papa. It’s a great story-telling moment where she’s more human than AI. It makes the player empathize/sympathize with a computer.
Except I wasn’t laughing
    Under the circumstances I’ve been shockingly nice
4 hours later and I got to hear that sweet ending song, I forgot how good portal 2 was
What do you mean? It is a community made mod, so its not like its from valve but its a mod of portal. And yea I have now idea how it is, I just thought I would post as he mentioned a mod was already made.
    I know it’s just a mod, I’m saying the gameplay has nothing to do with portal. Aside from using the same assets to make it look visually the same, it has nothing to do with Portal.

In other words, if this game had different art and was released standalone, I would never think “damn this reminds me so much of portal!”
        Oh dam so there's no portals in it?
            Yep, for some reason someone thought that was a good idea
                Well thanks for clearing that up. Take it off my game list for when I finally get VR
                    No problem! 

No need to take it off though, it’s still entertaining for a while and since it’s super small (less than 30 minutes I think?) and free, you don’t lose anything trying it :) it’s just a bit frustrating to play because you’ll be thinking “damn, they had such a good opportunity to make portal in vr why did they do it this way?”
It was so good! I play through the game every once in a while just to hear "The Turret Concierto!"
Idk want you gone still gives me chills every time I hear it
    Yes. Want you gone and Still alive are so brilliant
    Unpopular opinion, i know.  But "Want You Gone" doesnt hit the same as "Still Alive."
I believe the developers said that Glados wasn't part of the original project, but that the test players felt the game needed an antagonist, so they added it
    This was also extremely early on in development
        Glados made the game.
            Agreed
            It really did. Even if they just had an announcer (and even a good one like Cave Johnson) the game would have lacked the soul it has now.
                Go  play the  addon mel  on steam  cave jonhson talk most of the time
            Actually, Valve did.
                Did you know the cake is a lie?
            Absolutely. Some dialogue interactions had me dieing laughing. Also I guess we can't really call it interactions because we never do respond to Glados, ever. So she is really talking to herself. Such a great game.
        The game ended up VERY different from how it started out :-) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narbacular_Drop

There’s actually a playable version of the original somewhere in the intertubes.
            The same school had another student game called "Tag:The Power of Paint" iirc. In it you had a gun that painted surfaces with different colors, which would change how that surface reacted to the player.

One color would make you run fast, anther would make you bounce off the surface, and a third would make you stick to it and rotate your perspective.

Valve hired that group of students and put the concept into Portal 2.
                Ah!  Cool to know. Digipen seems to have had some pretty good students.
            I remember playing this! I always said portal was a copy. I never remembered the name, and people doubted it's existence, but here it is!
            Was free way back. I played it at some point or another.
    the test players felt the game needed ~~an antagonist~~ a beacon of light
>cave Jonson actually being chells mom

CAVE JOHNSON IS HER MOM?
    My engineers tried telling me drinking moon rock gel would make me infertile.  To hell with them I say! Just to prove them wrong, I'll have my own damn kid,  and when I do it,  I'm going to be both the father and the mother! Let's get to some science.
        It's been 10 years, but I can still hear that man's voice in my head.
            I'm willing to bet it's been less than 10 years since you've heard JK Simmons' voice, though.
                The man is a freaking treasure. He seems to just really embrace the crazy in every part he plays.
            Me too, just now it has to do with insurance
            This is true! 😂
            Do you know who I am?

I'm the man whos gonna burn your house down!

With the lemons!
        Why does this make me feel it's more likely as opposed to less likely?
    Hey gang! Cave Johnson here! 

I'm just popping in to clear up some confusion. There have been some rumors that I have been engaging in relationships with Aperture employees that would be considered inappropriate for the workplace. Let me assure you, these rumors are absolutely false. There have also been rumors that I may or may not have sired certain children with certain people who may or may not have been my personal assistant, who I may or may not have arranged to be digitally copied to develop an AI to run the company once I finally succumb to this terrible illness that may or may not have been caused by powered moon rocks that I may or may not have also tried snorting one time in the 80's while trying to find new marketable applications for existing products. Let me assure you, that these rumors are absolutely true - but only under well defined probabilistic scenarios.

Let me explain. See, a few years back the boys in engineering started having trouble coming up with new ideas for products. We tried everything! We tried a portal gun with one entrance and two exits. We tried a new gel that makes literally anything it touches spontaneously combust. We even had a period where we considered getting back to our roots, so to speak, and making shower curtains again! Eventually we settled on the last idea we'd ever need, the Aperture Science Perpetual Testing Initiative. Now that we have access to the multiverse, we no longer need to come up with ideas, we can just steal them from some other version of ourselves! So what does this have to do with the rumors from earlier? Well, there are infinite multiverses, each with differences that could be minor, such as one guy having a minor corporate policy violation that's being blown way out of proportion by HR, or they could be significant changes affecting the entire human race. Case in point, the Cave Johnson addressing you right now is actually not human at all, but from a multiverse where everyone is actually a ferret. So you see, given the infinite variables between infinite multiverses, there is almost certainly one where the events being described have come to pass. But it's not this one! Nope! No sir! I give you my word. And it's like my father always told me, "Cave, a ferret that can't give you their word isn't a ferret, but a weasel." 

Anyway, I think that should clear up all of the confusion, so I won't bother talking about how you can contact me if you have anymore questions, since obviously there won't be any. 

Thanks,
-- Cave

Really? I just played through it again recently and I thought they were pretty clear about glados being her mother.
Wasn't Glados played by multiple actors?
    No, GLaDOS was voiced by a single person, Ellen McLain.
        I thought the singer from Faith No More voiced one of her personalities in Portal 2
            Nah, this is his starring role in the game 

https://youtu.be/HOhLgfQqg_g
    Damn just downvote this guy for being curious lol
        I found that a bit interesting.
        Proper reddit etiquette is to answer with words instead of downvotes!
True, but it's also canon that she's adopted. Cave Johnson and Caroline could well be her biological parents though.
    GLaDOS *says* she's adopted, but GLaDOS talks mad shit.
        Yes, but the context, both GLaDOS and Wheatley say she's adopted. GLaDOS could simply have denied it, but she didn't, in fact she confirmed it, and *sympathized* with Chell about it.
    Is it? I don't really fully trust whatever GLaDOS says.
        Both Wheatley and GLaDOS state it as fact, and at that point GLaDOS is on Chell's side.
            Oh, I didn't remember that.

Still, they didn't say *when* she was adopted, did they? She can be a worker's adopted daughter, no?
Doug Rattmann is the guy that wrote all the cake is a lie graffiti in the games. An old aperture science employee that survived glados killing everyone and went crazy living in the walls of the facility. 

They put out some comics called Ratman about Rattmann. I havent read them, so I can't tell you what happens in them. But seems like this person is saying Rattmann was chell's adopted parent? Raising her instead of Cave and Caroline? This is the first i'm hearing about it too. Not crazy about the idea.
    He was schizophrenic and ran out of meds.
There's a comic book (I believe it's just called "Ratman"), where in we see Doug Ratman, the man who left all of the messages behind the walls in both games (as he slowly went insane). In the comic, it's revealed that his daughter was taken at take your daughter to work day (the day Glados was turned on) into the test subject pool. I haven't read it myself but it's apparent in the comic that 1) his daughter isn't biologically his 2) he "adopted" her from a coworker 3) he's resentful toward Cave & Caroline through his career. Putting that together, it's pretty strongly implied that Chell is the abandoned daughter of Caroline and Cave who was raised by Ratman (also why Glados relentlessly calls you adopted).
    Ohhh GladOS is that cold.
    That's pretty far off into crazy fan-theory land, though, and I think you're just misremembering; the take you daughter to work day isn't in the comic at all, and the same comic has him bumping Chell up to #1 on the list of test subjects for Portal 1 because the reason she was originally rejected from testing altogether was that her "tenacity" score was off the charts. Nothing in the text states or implies he knows her at all, much less that she's his adopted kid- the companion cube asks how he knew about her and says "know what?" and it was "something in her file". He's not trying to save her at that point (he is trying to save her after she's recaptured at the end of Portal 1), he's just picking someone out of the files that can fight back.
        thank you for the clarification, I must be misremembering.
Here's an [in-game portrait](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/half-life/images/0/07/Cave_caroline_70s.png/revision/latest?cb=20120621160408&path-prefix=en) of the two of them. I wouldn't say she looks particularly asian.
    Clearly this image is quite off. Doesn't look anything like the teacher from Whiplash.
        But it kinda resembles that guy from that prison documentary
I am Asian
    I am Groot
"Chell is modeled after actress Alésia Glidewell, and appears to be of mixed-race white European and East or Southeast Asian background, with dark hair and blue eyes."

Source: https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Chell
    Wow that's interesting! Thanks.
        I went to college with her.
            Nice.
        No problem
\*sigh\* You are technically correct. The best kind of correct.
2.6 seconds is an eternity for a gamer
    More like 5 seconds for the round trip, assuming the gun works at the speed of light.
        But it only takes 1.3 to get to the moon and 1.3 for the light to come back.
            Huh, you're right. I've been off by a factor of 2 for years.
    Fuck I just laughed out loud on a bus with only one other person and they are looking at me like I am strange.
There's a sign in 2 that says something like: In case of reactor implosion, look directly at implosion. 

AFAIK they put that sign in because they worked hard on the animation of the implosion and play testers never saw it because they turned around to keep playing. Should've put up a sign like that on the moon.
I've heard somewhere they also programmed it so that no matter what button you choose (orange or blue portal), it will be the correct portal on the moon matching the one that's already on the ground. Because people couldn't think which was the right color in the moment. I know I definitely didn't remember which one I should be pressing lol.
    I remember hearing, probably in the commentary, that there are a few places that automatically switch the color of the last portal so that no matter which one you fire it's the right one. I think it's when you're in a funnel being projected into a portal.

And several of the long flings, if your speed is within a range it will adjust it to be exactly the right speed to make the landing.
Truly one of the greatest moments in gaming. That shift from "oh wow, the moon" to "wait, what if--" to "HOLY SHIT THIS IS GODDAMNED EPIC" ... perfection.
    Yeah, that's one of my all-time gaming HOLY SHIT moments.  Really great.

That's pretty far off into crazy fan-theory land, though, and I think you're just misremembering; the take you daughter to work day isn't in the comic at all, and the same comic has him bumping Chell up to #1 on the list of test subjects for Portal 1 because the reason she was originally rejected from testing altogether was that her "tenacity" score was off the charts. Nothing in the text states or implies he knows her at all, much less that she's his adopted kid- the companion cube asks how he knew about her and says "know what?" and it was "something in her file". He's not trying to save her at that point (he is trying to save her after she's recaptured at the end of Portal 1), he's just picking someone out of the files that can fight back.
    thank you for the clarification, I must be misremembering.
Clearly this image is quite off. Doesn't look anything like the teacher from Whiplash.
    But it kinda resembles that guy from that prison documentary
I am Groot
Wow that's interesting! Thanks.
    I went to college with her.
        Nice.
    No problem
More like 5 seconds for the round trip, assuming the gun works at the speed of light.
    But it only takes 1.3 to get to the moon and 1.3 for the light to come back.
        Huh, you're right. I've been off by a factor of 2 for years.
Fuck I just laughed out loud on a bus with only one other person and they are looking at me like I am strange.
I remember hearing, probably in the commentary, that there are a few places that automatically switch the color of the last portal so that no matter which one you fire it's the right one. I think it's when you're in a funnel being projected into a portal.

And several of the long flings, if your speed is within a range it will adjust it to be exactly the right speed to make the landing.
Yeah, that's one of my all-time gaming HOLY SHIT moments.  Really great.
By dessert, you mean cake right?
Yeah but it didn’t feel like you were exploring the world when there was always exactly one white panel exactly where you needed it. It makes the puzzles less satisfying, as opposed to 1 where for most puzzles you could put them almost anywhere but it wouldn’t accomplish anything if you didn’t have a plan
    You are making some very solid points that I didn't even notice. Loved the game but yeah you are right.
Well depending on how far you've got a long... The cake is a lie.. Or is it.
Touche
there's another portal time mod??? ohno
    It’s been out since 2014, and it’s really challenging, fun, and free! [Here’s the steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286080/Thinking_with_Time_Machine/)
Oh dam so there's no portals in it?
    Yep, for some reason someone thought that was a good idea
        Well thanks for clearing that up. Take it off my game list for when I finally get VR
            No problem! 

No need to take it off though, it’s still entertaining for a while and since it’s super small (less than 30 minutes I think?) and free, you don’t lose anything trying it :) it’s just a bit frustrating to play because you’ll be thinking “damn, they had such a good opportunity to make portal in vr why did they do it this way?”
Glados made the game.
    Agreed
    It really did. Even if they just had an announcer (and even a good one like Cave Johnson) the game would have lacked the soul it has now.
        Go  play the  addon mel  on steam  cave jonhson talk most of the time
    Actually, Valve did.
        Did you know the cake is a lie?
    Absolutely. Some dialogue interactions had me dieing laughing. Also I guess we can't really call it interactions because we never do respond to Glados, ever. So she is really talking to herself. Such a great game.
The game ended up VERY different from how it started out :-) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narbacular_Drop

There’s actually a playable version of the original somewhere in the intertubes.
    The same school had another student game called "Tag:The Power of Paint" iirc. In it you had a gun that painted surfaces with different colors, which would change how that surface reacted to the player.

One color would make you run fast, anther would make you bounce off the surface, and a third would make you stick to it and rotate your perspective.

Valve hired that group of students and put the concept into Portal 2.
        Ah!  Cool to know. Digipen seems to have had some pretty good students.
    I remember playing this! I always said portal was a copy. I never remembered the name, and people doubted it's existence, but here it is!
    Was free way back. I played it at some point or another.
It's been 10 years, but I can still hear that man's voice in my head.
    I'm willing to bet it's been less than 10 years since you've heard JK Simmons' voice, though.
        The man is a freaking treasure. He seems to just really embrace the crazy in every part he plays.
    Me too, just now it has to do with insurance
    This is true! 😂
    Do you know who I am?

I'm the man whos gonna burn your house down!

With the lemons!
Why does this make me feel it's more likely as opposed to less likely?
You are a delight

I thought the singer from Faith No More voiced one of her personalities in Portal 2
    Nah, this is his starring role in the game

I found that a bit interesting.
Proper reddit etiquette is to answer with words instead of downvotes!
Yes, but the context, both GLaDOS and Wheatley say she's adopted. GLaDOS could simply have denied it, but she didn't, in fact she confirmed it, and *sympathized* with Chell about it.
Both Wheatley and GLaDOS state it as fact, and at that point GLaDOS is on Chell's side.
    Oh, I didn't remember that.

Still, they didn't say *when* she was adopted, did they? She can be a worker's adopted daughter, no?
