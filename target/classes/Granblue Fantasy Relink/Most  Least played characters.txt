[[Most  Least played characters]]


What characters are the most and least played characters in your experience?

Most played is definitely Narmaya but that's no big surprise.
Any other characters you see all the time? I see lots of Ferry players.

Least played? I've done nearly 400 online hunts and not seen a single Ghandagoza player yet. Barely see Rose or Katalina players either, very rare.

Is there an official list of character usage anywhere? In any case, I am interested in your experiences!


I play Rosetta. 

I feel like I'm alone out there. 

In an ocean of Narmayas...
    Was a Rosetta but game wanted me to be Katalina (Terminus Drop and Double Sigil dropped). 

I still feel we are a rare but all these Katalina posts are making me think the Katalina hype is coming. :)
        She has invul and freeze, and afaik the only combination of those two effects.

I agree as we settle on good comps she'll be on the list
            Don't forget the AOE Stout. I think she is the only one who has access to this.
                I feel that's less important as it seems everyone can get stout in their kit.  

At least itnseems that way.
                    There is a sigil that grants stout, but since 5 sigil slots are always used up for damage cap and awakening, having a slot free isn't so bad.
        üòÇ
    Disappeared... among the sea of butterflies.
        HOLY HELL SEELE IS NARMAYA BUT SCYTHE HOW DID I NEVER SEE THIS BEFORE
        Reddit posts that you can hear
    I like rose in the story and when I get her weapon and stuff I plan on trying her out a bit more. She just seemed sort of like she would be awkward on some boss fights trying to just throw the roses around as they hop all over the place.

I could see her being really good during breaks or links though or on boss fights that have a very set pattern like proto.
    Played Rosetta until late in Proud. She just can't hold up vs super high mobility. And I wanted Vane anyway. And finally got his Awakening. But I repped her for 40 hours.
        That is not true at all, although she def needs understanding on how to deal against mobile enemies, she still ez MvP if you play her right. That is the reason why you don't see as many Rosettas, they play with her early and since she is pretty easy to play against weak and slow enemies, as soon as the difficult increase they drop her.
            Rose Tycoon being inconsistent makes her feel much worse. Because for no reason it will just self-target. Ruining any form of consistency she could buy.
                Yeah you're self targetting because you're aiming at Heads or Body Parts that moves a lot especially upwards, that what happens when you try to use Rose Tycoon against flying enemies, it'll self target.   
You want to use it against grounded body parts and aim at them 100% of the time to avoid this issue and not use against flying enemies.
                    ...Huh. I guess that makes sense. Thank you? Haha. I never specifically choose the head. I just accept whatever my first lock on sets. But it still feels like a crapshoot sometimes.
                        Yeah no problem, she is very underrated atm because people don't try to give her a bit more time to understand her kit so she could perform better.  And i gotta spread Rosetta awareness lol.
                            I do love her. But the worthlessness against fliers hurts. As does difficulty vs hyper mobile. Plus. I'm an unapologetic boykisser. So how am I supposed to say no to a literal Golden retriever? Haha. Maybe I'll build her as a secondary more. But the opposition there is the meme that is our favorite collateral damage.
                                To be fair a lot of the roster (Melee characters) has trouble against flying enemies unless you can pin then down with Freeze and Paralyze.  


LOL for sure she is a queen!
        If this game ever gets it as a sigil I think attack speed boost would be a killer effect for Rosetta, as a Rosetta main I feel most frustrated with how slow her attacks can be
            I feel most frustrated with planting flowers. Because it will hang up on any enemy. Even if not locked on. Makes it super tough to even try to place them near allies for defensive buffs.
                True true, the aim assist is a bit too aggressive, I agree
                    Also. The move to mass reposition flowers is so rough. Because it'll target me. Even if a boss is three feet away and locked onto them. I can't play her because she needs QoL so badly. And playing her feels so bad with those two issues.
                        Yes, I hope once we get closer to the big update windows we hear some good QoL, that issue in some fights where tycoon puts it at my feet drives me nuts
                        Plus the fact that you can't keep all 3 buffs at the same time sucks imo
                the defensive buffs the roses produce have a radius of around 7x the radius of the actual plant itself, you do not need to have them near allies in most arenas.
                    I thought the damage cut and the taunt did kinda? Not the regen or def up. But the other ones from skills.
                        damage cut will similarly be an extremely long range, [as you can see here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/g4qkvcpe7ufwhvi8f57lw/20240213144650_1.jpg?rlkey=ojiwzsxyth8lfnwdj8xysoflm&dl=0).

Mesmerise is not a defensive buff and only works if the boss is in the radius of the plant, as all offensive skills are.
                            Fair enough! I thought she needed them to be right on top of people. Good to know.
            No please, my hands are already dying with Lancelot, i cannot imagine doing hand exercises after every mission.
                I imagine then lance wouldnt want it lol but it was just a thought, like maybe it's different per attack so lance and other speedsters wouldn't need it
                    I mean more attack speed is the best dps increase you can have. Not to mention the synergy with cascade or similar functioning sigils.
            Atk spd boost on Percy would be broken beyond belief lmao
    hi rosetta player

katalina main here signing in o7 we stand togethe
        o7

Kat is actually a really fun character. I gotta find a guide for her because I am struggling to use her properly :D
            The discord server is a great place for resources if you need some :)
            i made a guide for her recently here on the subreddit o/ also like the other person said the discord is great
    on the flipside, whenever I'm paired with rosetta in a quick quest, I know it's really gonna be quick because rosetta mains are guaranteed hyper good at their craft
    I main Rosetta and I bed money if I'm no mvp every time. I despise narmaya for that same reason. Is just stupid to the constant any+3 narmaya group.
    Yeah, Narmaya is like longsword in mh: world.
        haha yeah, dem weebs
I see narmaya often but rarely see ghandagoza
Every time I play Rosetta I always seem to find the 20 other Rosetta players out there. If I am not playing Rosetta I never see them.

I have only seen like 3 Percivals online so far which I found surprising because half of youtube is like "WOW BIG DAMAGE LOOK AT THIS THUMBNAIL PERCIVAL TOP DPS". They do seem more common later in the game for some reason.

Io isn't very common either, especially on difficult fights. 

Charlottas are pretty common, and we all share a singular braincell. Boss starts doing crazy stuff, and we all just go, "I'm invincible!" and monkey our way through it. 4 Charlotta runs are optimal, and I refuse to hear anything to the contrary.

I am convinced Rackams only exist in Slimepede and at the Quest Complete chest where the dude I swear wasn't even in the party for the entire fight blows himself up.

Narmayas outnumber the population of Zegegrande by at least 10 to 1. Cags and Ferrys aren't far behind in my experience. I find at least 1 in most Quick Quest runs.

Kat is an NPC. Never see her, so that means she isn't playable, right? Hopefully, the devs add her to the crew someday.
    [deleted]
        yeah
    Do you even remember ghandagoza
        Me? Gongaga.
            What's so funny? You know Gongaga?
    My first Bahamut Versa attempt was a clear with 3 Charlottas and a Gran. I heard Gran say on link attack ‚ÄúI wanna be like her when I grow up.‚Äù
    Zeta above cag and ferry
    If i get enough funds to buy the game
I plan to play Rosetta too

Why is barely any videos,build of her?

Is she not that good? Or just okay?
Or a lot of players havent realize her potential etc.

Can you give a brief description of what she can do?
I just saw her trailer looks like she have a lot of AOE attack and support
        Because once you get to Proud she is not as free anymore, you need to me mindful on where you are targetting, most people aim at heads and they often makes the skills and roses get placed elsewhere since bosses moves their head upwards a lot so you always want to aim at their grounded parts, you also don't want to waste your reposition skills trying to chase an enemy that is moving a lot a mistake a lot of them do and blame the character. She is insanely strong on the right hands not underperform like some other characters.

But here is a quick build and guide:

Sigils: 1 Stamina V+, 4 Damage caps, 1-2 Crit depending on your overmastery and weapon stone, 3 Supp damage (doesnt work on Flowers passive damage but it does with her skills) War Elemental, Awakaned sigil and the rest is optional you can put whatever you want, Cascade, Uplift, Short Cooldon and Guts would be preferable to have as secondary passives in your sigils, you should be getting the flower damage cap as long as you have her atk buff up (33k without Glass cannon and 34k with it).

Skills: Tycoon, Spiral Rose are a must, they're your bread and butter.

\-Tycoon reposition your flowers and add a Poison to the enemy that does damage based on their max health (it doesnt work on infinite health mode of the target dummy, so you cant parse it well)

\-Spiral Rose is your biggest hitter, with a short cooldown, although Iron maiden doesnt say it, but Spiral Rose triggers Iron Maiden making it deal around 2m damage per use, great in 100% link time

\-Lost love is your nuke, it deals 3 ticks of almost 700k damage per hit without counting the Supp damage bonus, need you to set it up and has quite the long cooldown but its worth it.

\-Iron maiden, as explained before it has a gimmick that makes you deal a ton of damage, it has a long cooldown and short uptime so if you're not used on how to play against every boss you want to pick Bouquet to have less downtime.

\-Bouquet is your help button that you can replace Iron maiden with, if you're having trouble against mobile enemies, helps a lot with its Rose level up fixing some issues of lv1 flowers not hitting the enemy because of its range, it also helps to set up a pre-fire Lost Love without wasting Tycoon.

\-Rose Barrier is cool if you're playing support Rosetta and your teammates are dying a ton making you fail, 40% damage reduction coupled with her defense buff is insanely good.

She is very strong with her weakness being bad players against mobile enemies, but once you understand more of the game, she should be very easy and fun to use. Don't be locked to her though, she one of many fun to use characters here and while some underperform, there is no competition and everyone is viable to use.
            I see.. Ty for this great info
    Kat is playable.
bro I didn't choose Narmaya life, the Narmaya life chose me. I played Rackam all the way to Bahamut, and he dropped me a Narmaya weapon, then guess what I got at the sigil transmute?

The least played is definitely Rosetta. Haven't seen a single one. I've even seen Yoda and Ghandy once.
    I haven‚Äôt played a lot of online but I‚Äôve already seen 3 yodas. As many as Narmaya somehow.
Ghandagoza main checking in. There are a dozen(s) of us!(?)
    Funnily enough, Ghandagoza was the last character I unlocked and I regret waiting so long to unlock him. He instantly became my favorite character within the 1st hour of using him.
[deleted]
    I play Gran, who I never see because anyone who wants to play Captain would rather use Djeeta apparently.
    I love playing with Djeetas as Gran. Personally, I love the djeeta and gran SBA portrait. It's so cool having both captains burst together (since they are never really together in the mobile game; you can only be either gender after all). :D Captain supremacy!
    Lol üòÇ
[removed]
    every female doraf is like that tho
Least played is easily the two big beefy men
    Nah, I've seen a lot of Vaseragas.
    i do see charlotta and yoda sometimes tho
    Big bodies unpopular just like many fighting games
You will most often see IO, Rackam, and Eugen in 2 Griffins map or 2 Eyes ball map farming Fortitude L.

Narmaya is popular because of Vergil moveset, has crush on Captain and big booba. 

Zeta is hot

Charlotta button smash is popular

Kata is less popular due to how her combo and guage work. Rosetta is slow so same fate

Honestly I have never seen bad IO main.

Cag is somewhat popular because healing, simple combo X Y Y.

Percival is often more popular than Siegfried because charging gameplay is more simple than timing your hit. 

God bless Vane and Lancelot main, but I barely see them.

I saw Yoda a few time, but not that many times.

Ghada? I see Vase a few times, must be MH GS main.
    Yes Zeta is HOT
She is the only reason why i will buy/play this game
I only seen the anime so i have no clue about Grand Blue Fantasy
Might buy GB Versus when SALE to play Zeta
Most: Narmaya

&#x200B;

Least: Vas, Rosetta, Ghanda
It looks like everyone forgot about Siegfried üòÇ
    Do you see him often? He's rarely in my groups
        I see him a ton. The one I‚Äôve yet to see after 150 hours is Ghandagoza.
        I play both him and vane online constantly, they're all I see :'D

Jesus Christ it's lonely
    I see siegfried. But Jesus I hate the timing so much on the character
Most popular from my experience: Narmaya, Cagliostro, Ferry

Least: Ghandagoza, Vaseraga, Captain
Been experimenting with a few mains. Started as Lancelot but the button mashing had me swap to Vane. Now in leveling everyone to 100 and have enjoyed a few. Seig is cool but his dang combos are hard for my timing challenged brain. Percival I want to enjoy but he's sooooo simple. Zeta was super cool, but I'm not sold on her yet for some reason. Ferry was a weird melee range hybrid that I couldn't get used to. Id is so cool but I dislike his ability rotation. I'm kind of at a weird idk what I want to play stage üòÖ

I think my least time has been on Cag and Io. They're both just not my cup of tea art/character model wise.
Yoda is life. I haven't seen another yet.
    Mind giving me a run down on how to play him? Unlocked him but didn‚Äôt understand his gauge thingy
I've been playing as Id since I unlocked him

a lot of ppl were playing him too in the first few days but rn he's quite a rare sight
Judging by these comments I'll nax out Ghandi next once I get his weapon drop.
    Have you tried him?  


His kit is absolutely miserable.
        Good god, is he ever. He takes forever to get to the point of using his BIG PUNCH, while other Perfect Timing reliant characters can still get the meat of their damage done, not only faster, but also more reliably, and in Zeta's case, much safer.
            Yep, basically how I feel about him.

I played Sieg so I'm down with timing and such but good lord, he's visually boring and his whole kit is just "punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, big punch" with no mobility except shoulder charge.

He needs a little bit of spice. He's basically as exciting as boiled cabbage.
                Not gonna lie, I have a thing for characters that just punch real good, and I'm all for 'local Draph punches Primal into submission'. After all, Ghan's entire lore is that he just punches REALLY good, no magic or tomfoolery, to the point of being able to carve holes in mountains and even FLY, so Relink really did the 'Strongest Fists of All Time' dirty. For a martial artist, he really ought to be slightly faster and more mobile than, say, Big Raga.
                    Oh yeah, I was pumped when I saw a monk. That was my class when I played FF14. It's always my go too.
Then I saw his play and I was like, so it's just the most uninspiring stuff to watch and I have no interest in it.
        I play both Ghanda and sieg. Despite Ghanda having a stiff move set, he‚Äôs damn powerful. I would like his damage on Siegfried. Sieg dps is pathetic, if he wasn‚Äôt so damned fun I wouldn‚Äôt even look his way.
            Yeah Sieg is a bit lacking, no argument but he is fun.

Ghanda is just so dull to play.
                He would be infinitely more fun if his eternal rage built up tick by tick per perfect strike. That way you don‚Äôt have to LAND the combo finisher to get credit. Considering he has no other means besides counter and a long cooldown, long animation skill.
Never saw ghandagoza online. The scyth guy maybe twice, yoda once. The rest were lancelot, narmaya, ferry, zeta, parcival and a few siegfrieds/vanes here and there.
Working on my proud ghandagoza but I don't think I've seen one in the wild yet. 

Seen lots of Io and Narmaya though.
Rosetta Cagliostro Ferry are my mains.

Io is a secondary.

Vane was always getting added to the roster, but he skipped way ahead because I just got his weapon last night, my first one. I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing with him or what the optimal build/combos/skills are, but he‚Äôs so damn fun. And his personality is just so lovable. I love him so much.
    If i get enough funds to buy the game
I plan to play Rosetta too

Why is barely any videos,build of her?

Is she not that good? Or just okay?
Or a lot of players havent realize her potential etc.

Can you give a brief description of what she can do?
I just saw her trailer looks like she have a lot of AOE attack and support
        I‚Äôm far from a pro with her, but the gist is:

She‚Äôs based around setting her vines on the field and they attack on their own any enemy that‚Äôs in its AOE. They‚Äôre like turrets pretty much. The more they attack enemies, the more they level up which increases their AOE, their damage, and the effects of buffs she gives.

Those buffs she gives based off of which combo she uses. The combos are as stated (I‚Äôm playing on PS5 so these are the notations for me):

Combo 1: üü™ > Triangle (gives a defense buff for the entire party

Combo 2: üü™üü™ > Triangle (gives passive health regen to the party)

Combo 3: üü™üü™üü™ > Triangle (gives an ATK buff for the party)

Combo 4: üü™üü™üü™üü™ (I don‚Äôt believe gives anything)

Also her skills and abilities are also tied to her vines and their levels. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs bad at all. But she feels situational to me because she relies on having those vines set on her enemies, and a lot of these enemies move around a lot. So intend to pick her for certain bosses that don‚Äôt move as much. Maybe it‚Äôs not as much of a problem as I think and I‚Äôll realize it when I get better with her. But I definitely don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs bad. Most importantly, she‚Äôs soooo fun!
            Ty for great info
I see a lot of charlotta, Narmaya in proto bahamut
Right now I'm having fun with Vaseraga, it just satisfies my inner monhun spirit since I use GS there,and I sometimes switch to Sieg and Narmaya for variety. Least played rn is probably Kat, and others I haven't recruited yet.
My personal experience:

In every mission there will be one of these, if not 2: Narmaya, Rackam, Eugen, Siegfried, and Zeta.

Percival, Lancelot, Charlotta, Cagliostro, and Io are right behind.

Rarer but still common enough are Vasarega, Vane, the Captain, Ferry, Yodhara, and Spoiler. I probably see each of them about once every 4 or 5 missions.

I feel like I can go 20 missions without seeing a single Katalina, Rosetta, or Vasarega.

My main has maxed his terminus weapon and I've still never seen a Ghandagosa.
[deleted]
    I've not seen Yoda for so long I forgot he existed lol. Good catch!

I see Djeeta and Zeta more than Ghandy, Kat and Yoda at the end game hunts. Maybe mid-tier popularity?
        Depends on where you look tbh. Zeta is extremely common in proud mode. Arguably the most common. Almost impossible to play proto without seeing one.


Quick quest will always favor easier characters since the players are generally worse.
            [deleted]
                I think most players (including myself) are picking the hot/fun/cool characters rather than the meta ones. This isn't really a leaderboard or PVP game, so ppl are just picking the characters they want to play (as they should).
                    [deleted]
                        Yeah lol It's funny how ppl adopt this attitude and seek out top dps builds without the skill to properly use them when they're first-trying proud content. Thats how you get players running into the first proud boss and getting manually revived after the literal first hit cuz they're running tyranny and no defensive sigils (personal experience)
    I think I've never seen Ghandahoza in a coop!
    Oddly I feel like I see Yodarha more than Eugen and way more than Percival.
    Rosetta not even mentioned lmao
    Wow... couldn't even bothered to list Io.
    Man thought he was gonna slide vasegra name in and we won't notice lol
    > Zeta,

zeta main checking in.  she is a lot of fun, no idea why no one likes her.
I have used all (nearly all characters) and while rosetta was not controlled by me most of the time she is my next target of building her up on the long list but mark my words i wont play ghondaghoza ever! SLOW. CLUNKY. AND NOT WORTH THE HASSEL!!!
Yordarha most played.  several characters i haven‚Äôt even touched after i unlocked them, like not even doing mini tutorial lol
I've never seen heihachi played online lmao
    I guess people didn‚Äôt like your reference. I did!
I might try and main rose or kat. Both decent charachters. 

Need to practice with kat. Make sure her combos are down..
Yeah I know the tools I play all kinda get stout from their kit in one way or another. 

I know the stout can roll on double sigisl. But honestly.notnsure what level it.can get to that way..
 I've seen a lot of everyone during quick matches anyway. I was honestly surprised, Narmaya might be the most played character I've seen but just last night I couldn't stop running into Ghandagoza and Zeta for hours. Zeta might be up there at least in the top three characters I've seen the most personally since I've been doing quick matches. 

Least is probably Katalina or Rose I guess. But I have still seen them both at least a dozen times in the last hundred or so matches I've done trying to farm curios. 

It's funny though I've been trying to build up a Percival, Vane, and Vaseraga, and I never see more of them then when I play them. It's hilarious syncing with another Vane player and fighting over who gets to bubble first. Just this afternoon another Vaseraga and I were doing the same charge attack loops in sync on top of each other. Mirror matching always gets weird and goofy.
    Two vane bubbles is awesome for long bloodlusts multiboss fights
        I wish I could be that coordinated with randoms. Last time I met a Vane with bubble we ended up making a pair of boobies in the middle of the arena during the bloodlust phase haha.
I haven't even unlocked everyone yet so I cant give a least but I've been switching off between Katalina and Siegfried mostly.
Ghanda is not satisfying until you master his neutral game.
IO main here. Least played is Siegfried. Cant get a handle on him lol
I'm a Narmaya main myself.. out of all my runs I think Vaseraga, Ghandagoza, Kat and Rosetta are among the fewest I've quested with. But the rarest of them all is probably Siegfried..
Vaseraga doesn't get enough play
I was a Vane player‚Ä¶ until Bahamut choose to give me the Narmaya terminus weapon (after 30 runs)
So‚Ä¶ i became what i hated
    i got like 10+ terminus and still no Vane , but i enjoy 99k hp build tho , still cap dmg and facetank everything
Ghandagoza, Captain, Rose, Katalina.

i almost never see them.
I play katalina maybe seen a total of 7 in 100 hours of playing
From what I've experienced

most popular would be narmaya, cagliostro and percival

I've seen everyone else atleast 3 or 4 times but I've never ran into vaseraga, Rosetta or a fellow katalina main
Most I see is Narmaya, Cagliostro (I play her too) & Ferry.
Least is Katalina, Rosetta & Ghandagoza but when I do see them, they‚Äôre usually the best on the team.
i think ghandagoza , but havent seen one rosa in baha , and ghandagoza i havent seen one since i start to do pub
Apart from Narmayas, I see a lot of Id players lately. Which is funny because I main him too.
I have over 100h so far and never seen Ghanda on proud quest so far.. or anywhere else for that matter. Female Vergil on the other hand...
Haven't seen a single ghanda, also very rarely see katalina
Yoda main here. Every online party Ive been in usually has a Narmaya in it and if not her it's Rackam. But Rackam mains have better taste so I like seeing them way more.

I've seen exactly one Rosetta, one Ghandagoza and one Vaseraga. And you could tell the people playing them mained them because they blew the rest of us outta the park on Honors.
I‚Äôm a Rosetta main and I consistently top the charts as MVP between healing boost as secondary on sigils and the damage output with Aires out
Judging by my own experience, Narmaya is the most common I see, followed closely by Zeta and probably Lancelot. 

Least common seems to be Katalina and the big punchy dude nobody remembers the name of.
most played I've seen has to be Cagliostro and then Narmaya  
I've never seen a Ghandagoza nor a Vaseraga online  
everyone else I've seen at least once or twice
Was a Rosetta but game wanted me to be Katalina (Terminus Drop and Double Sigil dropped). 

I still feel we are a rare but all these Katalina posts are making me think the Katalina hype is coming. :)
    She has invul and freeze, and afaik the only combination of those two effects.

I agree as we settle on good comps she'll be on the list
        Don't forget the AOE Stout. I think she is the only one who has access to this.
            I feel that's less important as it seems everyone can get stout in their kit.  

At least itnseems that way.
                There is a sigil that grants stout, but since 5 sigil slots are always used up for damage cap and awakening, having a slot free isn't so bad.
    üòÇ
Disappeared... among the sea of butterflies.
    HOLY HELL SEELE IS NARMAYA BUT SCYTHE HOW DID I NEVER SEE THIS BEFORE
    Reddit posts that you can hear
I like rose in the story and when I get her weapon and stuff I plan on trying her out a bit more. She just seemed sort of like she would be awkward on some boss fights trying to just throw the roses around as they hop all over the place.

I could see her being really good during breaks or links though or on boss fights that have a very set pattern like proto.
Played Rosetta until late in Proud. She just can't hold up vs super high mobility. And I wanted Vane anyway. And finally got his Awakening. But I repped her for 40 hours.
    That is not true at all, although she def needs understanding on how to deal against mobile enemies, she still ez MvP if you play her right. That is the reason why you don't see as many Rosettas, they play with her early and since she is pretty easy to play against weak and slow enemies, as soon as the difficult increase they drop her.
        Rose Tycoon being inconsistent makes her feel much worse. Because for no reason it will just self-target. Ruining any form of consistency she could buy.
            Yeah you're self targetting because you're aiming at Heads or Body Parts that moves a lot especially upwards, that what happens when you try to use Rose Tycoon against flying enemies, it'll self target.   
You want to use it against grounded body parts and aim at them 100% of the time to avoid this issue and not use against flying enemies.
                ...Huh. I guess that makes sense. Thank you? Haha. I never specifically choose the head. I just accept whatever my first lock on sets. But it still feels like a crapshoot sometimes.
                    Yeah no problem, she is very underrated atm because people don't try to give her a bit more time to understand her kit so she could perform better.  And i gotta spread Rosetta awareness lol.
                        I do love her. But the worthlessness against fliers hurts. As does difficulty vs hyper mobile. Plus. I'm an unapologetic boykisser. So how am I supposed to say no to a literal Golden retriever? Haha. Maybe I'll build her as a secondary more. But the opposition there is the meme that is our favorite collateral damage.
                            To be fair a lot of the roster (Melee characters) has trouble against flying enemies unless you can pin then down with Freeze and Paralyze.  


LOL for sure she is a queen!
    If this game ever gets it as a sigil I think attack speed boost would be a killer effect for Rosetta, as a Rosetta main I feel most frustrated with how slow her attacks can be
        I feel most frustrated with planting flowers. Because it will hang up on any enemy. Even if not locked on. Makes it super tough to even try to place them near allies for defensive buffs.
            True true, the aim assist is a bit too aggressive, I agree
                Also. The move to mass reposition flowers is so rough. Because it'll target me. Even if a boss is three feet away and locked onto them. I can't play her because she needs QoL so badly. And playing her feels so bad with those two issues.
                    Yes, I hope once we get closer to the big update windows we hear some good QoL, that issue in some fights where tycoon puts it at my feet drives me nuts
                    Plus the fact that you can't keep all 3 buffs at the same time sucks imo
            the defensive buffs the roses produce have a radius of around 7x the radius of the actual plant itself, you do not need to have them near allies in most arenas.
                I thought the damage cut and the taunt did kinda? Not the regen or def up. But the other ones from skills.
                    damage cut will similarly be an extremely long range, [as you can see here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/g4qkvcpe7ufwhvi8f57lw/20240213144650_1.jpg?rlkey=ojiwzsxyth8lfnwdj8xysoflm&dl=0).

Mesmerise is not a defensive buff and only works if the boss is in the radius of the plant, as all offensive skills are.
                        Fair enough! I thought she needed them to be right on top of people. Good to know.
        No please, my hands are already dying with Lancelot, i cannot imagine doing hand exercises after every mission.
            I imagine then lance wouldnt want it lol but it was just a thought, like maybe it's different per attack so lance and other speedsters wouldn't need it
                I mean more attack speed is the best dps increase you can have. Not to mention the synergy with cascade or similar functioning sigils.
        Atk spd boost on Percy would be broken beyond belief lmao
hi rosetta player

katalina main here signing in o7 we stand togethe
    o7

Kat is actually a really fun character. I gotta find a guide for her because I am struggling to use her properly :D
        The discord server is a great place for resources if you need some :)
        i made a guide for her recently here on the subreddit o/ also like the other person said the discord is great
on the flipside, whenever I'm paired with rosetta in a quick quest, I know it's really gonna be quick because rosetta mains are guaranteed hyper good at their craft
I main Rosetta and I bed money if I'm no mvp every time. I despise narmaya for that same reason. Is just stupid to the constant any+3 narmaya group.
Yeah, Narmaya is like longsword in mh: world.
    haha yeah, dem weebs
[deleted]
    yeah
Do you even remember ghandagoza
    Me? Gongaga.
        What's so funny? You know Gongaga?
My first Bahamut Versa attempt was a clear with 3 Charlottas and a Gran. I heard Gran say on link attack ‚ÄúI wanna be like her when I grow up.‚Äù
Zeta above cag and ferry
If i get enough funds to buy the game
I plan to play Rosetta too

Why is barely any videos,build of her?

Is she not that good? Or just okay?
Or a lot of players havent realize her potential etc.

Can you give a brief description of what she can do?
I just saw her trailer looks like she have a lot of AOE attack and support
    Because once you get to Proud she is not as free anymore, you need to me mindful on where you are targetting, most people aim at heads and they often makes the skills and roses get placed elsewhere since bosses moves their head upwards a lot so you always want to aim at their grounded parts, you also don't want to waste your reposition skills trying to chase an enemy that is moving a lot a mistake a lot of them do and blame the character. She is insanely strong on the right hands not underperform like some other characters.

But here is a quick build and guide:

Sigils: 1 Stamina V+, 4 Damage caps, 1-2 Crit depending on your overmastery and weapon stone, 3 Supp damage (doesnt work on Flowers passive damage but it does with her skills) War Elemental, Awakaned sigil and the rest is optional you can put whatever you want, Cascade, Uplift, Short Cooldon and Guts would be preferable to have as secondary passives in your sigils, you should be getting the flower damage cap as long as you have her atk buff up (33k without Glass cannon and 34k with it).

Skills: Tycoon, Spiral Rose are a must, they're your bread and butter.

\-Tycoon reposition your flowers and add a Poison to the enemy that does damage based on their max health (it doesnt work on infinite health mode of the target dummy, so you cant parse it well)

\-Spiral Rose is your biggest hitter, with a short cooldown, although Iron maiden doesnt say it, but Spiral Rose triggers Iron Maiden making it deal around 2m damage per use, great in 100% link time

\-Lost love is your nuke, it deals 3 ticks of almost 700k damage per hit without counting the Supp damage bonus, need you to set it up and has quite the long cooldown but its worth it.

\-Iron maiden, as explained before it has a gimmick that makes you deal a ton of damage, it has a long cooldown and short uptime so if you're not used on how to play against every boss you want to pick Bouquet to have less downtime.

\-Bouquet is your help button that you can replace Iron maiden with, if you're having trouble against mobile enemies, helps a lot with its Rose level up fixing some issues of lv1 flowers not hitting the enemy because of its range, it also helps to set up a pre-fire Lost Love without wasting Tycoon.

\-Rose Barrier is cool if you're playing support Rosetta and your teammates are dying a ton making you fail, 40% damage reduction coupled with her defense buff is insanely good.

She is very strong with her weakness being bad players against mobile enemies, but once you understand more of the game, she should be very easy and fun to use. Don't be locked to her though, she one of many fun to use characters here and while some underperform, there is no competition and everyone is viable to use.
        I see.. Ty for this great info
Kat is playable.
I haven‚Äôt played a lot of online but I‚Äôve already seen 3 yodas. As many as Narmaya somehow.
Funnily enough, Ghandagoza was the last character I unlocked and I regret waiting so long to unlock him. He instantly became my favorite character within the 1st hour of using him.
I play Gran, who I never see because anyone who wants to play Captain would rather use Djeeta apparently.
I love playing with Djeetas as Gran. Personally, I love the djeeta and gran SBA portrait. It's so cool having both captains burst together (since they are never really together in the mobile game; you can only be either gender after all). :D Captain supremacy!
Lol üòÇ
every female doraf is like that tho
Nah, I've seen a lot of Vaseragas.
i do see charlotta and yoda sometimes tho
Big bodies unpopular just like many fighting games
Yes Zeta is HOT
She is the only reason why i will buy/play this game
I only seen the anime so i have no clue about Grand Blue Fantasy
Might buy GB Versus when SALE to play Zeta
Do you see him often? He's rarely in my groups
    I see him a ton. The one I‚Äôve yet to see after 150 hours is Ghandagoza.
    I play both him and vane online constantly, they're all I see :'D

Jesus Christ it's lonely
I see siegfried. But Jesus I hate the timing so much on the character
Mind giving me a run down on how to play him? Unlocked him but didn‚Äôt understand his gauge thingy
Have you tried him?  


His kit is absolutely miserable.
    Good god, is he ever. He takes forever to get to the point of using his BIG PUNCH, while other Perfect Timing reliant characters can still get the meat of their damage done, not only faster, but also more reliably, and in Zeta's case, much safer.
        Yep, basically how I feel about him.

I played Sieg so I'm down with timing and such but good lord, he's visually boring and his whole kit is just "punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, big punch" with no mobility except shoulder charge.

He needs a little bit of spice. He's basically as exciting as boiled cabbage.
            Not gonna lie, I have a thing for characters that just punch real good, and I'm all for 'local Draph punches Primal into submission'. After all, Ghan's entire lore is that he just punches REALLY good, no magic or tomfoolery, to the point of being able to carve holes in mountains and even FLY, so Relink really did the 'Strongest Fists of All Time' dirty. For a martial artist, he really ought to be slightly faster and more mobile than, say, Big Raga.
                Oh yeah, I was pumped when I saw a monk. That was my class when I played FF14. It's always my go too.
Then I saw his play and I was like, so it's just the most uninspiring stuff to watch and I have no interest in it.
    I play both Ghanda and sieg. Despite Ghanda having a stiff move set, he‚Äôs damn powerful. I would like his damage on Siegfried. Sieg dps is pathetic, if he wasn‚Äôt so damned fun I wouldn‚Äôt even look his way.
        Yeah Sieg is a bit lacking, no argument but he is fun.

Ghanda is just so dull to play.
            He would be infinitely more fun if his eternal rage built up tick by tick per perfect strike. That way you don‚Äôt have to LAND the combo finisher to get credit. Considering he has no other means besides counter and a long cooldown, long animation skill.
If i get enough funds to buy the game
I plan to play Rosetta too

Why is barely any videos,build of her?

Is she not that good? Or just okay?
Or a lot of players havent realize her potential etc.

Can you give a brief description of what she can do?
I just saw her trailer looks like she have a lot of AOE attack and support
    I‚Äôm far from a pro with her, but the gist is:

She‚Äôs based around setting her vines on the field and they attack on their own any enemy that‚Äôs in its AOE. They‚Äôre like turrets pretty much. The more they attack enemies, the more they level up which increases their AOE, their damage, and the effects of buffs she gives.

Those buffs she gives based off of which combo she uses. The combos are as stated (I‚Äôm playing on PS5 so these are the notations for me):

Combo 1: üü™ > Triangle (gives a defense buff for the entire party

Combo 2: üü™üü™ > Triangle (gives passive health regen to the party)

Combo 3: üü™üü™üü™ > Triangle (gives an ATK buff for the party)

Combo 4: üü™üü™üü™üü™ (I don‚Äôt believe gives anything)

Also her skills and abilities are also tied to her vines and their levels. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs bad at all. But she feels situational to me because she relies on having those vines set on her enemies, and a lot of these enemies move around a lot. So intend to pick her for certain bosses that don‚Äôt move as much. Maybe it‚Äôs not as much of a problem as I think and I‚Äôll realize it when I get better with her. But I definitely don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs bad. Most importantly, she‚Äôs soooo fun!
        Ty for great info
I've not seen Yoda for so long I forgot he existed lol. Good catch!

I see Djeeta and Zeta more than Ghandy, Kat and Yoda at the end game hunts. Maybe mid-tier popularity?
    Depends on where you look tbh. Zeta is extremely common in proud mode. Arguably the most common. Almost impossible to play proto without seeing one.


Quick quest will always favor easier characters since the players are generally worse.
        [deleted]
            I think most players (including myself) are picking the hot/fun/cool characters rather than the meta ones. This isn't really a leaderboard or PVP game, so ppl are just picking the characters they want to play (as they should).
                [deleted]
                    Yeah lol It's funny how ppl adopt this attitude and seek out top dps builds without the skill to properly use them when they're first-trying proud content. Thats how you get players running into the first proud boss and getting manually revived after the literal first hit cuz they're running tyranny and no defensive sigils (personal experience)
I think I've never seen Ghandahoza in a coop!
Oddly I feel like I see Yodarha more than Eugen and way more than Percival.
Rosetta not even mentioned lmao
Wow... couldn't even bothered to list Io.
Man thought he was gonna slide vasegra name in and we won't notice lol
> Zeta,

zeta main checking in.  she is a lot of fun, no idea why no one likes her.
I guess people didn‚Äôt like your reference. I did!
Two vane bubbles is awesome for long bloodlusts multiboss fights
    I wish I could be that coordinated with randoms. Last time I met a Vane with bubble we ended up making a pair of boobies in the middle of the arena during the bloodlust phase haha.
i got like 10+ terminus and still no Vane , but i enjoy 99k hp build tho , still cap dmg and facetank everything
She has invul and freeze, and afaik the only combination of those two effects.

I agree as we settle on good comps she'll be on the list
    Don't forget the AOE Stout. I think she is the only one who has access to this.
        I feel that's less important as it seems everyone can get stout in their kit.  

At least itnseems that way.
            There is a sigil that grants stout, but since 5 sigil slots are always used up for damage cap and awakening, having a slot free isn't so bad.
üòÇ
HOLY HELL SEELE IS NARMAYA BUT SCYTHE HOW DID I NEVER SEE THIS BEFORE
Reddit posts that you can hear
That is not true at all, although she def needs understanding on how to deal against mobile enemies, she still ez MvP if you play her right. That is the reason why you don't see as many Rosettas, they play with her early and since she is pretty easy to play against weak and slow enemies, as soon as the difficult increase they drop her.
    Rose Tycoon being inconsistent makes her feel much worse. Because for no reason it will just self-target. Ruining any form of consistency she could buy.
        Yeah you're self targetting because you're aiming at Heads or Body Parts that moves a lot especially upwards, that what happens when you try to use Rose Tycoon against flying enemies, it'll self target.   
You want to use it against grounded body parts and aim at them 100% of the time to avoid this issue and not use against flying enemies.
            ...Huh. I guess that makes sense. Thank you? Haha. I never specifically choose the head. I just accept whatever my first lock on sets. But it still feels like a crapshoot sometimes.
                Yeah no problem, she is very underrated atm because people don't try to give her a bit more time to understand her kit so she could perform better.  And i gotta spread Rosetta awareness lol.
                    I do love her. But the worthlessness against fliers hurts. As does difficulty vs hyper mobile. Plus. I'm an unapologetic boykisser. So how am I supposed to say no to a literal Golden retriever? Haha. Maybe I'll build her as a secondary more. But the opposition there is the meme that is our favorite collateral damage.
                        To be fair a lot of the roster (Melee characters) has trouble against flying enemies unless you can pin then down with Freeze and Paralyze.

            I mean more attack speed is the best dps increase you can have. Not to mention the synergy with cascade or similar functioning sigils.

                Fair enough! I thought she needed them to be right on top of people. Good to know.
No please, my hands are already dying with Lancelot, i cannot imagine doing hand exercises after every mission.
    I imagine then lance wouldnt want it lol but it was just a thought, like maybe it's different per attack so lance and other speedsters wouldn't need it
        I mean more attack speed is the best dps increase you can have. Not to mention the synergy with cascade or similar functioning sigils.
Atk spd boost on Percy would be broken beyond belief lmao
The discord server is a great place for resources if you need some :)
i made a guide for her recently here on the subreddit o/ also like the other person said the discord is great
What's so funny? You know Gongaga?
I see.. Ty for this great info
Yep, basically how I feel about him.

I played Sieg so I'm down with timing and such but good lord, he's visually boring and his whole kit is just "punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, big punch" with no mobility except shoulder charge.

He needs a little bit of spice. He's basically as exciting as boiled cabbage.
    Not gonna lie, I have a thing for characters that just punch real good, and I'm all for 'local Draph punches Primal into submission'. After all, Ghan's entire lore is that he just punches REALLY good, no magic or tomfoolery, to the point of being able to carve holes in mountains and even FLY, so Relink really did the 'Strongest Fists of All Time' dirty. For a martial artist, he really ought to be slightly faster and more mobile than, say, Big Raga.
        Oh yeah, I was pumped when I saw a monk. That was my class when I played FF14. It's always my go too.
Then I saw his play and I was like, so it's just the most uninspiring stuff to watch and I have no interest in it.
Yeah Sieg is a bit lacking, no argument but he is fun.

Ghanda is just so dull to play.
    He would be infinitely more fun if his eternal rage built up tick by tick per perfect strike. That way you don‚Äôt have to LAND the combo finisher to get credit. Considering he has no other means besides counter and a long cooldown, long animation skill.

    I think most players (including myself) are picking the hot/fun/cool characters rather than the meta ones. This isn't really a leaderboard or PVP game, so ppl are just picking the characters they want to play (as they should).

            Yeah lol It's funny how ppl adopt this attitude and seek out top dps builds without the skill to properly use them when they're first-trying proud content. Thats how you get players running into the first proud boss and getting manually revived after the literal first hit cuz they're running tyranny and no defensive sigils (personal experience)
I feel that's less important as it seems everyone can get stout in their kit.  

At least itnseems that way.
    There is a sigil that grants stout, but since 5 sigil slots are always used up for damage cap and awakening, having a slot free isn't so bad.
Yeah you're self targetting because you're aiming at Heads or Body Parts that moves a lot especially upwards, that what happens when you try to use Rose Tycoon against flying enemies, it'll self target.   
You want to use it against grounded body parts and aim at them 100% of the time to avoid this issue and not use against flying enemies.
    ...Huh. I guess that makes sense. Thank you? Haha. I never specifically choose the head. I just accept whatever my first lock on sets. But it still feels like a crapshoot sometimes.
        Yeah no problem, she is very underrated atm because people don't try to give her a bit more time to understand her kit so she could perform better.  And i gotta spread Rosetta awareness lol.
            I do love her. But the worthlessness against fliers hurts. As does difficulty vs hyper mobile. Plus. I'm an unapologetic boykisser. So how am I supposed to say no to a literal Golden retriever? Haha. Maybe I'll build her as a secondary more. But the opposition there is the meme that is our favorite collateral damage.
                To be fair a lot of the roster (Melee characters) has trouble against flying enemies unless you can pin then down with Freeze and Paralyze.  


LOL for sure she is a queen!
True true, the aim assist is a bit too aggressive, I agree
    Also. The move to mass reposition flowers is so rough. Because it'll target me. Even if a boss is three feet away and locked onto them. I can't play her because she needs QoL so badly. And playing her feels so bad with those two issues.
        Yes, I hope once we get closer to the big update windows we hear some good QoL, that issue in some fights where tycoon puts it at my feet drives me nuts
        Plus the fact that you can't keep all 3 buffs at the same time sucks imo
the defensive buffs the roses produce have a radius of around 7x the radius of the actual plant itself, you do not need to have them near allies in most arenas.
    I thought the damage cut and the taunt did kinda? Not the regen or def up. But the other ones from skills.
        damage cut will similarly be an extremely long range, [as you can see here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/g4qkvcpe7ufwhvi8f57lw/20240213144650_1.jpg?rlkey=ojiwzsxyth8lfnwdj8xysoflm&dl=0).
