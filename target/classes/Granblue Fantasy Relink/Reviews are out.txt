Well you have people like VG247 giving a 60(3/5) because it will make people go play a gacha game and they are exploitative...
    I thought that was such a weird take. It gave me an urge to go watch the anime, but that's about it. Maybe checking out the free option for Versus Rising. 


Guess they played the story and said "oh they put likable characters to get me to go pay for them in a different game" rather than realizing there's other ways to get the story outside of gacha. 
    What a take LOL. Take it from someone who really really wanted to be able to get into GBF. This game will get 1% to actually play GBF and stick through
        Yeah even people who would enjoy grinding in this game are likely to bounce off of GBF. That game is like a drug for a specific type of person.

I think Cygames wants to expand the ip and dive into other genres. And this game was a great chance to put the Dragalia Lost team to work.
            I just realized where the whole raid boss thing came from. Damn I miss dragalia lost. The bosses were always fun to tackle with players.
                Yeah I think its fun watching people go "woah these are designed like FFXIV boss fights" cause like they are, but you'd already know Cygames is putting out these kinds of games if you fought high midgardsormr, high mercury, and co when they were current !

They were insane for ever dropping that on mobile. If Dragalia released on console like this I would still be playing right now.
                    Oh I would be happy with a single player dragalia and just make the multiplayer peer to peer. I just wanna listen to the Japanese pop while killing big ass dragons and some.
                    Granblue always kind of felt like it was riffing on FF14 (and 11) though in myriad ways. The game released and was being actively updated during 2.0 release window and it kind of shows considering the initial premise ends up being 1:1 with it
                        This isn't surprising considering Cygames was founded by people who were originally apart of Square. The devs of GBF worked on Final Fantasy games before they founded cygames.

The spirit of FF games can be found all throughout the games. Hell some of the boss themes are even composed by Uematsu.
            There’s a lot of people doomsaying about Elder Scrolls VI, but I’d anticipate this reviewer (if they still have a job by that time) making the same argument. “Well it’s the same franchise so it’ll make you go play ESO and buy crown crown crates!”

Sounds like they just didn’t like the game much and wanted a better reason to give it a lower score than just “I didn’t like it”, so made an argument that makes no sense.
            Ohhh, I kinda felt like this game was like Dragalia Lost. I played that game for a bit and kept saying to myself. I wish I they’d just had released this as a regular non gacha game.
            100% this, I fucking love this game, and I like some of the characters, but I don’t give a single fuck about other GBF media. Might watch the anime though.
    Imagine considering yourself a journalist with a take like that. 

It's like saying "I give this Volkswagen a 3/5 even though it's great because it's German and I don't like Nazis."

What utter garbage.
    She's full of virtue signalling.
    This is extremely stupid, not just for the take, but also because Granblue shits out free pulls (I know years ago it did) constantly, back to back, almost nonstop. I don't recall anyone ever, even haters, stating "the game is greedy and wants you to gacha". Hell, the only complain I ever see for the source is that it's grindy to the point of being a full time job (and even cost some people theirs with poor time management).
        It still does that, yes, but in fairness: Once you start getting into it, a LOT of the "general pool" SSRs are second rate while most of the powerful, key pieces in any endgame team are limited (seasonal, flashfest, or legfest). But that's only a very small part of the overall experience, grinding will get you 99% of the way anywhere.
            I should note while good chars are indeed in flash and leg, the last year or so they have shifted to more powerful chars in the general pool. There's actually a number of chars in the general pool that are meta in their niche now.
                There's always been *some* strong units in the general pool (starting back when gandalf and yoda were meta), yes.
    Lmao Ive played mobage GBF since day one and not even spend a dime. That game itself is hella generous with crystals lol
        You aren't even encouraged to spend. Everyone says to save for 6% banners.
    Wait what? As someone who plays a couple of Gacha I fail to see how Granvlue is lead to that.
    I'm gonna be honest I didnt know Granblue had a gacha until I read that review. All I knew about Granblue is that it has an anime and a 2d fighting game. Got no clue where bud was going with that take.
        Today I learned there was an anime. Just thought it was the gacha, fighters, and this.
    Honestly, while I think it's important to keep gbf's origins close to the conversation at all times, I think it's a better idea to just say "If you're curious about the gacha, play this and VS only because gacha are awful for you". Still, I'd rather people veer on the side of caution when it comes to the topic of gacha tbh so I honestly can't blame him.
    Can you not just say a review is bad because it didn't give a good score
        the review gave a bad score because it doesn't like an entirely other game, that is a bad review.
    Bro should have just stated from the beginning that nothing the game did would get it a good score from him then lol
    I feel that’s a bit disingenuous of their issue with the game.

Their issue was the story was short and largely forgettable. Side quests were bland. And there wasn’t much exploration. The game was good but not amazing in anything it did. A fun game that felt like an advertisement for their mobile game.
    Relink and Versus rising did make me go back to the gacha after 6-7 years yes
[deleted]
    Indeed. They did shock me with saying that they have 100 hours on the game even tho it’s been out for not even 100 hours😭
lol @ the 55 score one...
    "generic"

FFXVI - 100
        FF16 is infinitely less generic than Grandblue. Also it told a complete story. 

Grandblue is pretty much "yeah itll continue at some point lol".

I'm not surprised tho, they update the story of the gacha twice per year.
            Less generic in terms of story maybe.. But in terms of an rpg game is 2/10 compared to Granblue. In terms of post game content again  is a 2/10. Combat wise i think they are even. Games must be reviewed for the whole package they offer not only story and while i enjoy heavy story driven games like FF16, I think i was watching more like a movie than actually playin an rpg game.
            Ff16 is just a copy paste of ff4 the after years, so that made it generic for me.
    How much did they give Suicide Squad?
        No reviews yet but that game will likely get pretty bad reviews by the looks of it.
        Hehe maybe 2/10-6/10.
I was expecting low 80s at its best anyway. It checks all the boxes for me, ultimately that is most important.
    People acting like high 70s to.low 80s is a bad game its just not goty material its still a 7 to.8 out of 10 that's very good. For some it'll be great
        Averaged out its basically a unanimous 8/10, so that's great on the scale. There are plenty of games in that range (or lower) that are worthwhile. Neo: TWEWY was my favourite game of 2021 sitting at a 80 avg, I loved Gravity Rush 2, heck I liked Stranger of Paradise and Valkyrie Elysium a lot and they scored way lower. 8/10 is good regardless, but at the end of the day, if the game speaks to you subjectively, the score doesn't matter all that much.
        I don’t trust people who aren’t invested with a game like this. Someone coming in with zero knowledge of Granblue is not going to have the same consensus as someone who has played the gacha, Versus, watched the anime etc. Lots of people praised Starfield before it came out, then realized over time it was hot garbage. I would be more inclined to trust a review from a pure JPRG streamer/reviewer over most game review sites.
        FFXI got only a 76% on my game magazin in 2003 but was a realy good MMORPGs for Final Fantasy Fans and its still alive. I dont care about %.
    I never expected this game to be GOTY level. I expect that from FF7 Rebirth. I just wanted this game to be fun to do raids with my boiz. It got many of us into the series
Around an 80 is what I would have guessed from critics. 

Only played a few hours and to me it’s personally higher (8.5-9), but I certainly will not scoff at an average of 8/10.

[Update: 82 with 59 reviews.](https://opencritic.com/game/16192/granblue-fantasy-relink)

That’s GBVS Rising with an 83 and Relink with an 82, congrats Cygames!
    Y’all really need to read the content of the reviews rather than obsessing over the scores:

“Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a fantastic game with a compelling story, excellent graphics and sound presentation, and one of the most complex yet entertaining gameplay experiences in the world of video games.”

- AltChar

“Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a fantastic anime adventure, and one that will delight fans of the series.”

“Excellent on a technical level, courageous in its approach and exemplary in terms of gameplay, Granblue Fantasy: Relink becomes a fantastic benchmark of the genre on its own merits.”

- IGN Spain

“Granblue Fantasy: Relink is not only a gorgeous game, the combat is satisfying with plenty of experimentation when it comes to your party.”

- God is a Geek

“Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a masterpiece and is an amazing entry point into the world of Granblue Fantasy.”

- The Outerhaven Productions

“Granblue Fantasy: Relink is an exceptional game that captures the essence of the series wonderfully. With tons of characters to play and a hearty endgame to dive into, Granblue Fantasy: Relink will have you coming back for more.”

- TechRaptor

“If there's one thing that can sum up our adoration for Granblue Fantasy: Relink, it's that Cygames has made the long wait absolutely worth it. The game feels like a product that was delivered with love and care for the franchise, highly evident in its stunningly gorgeous visuals and equally mesmerizing audio.”

- One More Game

“Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a triumph and one of the most mechanically deep and rewarding action-RPGs in recent memory. It’s easy to pick up, yet difficult to master combat feels great in motion, and it’s all in service of a world and cast of characters that are more than worthy of your time and attention.”

- Hey Poor Player

“Granblue Fantasy: Relink is undoubtedly a love letter to the series.”

- Prima Games

Enjoy the game!
        In fairness: The vast majority of people vaguely interested in the game will look at aggregate scores first and then MAYBE read a review or two. Anyone invested in doing more than that was probably planning to buy the game already and is just looking for reinforcement.
            The vast majority of gamers actually don't look at anything on the internet at all. They just buy games that seem fun and play them. That's why Ubisoft games sell so well. While the internet spends its time whining, arguing about the "formula", repetition, etc, millions of people just go and buy yet another AC game because the cover looked cool. Or the banner on Playstation store screen looked cool. Or a friend wanted to play co-op with them.

Scores are important to a group of gamers, but I genuinely don't think that group is very large. Games don't really fail because of underwhelming scores. They fail for a bunch of other reasons that might also coincidentally lead to those scores... But a good game with underwhelming scores will still find its audience.
                I agree, though i'd also add that in modern times another Factor which can help sales-wise is exposure in sense of -> Influencer. Like there are quite some Games, like as example "Among Us" which at first struggled really hard, than Influencer played it and then it spread like a wildfire. 

But yeah i agree with you, these days people don't care as much anymore about ratings or user-rants (and i'd argue in a way -> thankfully). Just what they're interesting in and find fun.
    Just for the record, that's about the same metascore as the legendary spider-man 2 game on ps2/xbox. Critics go into games with their own mindset and sometimes it just doesn't align with what the general population will think about the game.
Was really hoping for high 80s. I know people say reviews don’t matter but in a game like this they actually do. With all these other games releasing right now there are a TON of people that buy games based off reviews. A 78 on metacritic does nothing to convince someone to buy a game vs something like an 89. Combined with how short the story is and how low the player base will probably already be this is a little disappointing.
    They shot themselves in the foot by not supporting cross platform multiplayer and alienating PC players by excluding them from promotions like the demo boni and early access.


It's a great monster hunter-style game, but 7/10-8/10 is perfectly justifiable.


Standards have to mean something, and score inflation is an issue. 9/10-10/10 go to games like Baldur's Gate 3.
        > demo boni

While this is simple to add, the demo bonuses aren't even great.
            They were so insignificant that I don't even remember what I got.
                The best thing was the Stamina III stone thing. Everything else evaporated due to prices of weaponry and items.
                    Stamina III is an amazingly good sigil and in fact will last you the entire main story and up to the very hard tier quest unlock.
                then the fact that it still happened makes this even worse, if they are that insignificant, why didnt PC get anything?
        EXACTLY.

The game when form my wishlist from 8 year to wait for sale in less than 6 hours. The mother fuckinng game is no even in pre order on steam so i cant know the price regional tag until the game release so i cant choose to purchase on PS5 or console according to my budget.

Im saving my money for final fantasy Remake, square enix indeed want my money.
    Yeah… no shot it was getting high 80s tbqh.

Game is good, but not the kind of good that would attract mainstream appeal to a relatively niche game.
    It’s true.  I’m a gigantic persona fan and if reloaded wasn’t in gamepass I’d have to pass on it because I have too many new games and too much coming out
    Its there own fault. instead of having you fight the same damn monster over and over except this time he is on fire and etc just like in the campaign they should have added more monsters and expanded the weapons system a little better. its fun but its rite aid monster hunter and it gets old fast. The game has great bones but they phoned it in a bit too much. With all that being said its far and away better than suicide squad. just had to throw that in there since im salty i paid 100 for that garbage
        Ha, the combat was so boring that I said it’ll need a decent amount of enemy variation to be fun, and they failed on that aspect too, huh? 

Still, the fact that you dropped 100$ for a game, that literally everyone knew was going to be trash from a mile away, is crazy.
That’s great in todays oversaturated and curated market.
    And that's pure cope
I think it's pretty clear from a few of these reviewers that they played the main story only (aka what I've seen several people refer to as the "tutorial").


Between all the titles releasing, unfortunately doesn't surprise me that they probably rushed the story in 8 hours and called it a day. 
    Yeah I feel people need to understand in a game like this the meat is after the story ends. Monster Hunter is big enough that people sort of know what the deal is but a new game like this it needed to be marketed a bit better. I didn’t have a clue about anything about this game until I did multiple deep dives myself actively searching for info and even then, it’s not until now people are getting their hands on the game that we are beginning to understand exactly the gameplay and progression loops and the content available. Many people just think it’s a standard action JRPG where you finish the story and that’s the point.

That being said, 7-8 is what I expected for this game. I agree with it, the story is ok at best but everything else is very fun so far. Finally reaching more challenge now in very hard/extreme difficulty quests. I hope I can play online easier with people as more finish the story and pick the game up (god damn what a bad time to release this game)
        >Monster Hunter is big enough that people sort of know what the deal is but a new game like this it needed to be marketed a bit better. I didn’t have a clue about anything about this game until I did multiple deep dives myself actively searching for info and even then, i

I mean this is just unfair to them. I don't really understand why we talk about marketing so anecdotally. They absolutely marketed exactly how the game worked on multiple occasions. They uploaded multiple long form videos explaining the systems and how the game worked.

Before release we knew the story was about 10-15 hours with about 100 hours of post game. We knew about the sigil system and the general shape of gameplay. They also have done multiple showcases of the game.

If anything your lack of knowledge about what the game offers is only a testament to its long dev cycle as opposed to its marketing.
        Yeah I definitely think the 75-80 range seems like a good spot. It does many, many things very well, but its story is lacking. It's just not the main reason to play this game (although what it does have story-wise is enjoyable). 
    FYI ign gave it an 8 and played for 35 + hours. Just saying that it’s dismissive to all these reviews is a bit ridiculous.
        I said few, not all. As in, a couple of the 60 scored reviews. I don't see saying "a few reviewers" as dismissing all of them. 
    I think it’s pretty clear you didn’t actually read the reviews. It’s a good game but has flaws. One reviewer gave it a “not yet” but loved so much of the game but felt the difficulty was too easy and took away any reason to really dive into the systems. 

Just because not everyone gives it 9s and 10s doesn’t mean it’s a bad game or that they just didn’t get it or play end game enough. Not everything has to be for everyone 
        I did read them. And a handful of them did come off this way. I even agree with some of the 7 out of 10s.


I can have issues with a couple reviews and still agree that the game isn't perfect. 
            My mistake. I misread what you said as “these reviewers” when you clearly said a few. 
                No worries, it happens! Hope you're enjoying Granblue (or if PC, will be enjoying it). 
        Hey, that was me! A lot of reactions in this thread are precisely why I dislike numerical scores (and stopped using them myself years ago).

There is simply too much crucial context contained in a review to distill down to a single number. A number that means different things to different people and heck, even different reviewers!
            I loved reading your review. If you don’t mind me asking, are you generally pretty good at action RPGs? I was interested in getting this game but your concerns with difficulty is giving me pause. I normally play action RPGs and action games in general on normal and find it to be a good challenge 
                Generally speaking yes. I play most action games and action RPGs on the hardest or next to hardest difficulty. To give an actual example. I beat God of War Ragnarok on the second to hardest difficulty. (The hardest one gave me fits)

Funny enough, I tried to keep in mind while reviewing Relink that I'm 35 and have been playing games for a long time, and that could be skewing my perspective. So I conducted a little test.

I asked my partner to give it a try blind. I set her up against an ice variant of the Quakadile, and let her pick her team. She was around 500 below the advised power level. This particular quest was listed as either hard or very hard, can't quite remember which.

But in any case, without knowing anything about the game, and playing it for the first time, she won. She didn't do very well, but she won. I took that instance as evidence that I wasn't being overly critical of the low difficulty.
    Gotta rush thru relink in time for Persona after all
This is a game where postgame and farming is very important. Like how can reviews now be relevant? For people who play the story and quit? Sure u can do it but this is not that kind of game. Like people should take their time before reviewing
This is the game i want final fantasy 16 would learn. The gearing so good. Battle is fun. 
IGN They didn't even care to make a video review. :(
    Took them a while

https://youtu.be/ur3HD5Qn1u4
        Thanks. Every game deserved a video review.
Hey, I'm one of those! Honestly, I expected higher scores, but I guess I can understand why. I talked a bunch with others who were also playing it at work and we all came to the conclusion that Relink does well everything it wants to do. But others evaluate it based on what it *isn't*, which is fair, it's a different approach I guess.  


I do think it's weird we had an embargo until today when people who bought it could play it days ago lol
    I'm pretty sure the late(r) embargo was intentional. Devs didn't have a lot of faith in this thing.
30 hours into the game and i've reached Maniac Difficulty and done the story.  My review would've sat at 9/10 but the lack of monster diversity set it back to 8/10. 

The story mission is extremely fun and the haptic feedback on the PS5 is really good. Boss fights are all epic.

Progression system is interesting... You level up your weapons like the main game and uncap them to reach higher stats and receive passive bonus stats on the weapon.   You supplement those stats with "sigils" that are additional passive and crystal you can infuse into your weapon. 

Character diversity wise. It's good but it lacks a male mage caster and a female quick attacker (Lancelot-Style). Kinda wish they included the duo Sturm and Drang in the game to fill the hole.

Multiplayer right now is in a weird position... Quickplay is almost instant or give me an "Error to network connection".... I'll wait until everyone has reached the endgame before talking about it.
    Isnt Charlotta a “quick-attacker”?
        She lack mobility if I recall correctly
            She has some
    Zeta isnt?
        She's the Dragoon of GBF. She only goes in one direction
I see some reviews pointing out the same issue I have with the game: there's no character customization, so the endgame is only about making the numbers grow in contrast to something like Monster Hunter
    I believe there's simple reason why the game won't/shouldn't have higher than 8/10 based on the reviews I've read (and as I've stated in other comments). 

The story is far too short and too unoriginal to be considered a 9 or 10/10. Besides that I imagine it's simply the grinding part which to some of us is a big selling point, but to others, they'll hate it. 

But mostly i expected the story to be okay, but not great, thus I think the game will perfectly sit at a 8/10
    Understandable complaint, but easily fixed with additions in the future. It’s a much better situation than the game releasing broken and unplayable.
        Sure, but it doesn't feel like they plan to make that kind of changes. The last update is expected to come out in May, bringing the new boss and/or new character(s) and that's it
            Actually no. New boss is March and characters April. May unknown. In a recent interview with Kayane the direct said it will receive continual support and they plan to add harder quests, harder fighters and such starting with Lucilius. 

Also cygames are know ,for taking and implementing feedback. They changed an insane amount of things in GBVSR based on feedback.
                They've shown a roadmap for 2024 on a recent Relink Showcase - Part 2 video. The latest update 1.3.0 is planned for May, which is what I was referring to. And they literally say that "That's everything we currently have planned", which (to me) sounds like "if the game isn't a huge hit, we're not planning to do more updates". But we'll see

As for Kayane's interview, Fukuhara might have meant those March/April/May updates they've already announced
                    I know you were referring to the livestream. He specifically said planned and not something like the final update. He always does this if you’ve watch previous streams and they continue to support the games and release new “planned” content. He never likes to reveal too much. Gbvs died because of bad netcode and Covid the month after but they did new content and updates for 3 years until the new game. Relink would have to tank hard for them to drop it. They play and love their games. 

Now new content after may be paid dlc too … which I’m fine with personally.
                    Granblue Versus was a flop and still received 2 years of (paid) content.  

They appear to have a solid foundation with Relink and they'll most likely keep the support going a bit longer.

I believe there will be a sequel to Relink (~3-4years from now) and every character released will be ported over to the next one.
    Yeah, the customization is very underwhelming, and one of my main gripes.

No armor or skins, only 6 (?) weapons per character, a bunch of generic +stat nodes, and jewels not really changing up your gameplay much at all. You also don't make any choices in the skill tree, as you can eventually get everything.

All of this ends in a very shallow customization system, and I would've personally liked more.
        Remeber there are 20+ characters. if u compare to mh, which only has less weapons type/playstyle and  12sigils
        Somome on here that actually gets it. Thank you. Gameplay wise it's stunning, but thr level of depth in terms of armours, weapons and skills (you can unlock all meaning no players are different if they both have same character basically)
        If they listened to you, we would have microtransaction outfits and weapon skins
            Good take!

Following your reasoning, they might as well remove all characters but Gran, or it might turn into a gacha.
    Exactly. I want bad ass looking armour to show off so that people can see how boss you are. Here there's a few colour shades and that's it.
    Agreed. Enjoying it but doubt I'll play much past the story tbh. Not when so many other games are coming out. Customization with armors would have gone a long way. Owells still a very solid 7.5.
It's fair ngl. Main story may be really confusing for people who aren't familiar with the IP.

Btw GBF Versus also got 8/10 from IGN and yet Cygames still released GBF Versus: Rising. So it's not like Relink will meet its doom soon. Remember we'll get Lucilius boss fight in March and 2 new characters in April.
    That means they really liked Vs. Since when did 8 mean bad?
        Well with score inflation and all, 7-8 is average. 9-10 is good. Most people will only have their eyes on 9-10 games
My only issue with it atm is how hard it is to find multiplayer co-op stuff on PS5. Turns out I'd preordered it awhile ago before I got my new GPU on my PC and didn't even remember til my app alerted me that it had been downloaded.   


But also I'm only at the Easy level of co-op missions, so people probly aren't playing those much lol
    That’s the main reason why 

Most people aren’t running easy missions in Co-Op unless it’s with friends, you’ll have a far better time finding people to play with in higher difficulties

Since I’ve used monster hunter an example in other comments I’ll use it here too: Monster hunter has “low rank” which is basically the starter point for multiplayer. It’s extremely rare to find a single person playing low rank in online mode, even though the game has a giant playerbase
        Yeah I figured. I'm just doing the Easy stuff myself, which is still fun. A sign of good gameplay is that even the co-op stuff is fun alone lol
            Yes cuz I like the challenge of trying to get the highest rank possible alone. It's a sign you mastered your character
Though the game's already out in early access, I'd be happy to answer questions if that interests anyone.  I managed to put in 30 hours for my review (even got the flu in the middle of it all!) and gave it a 9.5 for TechRaptor.
81 is a good score, should be a bit higher imo. Just nearing the end of the story and it’s fantastic so far. Interested to see how it progresses into the end game but 5.5 and 6s seem ridiculously low 🤔
Yes 👏🏽 definitely deserve it! This will definitely bring more players for multiplayer!
Wow the metacritic at 79 is lower than I thought. I was expecting 80 at least (I know, I know 79 is so close to 80, but it makes a different impression at first glance)

EDIT: Oh lookie here, the metacritic went to 80 now lol yay

It's a good game though, and the reviews are fair imo. The single player story is short and the actual plot itself is not very interesting. The gameplay and boss battles are fun.

And of course, the meat of the game for most people excited for it is most likely the post/end game where it's more of a "Monster Hunter" type grind to improve your characters.

I preordered PS5 and have been playing maybe 10 hours so far and it is very fun. I mean if you liked the demo and wanted more, it's for you. I just wish they implemented cross-play, as I hope the matchmaking at end game feels populated otherwise it will be really lame
People need something to shit on during a banging year of games. They not gon shit on Yakuza, DD2, or Persona, so they gotta attack GBFRL.
    But.. Suicide squad is right there tho
        Damn, you might be right tho
i think we’re too used to game journalists inflating scores since they’re beholden to the big gaming companies giving them codes. for example ff16 and tales of arise got an 87/100 but imo those games are more like a 50-60/100 while i consider this game to be a 95/100. 

it’s all subjective of course but we’re getting the journalist’s actual opinions here since they don’t need to brown nose for future review copies
    Well Pesona 3 Reload and Like A Dragon 8 gets 90. VG247 who gives Relink 60 gives Like A Dragon 100. To me the scores only means if the IP is those reviews favorite.
    I agree, judging by the demo and gameplays this game is VERY similar to tales of arise in pretty much everything... the only difference is that Granblue has less filler and dialogue between characters but way more characters to play with, yet tales got away with all the negative things these reviews are complaining. 
        Tales of Arise is a much bigger game which would have given it a better score. That stuff you call filler is stuff that many are complaining Relink is missing in its campaign. You might not like that stuff but others do, hence the better score given to Arise.
            I know thats why I pointed those only  differences!, still everything else is the same as tales of arise. I myself usually enjoy character banter and a long story, I loved it in games like ys 9, persona, scarlet nexus etc. but in tales of arise it was clearly boring and tedious. It felt like filler to me and other friends of mine that played the game. Arise felt very weak outside of the combat, u couldn't talk with most npcs, enter houses, the maps where also very linear like in granblue yet they got away with all of that!, not like granblue. 
                Arise is not chapter and mission based, this is nothing like Tales,more close to Monster Hunter
It's hilarious to see someone give 3/5. Definitely not worth reading.
    Why
        3/5 is 60/100. To me it means it AT LEAST can be called a game. Other comments have also mentioned that VG247 gives it 3/5 because this IP is originally from gacha game which that reivewer really hates.
            Lmao VG247 is so effing bias
            Ah that’s sad I understand
    I would say that, generally, reviews giving games 3-3.5/5 or like 70/100 are the most worth reading.

Unless we're talking Gollum, those 1/5 reviews are often just "game bad", which isn't compelling reading if you want to know what a game is like.  In the same vein, 10/10 are just as unhelpful because its just a full page *gluck gluck gluck*.

Even if I disagree with them, I find middle of the road review at least discuss good things about a game and also some complaint.  Maybe those complaints don't matter to you but its nice to see some criticism.
        We've reached a point in gaming reviews where anything less than "5/5 best thing ever, new genre-defining masterpiece" is considered the same as giving the game a 1/5, it's kinda ridiculous. If I saw a 3/5 review I'd think the game is probably decent if not good and something you don't need to rush out and play right now unless you're a fan already. I would not think "this reviewer has something against this game!" When did gamers stop being normal?
They give 9 to games that have high probability of goty contenders and 10 to probable goty. They just ignore games like Octopath Traveler and now Granblue…mostly JRPGs no matter how good these games are. Last year Baldur Gate 3 won because of crazy hype created on social media that it’s 300+ hours of play with multiple endings, characters and builds or it would end up in the same bin.

Also all reviewers are usually linked. It’s a business and they want little to no mismatch between ratings. They will find one idiotic reason or the other and are usually forgiven and  forgotten for ruining a million dollars game in 10 minutes.
    Baldurs Gate 3 won because it was an incredibly ambitious and well executed RPG, with a metric fuckton of depth, build variety and decision making for the player.

There is a reason why other developers went out to tell players not to expect that kind of quality from every other RPG.

Are you implying that Baldurs Gate was not a worthy winner?
        Elden Ring was goty because of a reason. BG3 was not well executed but well hyped. You have more guns because it won but it’s a piece of shit comparing with previous goty winners. You put it against Witcher 3, Sekiro or Last of us it falls far behind in any department except hype. I never opened so many menus to execute a simple action on any goty before. Characters walk speed of lag compared to any other game.

But it has won so you can find 1000 excuses to suppress my opinion.
            Not going to refute those other games that you mention because they were also fantastic games. Elden Ring is actually one of my personal favorite games.

That doesn't make Baldurs Gate 3 any less of a worthy winner 2023.
            You're a crackhead lol
                Ok methhead
            It's going to depend on gamer preferences of course, but I really think Baldur's Gate 3 is "goty" for good reasons that the other OP listed above, NOT just because of hype. The game clearly isn't for you, but I think it equally on par with Elden Ring, they're just both different beasts doing different things.
10/10 for me.
Why not better? Now it won't be a smash hit...
    It's getting an average of 80 (8/10) which based on the flaws I expected and hear, is exactly what it deserves. A solid great score, I don't think the game compares in scale and ambition as ff7 and dragon's dogma will. Its story is simply far too short and too lacking/unoriginal to be a 9 or 10/10. 

But I'm only basing this on reviews, but based on versus and their animation, their stories has always been pretty average at best.
This could have been immense... What they gave us basically was a shallow game with a hefty grind at the end... Beautiful art style, gorgeous music and unbelievable combat, brought down by a weak story, a short story, and a lack of real quality at the end... I don't want to grind the same bosses over and over again.

It's unfortunate becasue they could have and probably should have, after 8 years, knocked this out thr park, but with money tight for most atm and other games in the JRPG area coming out at the same time and offering much more (for the majority of players... I get there's a hardcore group that love the grind) I feel this game is gonna dip right off.
    This definitely just reads as someone who didn’t really touch the end game much at all, which is where the main meat of the game is at 

By your standards I’m assuming monster hunter and other hub based games are shallow
        To be fair, from the looks of it MH is magnitudes better at what it does than Relink seems to be.
            Eh. 

As someone’s who’s played monster hunter since monster hunter Tri, not really. It’s the same fights over and over, then new difficulty, then the same thing again. Game only gets more to it when the dlcs come out and post game content gets launched over time. L

And that’s not a diss at the game, it being a hub based grind is it’s charm and the reason people like it. Doesn’t make it shallow, and that’s the same for relink, it being a hub based game doesn’t make it shallow. Shallow implies there is nothing to it

Monster hunters MAIN complaint from the new generation games has been that it launches with “not enough” content at first.
                Should've been more clear, my mistake.

I'm not saying MH executes the gameplay loop any "better", it just offers "more" of everything that's relevant to it. Most entries do anyways.

More encounter variety (minus Tri, maybe base World), apparently more challenging content (base Gen 5 in a weird spot here), technically more involved progression via crafting.

Haven't heard anything about new mechanics in higher rank iterations of the same fight, so I guess they tie here for now.
                    My only complaint with relink is that the end game grind is ridiculous, easy even on hard. The boss just became a meat shield.
    Yeah, it's kind of what I expected. I'm planning on picking it up as a kind of "fast food game". It's not too long, seems to be enjoyable enough, looks pretty. I'll play through it, try the endgame a bit, then move on (probably to Persona 3 Reload).
    You’re being downvoted but you aren’t wrong. This game could have been so much more imo. They advertised a 20 hour story, we got a 10 hour story. The main content is endgame but there is hardly any customization other than sigils. Also doesn’t look like there’s much end game boss variety either. In a time when all these other developers are pumping out amazing jrpgs, I feel like they really missed here.
        From a review I've seen, this is spoiler territory ofc >! apparently there are more story content even after the end credit, chapter 11 unlocks after you gather something (?). And then after that there are even more story which unlocks with some other means. So there are definitely enough story content for 20 hours, but people might not have figured out how to fully unlock them yet. !<

Personally I am a PC player so idk how true this is, but the reviewer seems to played a shit load of this game (probably more than most reviewers). He also gave high praises on how some of the boss fights are on par with FFXVI, and that alone is more than impressive.
            Who was the reviewer? I heard something similar from Fextralife but I was listening with one ear because I was too busy. Don't remember anything about chapter 11, but he did say there's 10 hours more after the story is over and I was somewhat confused.
                A Chinese reviewer on Bilibili, if you know Chinese here: https://b23.tv/msyAJ6R

Otherwise this is like the first thing he mentioned in the review at 0:30 ish
    There's going to be a lot of good games this year, but this isn't one of them. Infinite Wealth, Rebirth, Unicorn Overlord., etc. My heart goes out to the people who waited years for this thing, only to be given a 10 hour tutorial as a single-player campaign and side content that's essentially mindless MMO raids with so many reskinned monsters. Hopefully the developers can learn from their mistakes and actually give us something worthwhile in the future.
I was hoping for at least 80, but at least 90 to buy at launch for $70.
As is the cope
Honestly I can say my expectations is pretty much a 8/10 for the game. I don't think it deserves higher no matter how much -I- might end up loving it. A very short story that from what I hear is quite average at best already knocks it down from a 9/10 or 10/10. I expect the game to have a wonderful world with amazing combat and multiplayer, but with such a lacking story, I think 8/10 is the fairest score the game can get, but that's based on what I've read so far. 

Cygames just aren't good at telling good stories.
    Eh idk, some of their side stories are really good. Wmtsb was definitely a highlight imo, "And you..." was pretty cool as well. However the story of Relink is definitely a classic and short one, that'll probably do the job of introducing new players to their universe quickly, but is also lacking in substance as a trade-off of their choices. For that reason, I agree that 8/10 is pretty good for the game, even if my enjoyment of it goes beyond that score.
        Yeah, so I've heard. But overall their reputation of telling stories is very up and down. It's hard to rate their story telling from a mobile browser gacha game. Versus and rising from what I hear also had very generic/classic stories that was quite forgettable so I expected the same for relink. 

Point simply is that if people expect or thinks the game deserves higher than 8/10, they need to just understand that some people will be buying the game thinking it's a typical JRPG with a focus on story, which will lead to disappointment. I'm so excited to play the game though, it's story was never what I was after, but I DID hope they'd surprise me with its quality, it seems they won't be.
            Yeah, I agree. Tbh if they made a game with the level of some of their side stories (or the peak moments of the main story because it DOES have some), it'd be awesome, but I'll take relink as it is. That score is accurate and good enough for what it offers, despite its flaws it's absolutely a good and fun game.
In other words - just buy Starfield
    Starfield's not even the same type of game? Unless you're joking or whatever lol
Read through all of these, and they seem fair.   
  
The linearity is one major complaint that I think most folks anticipated. I can also understand the frustration that comes from Relink simultaneously having 19 different characters and an endgame grind that encourages funneling all resources into just one. In addition, the robust endgame doesn't excuse the issues reviewers have with the main story. If you prefer levels and immersion over pure arena battles, then the endgame content is going to feel like a step down from the story.

Still a great first try though, and I hope the team gets another shot with fewer development issues and none of the platform-exclusivity shenanigans Relink experienced.
At launch I think these reviews are pretty fair. In the future the game can improve with raids/DLC but 7-8/10 ain’t bad.
Having put a good amount of hours in these scores are fair to me. The anime trope story isn’t new same as always and the targeting is kinda making it unplayable for me sometimes it’s that bad. The combat is the best part but the targeting makes me wanna just turn the game off sometimes
Why do you guys and gals care about review scores so much? I’ve seen some people be like like a dragon got a 9 or perfect score yet no one review mentions how shady sega is being with it’s dlc lately.

A game like relink was never gonna get a perfect score or be the top game when the west only real exposure to gb is versus/versus rising. You guys complain about the customization but it’s hard to add costumes to a game like that and they haven’t said they aren’t adding any. At this point just be happy it’s coming out
This game is a gem. I'm on final chapter in story and it pays respect to jrpg of old and feels great in combat and music. 

It's monster hunter loop with ff14 mechanics and tales of arise visuals. If that sounds like your jam then this game is for you. 

I'd say 9/10 from me. Slight gripe with camera but this game is a banger.
I know what really matters is that I’m having an absolute blast with this game. It makes me want to go back and dive more into GBFVs especially with the new game out. Might even check out the anime
I will take the opinion from people in this sub over a critic any day, thank you. 🎮😁👍
I feel like we the players and the reviewers played two different games.
This is why I can never take gaming "journalism" seriously.
That’s cool. I give the game a solid 8.5/10. It’s fantastic!
I'm not surprised. The game is not meant for critics since a huge chunk of the game is in the post game.

User Reviews are pretty high in comparison, which shows the game won't have a huge impact on release, but people will love it more over time as word of mouth goes around. Plus the game is getting more free DLC over time.

I get the same feeling from Relink as I got with the original Dragon's Dogma. Most people fucking hated the game back in the day, but I saw there was something special in it. I'm sure a lot more people will start loving Relink over time.
May this go down in history as an amazing underrated gem
It seems all the reviews are agreeing with each, that the game is a decent game but definitely not a must buy.  The demo gave me a janky feel, especially the camera movement was so janky and I think it still is.
8/10 is fair, the game is a fucking blast though... and so addictive. Personally a 9/10 for me.
Is this game gacha?
    No. There are no microtransactions or paid dlcs
This game is pretty awesome. Fuck what they talkin about
That score is kinda good, for a "first" game yeah it's really great !
I don't undertand people saying that 8/10 is bad, when i got that result in school i'm really happy xD
Sites that I like rated it high which is all that matters.  The ones you have listed are a shortlist of inept journalists that I definitely don’t pay attention to
It definitely should be placed much higher. This is like Monster Hunter and Phantasy Star Online 2 combined but with an anime background and universe. I absolutely love this game. I’m obsessed
I dont really play games like thid but gave it a go and really enjoying it. I like the sniper dude and just hang back doing dmg
I thought that was such a weird take. It gave me an urge to go watch the anime, but that's about it. Maybe checking out the free option for Versus Rising. 


Guess they played the story and said "oh they put likable characters to get me to go pay for them in a different game" rather than realizing there's other ways to get the story outside of gacha. 
What a take LOL. Take it from someone who really really wanted to be able to get into GBF. This game will get 1% to actually play GBF and stick through
    Yeah even people who would enjoy grinding in this game are likely to bounce off of GBF. That game is like a drug for a specific type of person.

I think Cygames wants to expand the ip and dive into other genres. And this game was a great chance to put the Dragalia Lost team to work.
        I just realized where the whole raid boss thing came from. Damn I miss dragalia lost. The bosses were always fun to tackle with players.
            Yeah I think its fun watching people go "woah these are designed like FFXIV boss fights" cause like they are, but you'd already know Cygames is putting out these kinds of games if you fought high midgardsormr, high mercury, and co when they were current !

They were insane for ever dropping that on mobile. If Dragalia released on console like this I would still be playing right now.
                Oh I would be happy with a single player dragalia and just make the multiplayer peer to peer. I just wanna listen to the Japanese pop while killing big ass dragons and some.
                Granblue always kind of felt like it was riffing on FF14 (and 11) though in myriad ways. The game released and was being actively updated during 2.0 release window and it kind of shows considering the initial premise ends up being 1:1 with it
                    This isn't surprising considering Cygames was founded by people who were originally apart of Square. The devs of GBF worked on Final Fantasy games before they founded cygames.

The spirit of FF games can be found all throughout the games. Hell some of the boss themes are even composed by Uematsu.
        There’s a lot of people doomsaying about Elder Scrolls VI, but I’d anticipate this reviewer (if they still have a job by that time) making the same argument. “Well it’s the same franchise so it’ll make you go play ESO and buy crown crown crates!”

Sounds like they just didn’t like the game much and wanted a better reason to give it a lower score than just “I didn’t like it”, so made an argument that makes no sense.
        Ohhh, I kinda felt like this game was like Dragalia Lost. I played that game for a bit and kept saying to myself. I wish I they’d just had released this as a regular non gacha game.
        100% this, I fucking love this game, and I like some of the characters, but I don’t give a single fuck about other GBF media. Might watch the anime though.
Imagine considering yourself a journalist with a take like that. 

It's like saying "I give this Volkswagen a 3/5 even though it's great because it's German and I don't like Nazis."

What utter garbage.
She's full of virtue signalling.
This is extremely stupid, not just for the take, but also because Granblue shits out free pulls (I know years ago it did) constantly, back to back, almost nonstop. I don't recall anyone ever, even haters, stating "the game is greedy and wants you to gacha". Hell, the only complain I ever see for the source is that it's grindy to the point of being a full time job (and even cost some people theirs with poor time management).
    It still does that, yes, but in fairness: Once you start getting into it, a LOT of the "general pool" SSRs are second rate while most of the powerful, key pieces in any endgame team are limited (seasonal, flashfest, or legfest). But that's only a very small part of the overall experience, grinding will get you 99% of the way anywhere.
        I should note while good chars are indeed in flash and leg, the last year or so they have shifted to more powerful chars in the general pool. There's actually a number of chars in the general pool that are meta in their niche now.
            There's always been *some* strong units in the general pool (starting back when gandalf and yoda were meta), yes.
Lmao Ive played mobage GBF since day one and not even spend a dime. That game itself is hella generous with crystals lol
    You aren't even encouraged to spend. Everyone says to save for 6% banners.
Wait what? As someone who plays a couple of Gacha I fail to see how Granvlue is lead to that.
I'm gonna be honest I didnt know Granblue had a gacha until I read that review. All I knew about Granblue is that it has an anime and a 2d fighting game. Got no clue where bud was going with that take.
    Today I learned there was an anime. Just thought it was the gacha, fighters, and this.
Honestly, while I think it's important to keep gbf's origins close to the conversation at all times, I think it's a better idea to just say "If you're curious about the gacha, play this and VS only because gacha are awful for you". Still, I'd rather people veer on the side of caution when it comes to the topic of gacha tbh so I honestly can't blame him.
Can you not just say a review is bad because it didn't give a good score
    the review gave a bad score because it doesn't like an entirely other game, that is a bad review.
Bro should have just stated from the beginning that nothing the game did would get it a good score from him then lol
I feel that’s a bit disingenuous of their issue with the game.

Their issue was the story was short and largely forgettable. Side quests were bland. And there wasn’t much exploration. The game was good but not amazing in anything it did. A fun game that felt like an advertisement for their mobile game.
Relink and Versus rising did make me go back to the gacha after 6-7 years yes
Indeed. They did shock me with saying that they have 100 hours on the game even tho it’s been out for not even 100 hours😭
"generic"

FFXVI - 100
    FF16 is infinitely less generic than Grandblue. Also it told a complete story. 

Grandblue is pretty much "yeah itll continue at some point lol".

I'm not surprised tho, they update the story of the gacha twice per year.
        Less generic in terms of story maybe.. But in terms of an rpg game is 2/10 compared to Granblue. In terms of post game content again  is a 2/10. Combat wise i think they are even. Games must be reviewed for the whole package they offer not only story and while i enjoy heavy story driven games like FF16, I think i was watching more like a movie than actually playin an rpg game.
        Ff16 is just a copy paste of ff4 the after years, so that made it generic for me.
How much did they give Suicide Squad?
    No reviews yet but that game will likely get pretty bad reviews by the looks of it.
    Hehe maybe 2/10-6/10.
People acting like high 70s to.low 80s is a bad game its just not goty material its still a 7 to.8 out of 10 that's very good. For some it'll be great
    Averaged out its basically a unanimous 8/10, so that's great on the scale. There are plenty of games in that range (or lower) that are worthwhile. Neo: TWEWY was my favourite game of 2021 sitting at a 80 avg, I loved Gravity Rush 2, heck I liked Stranger of Paradise and Valkyrie Elysium a lot and they scored way lower. 8/10 is good regardless, but at the end of the day, if the game speaks to you subjectively, the score doesn't matter all that much.
    I don’t trust people who aren’t invested with a game like this. Someone coming in with zero knowledge of Granblue is not going to have the same consensus as someone who has played the gacha, Versus, watched the anime etc. Lots of people praised Starfield before it came out, then realized over time it was hot garbage. I would be more inclined to trust a review from a pure JPRG streamer/reviewer over most game review sites.
    FFXI got only a 76% on my game magazin in 2003 but was a realy good MMORPGs for Final Fantasy Fans and its still alive. I dont care about %.
I never expected this game to be GOTY level. I expect that from FF7 Rebirth. I just wanted this game to be fun to do raids with my boiz. It got many of us into the series
Y’all really need to read the content of the reviews rather than obsessing over the scores:

“Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a fantastic game with a compelling story, excellent graphics and sound presentation, and one of the most complex yet entertaining gameplay experiences in the world of video games.”

- AltChar

“Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a fantastic anime adventure, and one that will delight fans of the series.”

- TheSixthAxis

“Excellent on a technical level, courageous in its approach and exemplary in terms of gameplay, Granblue Fantasy: Relink becomes a fantastic benchmark of the genre on its own merits.”

- IGN Spain

- The Outerhaven Productions

“Granblue Fantasy: Relink is an exceptional game that captures the essence of the series wonderfully. With tons of characters to play and a hearty endgame to dive into, Granblue Fantasy: Relink will have you coming back for more.”

- TechRaptor

“If there's one thing that can sum up our adoration for Granblue Fantasy: Relink, it's that Cygames has made the long wait absolutely worth it.

- One More Game

“Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a triumph and one of the most mechanically deep and rewarding action-RPGs in recent memory.

- Hey Poor Player

“Granblue Fantasy: Relink is undoubtedly a love letter to the series.”

- Prima Games

Enjoy the game!
    In fairness: The vast majority of people vaguely interested in the game will look at aggregate scores first and then MAYBE read a review or two. Anyone invested in doing more than that was probably planning to buy the game already and is just looking for reinforcement.
        The vast majority of gamers actually don't look at anything on the internet at all. They just buy games that seem fun and play them. That's why Ubisoft games sell so well. While the internet spends its time whining, arguing about the "formula", repetition, etc, millions of people just go and buy yet another AC game because the cover looked cool. Or the banner on Playstation store screen looked cool. Or a friend wanted to play co-op with them.

Scores are important to a group of gamers, but I genuinely don't think that group is very large. Games don't really fail because of underwhelming scores. They fail for a bunch of other reasons that might also coincidentally lead to those scores... But a good game with underwhelming scores will still find its audience.
            I agree, though i'd also add that in modern times another Factor which can help sales-wise is exposure in sense of -> Influencer. Like there are quite some Games, like as example "Among Us" which at first struggled really hard, than Influencer played it and then it spread like a wildfire. 

But yeah i agree with you, these days people don't care as much anymore about ratings or user-rants (and i'd argue in a way -> thankfully). Just what they're interesting in and find fun.
Just for the record, that's about the same metascore as the legendary spider-man 2 game on ps2/xbox. Critics go into games with their own mindset and sometimes it just doesn't align with what the general population will think about the game.
They shot themselves in the foot by not supporting cross platform multiplayer and alienating PC players by excluding them from promotions like the demo boni and early access.


It's a great monster hunter-style game, but 7/10-8/10 is perfectly justifiable.


Standards have to mean something, and score inflation is an issue. 9/10-10/10 go to games like Baldur's Gate 3.
    > demo boni

While this is simple to add, the demo bonuses aren't even great.
        They were so insignificant that I don't even remember what I got.
            The best thing was the Stamina III stone thing. Everything else evaporated due to prices of weaponry and items.
                Stamina III is an amazingly good sigil and in fact will last you the entire main story and up to the very hard tier quest unlock.
            then the fact that it still happened makes this even worse, if they are that insignificant, why didnt PC get anything?
    EXACTLY.

The game when form my wishlist from 8 year to wait for sale in less than 6 hours. The mother fuckinng game is no even in pre order on steam so i cant know the price regional tag until the game release so i cant choose to purchase on PS5 or console according to my budget.

Im saving my money for final fantasy Remake, square enix indeed want my money.
Yeah… no shot it was getting high 80s tbqh.

Game is good, but not the kind of good that would attract mainstream appeal to a relatively niche game.
It’s true.  I’m a gigantic persona fan and if reloaded wasn’t in gamepass I’d have to pass on it because I have too many new games and too much coming out
Its there own fault. instead of having you fight the same damn monster over and over except this time he is on fire and etc just like in the campaign they should have added more monsters and expanded the weapons system a little better. its fun but its rite aid monster hunter and it gets old fast. The game has great bones but they phoned it in a bit too much. With all that being said its far and away better than suicide squad. just had to throw that in there since im salty i paid 100 for that garbage
    Ha, the combat was so boring that I said it’ll need a decent amount of enemy variation to be fun, and they failed on that aspect too, huh? 

Still, the fact that you dropped 100$ for a game, that literally everyone knew was going to be trash from a mile away, is crazy.
And that's pure cope
Yeah I feel people need to understand in a game like this the meat is after the story ends. Monster Hunter is big enough that people sort of know what the deal is but a new game like this it needed to be marketed a bit better. I didn’t have a clue about anything about this game until I did multiple deep dives myself actively searching for info and even then, it’s not until now people are getting their hands on the game that we are beginning to understand exactly the gameplay and progression loops and the content available. Many people just think it’s a standard action JRPG where you finish the story and that’s the point.

That being said, 7-8 is what I expected for this game. I agree with it, the story is ok at best but everything else is very fun so far. Finally reaching more challenge now in very hard/extreme difficulty quests. I hope I can play online easier with people as more finish the story and pick the game up (god damn what a bad time to release this game)
    >Monster Hunter is big enough that people sort of know what the deal is but a new game like this it needed to be marketed a bit better. I didn’t have a clue about anything about this game until I did multiple deep dives myself actively searching for info and even then, i

I mean this is just unfair to them. I don't really understand why we talk about marketing so anecdotally. They absolutely marketed exactly how the game worked on multiple occasions. They uploaded multiple long form videos explaining the systems and how the game worked.

Before release we knew the story was about 10-15 hours with about 100 hours of post game. We knew about the sigil system and the general shape of gameplay. They also have done multiple showcases of the game.

If anything your lack of knowledge about what the game offers is only a testament to its long dev cycle as opposed to its marketing.
    Yeah I definitely think the 75-80 range seems like a good spot. It does many, many things very well, but its story is lacking. It's just not the main reason to play this game (although what it does have story-wise is enjoyable). 
FYI ign gave it an 8 and played for 35 + hours. Just saying that it’s dismissive to all these reviews is a bit ridiculous.
    I said few, not all. As in, a couple of the 60 scored reviews. I don't see saying "a few reviewers" as dismissing all of them. 
I think it’s pretty clear you didn’t actually read the reviews. It’s a good game but has flaws. One reviewer gave it a “not yet” but loved so much of the game but felt the difficulty was too easy and took away any reason to really dive into the systems. 

Just because not everyone gives it 9s and 10s doesn’t mean it’s a bad game or that they just didn’t get it or play end game enough. Not everything has to be for everyone 
    I did read them. And a handful of them did come off this way. I even agree with some of the 7 out of 10s.


I can have issues with a couple reviews and still agree that the game isn't perfect. 
        My mistake. I misread what you said as “these reviewers” when you clearly said a few. 
            No worries, it happens! Hope you're enjoying Granblue (or if PC, will be enjoying it). 
    Hey, that was me! A lot of reactions in this thread are precisely why I dislike numerical scores (and stopped using them myself years ago).

There is simply too much crucial context contained in a review to distill down to a single number. A number that means different things to different people and heck, even different reviewers!
        I loved reading your review. If you don’t mind me asking, are you generally pretty good at action RPGs? I was interested in getting this game but your concerns with difficulty is giving me pause. I normally play action RPGs and action games in general on normal and find it to be a good challenge 
            Generally speaking yes. I play most action games and action RPGs on the hardest or next to hardest difficulty. To give an actual example. I beat God of War Ragnarok on the second to hardest difficulty. (The hardest one gave me fits)

Funny enough, I tried to keep in mind while reviewing Relink that I'm 35 and have been playing games for a long time, and that could be skewing my perspective. So I conducted a little test.

I asked my partner to give it a try blind. I set her up against an ice variant of the Quakadile, and let her pick her team. She was around 500 below the advised power level. This particular quest was listed as either hard or very hard, can't quite remember which.

But in any case, without knowing anything about the game, and playing it for the first time, she won. She didn't do very well, but she won. I took that instance as evidence that I wasn't being overly critical of the low difficulty.
Gotta rush thru relink in time for Persona after all
Took them a while

https://youtu.be/ur3HD5Qn1u4
    Thanks. Every game deserved a video review.
I'm pretty sure the late(r) embargo was intentional. Devs didn't have a lot of faith in this thing.
Isnt Charlotta a “quick-attacker”?
    She lack mobility if I recall correctly
        She has some
Zeta isnt?
    She's the Dragoon of GBF. She only goes in one direction
I believe there's simple reason why the game won't/shouldn't have higher than 8/10 based on the reviews I've read (and as I've stated in other comments). 

The story is far too short and too unoriginal to be considered a 9 or 10/10. Besides that I imagine it's simply the grinding part which to some of us is a big selling point, but to others, they'll hate it. 

But mostly i expected the story to be okay, but not great, thus I think the game will perfectly sit at a 8/10
Understandable complaint, but easily fixed with additions in the future. It’s a much better situation than the game releasing broken and unplayable.
    Sure, but it doesn't feel like they plan to make that kind of changes. The last update is expected to come out in May, bringing the new boss and/or new character(s) and that's it
        Actually no. New boss is March and characters April. May unknown. In a recent interview with Kayane the direct said it will receive continual support and they plan to add harder quests, harder fighters and such starting with Lucilius. 

Also cygames are know ,for taking and implementing feedback. They changed an insane amount of things in GBVSR based on feedback.
            They've shown a roadmap for 2024 on a recent Relink Showcase - Part 2 video. The latest update 1.3.0 is planned for May, which is what I was referring to. And they literally say that "That's everything we currently have planned", which (to me) sounds like "if the game isn't a huge hit, we're not planning to do more updates". But we'll see

As for Kayane's interview, Fukuhara might have meant those March/April/May updates they've already announced
                I know you were referring to the livestream. He specifically said planned and not something like the final update. He always does this if you’ve watch previous streams and they continue to support the games and release new “planned” content. He never likes to reveal too much. Gbvs died because of bad netcode and Covid the month after but they did new content and updates for 3 years until the new game. Relink would have to tank hard for them to drop it. They play and love their games. 

Now new content after may be paid dlc too … which I’m fine with personally.
                Granblue Versus was a flop and still received 2 years of (paid) content.  

They appear to have a solid foundation with Relink and they'll most likely keep the support going a bit longer.

I believe there will be a sequel to Relink (~3-4years from now) and every character released will be ported over to the next one.
Yeah, the customization is very underwhelming, and one of my main gripes.

No armor or skins, only 6 (?) weapons per character, a bunch of generic +stat nodes, and jewels not really changing up your gameplay much at all. You also don't make any choices in the skill tree, as you can eventually get everything.

All of this ends in a very shallow customization system, and I would've personally liked more.
    Remeber there are 20+ characters. if u compare to mh, which only has less weapons type/playstyle and  12sigils
    Somome on here that actually gets it. Thank you. Gameplay wise it's stunning, but thr level of depth in terms of armours, weapons and skills (you can unlock all meaning no players are different if they both have same character basically)
    If they listened to you, we would have microtransaction outfits and weapon skins
        Good take!

Following your reasoning, they might as well remove all characters but Gran, or it might turn into a gacha.
Exactly. I want bad ass looking armour to show off so that people can see how boss you are. Here there's a few colour shades and that's it.
Agreed. Enjoying it but doubt I'll play much past the story tbh. Not when so many other games are coming out. Customization with armors would have gone a long way. Owells still a very solid 7.5.
That means they really liked Vs. Since when did 8 mean bad?
    Well with score inflation and all, 7-8 is average. 9-10 is good. Most people will only have their eyes on 9-10 games
That’s the main reason why 

Most people aren’t running easy missions in Co-Op unless it’s with friends, you’ll have a far better time finding people to play with in higher difficulties

Since I’ve used monster hunter an example in other comments I’ll use it here too: Monster hunter has “low rank” which is basically the starter point for multiplayer. It’s extremely rare to find a single person playing low rank in online mode, even though the game has a giant playerbase
    Yeah I figured. I'm just doing the Easy stuff myself, which is still fun. A sign of good gameplay is that even the co-op stuff is fun alone lol
        Yes cuz I like the challenge of trying to get the highest rank possible alone. It's a sign you mastered your character
But.. Suicide squad is right there tho
    Damn, you might be right tho
Well Pesona 3 Reload and Like A Dragon 8 gets 90. VG247 who gives Relink 60 gives Like A Dragon 100. To me the scores only means if the IP is those reviews favorite.
I agree, judging by the demo and gameplays this game is VERY similar to tales of arise in pretty much everything... the only difference is that Granblue has less filler and dialogue between characters but way more characters to play with, yet tales got away with all the negative things these reviews are complaining. 
    Tales of Arise is a much bigger game which would have given it a better score. That stuff you call filler is stuff that many are complaining Relink is missing in its campaign. You might not like that stuff but others do, hence the better score given to Arise.
        I know thats why I pointed those only  differences!, still everything else is the same as tales of arise. I myself usually enjoy character banter and a long story, I loved it in games like ys 9, persona, scarlet nexus etc. but in tales of arise it was clearly boring and tedious. It felt like filler to me and other friends of mine that played the game. Arise felt very weak outside of the combat, u couldn't talk with most npcs, enter houses, the maps where also very linear like in granblue yet they got away with all of that!, not like granblue. 
            Arise is not chapter and mission based, this is nothing like Tales,more close to Monster Hunter
Why
    3/5 is 60/100. To me it means it AT LEAST can be called a game. Other comments have also mentioned that VG247 gives it 3/5 because this IP is originally from gacha game which that reivewer really hates.
        Lmao VG247 is so effing bias
        Ah that’s sad I understand
I would say that, generally, reviews giving games 3-3.5/5 or like 70/100 are the most worth reading.

Unless we're talking Gollum, those 1/5 reviews are often just "game bad", which isn't compelling reading if you want to know what a game is like.  In the same vein, 10/10 are just as unhelpful because its just a full page *gluck gluck gluck*.

Even if I disagree with them, I find middle of the road review at least discuss good things about a game and also some complaint.  Maybe those complaints don't matter to you but its nice to see some criticism.
    We've reached a point in gaming reviews where anything less than "5/5 best thing ever, new genre-defining masterpiece" is considered the same as giving the game a 1/5, it's kinda ridiculous. If I saw a 3/5 review I'd think the game is probably decent if not good and something you don't need to rush out and play right now unless you're a fan already. I would not think "this reviewer has something against this game!" When did gamers stop being normal?
Baldurs Gate 3 won because it was an incredibly ambitious and well executed RPG, with a metric fuckton of depth, build variety and decision making for the player.

There is a reason why other developers went out to tell players not to expect that kind of quality from every other RPG.

Are you implying that Baldurs Gate was not a worthy winner?
    Elden Ring was goty because of a reason. BG3 was not well executed but well hyped. You have more guns because it won but it’s a piece of shit comparing with previous goty winners. You put it against Witcher 3, Sekiro or Last of us it falls far behind in any department except hype. I never opened so many menus to execute a simple action on any goty before. Characters walk speed of lag compared to any other game.

But it has won so you can find 1000 excuses to suppress my opinion.
        Not going to refute those other games that you mention because they were also fantastic games. Elden Ring is actually one of my personal favorite games.

That doesn't make Baldurs Gate 3 any less of a worthy winner 2023.
        You're a crackhead lol
            Ok methhead
        It's going to depend on gamer preferences of course, but I really think Baldur's Gate 3 is "goty" for good reasons that the other OP listed above, NOT just because of hype. The game clearly isn't for you, but I think it equally on par with Elden Ring, they're just both different beasts doing different things.
It's getting an average of 80 (8/10) which based on the flaws I expected and hear, is exactly what it deserves. A solid great score, I don't think the game compares in scale and ambition as ff7 and dragon's dogma will. Its story is simply far too short and too lacking/unoriginal to be a 9 or 10/10. 

But I'm only basing this on reviews, but based on versus and their animation, their stories has always been pretty average at best.
This definitely just reads as someone who didn’t really touch the end game much at all, which is where the main meat of the game is at 

By your standards I’m assuming monster hunter and other hub based games are shallow
    To be fair, from the looks of it MH is magnitudes better at what it does than Relink seems to be.
        Eh. 

As someone’s who’s played monster hunter since monster hunter Tri, not really. It’s the same fights over and over, then new difficulty, then the same thing again. Game only gets more to it when the dlcs come out and post game content gets launched over time. L

And that’s not a diss at the game, it being a hub based grind is it’s charm and the reason people like it. Doesn’t make it shallow, and that’s the same for relink, it being a hub based game doesn’t make it shallow. Shallow implies there is nothing to it

Monster hunters MAIN complaint from the new generation games has been that it launches with “not enough” content at first.
            Should've been more clear, my mistake.

I'm not saying MH executes the gameplay loop any "better", it just offers "more" of everything that's relevant to it. Most entries do anyways.

More encounter variety (minus Tri, maybe base World), apparently more challenging content (base Gen 5 in a weird spot here), technically more involved progression via crafting.

Haven't heard anything about new mechanics in higher rank iterations of the same fight, so I guess they tie here for now.
                My only complaint with relink is that the end game grind is ridiculous, easy even on hard. The boss just became a meat shield.
Yeah, it's kind of what I expected. I'm planning on picking it up as a kind of "fast food game". It's not too long, seems to be enjoyable enough, looks pretty. I'll play through it, try the endgame a bit, then move on (probably to Persona 3 Reload).
You’re being downvoted but you aren’t wrong. This game could have been so much more imo. They advertised a 20 hour story, we got a 10 hour story. The main content is endgame but there is hardly any customization other than sigils. Also doesn’t look like there’s much end game boss variety either. In a time when all these other developers are pumping out amazing jrpgs, I feel like they really missed here.
    From a review I've seen, this is spoiler territory ofc >! apparently there are more story content even after the end credit, chapter 11 unlocks after you gather something (?). And then after that there are even more story which unlocks with some other means. So there are definitely enough story content for 20 hours, but people might not have figured out how to fully unlock them yet. !<

Personally I am a PC player so idk how true this is, but the reviewer seems to played a shit load of this game (probably more than most reviewers). He also gave high praises on how some of the boss fights are on par with FFXVI, and that alone is more than impressive.
        Who was the reviewer? I heard something similar from Fextralife but I was listening with one ear because I was too busy. Don't remember anything about chapter 11, but he did say there's 10 hours more after the story is over and I was somewhat confused.
            A Chinese reviewer on Bilibili, if you know Chinese here: https://b23.tv/msyAJ6R

Otherwise this is like the first thing he mentioned in the review at 0:30 ish
There's going to be a lot of good games this year, but this isn't one of them. Infinite Wealth, Rebirth, Unicorn Overlord., etc. My heart goes out to the people who waited years for this thing, only to be given a 10 hour tutorial as a single-player campaign and side content that's essentially mindless MMO raids with so many reskinned monsters. Hopefully the developers can learn from their mistakes and actually give us something worthwhile in the future.
Eh idk, some of their side stories are really good. Wmtsb was definitely a highlight imo, "And you..." was pretty cool as well. However the story of Relink is definitely a classic and short one, that'll probably do the job of introducing new players to their universe quickly, but is also lacking in substance as a trade-off of their choices. For that reason, I agree that 8/10 is pretty good for the game, even if my enjoyment of it goes beyond that score.
    Yeah, so I've heard. But overall their reputation of telling stories is very up and down. It's hard to rate their story telling from a mobile browser gacha game. Versus and rising from what I hear also had very generic/classic stories that was quite forgettable so I expected the same for relink. 

Point simply is that if people expect or thinks the game deserves higher than 8/10, they need to just understand that some people will be buying the game thinking it's a typical JRPG with a focus on story, which will lead to disappointment. I'm so excited to play the game though, it's story was never what I was after, but I DID hope they'd surprise me with its quality, it seems they won't be.
        Yeah, I agree. Tbh if they made a game with the level of some of their side stories (or the peak moments of the main story because it DOES have some), it'd be awesome, but I'll take relink as it is. That score is accurate and good enough for what it offers, despite its flaws it's absolutely a good and fun game.
Starfield's not even the same type of game? Unless you're joking or whatever lol
No. There are no microtransactions or paid dlcs
Yeah even people who would enjoy grinding in this game are likely to bounce off of GBF. That game is like a drug for a specific type of person.

I think Cygames wants to expand the ip and dive into other genres. And this game was a great chance to put the Dragalia Lost team to work.
    I just realized where the whole raid boss thing came from. Damn I miss dragalia lost. The bosses were always fun to tackle with players.
        Yeah I think its fun watching people go "woah these are designed like FFXIV boss fights" cause like they are, but you'd already know Cygames is putting out these kinds of games if you fought high midgardsormr, high mercury, and co when they were current !

They were insane for ever dropping that on mobile. If Dragalia released on console like this I would still be playing right now.
            Oh I would be happy with a single player dragalia and just make the multiplayer peer to peer. I just wanna listen to the Japanese pop while killing big ass dragons and some.
            Granblue always kind of felt like it was riffing on FF14 (and 11) though in myriad ways. The game released and was being actively updated during 2.0 release window and it kind of shows considering the initial premise ends up being 1:1 with it
                This isn't surprising considering Cygames was founded by people who were originally apart of Square. The devs of GBF worked on Final Fantasy games before they founded cygames.

The spirit of FF games can be found all throughout the games. Hell some of the boss themes are even composed by Uematsu.
    There’s a lot of people doomsaying about Elder Scrolls VI, but I’d anticipate this reviewer (if they still have a job by that time) making the same argument. “Well it’s the same franchise so it’ll make you go play ESO and buy crown crown crates!”

Sounds like they just didn’t like the game much and wanted a better reason to give it a lower score than just “I didn’t like it”, so made an argument that makes no sense.
    Ohhh, I kinda felt like this game was like Dragalia Lost. I played that game for a bit and kept saying to myself. I wish I they’d just had released this as a regular non gacha game.
    100% this, I fucking love this game, and I like some of the characters, but I don’t give a single fuck about other GBF media. Might watch the anime though.
It still does that, yes, but in fairness: Once you start getting into it, a LOT of the "general pool" SSRs are second rate while most of the powerful, key pieces in any endgame team are limited (seasonal, flashfest, or legfest). But that's only a very small part of the overall experience, grinding will get you 99% of the way anywhere.
    I should note while good chars are indeed in flash and leg, the last year or so they have shifted to more powerful chars in the general pool. There's actually a number of chars in the general pool that are meta in their niche now.
        There's always been *some* strong units in the general pool (starting back when gandalf and yoda were meta), yes.
You aren't even encouraged to spend. Everyone says to save for 6% banners.
Today I learned there was an anime. Just thought it was the gacha, fighters, and this.
the review gave a bad score because it doesn't like an entirely other game, that is a bad review.
FF16 is infinitely less generic than Grandblue. Also it told a complete story. 

Grandblue is pretty much "yeah itll continue at some point lol".

I'm not surprised tho, they update the story of the gacha twice per year.
    Less generic in terms of story maybe.. But in terms of an rpg game is 2/10 compared to Granblue. In terms of post game content again  is a 2/10. Combat wise i think they are even. Games must be reviewed for the whole package they offer not only story and while i enjoy heavy story driven games like FF16, I think i was watching more like a movie than actually playin an rpg game.
    Ff16 is just a copy paste of ff4 the after years, so that made it generic for me.
No reviews yet but that game will likely get pretty bad reviews by the looks of it.
Hehe maybe 2/10-6/10.
Averaged out its basically a unanimous 8/10, so that's great on the scale. There are plenty of games in that range (or lower) that are worthwhile. Neo: TWEWY was my favourite game of 2021 sitting at a 80 avg, I loved Gravity Rush 2, heck I liked Stranger of Paradise and Valkyrie Elysium a lot and they scored way lower. 8/10 is good regardless, but at the end of the day, if the game speaks to you subjectively, the score doesn't matter all that much.
I don’t trust people who aren’t invested with a game like this. Someone coming in with zero knowledge of Granblue is not going to have the same consensus as someone who has played the gacha, Versus, watched the anime etc. Lots of people praised Starfield before it came out, then realized over time it was hot garbage. I would be more inclined to trust a review from a pure JPRG streamer/reviewer over most game review sites.
FFXI got only a 76% on my game magazin in 2003 but was a realy good MMORPGs for Final Fantasy Fans and its still alive. I dont care about %.
In fairness: The vast majority of people vaguely interested in the game will look at aggregate scores first and then MAYBE read a review or two. Anyone invested in doing more than that was probably planning to buy the game already and is just looking for reinforcement.
    The vast majority of gamers actually don't look at anything on the internet at all. They just buy games that seem fun and play them. That's why Ubisoft games sell so well. While the internet spends its time whining, arguing about the "formula", repetition, etc, millions of people just go and buy yet another AC game because the cover looked cool. Or the banner on Playstation store screen looked cool. Or a friend wanted to play co-op with them.

Scores are important to a group of gamers, but I genuinely don't think that group is very large. Games don't really fail because of underwhelming scores. They fail for a bunch of other reasons that might also coincidentally lead to those scores... But a good game with underwhelming scores will still find its audience.
        I agree, though i'd also add that in modern times another Factor which can help sales-wise is exposure in sense of -> Influencer. Like there are quite some Games, like as example "Among Us" which at first struggled really hard, than Influencer played it and then it spread like a wildfire. 

But yeah i agree with you, these days people don't care as much anymore about ratings or user-rants (and i'd argue in a way -> thankfully). Just what they're interesting in and find fun.
> demo boni

While this is simple to add, the demo bonuses aren't even great.
    They were so insignificant that I don't even remember what I got.
        The best thing was the Stamina III stone thing. Everything else evaporated due to prices of weaponry and items.
            Stamina III is an amazingly good sigil and in fact will last you the entire main story and up to the very hard tier quest unlock.
        then the fact that it still happened makes this even worse, if they are that insignificant, why didnt PC get anything?
EXACTLY.

The game when form my wishlist from 8 year to wait for sale in less than 6 hours. The mother fuckinng game is no even in pre order on steam so i cant know the price regional tag until the game release so i cant choose to purchase on PS5 or console according to my budget.

Im saving my money for final fantasy Remake, square enix indeed want my money.
Ha, the combat was so boring that I said it’ll need a decent amount of enemy variation to be fun, and they failed on that aspect too, huh? 

Still, the fact that you dropped 100$ for a game, that literally everyone knew was going to be trash from a mile away, is crazy.
>Monster Hunter is big enough that people sort of know what the deal is but a new game like this it needed to be marketed a bit better. I didn’t have a clue about anything about this game until I did multiple deep dives myself actively searching for info and even then, i

I mean this is just unfair to them. I don't really understand why we talk about marketing so anecdotally. They absolutely marketed exactly how the game worked on multiple occasions. They uploaded multiple long form videos explaining the systems and how the game worked.

Before release we knew the story was about 10-15 hours with about 100 hours of post game. We knew about the sigil system and the general shape of gameplay. They also have done multiple showcases of the game.

If anything your lack of knowledge about what the game offers is only a testament to its long dev cycle as opposed to its marketing.
Yeah I definitely think the 75-80 range seems like a good spot. It does many, many things very well, but its story is lacking. It's just not the main reason to play this game (although what it does have story-wise is enjoyable). 
I said few, not all. As in, a couple of the 60 scored reviews. I don't see saying "a few reviewers" as dismissing all of them. 
I did read them. And a handful of them did come off this way. I even agree with some of the 7 out of 10s.


I can have issues with a couple reviews and still agree that the game isn't perfect. 
    My mistake. I misread what you said as “these reviewers” when you clearly said a few. 
        No worries, it happens! Hope you're enjoying Granblue (or if PC, will be enjoying it). 
Hey, that was me! A lot of reactions in this thread are precisely why I dislike numerical scores (and stopped using them myself years ago).

There is simply too much crucial context contained in a review to distill down to a single number. A number that means different things to different people and heck, even different reviewers!
    I loved reading your review. If you don’t mind me asking, are you generally pretty good at action RPGs? I was interested in getting this game but your concerns with difficulty is giving me pause. I normally play action RPGs and action games in general on normal and find it to be a good challenge 
        Generally speaking yes. I play most action games and action RPGs on the hardest or next to hardest difficulty. To give an actual example. I beat God of War Ragnarok on the second to hardest difficulty. (The hardest one gave me fits)

Funny enough, I tried to keep in mind while reviewing Relink that I'm 35 and have been playing games for a long time, and that could be skewing my perspective. So I conducted a little test.

I asked my partner to give it a try blind. I set her up against an ice variant of the Quakadile, and let her pick her team. She was around 500 below the advised power level. This particular quest was listed as either hard or very hard, can't quite remember which.

But in any case, without knowing anything about the game, and playing it for the first time, she won. She didn't do very well, but she won. I took that instance as evidence that I wasn't being overly critical of the low difficulty.
Thanks. Every game deserved a video review.
She lack mobility if I recall correctly
    She has some
She's the Dragoon of GBF. She only goes in one direction
Sure, but it doesn't feel like they plan to make that kind of changes. The last update is expected to come out in May, bringing the new boss and/or new character(s) and that's it
    Actually no. New boss is March and characters April. May unknown. In a recent interview with Kayane the direct said it will receive continual support and they plan to add harder quests, harder fighters and such starting with Lucilius. 

Also cygames are know ,for taking and implementing feedback. They changed an insane amount of things in GBVSR based on feedback.
        They've shown a roadmap for 2024 on a recent Relink Showcase - Part 2 video. The latest update 1.3.0 is planned for May, which is what I was referring to. And they literally say that "That's everything we currently have planned", which (to me) sounds like "if the game isn't a huge hit, we're not planning to do more updates". But we'll see

As for Kayane's interview, Fukuhara might have meant those March/April/May updates they've already announced
            I know you were referring to the livestream. He specifically said planned and not something like the final update. He always does this if you’ve watch previous streams and they continue to support the games and release new “planned” content. He never likes to reveal too much. Gbvs died because of bad netcode and Covid the month after but they did new content and updates for 3 years until the new game. Relink would have to tank hard for them to drop it. They play and love their games. 

Now new content after may be paid dlc too … which I’m fine with personally.
            Granblue Versus was a flop and still received 2 years of (paid) content.  

They appear to have a solid foundation with Relink and they'll most likely keep the support going a bit longer.

I believe there will be a sequel to Relink (~3-4years from now) and every character released will be ported over to the next one.
Remeber there are 20+ characters. if u compare to mh, which only has less weapons type/playstyle and  12sigils
Somome on here that actually gets it. Thank you. Gameplay wise it's stunning, but thr level of depth in terms of armours, weapons and skills (you can unlock all meaning no players are different if they both have same character basically)
If they listened to you, we would have microtransaction outfits and weapon skins
    Good take!

Following your reasoning, they might as well remove all characters but Gran, or it might turn into a gacha.
Well with score inflation and all, 7-8 is average. 9-10 is good. Most people will only have their eyes on 9-10 games
Yeah I figured. I'm just doing the Easy stuff myself, which is still fun. A sign of good gameplay is that even the co-op stuff is fun alone lol
    Yes cuz I like the challenge of trying to get the highest rank possible alone. It's a sign you mastered your character
Damn, you might be right tho
Tales of Arise is a much bigger game which would have given it a better score. That stuff you call filler is stuff that many are complaining Relink is missing in its campaign. You might not like that stuff but others do, hence the better score given to Arise.
    I know thats why I pointed those only  differences!, still everything else is the same as tales of arise. I myself usually enjoy character banter and a long story, I loved it in games like ys 9, persona, scarlet nexus etc. but in tales of arise it was clearly boring and tedious. It felt like filler to me and other friends of mine that played the game. Arise felt very weak outside of the combat, u couldn't talk with most npcs, enter houses, the maps where also very linear like in granblue yet they got away with all of that!, not like granblue. 
        Arise is not chapter and mission based, this is nothing like Tales,more close to Monster Hunter
3/5 is 60/100. To me it means it AT LEAST can be called a game. Other comments have also mentioned that VG247 gives it 3/5 because this IP is originally from gacha game which that reivewer really hates.
    Lmao VG247 is so effing bias
    Ah that’s sad I understand
We've reached a point in gaming reviews where anything less than "5/5 best thing ever, new genre-defining masterpiece" is considered the same as giving the game a 1/5, it's kinda ridiculous. If I saw a 3/5 review I'd think the game is probably decent if not good and something you don't need to rush out and play right now unless you're a fan already. I would not think "this reviewer has something against this game!" When did gamers stop being normal?
Elden Ring was goty because of a reason. BG3 was not well executed but well hyped. You have more guns because it won but it’s a piece of shit comparing with previous goty winners. You put it against Witcher 3, Sekiro or Last of us it falls far behind in any department except hype. I never opened so many menus to execute a simple action on any goty before. Characters walk speed of lag compared to any other game.

But it has won so you can find 1000 excuses to suppress my opinion.
    Not going to refute those other games that you mention because they were also fantastic games. Elden Ring is actually one of my personal favorite games.

That doesn't make Baldurs Gate 3 any less of a worthy winner 2023.
    You're a crackhead lol
        Ok methhead
    It's going to depend on gamer preferences of course, but I really think Baldur's Gate 3 is "goty" for good reasons that the other OP listed above, NOT just because of hype. The game clearly isn't for you, but I think it equally on par with Elden Ring, they're just both different beasts doing different things.
To be fair, from the looks of it MH is magnitudes better at what it does than Relink seems to be.
    Eh. 

As someone’s who’s played monster hunter since monster hunter Tri, not really. It’s the same fights over and over, then new difficulty, then the same thing again. Game only gets more to it when the dlcs come out and post game content gets launched over time. L

And that’s not a diss at the game, it being a hub based grind is it’s charm and the reason people like it. Doesn’t make it shallow, and that’s the same for relink, it being a hub based game doesn’t make it shallow. Shallow implies there is nothing to it

Monster hunters MAIN complaint from the new generation games has been that it launches with “not enough” content at first.
        Should've been more clear, my mistake.

I'm not saying MH executes the gameplay loop any "better", it just offers "more" of everything that's relevant to it. Most entries do anyways.

More encounter variety (minus Tri, maybe base World), apparently more challenging content (base Gen 5 in a weird spot here), technically more involved progression via crafting.

Haven't heard anything about new mechanics in higher rank iterations of the same fight, so I guess they tie here for now.
            My only complaint with relink is that the end game grind is ridiculous, easy even on hard. The boss just became a meat shield.
From a review I've seen, this is spoiler territory ofc >! apparently there are more story content even after the end credit, chapter 11 unlocks after you gather something (?). And then after that there are even more story which unlocks with some other means. So there are definitely enough story content for 20 hours, but people might not have figured out how to fully unlock them yet. !<

Personally I am a PC player so idk how true this is, but the reviewer seems to played a shit load of this game (probably more than most reviewers). He also gave high praises on how some of the boss fights are on par with FFXVI, and that alone is more than impressive.
    Who was the reviewer? I heard something similar from Fextralife but I was listening with one ear because I was too busy. Don't remember anything about chapter 11, but he did say there's 10 hours more after the story is over and I was somewhat confused.
        A Chinese reviewer on Bilibili, if you know Chinese here: https://b23.tv/msyAJ6R

Otherwise this is like the first thing he mentioned in the review at 0:30 ish
Yeah, so I've heard. But overall their reputation of telling stories is very up and down. It's hard to rate their story telling from a mobile browser gacha game. Versus and rising from what I hear also had very generic/classic stories that was quite forgettable so I expected the same for relink. 

Point simply is that if people expect or thinks the game deserves higher than 8/10, they need to just understand that some people will be buying the game thinking it's a typical JRPG with a focus on story, which will lead to disappointment. I'm so excited to play the game though, it's story was never what I was after, but I DID hope they'd surprise me with its quality, it seems they won't be.
    Yeah, I agree. Tbh if they made a game with the level of some of their side stories (or the peak moments of the main story because it DOES have some), it'd be awesome, but I'll take relink as it is. That score is accurate and good enough for what it offers, despite its flaws it's absolutely a good and fun game.
I just realized where the whole raid boss thing came from. Damn I miss dragalia lost. The bosses were always fun to tackle with players.
    Yeah I think its fun watching people go "woah these are designed like FFXIV boss fights" cause like they are, but you'd already know Cygames is putting out these kinds of games if you fought high midgardsormr, high mercury, and co when they were current !

They were insane for ever dropping that on mobile. If Dragalia released on console like this I would still be playing right now.
        Oh I would be happy with a single player dragalia and just make the multiplayer peer to peer. I just wanna listen to the Japanese pop while killing big ass dragons and some.
        Granblue always kind of felt like it was riffing on FF14 (and 11) though in myriad ways. The game released and was being actively updated during 2.0 release window and it kind of shows considering the initial premise ends up being 1:1 with it
            This isn't surprising considering Cygames was founded by people who were originally apart of Square. The devs of GBF worked on Final Fantasy games before they founded cygames.

The spirit of FF games can be found all throughout the games. Hell some of the boss themes are even composed by Uematsu.
There’s a lot of people doomsaying about Elder Scrolls VI, but I’d anticipate this reviewer (if they still have a job by that time) making the same argument. “Well it’s the same franchise so it’ll make you go play ESO and buy crown crown crates!”

Sounds like they just didn’t like the game much and wanted a better reason to give it a lower score than just “I didn’t like it”, so made an argument that makes no sense.
Ohhh, I kinda felt like this game was like Dragalia Lost. I played that game for a bit and kept saying to myself. I wish I they’d just had released this as a regular non gacha game.
100% this, I fucking love this game, and I like some of the characters, but I don’t give a single fuck about other GBF media. Might watch the anime though.
I should note while good chars are indeed in flash and leg, the last year or so they have shifted to more powerful chars in the general pool. There's actually a number of chars in the general pool that are meta in their niche now.
    There's always been *some* strong units in the general pool (starting back when gandalf and yoda were meta), yes.
Less generic in terms of story maybe.. But in terms of an rpg game is 2/10 compared to Granblue. In terms of post game content again  is a 2/10. Combat wise i think they are even. Games must be reviewed for the whole package they offer not only story and while i enjoy heavy story driven games like FF16, I think i was watching more like a movie than actually playin an rpg game.
Ff16 is just a copy paste of ff4 the after years, so that made it generic for me.
The vast majority of gamers actually don't look at anything on the internet at all. They just buy games that seem fun and play them. That's why Ubisoft games sell so well. While the internet spends its time whining, arguing about the "formula", repetition, etc, millions of people just go and buy yet another AC game because the cover looked cool. Or the banner on Playstation store screen looked cool. Or a friend wanted to play co-op with them.

Scores are important to a group of gamers, but I genuinely don't think that group is very large. Games don't really fail because of underwhelming scores. They fail for a bunch of other reasons that might also coincidentally lead to those scores... But a good game with underwhelming scores will still find its audience.
    I agree, though i'd also add that in modern times another Factor which can help sales-wise is exposure in sense of -> Influencer. Like there are quite some Games, like as example "Among Us" which at first struggled really hard, than Influencer played it and then it spread like a wildfire. 

But yeah i agree with you, these days people don't care as much anymore about ratings or user-rants (and i'd argue in a way -> thankfully). Just what they're interesting in and find fun.
They were so insignificant that I don't even remember what I got.
    The best thing was the Stamina III stone thing. Everything else evaporated due to prices of weaponry and items.
        Stamina III is an amazingly good sigil and in fact will last you the entire main story and up to the very hard tier quest unlock.
    then the fact that it still happened makes this even worse, if they are that insignificant, why didnt PC get anything?
My mistake. I misread what you said as “these reviewers” when you clearly said a few. 
    No worries, it happens! Hope you're enjoying Granblue (or if PC, will be enjoying it). 
I loved reading your review. If you don’t mind me asking, are you generally pretty good at action RPGs? I was interested in getting this game but your concerns with difficulty is giving me pause. I normally play action RPGs and action games in general on normal and find it to be a good challenge 
    Generally speaking yes. I play most action games and action RPGs on the hardest or next to hardest difficulty. To give an actual example. I beat God of War Ragnarok on the second to hardest difficulty. (The hardest one gave me fits)
