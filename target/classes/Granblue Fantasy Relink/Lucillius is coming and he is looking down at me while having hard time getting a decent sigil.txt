[[Lucillius is coming and he is looking down at me while having hard time getting a decent sigil]]


Few days left before the next update! 


I just noticed the stitch marks around Lucilius' neck. As a person who doesn't know anything about him: *Was my boy beheaded before???*
    Yeah, he was beheaded and the guy who beheaded him got beheaded and then Cilius‚Äô head was attached to the other person‚Äôs beheaded body.
        That's fking metal
        Is that a fucking JoJo reference?
    As a person who *kinda* knows a bit about him (played Vs and seen some discussion on Lucilious)

Lucilious is an Astral, and a scientist. One day he decided to create a clone of himself, called Lucifer. After realizing Lucilious' plans to destroy the world, Lucifer betrayed him and decapitated Lucilious before sealing him away.

Time later, Beelzebub killed Lucifer and broke the seal, then Lucilious went on to use Lucifer's body

(TL:DR Jojo part 1)
    Ehh pretty much yes. Lucilius is a astral that got killed milenia ago by lucifer (his own creation) lucifer is the primarch of the arch angels aka the big chef and hes the equal of bahamuth in power well the bahamuth we know of at least. And after some story plots Lucilius got back from the death with help of another astral that managed to kill lucifer and behead him and put Lucilius head on lucifers body.
    Gonna avoid spoiler territory but yeah only his head was preserved from when he died.
Siero in real life: for 2.99 i can give you one war elemental.
    Anybody that would say Sierokarte wouldn't do this hasn't been in gbf long enough to know she absolutely would in a heartbeat for anyone she took a shine to.
Faa: Tukweitun, shut that bird up!
Truly a sugoi moment.
I'll trade your 2 of my war elemental sigils for a supplementary damage v+ with uplift/cascade/quick cooldown.
    I also need supp damage v+ loool
I'm on the "maybe he'll drop Supp V+" hopium atm,  farming curios is a pain in the ass, AFK or not.
So glad I never have to hear the damn parrot .. bless the mod
    Im literally vibing and pressing my mouse buttons at the right time for a decent beat. Makes it worth xD
        Lmfao yeah no I'm good that sounds like a coping mechanism üíÄ
Honestly, I don't mind the sigil system much.

&#x200B;

What I mind is that rolling for them is garbage. How do we have an experienced Gacha game name that doesn't know how to do Multi rolls?
    This.  How did they screw up the mechanics of rolling so much...
sadly you will be able to buy war elemental sigil with real life cash. I got 4 war elemental sigil so far in my curios. 230h clocked in so far.
    It's really not that bad of a problem. Now if it was supp V/V+ then it would be. It's to help the very unlucky ppl out there, I'm still buying all the packs just cause they're cheap and it saves me some time from mindlessly farming slimes for a bit üòÇ
Im gonna just go full tank and let people do the rest ü§£
80 hours in and I just got my first war elemental. I sti have zero sup dmgs tho. Keep grinding brother üó£Ô∏è
    160 and 3 War elementals, no sup dmg xD i feel your pain
        Is one better than the other. Or are they just both highly coveted?
            Sup dmg is the chance to get 20% of your dmg after the dmg calculation so you deal 50k dmg and 10k extra so you del 50k and 10k seperated. So it works around the dmg cap. War Elemental gives you the power of every element so you have 20% dmg on top always. So you get 20% dmg that ignores the dmg cap from both, BUT you have a chance on sub and guarantee on War element.
stupid question but war elemental helpful against luci? üò≠üò≠ im s2pd
    War Elemental applies to non-elemental opponents but the numbers won't be yellow.

Has been confirmed from tests on the training dummy.
    I heard his wings has the dark element
        oh okii thankies ill bring the sigil along and good luck with your relics hope you get it soon ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
You can't get War Elemental from Siero...
    Thats why I put Appraisal at the right üòÖ
No longer need to beg to that guy for war elementals yassss
Enh just buy it.¬†
Yeah, he was beheaded and the guy who beheaded him got beheaded and then Cilius‚Äô head was attached to the other person‚Äôs beheaded body.
