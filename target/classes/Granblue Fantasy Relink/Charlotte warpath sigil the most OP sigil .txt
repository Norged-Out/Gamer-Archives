[[Charlotte warpath sigil the most OP sigil ]]


So after trying Rakham, Tweyen , charlotte warpath sigils on test dummy to buy 1 for now. I found Charlotte warpath sigil to be most broken, it completely changes her playstyle. Always in noble stance, always wl have interruption resistance, and press Y again and again wl trigger her damage invulnerability if she gets hit. Am I crazy or devs were drunk while creating this sigil. She was top tier before patch, hence there were no character buffs for her this patch. But this sigil makes her one of the most OP character borderline broken.

Let me know if there is any other warpath sigil as OP as her. I believe katalina is also a good team support sigil.


Noble stance
-> Noble strategy
-> Noble stance
-> Noble strategy
-> Noble stance ....

Dmg incoming?
-> Noble strategy out of danger
-> NOBLE STANCE

Enemies running away?
-> Noble chase
-> NOBLE STANCE

Result:
- S++
- Guarantee MVP
    Very Noble of her

The sigil also removed like half of her kit lol, your aa spamming string, invincible skill and skill usage to reenter noble stance doesn't matter now as you spend like 80% of the time being invincible in noble stance, at least this make valiant stance has some actual usage but that about it. As a charlotta main, kinda awkward to see literally no drawback in her kit now after this sigil.
    Yeah I'm still going to spam the aa because it feels more fun
    I mean, all it did is make Charlotta's non-dps skills more viable.

Generally now you run holy ladder/shining onslaught/valiant stance/invincible. 2 attacking skills as a fail safe to enter noble stance right away, and the attack buff (that requires not getting hit) and the skill that helps you not get hit for 15 seconds. Now you just get to lunge more often and don't need to run cooldown sigils anymore.

Relying on valiant stance means having to play more perfectly to maintain it. So there is still skill expression for Charlotta.
    To be fair, the draw of Charlotta has always been spamming attacks in Noble Stance or Beyblading with Noble Strategy. Her skills were always just a means to go into Noble Stance quicker. The warpath simply made spamming both Noble Stance and Noble Strategy stronger while "trimming the fat."

Yeah, it is too much. Right now you can literally clear missions with highest DPS using only 2 buttons. Who needs to walk when spinning is faster.

They should have made it so that she only remains in noble stance after a successful parry and instead of a permanent 10% enhanced dmg to noble stance it should be like a 15 sec 30% enhanced damage buff after a successful parry. At least this way her gameplay requires more thought and planning.

Io's Warpath is pretty strong, but relies on luck to trigger. 50% chance to not consume orbs and +enhanced damage. But ya, Charlotta's absolutely broken. Won't surprise me if it gets changed next patch.


Katalina's good too, but she's already very sigil space starved because she needs so much orange sigils due to her skill damage cap.
Very Noble of her
