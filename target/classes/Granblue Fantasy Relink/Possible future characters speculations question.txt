[[Possible future characters speculations question]]


So after taking look at the GBSVR that fighting game I found out these characters.

But unfortunately I am not really familiar with the lore, so how likely will these characters be implemented in RELINK?

So as far as I know the story of RELINK is set on quite earlier stage of the GBF story, but that’s all it. After all GBFs world is far greater than I thought…


Well the third one (Rein) isn't happening. She's a Versus-exclusive character and represents some lore stuff that they absolutely won't get into in a game like this.

The rest are decently possible as they're all popular but personally, I want characters who didn't already make it into Versus. The rosters are too similar already.
    What's the lore with Rein?
        >!She's the Captain's mother.!<
            Damn that's interesting.
    Agreed, aside from the society that I feel like has to complete with LIsa and Beatrix, the rest can be more different.
        Frankly I'd rather we add other characters who have modest to high popularity then trying to complete sets of characters.

I imagine we'll see Sandalphon eventually, probably 1-2 Evokers to match our Eternal reps (who, is anyone's guess though Nier is probably going to exist due to popularity), some zodiac general, probably see Yuel for a tailed Erune rep if only because of Versus, Zooey will probably also make it in because she's popular and fairly different from most reps due to being a primal.

As far as slightly more out there picks.

Sturm, Drang, Monika (because Lecia is not allowed to exist even if she makes more sense here), Jeanne, maybe Albert, and I'd also like to see Naoise personally but I'm not sure how many characters they want to add and Naoise isn't that super popular even if he is part of a fairly large event sub arc.
            If we do get a Evoker rep I hope it's Fraux honestly, just for the lack of Erune and Fist characters.
                Fraux has probably one of the better chances for sure. I can see her or Lobelia very equally possible unless Cygames wants to put a Harvin in like they did when they picked Uno/Anre in Versus.
            I must admit I have some personal favor toward the rest of society members not only they’re waifuable but there could be more interesting interactions. 

I was shocked the other day finding how much unique dialogues this game have among characters, like literally the knights each have four to five unique interactions between them, the “Wang Chan” really chocked me hard. So that’s why I kinda want to see they complete the society.
                I mean Sturm and Drang are a duo and have plenty of banter (Drang also has ties to Ferry), there's plenty of other duos you can have too like Albert/Yurius, Naoise/Scathacha/Seruel/Heles in some combination, Monika/Lecia if Cygames feels like being especially daring.

There's plenty of fun interactions to be had, especially given that Cygames might just always release in duos which makes combinations like this easier to release.
                    Grea / Anne

Yuel / Socie

Mari / Meg
                    Well it could be possible that we get the likes of Strum and Drang in a future update perhaps since the two of them are seen in the backround of Ferry's second Fate episode in Relink.
                        Do they have in game model or was just mentioned?
                            Sturm was mentioned as "that man who gave her a familiar sounding name" and that's all. No models for either and no actual mention of Sturm.
                                Check the reddit topic in this sub titled 2 guests in Ferry fate episode, we see the two characters in the backround, although it's unclear if they are in 2D or 3D.
                    True, as a Seiyuu fan I am incredibly satisfied with how many interactions there are, like every characters all have special lines with everyone…if this is the case only for Gran I mean it’s normal but Cy did it for everyone, EVERYONE. 

I do love to see more DUOs coming, it’s just part of my personal taste to have a full four society team 
, so there might be an interesting chain burst line, like you know the four knights have one.  

The only problem I have with this game is I can’t pay more XD don’t wanna buy the color pack
            I'm praying for Lobelia for the Evoker slot. One of them. Fairly popular. And his fighting style would be such a banger here. Plus Tower would easily make a flashy entrance and work for an SBA.
                My guess is either Lobelia or Fraux if we're going two beyond Nier. The rest I think are just not very popular or stand out enough. Maybe Geisonborger, because that man would be very interesting to translate into Relink though we probably have enough male draphs for now.
                    Maybe I just am an unapologetic Lobelia simp. And I'd like to see him featured for once. Since he'll never outshine Caim in the base game.
            i'm sorry if it's a dumb question, i'm new to the granblue universe, Jeanne is an original character or it is a collab with Fate ? She is very similiar to Jeanne D'arc from Fate series...
                Its a different version of Jeanne D'arc based on the actual person, there's even a J-Alter version here. They're kind of similar, but Granblue also literally has a Romeo and Juliet and they got guardian spirits because sure.
                    Oooo thanks for that!!! I need to go search for the series Lore.
                She is originally from Rage of Bahamut and she can also be found in Shadowverse and Draglia Lost. She is one of their more iconic characters. In GBF she is a saint of Bahamut who is given the mission of combat Otherworlder intrusions. 

She is also a prominent character in the Rage of Bahamut: Genesis anime.
            Oh yes, Monika please!
        Honestly I'm good with just Zeta and Vaseraga for the Society. I like Eustace, Bea, and Ilsa more than the Dragon Knights but there's no reason to try and compete with them when the DKs are overrepresented enough as it is.

Move on and do the Zodiac Generals or the Horoscopes or something else that isn't already overrepresented in Versus.
            The game is ultimately a fanservice for fans who have been waiting for their favorite characters in this type of game. It's nice to have 'representation' or w/e but they still have shit to sell.
                Well my point is that there are other popular groups who have no playable characters and those should take priority over the popular groups who *do*.

They can absolutely sell Vikala, Fediel, or Sandalphon to more people than Beatrix or Ilsa.
                Yeah and they could sell units with Albert, Anne, Grea, Heles etc also since they are one of the more popular units they have. 

Hell Grea/Anne is prominent in *several* of their franchises and even got a stand alone anime about them.
            Yeah 2 is enough, I already think all 4 of the DKs was honestly a mistake, probably one of my biggest complaints since there is so many groups who don't even have one representative yet.

No Yuel/Socie/You/Kou, Heles/Naoise/Scathacha/Seruel, Albert/Minnah/Yurius, Lecia/Monika, Evoker, Vintage weapon user, Grea/Anne and probably some other group I am forgetting about.
    As someone who doesn't playing fighting games, I just want the best characters in Relink. I don't care if they're in Versus or not.
        It doesn't have to be either/or.

Plenty of great characters who aren't in Versus and would be great in Relink.
I think the biggest constraint to 'Is this character going to be in?' is how close their gameplay might feel to someone else's. 

For example, I'd love to see Eustace in the game, but he might be too close to Eugen gameplay-wise. Ilsa/Tien with Rackam, Six/Yuel with Lancelot/Yoda etc. 

I think we could use a true puppet character like Nier and I also think a Spear/Polearm user is also missing (like Poseidon or THE MAD CYCLONE) since Zeta is mostly about the whole Air Loops rather than actual polearm fighting. I'd also love to see a Mage that doesn't revolve around Charging mechanics, but that might be hard to implement.
    A mage that works similar to Gran with resource spending/building could work but I don't know the gacha game to know if any exist.
        I just would like to see a male mage. We have two female already.
    Give me Threo as a switch axe character. I wouldn't care who else gets included.
    I wonder what are the odds of getting Nezha as a spear character
    Seox would not be similar to either of them
He'd be a melee character, and we could get a dedicated parry button for his specialty like the one Zeta has
It would be awesome if we got Beatrix in the game, she would be great in Relink

Versus aside, i'd love seeing Feather in Relink since his master Ghandagoza is in the game already, and I would love seeing a fast-paced fist fighter in the game.

But you know what i want the most in relink? Sandalphon, I feel like he's really fitting for Relink, he's very popular, and Lucilius is coming to Relink too, so Sandalphon in Relink would be perfect.
    Looks like Sandalphon is literally killing every polling, just curious what makes him so popular? 

I’d love to see LIsa and Beatrix made into game so we can see more interactions between them. Like we got all four knights, then why not all society?
        Sandy is main chara in best event series in main game and Lucillius(next raid boss in relink) is his main enemy so it makes sense to add Sandalphon as playable chara for that imo
            Since Lucilliua is coming to the game as a hardcored boss as advertised, I don’t know if Sandy, this archangel with a equivalent power, will be on our ship…

Maybe he would be an assist like Rolan?
                Sandalphon is kinda equivalent to Lucilius, but even if he was added, he wouldn't be the strongest on our ship. That role will almost always go to the captain or Seofon, as those two are *absurdly* powerful.
            Hopefully, but come on, look at versus, 2 Belial, Beelze, Lucilius, but no Sandy xD
        Sandalphon is one of the small handful of GBF characters who has a very long arc and was an important part of the first major anniversary event series. Its pretty good, albeit a little standard anime stuff like most GBF characters. He's also pretty important in-lore, he's part of the whole Astral stuff that Relink's plot briefly talks about, and Narmaya's JP voice actress comically adores him.

Also Lucilius is coming to Relink and he is one of Sandalphon's major enemies alongside Belial.
            I am kinda worried about the power issue cuz since he’s so powerful, isn’t making him a playable character downplayed his strength a bit? Like get insta killed by two goblins lol
                Seofon (who's coming in April) if he "fully tries" and depending on the timeline (don't ask) is effectively a cosmic threat. In fact all the Eternals can be quite dangerous if fully left unchecked, but Seofon especially is dangerous.

Zeta and Vaseraga fought off a moon alien invasion full of giant robots.

>!Id!< is also quite powerful given their connection to >!Bahamut!<

Captain/Gran/Djeeta/Danchou with Lyria can summon Proto Bahamut who beyond Lyria's stamina issues can in-theory just kill any island with enough time, Bahamut is effectively the life and death cycle of the universe personified in a big kaiju dragon. Proto is a fraction of that power.

The power scaling in GBF goes from "Some old former master swordsman who fishes" to "I am a cosmic level threat to the world"

Don't over think it.
                    Hah Yoda isn't even close to the floor for power scaling either thanks to all the SR and R characters you also have someone's grandma that makes crackers for everyone, a single mom looking for shopping bargains, various children pretending to be heroes or ninjas, and of course a child who isn't even dumb enough to be brave and just sits there terrified holding a knife but not attacking.
                        I just forget the SR/R characters exist because Cygames doesn't do anything with them until they get the SSR treatment like Juri. But I used Yoda simply because he's actually in this game so people here will know him and he's fairly low key compared to even many SSRs given we got "infused by (probably) draconic powers", or "super caster person", or "I'm the biggest giga chad of my kingdom" levels of clout being part of the many many SSR GBF characters without even factoring things like Primal Beasts and what not. I think the only characters I can think of who are notably lower would be like Tsubasa/Sho with their casual over the top motorcycles or magical musician characters like Selfira.
                            Hmm for SSR characters realistically at the bottom ranks I would also consider Herja, Jin, Volenna, and Juri as melee fighters who are probably better than anyone they know before they joined the crew, but don't offer any magical or other powers beyond that to compete with the real powerhouses. ...but the real hot take is that Vane belongs in that group too lol.
                                Yeah Vane is pretty much the worst Dragon Knight power scaling wise by design, its to obviously contrast him with Lancelot. I forgot Herja even existed as an SSR because she was so terrible lol.
                            Uh, anytime we see Yoda lately in the gacha he's seen butting heads with Aletheia or Yngwie for old times' sake and their fighting causes earthquakes across whatever poor island they're on.
                Seofon is being added and he is one of the most powerful characters in the lore. People won't mind so long as their favourite is in.
                Considering they are adding Seofon who is top tier in the verse, I don't think that would be an issue.
        To add onto what other people said Sandalphon is the ultimate "Writers bumble into a well written character" When Sandal was first introduced the writers intended for him to be a villain that was seen as too far gone and hatable despite his pitiable nature. The playerbase (particularly the female playerbase which really established itself with this event) immediately fell in love with him and talked about how they wish he could come back.

So writers at cygames decided they would make What Makes the Sky Blue Part 2. This time (and note they literally said this on stage) they set out to make a truly unredeemable monster that is just "the worst" and made Belial thinking that he would be so gross no one would love him. Instead the fanbase as a whole basically went "Spit in my face and call me slurs belial!" 

Cygames decided to just stick with the plan this time instead of doubling down. Though I like to think the experience gave them more handsome absolute monsters. Only one of them would truly ever be seen as such lol.
        He likes coffee
        He's a meme in the community. Narmaya's JP VA [fangirls](https://youtu.be/nA37oS2xXDs?si=oWBZF3S17GVc026c) over him every time he is mentioned in the convention news.

Though I agree with your opinions on adding Society members. Though I'd also want Zodiac or Evokers if they add more "faction" based characters.
            I didn’t know that XD MAO sang is truly a treasure.

Zodiac and Evokers are quite popular as I heard of, their weapons look interesting too. In fact I saw a Japanese site claiming that they would be likely be introduced to the game. 

今後のアップデートで追加が予想されるキャラ on games8 is where I found the info.
        I'm also new to Granblue, but from what I understand Sandalphon is an EXTREMELY powerful, archangel-like primal beast who inherited the will of Lucifer, one of the First primal beasts and more or less the God of the skies that Granblue takes place in.

Each of his wings represents a different element, and he has 6 of them. Fire, wind, earth, light, darkness, and water.

That's all I know about him so far, but he has very quickly become my most wanted character for both Versus rising and relink.
            He took the mantle of Supreme Primarch after Lucifer's death, and has been tried so far to redeem himself from his past sins by trying to look over the skies like Lucifer had done.
        He's popular due to his role in the What Makes the Sky Blue trilogy I think, which I only watched part 1, but will try to read part 2 and 3 when i have the chance.
        Great development (started out as a villain and got an amazing redemption arc), funny interactions with the crew and he is hot. Oh and he is basically the MC of the most popular arc in the gacha.
    Does Randall have a master too?
Who’s the Paladin character using sword and shield? I need her in the game asap!
    That's Zooey, she's in Versus. Pretty popular character so she'll probably make it in.
        That’s good to know! I love Vane as my AI tank but Zooey here looks like one I would like to play myself.
            Zoi gameplay wise has never been really a tank in the way you'd expect. Her normal light version which is what is featured in the art there is actually a dodge tank with a heavy emphasis on dodging and getting a nuke as a result of dodging (remember gbf mobile is basically turn based final fantasy). 

Dark zoi is the breaker of balance and will likely never be acknowledged by cygames again. She has a skill that takes your teams hp to 1, gives them invincible for a turn and a very high healing cap drain. She single handedly broke the meta in such a ridiculous way the next two years of content were made in such a way to prevent her use.

I've been joking that if she comes to relink they'll give her the skill and it will break relink balance in the same way lol.
                > Dark zoi is the breaker of balance

Its funny because Dark Zooey is actually not even that good anymore which says many things about the state of the Dark Element, and it has little to do with the content denying her and more to do with how insane dark is as an element.

I don't think Conjunction if they translated into Relink would be that crazy in this game, it was broken in OG GBF because enmity was one of the easiest ways to hit damage cap thresholds and Garrison made dying difficult. But Relink's caps are easy to hit with any reasonable build and everything that can kill you does practically one shot damage so garrison synergy is irrelevant. It'd probably be like a marginally better Vane Rampart or Katalina Enhanced Invincible buff at best, which is very good but not that out of line.
                    I don't think she would be good in any element regardless really. Conjunction bot is just not good enough any more since all elements got better healing, better defensive buttons and the enmity isn't really a thing any more, you simply don't need the raw attack power of being at 1hp.
                Ah, I see. Thanks for the breakdown.
                She was so broken that despite her being a summer unit they re-classified her as a grand unit.
        She would be more likely to make it in as a boss.
    I don't think there is Paladin who uses a sword and shield. 

''Paladin'' as an archetype isn't seen in GBF really. Except Charlotta's knight order I guess.
        [Actually.....](https://gbf.wiki/Paladin)
            You miss baotorda
            I guess that is true.
Give me [Nicholas](https://gbf.wiki/images/7/71/Npc_zoom_3040315000_02.png) so I can smite my enemies with giant robot fists!!!!!
    Who cares about his Robot Fists? He's a Kamen Rider! I wanna kick the shit out of people!
    Nicholas and Robomi too pls
imo Nier or any of the Evokers aren't likely unless we get an adaptation of [The World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2Ja-W0cj2I&t=60s) raid, since their existence is heavily tied into the existence of the Arcarum, which The World created.

Characters from Society are probably likely since we have Pyet-A, an automagod which is heavily involved in their story. Though to be honest I'd rather have [Cassius](https://gbf.wiki/Cassius_(Event_SSR)) who is an important character in event stories involving the Moon which includes those characters.

Fun picks imo would be:

* [Societte](https://gbf.wiki/Societte_(Fire)), with Yuel being a side character in her CA just as a nod to her appearance in GBVS.
* [Naoise](https://gbf.wiki/Naoise_(Fire)), [Seruel](https://gbf.wiki/Seruel), [Heles](https://gbf.wiki/Heles), or [Scathacha](https://gbf.wiki/Scathacha). All important characters to the [Irestill Kingdom series](https://gbf.wiki/Hero%27s_Return) which hasn't gotten any representation in either game. Scathacha or Naoise would probably be most likely lore wise, Heles if we're going based solely on popularity.
* [Aliza](https://gbf.wiki/Aliza) and [Stan](https://gbf.wiki/Stan_(Event)). I loved their Side Stories and seeing the two lovebirds interact in-game would be sweet.
* Any of the Divine Generals. [Vajra](https://gbf.wiki/Vajra) and [Kumbhira](https://gbf.wiki/Kumbhira) are probably the more interesting to adapt into the game, but I'll be honest and say [Vikala](https://gbf.wiki/Vikala) is more likely due to popularity,
* [Golden Knight](https://gbf.wiki/Golden_Knight), since she's important to the more recent releases of main story.
* Since Metera was planned but had to be reworked into Tweyen, [Sutera](https://gbf.wiki/Sutera_(SSR)) (Metera's younger sister) makes a good pick (I have no clue why they didn't pick her).
* Literally any Harp specialty character. [Aoidos](https://gbf.wiki/Aoidos) (look up the Unfinished Melody album) or [Baal](https://gbf.wiki/Baal) world probably work here. [Niyon](https://gbf.wiki/Niyon) of the Eternals would too.
    >imo Nier or any of the Evokers aren't likely unless we get an adaptation of The World raid, since their existence is heavily tied into the existence of the Arcarum, which The World created.

They already stated that Lucilius raid is coming without story, so they can also add Nier without Arcarum storyline.
        I was thinking of Raids being additions to the story, while characters added should be related to content in game. Like since Lucilius is added that means they could adapt the Belial and Beelzebub raids or add Sandalphon or the Primarchs as playable characters. I'd love to see Evokers added, but I'd want content related to their story added first or alongside them like The World or an Arcarum/Replicard Sandbox style gamemode, that way newer players can have a sort of stepping stone to exploring more of the lore behind them. Like how Zeta and Vaseraga are good additions, but if the Pyet-A boss didn't exist I'd find it hard to justify them being in game when they're already in Versus.
    Yeah no story doesn't matter, half the cast is literally just there with only fate episodes barely scratching the surface of their story, they dont need to add anything for evokers just like they aren't adding anything for eternals.
With a roster of 400+ characters.. man there's so much better they could pull from than the ones that ended up in Rising.
    Both this game and Rising suffer from the problem that they've been in development for a while so all of the characters are from the first two years of GBF's life so the options are limited to the same small pool.

Rising was doing better with Nier and Grimnir but then went right back into it with fucking Vane and Beatrix (I love them, don't get me wrong but they're pretty basic choices)

Like where's Meg? Where's Vikala? Where are the Six Dragons?
        Personally I'm sick of bow much they already push vikala, I'd rather a different zodiac character got in like Vajra or Makura. The six dragons would unpack a whole chunk of lore that I don't think relink really wants to get in too.
            Oh agreed, Kumbhira is my preferred choice of the Zodiacs. I only said Vikala because she's the most popular.

And I think you can probably swing one of the Six Dragons if you focus on their individual aspects over their overarching lore.
                I suppose when thinking about their lore, since this is a different timeline to the gacha game. Are the 6 dragons the same since their event showed they would be different in other universes even if all the other characters looked the same.
                    As far as we know, that rule only applied to Orologia's simulations.

Alternate universe versions of the Six Dragons have already shown up in other events.
        >Where's Vikala?

In Princess Connect.
    Yup, that’s the benefit of having a great story as backing. However, far as I know the game is set at relatively earlier stage of the main GBF story so probably not 400 but like 100 to choose from. Still huge possibility lies ahead. 

Besides, comparing to risings you are also have a benefit of playing pretty much like a gacha game but the waifus and husbandos no needed to be gachaed. 

Rising is also a great game but I just enjoyed RELINK a little bit more: more anime graphics, easier boss fights (rising sometime is just too hard for me) with better visuals: dude the proto Bahamut fight is pleasing to watch and be part of it.
        Don't think continuity really matters for these side stories.
Plus Kat has Ares in Relink, which she only acquired quite late in the main story.
            Oh really? That opens up quite a lot possibilities
                Ya the Ares thing is funny because it happens like 100ish chapters after when this story is supposed to happen.
I feel like Vira is an inevitability
I think Vira is almost guaranteed to be in at some point. Her VA is a very prominent figure in their japanese streams, and that's a massive factor on how they tend to choose the characters. Not to mention people love her for her obssesion with Katalina.

Nier is also another one that might be almost guaranteed to be in due to being one of the most popular girls in the game alongside Vikala, but who knows, maybe they pick Lobelia and Hasselia instead for the Evoker choice, or even Alanaan.

Bea probably, but something tells me they will choose Ilsa and Cassius for more Society representatives.

Sandalphon is guaranteed at some point.

I kinda wanna see a really rare pick at some point, someone like Walder would be awesome, he is everyones first gacha character in the mobage afterall, or maybe Rosamia, she was my first SSR. Jeanne is someone I'm surprised hasn't appeared in either game, she is one of Cygames faces from back in the day, and is still really popular among the fanbase. Her summer version broke the game when she released lol.
Outside of Maglielle/Gallanza

&#x200B;

Danua/Mahira

Heck, any non-human characters(we'll have 15 humans(including male/female captain) come April)
*crying and kicking and screaming* LOWAIN! LOWAIN! LOWAIN!
    Joker character + mechanic involving tag team.

EZ pick.
I really want to see more underrepresented characters from the gacha, not characters that already got in versus
I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if Beatrix was in the May update for Relink since that’s when she’s releasing in Versus. Seems like they are keeping the rosters kind of similar to each other. We need more of the other races imo though.
    Yup, it is plausible that they have Aya Hirano voice Beatrix in two games at the same time cuz she’s probably busy with her work…
    We’ll see in March what would they bring
    To be honest if they add Beatrix they'd probably add Eustace  as well. Which I'd be in favour of as it is weird we have no male erune.
Aliza for the fire draph kick chick.  
Baotarda for another Lumiel knight that is a proper board and sword.
Beatrix is already coming to Rising so doubt she'd get into Relink aswell.

Nier is unlikely given how Death works, also.shes in Rising.

Rein is a Rising exclusive character.

Zooey is the only one here I could see be somewhat possible.

Soriz, well, we already have Ghandagoza so doubtful.

Vira is 100% not gonna be in Relink since Id has her weapons.


Personally I want to see Feather, Drang, Nezha, Baal or my absolute most wanted, Lobelia.
    We do have Ghanda, but we also have Eugen and there's probably some long time GBF fans who wants at least a Soiya duo of Soriz and Eugen. You can make Soriz pretty different from Ghanda if you try, he's got a fairly distinct skill set from him.
        In that case I'd prefer getting Jin
            I probably would too, but Cygames needs to remember Jin exists ~~and give him an SSR that isn't terrible~~.
    I genuinely hope Beatrix will come to RELINK well because she’s coming to RELINK with Vane
    Baal, and any harp characters really, would be funny to see gameplay wise. I imagine in a coop fight everyone would be fighting all serious and then this one weirdo is just rocking the guitar in the middle of the arena
    >Rein is a Rising exclusive character.

And Bubs was planned as Versus OC character, but he got into main gacha game. So I don't think it matters that much.
        Source.
I want Aliza so bad to complete my OG fire team from the main game but there's no way she gets added when we already have a fire Draph Monk character
    You say that but wind is literally going to be only 3 male swordsman with Seofon's release.
        Seofon isn't a swordsman tho
            Yes he is. He's just more of a magic swordsman instead of a traditional one.
I am hoping for yuel and sosiete / grea and Ann / monika and Lecia
    1 up for monika and Lecia, they deserve more love
Europa please or any of the music characters
I just want a mage guy. Is there even any ? Closest we have is Rolan but he isn't playable.
    It is possible that Rolan will become a playable character since he’s got the model and everything ready. 

Tho I doubt he’ll be a mage focus guy…maybe like a magus from pathfinder? You use magic and sword at the same time? 

There’re a lot more mages looking dude, including a Gandalf looking one and a lot more.
    There are some male mages in GBF that are popular enough to become playable, such as: Drang (magic balls as weapon,>!the great grandchild of Ferry's little sister!<), water) Elmott (fire magic user, staff), Sarunan (light/dark, staff), Noa (light primal, a paddle as weapon, but I doubt if they'll add Primal to the game). 

Alanaan and Estarriola are also fairly famous but I don't think any Evokers will be added soon, lore-wise...
I don't care what it is I just want MORE of this game!!! :)
I've always thought Vira is going to be playable from the start.....

If they ever plan adding more character beside Song(Tweyen) & Siete(Seofon). Really hope they'd make Vira playable in the future, I really like her.

As for your list, the only unlikely going to be added is Rain, as she's gbf versus story exclusive character. While the other is probably have a chance.
I just want Roland to be playable soon tbh. His playstyle is only featured for a little as guest character, but I love his shooting beams from floating magic circles, so cool. The same with Historiath and other Relink-only characters.

And since there's still no harp users in game, I'd love to see some playable soon: Anthuria (can she be counted as harp user? she's dancer), Mahira, Niyon, Selfira, Caro...
I'm actually super surprised Yuel or Beatrix were not in GBF relink for how popular they were in mobile.

Actually the relink roster imo was pretty bland compared to the characters that exsist in GBF.

Nezahualpilli would have been awesome so would have Feena or Grea.

Strum and Drang also kinda surprised were not in it.

Vampy (Vira) is a real shock imo especially since she is obsessed with Katalina
    I’d love to see Vira coming and express her overwhelming “love” toward Kata XD
    Yet Beatrix were so much forgotten by Cygames that the other half (Zeta) got alot of alts and shilled by them. I waited so long for Grand Bea but it seems like Bea popularity have fallen off the charts nowadays. Even it took them so long to tease her in GBVSR.

Would love to see her pre rework clock mechanic in Relink thou.
Man I wouldn’t mind paying more money for more content, this game truly makes me happy.

They could also add 2B since she is in Versus apparently 😏. And/or other collabs characters. 🤷‍♂️
    Same, I don’t mind paying more for dlc characters! At least better than spending on gacha haha
omg for the love of god bring Soriz
I demand more Draph shortstacks >;(
    Aliza should have got Ghanda's spot as a brawler/martial artist T_T
        Dude absolutely, I could see her having a super fast paced playstyle.
I feel like they will have to change a few things to really be able to expand character options. 

For one, I don't necessarily like characters being able to hit damage caps without outside assistance. Many support characters fall off extremely hard in endgame because once you're already capped on your damage, there is no pushing more through buffs/debuffs. I'd like them to raise each characters damage cap while preventing players from simply recapping without assistance from support buffs/debuffs. 

If we can get a change like that, I think it could really open up the road for characters like Korwa, Jeanne, Golden Knight, Black Knight, Zooey, Yuel, and Altair.
    > For one, I don't necessarily like characters being able to hit damage caps without outside assistance

OG GBF already solved this with variable defense stats in harder content, there's pretty much 4-5 (iirc) different relevant defense values in GBF's endgame content and that always dramatically changed how you made your build/team because you need more modifiers and buffs and less cap break based on how high the defense stat was unless your equipment was crazy high.
        And that's the kind of design we need pushing forward. I really do appreciate the people who choose to play support (Looking at you Hunting Horn mains) in these types of games because even though they COULD just unga bunga DPS like every other character, they understand that making other people hit more and get hit less is just as respectable as the guy whos goal is to make sure every breakable part of this boss breaks.
            I think supportive set ups are valuable enough in Relink, Danchou Substitute + Katalina/Vane invincibility is super funny. It just isn't the pure buffer kind. Plus imo being someone like Ferry who generate SBA super fast is a pretty supportive role because you effectively stun lock the boss if you time your stuff right. Like Ferry might as well be an enabling support in practice with how Proto Baha work because she makes sure Baha doesn't fly off so your party can just stomp his face into the floor. That's probably far more important then anything the DPS are actually doing in terms of ensuring the fight goes as smooth as it does.

But I think damage cap is a more interesting system when caps are actually hard to hit, as shown in actual GBF.
                Ask us poor Rosetta players how valid being a support feels...
                    As I said:

> It [support that's valuable] just isn't the pure buffer kind

I know that, but there's still supportive enablers in this game just Rosetta isn't one of them unfortunately.
                        Fair. 'Buffers' have a shitty life. Offensive supports are eating fairly good.
    Yea, the existence of dmg cup making dmg buffs kinda falling hard I do feel that yet that means they have to change the dmg calculation algorithm…
I'd rather we get characters that aren't in Versus yet like Aliza.
    Does everyone here play fighting games or something? I didn't think there was a lot of overlap between them and the RPG genre. Personally I have zero interest in fighting games and will never play one, so I'd rather see the best characters in Relink independent of games of other genres.
        Yeah I don't get the constant call back to versus. This game is evidently way more popular than Versus ever did, it's clear there's a lot of people who don't care about overlapping as long as it's good characters being put in the game.
        There's a good amount of cross over, but many people just want to see characters that haven't been given the chance to be in anything outside of the mobile game. This series has a lot of fan favorites that haven't gotten that chance yet.
We need underrepresented characters, not ones who got to VS. 

The Knights get all four while the Society members, who are very important, only got two. Ilsa, Beatrix and Eustace need in. 

Eternals maybe Six. 

Sandalphon definitely. Most popular character for both men and women.

Why the downvotes
    You say that we should get more characters that aren't in Versus, and then half the characters you want are ones that are (going to be) in Versus...

Edit: And he blocked me lmao
        Figures LMAO
        I didn't say all. I'm just saying we don't need Zoey, Nier, who is only known by the yandere trope, nor do we need another melee. 

I said Eustace and Beatrix because they get very little attention. Seox because he's one of the most popular Eternals with Siete. 

Ilsa has no attention, and yet there's a whole group of knights, don't make me repeat myself. I simply said Eustace and Beatrix to fill Society roster, and as well as did I say every character from VS? No. Good to remind you.

Amazing I'm getting downvoted even though he put words in my mouth. I blocked because of such.
            Yup, I am down with completing the whole society team, besides LIsa is a range character too right? We do need more range characters.

I am also very interesting in what would they say when chain burst ultimate, the four knights got one so why not give the same love to the society?
    Indeed, real gamers want Mukku and Gachapin.
    Eustance and Bea are already in Versus, why would you do the same thing as with the Knights and put them into Relink as well? Same thing as with Six. You're contradicting yourself with your first sentence and your second. It doesn't sound like your issue with it is "underrepresented" characters and rather "characters who got into VS that I don't like as much as other characters who got into VS".

Ilsa getting in would be great since she's not in VS. We do not need the whole group of Society members *again*, and I like the Society members way more than I like the Knights.
    Yea indeed, but I am just wondering how likely they will be in the game because there are a lot of overlap between these two games character wise. I think VS got all the characters we have but more right?

Edits: ah never-mind I checked it out and it looks like we do have four characters that do not show up in VS
    I need my dual pistol twin tien in the game
I don't want another mountain-like punch guy when Ghandagoza fills that niche just fine, and he needs a rework anyways.

If it were some more agile martial artist with kicks and acrobatics rather than a slow falcon punch karate guy, maybe.

We need male casters (we have exactly zero, they're all yappy little girls or some MILF), Drang would also cover the Erune box as we're lacking Erune. 

I want Anre, too, a flying spear-wielding Harvin demon with fabulous facial hair looks great.

I also want them to open up the different classes for the captain like they have in the mobile game.

Narmaya's uncle Eatha also looks great, a Kabuki inspired character who uses hair to swing weapons is very unique.
I also would like to include Lycia and Reinhardtzar, but looks like this sub does not allow me to edit my original post:

https://gbf.wiki/Lecia
    Bold of you to assume they'd let Lecia back in.

Don't get me wrong I love the idea of Lecia joining too but considering how hard they are avoiding that in the main game I got doubts.

Also the Lyria simps might riot again (as far as I'm aware that's what got her exiled from the main story begin with)
My perfect special meow meow yaoi boy sandalphon 

Six dragons would be cool but maybe unlikely (ewiyar lol) although I could see Wilnas or Fediel

Haven't done her event but Gwynne would be cool for relic seeker
Needs more of the lil people. They're the only ones I care about. I wanna be a lil mage.
Ladiva please!
I just want 2B 🥹
    Emmm tbh with you I actually had enough of seeing 2B all the way around. Like literally every gacha game has her if they do collab…

Plus she’s already there in Rising XD

|-|-|-|-|
What's her name?
    Which one? From left to right it goes Beatrix, Nier, Rein, Zooey, Vira.
        Beatrix is pretty
Would love to see Seox in the game. Would totally want to main them if they were.
I would love Beatrix because it would be great to have a character whose kit made Enmity builds actually worth running. Vira would be great for being an install character. Plus they both have A grade VAs.
The one with a shield looks good and well, has a shield so it brings something new. The rest of them dont look too different from what we already have, arent there any characters with a more unique weapon/playstyle?
    Granblue has a lot of weird ass characters a [literal cat](https://gbf.wiki/images/a/a4/Npc_zoom_3040452000_01.png) can be playable if we count for everything that's possible.

That aside, we got characters with [pure draconic power](https://gbf.wiki/images/9/95/Npc_zoom_3040122000_03.png), we got who are far more "traditional" type of polearm users then say Zeta due to being more grounded and [possibly having a shield](https://gbf.wiki/images/5/5b/Npc_zoom_3030096000_01.png), we got a more traditional [big gun sniper character](https://gbf.wiki/images/c/c2/Npc_zoom_3040049000_03.png) then Eugen, we got many [types](https://gbf.wiki/images/e/ec/Npc_zoom_3040119000_02.png) of [casters](https://gbf.wiki/images/d/d4/Npc_zoom_3040011000_03.png) that can [exist](https://gbf.wiki/images/c/cc/Npc_zoom_3040215000_02.png) in the roster, we got a [robo suit man](https://gbf.wiki/images/d/d5/Npc_zoom_3040088000_01.png), we got [girl with a paint gun because sure](https://gbf.wiki/images/4/43/Npc_zoom_3040277000_02.png), and we got a very [literal puppet girl](https://gbf.wiki/images/c/cb/Npc_zoom_3040111000_01.png)

Granblue is fully of whacky characters and skill sets that can have some interesting translations. Because I can pretty firmly tell you most the characters here are actually fairly faithful to some iteration of them in the gacha, almost every skill is some kind of reference somewhere which is why Vane has 3 seemingly redundant buffs because his buffs got progressively different as he got newer versions of himself over the years.
        > and we got a very literal puppet girl

Two actually, Cendrillion is also one.
How many chars can they even fit in this game, its sad all these amazing chars not in the game we will probably just get 1-2 chars every 4-6 months
    It’s an unfortunate thing because how hard the development went and as no commercial expert I do not know if the current sales success recovers the cost and how much will player staying in the game. Yet I do want to keep optimistic: given how much the game is succeed in just twenty days I believe there would be far more contents coming to it than original plan. 

But there is one thing I do know that is I am more than happy to welcome paid character dlcs and more quality contents to be added.

Furthermore, think about it the original GBF today is an ancient game already and still gets quality content and consistent players so there will be more characters coming consistently which doesn’t sound that bad after all.
I need soriz so bad, or at least another punch guy that isnt Ghandagoza
Zooey, Grimnir, and Vita are damn near guaranteed. They get added into everything. I know Nier is the most popular evoker, but I rather see Fraux since she's a melee fighter.

Beatrix and Alexiel I'd really want.
i need zooey to come to relink i have yet to build a good light character and would love for her to be my first that and her gameplay with her dragons could be fun idk about what she did in the mobile game but she's fun in versus
    Right the elements, because I used war elemental all the time almost forgot its existence lol. But yes the game current have uneven number of characters in each element so it is plausible they’ll release more characters to fill the blank: dark have four while others only have like three.
        wind is lacking the most with only the captain and yodarha😭
            Yea, I wish they could release Lecia, but unlikely. What we do know is that one of the new coming ups that swordsman is wind element, the other archer is light.
                oh i definitely would've thought seofen the swordsman to be light and tweyen wind
                We'll probably get Monika before we get Lecia, which is probably fine anyway as Monika has probably better gameplay potential.
                    Ohhh but only if that is going to happen :( I don’t think both of them on any priority.
            Siete is coming for wind at least.
Sarasa
I want the girl with the shield. We need a shield in this game.
So, as many people can guess, all the character from the game (and Versus) comes from the browser  gacha game (which is turning 10 this year), which can be played for free on  on any chrome browser. What's funny, is that Relink was initially announced back in 2016, whereas Versus was announced in 2018. Funny how things turned out.

What's also funny that 90% of the characters  don't actually appear in the main story, rather, they where introduced in [story events](https://gbf.wiki/Events). And the game's fucking old, so with 140+ story events you can guess that the whole roster is becoming kind of big. Not all events feature new characters though, old characters often make guest appearances, and some events are direct sequels to others.

Anyways, the whole list of characters can be found [Here](https://gbf.wiki/All_Characters).

There's also the [Tier List](https://gbf.wiki/Character_Tier_List/Gamewith/Ratings) if you want a better view.

Edit: Also, characters that are not in versus I would like to see in relink: [Alexiel](https://gbf.wiki/Alexiel), [Pholia](https://gbf.wiki/Pholia), [Sturm](https://gbf.wiki/Sturm_(Grand)) and/or [Drang](https://gbf.wiki/Drang_(Grand)), [Feather](https://gbf.wiki/Feather_(SSR)), and [Vikala](https://gbf.wiki/Vikala) for the zodiac representation.
Vira, Zooey, Sandy, Bea and either Eustace/Ilsa for a society team (probably Eustace) are pretty much guaranteed imo.

I feel like Ghanda's taken Soriz's spot in this game. 

So after those it's anyone's guess, but I'm sure they'll want one of the Divine Generals and Evokers in for representation.
    I miss Soriz :( although I don’t know him much but that song really made me laugh hard
        It is worth noting, as I assume most people don't know this in this subreddit, but Granblue has character songs (even with music videos) sung by their JP vas. Soriz's versus theme is based on [his character theme](https://youtu.be/kGs9_LyTJt8) with Eugen and Jin (who isn't in this game and Cygames forgot about probably)
With Lucilius fight coming out soon they must have considered putting in someone from the primarch storyline. Sandalphon is the most likely, but he's another sword user. Belial or Bubs would be great options as well.
Everyday we stray further and further from getting Aliza into either Relink OR Versus Rising. 

She has fans, we’re right here!
Cat Ewiyar please.

I want to see/hear Wind Speed: 222 meows/s
Please no to any of these
I'd like zoe and heles personally
I really want Threo
I'd like Silva but I doubt it would happen, she is reasonably popular but I feel she would play too similar to Eugen. Though could be different in skill set with into hiding, her unique debuff and her charge bar gain support.
    Maybe not too similar? She’s got that giant sniper rifle so maybe she can attack very far range in a safe spot?
        ... So just like Eugen?
            She’s got a huge rifle, like almost taller than herself. Her skill in the original GBF tho is the same as Rackam. You can check her wiki page. https://gbf.wiki/Silva

Tbh she’s probably more like huge dmg one shot type? Maybe charge shooting?
                Eugen has charged shooting and he has a mode called SNIPER VISION with tremendous range. Action game wise they'd be extremely similar.

Not impossible for her to come, but extremely similar base mechanics. I think what makes her not come into relink by a long-shot is the fact they wanna make the face of the franchise, so using chars other people know more (like the GBF Versus ones) is prefferable.

And even if they'd use unknown chars, it would be from factions already on both games (DK, society and etc).
Yes to any characters with a shield that actually makes me feel like a real tank.
Sorez will be added I'm almost 100% sure.
But I'm copeing for Ilsa, Melissabelle, Anila and Lunalu
I hope they take characters more original from the mobile/web game and not just from versus rising.
I've only seen a few of these types of posts but they are female heavy in their hopes. Are there a lot more female characters in gbf?
    There's plenty of males. The reason why most people keep spamming girls is 100% waifuism, regardless of what they claim
        This is what I was assuming
    I do not have the precise number top of my head, but theoretically should be more female characters given its a gacha game. This does not mean they are far more, the reason why there are more female characters mentioned here is because 

1 I like their seiyuu or character designs (not lore because I don’t know much)
2 I just picked some memorable face randomly
3 our game already have some of the most popular males but not most popular females: according to a 2022 polling it looks like we got none of the top popular female characters but some of the male. So I would speculate more on females that are popular but not yet in game. Notes this polling is outdated but still many on the list aren’t showed up in game.

If you are interested you can google GBF 2022 polling.
Tbh I hope I am wrong on this. But didn’t they say the game only gets 3 updates? Lucillius, seofon and tweyen and a third one they didn’t give any information about? 

I don’t think the third update are more characters since they could have said so like with seofon and tweyen and after the third update the game is over 🥺
    Nope they did not say this game will only get three updates, the information I have is that we have a roadmap with unclear paid dlc contents and clear free content updates until April. 

This game would be likely going under continue slow updates unless they announce something big in the coming month March 10th GBF anniversary.
I would prefer literally ANY other evoker than Nier. If they pick one I hope its either Estarriola or Fraux
    I don’t know but did the Evokers debut early in the story or are they added lately? This game seem to have set on earlier journey of the main GBF story line (thou might not)
        > I don’t know but did the Evokers debut early in the story or are they added lately? This game seem to have set on earlier journey of the main GBF story line (thou might not)

Evokers are a few years old, but this stuff is for sure not all recent canon.

For example:

Katalina has Ares

Zeta has various parts of her later plot advancement for her crew's particular arc. Namely anything to do with blasting beams from her spear and flurry raining spears from nowhere using magic. Which that advancement is from 2020.

Vaseraga I'm pretty sure has his own advancements to match Zeta's given we're in post that arc of The Society stuff.

Danchou/Captain/Gran/Djeeta are the Singularity which is something that gets brought up pretty late into the story.

The real catch is that The Evokers, like the Eternals and frankly almost every single character in Granblue Fantasy, are optional things that can happen at any point in the story. Granblue's timeline is literally just spaghetti where everything is canon regardless of what you the player do within it. Which justifies the game having this many characters and about 5-6 different potential cataclysmic disasters all exist in the same space without bumping into each other.
            This is what I was looking for! Thx
Make Gallanza playable you COWARDS
Zero
I would love Vira so much. Im just not sure how she would be much different from Kat. But Zoey would be great. With some type of proper shield mechanics. Id love that as well. Pet/shield class
I really want Soriz or generally more muscular old man
I want Anila bro xD
I need Soriz in this, Ghanda has left me disappointed as a fan of pugalists.
    Yea ghanda is suppose to be some badass but he's kinda lame.
Give me Yuel
I have no idea who any of these are, but if we ever get “angry blonde with dragons and sword/shield” girl I will never play another character.
We need more ranged attackers
A Sniper like [Silva for ranged water class would be nice](https://gbf.wiki/Silva#5.E2.98.85_Art)
I wish they would throw Cain in. saber and pistol would be so much fun
Wait isn't relink after the gbf story? Hence the astras and other terms being present

Also if there's a poll about who'd you like to see in relink posted by cygames, answer that since the devs majority of the time use that as basis rising was a good example of that
    > Wait isn't relink after the gbf story? Hence the astras and other terms being present

Depends on where you define "after", because Granblue's timeline is ultra mega fucky wucky and by design pretty much doesn't make any sense time wise beyond its specific bubbles that define entire arcs. Its multi-timeline fuckery where everything that has ever happened is canon at once no matter if it makes sense or not as long as it exists in the setting.

Astrals as a concept have been a thing for a very long time, since 2014 even and What Makes The Sky Blue 1 was when we started getting that more high concept stuff show up more often and that is from 2017 I believe.
Magisa? Lol 

I’m gonna be I want Grimnir or any DL rep
    I mean another mage character would be nice
        I would pay incredible money to get a Notte skin for Vyrn.
There should be a law wherre if you add zeta you must add bea. How is she still not in gbvs and relink?
I don’t think they’re adding any primals to relink
Yuel, need more Erunes and I feel like she would fit well in Relink, maybe something similar to Lancelot?
I definitely want Soriz added as a speedier hand-to-hand alternative to the slower Ghandagoza
I keep thinking this is the versus sub and I looked at this post with so much confusion and maybe a little bit of anger
I would like to see Geisenborger or Maria Theresa
The first or fifth one cause they got cool swords
I Hope they continue to add characters that aren't already in versus/Rising as DLC like Seofon and Tweyen.
Wishing for Albert, Lecia, Khumbira, Monika, Lily and Cain
Gold Knight pls. I also feel we need more mages. Like long range mages.
What are the odds of Niyon making it in? I never touched the og gacha game but she is cute
Add Jeanne.
I think they're more likely to use more of their popular main-line cast than Versus characters. They have a huge cast to choose from to add (more potatoes) variety to the game.
Let me get my Cinnamon roll Zooey! I would max level her asap.
Still no lucky enough to fully upgrade my main character.

And to go tru all of that again hahahahahaa

I will stick with Vaseraga
I just want Seox
I need my boy...
They're (possibly) giving us Yuel, and that'd be a THIRD dual wielding character, but we only have one melee character and I'm pretty sure Ghandagoza is the least used character in the roster
Give us our cat man, Cygames, please
I don't wanna play Versus to see him do cool shit, I suck at that game lmao
im willing to bet we getting an Evoker next.
All they should do is, add Yuel and You. What is a game without super cute fox girls with giant ears anyways?
What's the lore with Rein?
    >!She's the Captain's mother.!<
        Damn that's interesting.
Agreed, aside from the society that I feel like has to complete with LIsa and Beatrix, the rest can be more different.
    Frankly I'd rather we add other characters who have modest to high popularity then trying to complete sets of characters.

I imagine we'll see Sandalphon eventually, probably 1-2 Evokers to match our Eternal reps (who, is anyone's guess though Nier is probably going to exist due to popularity), some zodiac general, probably see Yuel for a tailed Erune rep if only because of Versus, Zooey will probably also make it in because she's popular and fairly different from most reps due to being a primal.

As far as slightly more out there picks.

Sturm, Drang, Monika (because Lecia is not allowed to exist even if she makes more sense here), Jeanne, maybe Albert, and I'd also like to see Naoise personally but I'm not sure how many characters they want to add and Naoise isn't that super popular even if he is part of a fairly large event sub arc.
        If we do get a Evoker rep I hope it's Fraux honestly, just for the lack of Erune and Fist characters.
            Fraux has probably one of the better chances for sure. I can see her or Lobelia very equally possible unless Cygames wants to put a Harvin in like they did when they picked Uno/Anre in Versus.
        I must admit I have some personal favor toward the rest of society members not only they’re waifuable but there could be more interesting interactions. 

I was shocked the other day finding how much unique dialogues this game have among characters, like literally the knights each have four to five unique interactions between them, the “Wang Chan” really chocked me hard. So that’s why I kinda want to see they complete the society.
            I mean Sturm and Drang are a duo and have plenty of banter (Drang also has ties to Ferry), there's plenty of other duos you can have too like Albert/Yurius, Naoise/Scathacha/Seruel/Heles in some combination, Monika/Lecia if Cygames feels like being especially daring.

There's plenty of fun interactions to be had, especially given that Cygames might just always release in duos which makes combinations like this easier to release.
                Grea / Anne

Yuel / Socie

Mari / Meg
                Well it could be possible that we get the likes of Strum and Drang in a future update perhaps since the two of them are seen in the backround of Ferry's second Fate episode in Relink.
                    Do they have in game model or was just mentioned?
                        Sturm was mentioned as "that man who gave her a familiar sounding name" and that's all. No models for either and no actual mention of Sturm.
                            Check the reddit topic in this sub titled 2 guests in Ferry fate episode, we see the two characters in the backround, although it's unclear if they are in 2D or 3D.
                True, as a Seiyuu fan I am incredibly satisfied with how many interactions there are, like every characters all have special lines with everyone…if this is the case only for Gran I mean it’s normal but Cy did it for everyone, EVERYONE. 

I do love to see more DUOs coming, it’s just part of my personal taste to have a full four society team 
, so there might be an interesting chain burst line, like you know the four knights have one.  

The only problem I have with this game is I can’t pay more XD don’t wanna buy the color pack
        I'm praying for Lobelia for the Evoker slot. One of them. Fairly popular. And his fighting style would be such a banger here. Plus Tower would easily make a flashy entrance and work for an SBA.
            My guess is either Lobelia or Fraux if we're going two beyond Nier. The rest I think are just not very popular or stand out enough. Maybe Geisonborger, because that man would be very interesting to translate into Relink though we probably have enough male draphs for now.
                Maybe I just am an unapologetic Lobelia simp. And I'd like to see him featured for once. Since he'll never outshine Caim in the base game.
        i'm sorry if it's a dumb question, i'm new to the granblue universe, Jeanne is an original character or it is a collab with Fate ? She is very similiar to Jeanne D'arc from Fate series...
            Its a different version of Jeanne D'arc based on the actual person, there's even a J-Alter version here. They're kind of similar, but Granblue also literally has a Romeo and Juliet and they got guardian spirits because sure.
                Oooo thanks for that!!! I need to go search for the series Lore.
            She is originally from Rage of Bahamut and she can also be found in Shadowverse and Draglia Lost. She is one of their more iconic characters. In GBF she is a saint of Bahamut who is given the mission of combat Otherworlder intrusions. 

She is also a prominent character in the Rage of Bahamut: Genesis anime.
        Oh yes, Monika please!
    Honestly I'm good with just Zeta and Vaseraga for the Society. I like Eustace, Bea, and Ilsa more than the Dragon Knights but there's no reason to try and compete with them when the DKs are overrepresented enough as it is.

Move on and do the Zodiac Generals or the Horoscopes or something else that isn't already overrepresented in Versus.
        The game is ultimately a fanservice for fans who have been waiting for their favorite characters in this type of game. It's nice to have 'representation' or w/e but they still have shit to sell.
            Well my point is that there are other popular groups who have no playable characters and those should take priority over the popular groups who *do*.

They can absolutely sell Vikala, Fediel, or Sandalphon to more people than Beatrix or Ilsa.
            Yeah and they could sell units with Albert, Anne, Grea, Heles etc also since they are one of the more popular units they have. 

Hell Grea/Anne is prominent in *several* of their franchises and even got a stand alone anime about them.
        Yeah 2 is enough, I already think all 4 of the DKs was honestly a mistake, probably one of my biggest complaints since there is so many groups who don't even have one representative yet.

No Yuel/Socie/You/Kou, Heles/Naoise/Scathacha/Seruel, Albert/Minnah/Yurius, Lecia/Monika, Evoker, Vintage weapon user, Grea/Anne and probably some other group I am forgetting about.
As someone who doesn't playing fighting games, I just want the best characters in Relink. I don't care if they're in Versus or not.
    It doesn't have to be either/or.

Plenty of great characters who aren't in Versus and would be great in Relink.
A mage that works similar to Gran with resource spending/building could work but I don't know the gacha game to know if any exist.
    I just would like to see a male mage. We have two female already.
Give me Threo as a switch axe character. I wouldn't care who else gets included.
I wonder what are the odds of getting Nezha as a spear character
Seox would not be similar to either of them
He'd be a melee character, and we could get a dedicated parry button for his specialty like the one Zeta has
Looks like Sandalphon is literally killing every polling, just curious what makes him so popular? 

I’d love to see LIsa and Beatrix made into game so we can see more interactions between them. Like we got all four knights, then why not all society?
    Sandy is main chara in best event series in main game and Lucillius(next raid boss in relink) is his main enemy so it makes sense to add Sandalphon as playable chara for that imo
        Since Lucilliua is coming to the game as a hardcored boss as advertised, I don’t know if Sandy, this archangel with a equivalent power, will be on our ship…

Maybe he would be an assist like Rolan?
            Sandalphon is kinda equivalent to Lucilius, but even if he was added, he wouldn't be the strongest on our ship. That role will almost always go to the captain or Seofon, as those two are *absurdly* powerful.
        Hopefully, but come on, look at versus, 2 Belial, Beelze, Lucilius, but no Sandy xD
    Sandalphon is one of the small handful of GBF characters who has a very long arc and was an important part of the first major anniversary event series. Its pretty good, albeit a little standard anime stuff like most GBF characters. He's also pretty important in-lore, he's part of the whole Astral stuff that Relink's plot briefly talks about, and Narmaya's JP voice actress comically adores him.

Also Lucilius is coming to Relink and he is one of Sandalphon's major enemies alongside Belial.
        I am kinda worried about the power issue cuz since he’s so powerful, isn’t making him a playable character downplayed his strength a bit? Like get insta killed by two goblins lol
            Seofon (who's coming in April) if he "fully tries" and depending on the timeline (don't ask) is effectively a cosmic threat. In fact all the Eternals can be quite dangerous if fully left unchecked, but Seofon especially is dangerous.

Zeta and Vaseraga fought off a moon alien invasion full of giant robots.

>!Id!< is also quite powerful given their connection to >!Bahamut!<

Captain/Gran/Djeeta/Danchou with Lyria can summon Proto Bahamut who beyond Lyria's stamina issues can in-theory just kill any island with enough time, Bahamut is effectively the life and death cycle of the universe personified in a big kaiju dragon. Proto is a fraction of that power.

The power scaling in GBF goes from "Some old former master swordsman who fishes" to "I am a cosmic level threat to the world"

Don't over think it.
                Hah Yoda isn't even close to the floor for power scaling either thanks to all the SR and R characters you also have someone's grandma that makes crackers for everyone, a single mom looking for shopping bargains, various children pretending to be heroes or ninjas, and of course a child who isn't even dumb enough to be brave and just sits there terrified holding a knife but not attacking.
                    I just forget the SR/R characters exist because Cygames doesn't do anything with them until they get the SSR treatment like Juri. But I used Yoda simply because he's actually in this game so people here will know him and he's fairly low key compared to even many SSRs given we got "infused by (probably) draconic powers", or "super caster person", or "I'm the biggest giga chad of my kingdom" levels of clout being part of the many many SSR GBF characters without even factoring things like Primal Beasts and what not. I think the only characters I can think of who are notably lower would be like Tsubasa/Sho with their casual over the top motorcycles or magical musician characters like Selfira.
                        Hmm for SSR characters realistically at the bottom ranks I would also consider Herja, Jin, Volenna, and Juri as melee fighters who are probably better than anyone they know before they joined the crew, but don't offer any magical or other powers beyond that to compete with the real powerhouses. ...but the real hot take is that Vane belongs in that group too lol.
                            Yeah Vane is pretty much the worst Dragon Knight power scaling wise by design, its to obviously contrast him with Lancelot. I forgot Herja even existed as an SSR because she was so terrible lol.
                        Uh, anytime we see Yoda lately in the gacha he's seen butting heads with Aletheia or Yngwie for old times' sake and their fighting causes earthquakes across whatever poor island they're on.
            Seofon is being added and he is one of the most powerful characters in the lore. People won't mind so long as their favourite is in.
            Considering they are adding Seofon who is top tier in the verse, I don't think that would be an issue.
    To add onto what other people said Sandalphon is the ultimate "Writers bumble into a well written character" When Sandal was first introduced the writers intended for him to be a villain that was seen as too far gone and hatable despite his pitiable nature. The playerbase (particularly the female playerbase which really established itself with this event) immediately fell in love with him and talked about how they wish he could come back.

So writers at cygames decided they would make What Makes the Sky Blue Part 2. This time (and note they literally said this on stage) they set out to make a truly unredeemable monster that is just "the worst" and made Belial thinking that he would be so gross no one would love him. Instead the fanbase as a whole basically went "Spit in my face and call me slurs belial!" 

Cygames decided to just stick with the plan this time instead of doubling down. Though I like to think the experience gave them more handsome absolute monsters. Only one of them would truly ever be seen as such lol.
    He likes coffee
    He's a meme in the community. Narmaya's JP VA [fangirls](https://youtu.be/nA37oS2xXDs?si=oWBZF3S17GVc026c) over him every time he is mentioned in the convention news.

Though I agree with your opinions on adding Society members. Though I'd also want Zodiac or Evokers if they add more "faction" based characters.
        I didn’t know that XD MAO sang is truly a treasure.

Zodiac and Evokers are quite popular as I heard of, their weapons look interesting too. In fact I saw a Japanese site claiming that they would be likely be introduced to the game. 

今後のアップデートで追加が予想されるキャラ on games8 is where I found the info.
    I'm also new to Granblue, but from what I understand Sandalphon is an EXTREMELY powerful, archangel-like primal beast who inherited the will of Lucifer, one of the First primal beasts and more or less the God of the skies that Granblue takes place in.

Each of his wings represents a different element, and he has 6 of them. Fire, wind, earth, light, darkness, and water.

That's all I know about him so far, but he has very quickly become my most wanted character for both Versus rising and relink.
        He took the mantle of Supreme Primarch after Lucifer's death, and has been tried so far to redeem himself from his past sins by trying to look over the skies like Lucifer had done.
    He's popular due to his role in the What Makes the Sky Blue trilogy I think, which I only watched part 1, but will try to read part 2 and 3 when i have the chance.
    Great development (started out as a villain and got an amazing redemption arc), funny interactions with the crew and he is hot. Oh and he is basically the MC of the most popular arc in the gacha.
Does Randall have a master too?
That's Zooey, she's in Versus. Pretty popular character so she'll probably make it in.
    That’s good to know! I love Vane as my AI tank but Zooey here looks like one I would like to play myself.
        Zoi gameplay wise has never been really a tank in the way you'd expect. Her normal light version which is what is featured in the art there is actually a dodge tank with a heavy emphasis on dodging and getting a nuke as a result of dodging (remember gbf mobile is basically turn based final fantasy). 

Dark zoi is the breaker of balance and will likely never be acknowledged by cygames again. She has a skill that takes your teams hp to 1, gives them invincible for a turn and a very high healing cap drain. She single handedly broke the meta in such a ridiculous way the next two years of content were made in such a way to prevent her use.

I've been joking that if she comes to relink they'll give her the skill and it will break relink balance in the same way lol.
            > Dark zoi is the breaker of balance

Its funny because Dark Zooey is actually not even that good anymore which says many things about the state of the Dark Element, and it has little to do with the content denying her and more to do with how insane dark is as an element.

I don't think Conjunction if they translated into Relink would be that crazy in this game, it was broken in OG GBF because enmity was one of the easiest ways to hit damage cap thresholds and Garrison made dying difficult. But Relink's caps are easy to hit with any reasonable build and everything that can kill you does practically one shot damage so garrison synergy is irrelevant. It'd probably be like a marginally better Vane Rampart or Katalina Enhanced Invincible buff at best, which is very good but not that out of line.
                I don't think she would be good in any element regardless really. Conjunction bot is just not good enough any more since all elements got better healing, better defensive buttons and the enmity isn't really a thing any more, you simply don't need the raw attack power of being at 1hp.
            Ah, I see. Thanks for the breakdown.
            She was so broken that despite her being a summer unit they re-classified her as a grand unit.
    She would be more likely to make it in as a boss.
I don't think there is Paladin who uses a sword and shield. 

''Paladin'' as an archetype isn't seen in GBF really. Except Charlotta's knight order I guess.
    [Actually.....](https://gbf.wiki/Paladin)
        You miss baotorda
        I guess that is true.
Who cares about his Robot Fists? He's a Kamen Rider! I wanna kick the shit out of people!
Nicholas and Robomi too pls
>imo Nier or any of the Evokers aren't likely unless we get an adaptation of The World raid, since their existence is heavily tied into the existence of the Arcarum, which The World created.

They already stated that Lucilius raid is coming without story, so they can also add Nier without Arcarum storyline.
    I was thinking of Raids being additions to the story, while characters added should be related to content in game. Like since Lucilius is added that means they could adapt the Belial and Beelzebub raids or add Sandalphon or the Primarchs as playable characters. I'd love to see Evokers added, but I'd want content related to their story added first or alongside them like The World or an Arcarum/Replicard Sandbox style gamemode, that way newer players can have a sort of stepping stone to exploring more of the lore behind them. Like how Zeta and Vaseraga are good additions, but if the Pyet-A boss didn't exist I'd find it hard to justify them being in game when they're already in Versus.
Yeah no story doesn't matter, half the cast is literally just there with only fate episodes barely scratching the surface of their story, they dont need to add anything for evokers just like they aren't adding anything for eternals.
Both this game and Rising suffer from the problem that they've been in development for a while so all of the characters are from the first two years of GBF's life so the options are limited to the same small pool.

Rising was doing better with Nier and Grimnir but then went right back into it with fucking Vane and Beatrix (I love them, don't get me wrong but they're pretty basic choices)

Like where's Meg? Where's Vikala? Where are the Six Dragons?
    Personally I'm sick of bow much they already push vikala, I'd rather a different zodiac character got in like Vajra or Makura. The six dragons would unpack a whole chunk of lore that I don't think relink really wants to get in too.
        Oh agreed, Kumbhira is my preferred choice of the Zodiacs. I only said Vikala because she's the most popular.

And I think you can probably swing one of the Six Dragons if you focus on their individual aspects over their overarching lore.
            I suppose when thinking about their lore, since this is a different timeline to the gacha game. Are the 6 dragons the same since their event showed they would be different in other universes even if all the other characters looked the same.
                As far as we know, that rule only applied to Orologia's simulations.

Alternate universe versions of the Six Dragons have already shown up in other events.
    >Where's Vikala?

In Princess Connect.
Yup, that’s the benefit of having a great story as backing. However, far as I know the game is set at relatively earlier stage of the main GBF story so probably not 400 but like 100 to choose from. Still huge possibility lies ahead. 

Besides, comparing to risings you are also have a benefit of playing pretty much like a gacha game but the waifus and husbandos no needed to be gachaed. 

Rising is also a great game but I just enjoyed RELINK a little bit more: more anime graphics, easier boss fights (rising sometime is just too hard for me) with better visuals: dude the proto Bahamut fight is pleasing to watch and be part of it.
    Don't think continuity really matters for these side stories.
Plus Kat has Ares in Relink, which she only acquired quite late in the main story.
        Oh really? That opens up quite a lot possibilities
            Ya the Ares thing is funny because it happens like 100ish chapters after when this story is supposed to happen.
Joker character + mechanic involving tag team.

EZ pick.
Yup, it is plausible that they have Aya Hirano voice Beatrix in two games at the same time cuz she’s probably busy with her work…
We’ll see in March what would they bring
To be honest if they add Beatrix they'd probably add Eustace  as well. Which I'd be in favour of as it is weird we have no male erune.
We do have Ghanda, but we also have Eugen and there's probably some long time GBF fans who wants at least a Soiya duo of Soriz and Eugen. You can make Soriz pretty different from Ghanda if you try, he's got a fairly distinct skill set from him.
    In that case I'd prefer getting Jin
        I probably would too, but Cygames needs to remember Jin exists ~~and give him an SSR that isn't terrible~~.
I genuinely hope Beatrix will come to RELINK well because she’s coming to RELINK with Vane
Baal, and any harp characters really, would be funny to see gameplay wise. I imagine in a coop fight everyone would be fighting all serious and then this one weirdo is just rocking the guitar in the middle of the arena
>Rein is a Rising exclusive character.

And Bubs was planned as Versus OC character, but he got into main gacha game. So I don't think it matters that much.
    Source.
You say that but wind is literally going to be only 3 male swordsman with Seofon's release.
    Seofon isn't a swordsman tho
        Yes he is. He's just more of a magic swordsman instead of a traditional one.
1 up for monika and Lecia, they deserve more love
It is possible that Rolan will become a playable character since he’s got the model and everything ready. 

Tho I doubt he’ll be a mage focus guy…maybe like a magus from pathfinder? You use magic and sword at the same time? 

There’re a lot more mages looking dude, including a Gandalf looking one and a lot more.
There are some male mages in GBF that are popular enough to become playable, such as: Drang (magic balls as weapon,>!the great grandchild of Ferry's little sister!<), water) Elmott (fire magic user, staff), Sarunan (light/dark, staff), Noa (light primal, a paddle as weapon, but I doubt if they'll add Primal to the game). 

Alanaan and Estarriola are also fairly famous but I don't think any Evokers will be added soon, lore-wise...
I’d love to see Vira coming and express her overwhelming “love” toward Kata XD
Yet Beatrix were so much forgotten by Cygames that the other half (Zeta) got alot of alts and shilled by them. I waited so long for Grand Bea but it seems like Bea popularity have fallen off the charts nowadays. Even it took them so long to tease her in GBVSR.

Would love to see her pre rework clock mechanic in Relink thou.
Same, I don’t mind paying more for dlc characters! At least better than spending on gacha haha
Aliza should have got Ghanda's spot as a brawler/martial artist T_T
    Dude absolutely, I could see her having a super fast paced playstyle.
> For one, I don't necessarily like characters being able to hit damage caps without outside assistance

OG GBF already solved this with variable defense stats in harder content, there's pretty much 4-5 (iirc) different relevant defense values in GBF's endgame content and that always dramatically changed how you made your build/team because you need more modifiers and buffs and less cap break based on how high the defense stat was unless your equipment was crazy high.
    And that's the kind of design we need pushing forward. I really do appreciate the people who choose to play support (Looking at you Hunting Horn mains) in these types of games because even though they COULD just unga bunga DPS like every other character, they understand that making other people hit more and get hit less is just as respectable as the guy whos goal is to make sure every breakable part of this boss breaks.
        I think supportive set ups are valuable enough in Relink, Danchou Substitute + Katalina/Vane invincibility is super funny. It just isn't the pure buffer kind. Plus imo being someone like Ferry who generate SBA super fast is a pretty supportive role because you effectively stun lock the boss if you time your stuff right. Like Ferry might as well be an enabling support in practice with how Proto Baha work because she makes sure Baha doesn't fly off so your party can just stomp his face into the floor. That's probably far more important then anything the DPS are actually doing in terms of ensuring the fight goes as smooth as it does.

But I think damage cap is a more interesting system when caps are actually hard to hit, as shown in actual GBF.
            Ask us poor Rosetta players how valid being a support feels...
                As I said:

> It [support that's valuable] just isn't the pure buffer kind

I know that, but there's still supportive enablers in this game just Rosetta isn't one of them unfortunately.
                    Fair. 'Buffers' have a shitty life. Offensive supports are eating fairly good.
Yea, the existence of dmg cup making dmg buffs kinda falling hard I do feel that yet that means they have to change the dmg calculation algorithm…
Does everyone here play fighting games or something? I didn't think there was a lot of overlap between them and the RPG genre. Personally I have zero interest in fighting games and will never play one, so I'd rather see the best characters in Relink independent of games of other genres.
    Yeah I don't get the constant call back to versus. This game is evidently way more popular than Versus ever did, it's clear there's a lot of people who don't care about overlapping as long as it's good characters being put in the game.
    There's a good amount of cross over, but many people just want to see characters that haven't been given the chance to be in anything outside of the mobile game. This series has a lot of fan favorites that haven't gotten that chance yet.
You say that we should get more characters that aren't in Versus, and then half the characters you want are ones that are (going to be) in Versus...

Edit: And he blocked me lmao
    Figures LMAO
    I didn't say all. I'm just saying we don't need Zoey, Nier, who is only known by the yandere trope, nor do we need another melee. 

I said Eustace and Beatrix because they get very little attention. Seox because he's one of the most popular Eternals with Siete. 

Ilsa has no attention, and yet there's a whole group of knights, don't make me repeat myself. I simply said Eustace and Beatrix to fill Society roster, and as well as did I say every character from VS? No. Good to remind you.

Amazing I'm getting downvoted even though he put words in my mouth. I blocked because of such.
        Yup, I am down with completing the whole society team, besides LIsa is a range character too right? We do need more range characters.

I am also very interesting in what would they say when chain burst ultimate, the four knights got one so why not give the same love to the society?
Indeed, real gamers want Mukku and Gachapin.
Eustance and Bea are already in Versus, why would you do the same thing as with the Knights and put them into Relink as well? Same thing as with Six. You're contradicting yourself with your first sentence and your second. It doesn't sound like your issue with it is "underrepresented" characters and rather "characters who got into VS that I don't like as much as other characters who got into VS".

Ilsa getting in would be great since she's not in VS. We do not need the whole group of Society members *again*, and I like the Society members way more than I like the Knights.
Yea indeed, but I am just wondering how likely they will be in the game because there are a lot of overlap between these two games character wise. I think VS got all the characters we have but more right?

Edits: ah never-mind I checked it out and it looks like we do have four characters that do not show up in VS
I need my dual pistol twin tien in the game
Bold of you to assume they'd let Lecia back in.

Don't get me wrong I love the idea of Lecia joining too but considering how hard they are avoiding that in the main game I got doubts.

Also the Lyria simps might riot again (as far as I'm aware that's what got her exiled from the main story begin with)
Emmm tbh with you I actually had enough of seeing 2B all the way around. Like literally every gacha game has her if they do collab…

Plus she’s already there in Rising XD

Which one? From left to right it goes Beatrix, Nier, Rein, Zooey, Vira.
    Beatrix is pretty
Granblue has a lot of weird ass characters a [literal cat](https://gbf.wiki/images/a/a4/Npc_zoom_3040452000_01.png) can be playable if we count for everything that's possible.

That aside, we got characters with [pure draconic power](https://gbf.wiki/images/9/95/Npc_zoom_3040122000_03.png), we got who are far more "traditional" type of polearm users then say Zeta due to being more grounded and [possibly having a shield](https://gbf.wiki/images/5/5b/Npc_zoom_3030096000_01.png), we got a more traditional [big gun sniper character](https://gbf.wiki/images/c/c2/Npc_zoom_3040049000_03.png) then Eugen, we got many [types](https://gbf.wiki/images/e/ec/Npc_zoom_3040119000_02.png) of [casters](https://gbf.wiki/images/d/d4/Npc_zoom_3040011000_03.png) that can [exist](https://gbf.wiki/images/c/cc/Npc_zoom_3040215000_02.png) in the roster, we got a [robo suit man](https://gbf.wiki/images/d/d5/Npc_zoom_3040088000_01.png), we got [girl with a paint gun because sure](https://gbf.wiki/images/4/43/Npc_zoom_3040277000_02.png), and we got a very [literal puppet girl](https://gbf.wiki/images/c/cb/Npc_zoom_3040111000_01.png)

Granblue is fully of whacky characters and skill sets that can have some interesting translations. Because I can pretty firmly tell you most the characters here are actually fairly faithful to some iteration of them in the gacha, almost every skill is some kind of reference somewhere which is why Vane has 3 seemingly redundant buffs because his buffs got progressively different as he got newer versions of himself over the years.
    > and we got a very literal puppet girl

Two actually, Cendrillion is also one.
It’s an unfortunate thing because how hard the development went and as no commercial expert I do not know if the current sales success recovers the cost and how much will player staying in the game. Yet I do want to keep optimistic: given how much the game is succeed in just twenty days I believe there would be far more contents coming to it than original plan. 

But there is one thing I do know that is I am more than happy to welcome paid character dlcs and more quality contents to be added.

Furthermore, think about it the original GBF today is an ancient game already and still gets quality content and consistent players so there will be more characters coming consistently which doesn’t sound that bad after all.
Right the elements, because I used war elemental all the time almost forgot its existence lol. But yes the game current have uneven number of characters in each element so it is plausible they’ll release more characters to fill the blank: dark have four while others only have like three.
    wind is lacking the most with only the captain and yodarha😭
        Yea, I wish they could release Lecia, but unlikely. What we do know is that one of the new coming ups that swordsman is wind element, the other archer is light.
            oh i definitely would've thought seofen the swordsman to be light and tweyen wind
            We'll probably get Monika before we get Lecia, which is probably fine anyway as Monika has probably better gameplay potential.
                Ohhh but only if that is going to happen :( I don’t think both of them on any priority.
        Siete is coming for wind at least.
I miss Soriz :( although I don’t know him much but that song really made me laugh hard
    It is worth noting, as I assume most people don't know this in this subreddit, but Granblue has character songs (even with music videos) sung by their JP vas. Soriz's versus theme is based on [his character theme](https://youtu.be/kGs9_LyTJt8) with Eugen and Jin (who isn't in this game and Cygames forgot about probably)
Maybe not too similar? She’s got that giant sniper rifle so maybe she can attack very far range in a safe spot?
    ... So just like Eugen?
        She’s got a huge rifle, like almost taller than herself. Her skill in the original GBF tho is the same as Rackam. You can check her wiki page. https://gbf.wiki/Silva

Tbh she’s probably more like huge dmg one shot type? Maybe charge shooting?
            Eugen has charged shooting and he has a mode called SNIPER VISION with tremendous range. Action game wise they'd be extremely similar.

Not impossible for her to come, but extremely similar base mechanics. I think what makes her not come into relink by a long-shot is the fact they wanna make the face of the franchise, so using chars other people know more (like the GBF Versus ones) is prefferable.

And even if they'd use unknown chars, it would be from factions already on both games (DK, society and etc).
There's plenty of males. The reason why most people keep spamming girls is 100% waifuism, regardless of what they claim
    This is what I was assuming
I do not have the precise number top of my head, but theoretically should be more female characters given its a gacha game. This does not mean they are far more, the reason why there are more female characters mentioned here is because 

1 I like their seiyuu or character designs (not lore because I don’t know much)
2 I just picked some memorable face randomly
3 our game already have some of the most popular males but not most popular females: according to a 2022 polling it looks like we got none of the top popular female characters but some of the male. So I would speculate more on females that are popular but not yet in game. Notes this polling is outdated but still many on the list aren’t showed up in game.

If you are interested you can google GBF 2022 polling.
Nope they did not say this game will only get three updates, the information I have is that we have a roadmap with unclear paid dlc contents and clear free content updates until April. 

This game would be likely going under continue slow updates unless they announce something big in the coming month March 10th GBF anniversary.
I don’t know but did the Evokers debut early in the story or are they added lately? This game seem to have set on earlier journey of the main GBF story line (thou might not)
    > I don’t know but did the Evokers debut early in the story or are they added lately? This game seem to have set on earlier journey of the main GBF story line (thou might not)

Evokers are a few years old, but this stuff is for sure not all recent canon.

For example:

Katalina has Ares

Zeta has various parts of her later plot advancement for her crew's particular arc. Namely anything to do with blasting beams from her spear and flurry raining spears from nowhere using magic. Which that advancement is from 2020.

Vaseraga I'm pretty sure has his own advancements to match Zeta's given we're in post that arc of The Society stuff.

Danchou/Captain/Gran/Djeeta are the Singularity which is something that gets brought up pretty late into the story.

The real catch is that The Evokers, like the Eternals and frankly almost every single character in Granblue Fantasy, are optional things that can happen at any point in the story. Granblue's timeline is literally just spaghetti where everything is canon regardless of what you the player do within it. Which justifies the game having this many characters and about 5-6 different potential cataclysmic disasters all exist in the same space without bumping into each other.
        This is what I was looking for! Thx
Yea ghanda is suppose to be some badass but he's kinda lame.
> Wait isn't relink after the gbf story? Hence the astras and other terms being present

Depends on where you define "after", because Granblue's timeline is ultra mega fucky wucky and by design pretty much doesn't make any sense time wise beyond its specific bubbles that define entire arcs. Its multi-timeline fuckery where everything that has ever happened is canon at once no matter if it makes sense or not as long as it exists in the setting.

Astrals as a concept have been a thing for a very long time, since 2014 even and What Makes The Sky Blue 1 was when we started getting that more high concept stuff show up more often and that is from 2017 I believe.
I mean another mage character would be nice
    I would pay incredible money to get a Notte skin for Vyrn.
>!She's the Captain's mother.!<
    Damn that's interesting.
Frankly I'd rather we add other characters who have modest to high popularity then trying to complete sets of characters.

I imagine we'll see Sandalphon eventually, probably 1-2 Evokers to match our Eternal reps (who, is anyone's guess though Nier is probably going to exist due to popularity), some zodiac general, probably see Yuel for a tailed Erune rep if only because of Versus, Zooey will probably also make it in because she's popular and fairly different from most reps due to being a primal.

As far as slightly more out there picks.

Sturm, Drang, Monika (because Lecia is not allowed to exist even if she makes more sense here), Jeanne, maybe Albert, and I'd also like to see Naoise personally but I'm not sure how many characters they want to add and Naoise isn't that super popular even if he is part of a fairly large event sub arc.
    If we do get a Evoker rep I hope it's Fraux honestly, just for the lack of Erune and Fist characters.
        Fraux has probably one of the better chances for sure. I can see her or Lobelia very equally possible unless Cygames wants to put a Harvin in like they did when they picked Uno/Anre in Versus.
    I must admit I have some personal favor toward the rest of society members not only they’re waifuable but there could be more interesting interactions. 

I was shocked the other day finding how much unique dialogues this game have among characters, like literally the knights each have four to five unique interactions between them, the “Wang Chan” really chocked me hard. So that’s why I kinda want to see they complete the society.
        I mean Sturm and Drang are a duo and have plenty of banter (Drang also has ties to Ferry), there's plenty of other duos you can have too like Albert/Yurius, Naoise/Scathacha/Seruel/Heles in some combination, Monika/Lecia if Cygames feels like being especially daring.

There's plenty of fun interactions to be had, especially given that Cygames might just always release in duos which makes combinations like this easier to release.
            Grea / Anne

Yuel / Socie

Mari / Meg
            Well it could be possible that we get the likes of Strum and Drang in a future update perhaps since the two of them are seen in the backround of Ferry's second Fate episode in Relink.
                Do they have in game model or was just mentioned?
                    Sturm was mentioned as "that man who gave her a familiar sounding name" and that's all. No models for either and no actual mention of Sturm.
                        Check the reddit topic in this sub titled 2 guests in Ferry fate episode, we see the two characters in the backround, although it's unclear if they are in 2D or 3D.
            True, as a Seiyuu fan I am incredibly satisfied with how many interactions there are, like every characters all have special lines with everyone…if this is the case only for Gran I mean it’s normal but Cy did it for everyone, EVERYONE. 

I do love to see more DUOs coming, it’s just part of my personal taste to have a full four society team 
, so there might be an interesting chain burst line, like you know the four knights have one.  

The only problem I have with this game is I can’t pay more XD don’t wanna buy the color pack
    I'm praying for Lobelia for the Evoker slot. One of them. Fairly popular. And his fighting style would be such a banger here. Plus Tower would easily make a flashy entrance and work for an SBA.
        My guess is either Lobelia or Fraux if we're going two beyond Nier. The rest I think are just not very popular or stand out enough. Maybe Geisonborger, because that man would be very interesting to translate into Relink though we probably have enough male draphs for now.
            Maybe I just am an unapologetic Lobelia simp. And I'd like to see him featured for once. Since he'll never outshine Caim in the base game.
    i'm sorry if it's a dumb question, i'm new to the granblue universe, Jeanne is an original character or it is a collab with Fate ? She is very similiar to Jeanne D'arc from Fate series...
        Its a different version of Jeanne D'arc based on the actual person, there's even a J-Alter version here. They're kind of similar, but Granblue also literally has a Romeo and Juliet and they got guardian spirits because sure.
            Oooo thanks for that!!! I need to go search for the series Lore.
        She is originally from Rage of Bahamut and she can also be found in Shadowverse and Draglia Lost. She is one of their more iconic characters. In GBF she is a saint of Bahamut who is given the mission of combat Otherworlder intrusions. 

She is also a prominent character in the Rage of Bahamut: Genesis anime.
    Oh yes, Monika please!
Honestly I'm good with just Zeta and Vaseraga for the Society. I like Eustace, Bea, and Ilsa more than the Dragon Knights but there's no reason to try and compete with them when the DKs are overrepresented enough as it is.

Move on and do the Zodiac Generals or the Horoscopes or something else that isn't already overrepresented in Versus.
    The game is ultimately a fanservice for fans who have been waiting for their favorite characters in this type of game. It's nice to have 'representation' or w/e but they still have shit to sell.
        Well my point is that there are other popular groups who have no playable characters and those should take priority over the popular groups who *do*.

They can absolutely sell Vikala, Fediel, or Sandalphon to more people than Beatrix or Ilsa.
        Yeah and they could sell units with Albert, Anne, Grea, Heles etc also since they are one of the more popular units they have. 

Hell Grea/Anne is prominent in *several* of their franchises and even got a stand alone anime about them.
    Yeah 2 is enough, I already think all 4 of the DKs was honestly a mistake, probably one of my biggest complaints since there is so many groups who don't even have one representative yet.

No Yuel/Socie/You/Kou, Heles/Naoise/Scathacha/Seruel, Albert/Minnah/Yurius, Lecia/Monika, Evoker, Vintage weapon user, Grea/Anne and probably some other group I am forgetting about.
It doesn't have to be either/or.

Plenty of great characters who aren't in Versus and would be great in Relink.
I just would like to see a male mage. We have two female already.
Sandy is main chara in best event series in main game and Lucillius(next raid boss in relink) is his main enemy so it makes sense to add Sandalphon as playable chara for that imo
    Since Lucilliua is coming to the game as a hardcored boss as advertised, I don’t know if Sandy, this archangel with a equivalent power, will be on our ship…

Maybe he would be an assist like Rolan?
        Sandalphon is kinda equivalent to Lucilius, but even if he was added, he wouldn't be the strongest on our ship. That role will almost always go to the captain or Seofon, as those two are *absurdly* powerful.
    Hopefully, but come on, look at versus, 2 Belial, Beelze, Lucilius, but no Sandy xD
Sandalphon is one of the small handful of GBF characters who has a very long arc and was an important part of the first major anniversary event series. Its pretty good, albeit a little standard anime stuff like most GBF characters. He's also pretty important in-lore, he's part of the whole Astral stuff that Relink's plot briefly talks about, and Narmaya's JP voice actress comically adores him.

Also Lucilius is coming to Relink and he is one of Sandalphon's major enemies alongside Belial.
    I am kinda worried about the power issue cuz since he’s so powerful, isn’t making him a playable character downplayed his strength a bit? Like get insta killed by two goblins lol
        Seofon (who's coming in April) if he "fully tries" and depending on the timeline (don't ask) is effectively a cosmic threat. In fact all the Eternals can be quite dangerous if fully left unchecked, but Seofon especially is dangerous.

Zeta and Vaseraga fought off a moon alien invasion full of giant robots.

>!Id!< is also quite powerful given their connection to >!Bahamut!<

Captain/Gran/Djeeta/Danchou with Lyria can summon Proto Bahamut who beyond Lyria's stamina issues can in-theory just kill any island with enough time, Bahamut is effectively the life and death cycle of the universe personified in a big kaiju dragon. Proto is a fraction of that power.

The power scaling in GBF goes from "Some old former master swordsman who fishes" to "I am a cosmic level threat to the world"

Don't over think it.
            Hah Yoda isn't even close to the floor for power scaling either thanks to all the SR and R characters you also have someone's grandma that makes crackers for everyone, a single mom looking for shopping bargains, various children pretending to be heroes or ninjas, and of course a child who isn't even dumb enough to be brave and just sits there terrified holding a knife but not attacking.
                I just forget the SR/R characters exist because Cygames doesn't do anything with them until they get the SSR treatment like Juri. But I used Yoda simply because he's actually in this game so people here will know him and he's fairly low key compared to even many SSRs given we got "infused by (probably) draconic powers", or "super caster person", or "I'm the biggest giga chad of my kingdom" levels of clout being part of the many many SSR GBF characters without even factoring things like Primal Beasts and what not. I think the only characters I can think of who are notably lower would be like Tsubasa/Sho with their casual over the top motorcycles or magical musician characters like Selfira.
                    Hmm for SSR characters realistically at the bottom ranks I would also consider Herja, Jin, Volenna, and Juri as melee fighters who are probably better than anyone they know before they joined the crew, but don't offer any magical or other powers beyond that to compete with the real powerhouses. ...but the real hot take is that Vane belongs in that group too lol.
                        Yeah Vane is pretty much the worst Dragon Knight power scaling wise by design, its to obviously contrast him with Lancelot. I forgot Herja even existed as an SSR because she was so terrible lol.
                    Uh, anytime we see Yoda lately in the gacha he's seen butting heads with Aletheia or Yngwie for old times' sake and their fighting causes earthquakes across whatever poor island they're on.
        Seofon is being added and he is one of the most powerful characters in the lore. People won't mind so long as their favourite is in.
        Considering they are adding Seofon who is top tier in the verse, I don't think that would be an issue.
To add onto what other people said Sandalphon is the ultimate "Writers bumble into a well written character" When Sandal was first introduced the writers intended for him to be a villain that was seen as too far gone and hatable despite his pitiable nature. The playerbase (particularly the female playerbase which really established itself with this event) immediately fell in love with him and talked about how they wish he could come back.

So writers at cygames decided they would make What Makes the Sky Blue Part 2. This time (and note they literally said this on stage) they set out to make a truly unredeemable monster that is just "the worst" and made Belial thinking that he would be so gross no one would love him. Instead the fanbase as a whole basically went "Spit in my face and call me slurs belial!" 

Cygames decided to just stick with the plan this time instead of doubling down. Though I like to think the experience gave them more handsome absolute monsters. Only one of them would truly ever be seen as such lol.
He likes coffee
He's a meme in the community. Narmaya's JP VA [fangirls](https://youtu.be/nA37oS2xXDs?si=oWBZF3S17GVc026c) over him every time he is mentioned in the convention news.

Though I agree with your opinions on adding Society members. Though I'd also want Zodiac or Evokers if they add more "faction" based characters.
    I didn’t know that XD MAO sang is truly a treasure.

Zodiac and Evokers are quite popular as I heard of, their weapons look interesting too. In fact I saw a Japanese site claiming that they would be likely be introduced to the game. 

今後のアップデートで追加が予想されるキャラ on games8 is where I found the info.
I'm also new to Granblue, but from what I understand Sandalphon is an EXTREMELY powerful, archangel-like primal beast who inherited the will of Lucifer, one of the First primal beasts and more or less the God of the skies that Granblue takes place in.

Each of his wings represents a different element, and he has 6 of them. Fire, wind, earth, light, darkness, and water.

That's all I know about him so far, but he has very quickly become my most wanted character for both Versus rising and relink.
    He took the mantle of Supreme Primarch after Lucifer's death, and has been tried so far to redeem himself from his past sins by trying to look over the skies like Lucifer had done.
He's popular due to his role in the What Makes the Sky Blue trilogy I think, which I only watched part 1, but will try to read part 2 and 3 when i have the chance.
Great development (started out as a villain and got an amazing redemption arc), funny interactions with the crew and he is hot. Oh and he is basically the MC of the most popular arc in the gacha.
That’s good to know! I love Vane as my AI tank but Zooey here looks like one I would like to play myself.
    Zoi gameplay wise has never been really a tank in the way you'd expect. Her normal light version which is what is featured in the art there is actually a dodge tank with a heavy emphasis on dodging and getting a nuke as a result of dodging (remember gbf mobile is basically turn based final fantasy). 

Dark zoi is the breaker of balance and will likely never be acknowledged by cygames again. She has a skill that takes your teams hp to 1, gives them invincible for a turn and a very high healing cap drain. She single handedly broke the meta in such a ridiculous way the next two years of content were made in such a way to prevent her use.

I've been joking that if she comes to relink they'll give her the skill and it will break relink balance in the same way lol.
        > Dark zoi is the breaker of balance

Its funny because Dark Zooey is actually not even that good anymore which says many things about the state of the Dark Element, and it has little to do with the content denying her and more to do with how insane dark is as an element.

I don't think Conjunction if they translated into Relink would be that crazy in this game, it was broken in OG GBF because enmity was one of the easiest ways to hit damage cap thresholds and Garrison made dying difficult. But Relink's caps are easy to hit with any reasonable build and everything that can kill you does practically one shot damage so garrison synergy is irrelevant. It'd probably be like a marginally better Vane Rampart or Katalina Enhanced Invincible buff at best, which is very good but not that out of line.
            I don't think she would be good in any element regardless really. Conjunction bot is just not good enough any more since all elements got better healing, better defensive buttons and the enmity isn't really a thing any more, you simply don't need the raw attack power of being at 1hp.
        Ah, I see. Thanks for the breakdown.
        She was so broken that despite her being a summer unit they re-classified her as a grand unit.
She would be more likely to make it in as a boss.
[Actually.....](https://gbf.wiki/Paladin)
    You miss baotorda
    I guess that is true.
I was thinking of Raids being additions to the story, while characters added should be related to content in game. Like since Lucilius is added that means they could adapt the Belial and Beelzebub raids or add Sandalphon or the Primarchs as playable characters. I'd love to see Evokers added, but I'd want content related to their story added first or alongside them like The World or an Arcarum/Replicard Sandbox style gamemode, that way newer players can have a sort of stepping stone to exploring more of the lore behind them. Like how Zeta and Vaseraga are good additions, but if the Pyet-A boss didn't exist I'd find it hard to justify them being in game when they're already in Versus.
Personally I'm sick of bow much they already push vikala, I'd rather a different zodiac character got in like Vajra or Makura. The six dragons would unpack a whole chunk of lore that I don't think relink really wants to get in too.
    Oh agreed, Kumbhira is my preferred choice of the Zodiacs. I only said Vikala because she's the most popular.

And I think you can probably swing one of the Six Dragons if you focus on their individual aspects over their overarching lore.
        I suppose when thinking about their lore, since this is a different timeline to the gacha game. Are the 6 dragons the same since their event showed they would be different in other universes even if all the other characters looked the same.
            As far as we know, that rule only applied to Orologia's simulations.

Alternate universe versions of the Six Dragons have already shown up in other events.
>Where's Vikala?

In Princess Connect.
Don't think continuity really matters for these side stories.
Plus Kat has Ares in Relink, which she only acquired quite late in the main story.
    Oh really? That opens up quite a lot possibilities
        Ya the Ares thing is funny because it happens like 100ish chapters after when this story is supposed to happen.
In that case I'd prefer getting Jin
    I probably would too, but Cygames needs to remember Jin exists ~~and give him an SSR that isn't terrible~~.
Source.
Seofon isn't a swordsman tho
    Yes he is. He's just more of a magic swordsman instead of a traditional one.
Dude absolutely, I could see her having a super fast paced playstyle.
And that's the kind of design we need pushing forward. I really do appreciate the people who choose to play support (Looking at you Hunting Horn mains) in these types of games because even though they COULD just unga bunga DPS like every other character, they understand that making other people hit more and get hit less is just as respectable as the guy whos goal is to make sure every breakable part of this boss breaks.
    I think supportive set ups are valuable enough in Relink, Danchou Substitute + Katalina/Vane invincibility is super funny. It just isn't the pure buffer kind. Plus imo being someone like Ferry who generate SBA super fast is a pretty supportive role because you effectively stun lock the boss if you time your stuff right. Like Ferry might as well be an enabling support in practice with how Proto Baha work because she makes sure Baha doesn't fly off so your party can just stomp his face into the floor. That's probably far more important then anything the DPS are actually doing in terms of ensuring the fight goes as smooth as it does.

But I think damage cap is a more interesting system when caps are actually hard to hit, as shown in actual GBF.
        Ask us poor Rosetta players how valid being a support feels...
            As I said:

> It [support that's valuable] just isn't the pure buffer kind

I know that, but there's still supportive enablers in this game just Rosetta isn't one of them unfortunately.
                Fair. 'Buffers' have a shitty life. Offensive supports are eating fairly good.
Yeah I don't get the constant call back to versus. This game is evidently way more popular than Versus ever did, it's clear there's a lot of people who don't care about overlapping as long as it's good characters being put in the game.
There's a good amount of cross over, but many people just want to see characters that haven't been given the chance to be in anything outside of the mobile game. This series has a lot of fan favorites that haven't gotten that chance yet.
Figures LMAO
I didn't say all. I'm just saying we don't need Zoey, Nier, who is only known by the yandere trope, nor do we need another melee. 

I said Eustace and Beatrix because they get very little attention. Seox because he's one of the most popular Eternals with Siete. 

Ilsa has no attention, and yet there's a whole group of knights, don't make me repeat myself. I simply said Eustace and Beatrix to fill Society roster, and as well as did I say every character from VS? No. Good to remind you.

Amazing I'm getting downvoted even though he put words in my mouth. I blocked because of such.
    Yup, I am down with completing the whole society team, besides LIsa is a range character too right? We do need more range characters.

I am also very interesting in what would they say when chain burst ultimate, the four knights got one so why not give the same love to the society?
Beatrix is pretty
> and we got a very literal puppet girl

Two actually, Cendrillion is also one.
wind is lacking the most with only the captain and yodarha😭
    Yea, I wish they could release Lecia, but unlikely. What we do know is that one of the new coming ups that swordsman is wind element, the other archer is light.
        oh i definitely would've thought seofen the swordsman to be light and tweyen wind
        We'll probably get Monika before we get Lecia, which is probably fine anyway as Monika has probably better gameplay potential.
            Ohhh but only if that is going to happen :( I don’t think both of them on any priority.
    Siete is coming for wind at least.
It is worth noting, as I assume most people don't know this in this subreddit, but Granblue has character songs (even with music videos) sung by their JP vas. Soriz's versus theme is based on [his character theme](https://youtu.be/kGs9_LyTJt8) with Eugen and Jin (who isn't in this game and Cygames forgot about probably)
... So just like Eugen?
    She’s got a huge rifle, like almost taller than herself. Her skill in the original GBF tho is the same as Rackam. You can check her wiki page. https://gbf.wiki/Silva

Tbh she’s probably more like huge dmg one shot type? Maybe charge shooting?
        Eugen has charged shooting and he has a mode called SNIPER VISION with tremendous range. Action game wise they'd be extremely similar.

Not impossible for her to come, but extremely similar base mechanics. I think what makes her not come into relink by a long-shot is the fact they wanna make the face of the franchise, so using chars other people know more (like the GBF Versus ones) is prefferable.

And even if they'd use unknown chars, it would be from factions already on both games (DK, society and etc).
This is what I was assuming
> I don’t know but did the Evokers debut early in the story or are they added lately? This game seem to have set on earlier journey of the main GBF story line (thou might not)

Evokers are a few years old, but this stuff is for sure not all recent canon.

For example:

Katalina has Ares

Zeta has various parts of her later plot advancement for her crew's particular arc. Namely anything to do with blasting beams from her spear and flurry raining spears from nowhere using magic. Which that advancement is from 2020.

Vaseraga I'm pretty sure has his own advancements to match Zeta's given we're in post that arc of The Society stuff.

Danchou/Captain/Gran/Djeeta are the Singularity which is something that gets brought up pretty late into the story.

The real catch is that The Evokers, like the Eternals and frankly almost every single character in Granblue Fantasy, are optional things that can happen at any point in the story. Granblue's timeline is literally just spaghetti where everything is canon regardless of what you the player do within it. Which justifies the game having this many characters and about 5-6 different potential cataclysmic disasters all exist in the same space without bumping into each other.
    This is what I was looking for! Thx
I would pay incredible money to get a Notte skin for Vyrn.
Damn that's interesting.
If we do get a Evoker rep I hope it's Fraux honestly, just for the lack of Erune and Fist characters.
    Fraux has probably one of the better chances for sure. I can see her or Lobelia very equally possible unless Cygames wants to put a Harvin in like they did when they picked Uno/Anre in Versus.
I must admit I have some personal favor toward the rest of society members not only they’re waifuable but there could be more interesting interactions. 

I was shocked the other day finding how much unique dialogues this game have among characters, like literally the knights each have four to five unique interactions between them, the “Wang Chan” really chocked me hard. So that’s why I kinda want to see they complete the society.
    I mean Sturm and Drang are a duo and have plenty of banter (Drang also has ties to Ferry), there's plenty of other duos you can have too like Albert/Yurius, Naoise/Scathacha/Seruel/Heles in some combination, Monika/Lecia if Cygames feels like being especially daring.

There's plenty of fun interactions to be had, especially given that Cygames might just always release in duos which makes combinations like this easier to release.
        Grea / Anne

Yuel / Socie

Mari / Meg
        Well it could be possible that we get the likes of Strum and Drang in a future update perhaps since the two of them are seen in the backround of Ferry's second Fate episode in Relink.
            Do they have in game model or was just mentioned?
                Sturm was mentioned as "that man who gave her a familiar sounding name" and that's all. No models for either and no actual mention of Sturm.
                    Check the reddit topic in this sub titled 2 guests in Ferry fate episode, we see the two characters in the backround, although it's unclear if they are in 2D or 3D.
        True, as a Seiyuu fan I am incredibly satisfied with how many interactions there are, like every characters all have special lines with everyone…if this is the case only for Gran I mean it’s normal but Cy did it for everyone, EVERYONE. 

I do love to see more DUOs coming, it’s just part of my personal taste to have a full four society team 
, so there might be an interesting chain burst line, like you know the four knights have one.  

The only problem I have with this game is I can’t pay more XD don’t wanna buy the color pack
I'm praying for Lobelia for the Evoker slot. One of them. Fairly popular. And his fighting style would be such a banger here. Plus Tower would easily make a flashy entrance and work for an SBA.
    My guess is either Lobelia or Fraux if we're going two beyond Nier. The rest I think are just not very popular or stand out enough. Maybe Geisonborger, because that man would be very interesting to translate into Relink though we probably have enough male draphs for now.
        Maybe I just am an unapologetic Lobelia simp. And I'd like to see him featured for once. Since he'll never outshine Caim in the base game.
i'm sorry if it's a dumb question, i'm new to the granblue universe, Jeanne is an original character or it is a collab with Fate ? She is very similiar to Jeanne D'arc from Fate series...
    Its a different version of Jeanne D'arc based on the actual person, there's even a J-Alter version here. They're kind of similar, but Granblue also literally has a Romeo and Juliet and they got guardian spirits because sure.
        Oooo thanks for that!!! I need to go search for the series Lore.
    She is originally from Rage of Bahamut and she can also be found in Shadowverse and Draglia Lost. She is one of their more iconic characters. In GBF she is a saint of Bahamut who is given the mission of combat Otherworlder intrusions. 

She is also a prominent character in the Rage of Bahamut: Genesis anime.
Oh yes, Monika please!
The game is ultimately a fanservice for fans who have been waiting for their favorite characters in this type of game. It's nice to have 'representation' or w/e but they still have shit to sell.
    Well my point is that there are other popular groups who have no playable characters and those should take priority over the popular groups who *do*.

They can absolutely sell Vikala, Fediel, or Sandalphon to more people than Beatrix or Ilsa.
    Yeah and they could sell units with Albert, Anne, Grea, Heles etc also since they are one of the more popular units they have. 

Hell Grea/Anne is prominent in *several* of their franchises and even got a stand alone anime about them.
Yeah 2 is enough, I already think all 4 of the DKs was honestly a mistake, probably one of my biggest complaints since there is so many groups who don't even have one representative yet.

No Yuel/Socie/You/Kou, Heles/Naoise/Scathacha/Seruel, Albert/Minnah/Yurius, Lecia/Monika, Evoker, Vintage weapon user, Grea/Anne and probably some other group I am forgetting about.
Since Lucilliua is coming to the game as a hardcored boss as advertised, I don’t know if Sandy, this archangel with a equivalent power, will be on our ship…

Maybe he would be an assist like Rolan?
    Sandalphon is kinda equivalent to Lucilius, but even if he was added, he wouldn't be the strongest on our ship. That role will almost always go to the captain or Seofon, as those two are *absurdly* powerful.
Hopefully, but come on, look at versus, 2 Belial, Beelze, Lucilius, but no Sandy xD
I am kinda worried about the power issue cuz since he’s so powerful, isn’t making him a playable character downplayed his strength a bit? Like get insta killed by two goblins lol
    Seofon (who's coming in April) if he "fully tries" and depending on the timeline (don't ask) is effectively a cosmic threat. In fact all the Eternals can be quite dangerous if fully left unchecked, but Seofon especially is dangerous.

Zeta and Vaseraga fought off a moon alien invasion full of giant robots.

>!Id!< is also quite powerful given their connection to >!Bahamut!<

Captain/Gran/Djeeta/Danchou with Lyria can summon Proto Bahamut who beyond Lyria's stamina issues can in-theory just kill any island with enough time, Bahamut is effectively the life and death cycle of the universe personified in a big kaiju dragon. Proto is a fraction of that power.

The power scaling in GBF goes from "Some old former master swordsman who fishes" to "I am a cosmic level threat to the world"

Don't over think it.
        Hah Yoda isn't even close to the floor for power scaling either thanks to all the SR and R characters you also have someone's grandma that makes crackers for everyone, a single mom looking for shopping bargains, various children pretending to be heroes or ninjas, and of course a child who isn't even dumb enough to be brave and just sits there terrified holding a knife but not attacking.
            I just forget the SR/R characters exist because Cygames doesn't do anything with them until they get the SSR treatment like Juri. But I used Yoda simply because he's actually in this game so people here will know him and he's fairly low key compared to even many SSRs given we got "infused by (probably) draconic powers", or "super caster person", or "I'm the biggest giga chad of my kingdom" levels of clout being part of the many many SSR GBF characters without even factoring things like Primal Beasts and what not. I think the only characters I can think of who are notably lower would be like Tsubasa/Sho with their casual over the top motorcycles or magical musician characters like Selfira.
                Hmm for SSR characters realistically at the bottom ranks I would also consider Herja, Jin, Volenna, and Juri as melee fighters who are probably better than anyone they know before they joined the crew, but don't offer any magical or other powers beyond that to compete with the real powerhouses. ...but the real hot take is that Vane belongs in that group too lol.
                    Yeah Vane is pretty much the worst Dragon Knight power scaling wise by design, its to obviously contrast him with Lancelot. I forgot Herja even existed as an SSR because she was so terrible lol.
                Uh, anytime we see Yoda lately in the gacha he's seen butting heads with Aletheia or Yngwie for old times' sake and their fighting causes earthquakes across whatever poor island they're on.
    Seofon is being added and he is one of the most powerful characters in the lore. People won't mind so long as their favourite is in.
    Considering they are adding Seofon who is top tier in the verse, I don't think that would be an issue.
I didn’t know that XD MAO sang is truly a treasure.

Zodiac and Evokers are quite popular as I heard of, their weapons look interesting too. In fact I saw a Japanese site claiming that they would be likely be introduced to the game. 

今後のアップデートで追加が予想されるキャラ on games8 is where I found the info.
He took the mantle of Supreme Primarch after Lucifer's death, and has been tried so far to redeem himself from his past sins by trying to look over the skies like Lucifer had done.
Zoi gameplay wise has never been really a tank in the way you'd expect. Her normal light version which is what is featured in the art there is actually a dodge tank with a heavy emphasis on dodging and getting a nuke as a result of dodging (remember gbf mobile is basically turn based final fantasy). 

Dark zoi is the breaker of balance and will likely never be acknowledged by cygames again. She has a skill that takes your teams hp to 1, gives them invincible for a turn and a very high healing cap drain. She single handedly broke the meta in such a ridiculous way the next two years of content were made in such a way to prevent her use.

I've been joking that if she comes to relink they'll give her the skill and it will break relink balance in the same way lol.
    > Dark zoi is the breaker of balance

Its funny because Dark Zooey is actually not even that good anymore which says many things about the state of the Dark Element, and it has little to do with the content denying her and more to do with how insane dark is as an element.

I don't think Conjunction if they translated into Relink would be that crazy in this game, it was broken in OG GBF because enmity was one of the easiest ways to hit damage cap thresholds and Garrison made dying difficult. But Relink's caps are easy to hit with any reasonable build and everything that can kill you does practically one shot damage so garrison synergy is irrelevant. It'd probably be like a marginally better Vane Rampart or Katalina Enhanced Invincible buff at best, which is very good but not that out of line.
        I don't think she would be good in any element regardless really. Conjunction bot is just not good enough any more since all elements got better healing, better defensive buttons and the enmity isn't really a thing any more, you simply don't need the raw attack power of being at 1hp.
    Ah, I see. Thanks for the breakdown.
    She was so broken that despite her being a summer unit they re-classified her as a grand unit.
You miss baotorda
I guess that is true.
Oh agreed, Kumbhira is my preferred choice of the Zodiacs. I only said Vikala because she's the most popular.

And I think you can probably swing one of the Six Dragons if you focus on their individual aspects over their overarching lore.
    I suppose when thinking about their lore, since this is a different timeline to the gacha game. Are the 6 dragons the same since their event showed they would be different in other universes even if all the other characters looked the same.
        As far as we know, that rule only applied to Orologia's simulations.

Alternate universe versions of the Six Dragons have already shown up in other events.
Oh really? That opens up quite a lot possibilities
    Ya the Ares thing is funny because it happens like 100ish chapters after when this story is supposed to happen.
I probably would too, but Cygames needs to remember Jin exists ~~and give him an SSR that isn't terrible~~.
Yes he is. He's just more of a magic swordsman instead of a traditional one.
I think supportive set ups are valuable enough in Relink, Danchou Substitute + Katalina/Vane invincibility is super funny. It just isn't the pure buffer kind. Plus imo being someone like Ferry who generate SBA super fast is a pretty supportive role because you effectively stun lock the boss if you time your stuff right. Like Ferry might as well be an enabling support in practice with how Proto Baha work because she makes sure Baha doesn't fly off so your party can just stomp his face into the floor. That's probably far more important then anything the DPS are actually doing in terms of ensuring the fight goes as smooth as it does.

But I think damage cap is a more interesting system when caps are actually hard to hit, as shown in actual GBF.
    Ask us poor Rosetta players how valid being a support feels...
        As I said:

> It [support that's valuable] just isn't the pure buffer kind

I know that, but there's still supportive enablers in this game just Rosetta isn't one of them unfortunately.
            Fair. 'Buffers' have a shitty life. Offensive supports are eating fairly good.
Yup, I am down with completing the whole society team, besides LIsa is a range character too right? We do need more range characters.

I am also very interesting in what would they say when chain burst ultimate, the four knights got one so why not give the same love to the society?
Yea, I wish they could release Lecia, but unlikely. What we do know is that one of the new coming ups that swordsman is wind element, the other archer is light.
    oh i definitely would've thought seofen the swordsman to be light and tweyen wind
    We'll probably get Monika before we get Lecia, which is probably fine anyway as Monika has probably better gameplay potential.
        Ohhh but only if that is going to happen :( I don’t think both of them on any priority.
Siete is coming for wind at least.
She’s got a huge rifle, like almost taller than herself. Her skill in the original GBF tho is the same as Rackam. You can check her wiki page. https://gbf.wiki/Silva

Tbh she’s probably more like huge dmg one shot type? Maybe charge shooting?
    Eugen has charged shooting and he has a mode called SNIPER VISION with tremendous range. Action game wise they'd be extremely similar.

Not impossible for her to come, but extremely similar base mechanics. I think what makes her not come into relink by a long-shot is the fact they wanna make the face of the franchise, so using chars other people know more (like the GBF Versus ones) is prefferable.

And even if they'd use unknown chars, it would be from factions already on both games (DK, society and etc).
This is what I was looking for! Thx
Fraux has probably one of the better chances for sure. I can see her or Lobelia very equally possible unless Cygames wants to put a Harvin in like they did when they picked Uno/Anre in Versus.
