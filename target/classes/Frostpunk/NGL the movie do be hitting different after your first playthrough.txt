[[NGL the movie do be hitting different after your first playthrough]]





The issue is Wilfords idea was inherently unsustainable, megalomaniacal, and deliberately designed with his disdain for the poor in mind. It wasn't him altruistically saving the world, it was his megalomania convincing him to play God. It's an incredibly fascist argument to say Wilford was in any sense right. He never held the people's best intentions in mind, and if he could elevate himself to a Godhead without having to wave anyone but himself he'd do it.
    And the frustrating thing is that the movie could easily made it so that some kind of authoritative system would make sense. Just like in Frostpunk with limited resources and space with harsh living conditions would force the leader to commit morally questionable decisions (at least in our society). But no. It's easier to make him just an asshole who lived in luxury (and some other people too) just because. Instead of having basically aristocracy with no clear function in the train, you could have where people doing hard, difficult and crucial work gets loads of resources for their family and friends, so the competition for those jobs would be intense. If you slack of even a little, you risk to be replaced and losing all benefits.
        Well yes it is interesting concept to make authoritarianism as a necessity in harsh times. But think of the lords who were trying to fuck over the poor and were more interested in saving their wealth than people. 

Some people are bad because they are bad. They create inequality not because they have to but because they enjoy having luxuries.
            Undoubtedly there are bad people in places of power. But I don't think even in those cases things are as simple as "Me have power, I keep power and I has luxury!". Even selfish people in power must keep in mind how they can keep their position if they want to have a long reign (or life). There's a great video of [Rules for rulers](https://youtu.be/rStL7niR7gs) which explains well how in powerful position you need to make sure you keep certain people happy and supporting you. Even in such ~~dystopic societies as North Korea~~ **FREE AND PROSPEROUS DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA** the dear leader has to keep at least the army and it's commanders content. If they diss the military too much, they won't rule much longer. North Korea can keep its citizens in objective poverty and despair because the nation's wealth isn't produced by them, but by Koreans working aboard and economic aid from mostly China (who wants buffer zone to capitalist South Korea).

In historical examples nobility in feudal system didn't have special rights because they were born different or because of divine blessings. Kings and emperors needed to keep their vassals happy, because kingdoms military strength came from those vassals. If high lords were unhappy with the king/queen, they soon found more suitable (agreeable) contender for the throne. And king's vassals had their own vassals they needed to keep happy and so on. And because heavily armoured knights were so OP in medieval warfare, the system was stable for over millennia. It was only after guns became cheaper and economic more focused on middle class (rather than farming) that old nobility lost its key role in the nation. The French Revolution wasn't successful because people just then started to think that maybe they don't need upper classes. It was because at that times nobles key role was diminished so much they couldn't keep their power. 

Is this the case in Snow Piercer? As far as I remember, no. And that's bothers me so much. There's no reasons why some people lives good life and others don't.

        The TV show actually hits on this quite a bit give or take the aristocracy still existing. Season 2 is actually pretty based with their portrayel of wilford vs the survival of the train.
    This is part of why I preferred the show's version of the train, it was clear that Wilford never actually cared about saving anyone, and just wanted to do a fallout-esque thing where he played god. He even tried to destroy the train saying if he couldn't have it, no one could. 

And while obviously still bleak, unlike the movie, it's clear that there's still hope for humanity, and like in on the edge, a future is still possible.
    Wahhh why don't they let us vote as refugees.

The poor didn't get tickets, they were accepted on at the close of everything.

Democracy has no value in survival.
        Democracy has value anywhere. When times are hard, authoritarianism is tempting, but ultimately it takes power away from the very people you were hoping to save.
            Democracy has no value, in snowpiercer it was the democratic free states lead by experts who froze the world and confined mankind to the fate it suffers.

Even less than toleration it should be mocked and disregarded as a valid idea.

The people don't need power they need security and to be looked after.
                Calm down Palpatine
                    Calm down *Putler*
            Democracy wouldn't work on snowpiercer or in most dystopian scenarios. When you let everyone have a voice that means stupid people can get the other stupid people on board with whatever bullshit they think will save everyone. 

I love democracy with all my heart but the fact of the matter is outside of a small group it'd just cause more problems than it would solve.
        It's a metaphore; The poor and refugees don't get any say or input, yet they provide all the work and suffering, merely on the excuse that they are the poor and the refugees.
SPOILER


And worst of all they destroy the train lmao. And the survivors get eaten by polar bears
    That part was so dumb. Like. Okay, there are >!these 2 kids. Even if they survive the next few years, 2 people is never enough to make it through the bottleneck. Maybe they find other survivors or something? Oh, no, it's a polar bear. Nothing says "there is hope for mankind" like seeing the only animal that is known to actively track, hunt and eat humans.!<
        Well... I imagine that was the point, the moral of the movie is that there is no hope for mankind.
            Nah the moral is, captain is always right and everyone else fucked themselves by revolting

They’re lucky he didn’t demand 100% child labour or 24 hour shifts smh
            Yeah, I guess
The thing i wondered is why they needed a train , why dont stop and disconect the engine shaft and build a city around it?
    I haven’t seen the movie since it came out but the series at least tried to explain that the perpetual motion engine requires speed because..... reasons.
        I havent seen it since then too. But having it make around the globe trip was so absurd.

I guess they will make up some bs reason in the series.
            I think it was a tourist train before the world ended. It was designed to operate for an entire year going around the world. Wilford just saw the end of the world as an opportunity to make sure the train never stopped running.
        cant you just put 2 of it on a rotor?
    I don't remember the sci-fi/frostpunk justification for keeping the train, but I think the strongest takeaway from the train is as an allegory for capitalism or the power structure of society, a big theme in the story (also in Parasite). 

People argue that you can't stop/change capitalism and its power structure because society would collapse. Same with climate change and our dependence on carbon. 

It's amusing that things didn't go so well in the movie when you interpret it this way. On one hand, society did fall apart. On the other, they did stop the train, which people didn't believe could be done. Maybe things could have ended better if others on the train were more open to things being done differently? I'm not sure what to take from it.
    Everywhere outside the train appears to be too cold for anyone to even survive 50 meters of walking from what we saw with the 7 frozen guys outside the train in the film.

    It is indeed better to live free rather than as an slave, but you should know freedom is subjected to perspective. For instance, probably everyone here would agree that we have more freedom than them due to the simple fact that we are not confined to a train, even if we had the whole train for ourselves. Some of you might think: "Well, I would prefer to have that train to myself rather than the life I am leading now.". If someone thought that, he is willing to trade the freedom he has for commodities in life. Nowadays, we willingly do this exchange, the tailers had no choice. But were really all of them eager to renounce their lives, the few commodities they had, for "more" freedom? I could say that maybe not, that it was Gilliam and Wilford leading them to revolt, but I do not really know. It is a movie in the end and we are only making assumptions but, personally, I like to think that maybe they already preferred going out, even if they died, they wanted to die fighting and maybe even touching that nostalgic, or new and exciting for some, soil. It was a harsh environment at the end and while not as unforgiving as in many other dystopian societies, this one was filled with an air of hopelessness, so maybe they just wanted to go out fighting, at least I believe so.
    I disagree.....you are using book and movie knowlage. In reality most people preffer life over death and any life is worth living....think of all the slaves in the ancient rome out of the hundreds of thousands only a few decided to fight for their freedom...the ones that were trained in fighting and risking their lifes every day...and they had atleast a chance of winning
        Eh, most people don’t like hearing the truth. I live in a country where they’re are plenty of people living in conditions comparable to that of people in snowpiercer but they still push on because just as you say, “they want to live”. 

It’s often those living the high life that can freely espouse the whole, “if life is hard and harsh then what’s the point in living” concept.
Naah Wilford is an Idiot^^
    He ain’t no saint, but even a good guy would resort to such harsh tactics. I mean, imagine playing endless mode in frostpunk for the first time and your first time is also your only chance to get it right or you suffer perma-death. To top it off, you don’t have any internet videos or forums to give you tips on what to do. 

I don’t know many that can say they can achieve that
        tbh if you were playing endless for the first time you would die a bit after the first storm
Poor Charlie. The oompa loompas all died and he needed children to run the damn train they built for oompa loompa proportions.
    His new chocolate bars also suck
I assume you're talking about the movie. 

Yeah the people in the tail stepped out of line. I do kinda think they could have been treated better but at the same time they were trespassers and didn't really do anything for train. For the train to survive it'd have to be a carefully regulated ecosystem and that's what Wilford was doing. It's kinda shitty to say, "Well the tailies should of just died with everyone else during the freeze," but they kind of should have.
I never understood the scene about them being disgusted by bugs being turned into food, it is smart to use bugs as they can be farmed easily into food and it is more moral than other meats
LMFAO i havnt watched snowpiercer since ive played frostpunk.  Thoroughly enjoyed it when i watched years ago.  With that said, every fucking post I see from this subreddit makes me want to play frostpunk...so naturally thats what ill be doing for the rest of my night.  Let my 3rd winterhome playthrough commence, i will be attempting to fill that dreadnought 100% this time (medium diff, lets not get cute)
    My dreadnought was full and I had peaple left behind... their simply wasn't enough room...
Children for the future, engineers to keep it running, and as many workers as possible.

 Houses taken apart for scrap. steam hubs toppled and ripped apart to make the dreadnought cabins just a bit larger. 

The day the generator shook it last and blew its last black smog ridden breath. 

Many family's where split that day. 
Some stole food and left for the dreadnought. I let them I figured at least some child would have it's parents.

In the end I shut it down and let the cold take them before the explosion
The TV show is better anyways 😤
Read the comics, in the 3rd comic the find an outpost with a reactor.
SP series or the movie?
    I think OP specifies that it's the movie in the title
    still works for both, Melanie wasn't a bad leader, sp wilford is like the previous captain in wintherhome
        Melanie is super duper.
Okay but it’s very hard to play as a good guy in frostpunk. Myself and Wilford are both the bad guys in the snow apocalypse
    Rather easy in most scenarios.
Don't use child labor.
Soup instead of sawdust even if they hate it.
No where's and no dueling.
Viola not evil.

Once u hit faith don't bring in the whipping crew and declare yourself the messiah.

Once in dictator don't declare your word law they already listen anyway.
Oh and don't make them sell each other out that's a Russian peice.
