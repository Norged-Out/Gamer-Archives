[[Speaking from experience as a new player]]





Yeah, that storm is the closest I've seen in a city builder to a boss fight
    TBF the way there is more of a boss fight as if you've survived that long surviving the storm won't be that much of a problem
Yeah, the music is top notch and def lets.you know yer about to get savaged.
Those violins do slap though
That sums up my new player experience perfectly - "is this fucking *boss music* in a city builder?"
The music be lit tho. The City Must Survive kinda reminds me of Vivaldi’s Winter, the way it portrays harsh winter storm. I would literally go on a music theory rant on why that particular song resonates well.

My favorite song from Piotr Musial so far.

Then again judging from their previous game This War of Mine, pretty sure the him and the rest of the devs really know how to present a desperate, hopeless situation but leaves enough hope for you to want to keep continuing.

The great storm is the powerful example, outfreezing your entire heat infrastructure and killing off lots of people, yet I still want to hold on until tomorrow. It’s a similar feeling I find throughout the game and This War of Mine, but this... this one is something else. It made me stick even when I lose half of my population. 

Probably one of the best boss fights.

Tldr: song good. storm good.
    Ha more like 99% population really
I love that music, but I was so unprepared the first time, it almost traumatised me. I swear I had one save for every 5 minutes of gameplay and I could never control the lack of resources and medical needs.

In short: "Why do I hear boss music?"
I just experienced today. Had no idea how bad it would be. Found myself cussing as I watched my Empire crumble in front of me. "-100°c? Is that even possible to survive?! -110° wtf is this shit!? -120°?!!... Why does it say there are more temperature drops ahead... "

Along with "Shut the hell up you ungrateful pricks, you try keeping 300 people warm in -120° weather. This thing is already at peak overdrive, and we have no coal because yall keep saying 'im sick' and 'everyone is dying'. Deal with it if you want to live"

I was executed....
    Did you use the execution platform? It basically cuts discontent in half in exchange for a citizen. Very useful in the late game when you're in that position. People often forget to use it if they have it.
        Really. Yeah I forgot to use it, honestly didn't remember I could use it whenever I felt. To be fair my city was already collapsing this was my final straw.
            Fair enough. Hopefully you saved.
                I did but I just accepted defeat. I'll start a new save that I'll do better at with my new found knowledge

                    Awesome, hope it goes better for you!
    bruh my city reached -150 lol

I was slapped around, but some-fuckin-how, my first city didn’t die, and I barely made it out, with 30 seconds left on the clock as i just ran out of coal, so I was literally on a few pieces of food and a prayer until I hit the ending point.
        Damn. I died before then so I wasn't able to enjoy the recovery lol
    My city was thriving at the end (first playthrough on medium after reading a couple guides). I didn't expect the storm to get worse and worse. I turned on my emergency power to keep people warm. My core blew up a couple hours before the storm ended x.x. Woops.
        Steamcore > child
    I got it on my fourth try, last two days of the storm I was literally toggling the overdrive on and off and had all my mechs on coal duty. Came within a hairbreadth of blowing up the generator but I made it out with 400 plus people.
Frostpunk is probably the only city building I play while listening to the game music. It's so good.
All these new memes from players are giving us life, keep them coming! And it's great to hear so many people are giving Frostpunk a try - hope you all enjoy the DLCs as well, beyond the base game!
    Where is our custom scenario support Joanna?

Tell me or I'll toss the kids into the freezing mine
The music in this game is so good. One of the reasons I keep playing it every now and then
"Oh, I'm doing good on coal, we'll be fi- ooooooohhhhh my fucking god."
Mate... The first time I saw the storm i literally felt like freezing, and i was watching an YouTuber finish it
i just barely fucking made it through my first new home playthrough. everyone was starving and im pretty sure i triggered the first cabalism event with someone being missing.
i pick this game from epic, and i thought it would be a easy game to manager, my mistake
You poor summer child you have no idea what you got into.
I was exiled because they blamed me for the weather getting worse, far as I'm concerned
My first time playing on medium I didn’t even reach day 20. Tried again on easy and managed to beat the storm, but holy fuck I’m surprised so many survived without heat
You made it through the storm, Beet?
Cuppa times
If you like that you should play Agajnst The Storm
