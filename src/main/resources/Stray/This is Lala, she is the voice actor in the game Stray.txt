When she said *meow* that hit me
    I know you‚Äôre joking, but the fall scene stills hurts my heart üò≠
        Bro I feel u, I meowed up at the other cats and I made myself almost cry bc I was so sad üò≠üò≠
            Bruh i know it was like right at the beginning but i had to pause and go shove my face into my cats belly cause it hurt me so bad
                No, same, I almost just uninstalled
                    I fucking haven‚Äôt played it past that part!
                        lmao
                Haha I cried like a baby then gave each of my cats kisses like a psycho.
        Oh gosh and then after the fall scene when the kitty gets up but it‚Äôs limping.. I had to stop and hug my kitties for a bit.
            Same. The game just looked like a futuristic cat simulator from the clips I had seen prior to purchase, I was not expecting it to get so intense.
            THIS DAMN GAME AND THE ATTACK ON CAT OWNERS EMOTIONS IT DOES
        The fall scene broke my heart and I cried üò≠üò≠üò≠
        Can we talk about when the roof opens up ü•≤
        There are several moments in the game that will hurt your heart. I was just expecting a light hearted little cat game, but it's actually a pretty touching story that stayed with me a long time after it was over.
            I played it again as soon as finished it. Seeing this post makes me want to play it again. I LOVED the world the developers built.
        Wait... but how did they get that audio? Oh no...
            She's a very talented actress
                Catress*
            I feel like if you just attached a mic to a talkative cat and waited 24 hours that would be adequate
        Okay, I had to stop and I haven‚Äôt gone back‚Ä¶because I couldn‚Äôt stop crying since my cat was on my lap when I was playing‚Ä¶does it get worse or better?! üò≠üò≠
            You serious ? It‚Äôs a great game just play it.
        My daughter lost her fucking mind
        I just watched that for the first time on a YouTube LP and I just started sobbing and had to go and find my own little ginger kitten and hug him, had a full on breakdown on my stairs about anything happening to him - I'm unbothered when people get hurt in video games but my god, I'm actually traumatised over watching a cat fall
        I think all the videos of people's pets watching that scene and getting VERY UPSET shows how universal that sentiment is.
    That moment I knew Thatcher is definitely dead.
    Her Performance was Meowtastic!

    Which is more than most people on /r/antiwork can say.
Nice to see they used real actors who can relate instead of dressing someone up as a cat to fake it.
    Shame they couldn't get Chris Pratt
        What about Chris Catt?
            He's so cool
                Is that a line he says?
                    When Nintendo unveiled him as the voice of Mario in the Mario movie that's literally all they said about him... "Starring as Mario, it's Chris Pratt, he's so cool."
                        Chris Catt and Chris Pratt are completely different actors. Nintendo got confused.

They casted the wrong actor.
                            Also once they caught their mistake they forgot to remove that line where Mario goes "meow".
                                *movie writers sweating as they re-write the entire script to change Mario from a cat to Chris Pratt*
                        Dunkey really liked that one lol
                        But is he cool , i always thought he was an okay kind of guy
                            Depends on a few factors, that.
                        I thought Danny DeVito was the obvious choice (also a national treasure), but ya can‚Äôt win em all can you
            Nah we got crisp rat

            You win today, tomorrow, will be another day!
        I don't think he would nail the accent.
            They can just say that the cat is doing its best Chris Pratt impression.
            He wouldn't need it, he'd just use his regular voice!
        Why would you want a crisp rat playing a cat?
        They got Priss Cat, arguably better.
        Christopher Prattle is such a good va

                Why
                    evidently, "I l6lilii"
        I.... Don't get it
            I think it maybe a reference to getting Chris Hemsworth, an Austrailian, to play Thor, a norse god from Scandinavia. Aka, getting people far removed from a culture to play someone in it. Or its in relation to Rebel Williams. Idk, I could be wrong, it could be a meme thing I'm not aware of.
            Maybe a reference to Tropic Thunder, with Robert Downey Jr playing as Kirk Lazurus, an Australian method actor casted to play an African American black man.

But then again Aussies playing characters of other countries is fairly typical.
        This is the same as faking it because Australia doesn't actually exist
            Shhh! We‚Äôre not supposed to tell anyone that!
            Its just a bunch of spiders those cunts made it all up
                If you ever meet someone who claims to be Australian, it's actually 10,000 spiders in a human suit.
                    I mean with the wack ass shit they have that doesnt sound that far fetched
        Is this not a Wilfred reference?

So, your average cat. Check.
                For that matter, your average child.
                    Shit I have an old cat who never misses a chance to give me a long winded lecture about how he doesn't approve of the way I do things around here.
                To some extent, sure, but we've had more than half a dozen cats since we got married, and, well, he goes waaaaay beyond.
            "He thinks that he's entitled to *absolutely everything*."

Sooo... a cat?
                We have had a lot of cats, and, well, yeah, but he goes *above and beyond*.
            You can't just go and tell us about your primadonna retired show cat and not even provide us with cat tax!  I'm sure your cat would be really disappointed with you if he found out you weren't sharing his beautiful face with the world ...

Biggest VA of the year snub. Would have had a shorter acceptance speech too.
    The entire speech would consists of pushing the microphone off the podium, followed by the award.
        > The entire speech would consists of pushing the microphone off the podium,

Then quickly running to the edge of the podium and staring at the floor where the microphone dropped as if surprised, then looking back at you to see your response as well.
        Too close to the actual game.
            There's a reason she embodied that character so well.
        Method catcting!
        Standing ovation
    Who owns the cat? I came to the comments to get the back story but everyone is just talking about the game or cat memes. Is this one of the dev's cats or did they hire some company? How does one find a cat for voice acting? OP don't leave us hanging, what's the deal with Lala? I hate it when users post something interesting then don't explain anything in the comments
        I know nothing about this cat in particular, but she was probably trained for film/TV (like the character Goose in Captain Marvel, a cat in a cat food commercial, or the monkey in Pirates of the Caribbean). To take another guess, the cat may be naturally chatty, and so the trainer worked to develop her into performing different types of vocalizations on cue (a cute meow, hissing, yowling, etc). After the casting director got over their initial "I have to cast what now?!" they probably started asking around in the niche animal actor community and someone was like "Oh, I have the perfect cat!". Other considerations that the casting director probably had to account for (besides a cat who sounded appropriately cat-like) would be the range of vocalizations the cat can perform, their willingness to perform in an unfamiliar sound studio (I heard they were worried Goose wouldn't like the actors in their alien costumes since they were totally unfamiliar), their willingness to perform directly in front of a microphone, and their willingness to perform over and over again (I think Jack the monkey could be difficult to work with at times because he got bored of doing the same thing).
            >I know nothing about this cat in particular

let me stop you right there.
                I mean, the person they responded to *did* ask just ‚Äúhow does one find a cat for voice acting?‚Äù In addition to asking about this particular cat, but still just in general.
                I mean I don't know anything about the world of animal acting but they seem like a huge nerd about it lol. They're just offering an inference based on their existing knowledge for anyone who doesn't feel like googling it

I found it informative
                    sorry i just found the preface funny.
        Don't worry, all your questions have answers. They won't be here tho, because that's just OP's random cat.
    Yeah but think about how many steam decks could be won with a longer acceptance speech
    Comment of the year right here, folks.
After I beat Stray I watched a few different people play it and it blew my mind how rarely any of them meowed lol. I don't think I saw anyone get the achievement for meowing x number of times. Meanwhile I got it within the first thirty minutes of the game lol. My entire playthrough was step meow step meow step repeat seven hours.
    My favorite was scratching stuff and tripping people. I really related to my cats when I was doing those things.
        Running that one chess game
        My four year old plays and will spend 30 mins just tripping robots. Then he‚Äôll spend another 30 knocking over every single paint can and flower pot he can find. Truly gets the cat experience
    This game depressed me for some reason. Maybe cause I have 4 cats and can‚Äôt imagine losing any of them or they being separated.

Only game that has had that affect on me.

            Right I think that‚Äôs what got me as she lost her good friend but you never get a satisfying ending.

                Fun fact:
I haven‚Äôt played any of the Watch Dog games but supposedly there are no dogs in Legion because the simulation that accounts for the relationships between all the NPCs in the game would have to account for dogs or any effect on dogs when something happened to their owner and they just didn‚Äôt want to deal with that.
            In fable 2, I sacrificed the world to save my dog, no hesitation.
            Me getting excited playing Kenshi when one of my guys arms gets cut off and my dog picks it up off the ground and runs around with it for a while before eating it.
            Omg we get it, John Wick. Go home already. üòí
        I rushed through that game because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep soundly until I saw the kitty get home safe to his kitty friends üòøüß°
            Good news! Some people traced the cat's steps and figured out where you exit the city is actually right around the corner from where you entered. The cat should be close enough to reunite with his family.
            You‚Ä¶saw that happen?

Did we play the same game?
                Super secret ending that only one person has ever gotten.
                wasn't there a meow right offscreen?
                    Not that I noticed, but if a single meow is heard offscreen, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a clear indication the cat is reunited with a bunch of other cats. A chorus of meows? Sure.
            I‚Ä¶ have bad news for you
            Sounds like you never even played to the end or didn‚Äôt play it at all
                I did and I was disappointed; I just didn‚Äôt want to spoil it here for other folks
            Damn you must not be sleeping very good still. I‚Äôm sorry a virtual cat messed you so up.
        You‚Äôre right it‚Äôs so depressing. Gotta go back to mass genocide in CoD to cheer myself up.
        That definitely saddened me too. If you want to fuck up yourself some more I recommend The Last Guardian.
    I got that same achievement in like 40 minutes lol, because I thought it was cool at the part where the cables shake when you meow. After that not much though.
    I was the same! I would meow constantly, a lot of times just sitting there meowing. I thought it was so cute. What a magnificent game.
    My husband watched me play (he's the better gamer by far but he said it was more fun to watch me enjoy it) and he was not surprised at all when I got that achievement within the first 5 minutes of gameplay. The meow button was one of my favorite parts of that game lol
    The second I figured out I could press button to meow I was mashing that mf
    Same. Meowed almost constantly. 

And then I got to the stealth section

And forgot that meowing is in fact not very stealthy

^(meow)
    I did it just like you. I was meowing, all. The. Time. Meow meow meow as I did everything. Loved that game.
    I got the achievement in my first play through. I don‚Äôt remember how long it took me.
        I got it in the city I just kept meowing while exploring the place also I would meow a bunch after dialogues
    I got "sleep for an hour" achievement almost first thing. I had left the game open on accident before I went to bed,  and I decided to sleep in-game before I saved. I think it was the 4th achievement I got, the one before was meowing 100 times. I got all of the being-a-cat related achievements before getting to the big tree city thing which was scratching things and jumping 500 times.
    Same, haven't finished it but I've been meowing at everything. Once I saw it light up a string of lights I was like... What other secrets does meowing hold?!
    Seriously... I spent a lot of time just doing stuff... finding all the spots to chill at and let the cat nap.. it was a chill experience. Also the paint.. and making paw prints.
    My brother was way too happy with the fact that you could meow during cutscenes. I don't think there was a cutscene that he wasn't meowing through.
Kinda messed up that there are plenty of ethnically orange actors, but they went with another gray actress.
    Tbf, I understand the director wanting to deal with an actor who has more than one brain cell.
        I agree, every orange cat I've ever met hasn't exactly been the sharpest.
            I had an orange cat who was really smart.  Came when called, had whole conversations with me, etc.  She ended up dying young of a seizure, so apparently there's a biological hard limit for orange cat computation.
                I've known three, one lost the ability to turn while sprinting causing him to crash into things while all amped up, one likes to sleep in the street for some reason, and the other tried starting a fight club with a bunch of raccoons.
                    > the other tried starting a fight club with a bunch of raccoons

I can entirely believe raccoons participating in a fight club.
                        Is that not the plot lot of Guardians 3?
                        Yeah, being like ‚ÄúMarmalade isn‚Äôt the sharpest raccoon we‚Äôve ever met, but we let him join us because we value inclusivity.‚Äù
                            "Boss, why do we call him 'Marmalade'?"

"Damn it Jimmy he's fuckin' Orange! What the hell else we're we gonna call him? Tang!? Think before you open that trash heap you call a mug!"

Also for some reason as I typed this it sounded in my head that all raccoons talk like they're from Brooklyn...all of them.
                    > one likes to sleep in the street for some reason

Literally what happened to my orange cat.  One day he didn't wake up in time.
                I grew up with an orange farm rescue. He had street smarts, knew how to get my bf‚Äôs attention before leading him to doors or the catnip stash. Caught rodents like a boss ( back before people were informed on the perils of outdoor cats), and had such a suave personality.
                So that's why the rest of the orange 'species' only has one brain cell to share.  Your cat took the rest to the grave :(
                    Despite being the most intelligent orange cat, he behaves exactly as they all do. It‚Äôs poetic, actually.

                    Yeah.  She had the most cat I'd ever seen in a single cat.
                Aw, poor kitty. I'm sorry :-(
        All cats share one 5th dimensional brain cell that pops into and out of existence based on observation.

        Cat racism? And you‚Äôre being upvoted for it? What has Reddit come to!

                    > I don't know how or when I became this person that is subbed to like 8 different cat subs but here we are with number 9

Those are rookie numbers.
                    Ah, a young cat sub-finder on their journey. Welcome young initiate.
                    Now that's a full cat life.
            This shit sickens me. Aren‚Äôt the mods gonna do anything?
                And you‚Äôre being downvoted for calling them out on it! The mods have turned, they support ginger cat discrimination it seems!
                    Be right back I gotta go make some picket signs and stand on a street corner about this
                The mods are also orange cats.
            Whoosh
            Reddit is the home of some truly racist groups. I'm not sure why you're surprised at the ginger hate.

EDIT: Well, that fell flat.
        r/oneorangebraincell
        You‚Äôre absolutely right. I love my little orange but she is in outer space all the time. Also idk if it‚Äôs all oranges or just mine but she doesn‚Äôt make normal cat noises üòÇ her meow is like a little tea kettle.
            Girl oranges are special. I mean, they're kinda rare, anyway, but they also tend to be *special* üòù
        My least talkative cat so far has been an orange tabby. Even when he does meow, which is infrequent, it's very quiet. My most talkative cat was a Russian blue and I dearly miss him. Interestingly enough, when he died recently, my next oldest male cat, a tuxedo, started meowing a lot more. I think he's taken the place of leader and representative of my cat pack. He's the one who tells me when a bowl needs filling and meows at me when I come home like his big bro used to do even though he didn't really do it before. It's been interesting to watch the shift in the hierarchy.
        Wow, man. Racist much?

            I love following the jorts account on twitter bc theyre focused on a lot of pro-union advocacy
                It‚Äôs crazy that a formerly buttered orange cat who can‚Äôt avoid the occasional trash can mishap is becoming the face of America‚Äôs unions. I am totally here for it.
        I downloaded the Jean and Jorts mod for Stardew Valley and I will never play a modded save without it.
    Idk if it‚Äôs cause the lighting in the pic or what, but I thought the cat was orange until reading this comment, but now when I look at it again, she looks grey. Brains sure are weird.
        She looks brown to me.
    You're supporting the male dominated orange cat voice actor field? Here's a female getting a shot for once, you disgust me.

Best voice actor 2022
    Can't find Lala's IMDB page.
Legitimately surprised it wasn't voiced by Chris Pratt.
    Phris Catt
    Alan Tudyk.
        Maybe he wanted to wash his hands of animal voicing.  Just drifted off to the next thing, almost like a leaf on the wind.
            Might have been a bit of a chicken after Moana.
                Damn, can't believe how easily I could have worked that in too.  Well done.
    He's so cool.

I heard she was hard-core Method, never broke character, and only spoke to crew and fellow actors in meows during rehearsals and shooting.
The cast of stray ‚ÄúWhere are they meow?‚Äù
    (Sorry commented on wrong comment)
I'm spamming Square in her honor
i wonder how many cats they auditioned till they found rhe right meow
    They should‚Äôve used my friends cat. She‚Äôs deaf and he‚Äôs (the cat) really dumb. He can‚Äôt tell when she‚Äôs got her cochlear off and so he makes every variation of cat noise pretty much constantly to get her attention
        That is very adorable
    Isn‚Äôt it just the devs cat?
We need an open world Stray 2 now. It should pick up directly after the first game ends.
    Stray 2 is going to be one of those games that takes what the first does and transcends an entire genre and defines what games are allowed to be going forward. The amount of care and love I saw in that first game convinced me that the sequel is going to be amazing. It reminds me of Portal in that way. Get a better story with better puzzles and more interesting use of mechanics and you've got a recipe for GoTY
        I wish lol. I don't think a game as short as Stray would have a chance for GOTY though. They'd need to make the second game way longer, at least double its predecessor.
            r/gaming on their way to downvote the only comment grounded in reality
        ‚Ä¶it‚Äôs what the hype will say, and then it won‚Äôt be able to ever deliver on all those expectations.
My cat could do this job. He never shuts the fuck up. So if anyone has any cat voice jobs hit me up.
    My cat will scream for an hour straight.

She‚Äôs not in pain. There‚Äôs nothing wrong. She just grabs a toy in her mouth and meow screams non stop.

Which character did she play?

    Happy cake day btw üéÇ
Where's her Oscar?
It's insane that they wont use her for the sequel.
But casting Danny DeVito instead was a really strange twist.
Meow that's nice to see.
I'm her biggest fan
I hope she was paid. Cats can't survive off 'thanks' and 'you'll get recognition'.
Prettiest voice actress
1 million dollars an hour
Finished that game this past weekend. Played entirely on my Steam Deck.  

Inspired by this little idiot. lol

I wish this game allowed you to customize your cat.
    Me too, I really couldn't connect with the protagonist because they didn't look exactly like my cat
ALL WORSHIP THE LALA!!!! HAIL!!!! WE MUST BRING HER GIFTS OF NUM-NUMS AND BOXES!!!
    All I got is this atomic battery. Sorry, best I can do.

    I found out from this article: https://screenrant.com/stray-cat-game-voice-actor-meow-sounds-lala/

Edit: accidentally pasted the wrong article
Stray prompted me to buy my first console, a PS4. Still learning how to work the buttons.
Shes a natural
That‚Äôs a good kitty!!!
Cats are adorable enjoy yours, my cat is currently dying he's in his last days :( 

I adopted him a month before I got my Wii in launch day he's been with me all the way up to current 9th gen consoles! So many good gaming memories with him on my side.
    Sorry for your struggles and wish you all the best.
    Sorry to hear. The poor little thing. Losing them is one of the hardest things to go through. I'll give mine extra hugs tonight.
        He just passed tonight a few hours ago :((

he was a fighter till the end.

    acktully lala identifies as a male
AHHHH I LOVE YOU LALA I HEARD YOU MEOW OVER A MILLION TIMES!!! ü´∂‚ù§ CAN I HAVE YOUR PAWTOGRAPH??!?! üòç
Stray was such a beautiful game
If she don't win an award the whole industry is rigged.
Oh great. Another animal more accomplished than me.
How does Lala feel about being replaced with AI voice actors?
I love her with my whole heart
She should do an AMA
Lala played her part perfectly! \^\^
I just finished Stray the other day and making the cat chirp and meow during cutscenes was one of my favorite things ever. Give her pets for me!
She will go on a rant when stray 3 will be release because the developers will only offer 3000 and that they should pay voice actors more, blablabla
The cutest voice actor ever.
What was she paid in? ü§®
    Treats! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm surprised they didn't use a dog.
I almost expected to see "Ask me anything" in the title lol.
Stray was GOTY for me.
Troy Baker should have gotten this part.
Proof
üòçüòª
Omg!!! A talking cat!
Will she be signing autographs on the convention circuit this summer?
Cute cat! I really need to finish this game.
You gotdam right she is.
**this** is the kind of celebrity news that I care about
That picture, she looks like she‚Äôs trying to figure out how to kill the person taking her picture‚Ä¶
I love you lala.
Is this verified?
Where is her back leg?
Source?
I want her pawtograph!
What lines did she have?
My dog is a huge fan
Source?
I was expecting a furry
In her Hollywoo hills mansion
She looks just like my Szyslak. However, he has done nothing notable with his life except turn my hair gray to match.
Where is the supporting cast?
Literally the only actor I've ever cared to meet
Method acting at its finest.
Wait is this legit?
nice cat!  the cats lines are meow!
I love her

Yes!! ü•∞ü•∞üòçüòç
Ok thanks for letting us know
Tabbies represent!
My cat could definitely get a job as a cat voice actor. She's great at meowing on demand. And without demand.
Absolutely beautiful, 10/10
Cute kitten!
Wow a celebrity!
I'm a huge fan of hers!
She's one of the only cats that can legally unionize.
Hope we get Stray II
Is there any proof at all ? Not saying I don't believe OP but this is just a picture of a cat lol
How much did she get paid?
Reminds me of my cat that I had to put down last year :(
Was expecting an ‚Äúask her anything‚Äù at the end of that sentence.
Peak acting
She did really well, but method acting is getting a bit far...
Does Lala do autographs?
The voice catress*
Adorable baby girl she diservers a gamer award.
Great job Lala.  My own cat was constantly looking for you while I was playing.
She was great
Press O to Lala.
I love this voice actor
I can't believe that game got nominated for game of the year.
    Well, the voice acting was on point.
    Why? It was beautiful, had incredible story telling and did something entirely unique.
        I agree! But not one thirds as good as Elden Ring/Ragnarok for it to be nominated aside them as if they're in the same range
            I liked it more than Elden Ring and haven't been able to play Ragnarok. 

Elden Ring was fun, but it was just open world Dark Souls with the same regurgitated plot as DS 1, 2 and 3.
                You can like a game more than other games and still acknowledge the game you liked less was better. People have different tastes, which is why for some people a niche 9/10 game is way more enjoyable than a broad 10/10 game. Stray is exactly that, a niche 9/10 game. Did I enjoy it more than a 10/10 game? Maybe. Doesn't mean the game is better, means I enjoyed it more.

To give you an analogy, lets say we have American football and then basketball. You don't like basketball and enjoy football more, but you can acknowledge that basketball is still a better sport to most people, therefore making it better.
                    I agree with your point but I think Stray was a better game than Elden Ring. Elden Ring isn't anything new or creative. It's a fun game, but it wasn't groundbreaking whereas Stray was. 

Also, American Football is a significantly better sport than Basketball which encourages fouling in the last two minutes.
                        How is stray even considered a game and in what world was that sack of mediocrity ‚Äúgroundbreaking‚Äù
                        Did you really just call a game where you hold forward, and press X to win "groundbreaking"? Fuck me.
                        Elden Ring wasn't groundbreaking? Lol, yes it was. It broke the internet. If Elden Ring isn't groundbreaking then Stray is an average game.

As for American Football, I agree its better to watch but basketball is infinitely more fun to play.
Deserves to be treated like a movie star with an acting reputation like that.
I'd love to see behind the scenes videos of the recording sessions
The first 30 seconds of this game is still a better live story than twilight.
Any stray cat could have been the cat voice actor for Stray.
Stray is overrated.
Awwwwww. Little meow.
Fun fact: she is about to star in the new Hairy Pawter game
Best actor
Bro is doing method acting
I was wondering why a photo of a cat got 50k+ upvoted and then I remembered *this is the internet*
    Welcome to the Internet, where cats mean everything and the points don't matter
They're taking our jerbs!
She did a great job! Congratulations, Lala.
Where‚Äôs the AMA?
Can she jump? Because you can't jump in stray
    Can you not jump seriously!?  This may be a deal breaker for me.  Was thinking of grabbing it on sale at some point.
        Only at interact points where a prompt appears.
            That's really disappointing for a game you play as a cat.  Thanks for the info!
                There are many prompts for places to jump in stray. There are some areas that are blocked with those pigeon spike type things, and obviously you can't jump from a height that will be fatal or leave the cat injured. Some areas have fewer jump spots, for challenge... It's no where near as bad as this person makes it out to be.
                you can jump on pretty much anything that would make sense to jump on or that you would need to. it's a really good game don't listen to the other guy definitely pick it up on sale
                    Yeah but I just envisioned jumping around willy nilly as I explored.  I probably still will, just seems like it will be less, immersive?
                        there's so much vertical environment in Stray that having free jump would make navigating the world way more difficult. seriously while playing if you look to any spot 9/10 times you can jump there. you just can't stand out in the flat open and jump up and down for no reason. watch some gameplay. the game is very immersive with a beautiful environment and you can very much explore around as you please.
                            More difficult, but a lot more fun.
                            I mean I guess cats don't often go around just randomly jumping.  It is typically more of a get in place and prepared type thing.  Still though, I just have a general disappointment in games that don't allow free jumping.
                                You should absolutely get the game. It's amazing. You can indeed jump on a bunch of stuff, and will spend a good part of the game doing so. You'll be climbing terrain, jumping from building to building and exploring like crazy.
                                    Yes, and that is ALL you do in the game. It wears out about 3 hours in.
                As a cat lover it bums me out. the beauty is in the details, and that detail seems to have been overlooked. Game on homie
                    I own cats and they don't usually just randomly jump unless they've been frightened.

In stray the cat can jump onto anything that makes sense for a cat to jump onto.
                        So they only jump up in predetermined spots where the blue skittles pops up?
                            Its a relaxing adventure/puzzle game not a domestic feline simulator....
                                I'm aware what it is. I'm also aware of what it's not. It's not for me.
                                    Good chat.
                                Plenty of relaxing puzzle games allow you to jump and explore, though. I find exploration and freedom in a game relaxing in itself.

But weird to imply that jumping would some how not make sense because of the game genre. Besides, you can jump up on to most things in the game.
Voice actor lol.

Its a cat they recorded.
I like her better than the Bayonetta lady
This made my whole night. Truly.
please tell her I love her
Now this, this is news.

theres a time traveller from greece under the name of laica--->who has time pupils and is currently about to take the rule over humanity...  
if any timetraveller loses a limb they will get one more limb and the lost limb has the senses just like any human being ...he time travellers will be given a world   
to rule and to safeguard I am saying this as I am chosen for the time travel...they have all the rights like aliens who abducted humans out of usa...shes is based out of chicago who portrays   
the outset just as like any of human beings...when I asked her update about corona she told its a biowar not for the faint hearted
I mean no insult, but I hope he was prodded to make specific vocalizations.
Ok, but can we appreciate them using an actual cay?

So many dev teams and shit will have a voice actor meow, because I guess real cats don't cut it.

Good kitty
I knew the cat actor had to be an Orange Tabby. They are chatty AF! lol
    ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a gray tabby üòÖ
She had my two cats freaked out on launch day lol. What a good kitty! \^.\^
So i guess you could say that the stray world is Lalaland......
Good girl!
Which character does she voice? /s
Well well well. Looks like someone is almost entirely grey.
Ok, but did they use this guy for the russian localization: https://youtu.be/OiENxjE_xEU
I know you‚Äôre joking, but the fall scene stills hurts my heart üò≠
    Bro I feel u, I meowed up at the other cats and I made myself almost cry bc I was so sad üò≠üò≠
        Bruh i know it was like right at the beginning but i had to pause and go shove my face into my cats belly cause it hurt me so bad
            No, same, I almost just uninstalled
                I fucking haven‚Äôt played it past that part!
                    lmao
            Haha I cried like a baby then gave each of my cats kisses like a psycho.
    Oh gosh and then after the fall scene when the kitty gets up but it‚Äôs limping.. I had to stop and hug my kitties for a bit.
        Same. The game just looked like a futuristic cat simulator from the clips I had seen prior to purchase, I was not expecting it to get so intense.
        THIS DAMN GAME AND THE ATTACK ON CAT OWNERS EMOTIONS IT DOES
    The fall scene broke my heart and I cried üò≠üò≠üò≠
    Can we talk about when the roof opens up ü•≤
    There are several moments in the game that will hurt your heart. I was just expecting a light hearted little cat game, but it's actually a pretty touching story that stayed with me a long time after it was over.
        I played it again as soon as finished it. Seeing this post makes me want to play it again. I LOVED the world the developers built.
    Wait... but how did they get that audio? Oh no...
        She's a very talented actress
            Catress*
        I feel like if you just attached a mic to a talkative cat and waited 24 hours that would be adequate
    Okay, I had to stop and I haven‚Äôt gone back‚Ä¶because I couldn‚Äôt stop crying since my cat was on my lap when I was playing‚Ä¶does it get worse or better?! üò≠üò≠
        You serious ? It‚Äôs a great game just play it.
    My daughter lost her fucking mind
    I just watched that for the first time on a YouTube LP and I just started sobbing and had to go and find my own little ginger kitten and hug him, had a full on breakdown on my stairs about anything happening to him - I'm unbothered when people get hurt in video games but my god, I'm actually traumatised over watching a cat fall
    I think all the videos of people's pets watching that scene and getting VERY UPSET shows how universal that sentiment is.
That moment I knew Thatcher is definitely dead.
Her Performance was Meowtastic!

    may i raise this then? (shameless plug in) r/catswatchingstray
Which is more than most people on /r/antiwork can say.
Shame they couldn't get Chris Pratt
    What about Chris Catt?
        He's so cool
            Is that a line he says?
                When Nintendo unveiled him as the voice of Mario in the Mario movie that's literally all they said about him... "Starring as Mario, it's Chris Pratt, he's so cool."
                    Chris Catt and Chris Pratt are completely different actors. Nintendo got confused.

They casted the wrong actor.
                        Also once they caught their mistake they forgot to remove that line where Mario goes "meow".
                            *movie writers sweating as they re-write the entire script to change Mario from a cat to Chris Pratt*
                    Dunkey really liked that one lol
                    But is he cool , i always thought he was an okay kind of guy
                        Depends on a few factors, that.
                    I thought Danny DeVito was the obvious choice (also a national treasure), but ya can‚Äôt win em all can you
        Nah we got crisp rat
            Chinese restaurant style.
                KFC Style *Extra Cwispy*

        Catt Prhris?
        He a pussy
        You win today, tomorrow, will be another day!
    I don't think he would nail the accent.
        They can just say that the cat is doing its best Chris Pratt impression.
        He wouldn't need it, he'd just use his regular voice!
    Why would you want a crisp rat playing a cat?
    They got Priss Cat, arguably better.
    Christopher Prattle is such a good va

            Why
                evidently, "I l6lilii"
    I.... Don't get it
        I think it maybe a reference to getting Chris Hemsworth, an Austrailian, to play Thor, a norse god from Scandinavia. Aka, getting people far removed from a culture to play someone in it. Or its in relation to Rebel Williams. Idk, I could be wrong, it could be a meme thing I'm not aware of.
        Maybe a reference to Tropic Thunder, with Robert Downey Jr playing as Kirk Lazurus, an Australian method actor casted to play an African American black man.

But then again Aussies playing characters of other countries is fairly typical.
    This is the same as faking it because Australia doesn't actually exist
        Shhh! We‚Äôre not supposed to tell anyone that!
        Its just a bunch of spiders those cunts made it all up
            If you ever meet someone who claims to be Australian, it's actually 10,000 spiders in a human suit.
                I mean with the wack ass shit they have that doesnt sound that far fetched
    Is this not a Wilfred reference?

Who owns the cat? I came to the comments to get the back story but everyone is just talking about the game or cat memes. Is this one of the dev's cats or did they hire some company? How does one find a cat for voice acting? OP don't leave us hanging, what's the deal with Lala? I hate it when users post something interesting then don't explain anything in the comments
    I know nothing about this cat in particular, but she was probably trained for film/TV (like the character Goose in Captain Marvel, a cat in a cat food commercial, or the monkey in Pirates of the Caribbean). To take another guess, the cat may be naturally chatty, and so the trainer worked to develop her into performing different types of vocalizations on cue (a cute meow, hissing, yowling, etc). After the casting director got over their initial "I have to cast what now?!" they probably started asking around in the niche animal actor community and someone was like "Oh, I have the perfect cat!". Other considerations that the casting director probably had to account for (besides a cat who sounded appropriately cat-like) would be the range of vocalizations the cat can perform, their willingness to perform in an unfamiliar sound studio (I heard they were worried Goose wouldn't like the actors in their alien costumes since they were totally unfamiliar), their willingness to perform directly in front of a microphone, and their willingness to perform over and over again (I think Jack the monkey could be difficult to work with at times because he got bored of doing the same thing).
        >I know nothing about this cat in particular

let me stop you right there.
            I mean, the person they responded to *did* ask just ‚Äúhow does one find a cat for voice acting?‚Äù In addition to asking about this particular cat, but still just in general.
            I mean I don't know anything about the world of animal acting but they seem like a huge nerd about it lol. They're just offering an inference based on their existing knowledge for anyone who doesn't feel like googling it

I found it informative
                sorry i just found the preface funny.
    Don't worry, all your questions have answers. They won't be here tho, because that's just OP's random cat.

Comment of the year right here, folks.
My favorite was scratching stuff and tripping people. I really related to my cats when I was doing those things.
    Running that one chess game
    My four year old plays and will spend 30 mins just tripping robots. Then he‚Äôll spend another 30 knocking over every single paint can and flower pot he can find. Truly gets the cat experience
This game depressed me for some reason. Maybe cause I have 4 cats and can‚Äôt imagine losing any of them or they being separated.

Only game that has had that affect on me.

            Fun fact:
I haven‚Äôt played any of the Watch Dog games but supposedly there are no dogs in Legion because the simulation that accounts for the relationships between all the NPCs in the game would have to account for dogs or any effect on dogs when something happened to their owner and they just didn‚Äôt want to deal with that.
        In fable 2, I sacrificed the world to save my dog, no hesitation.
        Me getting excited playing Kenshi when one of my guys arms gets cut off and my dog picks it up off the ground and runs around with it for a while before eating it.
        Omg we get it, John Wick. Go home already. üòí
    I rushed through that game because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep soundly until I saw the kitty get home safe to his kitty friends üòøüß°
        Good news! Some people traced the cat's steps and figured out where you exit the city is actually right around the corner from where you entered. The cat should be close enough to reunite with his family.
        You‚Ä¶saw that happen?

Did we play the same game?
            Super secret ending that only one person has ever gotten.
            wasn't there a meow right offscreen?
                Not that I noticed, but if a single meow is heard offscreen, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a clear indication the cat is reunited with a bunch of other cats. A chorus of meows? Sure.
        I‚Ä¶ have bad news for you
        Sounds like you never even played to the end or didn‚Äôt play it at all
            I did and I was disappointed; I just didn‚Äôt want to spoil it here for other folks
        Damn you must not be sleeping very good still. I‚Äôm sorry a virtual cat messed you so up.
    You‚Äôre right it‚Äôs so depressing. Gotta go back to mass genocide in CoD to cheer myself up.
    That definitely saddened me too. If you want to fuck up yourself some more I recommend The Last Guardian.
I got that same achievement in like 40 minutes lol, because I thought it was cool at the part where the cables shake when you meow. After that not much though.
I was the same! I would meow constantly, a lot of times just sitting there meowing. I thought it was so cute. What a magnificent game.
My husband watched me play (he's the better gamer by far but he said it was more fun to watch me enjoy it) and he was not surprised at all when I got that achievement within the first 5 minutes of gameplay. The meow button was one of my favorite parts of that game lol
The second I figured out I could press button to meow I was mashing that mf
Same. Meowed almost constantly. 

And then I got to the stealth section

And forgot that meowing is in fact not very stealthy

^(meow)
I did it just like you. I was meowing, all. The. Time. Meow meow meow as I did everything. Loved that game.
I got the achievement in my first play through. I don‚Äôt remember how long it took me.
    I got it in the city I just kept meowing while exploring the place also I would meow a bunch after dialogues
I got "sleep for an hour" achievement almost first thing. I had left the game open on accident before I went to bed,  and I decided to sleep in-game before I saved. I think it was the 4th achievement I got, the one before was meowing 100 times. I got all of the being-a-cat related achievements before getting to the big tree city thing which was scratching things and jumping 500 times.
Same, haven't finished it but I've been meowing at everything. Once I saw it light up a string of lights I was like... What other secrets does meowing hold?!
Seriously... I spent a lot of time just doing stuff... finding all the spots to chill at and let the cat nap.. it was a chill experience. Also the paint.. and making paw prints.
My brother was way too happy with the fact that you could meow during cutscenes. I don't think there was a cutscene that he wasn't meowing through.
Tbf, I understand the director wanting to deal with an actor who has more than one brain cell.
    I agree, every orange cat I've ever met hasn't exactly been the sharpest.
        I had an orange cat who was really smart.  Came when called, had whole conversations with me, etc.  She ended up dying young of a seizure, so apparently there's a biological hard limit for orange cat computation.
            I've known three, one lost the ability to turn while sprinting causing him to crash into things while all amped up, one likes to sleep in the street for some reason, and the other tried starting a fight club with a bunch of raccoons.
                > the other tried starting a fight club with a bunch of raccoons

I can entirely believe raccoons participating in a fight club.
                    Is that not the plot lot of Guardians 3?
                    Yeah, being like ‚ÄúMarmalade isn‚Äôt the sharpest raccoon we‚Äôve ever met, but we let him join us because we value inclusivity.‚Äù
                        "Boss, why do we call him 'Marmalade'?"

"Damn it Jimmy he's fuckin' Orange! What the hell else we're we gonna call him? Tang!? Think before you open that trash heap you call a mug!"

Also for some reason as I typed this it sounded in my head that all raccoons talk like they're from Brooklyn...all of them.
                > one likes to sleep in the street for some reason

Literally what happened to my orange cat.  One day he didn't wake up in time.
            I grew up with an orange farm rescue. He had street smarts, knew how to get my bf‚Äôs attention before leading him to doors or the catnip stash. Caught rodents like a boss ( back before people were informed on the perils of outdoor cats), and had such a suave personality.
            So that's why the rest of the orange 'species' only has one brain cell to share.  Your cat took the rest to the grave :(
                Despite being the most intelligent orange cat, he behaves exactly as they all do. It‚Äôs poetic, actually.
            *Those who burn twice as bright, burn half as long.*
                Yeah.  She had the most cat I'd ever seen in a single cat.
            Aw, poor kitty. I'm sorry :-(
    All cats share one 5th dimensional brain cell that pops into and out of existence based on observation.

That's string theory... and what do cats love most...

    You‚Äôre absolutely right. I love my little orange but she is in outer space all the time. Also idk if it‚Äôs all oranges or just mine but she doesn‚Äôt make normal cat noises üòÇ her meow is like a little tea kettle.
        Girl oranges are special. I mean, they're kinda rare, anyway, but they also tend to be *special* üòù
    My least talkative cat so far has been an orange tabby. Even when he does meow, which is infrequent, it's very quiet. My most talkative cat was a Russian blue and I dearly miss him. Interestingly enough, when he died recently, my next oldest male cat, a tuxedo, started meowing a lot more. I think he's taken the place of leader and representative of my cat pack. He's the one who tells me when a bowl needs filling and meows at me when I come home like his big bro used to do even though he didn't really do it before. It's been interesting to watch the shift in the hierarchy.
    Wow, man. Racist much?

Stray 2 is going to be one of those games that takes what the first does and transcends an entire genre and defines what games are allowed to be going forward. The amount of care and love I saw in that first game convinced me that the sequel is going to be amazing. It reminds me of Portal in that way. Get a better story with better puzzles and more interesting use of mechanics and you've got a recipe for GoTY
    I wish lol. I don't think a game as short as Stray would have a chance for GOTY though. They'd need to make the second game way longer, at least double its predecessor.

Well, the voice acting was on point.
Why? It was beautiful, had incredible story telling and did something entirely unique.
    I agree! But not one thirds as good as Elden Ring/Ragnarok for it to be nominated aside them as if they're in the same range
        I liked it more than Elden Ring and haven't been able to play Ragnarok. 

Elden Ring was fun, but it was just open world Dark Souls with the same regurgitated plot as DS 1, 2 and 3.
            You can like a game more than other games and still acknowledge the game you liked less was better. People have different tastes, which is why for some people a niche 9/10 game is way more enjoyable than a broad 10/10 game. Stray is exactly that, a niche 9/10 game. Did I enjoy it more than a 10/10 game? Maybe. Doesn't mean the game is better, means I enjoyed it more.

To give you an analogy, lets say we have American football and then basketball. You don't like basketball and enjoy football more, but you can acknowledge that basketball is still a better sport to most people, therefore making it better.
                I agree with your point but I think Stray was a better game than Elden Ring. Elden Ring isn't anything new or creative. It's a fun game, but it wasn't groundbreaking whereas Stray was. 

Also, American Football is a significantly better sport than Basketball which encourages fouling in the last two minutes.
                    How is stray even considered a game and in what world was that sack of mediocrity ‚Äúgroundbreaking‚Äù
                    Did you really just call a game where you hold forward, and press X to win "groundbreaking"? Fuck me.
                    Elden Ring wasn't groundbreaking? Lol, yes it was. It broke the internet. If Elden Ring isn't groundbreaking then Stray is an average game.

As for American Football, I agree its better to watch but basketball is infinitely more fun to play.
Welcome to the Internet, where cats mean everything and the points don't matter
Can you not jump seriously!?  This may be a deal breaker for me.  Was thinking of grabbing it on sale at some point.
    Only at interact points where a prompt appears.
        That's really disappointing for a game you play as a cat.  Thanks for the info!
            There are many prompts for places to jump in stray. There are some areas that are blocked with those pigeon spike type things, and obviously you can't jump from a height that will be fatal or leave the cat injured. Some areas have fewer jump spots, for challenge... It's no where near as bad as this person makes it out to be.
            you can jump on pretty much anything that would make sense to jump on or that you would need to. it's a really good game don't listen to the other guy definitely pick it up on sale
                Yeah but I just envisioned jumping around willy nilly as I explored.  I probably still will, just seems like it will be less, immersive?
                    there's so much vertical environment in Stray that having free jump would make navigating the world way more difficult. seriously while playing if you look to any spot 9/10 times you can jump there. you just can't stand out in the flat open and jump up and down for no reason. watch some gameplay. the game is very immersive with a beautiful environment and you can very much explore around as you please.
                        More difficult, but a lot more fun.
                        I mean I guess cats don't often go around just randomly jumping.  It is typically more of a get in place and prepared type thing.  Still though, I just have a general disappointment in games that don't allow free jumping.
                            You should absolutely get the game. It's amazing. You can indeed jump on a bunch of stuff, and will spend a good part of the game doing so. You'll be climbing terrain, jumping from building to building and exploring like crazy.
                                Yes, and that is ALL you do in the game. It wears out about 3 hours in.
            As a cat lover it bums me out. the beauty is in the details, and that detail seems to have been overlooked. Game on homie
                I own cats and they don't usually just randomly jump unless they've been frightened.

In stray the cat can jump onto anything that makes sense for a cat to jump onto.
                    So they only jump up in predetermined spots where the blue skittles pops up?
                        Its a relaxing adventure/puzzle game not a domestic feline simulator....
                            I'm aware what it is. I'm also aware of what it's not. It's not for me.
                                Good chat.
                            Plenty of relaxing puzzle games allow you to jump and explore, though. I find exploration and freedom in a game relaxing in itself.

But weird to imply that jumping would some how not make sense because of the game genre. Besides, you can jump up on to most things in the game.
‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a gray tabby üòÖ
Bro I feel u, I meowed up at the other cats and I made myself almost cry bc I was so sad üò≠üò≠
    Bruh i know it was like right at the beginning but i had to pause and go shove my face into my cats belly cause it hurt me so bad
        No, same, I almost just uninstalled
            I fucking haven‚Äôt played it past that part!
                lmao
        Haha I cried like a baby then gave each of my cats kisses like a psycho.
Oh gosh and then after the fall scene when the kitty gets up but it‚Äôs limping.. I had to stop and hug my kitties for a bit.
    Same. The game just looked like a futuristic cat simulator from the clips I had seen prior to purchase, I was not expecting it to get so intense.
    THIS DAMN GAME AND THE ATTACK ON CAT OWNERS EMOTIONS IT DOES
The fall scene broke my heart and I cried üò≠üò≠üò≠
Can we talk about when the roof opens up ü•≤
There are several moments in the game that will hurt your heart. I was just expecting a light hearted little cat game, but it's actually a pretty touching story that stayed with me a long time after it was over.
    I played it again as soon as finished it. Seeing this post makes me want to play it again. I LOVED the world the developers built.
Wait... but how did they get that audio? Oh no...
    She's a very talented actress

    I feel like if you just attached a mic to a talkative cat and waited 24 hours that would be adequate
Okay, I had to stop and I haven‚Äôt gone back‚Ä¶because I couldn‚Äôt stop crying since my cat was on my lap when I was playing‚Ä¶does it get worse or better?! üò≠üò≠
    You serious ? It‚Äôs a great game just play it.
My daughter lost her fucking mind
I just watched that for the first time on a YouTube LP and I just started sobbing and had to go and find my own little ginger kitten and hug him, had a full on breakdown on my stairs about anything happening to him - I'm unbothered when people get hurt in video games but my god, I'm actually traumatised over watching a cat fall
I think all the videos of people's pets watching that scene and getting VERY UPSET shows how universal that sentiment is.
Are you telling me Cat police officers and kitten businessmen aren't a thing?

What about Chris Catt?
    He's so cool
        Is that a line he says?
            When Nintendo unveiled him as the voice of Mario in the Mario movie that's literally all they said about him... "Starring as Mario, it's Chris Pratt, he's so cool."
                Chris Catt and Chris Pratt are completely different actors. Nintendo got confused.

They casted the wrong actor.
                    Also once they caught their mistake they forgot to remove that line where Mario goes "meow".
                        *movie writers sweating as they re-write the entire script to change Mario from a cat to Chris Pratt*
                Dunkey really liked that one lol

        Why
            evidently, "I l6lilii"
I.... Don't get it
    I think it maybe a reference to getting Chris Hemsworth, an Austrailian, to play Thor, a norse god from Scandinavia. Aka, getting people far removed from a culture to play someone in it. Or its in relation to Rebel Williams. Idk, I could be wrong, it could be a meme thing I'm not aware of.
    Maybe a reference to Tropic Thunder, with Robert Downey Jr playing as Kirk Lazurus, an Australian method actor casted to play an African American black man.

But then again Aussies playing characters of other countries is fairly typical.
This is the same as faking it because Australia doesn't actually exist
    Shhh! We‚Äôre not supposed to tell anyone that!
    Its just a bunch of spiders those cunts made it all up
        If you ever meet someone who claims to be Australian, it's actually 10,000 spiders in a human suit.
            I mean with the wack ass shit they have that doesnt sound that far fetched
Is this not a Wilfred reference?

Too close to the actual game.

Method catcting!
Standing ovation
I know nothing about this cat in particular, but she was probably trained for film/TV (like the character Goose in Captain Marvel, a cat in a cat food commercial, or the monkey in Pirates of the Caribbean). To take another guess, the cat may be naturally chatty, and so the trainer worked to develop her into performing different types of vocalizations on cue (a cute meow, hissing, yowling, etc). After the casting director got over their initial "I have to cast what now?!" they probably started asking around in the niche animal actor community and someone was like "Oh, I have the perfect cat!". Other considerations that the casting director probably had to account for (besides a cat who sounded appropriately cat-like) would be the range of vocalizations the cat can perform, their willingness to perform in an unfamiliar sound studio (I heard they were worried Goose wouldn't like the actors in their alien costumes since they were totally unfamiliar), their willingness to perform directly in front of a microphone, and their willingness to perform over and over again (I think Jack the monkey could be difficult to work with at times because he got bored of doing the same thing).
    >I know nothing about this cat in particular

let me stop you right there.
        I mean, the person they responded to *did* ask just ‚Äúhow does one find a cat for voice acting?‚Äù In addition to asking about this particular cat, but still just in general.
        I mean I don't know anything about the world of animal acting but they seem like a huge nerd about it lol. They're just offering an inference based on their existing knowledge for anyone who doesn't feel like googling it

I found it informative

        Fun fact:
I haven‚Äôt played any of the Watch Dog games but supposedly there are no dogs in Legion because the simulation that accounts for the relationships between all the NPCs in the game would have to account for dogs or any effect on dogs when something happened to their owner and they just didn‚Äôt want to deal with that.
    In fable 2, I sacrificed the world to save my dog, no hesitation.

    Good news! Some people traced the cat's steps and figured out where you exit the city is actually right around the corner from where you entered. The cat should be close enough to reunite with his family.

        Super secret ending that only one person has ever gotten.

            Not that I noticed, but if a single meow is heard offscreen, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a clear indication the cat is reunited with a bunch of other cats. A chorus of meows? Sure.
    I‚Ä¶ have bad news for you
    Sounds like you never even played to the end or didn‚Äôt play it at all

You‚Äôre right it‚Äôs so depressing. Gotta go back to mass genocide in CoD to cheer myself up.
That definitely saddened me too. If you want to fuck up yourself some more I recommend The Last Guardian.
I got it in the city I just kept meowing while exploring the place also I would meow a bunch after dialogues
I agree, every orange cat I've ever met hasn't exactly been the sharpest.
    I had an orange cat who was really smart.  Came when called, had whole conversations with me, etc.  She ended up dying young of a seizure, so apparently there's a biological hard limit for orange cat computation.
        I've known three, one lost the ability to turn while sprinting causing him to crash into things while all amped up, one likes to sleep in the street for some reason, and the other tried starting a fight club with a bunch of raccoons.
            > the other tried starting a fight club with a bunch of raccoons

I can entirely believe raccoons participating in a fight club.
                Is that not the plot lot of Guardians 3?
                Yeah, being like ‚ÄúMarmalade isn‚Äôt the sharpest raccoon we‚Äôve ever met, but we let him join us because we value inclusivity.‚Äù
                    "Boss, why do we call him 'Marmalade'?"

"Damn it Jimmy he's fuckin' Orange! What the hell else we're we gonna call him? Tang!? Think before you open that trash heap you call a mug!"

Also for some reason as I typed this it sounded in my head that all raccoons talk like they're from Brooklyn...all of them.
            > one likes to sleep in the street for some reason

Literally what happened to my orange cat.  One day he didn't wake up in time.
        I grew up with an orange farm rescue. He had street smarts, knew how to get my bf‚Äôs attention before leading him to doors or the catnip stash. Caught rodents like a boss ( back before people were informed on the perils of outdoor cats), and had such a suave personality.
        So that's why the rest of the orange 'species' only has one brain cell to share.  Your cat took the rest to the grave :(
            Despite being the most intelligent orange cat, he behaves exactly as they all do. It‚Äôs poetic, actually.
        *Those who burn twice as bright, burn half as long.*
            Yeah.  She had the most cat I'd ever seen in a single cat.
        Aw, poor kitty. I'm sorry :-(
All cats share one 5th dimensional brain cell that pops into and out of existence based on observation.

That's string theory... and what do cats love most...

You‚Äôre absolutely right. I love my little orange but she is in outer space all the time. Also idk if it‚Äôs all oranges or just mine but she doesn‚Äôt make normal cat noises üòÇ her meow is like a little tea kettle.
    Girl oranges are special. I mean, they're kinda rare, anyway, but they also tend to be *special* üòù
My least talkative cat so far has been an orange tabby. Even when he does meow, which is infrequent, it's very quiet. My most talkative cat was a Russian blue and I dearly miss him. Interestingly enough, when he died recently, my next oldest male cat, a tuxedo, started meowing a lot more. I think he's taken the place of leader and representative of my cat pack. He's the one who tells me when a bowl needs filling and meows at me when I come home like his big bro used to do even though he didn't really do it before. It's been interesting to watch the shift in the hierarchy.
Wow, man. Racist much?

I agree! But not one thirds as good as Elden Ring/Ragnarok for it to be nominated aside them as if they're in the same range
    I liked it more than Elden Ring and haven't been able to play Ragnarok. 

Elden Ring was fun, but it was just open world Dark Souls with the same regurgitated plot as DS 1, 2 and 3.
        You can like a game more than other games and still acknowledge the game you liked less was better. People have different tastes, which is why for some people a niche 9/10 game is way more enjoyable than a broad 10/10 game. Stray is exactly that, a niche 9/10 game. Did I enjoy it more than a 10/10 game? Maybe. Doesn't mean the game is better, means I enjoyed it more.

To give you an analogy, lets say we have American football and then basketball. You don't like basketball and enjoy football more, but you can acknowledge that basketball is still a better sport to most people, therefore making it better.
            I agree with your point but I think Stray was a better game than Elden Ring. Elden Ring isn't anything new or creative. It's a fun game, but it wasn't groundbreaking whereas Stray was. 

Also, American Football is a significantly better sport than Basketball which encourages fouling in the last two minutes.
                How is stray even considered a game and in what world was that sack of mediocrity ‚Äúgroundbreaking‚Äù
                Did you really just call a game where you hold forward, and press X to win "groundbreaking"? Fuck me.
                Elden Ring wasn't groundbreaking? Lol, yes it was. It broke the internet. If Elden Ring isn't groundbreaking then Stray is an average game.

As for American Football, I agree its better to watch but basketball is infinitely more fun to play.
Only at interact points where a prompt appears.
    That's really disappointing for a game you play as a cat.  Thanks for the info!
        There are many prompts for places to jump in stray. There are some areas that are blocked with those pigeon spike type things, and obviously you can't jump from a height that will be fatal or leave the cat injured. Some areas have fewer jump spots, for challenge... It's no where near as bad as this person makes it out to be.
        you can jump on pretty much anything that would make sense to jump on or that you would need to. it's a really good game don't listen to the other guy definitely pick it up on sale
            Yeah but I just envisioned jumping around willy nilly as I explored.  I probably still will, just seems like it will be less, immersive?
                there's so much vertical environment in Stray that having free jump would make navigating the world way more difficult. seriously while playing if you look to any spot 9/10 times you can jump there. you just can't stand out in the flat open and jump up and down for no reason. watch some gameplay. the game is very immersive with a beautiful environment and you can very much explore around as you please.
                    More difficult, but a lot more fun.
                    I mean I guess cats don't often go around just randomly jumping.  It is typically more of a get in place and prepared type thing.  Still though, I just have a general disappointment in games that don't allow free jumping.
                        You should absolutely get the game. It's amazing. You can indeed jump on a bunch of stuff, and will spend a good part of the game doing so. You'll be climbing terrain, jumping from building to building and exploring like crazy.
                            Yes, and that is ALL you do in the game. It wears out about 3 hours in.
        As a cat lover it bums me out. the beauty is in the details, and that detail seems to have been overlooked. Game on homie
            I own cats and they don't usually just randomly jump unless they've been frightened.

In stray the cat can jump onto anything that makes sense for a cat to jump onto.
                So they only jump up in predetermined spots where the blue skittles pops up?
                    Its a relaxing adventure/puzzle game not a domestic feline simulator....
                        I'm aware what it is. I'm also aware of what it's not. It's not for me.
                            Good chat.
                        Plenty of relaxing puzzle games allow you to jump and explore, though. I find exploration and freedom in a game relaxing in itself.

But weird to imply that jumping would some how not make sense because of the game genre. Besides, you can jump up on to most things in the game.
Bruh i know it was like right at the beginning but i had to pause and go shove my face into my cats belly cause it hurt me so bad
    No, same, I almost just uninstalled
        I fucking haven‚Äôt played it past that part!
            lmao
    Haha I cried like a baby then gave each of my cats kisses like a psycho.
Same. The game just looked like a futuristic cat simulator from the clips I had seen prior to purchase, I was not expecting it to get so intense.
THIS DAMN GAME AND THE ATTACK ON CAT OWNERS EMOTIONS IT DOES
I played it again as soon as finished it. Seeing this post makes me want to play it again. I LOVED the world the developers built.
She's a very talented actress

I feel like if you just attached a mic to a talkative cat and waited 24 hours that would be adequate
You serious ? It‚Äôs a great game just play it.
Best we could do is Crisp rat.
He's so cool
    Is that a line he says?
        When Nintendo unveiled him as the voice of Mario in the Mario movie that's literally all they said about him... "Starring as Mario, it's Chris Pratt, he's so cool."
            Chris Catt and Chris Pratt are completely different actors. Nintendo got confused.

They casted the wrong actor.
                Also once they caught their mistake they forgot to remove that line where Mario goes "meow".
                    *movie writers sweating as they re-write the entire script to change Mario from a cat to Chris Pratt*
            Dunkey really liked that one lol
            But is he cool , i always thought he was an okay kind of guy
                Depends on a few factors, that.
            I thought Danny DeVito was the obvious choice (also a national treasure), but ya can‚Äôt win em all can you
Nah we got crisp rat

Or Cat Williams for edgy humor.
Hiss Catt?

You win today, tomorrow, will be another day!
They can just say that the cat is doing its best Chris Pratt impression.
He wouldn't need it, he'd just use his regular voice!

RIP Smee, OG 1P, the only dude to put a leash on Jet Li
That would actually fit Chris Pratt
The cat didn't break her heart so she can't play it
Hah!  Nice.
    The people behind Monster Hunter could really learn a thing or two from Lala.
        How are they ever gonna find a real fatalis to voice act in their game? Thing‚Äôs extinct.
            Just go all jurassic Park on them and revive them via DNA, obviously. It's not like that ever had anything bad happen
            I meant more the "palicos", but allthe same - dire VO landscape fo sho.

[removed]
    Why
        evidently, "I l6lilii"
I think it maybe a reference to getting Chris Hemsworth, an Austrailian, to play Thor, a norse god from Scandinavia. Aka, getting people far removed from a culture to play someone in it. Or its in relation to Rebel Williams. Idk, I could be wrong, it could be a meme thing I'm not aware of.
Maybe a reference to Tropic Thunder, with Robert Downey Jr playing as Kirk Lazurus, an Australian method actor casted to play an African American black man.

But then again Aussies playing characters of other countries is fairly typical.
Shhh! We‚Äôre not supposed to tell anyone that!
Its just a bunch of spiders those cunts made it all up
    If you ever meet someone who claims to be Australian, it's actually 10,000 spiders in a human suit.
        I mean with the wack ass shit they have that doesnt sound that far fetched

            In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
It wasn't 4 years ago.  It just seems that long.  The movie came out at the very end of 2019.
And that's Dame Judy Dench's kitty butthole.

>He thinks that he's entitled to absolutely everything.

So, your average cat. Check.
    For that matter, your average child.
        Shit I have an old cat who never misses a chance to give me a long winded lecture about how he doesn't approve of the way I do things around here.
    To some extent, sure, but we've had more than half a dozen cats since we got married, and, well, he goes waaaaay beyond.
"He thinks that he's entitled to *absolutely everything*."

Sooo... a cat?
    We have had a lot of cats, and, well, yeah, but he goes *above and beyond*.
You can't just go and tell us about your primadonna retired show cat and not even provide us with cat tax!  I'm sure your cat would be really disappointed with you if he found out you weren't sharing his beautiful face with the world ...
I'd say it's not considering how many upvotes it got.
    Redditors be like "Why doesn't this comment from literally five minutes ago have more upvotes???"
Even his shadow!!!
There's a reason she embodied that character so well.
>I know nothing about this cat in particular

let me stop you right there.
    I mean, the person they responded to *did* ask just ‚Äúhow does one find a cat for voice acting?‚Äù In addition to asking about this particular cat, but still just in general.
    I mean I don't know anything about the world of animal acting but they seem like a huge nerd about it lol. They're just offering an inference based on their existing knowledge for anyone who doesn't feel like googling it

    Fun fact:
I haven‚Äôt played any of the Watch Dog games but supposedly there are no dogs in Legion because the simulation that accounts for the relationships between all the NPCs in the game would have to account for dogs or any effect on dogs when something happened to their owner and they just didn‚Äôt want to deal with that.
In fable 2, I sacrificed the world to save my dog, no hesitation.

Good news! Some people traced the cat's steps and figured out where you exit the city is actually right around the corner from where you entered. The cat should be close enough to reunite with his family.
You‚Ä¶saw that happen?

Did we play the same game?
    Super secret ending that only one person has ever gotten.
    wasn't there a meow right offscreen?
        Not that I noticed, but if a single meow is heard offscreen, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a clear indication the cat is reunited with a bunch of other cats. A chorus of meows? Sure.
I‚Ä¶ have bad news for you
Sounds like you never even played to the end or didn‚Äôt play it at all
    I did and I was disappointed; I just didn‚Äôt want to spoil it here for other folks
Damn you must not be sleeping very good still. I‚Äôm sorry a virtual cat messed you so up.
I had an orange cat who was really smart.  Came when called, had whole conversations with me, etc.  She ended up dying young of a seizure, so apparently there's a biological hard limit for orange cat computation.
    I've known three, one lost the ability to turn while sprinting causing him to crash into things while all amped up, one likes to sleep in the street for some reason, and the other tried starting a fight club with a bunch of raccoons.
        > the other tried starting a fight club with a bunch of raccoons

I can entirely believe raccoons participating in a fight club.
            Is that not the plot lot of Guardians 3?
            Yeah, being like ‚ÄúMarmalade isn‚Äôt the sharpest raccoon we‚Äôve ever met, but we let him join us because we value inclusivity.‚Äù
                "Boss, why do we call him 'Marmalade'?"

"Damn it Jimmy he's fuckin' Orange! What the hell else we're we gonna call him? Tang!? Think before you open that trash heap you call a mug!"

Also for some reason as I typed this it sounded in my head that all raccoons talk like they're from Brooklyn...all of them.
        > one likes to sleep in the street for some reason

Literally what happened to my orange cat.  One day he didn't wake up in time.
    I grew up with an orange farm rescue. He had street smarts, knew how to get my bf‚Äôs attention before leading him to doors or the catnip stash. Caught rodents like a boss ( back before people were informed on the perils of outdoor cats), and had such a suave personality.
    So that's why the rest of the orange 'species' only has one brain cell to share.  Your cat took the rest to the grave :(
        Despite being the most intelligent orange cat, he behaves exactly as they all do. It‚Äôs poetic, actually.
    *Those who burn twice as bright, burn half as long.*
        Yeah.  She had the most cat I'd ever seen in a single cat.
    Aw, poor kitty. I'm sorry :-(

Whoosh

wasn't there a meow right offscreen?
    Not that I noticed, but if a single meow is heard offscreen, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a clear indication the cat is reunited with a bunch of other cats. A chorus of meows? Sure.
I did and I was disappointed; I just didn‚Äôt want to spoil it here for other folks
I've known three, one lost the ability to turn while sprinting causing him to crash into things while all amped up, one likes to sleep in the street for some reason, and the other tried starting a fight club with a bunch of raccoons.
    > the other tried starting a fight club with a bunch of raccoons

I can entirely believe raccoons participating in a fight club.
        Is that not the plot lot of Guardians 3?
        Yeah, being like ‚ÄúMarmalade isn‚Äôt the sharpest raccoon we‚Äôve ever met, but we let him join us because we value inclusivity.‚Äù
            "Boss, why do we call him 'Marmalade'?"

"Damn it Jimmy he's fuckin' Orange! What the hell else we're we gonna call him? Tang!? Think before you open that trash heap you call a mug!"

Also for some reason as I typed this it sounded in my head that all raccoons talk like they're from Brooklyn...all of them.
    > one likes to sleep in the street for some reason

Literally what happened to my orange cat.  One day he didn't wake up in time.
I grew up with an orange farm rescue. He had street smarts, knew how to get my bf‚Äôs attention before leading him to doors or the catnip stash. Caught rodents like a boss ( back before people were informed on the perils of outdoor cats), and had such a suave personality.
So that's why the rest of the orange 'species' only has one brain cell to share.  Your cat took the rest to the grave :(
    Despite being the most intelligent orange cat, he behaves exactly as they all do. It‚Äôs poetic, actually.
*Those who burn twice as bright, burn half as long.*
    Yeah.  She had the most cat I'd ever seen in a single cat.
Aw, poor kitty. I'm sorry :-(
I don't know how or when I became this person that is subbed to like 8 different cat subs but here we are with number 9
    > I don't know how or when I became this person that is subbed to like 8 different cat subs but here we are with number 9

    Ah, a young cat sub-finder on their journey. Welcome young initiate.
    Now that's a full cat life.
And you‚Äôre being downvoted for calling them out on it! The mods have turned, they support ginger cat discrimination it seems!
    Be right back I gotta go make some picket signs and stand on a street corner about this
The mods are also orange cats.
It‚Äôs crazy that a formerly buttered orange cat who can‚Äôt avoid the occasional trash can mishap is becoming the face of America‚Äôs unions. I am totally here for it.
Damn, can't believe how easily I could have worked that in too.  Well done.

You can like a game more than other games and still acknowledge the game you liked less was better. People have different tastes, which is why for some people a niche 9/10 game is way more enjoyable than a broad 10/10 game. Stray is exactly that, a niche 9/10 game. Did I enjoy it more than a 10/10 game? Maybe. Doesn't mean the game is better, means I enjoyed it more.

To give you an analogy, lets say we have American football and then basketball. You don't like basketball and enjoy football more, but you can acknowledge that basketball is still a better sport to most people, therefore making it better.
    I agree with your point but I think Stray was a better game than Elden Ring. Elden Ring isn't anything new or creative. It's a fun game, but it wasn't groundbreaking whereas Stray was. 

Also, American Football is a significantly better sport than Basketball which encourages fouling in the last two minutes.
        How is stray even considered a game and in what world was that sack of mediocrity ‚Äúgroundbreaking‚Äù
        Did you really just call a game where you hold forward, and press X to win "groundbreaking"? Fuck me.
        Elden Ring wasn't groundbreaking? Lol, yes it was. It broke the internet. If Elden Ring isn't groundbreaking then Stray is an average game.

As for American Football, I agree its better to watch but basketball is infinitely more fun to play.
There are many prompts for places to jump in stray. There are some areas that are blocked with those pigeon spike type things, and obviously you can't jump from a height that will be fatal or leave the cat injured. Some areas have fewer jump spots, for challenge... It's no where near as bad as this person makes it out to be.
you can jump on pretty much anything that would make sense to jump on or that you would need to. it's a really good game don't listen to the other guy definitely pick it up on sale
    Yeah but I just envisioned jumping around willy nilly as I explored.  I probably still will, just seems like it will be less, immersive?
        there's so much vertical environment in Stray that having free jump would make navigating the world way more difficult. seriously while playing if you look to any spot 9/10 times you can jump there. you just can't stand out in the flat open and jump up and down for no reason. watch some gameplay. the game is very immersive with a beautiful environment and you can very much explore around as you please.
            More difficult, but a lot more fun.
            I mean I guess cats don't often go around just randomly jumping.  It is typically more of a get in place and prepared type thing.  Still though, I just have a general disappointment in games that don't allow free jumping.
                You should absolutely get the game. It's amazing. You can indeed jump on a bunch of stuff, and will spend a good part of the game doing so. You'll be climbing terrain, jumping from building to building and exploring like crazy.
                    Yes, and that is ALL you do in the game. It wears out about 3 hours in.
As a cat lover it bums me out. the beauty is in the details, and that detail seems to have been overlooked. Game on homie
    I own cats and they don't usually just randomly jump unless they've been frightened.

In stray the cat can jump onto anything that makes sense for a cat to jump onto.
        So they only jump up in predetermined spots where the blue skittles pops up?
            Its a relaxing adventure/puzzle game not a domestic feline simulator....
                I'm aware what it is. I'm also aware of what it's not. It's not for me.
                    Good chat.
                Plenty of relaxing puzzle games allow you to jump and explore, though. I find exploration and freedom in a game relaxing in itself.

But weird to imply that jumping would some how not make sense because of the game genre. Besides, you can jump up on to most things in the game.
I fucking haven‚Äôt played it past that part!
    lmao
When Nintendo unveiled him as the voice of Mario in the Mario movie that's literally all they said about him... "Starring as Mario, it's Chris Pratt, he's so cool."
    Chris Catt and Chris Pratt are completely different actors. Nintendo got confused.

They casted the wrong actor.
        Also once they caught their mistake they forgot to remove that line where Mario goes "meow".
            *movie writers sweating as they re-write the entire script to change Mario from a cat to Chris Pratt*
    Dunkey really liked that one lol
    But is he cool , i always thought he was an okay kind of guy
        Depends on a few factors, that.
    I thought Danny DeVito was the obvious choice (also a national treasure), but ya can‚Äôt win em all can you
KFC Style *Extra Cwispy*
How are they ever gonna find a real fatalis to voice act in their game? Thing‚Äôs extinct.
    Just go all jurassic Park on them and revive them via DNA, obviously. It's not like that ever had anything bad happen
    I meant more the "palicos", but allthe same - dire VO landscape fo sho.
evidently, "I l6lilii"
I mean with the wack ass shit they have that doesnt sound that far fetched

theres a time traveller from greece under the name of laica--->who has time pupils and is currently about to take the rule over humanity...

the outset just as like any of human beings...when I asked her update about corona she told its a biowar not for the faint hearted
I trace it all the way back to the terrible accidents upon the USS Macon and USS Akron. Clearly, the lack of flying aircraft carriers in World War II is responsible for all of this.
    In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
Shit I have an old cat who never misses a chance to give me a long winded lecture about how he doesn't approve of the way I do things around here.
sorry i just found the preface funny.
