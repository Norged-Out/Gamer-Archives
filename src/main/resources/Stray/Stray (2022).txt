[[Stray (2022)]]





Don't let it fool you. This is an eldritch horror game.
    I love that this isn't even really a joke, it kinda is lol.
        Sweet can't wait to play then.
        Wait what
            It feels a bit like Half Life at times
                I just started, im looking forward to the crowbar, g-man and console commands
                    So now that you've had some time, what do you think of the zurks?
        For real though is there any challenge to the game at all? I don’t mind if there isn’t, it looks like it’s supposed to be a chill exploration game with some moments of running away
            There’s some little puzzles here and there but nothing difficult. You mainly just explore with a few parts where you have to run from enemies
                .. and a little bit of "combat" where you shine a light on enemies to kill them and manage the little cooldown it has.

There's also a Metal Cat Solid stealth section later on.
        Yeah after about 2 hours in and hitting the sewers I was like... Caelid? Is this Caelid? Lol
    Those sewers wigged me out so bad.
        THE GIANT EYES!!
            Me: Is this Resident Evil?
                Right?? I was NOT expecting that
            It's amazing how off guard it catches you. I remember getting low key jump scared when I noticed them.
            My take away from the gameplay is that every jump is scripted. Is this the case? Like you approach a ledge, hit a button, then there's an animation for a jump.

I was expecting a free-roaming platformer where you have a little more freedom.
                You can more or less choose the angle of the jump, and most elevated platforms can be jumped on top of.
    So that's Nyanners?
        No, it's not a worm.
I love just running along shelves and knocking everything on them flying off onto the robots.

    I love meowing at cameras
        I love meowing ~~at cameras~~
            I ~~love~~ meow~~ing at cameras~~
                ~~I love~~ meow~~ing at cameras~~
                    ***meow***
        meowing at the guys tossing paint cans long enough to distract them into dropping them
    How does it compare to Cyberpunk 2077, though?  Better, or worse, in your book?  Just curious, really
        It's not the same thing at all... Stray is more directed and of a smaller scope. Love it so far.
            They’re not the same but in terms of the overall world-building, lore, design etc. Stray has a much better and more interesting cyberpunk world.
        They are completely different types of games and it's unfair to compare them. Stray has a much, much smaller scope, there is no combat, and it has a bigger focus on puzzles. Also, Stray isn't an RPG, its a linear adventure game.
        Can't compare the two to be honest.

I'd compare Stray to like.... Shadow of the Colossus. Linear on rails sort of experience. Literally nothing to compare when against cyberpunk.

That or like The Quarry or Until Dawn and such. It's more an interactive movie than it is a "game" if that makes sense. My gf is absolutely loving it and I love to watch her enjoy that. Me myself? I'd rather play Elden Ring or Returnal.
        Well, only one game let's you shred the carpet, knock shit out the shelves, mlem and has a dedicated meow button.
    I love just being a little $&@+

I scratched up the rugs and walls 

There’s a robot that you can sleep on top of also
He's such a good boi! The game is super fun.
    Amazing game. Definitely took an unexpected tone in some parts, >!I am specifically talking about the room make of eyes and eldritch horrors.!< Not that that's bad, just... I was not ready for that in what I thought was a silly cat game.
        [deleted]
            Yes, this is a real thing

Didn't realise wholesome cat game was also >!a psychological horror!<
                Isn't the premise that you are a cat lost from the family so essentially you see the world as a lost house cat would? Cats get scared and frightened easily.
                    That's not what's going on in the game. It's a dystopia world that has eldritch monsters in it.
        Does any cat get hurt / die during this game? I kind of don't want to play it if this is the case
            Yes but it's not graphic at all and is very brief. I hate seeing cats and dogs die in video games and this games death sequences never really bothered me.
            the cat gets hurt in the beginning during the fall and the limp is realistic enough to hurt your heart, but she licks her leg after a few seconds and is ok. other than that the death sequences are brief and non graphic, the screen just kinda goes red and you go back to your last checkpoint without seeing the cat actually die. not bad at all imo
    If meditation was a game
        Idk man having the zurks chase me around gives me way more anxiety than it should
            I had to take a break because I kept dying to them and felt really depressed lol
                My gf really wants to get it but really doesn’t want to see a cat die graphically. Is it like that or a bit more gentle?
                    It's really not that bad, they stick to you and then you fall over pretty much. There's no blood or anything. I'm just a huge cat lover and it bothered me to begin with lol
                        She’s also a huge cat lover, that’s why she was concerned haha. Good to know she can get into it now!
            Shit chasing me in games always gets me.
        That's basically what Abzu is
    can't wait to get my paws on this game
        What "tier" of Playstation Plus membership is required to get this game? I'm very much interested in it, but the tier system that Playstation has released feels like a money grab.
            Otherwise its only 30 bucks. I have the premium ps plus and I'm still going to buy it. I like having my game library unlinked to an active subscription.
                And you're also supporting the studio behind a game you've enjoyed.

Bless you. I'll be doing the same.
            I think it’s the higher 2 tiers
            It's on the "extra" tier. But, it's like 40 to upgrade to it and Stray is only 30.
            None is you pay 30 euros
            I've just left mine on the basic bronze level for now. If I want a game I'll pay for it.
Honestly the  game I am looking forwrd ot the most
    Hour into it and it's fun and my cats seem to enjoy it...alittle too much, get your fluffy butts away from the screen
        Our cat tried to play with the virtual kitty.
        My take away from the gameplay is that every jump is scripted. Is this the case? Like you approach a ledge, hit a button, then there's an animation for a jump.

I was expecting a free-roaming platformer where you have a little more freedom.
            Yes, it is. The animations are beautiful, but the controls feel a bit limiting. You can meow as much as you want if that helps.
                Can I bark?
                    [removed]
                        I did find a receipt for a joke toilet
                            Has that ever happened to you?!
                                Call me right now please!
                            It's just for farts
                    I feel like most people can bark. It's not hard to do. A lot of kids do it when they are playing around.
                    It's a 20 dollar dlc.
                If they made it so you had to do the jumps yourself quite a few parts would turn into a jump king cat dlc
                hmmm, yeah. I think I'll pass. I was hoping it would be more like feline witcher3, but its more like feline tomb raider I guess.
                    It's more of a puzzle game and less of an open world game. It's entertaining. I'm a couple hours in.
                Disagree with the "beautiful" animations but otherwise a fun game
            Pro tip: After you have played for 30-45 min or so (and probably earlier if you are ok fiddling around), you can turn off the jump markers in the settings with few problems moving forward. 

This makes it feel much more organic and immersive, like you are prompting a real cat to jump who will only do so when they think it is worth it to jump & knows that they can make the jump, rather than just artificially interacting with button prompts. 

It works really well like this IMO because the jump points are (with a few exceptions) very intuitive. So much so that I wish the devs had put in a pop-up early in the game encouraging players to try it out this way.
                I don't know man, I'm almost done with it and there were a few times where I got really frustrated that I couldn't jump on thing that I should've been able to. Particularly behind the night club. Plenty of stuff I should be able to jump on get up there but only one path the game let's you take.
                    Sounds like there ought to be a hotkey that highlights jump points for a few seconds
                    I can see that for sure. I added a caveat to the last paragraph. My main point wasn’t about whether the traversal system was perfect, but about how the jump markers themselves don’t really make the game any better/easier and can probably be turned off.
                        Yeah I got you, I just feel like I needed those jump markers at a couple spots. Either way, getting confused about where I could jump was rare and didn't ruin the game. Most of the time it was intuitive. I had the day off and got it for free with ps+ and it's been really fun. I would've been totally fine paying for the game.
            Yeah. It's kind of annoying. There are dumpsters that you can't jump on right next to dumpsters that look exactly alike but you can jump on, for example.
            This is true. You also can't jump any time either. Idk why but for games that bothers me. I just want to Assassins Creed every possible surface! Lol
            It's very much not a platformer, closer to a puzzle game.

                Cat.
                    Cat.
                        [removed]
                            Cat.
                When I noticed I clicked on "publisher" and noticed I own about 50% of anything they ever published.

All of those games are very focused. Not sure if I would call that style "simple". Stray is incredibly focused. You play as a cat and they went to 100% cat movement for that. And that is the vehicle by which you explore this very interesting world.
                Neon White is also Annapurna, they aren't all walking simulators, so I disagree with the premise here.
            The story is very linear. The puzzles are as simple as they could possibly be. The majority of the gameplay feels like a point-and-click adventure in 3d. Small sections require you to run from rats, kinda like a watered down version of A Plague Tale.

I was hoping for a game where I could role play as a cat around a city, but this isn't really it.
                Keep in mind it was developed by a small studio. Considering their resources, I think its beyond my own expectations. The puzzles are pretty simple, but I kind of like it.
                Yeah same, I was imagining an open world city that you roam around in with free style movement. Meet quirky side characters or even just meet other cats that you do some stuff for. Would love to see that kind of thing
        [deleted]
            I'm about 3 hours in, it's a bit linear, but also offers exploration. In terms of difficulty/challenge, it isn't a difficult game. And the puzzles aren't 'hard'. If you're looking for a challenge in this game, I do not think it's your type of game.
                Are the puzzles easier than Untitled Goose Game?
                    I haven't played Untitled Goose Game, but the puzzles in Stray are quite straight forward. If in a small space, there are only a handful of options it could be at. In a bigger space, there are quite some "obvious" hints.
                    Yes. I played both and untitled goose game is more puzzles less story. Stray is far prettier and really sucks you into the world.
                    Yes they are
                    Yes. By a fair margin, too.
                Eh, exploration isn't really rewarded much in this game.
            It feels like I'm playing little nightmares 2 again and it's actually fun even if their isn't a ton of challenges
                I had a similar thought, mine being "I like this even more because there are some more open areas to explore around in and do some optional quest challenge things"

I love it
            Only about an hour in myself but there are puzzles to solve to get through the world.
                I'm like 4 hours in and I haven't found a puzzle that was actually interesting yet. They all have been incredibly simple and took no effort to solve, which isn't really rewarding.
                    I love the art and the gameplay itself but man this game is incredibly easy. . I really like it but I honestly think a 19.99 price point is a bit more fair
            Skillup has a good Review on it.
        That's my issue right now actually.  My car won't leave the screen alone
    I'm OOTL can someone explain why I'm seeing this everywhere
        [Because it's a game that just came out today](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/game-review-stray-redefines-the-adventure-genre-with-a-cats-eye-view/).
        It's a video game, with a cat and youre on the internet. Get ready to see it everywhere lol
            >It's a video game, with a cat

and ray tracing!

Edit: I thought I saw ray tracing in a gameplay preview...maybe I'm misremembering.
        Reddit loves cats and indie games.
        Fun linear adventure game, where you play as a regular ol cat.
            This is a pretty smart fucking cat.  Nothing regular about him.
        We've been waiting for this game for something like 6 years now from the first sneak peek. And it just came out today.
        Meow
        It's called marketing
            Not really. It's literally good looking game about cat. That was it. Thats the extent of the marketing. That was enough for everyone else to market it for them. For what it is it's great, would I pay $40 for it? Nah. But it was first day to playstations version of gamepass so wtf do I care. 

Good game. Could it be more? Sure. So can everything.
                I didn't imply it wasn't a good game or that regular people weren't sharing posts about it. Someone asked why they were seeing it everywhere and I gave them the answer.
                    I know. I just don't see this as really the effects of a terrific marketing team or anything like that. Just a byproduct of the internets love for cats.
                        Marketing 101: *Include a cat*

Profit.
                            100%. Friends have been saying how their non gamer gf wants this game. 

You can never underestimate the power of the cat. And if you do, they will pounce on you and ruin your electronics because the stupid little bastard can't stop chewing on wires and....

.... Anyways yes, the answer is cats.
        Effective viral marketing and it had a successful teaser post get popular on this subreddit a month or two ago.
            Dude it was in the original ps5 games announcement
            This game was originally shown on reddit like, 5+ years ago. One of those "I'm making my first game and here's the first clip" deals." It was pretty organic afaik. This game has been looked forward to by a lot of people for a long time.
                The first I heard of it was that big post a month or two ago. That explains things a bit!
    [deleted]
        Was watching a friend play it on twitch, i think they spent 4 hours just pushing objects off of ledges and giggling about it.
            This is why I haven't finished the game yet. I've spent a lot of time wandering and pushing stuff off ledges. Also trying to find all the collectibles and memories. I will have to go back to one chapter Cuse I went to the next area, not realizing I was
        30$ for a 4 hour game really detracts from my desire to purchase it. Guess I'll wait until it goes on sale.
        Haven't played it but watched a review and 2 things cooled my enthusiasm for it:  
1. There is no actual jump button. If you position the cat in a direction it can jump, it will say press x or whatever and the game completes the jump for you. This would take away from the fluidity of the immersion for me.  
2. The reviewer said he beat the game in 5 hours. That's like indie game short. For something that's been this hyped up I would have expected at least 8 hours of gameplay.
            > That's like indie game short.

...its an indie game
            Point 1 makes it a no buy for me. I haven't been able to get into a single game that breaks up the regular gameplay with button prompts in that way.
                You can turn the jump prompts off. It's pretty easy to tell what you can and can't jump on.
        Overhyped for a $30 game?  

That seems harsh.   Had I paid $69.99 for it, it'd be upset.   For what it is on initial play through, and going back for trophies..

7 hours on my first play through, got about 45% of the trophies blind.   Talked to damn near every character in the game.   

$30 sits just fine for me.   

It's a pretty, indie, cat game, with some weird Sci-Fi elements...

No complaints.
    Yes. Thank you. I added this to my Steam wishlist the minute I saw the gameplay video. Such an amazing concept. Very creative.

Oddly enough, Stray seemed to be an experience where I knew anything I imagined, no matter how cool, wouldn't come close to the actually finished product. I have high hopes for this one!
        Not that this game isn't good, but you might want to temper your expectations. Really just an idea for life in general...
            I have a 5 year old and an 8 year old. My little guy loves cats, but doesn't seem like a little kid game. You think he is too young?
                If you play with them (AKA  on the couch with them, on your phone while they play) it should be alright as there are some chase sequences that may be scary for a young child.


Other than that the main 'slums' area is basically a big playground if you aren't trying to solve puzzles or do quests.  Letting them play there would be fine.
                    Thanks for the info, I appreciate it!
                I'm halfway through the game, and there are a few chase scenes where you get swarmed by robotic insects. Some people might find that uncomfortable, especially children. I think it's pretty family friendly, though. If you get hit by a bug, it's not graphic, they just latch onto you. The cat can die if there are enough insects on you, but the screen just gets redder then fades to black. It's also obvious when you are in a dangerous area, and most of the game you are in a safe area, so you can take over the controller to handle the dangerous parts if your kids get too scared. Also, some of the robots are implied to curse, but it's censored ******.
    It's really good so far.

            Think you need to scratch *all* points in all levels for an achievement. I didn't get one, but I also didn't really hunt them down.
    Shaun!
Anyone know any other games with a world like Stray cause I think I'm in love.

Edit:

Thanks for the recommendations! I'll definitely need to have a look at these.
    Flower and journey.
        Holy shit I haven't played Flower in like a decade. I loved that game.
            I wish I could just enjoy Flower but I'm so bad at controlling the wind it ends up being a frustrating experience for me. I know it's 100% my fault. The setting is beautiful.
                Can’t you adjust the sensitivity on that? Or have you and it still frustrates you?
        Journey is one of my favourite games ever. The ending feels like what I imagine dying and going to heaven is like. I've played it multiple times just to experience that ending again.
            I was tripping while playing journey the first time and it all made so much sense to me in that mindset. You’re going through life, some parts of it are really fun and easy like the sand sliding level. Some parts are hard and scary like the parts where the metal whales are chasing you. People come into your journey randomly and some stay for just a little while, some of them stay with you through several chapters of your life, even to the end. Climbing the final mountain with a companion you had for a majority of the game was actually emotional. Then the rebirth and ascension to the top of the mountain, only to slowly walk into the light together again. Unbelievable game
        Abzu as well. Flow is a neat one too.
        Journey is soooooooooooo good. Played that for the very first time ever while on some mushrooms and it was so beautiful
    Abzu

Edit: also Sable. I haven't checked it out myself yet but wishlisted for later
        Abzu is very good
        Like the other person said, Sable is freaking *gorgeous.* It's got decently fun yet simple gameplay to it as well.
        Sable is amazing. A bit buggy but so beautiful
        im playing sable on the side right now. such a chill game
        Sable is beautiful. I just wish the “call bike” function actually worked. The Japanese Breakfast soundtrack makes up for it though.
        Abzu is great on acid.
            I played through that whole game just on the other side of a peak from 4 tabs.

Legit had tears during that last sequence with the music and colors and all. 

Absolutely incredible game. 10/10. 20/10 on acid.
    Little kitty big city is an upcoming indie game where you play as a cat, has lots in common
        >Little kitty big city

That looks so adorable...
    Little Nightmares
        [deleted]
            I think that it has enough similarities that people who enjoy Stray would also like Little Nightmares. 

Both rely on the player solving puzzles to get through obstacles, strange & unsettling background settings, simple gameplay that doesn’t require much focus, short gameplay, ambient soundtrack, and both games follow the main character on a journey.
    I got a similar feeling from Firewatch. Exploratory and ambiance.
    Cloudpunk sorta. It’s a softer, sometimes lighthearted voxel-styled cyberpunk game.

Selling point is being a relaxing hovercar drive around game.

Similar chill vibe.
        Cloudpunk is a really chill game...until it isn't.
    Tokyo Jungle
        As in you play as an animal, sure... anything else, no, not really.
        Possibly the most underrated game of all time. I spent so much time unlocking all those damn animals.
    Lost Ember
    I've gotta second Flower as far as the chill vibe, though it doesn't have the intellectual depth that Stray has (dealing with hard subjects like poverty, human greed, etc...) Flower is literally just drifting in a field as a gust of wind and hitting all the flowers until the field lights up and brings you to the next little maze. 

As far as the theme goes, Detroit Become Human has that futuristic wasteland/ AI-taking-over type of vibe and it's got a really good message to it too. Plus you can make choices throughout the game, giving you different outcomes based on what you choose.  If you haven't already played this one of course lol, I know it was pretty popular when it came out
    It’s an older game, but prior to playing Stray it reminded me of Tokyo Jungle, the gameplay is not at all similar but wandering around a city as a small animal has its similarities.
    Spirit of the North is similar not in world design, but in general concept; you play an animal and just get dropped into the world with no real idea what's actually going on, at the beginning.  And as you progress you learn more and more about the environment.
    The closest thing is Machinarium honestly
Spoilers ish for the ending:
>! I really wish there was an after credit sequence where your cat met up with the cats from the beginning of the game, only thing it was missing imo. !<
10/10, would meow again.
    >!That’s the only thing that kinda disappointed me but I also would’ve cried!<
    I’m hoping we get a sequel or DLC where that happens
        I think we will with the little tease at the end
        It was a mass success for BlueTwelve studios. I'm really hoping for a sequel, seems likely with the semi-open ending and the positive feedback. I'd love a sequel!
    For real, I went through the whole game like “yeah, gonna reunite you with your buddies” And then B12 dies and I can’t pick him up and take him with me in hopes of finding someone to repair him. And then the door opens and I think “this is it, even closer to finding my pals.” Nope. Fuck me. Overall loved the game though.
The comments here clearly indicate how everyone is different in terms of what they are looking for in games. I'm only early on in Stray - having played for just a few minutes last night - but I think I'm going to enjoy the full experience.

I went into this knowing it's a short game, but I don't mind that. Not every game needs to be long. I'm a busy person, so I appreciate experiences like this. The gameplay is simple but engaging, and the audiovisual design is worth the price of admission.
    Possibly my favorite game of all time is called Inside. It's a simple left-to-right puzzle platformer of sorts with an intense moody atmosphere and mysterious/eerie setting. Not too long, but definitely worth multiple playthroughs. And the sound design is absolutely on point. I'd highly recommend it, especially since it's not too long.
        Got it on sale last year and it was great. I'm assuming you've played Limbo as well?
        Thanks. Inside has a trial and is currently 75% off.
            It's coming to Game Pass as well.
        Inside was great. Made by the same people who made Limbo I believe, which is also really good.
        That game was cool. Little easy and short but really cool atmosphere.

Gameplay reminds me quite a bit of some older (but more challenging) games like Prince or Persia, Another World, and Flashback.

Blackthorn is another rad old game that’s similar, but with a shotgun!
            Yooo, Blackthorn was one of the first games I played on my garage sale homemade pc back in the late 90s. A Blizzard classic.
                Hey I was playing the shareware version back then too, windows 3.1 machine with a whopping 25 MHz cpu. 😂

I have the snes rom and still go back and play it every couple years or so. Still fun.
                    I loved blackthorn too!!
        I have a feeling you don't know Limbo. If you don't, you'll love it. I've played inside once. I've played Limbo about 6 times already and I don't replay games. Like at all. (It's from the same studio, their previous game, absolute masterpiece).
            So I had the misfortune of playing Limbo *after* I played Inside. It's hard for me to want to go back to Limbo knowing I could replay Inside instead. Something about Inside resonated more with me than Limbo, even though it's a great game in its own right. 

I also have to admit I think Inside is the better game. Visually, game-play, and sound design just hits more. Seems like the studio took what they learned from Limbo and applied it to Inside.
                Interesting, I would argue the opposite :D. Inside is a larger project, but I've loved the journey in Limbo. It's a journey through life and while I wouldn't form that idea on my own, I've surely felt it while playing:

The boy died in the forest and awakens in limbo (the world between life and death). The soul can only get out of limbo when the body is properly buried. The boy continues through limbo until his sister finds and buries his body. In the ending scene, she is covering his grave.

Also, the whole journey is like a journey through life. Fear of spiders and water is overcome only to be replaced of the fear of bullying, character goes from forests to work environment and so on and so forth.

Anyways, the point is, I love Limbo because of that artistic overarching vision that guided the project. I was surprised that I didn't have that feeling with Inside.
        Yep. I mean, folks can enjoy whatever they like and I don't mind if people prefer longer games. That's totally cool. But the crowd who totally dismiss shorter games and accuse devs of being lazy or whatever... they're missing the point by a country mile. Games like Inside are examples of shorter, beautifully-crafted experiences. I'm not suggesting that folks have to like them - to each their own - but it's the dismissal and naysaying that annoys me.
            Agreed. Why dismiss these shorter games? What have you got to lose? I'd happily play an engaging several hour experience rather than the same multiplayer shoot-loot-shoot-loop on repeat. But you're right: everyone has the right to their own preferences.
        Inside is awesome
        So you ever heard of this game called… Little Nightmares
    I enjoy my big AAA 60 hour open worlds, but a nice short little game like this with great polish and atmosphere makes for a superb pallet cleanser
    I prefer short games now. I don't have the time to play long games. It's reached the point where if a game is supposed to be a huge, sprawling experience it kinda pushes me away from trying it.

I work constantly all week and maybe have 3-4 hours to play a game every couple weeks. I can't play all these 100+ hour games like I could in high school and college.
        Yep, that’s me with Red Dead. 

The grind of a massive map, doing tiny little tasks. I enjoy the idea of it, but then I actually get into it and… aaaa
        I love strategy games and I always struggle with this. I’ll have a free weekend and just dump hours into an EU4 game. Then a month later when I have time, I load it up like ‘wtf was I even doing?’ and start a new game.
    [deleted]
    Majority of Reddit is a bunch of entitled kids who want to only see things they like and anything else is garbage. I’m insanely excited to play this game and everything about it is up my alley
    My ideal length for games is 20 to 30 hours. I’ll happily play shorter games but not longer games. 

Games I have enjoyed:
- The Pathless

- The Last of Us

- Spider-Man 2018


Games I will play:
- TLOU2 

- Spider-Man MM

- Stray (started yesterday)

- Firewatch

Games that are too big for me 
- AC: Valhalla

- RDR2

- Cyberpunk


I’d happily take suggestions on unique, beautiful, fun up to 30 hour games.
        If you don't lock yourself up in a bunch of side quests you can beat cyberpunk in around 20 hours

Anyone knows if the musical score was released. Really liking the synth music in the game play trailer
    It's on Spotify
    Saw it on steam today
I hate myself for playing it for a whole day today and finishing it so quickly, the game is great and music is masterpiece but I wish it was longer
    It would have been nice if it were a little longer as long as the gameplay was more varried

I would have hated if they extended the pop-a-bug section.
    There's an achievement for doing the whole game in under two hours. I'll give it a go now I've played through it once. It'll be an interesting challenge.
        Yeah, it's pretty easy you can do it in around one and a half hours so there is a lot of time to spare
    How many hours did it take you?
        Around 5 first time and 1,5 while doing it for the second time for trophy
            Wow, wasn’t expecting it to be THAT short. Stray has been my most anticipated GOTY so it’s a bit disappointing to hear that it’s not longer but I’m sure it’s jam packed with great content! Would rather it be shorter and really well done than long where everything seems like it’s dragging on.
    Can't wait to play it. I think of games like this (Journey, Abzu) kind of like a movie experience. I usually spend around $30 at AMC for a ticket and popcorn, and if I really like the movie I'll watch it multiple times (at home or sometimes even again in the theater) and catch new things the second watch through.
What a pleasant game. Easily one of best games of 2022. Press B to meow!

Can you spray things in that game? I wanna spray random things with my scent and pee on piles of clean clothes
    What button do you press to drag your butt across the freshly cleaned carpet?

What about leaving a pile of slimy unchewed food?
        Anyone got the “bring in a dead bird and leave it next to the bed” collectable?
            No sorry only the bring in an almost dead bird that starts flapping around like crazy as soon as the cat lets go causing chaos and a lot of stress collectable
        you CAN scratch up carpets and the occasional wall.
            So are there a lot of vertical climbing surfaces?  Or is it just curtains?  Never played it… but my cats insist curtains are made for just that.
                I’ve come across one curtain to scratch up so far
    Also can you just paw things off a dresser or counter just to be an asshole? Wouldn’t be a cat game without that.
        That's actually the way you solve some of the puzzles.

        Yes...  I literally knocked every paint can, bottle, coffee cup off every ledge I could while playing through.
        Yes. Repeatedly
    Hopefully you can chew on a plant and then throw it up a couple minutes later as well. I’ll refund if I can’t.
        I feel this.  My cat eats every stupid ass thing.
    My cats do that in real life.
        So do mine
    You can’t even jump in it. It’s a huge letdown for me
Sadly the game is giving me major motion sickness. If anyone has any suggestions on settings I could change which might help, please let me know.
    Motion blur is often a culprit that causes that. See if you can disable it
        Motion sickness is always the first thing I turn off.

            Did people downvote this comment for some reason or does reddit just like hiding comments for having just a small amount of upvotes?
                I was thinking the same thing.  Comment was hidden, but didn't say it was below the score threshold.  Was assuming it was someone saying "ACKSHUALLY...".  But no...regular ol' comment.
                    I saw it okay among all the comments in the thread (BaconReader on mobile)
    Sitting in a cardboard box will help keep you oriented. Make sure it's the smallest one you can fit in so your body is making 4 points of constant contact.
        So I need to become an actual cat, got it.
            Make sure to knock things off of shelves and tables too.
        Don't close the box though, or no one will know if you're alive or not.
        Is this serious? If it is...
    Aside from motion blur as others have mentioned, excessive monitor brightness can cause it in some cases. As well as too wide FoV if you're playing on PC on an ultrawide.
    Me too. Turned motion blur off like I do for every game, but started feeling sick after about 30 minutes.
    Turn off motion blur. It's literally used to disguise framerate drops. I turn it off in every game. Just the stupidest "feature" ever.
        Why this homie getting down voted he is dead ass right.
        I actually like motion blur. I know that sacrilegious to say but I don't care. I understand that it can be implemented to hide frame drops but I still like it. I don't think that it's bad just because it has a purpose other than it's surface value. 

I'll keep it on, even when my 3080 is pushing solid 120+ frames.
            [Removing all my posts and comments due to Reddit's fuckery with third party apps. June 2023]
    I'm having the same issue, which is pretty usual for me sadly. If they'd add a FOV slider or something similar, that would help a lot.
        There’s no fov slider? 


Aaannnnnd I’m not buying it till there’s a mod to fix that.

Edit: downvote me if you want. I like cats too, but we need to have standards. It’s ridiculous not to have an fov slider in 2022.
            Not sure why this is so downvoted. I can understand not everyone caring about fov sliders but as stated here it is important for some people. And tbh in 2022 tthey should be almost standard across the board considering how many years people have been complaining about a lack of fov sliders in games.
            TotalBiscuit's spirit lives on. There is zero reason a game shouldn't have options for every effect the game has. Some games the effects don't bother me and others they are obnoxious.
            I agree with you. Fov slider should be in every game by default. I was thinking buying this but if theres no fov option i wont. Im one of those people who get motion sickness when fov is too low cant play games with low fov. I will upvote you if it helps.
    Welcome to my life. Can I ask you about some others? The last of us? The Witcher 3? V rising? 

Also if you can turn the FOV up on anything that helps tremendously
    Check the fov and see if it can be changed. That always gives me motion sickness.
    Its not motion blur. You have no frame of reference where you're looking. Turn the pointer thingy on. Makes it Purrfect
    Turn on the crosshair and focus on it during gameplay.
    Oh no! I get motion sickness really easy so this worries me
        I get major, major motion sickness (even riding in the passenger side of a car in the front when someone else is driving makes me feel sick anymore, a common issue for people with migraines), and I felt fine after turning off motion blur and capping the FPS
Downloaded it at 2pm..   played uninterrupted until 9pm.. when I finished the game.  

Pretty fun!
LOL. I'm nearly finished already. absolutely love this game. wish it was longer

this is probably already known by most people here but for anyone who doesn't know, you can let the cat sleep for an hour to get the productive day trophy. at first I was like, aw cute it sleeps but why lol. also wanted to know if I had to let him recharge. you don't. it's mostly for the trophy and for ambiance. you can fall asleep next to the music robot (forget the name) after giving it a piece of sheet music you want played as well. could make for a good nap time for you as well lol. just thought I'd mention for anyone who didn't know!
    My favorite spot to sleep is >!Clementine's Flat!<
        I love that spot too. So cozy ☺️
    wow what a game
I wanna give it a try sometime.
    Just to make sure you are on safe side. Make sure your computer can run this game. I bought this game since I was visiting family, and my older PC which is like 6 years old couldn't run this game. A lot of people are having trouble with the game off Steam. 

Apparently something with PS5 exclusive allowed people to get the game for free.
I agree with a lot of the issues on gameplay (too linear, easy puzzles) but there are so few games with this aesthetic that I try to support every one I find. 

Last game with an art style I loved this much was Quadrilateral Cowboy and I still play it sometimes.
    its not supposed to be an open world nor a challenging game if thats what your expectations were
    I thought A Short Hike and Obra Dinn were incredible art-wise but I don’t think they appeal to everyone.
This game is great but made me tear up so many times. I lost my cat this year and hearing the cat meow in my headphones makes me miss her.
    I had to pause and take a minute to regain emotional stability after the dreaded fall at the beginning of the game.. Still upsets me just thinking about it.

Losing your cat is one of the most painful experiences in the world. I am sorry to hear that you had to say goodbye, and I hope that you find peace, comfort, and joy in remembering the love you shared with her. <3
        Yeah the fall had me go "oh no nononono NO". The murrs of panic and pain had me teary eyed.
I don’t see why everybody gets so defensive when someone mentions the short length or the easiness or the linearity. It’s not personal; they’re valid critiques.
    I love the linearity. Whenever i play a nonlinear game i feel like i have to discover everything and do every side mission or i will miss out
Twenty five quid seems a lot for under 5hrs of gameplay. I’ll wait for a sale
    You can play it for free. New playstation account plus the PS+ Extra 7 day trial.
    Is the game only five hours long?
        I explored a fair amount, and I got about 6 hours of game play. Which isn't a bad thing. I think if the game were longer it might have felt a tiny bit dragged out. 

I think it's really worth the price. The movement, music, and world building were all great. It's been a long time since I've played a game that's just it's own thing. Nothing complicated, no in depth mechanics. The game is what it says it is and honestly it was an incredibly refreshing experience. Perfect game for a "non-gamer" too, if you're trying to get one of your loved ones into the hobby. 

That said, I absolutely love cats so my bias may be speaking a bit here.
            Makes me hopeful for a sequel, or even better, and more lengthy storyline. It wouldn’t even necessarily need to change the formula or assets up. Just more of what it’s already doing.
        Depends on how much you explore and how much of the backstory/collectables you are hunting.  

There is an achievement for finishing it in under two hours, but I'm looking at an easy 8-10.
            Ah, so it's the length of 1 run through a Dwemer ruins.
                its infinitely more fun though
        I finished the game in a single playthrough, being curious and talking to everyone, rubbing against legs and everything.  

7 hours of gameplay beginning to end.   

Netting about 45% of the trophies blind.
        My son just finished it today, it's not that long
        I've played 8 and I'm at 40 something percent, so not necessarily. I've also missed some of the collectibles. 

If you are only doing the story and not looking around at all, then maybe, but even the first level is large and complex enough imo that it'd probably be difficult unless you've played it and are going for the achievement.

I bought it before it came out and I really don't regret the price.
        I'm currently at 6 hours, trying to get all of the achievements, and I've only reached the mid-to-end portion of the game. However, I did spend around an hour of my time just  exploring, appreciating, and casually messing around as an adorable kitty.. It's definitely something I never realized I wanted to so badly in a video game! XD
    I mean if you just run through the story, sure. It took me like 3.5 hours to go through the first little town. If you just enjoy the world and being there it adds so much

But either way 25 seems like a fine price for what I got
    6 hrs of story gameplay. You can do whatever the heck you want along that way, so I don't see the problem, the point of this game is to simulate the cat life. But if you only play game to finish them then I don't think any of these type of game would worth it for you.
    I don’t get how people have the correlation that length of game = price of game. Should shorter movies cost less and longer cost more? Dont they both have the same level of effort and craft (to a degree/depending)?
        Movies typically have a much shorter range of runtimes. And much shorter run times overall. 75 minutes minimum to what, 150, 180 max. The significant value metric isnt quantity here.

But games can go from 2 hours to 100+ in some cases. This spread is enough that most people would pay significantly more for a long game with the same quality as a short one. Time spent becomes a significant metric, because quality being equal, I'm getting much more value out of a longer game. With such a long spread in playtimes, significantly more development effort is also spent on longer games than shorter ones.

That's not to say time is the only metric, of course.
        Yup. Even still if you get enjoyment out of it you're paying $5.00/hr to have fun.
        As someone who games 40+ hours a week, I can't afford to be dropping $30 on something I can knock out in a few hours. Bigger and longer doesn't necessarily mean better, but I have played plenty of excellent games (including some masterpieces) that I was able to sink 100+ hours into at a cheaper price than this game. If it ever drops to $10 I'll give it a whirl.
    That’s the price of a meal you eat in 15 minutes.
        25$ can feed you for a week in some places
    Only 5 hours? Wtf?
        It's a game about being a cat, not sure what you expected lol. This isn't going to be some Mass Effect level of story.
            It’s actually funny, there’s quite a bit of interesting story being presented and I was just running after a ball, pawing at it while they were talking about it. 

It’s very much a cat simulator lol
        What exactly did you expect?
    Yeah I’m no hater, I’d like to play this because it seems like a pretty good game. But no way is it $30 USD good, not for 5 hours of gameplay
        If you want to buy the game just grab the PlayStation version of gamepass. Half the price ($40 vs $21 here in Canada) and you can play it and all kinds of other shit. 

Literally why it was a day one service game was to motivate people towards this. Just cancel before your month is up. Don't allow auto renew.
I wish we'd have this on psp
    pspspspspspspsp
I just want the cat to occasionally just ignore all your controls like a real cat would do.
    Have you put the paper bag over your head yet? Controls become reversed!
Even if it’s $30 for 5 hours, that’s $6 an hour. That’s less than lunch for two. It’s totally worth it. It’s a cute game with an adorable aesthetic and *totally* worth it. Meowsassin’s Creed
    yeah I see alota people complaining about it being overpriced for a 5 hour walking sim. But the allure of the game is the ambiance and being emersed in the beautiful world. If you wanted some complex long gaming experience. Prob should just play a different game as thats not the intended experience.
    What they call walking sim I call adventure game. Find the thing that makes other things do things. But instead of pointing and clicking you're a cat with very satisfying movement in an amazingly rendered world.

People are losers
        Totally. Cats are way better
    That's maybe not much for you but for people that are working min wage (10.79 euro ish here)  it is
        That’s not the problem of the game developer. That’s the problem of the customer. The game is “half a game” according to the playtime argument, and it’s half the price of a standard PS5 game.
    Yeah I find it absurd the amount of people who focus on price to length ratio. Sure that’s fine if it was less than an hour long or something but buying lunch or a movie ticket “can” be around the price of the game and yet no one complains about spending 20+ concessions to see Thor in imax but oh no this price is stupid. If the game doesn’t interest for the price it’s at now then just wait cause there’s plenty of people who think the price is exactly what it should be. There’s just something so entitled about complaining about something like this. If you only have a certain amount to spend and you want something that’ll last you longer that’s understandable but don’t get mad at the game.
Meow
    Meow meow
I'm still playing the game but does anyone know if you can miss memories? I was way too scared of trying to get Doc that I've missed some memories and it's irritating me
    You definitely can miss them, and you'll have to replay as there doesn't seem to be a ng+.
    There is a chapter select after you finish the game so technically nothing is missable. It will tell you how many memories in each chapter you have out of how many there are so you know how many you’re missing. Just make sure that when you do this, that you collect a memory and then continue playing until there is a cutscene or save icon, otherwise it might not register (if you quit the chapter right away).
        thank you so much!
I'm about 3 hours in. I personally feel like this is really fresh and so creative. I'm a big fan of games like Inside, Limbo, Journey, Abzu, Edith Finch, etc... So I'm biased! However, I feel that people are focusing SO much on the cat that they're missing how rich and thoughtfully constructed the game is. The gameplay is as simple as it could be—but it works. That simplicity allows the player to enjoy all of the intricacy of the world; the culture of the robots, the curious nostalgia of this post-apocalyptic landscape, the sweet and optimistic relationships between characters, the spectacular soundtrack. It's not for everyone. But I certainly don't find it boring, the pacing seems quite effective. I think it is a game that demands a lot of the player, however. It is kind of only interesting if the player allows simple aspects of the game's world and environment to become the meaning of the experience. I think that if it's taken to be almost meditative—if its pace is accepted—it has a lot to offer. And it's so clearly a labor of love!

The one thing I don’t like about this game so far is the saving. We’re in 2022 and can’t save whenever we want?

    you're a bot
        No YOU'RE a towel.
Still haven't played enough to really judge. But so far, TO ME, its the cat equivalent of Death Standing. A beautiful yet extremely boring walking simulator.
    I really like the slow pace and the atmosphere. I can see how it wouldn’t be everyone’s bag though.
    Death Stranding broke you. 😂
        lol, yeah, I couldn't even finish Death Stranding. I kept waiting for it to be fun, couple hours in I gave up.
            Feel your pain. I did the same, but for RDR2.
        Death Stranding broke me too lmao. I stopped playing a little over halfway through. great graphics and music. cool backstory. but just got tried of making sam walk, esp when I was carrying heavy things for transport. ugh :(
How many posts of this game are being made? This is an advert, and filling my feed.
It's short. That's my only beef, but it also isn't a "full price title. It's beautiful and is like the video game equivalent of ambient music.
    Its a first game by a small studio, after their successes i imagine their next game would be far bigger.
Looks great on PC
    It does


I would like more fur though
        As a prior cat owner, no you wouldn't. 

Oh you meant in game.
        That and I wish I could control the jump instead of jumping where it tells me
Would this be a good game i can buy for my daughter? She's 7 years old and loves cats.
    Nooooo the cat can die and it's horrible and traumatic
Its easy to respawn but omg the first time it happened? Forget it. I cried and I'm in my 40s
I'm not much of a gamer but got this because the concept was too cute to resist. Luckily my SO has a ps4. Perfect for casual gamers. 
I'm loving it so far! SO wholesome and cute.   

I'm a softy though, teared up a lot when kitty got separated from the rest of the family
Such a simple game but very exciting
That comes out today, doesn't it??
This game is excellent!
Wow I actually got this game today and I didn’t expect to see a meme about it already! Really good game and people should get it
All I see is PUSS IN BOOTS!
indie game with the most advertising I've ever seen
Made by the best studio: Annapurrrrna
Get up we have a pspspsps to burn
Field of View is way too low, I'm waiting for a fix...
I feel like I'm the only one who got anxiety from this game. I didn't expect the Zurk things, and the atmosphere and music made me feel really anxious. People made it seem like it was just a cute game where you play as a cat. I'm sad because I really want a cute game like that but this game felt unsettling. I do have panic disorder though, so... :/
Pspspspsps
Is there a joke I'm not understanding...?
    [deleted]
        I didn't even realize I'd missed a joke, until I got this far..
    Its the sound you make when you want to get a cats attention.
I don't understand the hype behind the game,  you're a cat...and?
    The hype is literally that you are a cat. People love cats.  What's not to like?

But what it actually comes down to is a beautiful game with well thought out gameplay and a clever story.  Plus you're a cat and can push things off shelves.
It's a 4 hour tech demo
    But tech demo sell very well on ps5
Fun fact: my cat is the only cat in the world that doesn't respond to this sound. Just sorta looks at me like, "can you please shut the fuck up?"
    Many cats don't respond.
        They always respond to German.
Most overhyped game I've ever seen.
Biggest shill campaign I have ever seen.
It’s free to play if you have the premium subscription :)

    > I was expecting some kinda skyrim levels of free exploration

Expecting an indie walking simulator to equal a AAA production heavily focused on exploration is not as reasonable as you may believe.
        Imagine paying $30 for a 4 hour walking simulator.
            You're right people paid 60 for Death Stranding to deliver Amazon packages.
            I've paid close to that for one meal, and more than half of that to see a movie. I'm not interested in this specific walking simulator, but I'm also not opposed to the idea in principle.
                Look at mister money bags over here
            This is what happens when you are raised on mobile and free to play games.
            Four hours in and no regrets.  I've spent more on visual novels.  Different strokes for different folks but this is a charming game. 

It's also not purely a walking sim. There's puzzles etc
            $30 dollars is nothing for a decent game. Get a better job
                I can't get a better job. Can you gift me a copy since it's nothing to you?
            I pay more than that to see a 1.5 hour movie at the cinemas, haha. So $30 for a beautiful, contained experience is no problem at all.
                I just upgraded the rest of my ps+ subscription for $15. So I can play Stray and whatever else on the list that I want to for the next 5 months
        Lmao people are allowed to dislike something you like Jesus. Just because it's indie doesn't mean people can't dislike it because it wasn't what they were looking for.
            I never said they weren't allowed to dislike it, and since I haven't played the game I don't like or dislike it myself. What I tried to say was that their expectations were just ridiculous. It's like buying Bloodborne and being disappointed that the map size can't rival Ubisoft open-worlds.
    Honestly I expected the game to be much more like a ww2 simulator. There arent any tanks. There arent any air planes. Not even so much as a m1 Garand. You cant shoot enemies. You cant even storm the beaches of Normandy. It's just so simple and empty.
        I heard there's a Grumman F6F Hellcat.
            Ok I will keep looking for sure
        Honestly I expected the game to be much more like a Star Wars simulator. There arent any AT-ATs. There arent any TIE Fighters. Not even so much as an E-Web. You cant set blasters to stun. You cant even have the high ground. It's just so simple and empty.
            Honestly I expected the game to be much more like a Tenchu 3: Wrath of Heaven remake. There arent any katanas. There arent any grappling hooks. Not even so much as some rice. You cant kill for Lord Gohda. You cant even be a ninja. It's just so simple and empty.
        It's about a "cat" not a "gat", I can see the confusion though.
    I thought this was a copypasta and the Skyrim comparison was gonna keep going
    Wow. All these incredibly enthusiastic posts with nothing but rave reviews are suddenly seeming so disingenuous.  
    
Can't jump in a cat game? What a joke.
        The jumping system they have now makes it much more realistic to how a cat would actually traverse. It's not a 3D mario platformer, or a survival cat RPG, it's an adventure game where you play as a cat.
            Yes.

When my cat is wearing her backpack and solving puzzles around the house, I noticed she only jumps when a prompt come up.

100% realism confirmed.
            So wait, you CAN jump?  Cause the person I replied said there's no jumping at all.
                My understanding is that jumping is a context button.

In other words, you can only jump when and where the game lets you.
                    It feels like the Zipline and ledge grabbing in the Arkham games.
                    You can jump onto most surfaces and platforms, its not a restrictive as you are making it seem
                What they meant was you can't just jump whenever you want. Stand next to ledge or a gap and a button prompt will appear on screen. Press the button and the cat does a jump to where the prompt was. 

I didn't buy the game but I agree with them it looks very limiting. Sure the way they've done it the animations look smooth and very realistic but I personally enjoy my freedom to hop around like an idiot in other games.
                    Whenever you find yourself asking "Hey, it looks like I should be able to jump there, can I jump there?", the VAST majority of the time the answer is going to be yes. 

Jumping is a fundamental part of the game. I often found myself jumping to places that didn't even lead to anything. So it's not as if the only jumps you can make are the ones on the story path.
                        I haven't played it. I'm waiting for actual reviews to come out instead of OMG CAT!!1! 

I'm glad you find it non limiting and open. Personally to me it looks very limited and I think the game probably just isn't for me. If you're enjoying it, more power to you.
                It's a canned animation. You push the button and it just does it for you. You don't aim it, you can't miss time it. That's probably what he means. It has jumping in the same way that one CoD game had respect paying. You push the button and the game plays itself. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing but a lot of people seemed to think this was gonna be a cat platformer.
                Technically yes, it's a big part of the game. It's odd but I think it fits very well with what the game is. I don't think a normal jumping system would fit with how the levels work.
        That's exactly what stopped me from buying it. I was ready to buy it on launch but I watched a review last night where the guy was trying to be enthusiastic but still mentioned the prompt based jumping and I was immediately turned off.
            This is sounding like a morbius situation, but I think people are doing it unironically, like they like the thought of a cat game and can't see any flaws with it. Is this game actually considered good or not?
                I'm throughly enjoying it and some of the "you  can't jump" comments are making me laugh cause it sounds like people expected cat parkour.

It's a linear story about a cat who is just chilling with their cat clan until they fall into a walled in city where all the humans are dead but robots remain.  

You find out what's going on by proceeding through the city. There's puzzles, memories and collectibles along the way. 

You can scratch things, meow your head off, trip a robot, rub against a robot,  break items etc. You have to not be nommed by half like looking bugs when you're not in robot city 

I'm four hours in and I'm throughly enjoying it so far cause I'm also looking for everything without a walk-through.

So, if you like that sort of thing then it's a good game for you. If not then no. But it's definitely a good game IMHO
                I think it's getting attention because it's different which is great. But from what I've gathered from other comments it's pretty and you can do a lot of cat stuff but except for specific circumstances it's pointless actions and it still feels lacking.
        Right? The viral marketing tactics for this game are insane. It doesn't even look interesting.
        The jumping system they have now makes it much more realistic to how a cat would actually traverse. It's not a 3D mario platformer, or a survival cat RPG, it's an adventure game where you play as a cat.
            Well it's also a video game about a cat solving puzzles. Kinda weird to think the jumping system is fine because it's realistic when the entire premise of the game is fantasy.
                They are still trying simulate a real cat protagonist. Without the odd claw durability system and hunger meter that others wanted.
        You are jumping all the time, but you can only jump if you have somewhere to jump TO. Cats don't just randomly bounce up and down (unless maybe playing with a ball). They walk or jog along, and the lithely jump to a specific ledge, or down, or whatever. You can jump loads, and really are jumping all the time, it is just a jump with deliberation.
    I kind of wanted customization too, but to be fair I guess it's based off of an actual cat so they wanted it to look like him lol. still would have been cool to make him look like my cat though
        It sounds like people got their expectations way too high thinking this was supposed to be some big cat RPG when it's literally never been advertised as such so I'm not sure where all this confusion is coming from. It reminds me of people getting angry about lightyear because Tim Allen wasn't in it and they couldn't understand or fathom the possibility that a product could be different than how fans would imagine things to be due to hype or expectations that grow to a fever pitch so we end up disappointing ourselves all on our own (generally speaking)
            Lol true. I’m super happy with the game tbh. I played for hours yesterday and didn’t feel bored ever once.
    You should have been expecting nothing so whatever you got is good then
    This is great bait haha
I feel bad for anyone that actually believes this. Ngl tho you almost had me until you expected a Skyrim style rpg.
        Well, with how Reddit and other platforms have hyped it up, I'm not surprised he thought that. The hype for this game is unreal, this studio produces indie, linear gems like What Remains of Edith Finch, and this detail is lost when people describe and hype this game as the next huge thing, the game isn't trying to advertise itself as something so grand, it's own fanbase is doing that sadly.
        Have you played it? How is what he said wrong? Cause I’m playing it right now and it’s pretty boring
        Who says we're expecting a Skyrim style RPG? The point is it lacks basic features. You'd think you can free roam and jump around whereever in a game like this.
            The OP of the thread you're talking in said that.
    I had a feeling this would be a giant shlock but god damn it exceeded my expectations in that department
    [deleted]
    I'm almost at the same point, asking for refund, so far it's very boring. And all the mechanics of the game/puzzles are meaningless and extremely guided. I feel like I'm just progressing a never ending cut scene.
    Its a cat, how many times have you seen a cat randomly jumping arround.
Stray PSP de-make confirmed...
    Literally... Wtf does pspspspspspspsp mean?
        https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pspspsps

>Pspspsps is an onomatopoeia used to recreate the sound some make to get the attention of a cat. It has been used in a series of jokes about futile attempts to attract a cat.
        It's an onomatopoeia that you say to attract a cat.

perchance.
            You can’t just say perchance.
        It's the noise people make to get a cat's attention.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pspspsps
            Ahhh thank you!!! I've recently gotten into modding my PS Vita and so I've become aware of the emulator named PPSSPP. 

I was very much confused.
                That's awesome  that you modded your Vita.  I have a modded PSP 3000.  It still has great games.
wait so we really have a post with 20k upvotes that is only one picture of a game ans his name ? wtf ?? 

Ads are getting smarter
Overhyped.
    The "hype" was "I get to be cat" and nothing else so idk, I got exactly what I wanted
        same. I was so freaking excited the moment it started and I could start playing with the other cats. This game could have had no real story to it and I'd still return to play in from time to time just for the pure joy of getting to be a cat and explore lmao
So much viral marketing spam. They're trying so hard to get people to buy half a game.
    Rubbish. It looks to me like we're getting exactly what was promised in the trailers. AFAIK there was no indication about the game's length ahead of launch. Now that it's available and reviews are out, folks can decide whether or not they want a longer game and if this is worth the price of entry. But let's not start slinging mud at developers and suggest they're spamming us. We can do better than that.
        The developers confirmed over a month ago the game would be eight hours in length. I'm going at a moderate pace, and it looks like the game will take me six hours to complete, so the game is about the length they said it would be.
    I'm drunk and thought it was a cute game with a cat, but I love that you think I'm clever enough to get paid for this shit.
        Gamers are seriously some of the most miserable fucks on the planet lmao
            +1 

so many bitter entitled fucks. Same ones sending death threats to developers for not making the Fortnite skin they wanted. Not your cup of tea? Move on, nobody cares.
            For real. Unable to enjoy or appreciate anything.
        Sure, you're drunk
PS4 physical?
    Not until Q4, I believe.
Overpriced cat game that gets way too much hype from Sony fan boys
    Go back to your xbone and cod and let us enjoy being a cat
Ksksksksss
Okay, there's a few problems here and there, sure. Like occasional clipping, the animations can be a little jerky, and most importantly the game sometimes really struggles with implementing vertical gameplay in a compelling and atmospheric environment. What I'm saying is that there's A LOT of times when you clearly see that you should 100% be able to climb a building or something using the very prominent ledges and whatnot but the game just won't allow you to.
But that's honestly about it. Other than that this game is literally everything we've been waiting for, it really doesn't disappoint.
Was playing this with my cat on my lap for a few hours tonight 10/10 I love the pace so far and exploration, really neat idea and good execution so far.
I played this entire game last night and it was just so fucking good. I have to play it again though as I missed a few memories and I'm really annoyed about it.
[removed]
    LMAO I thought I’d pop into this sub to see what it thought of this cute game, stayed for the cringy edgelord reactions.
        Hardly an edge lord reaction, the game does nothing unique and is a walking simulator.
            gAmInG iS dEaD
great game
I hate the game. It's overpriced if you don't get it for free with the playstation plus. You can't argue it's not. It's 5 hours long if you just play through your first time without looking for the collectables and it's $30. Most of the game is scripted such as the jump ability. Not being able to jump freely removes all difficulty from the game and pretty much makes this game nothing but a walking simulator with a story and a few puzzles. I know I'm going to get hate for this but it's the truth. This game is over hyped only because you get to play as a cat. If you played as a human nobody would praise the game.
Pspspsp
Can you no scope 360?
Good to see that the game is less than a day old and there are already images like this
I don't understand...
Best Indie game this year imo
The creator is around here somewhere. He posted this a while back while it was in alpha(?).

So far it is fun and easy going.
I honestly just wanted a cute cat simulator my kid could play. This is definitely not that.
I love that this isn't even really a joke, it kinda is lol.
    Sweet can't wait to play then.
    Wait what
        It feels a bit like Half Life at times
            I just started, im looking forward to the crowbar, g-man and console commands
                So now that you've had some time, what do you think of the zurks?
    For real though is there any challenge to the game at all? I don’t mind if there isn’t, it looks like it’s supposed to be a chill exploration game with some moments of running away
        There’s some little puzzles here and there but nothing difficult. You mainly just explore with a few parts where you have to run from enemies
            .. and a little bit of "combat" where you shine a light on enemies to kill them and manage the little cooldown it has.

There's also a Metal Cat Solid stealth section later on.
    Yeah after about 2 hours in and hitting the sewers I was like... Caelid? Is this Caelid? Lol
Those sewers wigged me out so bad.
    THE GIANT EYES!!
        Me: Is this Resident Evil?
            Right?? I was NOT expecting that
        It's amazing how off guard it catches you. I remember getting low key jump scared when I noticed them.
        My take away from the gameplay is that every jump is scripted. Is this the case? Like you approach a ledge, hit a button, then there's an animation for a jump.

I was expecting a free-roaming platformer where you have a little more freedom.
            You can more or less choose the angle of the jump, and most elevated platforms can be jumped on top of.
So that's Nyanners?
    No, it's not a worm.
I love meowing at cameras
    I love meowing ~~at cameras~~
        I ~~love~~ meow~~ing at cameras~~
            ~~I love~~ meow~~ing at cameras~~
                ***meow***
    meowing at the guys tossing paint cans long enough to distract them into dropping them
How does it compare to Cyberpunk 2077, though?  Better, or worse, in your book?  Just curious, really
    It's not the same thing at all... Stray is more directed and of a smaller scope. Love it so far.
        They’re not the same but in terms of the overall world-building, lore, design etc. Stray has a much better and more interesting cyberpunk world.
    They are completely different types of games and it's unfair to compare them. Stray has a much, much smaller scope, there is no combat, and it has a bigger focus on puzzles. Also, Stray isn't an RPG, its a linear adventure game.
    Can't compare the two to be honest.

I'd compare Stray to like.... Shadow of the Colossus. Linear on rails sort of experience. Literally nothing to compare when against cyberpunk.

That or like The Quarry or Until Dawn and such. It's more an interactive movie than it is a "game" if that makes sense. My gf is absolutely loving it and I love to watch her enjoy that. Me myself? I'd rather play Elden Ring or Returnal.
    Well, only one game let's you shred the carpet, knock shit out the shelves, mlem and has a dedicated meow button.
I love just being a little $&@+

I scratched up the rugs and walls 

There’s a robot that you can sleep on top of also
Amazing game. Definitely took an unexpected tone in some parts, >!I am specifically talking about the room make of eyes and eldritch horrors.!< Not that that's bad, just... I was not ready for that in what I thought was a silly cat game.
    [deleted]
        Yes, this is a real thing

Didn't realise wholesome cat game was also >!a psychological horror!<
            Isn't the premise that you are a cat lost from the family so essentially you see the world as a lost house cat would? Cats get scared and frightened easily.
                That's not what's going on in the game. It's a dystopia world that has eldritch monsters in it.
    Does any cat get hurt / die during this game? I kind of don't want to play it if this is the case
        Yes but it's not graphic at all and is very brief. I hate seeing cats and dogs die in video games and this games death sequences never really bothered me.
        the cat gets hurt in the beginning during the fall and the limp is realistic enough to hurt your heart, but she licks her leg after a few seconds and is ok. other than that the death sequences are brief and non graphic, the screen just kinda goes red and you go back to your last checkpoint without seeing the cat actually die. not bad at all imo
If meditation was a game
    Idk man having the zurks chase me around gives me way more anxiety than it should
        I had to take a break because I kept dying to them and felt really depressed lol
            My gf really wants to get it but really doesn’t want to see a cat die graphically. Is it like that or a bit more gentle?
                It's really not that bad, they stick to you and then you fall over pretty much. There's no blood or anything. I'm just a huge cat lover and it bothered me to begin with lol
                    She’s also a huge cat lover, that’s why she was concerned haha. Good to know she can get into it now!
        Shit chasing me in games always gets me.
    That's basically what Abzu is
can't wait to get my paws on this game
    What "tier" of Playstation Plus membership is required to get this game? I'm very much interested in it, but the tier system that Playstation has released feels like a money grab.
        Otherwise its only 30 bucks. I have the premium ps plus and I'm still going to buy it. I like having my game library unlinked to an active subscription.
            And you're also supporting the studio behind a game you've enjoyed.

Bless you. I'll be doing the same.
        I think it’s the higher 2 tiers
        It's on the "extra" tier. But, it's like 40 to upgrade to it and Stray is only 30.
        None is you pay 30 euros
        I've just left mine on the basic bronze level for now. If I want a game I'll pay for it.
Hour into it and it's fun and my cats seem to enjoy it...alittle too much, get your fluffy butts away from the screen
    Our cat tried to play with the virtual kitty.
    My take away from the gameplay is that every jump is scripted. Is this the case? Like you approach a ledge, hit a button, then there's an animation for a jump.

I was expecting a free-roaming platformer where you have a little more freedom.
        Yes, it is. The animations are beautiful, but the controls feel a bit limiting. You can meow as much as you want if that helps.
            Can I bark?
                [removed]
                    I did find a receipt for a joke toilet
                        Has that ever happened to you?!
                            Call me right now please!
                        It's just for farts
                I feel like most people can bark. It's not hard to do. A lot of kids do it when they are playing around.
                It's a 20 dollar dlc.
            If they made it so you had to do the jumps yourself quite a few parts would turn into a jump king cat dlc
            hmmm, yeah. I think I'll pass. I was hoping it would be more like feline witcher3, but its more like feline tomb raider I guess.
                It's more of a puzzle game and less of an open world game. It's entertaining. I'm a couple hours in.
            Disagree with the "beautiful" animations but otherwise a fun game
        Pro tip: After you have played for 30-45 min or so (and probably earlier if you are ok fiddling around), you can turn off the jump markers in the settings with few problems moving forward. 

This makes it feel much more organic and immersive, like you are prompting a real cat to jump who will only do so when they think it is worth it to jump & knows that they can make the jump, rather than just artificially interacting with button prompts. 

It works really well like this IMO because the jump points are (with a few exceptions) very intuitive. So much so that I wish the devs had put in a pop-up early in the game encouraging players to try it out this way.
            I don't know man, I'm almost done with it and there were a few times where I got really frustrated that I couldn't jump on thing that I should've been able to. Particularly behind the night club. Plenty of stuff I should be able to jump on get up there but only one path the game let's you take.
                Sounds like there ought to be a hotkey that highlights jump points for a few seconds
                I can see that for sure. I added a caveat to the last paragraph. My main point wasn’t about whether the traversal system was perfect, but about how the jump markers themselves don’t really make the game any better/easier and can probably be turned off.
                    Yeah I got you, I just feel like I needed those jump markers at a couple spots. Either way, getting confused about where I could jump was rare and didn't ruin the game. Most of the time it was intuitive. I had the day off and got it for free with ps+ and it's been really fun. I would've been totally fine paying for the game.
        Yeah. It's kind of annoying. There are dumpsters that you can't jump on right next to dumpsters that look exactly alike but you can jump on, for example.
        This is true. You also can't jump any time either. Idk why but for games that bothers me. I just want to Assassins Creed every possible surface! Lol
        It's very much not a platformer, closer to a puzzle game.

            Cat.
                Cat.
                    [removed]
                        Cat.
            When I noticed I clicked on "publisher" and noticed I own about 50% of anything they ever published.

All of those games are very focused. Not sure if I would call that style "simple". Stray is incredibly focused. You play as a cat and they went to 100% cat movement for that. And that is the vehicle by which you explore this very interesting world.
            Neon White is also Annapurna, they aren't all walking simulators, so I disagree with the premise here.
        The story is very linear. The puzzles are as simple as they could possibly be. The majority of the gameplay feels like a point-and-click adventure in 3d. Small sections require you to run from rats, kinda like a watered down version of A Plague Tale.

I was hoping for a game where I could role play as a cat around a city, but this isn't really it.
            Keep in mind it was developed by a small studio. Considering their resources, I think its beyond my own expectations. The puzzles are pretty simple, but I kind of like it.
            Yeah same, I was imagining an open world city that you roam around in with free style movement. Meet quirky side characters or even just meet other cats that you do some stuff for. Would love to see that kind of thing
    [deleted]
        I'm about 3 hours in, it's a bit linear, but also offers exploration. In terms of difficulty/challenge, it isn't a difficult game. And the puzzles aren't 'hard'. If you're looking for a challenge in this game, I do not think it's your type of game.
            Are the puzzles easier than Untitled Goose Game?
                I haven't played Untitled Goose Game, but the puzzles in Stray are quite straight forward. If in a small space, there are only a handful of options it could be at. In a bigger space, there are quite some "obvious" hints.
                Yes. I played both and untitled goose game is more puzzles less story. Stray is far prettier and really sucks you into the world.
                Yes they are
                Yes. By a fair margin, too.
            Eh, exploration isn't really rewarded much in this game.
        It feels like I'm playing little nightmares 2 again and it's actually fun even if their isn't a ton of challenges
            I had a similar thought, mine being "I like this even more because there are some more open areas to explore around in and do some optional quest challenge things"

I love it
        Only about an hour in myself but there are puzzles to solve to get through the world.
            I'm like 4 hours in and I haven't found a puzzle that was actually interesting yet. They all have been incredibly simple and took no effort to solve, which isn't really rewarding.
                I love the art and the gameplay itself but man this game is incredibly easy. . I really like it but I honestly think a 19.99 price point is a bit more fair
        Skillup has a good Review on it.
    That's my issue right now actually.  My car won't leave the screen alone
I'm OOTL can someone explain why I'm seeing this everywhere
    [Because it's a game that just came out today](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/game-review-stray-redefines-the-adventure-genre-with-a-cats-eye-view/).
    It's a video game, with a cat and youre on the internet. Get ready to see it everywhere lol
        >It's a video game, with a cat

and ray tracing!

Edit: I thought I saw ray tracing in a gameplay preview...maybe I'm misremembering.
    Reddit loves cats and indie games.
    Fun linear adventure game, where you play as a regular ol cat.
        This is a pretty smart fucking cat.  Nothing regular about him.
    We've been waiting for this game for something like 6 years now from the first sneak peek. And it just came out today.
    Meow
    It's called marketing
        Not really. It's literally good looking game about cat. That was it. Thats the extent of the marketing. That was enough for everyone else to market it for them. For what it is it's great, would I pay $40 for it? Nah. But it was first day to playstations version of gamepass so wtf do I care. 

Good game. Could it be more? Sure. So can everything.
            I didn't imply it wasn't a good game or that regular people weren't sharing posts about it. Someone asked why they were seeing it everywhere and I gave them the answer.
                I know. I just don't see this as really the effects of a terrific marketing team or anything like that. Just a byproduct of the internets love for cats.
                    Marketing 101: *Include a cat*

Profit.
                        100%. Friends have been saying how their non gamer gf wants this game. 

You can never underestimate the power of the cat. And if you do, they will pounce on you and ruin your electronics because the stupid little bastard can't stop chewing on wires and....

.... Anyways yes, the answer is cats.
    Effective viral marketing and it had a successful teaser post get popular on this subreddit a month or two ago.
        Dude it was in the original ps5 games announcement
        This game was originally shown on reddit like, 5+ years ago. One of those "I'm making my first game and here's the first clip" deals." It was pretty organic afaik. This game has been looked forward to by a lot of people for a long time.
            The first I heard of it was that big post a month or two ago. That explains things a bit!
[deleted]
    Was watching a friend play it on twitch, i think they spent 4 hours just pushing objects off of ledges and giggling about it.
        This is why I haven't finished the game yet. I've spent a lot of time wandering and pushing stuff off ledges. Also trying to find all the collectibles and memories. I will have to go back to one chapter Cuse I went to the next area, not realizing I was
    30$ for a 4 hour game really detracts from my desire to purchase it. Guess I'll wait until it goes on sale.
    Haven't played it but watched a review and 2 things cooled my enthusiasm for it:  
1. There is no actual jump button. If you position the cat in a direction it can jump, it will say press x or whatever and the game completes the jump for you. This would take away from the fluidity of the immersion for me.  
2. The reviewer said he beat the game in 5 hours. That's like indie game short. For something that's been this hyped up I would have expected at least 8 hours of gameplay.
        > That's like indie game short.

...its an indie game
        Point 1 makes it a no buy for me. I haven't been able to get into a single game that breaks up the regular gameplay with button prompts in that way.
            You can turn the jump prompts off. It's pretty easy to tell what you can and can't jump on.
    Overhyped for a $30 game?  

That seems harsh.   Had I paid $69.99 for it, it'd be upset.   For what it is on initial play through, and going back for trophies..

7 hours on my first play through, got about 45% of the trophies blind.   Talked to damn near every character in the game.   

$30 sits just fine for me.   

It's a pretty, indie, cat game, with some weird Sci-Fi elements...

No complaints.
Yes. Thank you. I added this to my Steam wishlist the minute I saw the gameplay video. Such an amazing concept. Very creative.

Oddly enough, Stray seemed to be an experience where I knew anything I imagined, no matter how cool, wouldn't come close to the actually finished product. I have high hopes for this one!
    Not that this game isn't good, but you might want to temper your expectations. Really just an idea for life in general...
        I have a 5 year old and an 8 year old. My little guy loves cats, but doesn't seem like a little kid game. You think he is too young?
            If you play with them (AKA  on the couch with them, on your phone while they play) it should be alright as there are some chase sequences that may be scary for a young child.


Other than that the main 'slums' area is basically a big playground if you aren't trying to solve puzzles or do quests.  Letting them play there would be fine.
                Thanks for the info, I appreciate it!
            I'm halfway through the game, and there are a few chase scenes where you get swarmed by robotic insects. Some people might find that uncomfortable, especially children. I think it's pretty family friendly, though. If you get hit by a bug, it's not graphic, they just latch onto you. The cat can die if there are enough insects on you, but the screen just gets redder then fades to black. It's also obvious when you are in a dangerous area, and most of the game you are in a safe area, so you can take over the controller to handle the dangerous parts if your kids get too scared. Also, some of the robots are implied to curse, but it's censored ******.
It's really good so far.

Flower and journey.
    Holy shit I haven't played Flower in like a decade. I loved that game.
        I wish I could just enjoy Flower but I'm so bad at controlling the wind it ends up being a frustrating experience for me. I know it's 100% my fault. The setting is beautiful.
            Can’t you adjust the sensitivity on that? Or have you and it still frustrates you?
    Journey is one of my favourite games ever. The ending feels like what I imagine dying and going to heaven is like. I've played it multiple times just to experience that ending again.
        I was tripping while playing journey the first time and it all made so much sense to me in that mindset. You’re going through life, some parts of it are really fun and easy like the sand sliding level. Some parts are hard and scary like the parts where the metal whales are chasing you. People come into your journey randomly and some stay for just a little while, some of them stay with you through several chapters of your life, even to the end. Climbing the final mountain with a companion you had for a majority of the game was actually emotional. Then the rebirth and ascension to the top of the mountain, only to slowly walk into the light together again. Unbelievable game
    Abzu as well. Flow is a neat one too.
    Journey is soooooooooooo good. Played that for the very first time ever while on some mushrooms and it was so beautiful
Abzu

Edit: also Sable. I haven't checked it out myself yet but wishlisted for later
    Abzu is very good
    Like the other person said, Sable is freaking *gorgeous.* It's got decently fun yet simple gameplay to it as well.
    Sable is amazing. A bit buggy but so beautiful
    im playing sable on the side right now. such a chill game
    Sable is beautiful. I just wish the “call bike” function actually worked. The Japanese Breakfast soundtrack makes up for it though.
    Abzu is great on acid.
        I played through that whole game just on the other side of a peak from 4 tabs.

Legit had tears during that last sequence with the music and colors and all. 

Absolutely incredible game. 10/10. 20/10 on acid.
Little kitty big city is an upcoming indie game where you play as a cat, has lots in common
    >Little kitty big city

That looks so adorable...
Little Nightmares
    [deleted]
        I think that it has enough similarities that people who enjoy Stray would also like Little Nightmares. 

Both rely on the player solving puzzles to get through obstacles, strange & unsettling background settings, simple gameplay that doesn’t require much focus, short gameplay, ambient soundtrack, and both games follow the main character on a journey.
I got a similar feeling from Firewatch. Exploratory and ambiance.
Cloudpunk sorta. It’s a softer, sometimes lighthearted voxel-styled cyberpunk game.

Selling point is being a relaxing hovercar drive around game.

Similar chill vibe.
    Cloudpunk is a really chill game...until it isn't.
Tokyo Jungle
    As in you play as an animal, sure... anything else, no, not really.
    Possibly the most underrated game of all time. I spent so much time unlocking all those damn animals.
Lost Ember
I've gotta second Flower as far as the chill vibe, though it doesn't have the intellectual depth that Stray has (dealing with hard subjects like poverty, human greed, etc...) Flower is literally just drifting in a field as a gust of wind and hitting all the flowers until the field lights up and brings you to the next little maze. 

As far as the theme goes, Detroit Become Human has that futuristic wasteland/ AI-taking-over type of vibe and it's got a really good message to it too. Plus you can make choices throughout the game, giving you different outcomes based on what you choose.  If you haven't already played this one of course lol, I know it was pretty popular when it came out
It’s an older game, but prior to playing Stray it reminded me of Tokyo Jungle, the gameplay is not at all similar but wandering around a city as a small animal has its similarities.
Spirit of the North is similar not in world design, but in general concept; you play an animal and just get dropped into the world with no real idea what's actually going on, at the beginning.  And as you progress you learn more and more about the environment.
The closest thing is Machinarium honestly
>!That’s the only thing that kinda disappointed me but I also would’ve cried!<
I’m hoping we get a sequel or DLC where that happens
    I think we will with the little tease at the end
    It was a mass success for BlueTwelve studios. I'm really hoping for a sequel, seems likely with the semi-open ending and the positive feedback. I'd love a sequel!
For real, I went through the whole game like “yeah, gonna reunite you with your buddies” And then B12 dies and I can’t pick him up and take him with me in hopes of finding someone to repair him. And then the door opens and I think “this is it, even closer to finding my pals.” Nope. Fuck me. Overall loved the game though.
Possibly my favorite game of all time is called Inside. It's a simple left-to-right puzzle platformer of sorts with an intense moody atmosphere and mysterious/eerie setting. Not too long, but definitely worth multiple playthroughs. And the sound design is absolutely on point. I'd highly recommend it, especially since it's not too long.
    Got it on sale last year and it was great. I'm assuming you've played Limbo as well?
    Thanks. Inside has a trial and is currently 75% off.
        It's coming to Game Pass as well.
    Inside was great. Made by the same people who made Limbo I believe, which is also really good.
    That game was cool. Little easy and short but really cool atmosphere.

Gameplay reminds me quite a bit of some older (but more challenging) games like Prince or Persia, Another World, and Flashback.

Blackthorn is another rad old game that’s similar, but with a shotgun!
        Yooo, Blackthorn was one of the first games I played on my garage sale homemade pc back in the late 90s. A Blizzard classic.
            Hey I was playing the shareware version back then too, windows 3.1 machine with a whopping 25 MHz cpu. 😂

I have the snes rom and still go back and play it every couple years or so. Still fun.
                I loved blackthorn too!!
    I have a feeling you don't know Limbo. If you don't, you'll love it. I've played inside once. I've played Limbo about 6 times already and I don't replay games. Like at all. (It's from the same studio, their previous game, absolute masterpiece).
        So I had the misfortune of playing Limbo *after* I played Inside. It's hard for me to want to go back to Limbo knowing I could replay Inside instead. Something about Inside resonated more with me than Limbo, even though it's a great game in its own right. 

I also have to admit I think Inside is the better game. Visually, game-play, and sound design just hits more. Seems like the studio took what they learned from Limbo and applied it to Inside.
            Interesting, I would argue the opposite :D. Inside is a larger project, but I've loved the journey in Limbo. It's a journey through life and while I wouldn't form that idea on my own, I've surely felt it while playing:

The boy died in the forest and awakens in limbo (the world between life and death). The soul can only get out of limbo when the body is properly buried. The boy continues through limbo until his sister finds and buries his body. In the ending scene, she is covering his grave.

Also, the whole journey is like a journey through life. Fear of spiders and water is overcome only to be replaced of the fear of bullying, character goes from forests to work environment and so on and so forth.

Anyways, the point is, I love Limbo because of that artistic overarching vision that guided the project. I was surprised that I didn't have that feeling with Inside.
    Yep. I mean, folks can enjoy whatever they like and I don't mind if people prefer longer games. That's totally cool. But the crowd who totally dismiss shorter games and accuse devs of being lazy or whatever... they're missing the point by a country mile. Games like Inside are examples of shorter, beautifully-crafted experiences. I'm not suggesting that folks have to like them - to each their own - but it's the dismissal and naysaying that annoys me.
        Agreed. Why dismiss these shorter games? What have you got to lose? I'd happily play an engaging several hour experience rather than the same multiplayer shoot-loot-shoot-loop on repeat. But you're right: everyone has the right to their own preferences.
    Inside is awesome
    So you ever heard of this game called… Little Nightmares
I enjoy my big AAA 60 hour open worlds, but a nice short little game like this with great polish and atmosphere makes for a superb pallet cleanser
I prefer short games now. I don't have the time to play long games. It's reached the point where if a game is supposed to be a huge, sprawling experience it kinda pushes me away from trying it.

I work constantly all week and maybe have 3-4 hours to play a game every couple weeks. I can't play all these 100+ hour games like I could in high school and college.
    Yep, that’s me with Red Dead. 

The grind of a massive map, doing tiny little tasks. I enjoy the idea of it, but then I actually get into it and… aaaa
    I love strategy games and I always struggle with this. I’ll have a free weekend and just dump hours into an EU4 game. Then a month later when I have time, I load it up like ‘wtf was I even doing?’ and start a new game.
[deleted]
Majority of Reddit is a bunch of entitled kids who want to only see things they like and anything else is garbage. I’m insanely excited to play this game and everything about it is up my alley
My ideal length for games is 20 to 30 hours. I’ll happily play shorter games but not longer games. 

Games I have enjoyed:
- The Pathless

- The Last of Us

- Spider-Man 2018


Games I will play:
- TLOU2 

- Spider-Man MM

- Stray (started yesterday)

- Firewatch

Games that are too big for me 
- AC: Valhalla

- RDR2

- Cyberpunk


I’d happily take suggestions on unique, beautiful, fun up to 30 hour games.
    If you don't lock yourself up in a bunch of side quests you can beat cyberpunk in around 20 hours

It's on Spotify
Saw it on steam today
It would have been nice if it were a little longer as long as the gameplay was more varried

I would have hated if they extended the pop-a-bug section.
There's an achievement for doing the whole game in under two hours. I'll give it a go now I've played through it once. It'll be an interesting challenge.
    Yeah, it's pretty easy you can do it in around one and a half hours so there is a lot of time to spare
How many hours did it take you?
    Around 5 first time and 1,5 while doing it for the second time for trophy
        Wow, wasn’t expecting it to be THAT short. Stray has been my most anticipated GOTY so it’s a bit disappointing to hear that it’s not longer but I’m sure it’s jam packed with great content! Would rather it be shorter and really well done than long where everything seems like it’s dragging on.
Can't wait to play it. I think of games like this (Journey, Abzu) kind of like a movie experience. I usually spend around $30 at AMC for a ticket and popcorn, and if I really like the movie I'll watch it multiple times (at home or sometimes even again in the theater) and catch new things the second watch through.

What button do you press to drag your butt across the freshly cleaned carpet?

What about leaving a pile of slimy unchewed food?
    Anyone got the “bring in a dead bird and leave it next to the bed” collectable?
        No sorry only the bring in an almost dead bird that starts flapping around like crazy as soon as the cat lets go causing chaos and a lot of stress collectable
    you CAN scratch up carpets and the occasional wall.
        So are there a lot of vertical climbing surfaces?  Or is it just curtains?  Never played it… but my cats insist curtains are made for just that.
            I’ve come across one curtain to scratch up so far
Also can you just paw things off a dresser or counter just to be an asshole? Wouldn’t be a cat game without that.
    That's actually the way you solve some of the puzzles.

    Yes...  I literally knocked every paint can, bottle, coffee cup off every ledge I could while playing through.
    Yes. Repeatedly
Hopefully you can chew on a plant and then throw it up a couple minutes later as well. I’ll refund if I can’t.
    I feel this.  My cat eats every stupid ass thing.
My cats do that in real life.
    So do mine
You can’t even jump in it. It’s a huge letdown for me
Motion blur is often a culprit that causes that. See if you can disable it
    Motion sickness is always the first thing I turn off.

        Did people downvote this comment for some reason or does reddit just like hiding comments for having just a small amount of upvotes?
            I was thinking the same thing.  Comment was hidden, but didn't say it was below the score threshold.  Was assuming it was someone saying "ACKSHUALLY...".  But no...regular ol' comment.
                I saw it okay among all the comments in the thread (BaconReader on mobile)
Sitting in a cardboard box will help keep you oriented. Make sure it's the smallest one you can fit in so your body is making 4 points of constant contact.
    So I need to become an actual cat, got it.
        Make sure to knock things off of shelves and tables too.
    Don't close the box though, or no one will know if you're alive or not.
    Is this serious? If it is...
Aside from motion blur as others have mentioned, excessive monitor brightness can cause it in some cases. As well as too wide FoV if you're playing on PC on an ultrawide.
Me too. Turned motion blur off like I do for every game, but started feeling sick after about 30 minutes.
Turn off motion blur. It's literally used to disguise framerate drops. I turn it off in every game. Just the stupidest "feature" ever.
    Why this homie getting down voted he is dead ass right.
    I actually like motion blur. I know that sacrilegious to say but I don't care. I understand that it can be implemented to hide frame drops but I still like it. I don't think that it's bad just because it has a purpose other than it's surface value. 

I'll keep it on, even when my 3080 is pushing solid 120+ frames.
        [Removing all my posts and comments due to Reddit's fuckery with third party apps. June 2023]
I'm having the same issue, which is pretty usual for me sadly. If they'd add a FOV slider or something similar, that would help a lot.
    There’s no fov slider? 


Aaannnnnd I’m not buying it till there’s a mod to fix that.

Edit: downvote me if you want. I like cats too, but we need to have standards. It’s ridiculous not to have an fov slider in 2022.
        Not sure why this is so downvoted. I can understand not everyone caring about fov sliders but as stated here it is important for some people. And tbh in 2022 tthey should be almost standard across the board considering how many years people have been complaining about a lack of fov sliders in games.
        TotalBiscuit's spirit lives on. There is zero reason a game shouldn't have options for every effect the game has. Some games the effects don't bother me and others they are obnoxious.
        I agree with you. Fov slider should be in every game by default. I was thinking buying this but if theres no fov option i wont. Im one of those people who get motion sickness when fov is too low cant play games with low fov. I will upvote you if it helps.
Welcome to my life. Can I ask you about some others? The last of us? The Witcher 3? V rising? 

Also if you can turn the FOV up on anything that helps tremendously
Check the fov and see if it can be changed. That always gives me motion sickness.
Its not motion blur. You have no frame of reference where you're looking. Turn the pointer thingy on. Makes it Purrfect
Turn on the crosshair and focus on it during gameplay.
Oh no! I get motion sickness really easy so this worries me
    I get major, major motion sickness (even riding in the passenger side of a car in the front when someone else is driving makes me feel sick anymore, a common issue for people with migraines), and I felt fine after turning off motion blur and capping the FPS
My favorite spot to sleep is >!Clementine's Flat!<
    I love that spot too. So cozy ☺️
wow what a game
Just to make sure you are on safe side. Make sure your computer can run this game. I bought this game since I was visiting family, and my older PC which is like 6 years old couldn't run this game. A lot of people are having trouble with the game off Steam. 

Apparently something with PS5 exclusive allowed people to get the game for free.
its not supposed to be an open world nor a challenging game if thats what your expectations were
I thought A Short Hike and Obra Dinn were incredible art-wise but I don’t think they appeal to everyone.
I had to pause and take a minute to regain emotional stability after the dreaded fall at the beginning of the game.. Still upsets me just thinking about it.

Losing your cat is one of the most painful experiences in the world. I am sorry to hear that you had to say goodbye, and I hope that you find peace, comfort, and joy in remembering the love you shared with her. <3
    Yeah the fall had me go "oh no nononono NO". The murrs of panic and pain had me teary eyed.
I love the linearity. Whenever i play a nonlinear game i feel like i have to discover everything and do every side mission or i will miss out
You can play it for free. New playstation account plus the PS+ Extra 7 day trial.
Is the game only five hours long?
    I explored a fair amount, and I got about 6 hours of game play. Which isn't a bad thing. I think if the game were longer it might have felt a tiny bit dragged out. 

I think it's really worth the price. The movement, music, and world building were all great. It's been a long time since I've played a game that's just it's own thing. Nothing complicated, no in depth mechanics. The game is what it says it is and honestly it was an incredibly refreshing experience. Perfect game for a "non-gamer" too, if you're trying to get one of your loved ones into the hobby. 

That said, I absolutely love cats so my bias may be speaking a bit here.
        Makes me hopeful for a sequel, or even better, and more lengthy storyline. It wouldn’t even necessarily need to change the formula or assets up. Just more of what it’s already doing.
    Depends on how much you explore and how much of the backstory/collectables you are hunting.  

There is an achievement for finishing it in under two hours, but I'm looking at an easy 8-10.
        Ah, so it's the length of 1 run through a Dwemer ruins.
            its infinitely more fun though
    I finished the game in a single playthrough, being curious and talking to everyone, rubbing against legs and everything.  

7 hours of gameplay beginning to end.   

Netting about 45% of the trophies blind.
    My son just finished it today, it's not that long
    I've played 8 and I'm at 40 something percent, so not necessarily. I've also missed some of the collectibles. 

If you are only doing the story and not looking around at all, then maybe, but even the first level is large and complex enough imo that it'd probably be difficult unless you've played it and are going for the achievement.

I bought it before it came out and I really don't regret the price.
    I'm currently at 6 hours, trying to get all of the achievements, and I've only reached the mid-to-end portion of the game. However, I did spend around an hour of my time just  exploring, appreciating, and casually messing around as an adorable kitty.. It's definitely something I never realized I wanted to so badly in a video game! XD
I mean if you just run through the story, sure. It took me like 3.5 hours to go through the first little town. If you just enjoy the world and being there it adds so much

But either way 25 seems like a fine price for what I got
6 hrs of story gameplay. You can do whatever the heck you want along that way, so I don't see the problem, the point of this game is to simulate the cat life. But if you only play game to finish them then I don't think any of these type of game would worth it for you.
I don’t get how people have the correlation that length of game = price of game. Should shorter movies cost less and longer cost more? Dont they both have the same level of effort and craft (to a degree/depending)?
    Movies typically have a much shorter range of runtimes. And much shorter run times overall. 75 minutes minimum to what, 150, 180 max. The significant value metric isnt quantity here.

But games can go from 2 hours to 100+ in some cases. This spread is enough that most people would pay significantly more for a long game with the same quality as a short one. Time spent becomes a significant metric, because quality being equal, I'm getting much more value out of a longer game. With such a long spread in playtimes, significantly more development effort is also spent on longer games than shorter ones.

That's not to say time is the only metric, of course.
    Yup. Even still if you get enjoyment out of it you're paying $5.00/hr to have fun.
    As someone who games 40+ hours a week, I can't afford to be dropping $30 on something I can knock out in a few hours. Bigger and longer doesn't necessarily mean better, but I have played plenty of excellent games (including some masterpieces) that I was able to sink 100+ hours into at a cheaper price than this game. If it ever drops to $10 I'll give it a whirl.
That’s the price of a meal you eat in 15 minutes.
    25$ can feed you for a week in some places
Only 5 hours? Wtf?
    It's a game about being a cat, not sure what you expected lol. This isn't going to be some Mass Effect level of story.
        It’s actually funny, there’s quite a bit of interesting story being presented and I was just running after a ball, pawing at it while they were talking about it. 

It’s very much a cat simulator lol
    What exactly did you expect?
Yeah I’m no hater, I’d like to play this because it seems like a pretty good game. But no way is it $30 USD good, not for 5 hours of gameplay
    If you want to buy the game just grab the PlayStation version of gamepass. Half the price ($40 vs $21 here in Canada) and you can play it and all kinds of other shit. 

Literally why it was a day one service game was to motivate people towards this. Just cancel before your month is up. Don't allow auto renew.
pspspspspspspsp
Have you put the paper bag over your head yet? Controls become reversed!
yeah I see alota people complaining about it being overpriced for a 5 hour walking sim. But the allure of the game is the ambiance and being emersed in the beautiful world. If you wanted some complex long gaming experience. Prob should just play a different game as thats not the intended experience.
What they call walking sim I call adventure game. Find the thing that makes other things do things. But instead of pointing and clicking you're a cat with very satisfying movement in an amazingly rendered world.

People are losers
    Totally. Cats are way better
That's maybe not much for you but for people that are working min wage (10.79 euro ish here)  it is
    That’s not the problem of the game developer. That’s the problem of the customer. The game is “half a game” according to the playtime argument, and it’s half the price of a standard PS5 game.
Yeah I find it absurd the amount of people who focus on price to length ratio. Sure that’s fine if it was less than an hour long or something but buying lunch or a movie ticket “can” be around the price of the game and yet no one complains about spending 20+ concessions to see Thor in imax but oh no this price is stupid. If the game doesn’t interest for the price it’s at now then just wait cause there’s plenty of people who think the price is exactly what it should be. There’s just something so entitled about complaining about something like this. If you only have a certain amount to spend and you want something that’ll last you longer that’s understandable but don’t get mad at the game.
Meow meow
You definitely can miss them, and you'll have to replay as there doesn't seem to be a ng+.
There is a chapter select after you finish the game so technically nothing is missable. It will tell you how many memories in each chapter you have out of how many there are so you know how many you’re missing. Just make sure that when you do this, that you collect a memory and then continue playing until there is a cutscene or save icon, otherwise it might not register (if you quit the chapter right away).
    thank you so much!

you're a bot
    No YOU'RE a towel.
I really like the slow pace and the atmosphere. I can see how it wouldn’t be everyone’s bag though.
Death Stranding broke you. 😂
    lol, yeah, I couldn't even finish Death Stranding. I kept waiting for it to be fun, couple hours in I gave up.
        Feel your pain. I did the same, but for RDR2.
    Death Stranding broke me too lmao. I stopped playing a little over halfway through. great graphics and music. cool backstory. but just got tried of making sam walk, esp when I was carrying heavy things for transport. ugh :(
Its a first game by a small studio, after their successes i imagine their next game would be far bigger.
It does


I would like more fur though
    As a prior cat owner, no you wouldn't. 

Oh you meant in game.
    That and I wish I could control the jump instead of jumping where it tells me
Nooooo the cat can die and it's horrible and traumatic
Its easy to respawn but omg the first time it happened? Forget it. I cried and I'm in my 40s
[deleted]
    I didn't even realize I'd missed a joke, until I got this far..
Its the sound you make when you want to get a cats attention.
The hype is literally that you are a cat. People love cats.  What's not to like?

But what it actually comes down to is a beautiful game with well thought out gameplay and a clever story.  Plus you're a cat and can push things off shelves.
But tech demo sell very well on ps5
Many cats don't respond.
    They always respond to German.

> I was expecting some kinda skyrim levels of free exploration

Expecting an indie walking simulator to equal a AAA production heavily focused on exploration is not as reasonable as you may believe.
    Imagine paying $30 for a 4 hour walking simulator.
        You're right people paid 60 for Death Stranding to deliver Amazon packages.
        I've paid close to that for one meal, and more than half of that to see a movie. I'm not interested in this specific walking simulator, but I'm also not opposed to the idea in principle.
            Look at mister money bags over here
        This is what happens when you are raised on mobile and free to play games.
        Four hours in and no regrets.  I've spent more on visual novels.  Different strokes for different folks but this is a charming game. 

It's also not purely a walking sim. There's puzzles etc
        $30 dollars is nothing for a decent game. Get a better job
            I can't get a better job. Can you gift me a copy since it's nothing to you?
        I pay more than that to see a 1.5 hour movie at the cinemas, haha. So $30 for a beautiful, contained experience is no problem at all.
            I just upgraded the rest of my ps+ subscription for $15. So I can play Stray and whatever else on the list that I want to for the next 5 months
    Lmao people are allowed to dislike something you like Jesus. Just because it's indie doesn't mean people can't dislike it because it wasn't what they were looking for.
        I never said they weren't allowed to dislike it, and since I haven't played the game I don't like or dislike it myself. What I tried to say was that their expectations were just ridiculous. It's like buying Bloodborne and being disappointed that the map size can't rival Ubisoft open-worlds.
Honestly I expected the game to be much more like a ww2 simulator. There arent any tanks. There arent any air planes. Not even so much as a m1 Garand. You cant shoot enemies. You cant even storm the beaches of Normandy. It's just so simple and empty.
    I heard there's a Grumman F6F Hellcat.
        Ok I will keep looking for sure
    Honestly I expected the game to be much more like a Star Wars simulator. There arent any AT-ATs. There arent any TIE Fighters. Not even so much as an E-Web. You cant set blasters to stun. You cant even have the high ground. It's just so simple and empty.
        Honestly I expected the game to be much more like a Tenchu 3: Wrath of Heaven remake. There arent any katanas. There arent any grappling hooks. Not even so much as some rice. You cant kill for Lord Gohda. You cant even be a ninja. It's just so simple and empty.
    It's about a "cat" not a "gat", I can see the confusion though.
I thought this was a copypasta and the Skyrim comparison was gonna keep going
Wow. All these incredibly enthusiastic posts with nothing but rave reviews are suddenly seeming so disingenuous.  
    
Can't jump in a cat game? What a joke.
    The jumping system they have now makes it much more realistic to how a cat would actually traverse. It's not a 3D mario platformer, or a survival cat RPG, it's an adventure game where you play as a cat.
        Yes.

When my cat is wearing her backpack and solving puzzles around the house, I noticed she only jumps when a prompt come up.

100% realism confirmed.
        So wait, you CAN jump?  Cause the person I replied said there's no jumping at all.
            My understanding is that jumping is a context button.

In other words, you can only jump when and where the game lets you.
                It feels like the Zipline and ledge grabbing in the Arkham games.
                You can jump onto most surfaces and platforms, its not a restrictive as you are making it seem
            What they meant was you can't just jump whenever you want. Stand next to ledge or a gap and a button prompt will appear on screen. Press the button and the cat does a jump to where the prompt was. 

I didn't buy the game but I agree with them it looks very limiting. Sure the way they've done it the animations look smooth and very realistic but I personally enjoy my freedom to hop around like an idiot in other games.
                Whenever you find yourself asking "Hey, it looks like I should be able to jump there, can I jump there?", the VAST majority of the time the answer is going to be yes. 

Jumping is a fundamental part of the game. I often found myself jumping to places that didn't even lead to anything. So it's not as if the only jumps you can make are the ones on the story path.
                    I haven't played it. I'm waiting for actual reviews to come out instead of OMG CAT!!1! 

I'm glad you find it non limiting and open. Personally to me it looks very limited and I think the game probably just isn't for me. If you're enjoying it, more power to you.
            It's a canned animation. You push the button and it just does it for you. You don't aim it, you can't miss time it. That's probably what he means. It has jumping in the same way that one CoD game had respect paying. You push the button and the game plays itself. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing but a lot of people seemed to think this was gonna be a cat platformer.
            Technically yes, it's a big part of the game. It's odd but I think it fits very well with what the game is. I don't think a normal jumping system would fit with how the levels work.
    That's exactly what stopped me from buying it. I was ready to buy it on launch but I watched a review last night where the guy was trying to be enthusiastic but still mentioned the prompt based jumping and I was immediately turned off.
        This is sounding like a morbius situation, but I think people are doing it unironically, like they like the thought of a cat game and can't see any flaws with it. Is this game actually considered good or not?
            I'm throughly enjoying it and some of the "you  can't jump" comments are making me laugh cause it sounds like people expected cat parkour.

It's a linear story about a cat who is just chilling with their cat clan until they fall into a walled in city where all the humans are dead but robots remain.  

You find out what's going on by proceeding through the city. There's puzzles, memories and collectibles along the way. 

You can scratch things, meow your head off, trip a robot, rub against a robot,  break items etc. You have to not be nommed by half like looking bugs when you're not in robot city 

I'm four hours in and I'm throughly enjoying it so far cause I'm also looking for everything without a walk-through.

So, if you like that sort of thing then it's a good game for you. If not then no. But it's definitely a good game IMHO
            I think it's getting attention because it's different which is great. But from what I've gathered from other comments it's pretty and you can do a lot of cat stuff but except for specific circumstances it's pointless actions and it still feels lacking.
    Right? The viral marketing tactics for this game are insane. It doesn't even look interesting.
    The jumping system they have now makes it much more realistic to how a cat would actually traverse. It's not a 3D mario platformer, or a survival cat RPG, it's an adventure game where you play as a cat.
        Well it's also a video game about a cat solving puzzles. Kinda weird to think the jumping system is fine because it's realistic when the entire premise of the game is fantasy.
            They are still trying simulate a real cat protagonist. Without the odd claw durability system and hunger meter that others wanted.
    You are jumping all the time, but you can only jump if you have somewhere to jump TO. Cats don't just randomly bounce up and down (unless maybe playing with a ball). They walk or jog along, and the lithely jump to a specific ledge, or down, or whatever. You can jump loads, and really are jumping all the time, it is just a jump with deliberation.
I kind of wanted customization too, but to be fair I guess it's based off of an actual cat so they wanted it to look like him lol. still would have been cool to make him look like my cat though
    It sounds like people got their expectations way too high thinking this was supposed to be some big cat RPG when it's literally never been advertised as such so I'm not sure where all this confusion is coming from. It reminds me of people getting angry about lightyear because Tim Allen wasn't in it and they couldn't understand or fathom the possibility that a product could be different than how fans would imagine things to be due to hype or expectations that grow to a fever pitch so we end up disappointing ourselves all on our own (generally speaking)
        Lol true. I’m super happy with the game tbh. I played for hours yesterday and didn’t feel bored ever once.
You should have been expecting nothing so whatever you got is good then
This is great bait haha
I feel bad for anyone that actually believes this. Ngl tho you almost had me until you expected a Skyrim style rpg.
    Well, with how Reddit and other platforms have hyped it up, I'm not surprised he thought that. The hype for this game is unreal, this studio produces indie, linear gems like What Remains of Edith Finch, and this detail is lost when people describe and hype this game as the next huge thing, the game isn't trying to advertise itself as something so grand, it's own fanbase is doing that sadly.
    Have you played it? How is what he said wrong? Cause I’m playing it right now and it’s pretty boring
    Who says we're expecting a Skyrim style RPG? The point is it lacks basic features. You'd think you can free roam and jump around whereever in a game like this.
        The OP of the thread you're talking in said that.
I had a feeling this would be a giant shlock but god damn it exceeded my expectations in that department
[deleted]
I'm almost at the same point, asking for refund, so far it's very boring. And all the mechanics of the game/puzzles are meaningless and extremely guided. I feel like I'm just progressing a never ending cut scene.
Its a cat, how many times have you seen a cat randomly jumping arround.
Literally... Wtf does pspspspspspspsp mean?
    https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pspspsps

>Pspspsps is an onomatopoeia used to recreate the sound some make to get the attention of a cat. It has been used in a series of jokes about futile attempts to attract a cat.
    It's an onomatopoeia that you say to attract a cat.

perchance.
        You can’t just say perchance.
    It's the noise people make to get a cat's attention.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pspspsps
        Ahhh thank you!!! I've recently gotten into modding my PS Vita and so I've become aware of the emulator named PPSSPP. 

I was very much confused.
            That's awesome  that you modded your Vita.  I have a modded PSP 3000.  It still has great games.
The "hype" was "I get to be cat" and nothing else so idk, I got exactly what I wanted
    same. I was so freaking excited the moment it started and I could start playing with the other cats. This game could have had no real story to it and I'd still return to play in from time to time just for the pure joy of getting to be a cat and explore lmao
Rubbish. It looks to me like we're getting exactly what was promised in the trailers. AFAIK there was no indication about the game's length ahead of launch. Now that it's available and reviews are out, folks can decide whether or not they want a longer game and if this is worth the price of entry. But let's not start slinging mud at developers and suggest they're spamming us. We can do better than that.
    The developers confirmed over a month ago the game would be eight hours in length. I'm going at a moderate pace, and it looks like the game will take me six hours to complete, so the game is about the length they said it would be.
I'm drunk and thought it was a cute game with a cat, but I love that you think I'm clever enough to get paid for this shit.
    Gamers are seriously some of the most miserable fucks on the planet lmao
        +1 

so many bitter entitled fucks. Same ones sending death threats to developers for not making the Fortnite skin they wanted. Not your cup of tea? Move on, nobody cares.
        For real. Unable to enjoy or appreciate anything.
    Sure, you're drunk
Not until Q4, I believe.
Go back to your xbone and cod and let us enjoy being a cat
LMAO I thought I’d pop into this sub to see what it thought of this cute game, stayed for the cringy edgelord reactions.
    Hardly an edge lord reaction, the game does nothing unique and is a walking simulator.
        gAmInG iS dEaD
Sweet can't wait to play then.
Wait what
    It feels a bit like Half Life at times
        I just started, im looking forward to the crowbar, g-man and console commands
            So now that you've had some time, what do you think of the zurks?
For real though is there any challenge to the game at all? I don’t mind if there isn’t, it looks like it’s supposed to be a chill exploration game with some moments of running away
    There’s some little puzzles here and there but nothing difficult. You mainly just explore with a few parts where you have to run from enemies
        .. and a little bit of "combat" where you shine a light on enemies to kill them and manage the little cooldown it has.

There's also a Metal Cat Solid stealth section later on.
Yeah after about 2 hours in and hitting the sewers I was like... Caelid? Is this Caelid? Lol
THE GIANT EYES!!
    Me: Is this Resident Evil?
        Right?? I was NOT expecting that
    It's amazing how off guard it catches you. I remember getting low key jump scared when I noticed them.
    My take away from the gameplay is that every jump is scripted. Is this the case? Like you approach a ledge, hit a button, then there's an animation for a jump.

I was expecting a free-roaming platformer where you have a little more freedom.
        You can more or less choose the angle of the jump, and most elevated platforms can be jumped on top of.
No, it's not a worm.
I love meowing ~~at cameras~~
    I ~~love~~ meow~~ing at cameras~~
        ~~I love~~ meow~~ing at cameras~~
            ***meow***
meowing at the guys tossing paint cans long enough to distract them into dropping them
It's not the same thing at all... Stray is more directed and of a smaller scope. Love it so far.
    They’re not the same but in terms of the overall world-building, lore, design etc. Stray has a much better and more interesting cyberpunk world.
They are completely different types of games and it's unfair to compare them. Stray has a much, much smaller scope, there is no combat, and it has a bigger focus on puzzles. Also, Stray isn't an RPG, its a linear adventure game.
Can't compare the two to be honest.

I'd compare Stray to like.... Shadow of the Colossus. Linear on rails sort of experience. Literally nothing to compare when against cyberpunk.

That or like The Quarry or Until Dawn and such. It's more an interactive movie than it is a "game" if that makes sense. My gf is absolutely loving it and I love to watch her enjoy that. Me myself? I'd rather play Elden Ring or Returnal.
Well, only one game let's you shred the carpet, knock shit out the shelves, mlem and has a dedicated meow button.
[deleted]
    Yes, this is a real thing

Didn't realise wholesome cat game was also >!a psychological horror!<
        Isn't the premise that you are a cat lost from the family so essentially you see the world as a lost house cat would? Cats get scared and frightened easily.
            That's not what's going on in the game. It's a dystopia world that has eldritch monsters in it.
Does any cat get hurt / die during this game? I kind of don't want to play it if this is the case
    Yes but it's not graphic at all and is very brief. I hate seeing cats and dogs die in video games and this games death sequences never really bothered me.
    the cat gets hurt in the beginning during the fall and the limp is realistic enough to hurt your heart, but she licks her leg after a few seconds and is ok. other than that the death sequences are brief and non graphic, the screen just kinda goes red and you go back to your last checkpoint without seeing the cat actually die. not bad at all imo
Idk man having the zurks chase me around gives me way more anxiety than it should
    I had to take a break because I kept dying to them and felt really depressed lol
        My gf really wants to get it but really doesn’t want to see a cat die graphically. Is it like that or a bit more gentle?
            It's really not that bad, they stick to you and then you fall over pretty much. There's no blood or anything. I'm just a huge cat lover and it bothered me to begin with lol
                She’s also a huge cat lover, that’s why she was concerned haha. Good to know she can get into it now!
    Shit chasing me in games always gets me.
That's basically what Abzu is
What "tier" of Playstation Plus membership is required to get this game? I'm very much interested in it, but the tier system that Playstation has released feels like a money grab.
    Otherwise its only 30 bucks. I have the premium ps plus and I'm still going to buy it. I like having my game library unlinked to an active subscription.
        And you're also supporting the studio behind a game you've enjoyed.

Bless you. I'll be doing the same.
    I think it’s the higher 2 tiers
    It's on the "extra" tier. But, it's like 40 to upgrade to it and Stray is only 30.
    None is you pay 30 euros
    I've just left mine on the basic bronze level for now. If I want a game I'll pay for it.
Our cat tried to play with the virtual kitty.
My take away from the gameplay is that every jump is scripted. Is this the case? Like you approach a ledge, hit a button, then there's an animation for a jump.

I was expecting a free-roaming platformer where you have a little more freedom.
    Yes, it is. The animations are beautiful, but the controls feel a bit limiting. You can meow as much as you want if that helps.
        Can I bark?
            [removed]
                I did find a receipt for a joke toilet
                    Has that ever happened to you?!
                        Call me right now please!
                    It's just for farts
            I feel like most people can bark. It's not hard to do. A lot of kids do it when they are playing around.
            It's a 20 dollar dlc.
        If they made it so you had to do the jumps yourself quite a few parts would turn into a jump king cat dlc
        hmmm, yeah. I think I'll pass. I was hoping it would be more like feline witcher3, but its more like feline tomb raider I guess.
            It's more of a puzzle game and less of an open world game. It's entertaining. I'm a couple hours in.
        Disagree with the "beautiful" animations but otherwise a fun game
    Pro tip: After you have played for 30-45 min or so (and probably earlier if you are ok fiddling around), you can turn off the jump markers in the settings with few problems moving forward. 

This makes it feel much more organic and immersive, like you are prompting a real cat to jump who will only do so when they think it is worth it to jump & knows that they can make the jump, rather than just artificially interacting with button prompts. 

It works really well like this IMO because the jump points are (with a few exceptions) very intuitive. So much so that I wish the devs had put in a pop-up early in the game encouraging players to try it out this way.
        I don't know man, I'm almost done with it and there were a few times where I got really frustrated that I couldn't jump on thing that I should've been able to. Particularly behind the night club. Plenty of stuff I should be able to jump on get up there but only one path the game let's you take.
            Sounds like there ought to be a hotkey that highlights jump points for a few seconds
            I can see that for sure. I added a caveat to the last paragraph. My main point wasn’t about whether the traversal system was perfect, but about how the jump markers themselves don’t really make the game any better/easier and can probably be turned off.
                Yeah I got you, I just feel like I needed those jump markers at a couple spots. Either way, getting confused about where I could jump was rare and didn't ruin the game. Most of the time it was intuitive. I had the day off and got it for free with ps+ and it's been really fun. I would've been totally fine paying for the game.
    Yeah. It's kind of annoying. There are dumpsters that you can't jump on right next to dumpsters that look exactly alike but you can jump on, for example.
    This is true. You also can't jump any time either. Idk why but for games that bothers me. I just want to Assassins Creed every possible surface! Lol
    It's very much not a platformer, closer to a puzzle game.

                [removed]
                    Cat.
        When I noticed I clicked on "publisher" and noticed I own about 50% of anything they ever published.

All of those games are very focused. Not sure if I would call that style "simple". Stray is incredibly focused. You play as a cat and they went to 100% cat movement for that. And that is the vehicle by which you explore this very interesting world.
        Neon White is also Annapurna, they aren't all walking simulators, so I disagree with the premise here.
    The story is very linear. The puzzles are as simple as they could possibly be. The majority of the gameplay feels like a point-and-click adventure in 3d. Small sections require you to run from rats, kinda like a watered down version of A Plague Tale.

I was hoping for a game where I could role play as a cat around a city, but this isn't really it.
        Keep in mind it was developed by a small studio. Considering their resources, I think its beyond my own expectations. The puzzles are pretty simple, but I kind of like it.
        Yeah same, I was imagining an open world city that you roam around in with free style movement. Meet quirky side characters or even just meet other cats that you do some stuff for. Would love to see that kind of thing
[deleted]
    I'm about 3 hours in, it's a bit linear, but also offers exploration. In terms of difficulty/challenge, it isn't a difficult game. And the puzzles aren't 'hard'. If you're looking for a challenge in this game, I do not think it's your type of game.
        Are the puzzles easier than Untitled Goose Game?
            I haven't played Untitled Goose Game, but the puzzles in Stray are quite straight forward. If in a small space, there are only a handful of options it could be at. In a bigger space, there are quite some "obvious" hints.
            Yes. I played both and untitled goose game is more puzzles less story. Stray is far prettier and really sucks you into the world.
            Yes they are
            Yes. By a fair margin, too.
        Eh, exploration isn't really rewarded much in this game.
    It feels like I'm playing little nightmares 2 again and it's actually fun even if their isn't a ton of challenges
        I had a similar thought, mine being "I like this even more because there are some more open areas to explore around in and do some optional quest challenge things"

I love it
    Only about an hour in myself but there are puzzles to solve to get through the world.
        I'm like 4 hours in and I haven't found a puzzle that was actually interesting yet. They all have been incredibly simple and took no effort to solve, which isn't really rewarding.
            I love the art and the gameplay itself but man this game is incredibly easy. . I really like it but I honestly think a 19.99 price point is a bit more fair
    Skillup has a good Review on it.
That's my issue right now actually.  My car won't leave the screen alone
[Because it's a game that just came out today](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/game-review-stray-redefines-the-adventure-genre-with-a-cats-eye-view/).
It's a video game, with a cat and youre on the internet. Get ready to see it everywhere lol
    >It's a video game, with a cat

and ray tracing!

Edit: I thought I saw ray tracing in a gameplay preview...maybe I'm misremembering.
Reddit loves cats and indie games.
Fun linear adventure game, where you play as a regular ol cat.
    This is a pretty smart fucking cat.  Nothing regular about him.
We've been waiting for this game for something like 6 years now from the first sneak peek. And it just came out today.
Meow
It's called marketing
    Not really. It's literally good looking game about cat. That was it. Thats the extent of the marketing. That was enough for everyone else to market it for them. For what it is it's great, would I pay $40 for it? Nah. But it was first day to playstations version of gamepass so wtf do I care. 

Good game. Could it be more? Sure. So can everything.
        I didn't imply it wasn't a good game or that regular people weren't sharing posts about it. Someone asked why they were seeing it everywhere and I gave them the answer.
            I know. I just don't see this as really the effects of a terrific marketing team or anything like that. Just a byproduct of the internets love for cats.
                Marketing 101: *Include a cat*

Profit.
                    100%. Friends have been saying how their non gamer gf wants this game. 

You can never underestimate the power of the cat. And if you do, they will pounce on you and ruin your electronics because the stupid little bastard can't stop chewing on wires and....

.... Anyways yes, the answer is cats.
Effective viral marketing and it had a successful teaser post get popular on this subreddit a month or two ago.
    Dude it was in the original ps5 games announcement
    This game was originally shown on reddit like, 5+ years ago. One of those "I'm making my first game and here's the first clip" deals." It was pretty organic afaik. This game has been looked forward to by a lot of people for a long time.
        The first I heard of it was that big post a month or two ago. That explains things a bit!
Was watching a friend play it on twitch, i think they spent 4 hours just pushing objects off of ledges and giggling about it.
    This is why I haven't finished the game yet. I've spent a lot of time wandering and pushing stuff off ledges. Also trying to find all the collectibles and memories. I will have to go back to one chapter Cuse I went to the next area, not realizing I was
30$ for a 4 hour game really detracts from my desire to purchase it. Guess I'll wait until it goes on sale.
Haven't played it but watched a review and 2 things cooled my enthusiasm for it:  
1. There is no actual jump button. If you position the cat in a direction it can jump, it will say press x or whatever and the game completes the jump for you. This would take away from the fluidity of the immersion for me.  
2. The reviewer said he beat the game in 5 hours. That's like indie game short. For something that's been this hyped up I would have expected at least 8 hours of gameplay.
    > That's like indie game short.

...its an indie game
    Point 1 makes it a no buy for me. I haven't been able to get into a single game that breaks up the regular gameplay with button prompts in that way.
        You can turn the jump prompts off. It's pretty easy to tell what you can and can't jump on.
Overhyped for a $30 game?  

That seems harsh.   Had I paid $69.99 for it, it'd be upset.   For what it is on initial play through, and going back for trophies..

7 hours on my first play through, got about 45% of the trophies blind.   Talked to damn near every character in the game.   

$30 sits just fine for me.   

It's a pretty, indie, cat game, with some weird Sci-Fi elements...

No complaints.
Not that this game isn't good, but you might want to temper your expectations. Really just an idea for life in general...
    I have a 5 year old and an 8 year old. My little guy loves cats, but doesn't seem like a little kid game. You think he is too young?
        If you play with them (AKA  on the couch with them, on your phone while they play) it should be alright as there are some chase sequences that may be scary for a young child.


Other than that the main 'slums' area is basically a big playground if you aren't trying to solve puzzles or do quests.  Letting them play there would be fine.
            Thanks for the info, I appreciate it!
        I'm halfway through the game, and there are a few chase scenes where you get swarmed by robotic insects. Some people might find that uncomfortable, especially children. I think it's pretty family friendly, though. If you get hit by a bug, it's not graphic, they just latch onto you. The cat can die if there are enough insects on you, but the screen just gets redder then fades to black. It's also obvious when you are in a dangerous area, and most of the game you are in a safe area, so you can take over the controller to handle the dangerous parts if your kids get too scared. Also, some of the robots are implied to curse, but it's censored ******.

Any achievement for that? I've done it plenty of times but nothing really comes of it
    Think you need to scratch *all* points in all levels for an achievement. I didn't get one, but I also didn't really hunt them down.
Holy shit I haven't played Flower in like a decade. I loved that game.
    I wish I could just enjoy Flower but I'm so bad at controlling the wind it ends up being a frustrating experience for me. I know it's 100% my fault. The setting is beautiful.
        Can’t you adjust the sensitivity on that? Or have you and it still frustrates you?
Journey is one of my favourite games ever. The ending feels like what I imagine dying and going to heaven is like. I've played it multiple times just to experience that ending again.
    I was tripping while playing journey the first time and it all made so much sense to me in that mindset. You’re going through life, some parts of it are really fun and easy like the sand sliding level. Some parts are hard and scary like the parts where the metal whales are chasing you. People come into your journey randomly and some stay for just a little while, some of them stay with you through several chapters of your life, even to the end. Climbing the final mountain with a companion you had for a majority of the game was actually emotional. Then the rebirth and ascension to the top of the mountain, only to slowly walk into the light together again. Unbelievable game
Abzu as well. Flow is a neat one too.
Journey is soooooooooooo good. Played that for the very first time ever while on some mushrooms and it was so beautiful
Abzu is very good
Like the other person said, Sable is freaking *gorgeous.* It's got decently fun yet simple gameplay to it as well.
Sable is amazing. A bit buggy but so beautiful
im playing sable on the side right now. such a chill game
Sable is beautiful. I just wish the “call bike” function actually worked. The Japanese Breakfast soundtrack makes up for it though.
Abzu is great on acid.
    I played through that whole game just on the other side of a peak from 4 tabs.

Legit had tears during that last sequence with the music and colors and all. 

Absolutely incredible game. 10/10. 20/10 on acid.
>Little kitty big city

That looks so adorable...

    I think that it has enough similarities that people who enjoy Stray would also like Little Nightmares. 

Both rely on the player solving puzzles to get through obstacles, strange & unsettling background settings, simple gameplay that doesn’t require much focus, short gameplay, ambient soundtrack, and both games follow the main character on a journey.
Cloudpunk is a really chill game...until it isn't.
As in you play as an animal, sure... anything else, no, not really.
Possibly the most underrated game of all time. I spent so much time unlocking all those damn animals.
I think we will with the little tease at the end
It was a mass success for BlueTwelve studios. I'm really hoping for a sequel, seems likely with the semi-open ending and the positive feedback. I'd love a sequel!
Got it on sale last year and it was great. I'm assuming you've played Limbo as well?
Thanks. Inside has a trial and is currently 75% off.
    It's coming to Game Pass as well.
Inside was great. Made by the same people who made Limbo I believe, which is also really good.
That game was cool. Little easy and short but really cool atmosphere.

Gameplay reminds me quite a bit of some older (but more challenging) games like Prince or Persia, Another World, and Flashback.

Blackthorn is another rad old game that’s similar, but with a shotgun!
    Yooo, Blackthorn was one of the first games I played on my garage sale homemade pc back in the late 90s. A Blizzard classic.
        Hey I was playing the shareware version back then too, windows 3.1 machine with a whopping 25 MHz cpu. 😂

I have the snes rom and still go back and play it every couple years or so. Still fun.
            I loved blackthorn too!!
I have a feeling you don't know Limbo. If you don't, you'll love it. I've played inside once. I've played Limbo about 6 times already and I don't replay games. Like at all. (It's from the same studio, their previous game, absolute masterpiece).
    So I had the misfortune of playing Limbo *after* I played Inside. It's hard for me to want to go back to Limbo knowing I could replay Inside instead. Something about Inside resonated more with me than Limbo, even though it's a great game in its own right. 

I also have to admit I think Inside is the better game. Visually, game-play, and sound design just hits more. Seems like the studio took what they learned from Limbo and applied it to Inside.
        Interesting, I would argue the opposite :D. Inside is a larger project, but I've loved the journey in Limbo. It's a journey through life and while I wouldn't form that idea on my own, I've surely felt it while playing:

The boy died in the forest and awakens in limbo (the world between life and death). The soul can only get out of limbo when the body is properly buried. The boy continues through limbo until his sister finds and buries his body. In the ending scene, she is covering his grave.

Also, the whole journey is like a journey through life. Fear of spiders and water is overcome only to be replaced of the fear of bullying, character goes from forests to work environment and so on and so forth.

Anyways, the point is, I love Limbo because of that artistic overarching vision that guided the project. I was surprised that I didn't have that feeling with Inside.
Yep. I mean, folks can enjoy whatever they like and I don't mind if people prefer longer games. That's totally cool. But the crowd who totally dismiss shorter games and accuse devs of being lazy or whatever... they're missing the point by a country mile. Games like Inside are examples of shorter, beautifully-crafted experiences. I'm not suggesting that folks have to like them - to each their own - but it's the dismissal and naysaying that annoys me.
    Agreed. Why dismiss these shorter games? What have you got to lose? I'd happily play an engaging several hour experience rather than the same multiplayer shoot-loot-shoot-loop on repeat. But you're right: everyone has the right to their own preferences.
Inside is awesome
So you ever heard of this game called… Little Nightmares
Yep, that’s me with Red Dead. 

The grind of a massive map, doing tiny little tasks. I enjoy the idea of it, but then I actually get into it and… aaaa
I love strategy games and I always struggle with this. I’ll have a free weekend and just dump hours into an EU4 game. Then a month later when I have time, I load it up like ‘wtf was I even doing?’ and start a new game.
If you don't lock yourself up in a bunch of side quests you can beat cyberpunk in around 20 hours
ZELDA BOTW
Yeah, it's pretty easy you can do it in around one and a half hours so there is a lot of time to spare
Around 5 first time and 1,5 while doing it for the second time for trophy
    Wow, wasn’t expecting it to be THAT short. Stray has been my most anticipated GOTY so it’s a bit disappointing to hear that it’s not longer but I’m sure it’s jam packed with great content! Would rather it be shorter and really well done than long where everything seems like it’s dragging on.
Good bothunter
This is a bot
    This is a bot
Anyone got the “bring in a dead bird and leave it next to the bed” collectable?
    No sorry only the bring in an almost dead bird that starts flapping around like crazy as soon as the cat lets go causing chaos and a lot of stress collectable
you CAN scratch up carpets and the occasional wall.
    So are there a lot of vertical climbing surfaces?  Or is it just curtains?  Never played it… but my cats insist curtains are made for just that.
        I’ve come across one curtain to scratch up so far
That's actually the way you solve some of the puzzles.
    *BAPBAPPING INTENSIFIES*
        skippity paps*
Yes...  I literally knocked every paint can, bottle, coffee cup off every ledge I could while playing through.
Yes. Repeatedly
I feel this.  My cat eats every stupid ass thing.
So do mine
Motion sickness is always the first thing I turn off.

    Did people downvote this comment for some reason or does reddit just like hiding comments for having just a small amount of upvotes?
        I was thinking the same thing.  Comment was hidden, but didn't say it was below the score threshold.  Was assuming it was someone saying "ACKSHUALLY...".  But no...regular ol' comment.
            I saw it okay among all the comments in the thread (BaconReader on mobile)
So I need to become an actual cat, got it.
    Make sure to knock things off of shelves and tables too.
Don't close the box though, or no one will know if you're alive or not.
Is this serious? If it is...
Why this homie getting down voted he is dead ass right.
I actually like motion blur. I know that sacrilegious to say but I don't care. I understand that it can be implemented to hide frame drops but I still like it. I don't think that it's bad just because it has a purpose other than it's surface value. 

I'll keep it on, even when my 3080 is pushing solid 120+ frames.

There’s no fov slider? 


Aaannnnnd I’m not buying it till there’s a mod to fix that.

Edit: downvote me if you want. I like cats too, but we need to have standards. It’s ridiculous not to have an fov slider in 2022.
    Not sure why this is so downvoted. I can understand not everyone caring about fov sliders but as stated here it is important for some people. And tbh in 2022 tthey should be almost standard across the board considering how many years people have been complaining about a lack of fov sliders in games.
    TotalBiscuit's spirit lives on. There is zero reason a game shouldn't have options for every effect the game has. Some games the effects don't bother me and others they are obnoxious.
    I agree with you. Fov slider should be in every game by default. I was thinking buying this but if theres no fov option i wont. Im one of those people who get motion sickness when fov is too low cant play games with low fov. I will upvote you if it helps.
I get major, major motion sickness (even riding in the passenger side of a car in the front when someone else is driving makes me feel sick anymore, a common issue for people with migraines), and I felt fine after turning off motion blur and capping the FPS
I love that spot too. So cozy ☺️
Yeah the fall had me go "oh no nononono NO". The murrs of panic and pain had me teary eyed.
I explored a fair amount, and I got about 6 hours of game play. Which isn't a bad thing. I think if the game were longer it might have felt a tiny bit dragged out. 

I think it's really worth the price. The movement, music, and world building were all great. It's been a long time since I've played a game that's just it's own thing. Nothing complicated, no in depth mechanics. The game is what it says it is and honestly it was an incredibly refreshing experience. Perfect game for a "non-gamer" too, if you're trying to get one of your loved ones into the hobby. 

That said, I absolutely love cats so my bias may be speaking a bit here.
    Makes me hopeful for a sequel, or even better, and more lengthy storyline. It wouldn’t even necessarily need to change the formula or assets up. Just more of what it’s already doing.
Depends on how much you explore and how much of the backstory/collectables you are hunting.  

There is an achievement for finishing it in under two hours, but I'm looking at an easy 8-10.
    Ah, so it's the length of 1 run through a Dwemer ruins.
        its infinitely more fun though
I finished the game in a single playthrough, being curious and talking to everyone, rubbing against legs and everything.  

7 hours of gameplay beginning to end.   

Netting about 45% of the trophies blind.
My son just finished it today, it's not that long
I've played 8 and I'm at 40 something percent, so not necessarily. I've also missed some of the collectibles. 

If you are only doing the story and not looking around at all, then maybe, but even the first level is large and complex enough imo that it'd probably be difficult unless you've played it and are going for the achievement.

I bought it before it came out and I really don't regret the price.
I'm currently at 6 hours, trying to get all of the achievements, and I've only reached the mid-to-end portion of the game. However, I did spend around an hour of my time just  exploring, appreciating, and casually messing around as an adorable kitty.. It's definitely something I never realized I wanted to so badly in a video game! XD
Movies typically have a much shorter range of runtimes. And much shorter run times overall. 75 minutes minimum to what, 150, 180 max. The significant value metric isnt quantity here.

But games can go from 2 hours to 100+ in some cases. This spread is enough that most people would pay significantly more for a long game with the same quality as a short one. Time spent becomes a significant metric, because quality being equal, I'm getting much more value out of a longer game. With such a long spread in playtimes, significantly more development effort is also spent on longer games than shorter ones.

That's not to say time is the only metric, of course.
Yup. Even still if you get enjoyment out of it you're paying $5.00/hr to have fun.
As someone who games 40+ hours a week, I can't afford to be dropping $30 on something I can knock out in a few hours. Bigger and longer doesn't necessarily mean better, but I have played plenty of excellent games (including some masterpieces) that I was able to sink 100+ hours into at a cheaper price than this game. If it ever drops to $10 I'll give it a whirl.
25$ can feed you for a week in some places
It's a game about being a cat, not sure what you expected lol. This isn't going to be some Mass Effect level of story.
    It’s actually funny, there’s quite a bit of interesting story being presented and I was just running after a ball, pawing at it while they were talking about it. 

It’s very much a cat simulator lol
What exactly did you expect?
If you want to buy the game just grab the PlayStation version of gamepass. Half the price ($40 vs $21 here in Canada) and you can play it and all kinds of other shit. 

Literally why it was a day one service game was to motivate people towards this. Just cancel before your month is up. Don't allow auto renew.
Totally. Cats are way better
That’s not the problem of the game developer. That’s the problem of the customer. The game is “half a game” according to the playtime argument, and it’s half the price of a standard PS5 game.
thank you so much!
No YOU'RE a towel.
lol, yeah, I couldn't even finish Death Stranding. I kept waiting for it to be fun, couple hours in I gave up.
    Feel your pain. I did the same, but for RDR2.
Death Stranding broke me too lmao. I stopped playing a little over halfway through. great graphics and music. cool backstory. but just got tried of making sam walk, esp when I was carrying heavy things for transport. ugh :(
As a prior cat owner, no you wouldn't. 

Oh you meant in game.
That and I wish I could control the jump instead of jumping where it tells me
I didn't even realize I'd missed a joke, until I got this far..
They always respond to German.
Imagine paying $30 for a 4 hour walking simulator.
    You're right people paid 60 for Death Stranding to deliver Amazon packages.
    I've paid close to that for one meal, and more than half of that to see a movie. I'm not interested in this specific walking simulator, but I'm also not opposed to the idea in principle.
        Look at mister money bags over here
    This is what happens when you are raised on mobile and free to play games.
    Four hours in and no regrets.  I've spent more on visual novels.  Different strokes for different folks but this is a charming game. 

It's also not purely a walking sim. There's puzzles etc
    $30 dollars is nothing for a decent game. Get a better job
        I can't get a better job. Can you gift me a copy since it's nothing to you?
    I pay more than that to see a 1.5 hour movie at the cinemas, haha. So $30 for a beautiful, contained experience is no problem at all.
        I just upgraded the rest of my ps+ subscription for $15. So I can play Stray and whatever else on the list that I want to for the next 5 months
Lmao people are allowed to dislike something you like Jesus. Just because it's indie doesn't mean people can't dislike it because it wasn't what they were looking for.
    I never said they weren't allowed to dislike it, and since I haven't played the game I don't like or dislike it myself. What I tried to say was that their expectations were just ridiculous. It's like buying Bloodborne and being disappointed that the map size can't rival Ubisoft open-worlds.
I heard there's a Grumman F6F Hellcat.
    Ok I will keep looking for sure
Honestly I expected the game to be much more like a Star Wars simulator. There arent any AT-ATs. There arent any TIE Fighters. Not even so much as an E-Web. You cant set blasters to stun. You cant even have the high ground. It's just so simple and empty.
    Honestly I expected the game to be much more like a Tenchu 3: Wrath of Heaven remake. There arent any katanas. There arent any grappling hooks. Not even so much as some rice. You cant kill for Lord Gohda. You cant even be a ninja. It's just so simple and empty.
It's about a "cat" not a "gat", I can see the confusion though.
The jumping system they have now makes it much more realistic to how a cat would actually traverse. It's not a 3D mario platformer, or a survival cat RPG, it's an adventure game where you play as a cat.
    Yes.

When my cat is wearing her backpack and solving puzzles around the house, I noticed she only jumps when a prompt come up.

100% realism confirmed.
    So wait, you CAN jump?  Cause the person I replied said there's no jumping at all.
        My understanding is that jumping is a context button.

In other words, you can only jump when and where the game lets you.
            It feels like the Zipline and ledge grabbing in the Arkham games.
            You can jump onto most surfaces and platforms, its not a restrictive as you are making it seem
        What they meant was you can't just jump whenever you want. Stand next to ledge or a gap and a button prompt will appear on screen. Press the button and the cat does a jump to where the prompt was. 

I didn't buy the game but I agree with them it looks very limiting. Sure the way they've done it the animations look smooth and very realistic but I personally enjoy my freedom to hop around like an idiot in other games.
            Whenever you find yourself asking "Hey, it looks like I should be able to jump there, can I jump there?", the VAST majority of the time the answer is going to be yes. 

Jumping is a fundamental part of the game. I often found myself jumping to places that didn't even lead to anything. So it's not as if the only jumps you can make are the ones on the story path.
                I haven't played it. I'm waiting for actual reviews to come out instead of OMG CAT!!1! 

I'm glad you find it non limiting and open. Personally to me it looks very limited and I think the game probably just isn't for me. If you're enjoying it, more power to you.
        It's a canned animation. You push the button and it just does it for you. You don't aim it, you can't miss time it. That's probably what he means. It has jumping in the same way that one CoD game had respect paying. You push the button and the game plays itself. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing but a lot of people seemed to think this was gonna be a cat platformer.
        Technically yes, it's a big part of the game. It's odd but I think it fits very well with what the game is. I don't think a normal jumping system would fit with how the levels work.
That's exactly what stopped me from buying it. I was ready to buy it on launch but I watched a review last night where the guy was trying to be enthusiastic but still mentioned the prompt based jumping and I was immediately turned off.
    This is sounding like a morbius situation, but I think people are doing it unironically, like they like the thought of a cat game and can't see any flaws with it. Is this game actually considered good or not?
        I'm throughly enjoying it and some of the "you  can't jump" comments are making me laugh cause it sounds like people expected cat parkour.

It's a linear story about a cat who is just chilling with their cat clan until they fall into a walled in city where all the humans are dead but robots remain.  

You find out what's going on by proceeding through the city. There's puzzles, memories and collectibles along the way. 

You can scratch things, meow your head off, trip a robot, rub against a robot,  break items etc. You have to not be nommed by half like looking bugs when you're not in robot city 

I'm four hours in and I'm throughly enjoying it so far cause I'm also looking for everything without a walk-through.

So, if you like that sort of thing then it's a good game for you. If not then no. But it's definitely a good game IMHO
        I think it's getting attention because it's different which is great. But from what I've gathered from other comments it's pretty and you can do a lot of cat stuff but except for specific circumstances it's pointless actions and it still feels lacking.
Right? The viral marketing tactics for this game are insane. It doesn't even look interesting.
The jumping system they have now makes it much more realistic to how a cat would actually traverse. It's not a 3D mario platformer, or a survival cat RPG, it's an adventure game where you play as a cat.
    Well it's also a video game about a cat solving puzzles. Kinda weird to think the jumping system is fine because it's realistic when the entire premise of the game is fantasy.
        They are still trying simulate a real cat protagonist. Without the odd claw durability system and hunger meter that others wanted.
You are jumping all the time, but you can only jump if you have somewhere to jump TO. Cats don't just randomly bounce up and down (unless maybe playing with a ball). They walk or jog along, and the lithely jump to a specific ledge, or down, or whatever. You can jump loads, and really are jumping all the time, it is just a jump with deliberation.
It sounds like people got their expectations way too high thinking this was supposed to be some big cat RPG when it's literally never been advertised as such so I'm not sure where all this confusion is coming from. It reminds me of people getting angry about lightyear because Tim Allen wasn't in it and they couldn't understand or fathom the possibility that a product could be different than how fans would imagine things to be due to hype or expectations that grow to a fever pitch so we end up disappointing ourselves all on our own (generally speaking)
    Lol true. I’m super happy with the game tbh. I played for hours yesterday and didn’t feel bored ever once.
Well, with how Reddit and other platforms have hyped it up, I'm not surprised he thought that. The hype for this game is unreal, this studio produces indie, linear gems like What Remains of Edith Finch, and this detail is lost when people describe and hype this game as the next huge thing, the game isn't trying to advertise itself as something so grand, it's own fanbase is doing that sadly.
Have you played it? How is what he said wrong? Cause I’m playing it right now and it’s pretty boring
Who says we're expecting a Skyrim style RPG? The point is it lacks basic features. You'd think you can free roam and jump around whereever in a game like this.
    The OP of the thread you're talking in said that.
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pspspsps

>Pspspsps is an onomatopoeia used to recreate the sound some make to get the attention of a cat. It has been used in a series of jokes about futile attempts to attract a cat.
It's an onomatopoeia that you say to attract a cat.

perchance.
    You can’t just say perchance.
It's the noise people make to get a cat's attention.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pspspsps
    Ahhh thank you!!! I've recently gotten into modding my PS Vita and so I've become aware of the emulator named PPSSPP. 

I was very much confused.
        That's awesome  that you modded your Vita.  I have a modded PSP 3000.  It still has great games.
same. I was so freaking excited the moment it started and I could start playing with the other cats. This game could have had no real story to it and I'd still return to play in from time to time just for the pure joy of getting to be a cat and explore lmao
The developers confirmed over a month ago the game would be eight hours in length. I'm going at a moderate pace, and it looks like the game will take me six hours to complete, so the game is about the length they said it would be.
Gamers are seriously some of the most miserable fucks on the planet lmao
    +1 

so many bitter entitled fucks. Same ones sending death threats to developers for not making the Fortnite skin they wanted. Not your cup of tea? Move on, nobody cares.
    For real. Unable to enjoy or appreciate anything.
Sure, you're drunk
Hardly an edge lord reaction, the game does nothing unique and is a walking simulator.
    gAmInG iS dEaD
It feels a bit like Half Life at times
    I just started, im looking forward to the crowbar, g-man and console commands
        So now that you've had some time, what do you think of the zurks?
There’s some little puzzles here and there but nothing difficult. You mainly just explore with a few parts where you have to run from enemies
    .. and a little bit of "combat" where you shine a light on enemies to kill them and manage the little cooldown it has.

There's also a Metal Cat Solid stealth section later on.
Me: Is this Resident Evil?
    Right?? I was NOT expecting that
It's amazing how off guard it catches you. I remember getting low key jump scared when I noticed them.
My take away from the gameplay is that every jump is scripted. Is this the case? Like you approach a ledge, hit a button, then there's an animation for a jump.

I was expecting a free-roaming platformer where you have a little more freedom.
    You can more or less choose the angle of the jump, and most elevated platforms can be jumped on top of.

They’re not the same but in terms of the overall world-building, lore, design etc. Stray has a much better and more interesting cyberpunk world.
Yes, this is a real thing

Didn't realise wholesome cat game was also >!a psychological horror!<
    Isn't the premise that you are a cat lost from the family so essentially you see the world as a lost house cat would? Cats get scared and frightened easily.
        That's not what's going on in the game. It's a dystopia world that has eldritch monsters in it.
Yes but it's not graphic at all and is very brief. I hate seeing cats and dogs die in video games and this games death sequences never really bothered me.
the cat gets hurt in the beginning during the fall and the limp is realistic enough to hurt your heart, but she licks her leg after a few seconds and is ok. other than that the death sequences are brief and non graphic, the screen just kinda goes red and you go back to your last checkpoint without seeing the cat actually die. not bad at all imo
I had to take a break because I kept dying to them and felt really depressed lol
    My gf really wants to get it but really doesn’t want to see a cat die graphically. Is it like that or a bit more gentle?
        It's really not that bad, they stick to you and then you fall over pretty much. There's no blood or anything. I'm just a huge cat lover and it bothered me to begin with lol
            She’s also a huge cat lover, that’s why she was concerned haha. Good to know she can get into it now!
Shit chasing me in games always gets me.
Otherwise its only 30 bucks. I have the premium ps plus and I'm still going to buy it. I like having my game library unlinked to an active subscription.
    And you're also supporting the studio behind a game you've enjoyed.

Bless you. I'll be doing the same.
I think it’s the higher 2 tiers
It's on the "extra" tier. But, it's like 40 to upgrade to it and Stray is only 30.
None is you pay 30 euros
I've just left mine on the basic bronze level for now. If I want a game I'll pay for it.
Yes, it is. The animations are beautiful, but the controls feel a bit limiting. You can meow as much as you want if that helps.

        I feel like most people can bark. It's not hard to do. A lot of kids do it when they are playing around.
        It's a 20 dollar dlc.
    If they made it so you had to do the jumps yourself quite a few parts would turn into a jump king cat dlc
    hmmm, yeah. I think I'll pass. I was hoping it would be more like feline witcher3, but its more like feline tomb raider I guess.
        It's more of a puzzle game and less of an open world game. It's entertaining. I'm a couple hours in.
    Disagree with the "beautiful" animations but otherwise a fun game
Pro tip: After you have played for 30-45 min or so (and probably earlier if you are ok fiddling around), you can turn off the jump markers in the settings with few problems moving forward. 

This makes it feel much more organic and immersive, like you are prompting a real cat to jump who will only do so when they think it is worth it to jump & knows that they can make the jump, rather than just artificially interacting with button prompts. 

It works really well like this IMO because the jump points are (with a few exceptions) very intuitive. So much so that I wish the devs had put in a pop-up early in the game encouraging players to try it out this way.
    I don't know man, I'm almost done with it and there were a few times where I got really frustrated that I couldn't jump on thing that I should've been able to. Particularly behind the night club. Plenty of stuff I should be able to jump on get up there but only one path the game let's you take.
        Sounds like there ought to be a hotkey that highlights jump points for a few seconds
        I can see that for sure. I added a caveat to the last paragraph. My main point wasn’t about whether the traversal system was perfect, but about how the jump markers themselves don’t really make the game any better/easier and can probably be turned off.
            Yeah I got you, I just feel like I needed those jump markers at a couple spots. Either way, getting confused about where I could jump was rare and didn't ruin the game. Most of the time it was intuitive. I had the day off and got it for free with ps+ and it's been really fun. I would've been totally fine paying for the game.
Yeah. It's kind of annoying. There are dumpsters that you can't jump on right next to dumpsters that look exactly alike but you can jump on, for example.
This is true. You also can't jump any time either. Idk why but for games that bothers me. I just want to Assassins Creed every possible surface! Lol
It's very much not a platformer, closer to a puzzle game.

    When I noticed I clicked on "publisher" and noticed I own about 50% of anything they ever published.

All of those games are very focused. Not sure if I would call that style "simple". Stray is incredibly focused. You play as a cat and they went to 100% cat movement for that. And that is the vehicle by which you explore this very interesting world.
    Neon White is also Annapurna, they aren't all walking simulators, so I disagree with the premise here.
The story is very linear. The puzzles are as simple as they could possibly be. The majority of the gameplay feels like a point-and-click adventure in 3d. Small sections require you to run from rats, kinda like a watered down version of A Plague Tale.

I was hoping for a game where I could role play as a cat around a city, but this isn't really it.
    Keep in mind it was developed by a small studio. Considering their resources, I think its beyond my own expectations. The puzzles are pretty simple, but I kind of like it.
    Yeah same, I was imagining an open world city that you roam around in with free style movement. Meet quirky side characters or even just meet other cats that you do some stuff for. Would love to see that kind of thing
I'm about 3 hours in, it's a bit linear, but also offers exploration. In terms of difficulty/challenge, it isn't a difficult game. And the puzzles aren't 'hard'. If you're looking for a challenge in this game, I do not think it's your type of game.
    Are the puzzles easier than Untitled Goose Game?
        I haven't played Untitled Goose Game, but the puzzles in Stray are quite straight forward. If in a small space, there are only a handful of options it could be at. In a bigger space, there are quite some "obvious" hints.
        Yes. I played both and untitled goose game is more puzzles less story. Stray is far prettier and really sucks you into the world.
        Yes they are
        Yes. By a fair margin, too.
    Eh, exploration isn't really rewarded much in this game.
It feels like I'm playing little nightmares 2 again and it's actually fun even if their isn't a ton of challenges
    I had a similar thought, mine being "I like this even more because there are some more open areas to explore around in and do some optional quest challenge things"

I love it
Only about an hour in myself but there are puzzles to solve to get through the world.
    I'm like 4 hours in and I haven't found a puzzle that was actually interesting yet. They all have been incredibly simple and took no effort to solve, which isn't really rewarding.
        I love the art and the gameplay itself but man this game is incredibly easy. . I really like it but I honestly think a 19.99 price point is a bit more fair
Skillup has a good Review on it.
>It's a video game, with a cat

and ray tracing!

Edit: I thought I saw ray tracing in a gameplay preview...maybe I'm misremembering.
This is a pretty smart fucking cat.  Nothing regular about him.
Not really. It's literally good looking game about cat. That was it. Thats the extent of the marketing. That was enough for everyone else to market it for them. For what it is it's great, would I pay $40 for it? Nah. But it was first day to playstations version of gamepass so wtf do I care. 

Good game. Could it be more? Sure. So can everything.
    I didn't imply it wasn't a good game or that regular people weren't sharing posts about it. Someone asked why they were seeing it everywhere and I gave them the answer.
        I know. I just don't see this as really the effects of a terrific marketing team or anything like that. Just a byproduct of the internets love for cats.
            Marketing 101: *Include a cat*

Profit.
                100%. Friends have been saying how their non gamer gf wants this game. 

You can never underestimate the power of the cat. And if you do, they will pounce on you and ruin your electronics because the stupid little bastard can't stop chewing on wires and....

.... Anyways yes, the answer is cats.
Dude it was in the original ps5 games announcement
This game was originally shown on reddit like, 5+ years ago. One of those "I'm making my first game and here's the first clip" deals." It was pretty organic afaik. This game has been looked forward to by a lot of people for a long time.
    The first I heard of it was that big post a month or two ago. That explains things a bit!
This is why I haven't finished the game yet. I've spent a lot of time wandering and pushing stuff off ledges. Also trying to find all the collectibles and memories. I will have to go back to one chapter Cuse I went to the next area, not realizing I was
> That's like indie game short.

...its an indie game
Point 1 makes it a no buy for me. I haven't been able to get into a single game that breaks up the regular gameplay with button prompts in that way.
    You can turn the jump prompts off. It's pretty easy to tell what you can and can't jump on.
I have a 5 year old and an 8 year old. My little guy loves cats, but doesn't seem like a little kid game. You think he is too young?
    If you play with them (AKA  on the couch with them, on your phone while they play) it should be alright as there are some chase sequences that may be scary for a young child.


Other than that the main 'slums' area is basically a big playground if you aren't trying to solve puzzles or do quests.  Letting them play there would be fine.
        Thanks for the info, I appreciate it!
    I'm halfway through the game, and there are a few chase scenes where you get swarmed by robotic insects. Some people might find that uncomfortable, especially children. I think it's pretty family friendly, though. If you get hit by a bug, it's not graphic, they just latch onto you. The cat can die if there are enough insects on you, but the screen just gets redder then fades to black. It's also obvious when you are in a dangerous area, and most of the game you are in a safe area, so you can take over the controller to handle the dangerous parts if your kids get too scared. Also, some of the robots are implied to curse, but it's censored ******.
Think you need to scratch *all* points in all levels for an achievement. I didn't get one, but I also didn't really hunt them down.
I wish I could just enjoy Flower but I'm so bad at controlling the wind it ends up being a frustrating experience for me. I know it's 100% my fault. The setting is beautiful.
    Can’t you adjust the sensitivity on that? Or have you and it still frustrates you?
I was tripping while playing journey the first time and it all made so much sense to me in that mindset. You’re going through life, some parts of it are really fun and easy like the sand sliding level. Some parts are hard and scary like the parts where the metal whales are chasing you. People come into your journey randomly and some stay for just a little while, some of them stay with you through several chapters of your life, even to the end. Climbing the final mountain with a companion you had for a majority of the game was actually emotional. Then the rebirth and ascension to the top of the mountain, only to slowly walk into the light together again. Unbelievable game
I played through that whole game just on the other side of a peak from 4 tabs.

Legit had tears during that last sequence with the music and colors and all. 

Absolutely incredible game. 10/10. 20/10 on acid.
I think that it has enough similarities that people who enjoy Stray would also like Little Nightmares. 

Both rely on the player solving puzzles to get through obstacles, strange & unsettling background settings, simple gameplay that doesn’t require much focus, short gameplay, ambient soundtrack, and both games follow the main character on a journey.
It's coming to Game Pass as well.
Yooo, Blackthorn was one of the first games I played on my garage sale homemade pc back in the late 90s. A Blizzard classic.
    Hey I was playing the shareware version back then too, windows 3.1 machine with a whopping 25 MHz cpu. 😂

I have the snes rom and still go back and play it every couple years or so. Still fun.
        I loved blackthorn too!!
So I had the misfortune of playing Limbo *after* I played Inside. It's hard for me to want to go back to Limbo knowing I could replay Inside instead. Something about Inside resonated more with me than Limbo, even though it's a great game in its own right. 

I also have to admit I think Inside is the better game. Visually, game-play, and sound design just hits more. Seems like the studio took what they learned from Limbo and applied it to Inside.
    Interesting, I would argue the opposite :D. Inside is a larger project, but I've loved the journey in Limbo. It's a journey through life and while I wouldn't form that idea on my own, I've surely felt it while playing:

The boy died in the forest and awakens in limbo (the world between life and death). The soul can only get out of limbo when the body is properly buried. The boy continues through limbo until his sister finds and buries his body. In the ending scene, she is covering his grave.

Also, the whole journey is like a journey through life. Fear of spiders and water is overcome only to be replaced of the fear of bullying, character goes from forests to work environment and so on and so forth.

Anyways, the point is, I love Limbo because of that artistic overarching vision that guided the project. I was surprised that I didn't have that feeling with Inside.
Agreed. Why dismiss these shorter games? What have you got to lose? I'd happily play an engaging several hour experience rather than the same multiplayer shoot-loot-shoot-loop on repeat. But you're right: everyone has the right to their own preferences.
Wow, wasn’t expecting it to be THAT short. Stray has been my most anticipated GOTY so it’s a bit disappointing to hear that it’s not longer but I’m sure it’s jam packed with great content! Would rather it be shorter and really well done than long where everything seems like it’s dragging on.
This is a bot
No sorry only the bring in an almost dead bird that starts flapping around like crazy as soon as the cat lets go causing chaos and a lot of stress collectable
So are there a lot of vertical climbing surfaces?  Or is it just curtains?  Never played it… but my cats insist curtains are made for just that.
    I’ve come across one curtain to scratch up so far

Did people downvote this comment for some reason or does reddit just like hiding comments for having just a small amount of upvotes?
    I was thinking the same thing.  Comment was hidden, but didn't say it was below the score threshold.  Was assuming it was someone saying "ACKSHUALLY...".  But no...regular ol' comment.
        I saw it okay among all the comments in the thread (BaconReader on mobile)
Make sure to knock things off of shelves and tables too.
[Removing all my posts and comments due to Reddit's fuckery with third party apps. June 2023]
Not sure why this is so downvoted. I can understand not everyone caring about fov sliders but as stated here it is important for some people. And tbh in 2022 tthey should be almost standard across the board considering how many years people have been complaining about a lack of fov sliders in games.
TotalBiscuit's spirit lives on. There is zero reason a game shouldn't have options for every effect the game has. Some games the effects don't bother me and others they are obnoxious.
I agree with you. Fov slider should be in every game by default. I was thinking buying this but if theres no fov option i wont. Im one of those people who get motion sickness when fov is too low cant play games with low fov. I will upvote you if it helps.
Makes me hopeful for a sequel, or even better, and more lengthy storyline. It wouldn’t even necessarily need to change the formula or assets up. Just more of what it’s already doing.
Ah, so it's the length of 1 run through a Dwemer ruins.
    its infinitely more fun though
It’s actually funny, there’s quite a bit of interesting story being presented and I was just running after a ball, pawing at it while they were talking about it. 

It’s very much a cat simulator lol
Feel your pain. I did the same, but for RDR2.
You're right people paid 60 for Death Stranding to deliver Amazon packages.
I've paid close to that for one meal, and more than half of that to see a movie. I'm not interested in this specific walking simulator, but I'm also not opposed to the idea in principle.
    Look at mister money bags over here
This is what happens when you are raised on mobile and free to play games.
Four hours in and no regrets.  I've spent more on visual novels.  Different strokes for different folks but this is a charming game. 

It's also not purely a walking sim. There's puzzles etc
$30 dollars is nothing for a decent game. Get a better job
    I can't get a better job. Can you gift me a copy since it's nothing to you?
I pay more than that to see a 1.5 hour movie at the cinemas, haha. So $30 for a beautiful, contained experience is no problem at all.
    I just upgraded the rest of my ps+ subscription for $15. So I can play Stray and whatever else on the list that I want to for the next 5 months
I never said they weren't allowed to dislike it, and since I haven't played the game I don't like or dislike it myself. What I tried to say was that their expectations were just ridiculous. It's like buying Bloodborne and being disappointed that the map size can't rival Ubisoft open-worlds.
Ok I will keep looking for sure
Honestly I expected the game to be much more like a Tenchu 3: Wrath of Heaven remake. There arent any katanas. There arent any grappling hooks. Not even so much as some rice. You cant kill for Lord Gohda. You cant even be a ninja. It's just so simple and empty.
Yes.

When my cat is wearing her backpack and solving puzzles around the house, I noticed she only jumps when a prompt come up.

100% realism confirmed.
So wait, you CAN jump?  Cause the person I replied said there's no jumping at all.
    My understanding is that jumping is a context button.

In other words, you can only jump when and where the game lets you.
        It feels like the Zipline and ledge grabbing in the Arkham games.
        You can jump onto most surfaces and platforms, its not a restrictive as you are making it seem
    What they meant was you can't just jump whenever you want. Stand next to ledge or a gap and a button prompt will appear on screen. Press the button and the cat does a jump to where the prompt was. 

I didn't buy the game but I agree with them it looks very limiting. Sure the way they've done it the animations look smooth and very realistic but I personally enjoy my freedom to hop around like an idiot in other games.
        Whenever you find yourself asking "Hey, it looks like I should be able to jump there, can I jump there?", the VAST majority of the time the answer is going to be yes. 

Jumping is a fundamental part of the game. I often found myself jumping to places that didn't even lead to anything. So it's not as if the only jumps you can make are the ones on the story path.
            I haven't played it. I'm waiting for actual reviews to come out instead of OMG CAT!!1! 

I'm glad you find it non limiting and open. Personally to me it looks very limited and I think the game probably just isn't for me. If you're enjoying it, more power to you.
    It's a canned animation. You push the button and it just does it for you. You don't aim it, you can't miss time it. That's probably what he means. It has jumping in the same way that one CoD game had respect paying. You push the button and the game plays itself. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing but a lot of people seemed to think this was gonna be a cat platformer.
    Technically yes, it's a big part of the game. It's odd but I think it fits very well with what the game is. I don't think a normal jumping system would fit with how the levels work.
This is sounding like a morbius situation, but I think people are doing it unironically, like they like the thought of a cat game and can't see any flaws with it. Is this game actually considered good or not?
    I'm throughly enjoying it and some of the "you  can't jump" comments are making me laugh cause it sounds like people expected cat parkour.

It's a linear story about a cat who is just chilling with their cat clan until they fall into a walled in city where all the humans are dead but robots remain.  

You find out what's going on by proceeding through the city. There's puzzles, memories and collectibles along the way. 

You can scratch things, meow your head off, trip a robot, rub against a robot,  break items etc. You have to not be nommed by half like looking bugs when you're not in robot city 

I'm four hours in and I'm throughly enjoying it so far cause I'm also looking for everything without a walk-through.

So, if you like that sort of thing then it's a good game for you. If not then no. But it's definitely a good game IMHO
    I think it's getting attention because it's different which is great. But from what I've gathered from other comments it's pretty and you can do a lot of cat stuff but except for specific circumstances it's pointless actions and it still feels lacking.
Well it's also a video game about a cat solving puzzles. Kinda weird to think the jumping system is fine because it's realistic when the entire premise of the game is fantasy.
    They are still trying simulate a real cat protagonist. Without the odd claw durability system and hunger meter that others wanted.
Lol true. I’m super happy with the game tbh. I played for hours yesterday and didn’t feel bored ever once.
The OP of the thread you're talking in said that.
You can’t just say perchance.
Ahhh thank you!!! I've recently gotten into modding my PS Vita and so I've become aware of the emulator named PPSSPP. 

I was very much confused.
    That's awesome  that you modded your Vita.  I have a modded PSP 3000.  It still has great games.

I didn't imply it wasn't a good game or that regular people weren't sharing posts about it. Someone asked why they were seeing it everywhere and I gave them the answer.
    I know. I just don't see this as really the effects of a terrific marketing team or anything like that. Just a byproduct of the internets love for cats.

You can never underestimate the power of the cat. And if you do, they will pounce on you and ruin your electronics because the stupid little bastard can't stop chewing on wires and....

.... Anyways yes, the answer is cats.
The first I heard of it was that big post a month or two ago. That explains things a bit!
You can turn the jump prompts off. It's pretty easy to tell what you can and can't jump on.
If you play with them (AKA  on the couch with them, on your phone while they play) it should be alright as there are some chase sequences that may be scary for a young child.


Other than that the main 'slums' area is basically a big playground if you aren't trying to solve puzzles or do quests.  Letting them play there would be fine.
    Thanks for the info, I appreciate it!
I'm halfway through the game, and there are a few chase scenes where you get swarmed by robotic insects. Some people might find that uncomfortable, especially children. I think it's pretty family friendly, though. If you get hit by a bug, it's not graphic, they just latch onto you. The cat can die if there are enough insects on you, but the screen just gets redder then fades to black. It's also obvious when you are in a dangerous area, and most of the game you are in a safe area, so you can take over the controller to handle the dangerous parts if your kids get too scared. Also, some of the robots are implied to curse, but it's censored ******.
Can’t you adjust the sensitivity on that? Or have you and it still frustrates you?
Hey I was playing the shareware version back then too, windows 3.1 machine with a whopping 25 MHz cpu. 😂

I have the snes rom and still go back and play it every couple years or so. Still fun.
    I loved blackthorn too!!
Interesting, I would argue the opposite :D. Inside is a larger project, but I've loved the journey in Limbo. It's a journey through life and while I wouldn't form that idea on my own, I've surely felt it while playing:

The boy died in the forest and awakens in limbo (the world between life and death). The soul can only get out of limbo when the body is properly buried. The boy continues through limbo until his sister finds and buries his body. In the ending scene, she is covering his grave.

Also, the whole journey is like a journey through life. Fear of spiders and water is overcome only to be replaced of the fear of bullying, character goes from forests to work environment and so on and so forth.

Anyways, the point is, I love Limbo because of that artistic overarching vision that guided the project. I was surprised that I didn't have that feeling with Inside.
I’ve come across one curtain to scratch up so far

I was thinking the same thing.  Comment was hidden, but didn't say it was below the score threshold.  Was assuming it was someone saying "ACKSHUALLY...".  But no...regular ol' comment.
    I saw it okay among all the comments in the thread (BaconReader on mobile)
its infinitely more fun though
Look at mister money bags over here
I can't get a better job. Can you gift me a copy since it's nothing to you?
I just upgraded the rest of my ps+ subscription for $15. So I can play Stray and whatever else on the list that I want to for the next 5 months
My understanding is that jumping is a context button.

In other words, you can only jump when and where the game lets you.
    It feels like the Zipline and ledge grabbing in the Arkham games.
    You can jump onto most surfaces and platforms, its not a restrictive as you are making it seem
What they meant was you can't just jump whenever you want. Stand next to ledge or a gap and a button prompt will appear on screen. Press the button and the cat does a jump to where the prompt was. 

I didn't buy the game but I agree with them it looks very limiting. Sure the way they've done it the animations look smooth and very realistic but I personally enjoy my freedom to hop around like an idiot in other games.
    Whenever you find yourself asking "Hey, it looks like I should be able to jump there, can I jump there?", the VAST majority of the time the answer is going to be yes. 

Jumping is a fundamental part of the game. I often found myself jumping to places that didn't even lead to anything. So it's not as if the only jumps you can make are the ones on the story path.
        I haven't played it. I'm waiting for actual reviews to come out instead of OMG CAT!!1! 

I'm glad you find it non limiting and open. Personally to me it looks very limited and I think the game probably just isn't for me. If you're enjoying it, more power to you.
It's a canned animation. You push the button and it just does it for you. You don't aim it, you can't miss time it. That's probably what he means. It has jumping in the same way that one CoD game had respect paying. You push the button and the game plays itself. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing but a lot of people seemed to think this was gonna be a cat platformer.
Technically yes, it's a big part of the game. It's odd but I think it fits very well with what the game is. I don't think a normal jumping system would fit with how the levels work.
I'm throughly enjoying it and some of the "you  can't jump" comments are making me laugh cause it sounds like people expected cat parkour.

It's a linear story about a cat who is just chilling with their cat clan until they fall into a walled in city where all the humans are dead but robots remain.  

You find out what's going on by proceeding through the city. There's puzzles, memories and collectibles along the way. 

You can scratch things, meow your head off, trip a robot, rub against a robot,  break items etc. You have to not be nommed by half like looking bugs when you're not in robot city 

I'm four hours in and I'm throughly enjoying it so far cause I'm also looking for everything without a walk-through.

So, if you like that sort of thing then it's a good game for you. If not then no. But it's definitely a good game IMHO
I think it's getting attention because it's different which is great. But from what I've gathered from other comments it's pretty and you can do a lot of cat stuff but except for specific circumstances it's pointless actions and it still feels lacking.
They are still trying simulate a real cat protagonist. Without the odd claw durability system and hunger meter that others wanted.
That's awesome  that you modded your Vita.  I have a modded PSP 3000.  It still has great games.
So now that you've had some time, what do you think of the zurks?
***meow***
That's not what's going on in the game. It's a dystopia world that has eldritch monsters in it.
It's really not that bad, they stick to you and then you fall over pretty much. There's no blood or anything. I'm just a huge cat lover and it bothered me to begin with lol
    She’s also a huge cat lover, that’s why she was concerned haha. Good to know she can get into it now!

    I did find a receipt for a joke toilet
        Has that ever happened to you?!

        It's just for farts
I feel like most people can bark. It's not hard to do. A lot of kids do it when they are playing around.
It's a 20 dollar dlc.
It's more of a puzzle game and less of an open world game. It's entertaining. I'm a couple hours in.
Sounds like there ought to be a hotkey that highlights jump points for a few seconds
I can see that for sure. I added a caveat to the last paragraph. My main point wasn’t about whether the traversal system was perfect, but about how the jump markers themselves don’t really make the game any better/easier and can probably be turned off.
    Yeah I got you, I just feel like I needed those jump markers at a couple spots. Either way, getting confused about where I could jump was rare and didn't ruin the game. Most of the time it was intuitive. I had the day off and got it for free with ps+ and it's been really fun. I would've been totally fine paying for the game.

        Cat.
I haven't played Untitled Goose Game, but the puzzles in Stray are quite straight forward. If in a small space, there are only a handful of options it could be at. In a bigger space, there are quite some "obvious" hints.
Yes. I played both and untitled goose game is more puzzles less story. Stray is far prettier and really sucks you into the world.
Yes they are
Yes. By a fair margin, too.
I love the art and the gameplay itself but man this game is incredibly easy. . I really like it but I honestly think a 19.99 price point is a bit more fair

You can never underestimate the power of the cat. And if you do, they will pounce on you and ruin your electronics because the stupid little bastard can't stop chewing on wires and....

.... Anyways yes, the answer is cats.
