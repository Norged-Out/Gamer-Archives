[[What is Stray's thememessage]]


I just finished it, beautiful game and superbly executed, but the overall story left me puzzled.

What was really the meaning behind all of that?

While the inciting event is the cat falling in the city, it's not really the main story here (and it's not properly resolved at the end either) but instead switches to the B12/humanity mystery & the companions who try to escape.

Both narrative threads are kinda confusing, what is the point at the end? It feels like the game wants to show us that B12's mission to carry humanity's memory was pointless and self-centered, that he must accept humanity is no more and leave the world to the next specy (companions).

But at the same time, companions repeatedly display selflessness and easily sacrifice themselves (and their life long quests) to help the cat forward, because the cat has better chances of making it through (which is true).

So, what is the message the player's supposed to take from this? That having hopes is useless and you should help others achieve their goals instead (and it may or may not benefit you too at the end) ?

Environmental destruction bad. Cat good.
I may be entirely wrong, but what I got from it was a message of hope that the robots would be able to flourish into a better humanity than the humans eventually became. 

The companions are like any sort of resistance group from stories. Think your typical teenage dystopian novel where all the characters just want their symbol of hope to survive. Stray becomes that symbol for the companions so they put themselves aside to get him up to the surface to prove that the robot species doesn't need to be trapped in an infinite loop waiting to be turned into scrap metal or eaten by the little pink things (I forget their name). 

B12 says something about it at the end, how he hopes that they do a better job than the humans did, and upon realizing that he in turn - the potentially last 'human' - sacrifices himself for the robots and their future, just as they did for him and Stray

Of course you could also say that deep down in their coding the robots were supposed to be assistants and would always put a human's (or a human's pet's) life first and B12 just happened to have a change of heart at the end, but that isn't quite as wholesome
Not every story has to have a deeper meaning or has to convey a certain message. It could be just that: A story.

In this case it is a story set in a world where humans retreated into domed cities probably because the outside environment wasn't livable anymore. Shit got bad, humans died out and what's left are robots whose AIs developed their own emotions.

Time went on, the outside got better, at least certain animals can live there again, one particualr cat accidentally falls down into one of the cities, meets a supposed AI who turns out to be a human conciousness that got uploaded in the network and the human helps the cat to reach the outside again.

That's it.
Cats are precious
It’s about coming together for the greater good, such as saving and helping people in need even if that means you have to sacrifice something, imo.

I think its also about the current situation of the earth and how we are destroying our own home.
It's about what comes after humanity. What we're doing now isn't destroying the world- others will survive. We're just destroying ourselves. With the companions trapped in the city, it's showing the world in a state where everything's frozen. What comes after can't flourish because of what humanity did in their desperation to hang onto power and survival.

It's B12's sacrifice that allows the world to move on. He opened the gates, yes, but his death itself represented the true end of humanitys desperate grasping for control over the world. People are not the beginning and ending of life on earth and behaving as if we are has consequences beyond ourselves
As a sociologist there were so many I seen.

I could write a thesis on it, it would be too long to write here. Definitely a great discussion starter in a course related to Liberation Sociology or any of the sort.

So many nuances, and coded messaging. It was super cool to play through carrying the lens that I do within sociology, social work, and being indigenous. 10/10 would play again.
    I would totally read a thesis on the sociology of Stray.
    Now I'm curious and would love to hear more. I won't ask you to write a thesis though. What's some coded messaging that maybe not everyone noticed?
        There’s a few I wrote down after I was done, I copied and pasted it here:

I noticed a lot of anti-capitalistic narratives.

The Companions (AI Robots) - were more sentient in the “slums” and ”midtown” areas, versus the robots near the “top of the wall”.

Also, how the sentinel robots (who were programmed by humans) keep the companions within the lower areas “in-check” by arresting, re-programming or erasing their hard drives (imprisonment and rehabilitation) if they question about the outside world (liberation).

I remember one robot saying, “we are fighting back against the processors”, which to me was similar to “the oppressors”.

Also how the slums were subjected to trash, and garbage of the upper areas, and the vast difference between the two locations (classism - in that we see this a lot within current society and Neighbourhoods within communities).

Just a few I can remember on the top of my head. I need to do another play through.
            I overheard the processors comments I think, and I never interpreted the level of sentience in regards to capitalism. The other stuff I thought was quite obvious, or at least I _hope_ it is, but you never know how people interpret this stuff. The erased robots in prison were genuinely heartbreaking.
                Yes! Also how fearful the imprisoned robots were to leave, while you (Stray cat) were opening the prison gates. 

I’m indigenous from what is called “Canada”, and my community was harshly subjected to colonization, and still on-going colonialism. I see a lot of internalized colonization beliefs, and colonial trauma within my community. The robots and their reactions to liberation and resistance really resonated with me that way.
                    I didn't even think of it in that light, it makes a lot of sense though. The robots live in a culture that isn't even their own, keeping up the remnants of an oppressive state that someone else put them in. The big difference of course, is that they didn't have their own culture then, and therefore got nothing they could return to, but they still clearly have their own identities. Especially their art and music really stuck out to me. Some of it human, some of it evolving into robot culture. It reminded me of how people, ripped out of their own cultural context for various reasons, start carving out new niches for themselves, how culture evolves to survive.
                        Absolutely! Also how in cultures that are subjected to colonialism/oppression will often have members internalize the ideologies of their oppressors and facilitate those oppressions towards their own.

In my community we call this “lateral violence”, which was picked up within the Indian act and residential schools systems. You’ll have members of your own community join the oppressing forces and oppress you through the same narratives and systems - hence the sentinels. 

I really love the culture aspect of the robots in creating their own liberation dialogue through music, art forms, culture, etc. especially with the outsiders as you’ll always have members within oppressed communities resist and speak on liberation through different areas (education, justice, groups, etc.). 

One thing that also stuck out to me was the hopelessness of some of the companions. “Oh that’s a really nice picture of the outside, too bad it’s fake”. And now hopelessness within oppression-related trauma can cause others to give up, lose hope, or become “living dead” (otherwise known as necropolitics). 

There’s so much that can be said about this amazing game. They did an awesome job.
                            Thank you so much for these insights! I loved the game, but my appreciation for it has deepened now. I also appreciate learning more about oppression from an indigenous perspective. As a European we don't hear much about that, despite our deep involvement we tend to act like these are purely American problems. Being on reddit and the internet in general I have a slightly better understanding of what it's like for Natives right now, but it's still wild that it was news to me as an adult. Growing up in Germany, we learn a _lot_ about the holocaust, yet never talked about what we did in Africa, or about colonisation in general. Much less how we're still involved, or how these things are connected. It's all well in the past to us.
                                Thank you for sharing and connecting! 

Canada and the US do a really great job at hiding the oppression they gain privilege and livelihood from. It’s an on-going survival process within indigenous nations under these occupations. We have our resistors, those who internalize, and those who struggle within survival mode (much like the companions).

There’s also speculation that Hitler gained inspiration of the Indian Act, and the Indian Removal Act of both Canada and the U.S and employed it in Europe. Here is an article that goes into it. https://indiancountrytoday.com/.amp/opinion/nazi-germany-and-american-indians

As an academic sociologist and social worker, I really connected so much to the game. I think I might write a little something on it and send it to my sociology professor. :)
Family
    Definitely. The robots were more family to Stray that the cats in the beginning who just left them there.
        ![gif](giphy|xVPosMMzT60Xzv31my)
Humans are arrogant when it comes to our choices that impact our earth and living. Even when everything was awful underground humans separated themselves by class and made living even harder. Even the things we made to eat the trash backfired and turned into Zurks. That’s atleast what I took away from it though, cat good robots good Zurk bad.
I think there's more than one theme or message. But the one that stuck out to me most were B12's efforts to save what's left of humanity, only to realise  it's pointless in the end. It was a stark reminder that this planet is not just ours, and it was a great contrast to all those movies where saving humanity is the whole point, even if there's barely anything left. Who would ever care about the last few memories of us? If we manage to drive ourselves to extinction, there's no one left to care. On a more personal level, it also reminded me how much we need. Our loved ones, our communities, they're what gives us, our memories, out legacies meaning. Humans mattered only for as long as B12 was around.

That was my takeaway, anyway.
Humanity does not equal Human
Press circle to meow
Highly, highly, highly recommend [this video](https://youtu.be/IZecrbWl6f0) for its take on the game's themes. It interprets Stray as an exploration of what it means to be a being with a mind very different from our own.

On one hand you have the robots, who are very different from humans, but they suffer in part because of the insistence on copying human behaviors even where it doesn't make sense - including social ones like the police/prison state of midtown, its social stratification vs. the impoverished slums, etc. - but also little things like going to a barber to cut hair they don't have, going to a bar even though they don't eat or drink, or staring at a TV with because they know that's supposed to be what humans did, but the TV has nothing on it. They haven't figured out their own way of living in the world yet. They copy humans because that's the only reference point they have for how to live, and because they feel obligated to preserve our traditions, but maybe that's not what's best for them. As a human you want to believe your culture will live on, but the game questions whether that has meaning when there are no humans around anymore. Our culture is very tightly adapted to what we are, so for robots who are something entirely different than human (when you look past the superficial resemblance), why shouldn't they have their own culture adapted to their bodies, needs, and ways of thinking?

On the other hand you have the cats, who live an essentially good life by being true to their own nature. By playing as a cat, you get to see the robots' human behaviors the way a cat sees human behaviors. Without the context of experiencing *what it's like to be a human*, which a cat or robot can never do, the things we do seem inscrutable. The robots are in the same position of not understanding, although they don't realize it.

The video goes into way more juicy detail and really digs into those ideas, and goes some places you probably don't expect.
That humanity was a mistake and only death/sacrifice can redeem us.
humans are gone, the future belongs to the robots. I don;t think there is a deeper meaning. There is some commentary about human nature, social class etc but that;s about it. 

"While the inciting event is the cat falling in the city, it's not really the main story here "

I agree. I always say that this game is about the robots. The cat is a way to tell their story.
I think it’s somewhat open to interpretation, but the message I took away from it is that life will find a way and we can all prosper if we work together. By helping the cat escape the city, the companions were able to be freed as well. Also, the fact that the companions are an extension of/what’s left of humanity. I strongly believe that all of the named companions are humans that were able to successfully upload their consciousness. So even if things aren’t quite like they were before, life still goes on and there is meaning to be found in the journey/friendships we make along the way.
Never lose hope, find a way to persevere and get it done.
maybe the message is that funny cat
The world will go on without us, though we will cast very long shadows.

The robots go through the motions of life in the city that they learned from us. Their society has a class structure of some robots oppressing others even though there's no practical reason for them to do so, but again, they learned that from us. Even the cat himself, as an orange tabby, is a human artifact: orange tabbies did not arise naturally from native cat species but were bred by the ancient Egyptians as their coloring was more pleasing as sacrifices to their gods, sadly.

The city is the crumbling, infested, stratified mess that we can't seem to stop ourselves from making. But in spite of all that, a cat will make it better.
Noticed the buzz/noise at the end of the game ?

The game's message , rather quesiton to the player is that are we really FREE?

It reminded me of how people, ripped out of their own cultural context for various reasons, start carving out new niches for themselves, how culture evolves to survive.
    Absolutely! Also how in cultures that are subjected to colonialism/oppression will often have members internalize the ideologies of their oppressors and facilitate those oppressions towards their own.

In my community we call this “lateral violence”, which was picked up within the Indian act and residential schools systems. You’ll have members of your own community join the oppressing forces and oppress you through the same narratives and systems - hence the sentinels. 

I really love the culture aspect of the robots in creating their own liberation dialogue through music, art forms, culture, etc. especially with the outsiders as you’ll always have members within oppressed communities resist and speak on liberation through different areas (education, justice, groups, etc.). 

One thing that also stuck out to me was the hopelessness of some of the companions. “Oh that’s a really nice picture of the outside, too bad it’s fake”. And now hopelessness within oppression-related trauma can cause others to give up, lose hope, or become “living dead” (otherwise known as necropolitics). 

There’s so much that can be said about this amazing game. They did an awesome job.
        Thank you so much for these insights! I loved the game, but my appreciation for it has deepened now. I also appreciate learning more about oppression from an indigenous perspective. As a European we don't hear much about that, despite our deep involvement we tend to act like these are purely American problems. Being on reddit and the internet in general I have a slightly better understanding of what it's like for Natives right now, but it's still wild that it was news to me as an adult. Growing up in Germany, we learn a _lot_ about the holocaust, yet never talked about what we did in Africa, or about colonisation in general. Much less how we're still involved, or how these things are connected. It's all well in the past to us.
            Thank you for sharing and connecting! 

Canada and the US do a really great job at hiding the oppression they gain privilege and livelihood from. It’s an on-going survival process within indigenous nations under these occupations. We have our resistors, those who internalize, and those who struggle within survival mode (much like the companions).

There’s also speculation that Hitler gained inspiration of the Indian Act, and the Indian Removal Act of both Canada and the U.S and employed it in Europe. Here is an article that goes into it. https://indiancountrytoday.com/.amp/opinion/nazi-germany-and-american-indians

As an academic sociologist and social worker, I really connected so much to the game. I think I might write a little something on it and send it to my sociology professor. :)
