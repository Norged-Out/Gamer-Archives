[[Batman Arkham Asylum is still a solid game in 2023]]


My son (three years old ) is on a bit of a Batman kick, and this is game that I somehow never got more than a couple of hours into years ago.  So I picked up the whole Return to Arkham collection to play through them finally.  When people talk about how well this game aged, they aren’t lying.  The story is great; I appreciate the more linear narrative instead of the open-world collectathon that infected gaming in the years following this game’s original release.  The UI is clunky.  The combat is mostly very easy button mashing; just press X over and over until you need to press Y to counter, occasionally throw a few batarangs, rinse and repeat.  It may seem dated, but that’s only because so many other games copied this formula and replicated it again and again (Assassin's Creed games being probably the most prominent example).  The graphics are still really very good.  Textures are sharp.  The art style is dark; everything is wet and miserable and cold.  The music does a great job of setting the tone.

I played this both on my Series S and my Series X.  Framerate with the Series X on a VRR screen was a smooth 45.  On the Series S, however, on a non-VRR screen it was definitely 30, and that can be pretty jarring going back and forth.

The last boss fight was some absolute bullshit, but maybe I just suck.

Solid game, especially for Batman fans.  8/10. 

Moving onto Arkham City next, though it's apparently locked at 30 FPS on both consoles.  😬  Will report back in like two or three months when I'm finally finished with it...lol


My fav of the four games. It’s atmosphere is unmatched imo
    It's so tight and claustrophobic which is perfect for batman. The you're locked in here with me!
        I have a pretty big pet peeve about not being able to go inside buildings in games if they’re there. Even if ifs unrealistic to expect that like in games like Arkham City or GTA 5 so Arkham Asylum really hits that perfect amount of the “map isn’t gigantic but you can explore every nook and cranny” feeling
            for the longest time there were two kinds of game levels, tunnels or walking over stuff.
            The beginning of this gave me Bloodborne flash backs. I HATE DECORATIVE DOORS
                Oh man there felt like so many doors that should matter in BB but they’re just places to knock on to hear an NPC groan lol
    Same. Really tightly designed. Great characters. Graphics are still beautiful. And it's more gothic in style than its sequels.
    My man. Still my favorite too. Most immersive. Best atmosphere. Less “video gamey” than later entries.
    Dont forget City has the best story, Origins is filled with amazing bossfights, and Knights gameplay is perfect
        Knights gameplay is half tank battles. The rest of it is good though.
        > Dont forget City has the best story

I thought the ending screwed that up, particularly as it pertained to hugo strange. Asylum also slightly dropped the ball narrative wise at the end imo, though its still my favourite of the Arkham series overall.   
Origins had the best story imo.
            I know but its a reference to a meme from the r/batmanarkham subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/BatmanArkham/comments/i8asxn/every_arkham_game_is_special_for_something/
                I loved it when this meme format got stealthily posted on other subreddits when Gotham Knights released. Same with the all the “do you agree with Batman’s no kill rule?” posts.
    I liked Asylum best as well.  The somewhat open world didnt do anything for me in the later games.
I'm jealous of your son, I can't convince my dad to try this, nor can I convince any friends to play the game.


City makes massive improvements to the gameplay of asylum. It's one of the biggest improvements I've seen a sequel do. It's a fantastic sequel and my favourite Arkham because it feels like the most well rounded.


Combat is more fluid with many more attack moves and combinations.

Bosses are actually pretty fun, one in particular is pretty iconic.

Movement and gliding feels way better.

Stealth encounters have more variety and depth.

Every gameplay aspect of asylum is just so much better in city.


Origins slightly regresses in these things and while Knight improves on City, its not as big a leap as city made from Asylum.



Arkham asylum is a classic and a masterpiece among superhero games. The small, enclosed environment of the asylum has this rich atmosphere, great pacing, memorable level design and a refreshing simplicity. Asylum just has this really special feel to it, and makes for such a memorable, replayable experience.  Out of all the games it feels the most like an issue of a comic or episode of the animated series. It's the one I come back to the most. 

The newer games go open world which changes a lot, and they have different atmosphere and tone from asylum (city comes the closest to asylum). There's this wonderful charm to asylum that has not been replicated. The biggest issue with asylum is that its gameplay while fun, is so outdone by the newer Arkham games.


 Even though there are many things in asylum I prefer over city, the gameplay of city just puts it ahead of asylum for me.



I would really like for asylum to get a remake that just brings the bosses and gameplay up to the standard of the sequels, while keeping everything else extremely faithful. I think asylum without the inferior gameplay would easily be the best batman game if not the best superhero game. It holds up well and doesn't need a remake, but I would love for its gameplay to be on par with Knights.
    Just played through City, which boss are you referring to that’s iconic?
        The guy in the police station, it's a beloved boss fight and widely seen as the best in the series. While it gets hyped up too much, it's still pretty fun and easily my favourite boss.
            Is it the Mr Freeze fight?
                Yeah
    Hard disagree on Origins. For me, it was far better than City:
        Nah. It's kinda underrated, and was better than asylum imo, but City is just better
            City is the worst of the franchise imo.
                Why?
                    The map is terrible. Doesn’t feel like a city, and is too small. Just feels like a weird, gamey, artificial world. I also hated how it was a horseshoe shape, just felt annoying to navigate. And the Riddler trophies appearing everywhere also feels too gamey for me. Also, for all the BS everywhere, it just felt like there was nothing to do. 

Origins fixed all of these problems. But more than anything, it just came down to the map. City is just too small. Origins makes me feel like I’m actually in Gotham. 

Asylum even feels bigger and more detailed than City. It’s a better map as well.
                        Absolute nonsense comment. Hard disagree with everything you said.
                            After rereading my own comment after 7 months, I think I'm on the money still.  City just doesn't hold up as well as the other games in the franchise.
I got the trilogy collection for PS4 super cheap a few months ago and played Arkham Asylum and thought it was really fun and looked good. I'll play Arkham City probably sometime in the next 6 months, but I usually take some time between playing similar games or sequels.
    >but I usually take some time between playing similar games or sequels

I had the same rule until I've started Yakuza 0 then played them all through 7 lol
        I played Yakuza 0 not long ago as well. At some point I'll have to play Kiwami.
            For me it quickly became my favorite series, I just love it so much, story, characters, gameplay, side content, all is top notch

edit. prepare for emotional trauma with Kiwami, I legit shed a tear, same goes for 6th one
                I was REALLY hooked with yakuza until I played 5
                    I loved 5 especially side jobs of MCs, loved Haruka part since I like rhythm / reflex games lol
                        I liked haruka's part! Way more interesting than shinada's and saejima's haha. It was a bit long tho

The rithm games were easy af tho. Never missed a button, but they were fun for awhile. 

> side jobs of MCs

Hated those, specially Saejima's. The hunting is boring and lackluster, and you spend lot of time there. I nearly drop the game in that section. I just wanted it to end to continue the plot. And shinada's part was the worst. His combat style sucks hard and his plot wasn't interesting

But Kiryu's and Akiyama's parts were awesome!
                            Yeah, shinada combat is not up to my alley too, didnt like weapon fighting even if it was good, taxi side job was fun asf and Saejimas hunting too, since I didnt rush it and was doing them from time to time, I needed it for 100% so I still finished it, now Im in finale of Judgment, mahjong is my opponent yet again... already 100%ed every game from 0-7
                                Woow you surely played them a lot for 100%

I usually just go to main missions, do some side ones, and barely do activities. Activities are fun but just a few times. I wanna fight people, not play mahjong or karts for hours

The stories are the main point in these games IMO, but Y5 was too bloated with filler activities that it turned me off personally

My favs are Zero (of course) Kiwami 2 and Y3. More than two protagonists is too much

Like a Dragon is awesome, but the combat bored me to death so I didn't completed it  :(
                                    I have like 800h spread across all games right now lol

Imho side content is as important in Yakuza as the story is, I've spent my fair share of time on just karaoke / dancing minigame and 0 is installed all the time so I just can hop on and play them lol

My favorite is probably 0 / 4 and I loved that we had more than 2 protags, especially when we got Akiyama, which is voice of protag from my favorite anime, so I already loved him, then there was Saejima, which also voiced protag in one of my favorite animes lol, the difference between fighting of Kiryu / Akiyama / Saejima / Tanimura didn't let me get bored and ultimately I wish we got Akiyama spin off lol
            Be prepared for a couple of rough transitions if you play the entire series. Y0 was made between 5 and 6 using a lot of what they learned along the way. Kiwami 1 and 2 are basically very high quality remakes of a PS2 games, but the writing and some other choices come from a time when the team was only finding their style and it kinda shows. Possibly worse is the jump to 3, which is a straight-up PS3 port with horrendously dated combat. A lot of people love it, but I personally think they must have played them when they were new or love the series so much that the critical part of their brain turns off. 

That being said, I heartily recommend the entire series! 4 and 5 are actually my favourites after 0 and 7 was great despite the different gameplay. Just finished that and about to start Judgement.
                > 4 and 5 

Those are my least favorites. Too many protagonists was a mistake IMO. The story is a mess, and they're way too overly bloated with content
        How does one get started in yakuza? Should I play through the games by order of release? Do the old ones still hold up?
    Arkham City is my favorite of the series. I felt it took Asylum and applied it to a larger area very well. I love flying around that city with the rain and lights.
Out of all the batman games, it aged the best IMO - especially in a modern world completely oversaturated with huge open world shit, the gothic survival horror vibe feels reaaally fresh
Game is high quality and rivals many current releases to this day.
[deleted]
    oh wow wish I knew about these when I replayed on PC a couple years ago but even without mods they held up incredibly well at 4K/60fps with all the settings cranked
I recently played through all 4 games on the Steam Deck. Arkham Knight and asylum are both genuine masterpieces. Hands down the best superhero games made. 

Asylum is so good as it's a narrow scope.
    Replaying them recently, I kind of prefer Asylum's limited scope. I mean, they're all great games, but the sequels, especially Knight, can feel overwhelmingly sprawling at times.
        Yeah, and there are way too many collectibles in City. I think there are twice as many Riddler trophies compared to Asylum, and Asylum felt like it was pushing it.

Origins and Knight backed off a bit, if I recall correctly, but City was insane.
            Knight had a stupid amount of Riddler trophies. It’s absurd. And they locked the full ending behind getting them all. I’m still mad lol. Not really, but it’s was really irritating. 

Asylum is my favorite.
                > Knight had a stupid amount of Riddler trophies. It’s absurd.

Knight only has three more trophies than Asylum does (243 to 240).

City on the other hand has 440.

Origins has an even 200, even if they aren't trophies.
                    Really?? It felt like A SHIT LOAD more. I don’t think they locked the story behind 100% in the earlier games, so maybe that’s why it felt so much more to me.
    I totally get why people get hung up on the Batmobile. But if people *could* look past it, the game is a 10/10 to me.

But again, I get it and wouldn’t ask people to look past it
        Luckily for me I'm an FPS player so I loved the batmobile lmao. I actually come back to Knight now and then just to play around with it more because I haven't found this gameplay elsewhere. Popping tanks with precise machine gun fire is immensely satisfying.

But yeah making every single bossfight a tank duel was kinda bad, not gonna lie.
        I also found the story to be incredibly disappointing
            I didn’t but I will give you the Arkham Knight being super stupid. Like “no no, it’s not who you think it is.”

Then “surprise, it’s who you think it is!”
                Yea I think it was how the person who was the knight was hardly mentioned in Asylum and City, so it felt painfully obvious.
                It teeters back and forth from great to dismal for me—Joker as a tag-along in Batman's head: Inspired. "Who is this mysterious masked man, the Arkham Knight?": Dumb as Hell. 

Also, they should've kept Asylum Scarecrow instead of stunt-casting Jonathan Noble. Dr. Crane apparently took a whole bottle of benzos between games.
                    Yeah I really don't know what they were thinking with the Arkham Knight, why hinge the story on a mystery villain and then have the reveal be someone the player has no emotional connection to? Those exposition flashbacks were an embarassing attempt to make it all run smoothly.
                        I just finished knight aside of a few last Riddler trophies and it’s a baffling game. A lot of it is best in the series, the levels are fantastic, the voice and production values shine through, Gotham feels more like Gotham than any other game, the mechanics are tuned and polished hard, the storytelling (not the story) is some of the best I’ve seen in games especially when it came out. You can tell the devs really love Batman.

But then there’s the Batmobile stuff which wouldn’t feel so bad but the boss battles/stealth in the tank was tonally off I thought and the story is real uneven. No fun Scarecrow stuff like in Asylum and the Arkham Knight is boring.
                            Yeah it's really frustrating, it could have been the peak of the series and really capped off their legacy but instead it's just another entry in the long list of awkward third instalments.  

It's a game that's well worth your time but I can't play it without getting hung up on what might have been.
            Don't forget the bosses
    Asylum reminds me of Die Hard, it’s a top 5 all time for me
    Were they a pain to get working on the Deck? I was going to play them there but saw you needed to do some finagling to get them working properly.
I played through the entire game up to the final battle without realizing you could use the directional arrows in combat. I played entirely with button presses.

I think in the final battle there were guys with guns maybe? Something that made me realize there must be a way of targeting specific enemies.

Make of that what you will lol...
    Could be worse, when I played Spiderman the first time I was like 14 and didn't level up at all. Completed the game with 1 skill upgrade
I mean why wouldn't it? Games from the 360/PS3 generation are mechanically and visually extremely similar to games from the current  generation so there isn't really any reason to think that highly acclaimed games from that era wouldn't still hold up.

It's similar to the surprise at Dead Space still being so good. Surprisingly little has changed in western AAA development since 2008 which is why so many of them are remastered and remade.
Lots of praise on the Arkham series here, and ever letter of it accurate. This is one of my favorite series of all time, likely enhanced further by my nostalgia for the 90’s animated series.

That said, if you enjoy the combat concept and the “celebration of the source material”-ness of these games, you will also love Insomniac’s Spider-Man (& Miles Morales).  Feels very much like a spiritual successor to Arkham, and very much stretches the same itch.
    Funny you should mention it.  I just finished up Miles Morales tonight!  My son loves those games as well!  He just likes to play out the action on screen and pretend like he's helping.  Those are phenomenal evolutions of the Arkham combat, and the cutscenes are wild!
I still play this game once every year or two. One of my all time favorites. The atmosphere is just perfect and I love the story and voice acting. Doesn't hurt that the combat is near perfect also.
>The combat is mostly very easy button mashing; just press X over and over until you need to press Y to counter, occasionally throw a few batarangs, rinse and repeat.

Yes and no. If you ever get into the challenges in any significant way you get bonus points per type of attack used, so you end up getting into a "string different attacks an abilities together in new and weird ass ways" situation.
Arkham games are definitely one of my favorite video game trilogies ever made.  Just wish Arkham Origins was more easily accessible on modern platforms as well.
I thought it was amazing when I played it around 2010. I also really liked Arkham City. Never played the other two as they looked pretty much the same to me honestly.
    Origins was basically a Ubisoft sequel to city, built as a filler game to tide over fans. It's pretty good for what it is but definitely a repeat of city.


Knight is different enough with the new artstyle, being in a different part of Gotham, having batmobile, and really expanding combat&stealth encounters. Not as good as City imo but not the same either. I'd recommend it.
        Thank you for the recommendation. I'll probably play Arkham Knight at some point, maybe Origins as well.
        I still wish Origins would've been included in the collection, though. I thought it was pretty good, except for that Deathstroke fight.
            It deserves more recognition. 

I'd take origins Deathstroke over the Deathstroke in knight anyday.
                Very true. Deathstroke boss fight? Tanks, but no tanks.
    If you got bored with them by City, I'd recommend against playing the others, as they very much are more of the same.
I do agree that it is a good game, and with your overall overview of it.

That being said:

> The combat is mostly very easy button mashing; just press X over and over until you need to press Y to counter, occasionally throw a few batarangs, rinse and repeat. It may seem dated, but that’s only because so many other games copied this formula and replicated it again and again (Assassin's Creed games being probably the most prominent example).

Two things here:

1) The Assassin's Creed games are a bit different in how their combat works than the Arkham-style combat; they are similar in some regards but the way combat flows is pretty different.

2) Assassin's Creed predates Arkham Asylum; Assassin's Creed 2 came out around the same time Batman: Arkham Asylum did.

I do agree that the AC and Arkham combat styles are overdone, but it's because they seem to work well until you put in boss fights, and then you realize that these systems don't really work then.
I played through this for the 3rd time about 1.5 years ago.  I 100% it this time.  Still a fantastic game, and still my favorite of the series.  Proof that open world isn't always better.
completed all the mission in Arkham Asylum few weeks ago, still can't get over how solid this game is. the atmosphere was really good and feels like a horror game. joker final boss, to me was the only problem.
Guess I'm the only one who couldn't really enjoy it. I got halfway through the game but I felt like there was no story. Just running around throughout the entire island without any real developments at all. There's never any big changes to Joker's plans, you get dripfed the tiniest of hints about the Venom stuff, but otherwise it's mostly just beating up baddies while chasing him around the island. Nor are there any meaningful character moments - 99% of the time you're off by yourself running through the hallways without interacting with anyone.
Wait till a remake comes out and kids go "ew the original looked so BAD lol" like they're doing with Dead Space.

These games are timeless.

    I honestly preferred the combat in Spiderman to the combat in Arkham. This isn't to say the Arkham combat is bad. It just never clicked with me. Spiderman's combat, however, was amazing and just worked for me.
How is it for a 3 year old? My daughter is into kingdom hearts right now, but not sure what to start up after that's over.

Also, is this the batman that had all the technical issues when it first came out?
    It's a brilliant game but pretty violent and even a bit creepy at times. It's set in an asylum for the criminally insane. Batman occasionally breaks the legs or arms of the thugs you fight. There is a serum that mutates people into monstrous brutes. There are some dark, hallucinatory sequences. Yeah, I think it would be a lot for a three year old.
    I’m genuinely curious, can kids that young really play games like this? I feel like I wouldn’t actually expect a three year old to be able to handle the controls on these games and make meaningful progress
        No. 3 year olds can't read, and their hands are too small.

My daughter can play the first few levels of Paw Patrol on a Roll, which is a simple 2d platformer that doesn't let the player lose. Anything else (including games like little big planet) is too difficult at the moment.
        I think the son's Batman kick is just what inspired OP to play the game. No way a three year old could effectively play AArkham Asylum.
    It can be really scary for a kid.

Talking dead bodies, morgue section.

Scarecrow and Killer Croc horror sections too. It can be a bit much.
    That was one of the other games in the series, I think Knight.

If you think that they're too intense for a three year old, I'd recommend checking out the Lego games. They're a ton of fun. I really enjoyed the Lego DC Super Villains game. Humble Bundle has Lego bundles somewhat frequently, if you're on PC.
        Concur on the Lego games.  My son loves those as well.
    As others have mentioned these games definitely aren't for a 3 year old. I would recommend Lego Batman and the other related Lego super hero games instead
Its not only a solid game, its the best game in the series.
One of my favourite games of all time. The atmosphere is so well done and I prefer the linearity over the open world gameplay in the sequels. I just really loved this game, its an example of perfect game design, and it's one of the very last games to come out of the 2000s. 

I haven't played it for about 10 years but have been considering picking up the collection myself.
Played it last summer and had a total blast. A+ game through and through.
Most games that have realised in the past 20 years and were "good" then are still "good" now
Also replaying it at the moment and it‘s amazing how much they got right the first time. While Arkham City and Knight refined the gameplay, the core was already rock solid from the get go. Especially combat, stealth, pacing and secrets were pretty perfect. Only thing that is jarring is the movement with walking often being too slow and running too fast.
Man that game was my childhood. Ive played it so many times that Ive done everything 3 times over and cant play it anymore just because Ive gotten so tired of it.
I skipped Asylum, but played City back in the day and loved it.  I thought Asylum would be a huge step back since it's only set in a little asylum and I just played in an entire city.  Finally got to Asylum when Epic gave it away and holy crap.  It is so damn good.  It holds up so well that it honestly didn't even feel like playing an older game.  Being more linear allows games to feel so much tighter and not clunky like City feels.
I remember playing this title back on PS3 and I absolutely loved it, despite not usually playing such games. I can even remember most of the boss fights and such as well - a very good game!
Man that game was absolutely mind blowing when I played it at around 12 years old
I picked this game up for $3on my PS3 and had a blast! Couldn’t stop playing until I got the platinum!
my brother who barley plays any video games raves about this game lol
Series S cant move this 2009 game at more than 30fps? Wow.
    It's also 30 on the Series X if you don't have a VRR screen, I believe.  It's not a matter of the hardware not being strong enough to do it.  If they would patch the game to unlock the framerate, I'm sure they would both hit 60.
I finished the game in one night. It was too fun.
Just here to say Asylum is awesome! Gameplay improved as the series progressed but the vibe of the first one was perfect! Loved it. 

I never got to play Arkham Knight! It’s on PS Plus so I’ve been thinking about giving it a go. I assume I won’t regret it.
It's still pretty fantastic today, and I say that as someone who nostalgia got zero hold on.  
Subsequent games are even better, though.
One of my fav game of all time
I picked these up recently, and it's next up in my solo game gueue after I'm done with Stray.  I'm getting kinda excited to start!
> Batman: Arkham Asylum is still a solid game in 2023 **(if you can get it to run properly)**

FTFY
Did you ever get around to city? It’s a fan favourite.
    Yes, briefly.  But then life got in the way.  Then deployment.  It's still on the back burner.
        Hope you enjoy it dawg! Have a good one!
It's so tight and claustrophobic which is perfect for batman. The you're locked in here with me!
    I have a pretty big pet peeve about not being able to go inside buildings in games if they’re there. Even if ifs unrealistic to expect that like in games like Arkham City or GTA 5 so Arkham Asylum really hits that perfect amount of the “map isn’t gigantic but you can explore every nook and cranny” feeling
        for the longest time there were two kinds of game levels, tunnels or walking over stuff.
        The beginning of this gave me Bloodborne flash backs. I HATE DECORATIVE DOORS
            Oh man there felt like so many doors that should matter in BB but they’re just places to knock on to hear an NPC groan lol
Same. Really tightly designed. Great characters. Graphics are still beautiful. And it's more gothic in style than its sequels.
My man. Still my favorite too. Most immersive. Best atmosphere. Less “video gamey” than later entries.
Dont forget City has the best story, Origins is filled with amazing bossfights, and Knights gameplay is perfect
    Knights gameplay is half tank battles. The rest of it is good though.

        I know but its a reference to a meme from the r/batmanarkham subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/BatmanArkham/comments/i8asxn/every_arkham_game_is_special_for_something/
            I loved it when this meme format got stealthily posted on other subreddits when Gotham Knights released. Same with the all the “do you agree with Batman’s no kill rule?” posts.
I liked Asylum best as well.  The somewhat open world didnt do anything for me in the later games.
Just played through City, which boss are you referring to that’s iconic?
    The guy in the police station, it's a beloved boss fight and widely seen as the best in the series. While it gets hyped up too much, it's still pretty fun and easily my favourite boss.
        Is it the Mr Freeze fight?
            Yeah
Hard disagree on Origins. For me, it was far better than City:
    Nah. It's kinda underrated, and was better than asylum imo, but City is just better
        City is the worst of the franchise imo.
            Why?
                The map is terrible. Doesn’t feel like a city, and is too small. Just feels like a weird, gamey, artificial world. I also hated how it was a horseshoe shape, just felt annoying to navigate. And the Riddler trophies appearing everywhere also feels too gamey for me. Also, for all the BS everywhere, it just felt like there was nothing to do. 

Origins fixed all of these problems. But more than anything, it just came down to the map. City is just too small. Origins makes me feel like I’m actually in Gotham. 

Asylum even feels bigger and more detailed than City. It’s a better map as well.
                    Absolute nonsense comment. Hard disagree with everything you said.
                        After rereading my own comment after 7 months, I think I'm on the money still.  City just doesn't hold up as well as the other games in the franchise.
>but I usually take some time between playing similar games or sequels

I had the same rule until I've started Yakuza 0 then played them all through 7 lol
    I played Yakuza 0 not long ago as well. At some point I'll have to play Kiwami.
        For me it quickly became my favorite series, I just love it so much, story, characters, gameplay, side content, all is top notch

edit. prepare for emotional trauma with Kiwami, I legit shed a tear, same goes for 6th one
            I was REALLY hooked with yakuza until I played 5
                I loved 5 especially side jobs of MCs, loved Haruka part since I like rhythm / reflex games lol
                    I liked haruka's part! Way more interesting than shinada's and saejima's haha. It was a bit long tho

The rithm games were easy af tho. Never missed a button, but they were fun for awhile. 

> side jobs of MCs

Hated those, specially Saejima's. The hunting is boring and lackluster, and you spend lot of time there. I nearly drop the game in that section. I just wanted it to end to continue the plot. And shinada's part was the worst. His combat style sucks hard and his plot wasn't interesting

But Kiryu's and Akiyama's parts were awesome!
                        Yeah, shinada combat is not up to my alley too, didnt like weapon fighting even if it was good, taxi side job was fun asf and Saejimas hunting too, since I didnt rush it and was doing them from time to time, I needed it for 100% so I still finished it, now Im in finale of Judgment, mahjong is my opponent yet again... already 100%ed every game from 0-7
                            Woow you surely played them a lot for 100%

I usually just go to main missions, do some side ones, and barely do activities. Activities are fun but just a few times. I wanna fight people, not play mahjong or karts for hours

The stories are the main point in these games IMO, but Y5 was too bloated with filler activities that it turned me off personally

My favs are Zero (of course) Kiwami 2 and Y3. More than two protagonists is too much

Like a Dragon is awesome, but the combat bored me to death so I didn't completed it  :(
                                I have like 800h spread across all games right now lol

Imho side content is as important in Yakuza as the story is, I've spent my fair share of time on just karaoke / dancing minigame and 0 is installed all the time so I just can hop on and play them lol

My favorite is probably 0 / 4 and I loved that we had more than 2 protags, especially when we got Akiyama, which is voice of protag from my favorite anime, so I already loved him, then there was Saejima, which also voiced protag in one of my favorite animes lol, the difference between fighting of Kiryu / Akiyama / Saejima / Tanimura didn't let me get bored and ultimately I wish we got Akiyama spin off lol
        Be prepared for a couple of rough transitions if you play the entire series. Y0 was made between 5 and 6 using a lot of what they learned along the way. Kiwami 1 and 2 are basically very high quality remakes of a PS2 games, but the writing and some other choices come from a time when the team was only finding their style and it kinda shows. Possibly worse is the jump to 3, which is a straight-up PS3 port with horrendously dated combat. A lot of people love it, but I personally think they must have played them when they were new or love the series so much that the critical part of their brain turns off. 

That being said, I heartily recommend the entire series! 4 and 5 are actually my favourites after 0 and 7 was great despite the different gameplay. Just finished that and about to start Judgement.
            > 4 and 5 

Those are my least favorites. Too many protagonists was a mistake IMO. The story is a mess, and they're way too overly bloated with content
    How does one get started in yakuza? Should I play through the games by order of release? Do the old ones still hold up?
Arkham City is my favorite of the series. I felt it took Asylum and applied it to a larger area very well. I love flying around that city with the rain and lights.
oh wow wish I knew about these when I replayed on PC a couple years ago but even without mods they held up incredibly well at 4K/60fps with all the settings cranked
Replaying them recently, I kind of prefer Asylum's limited scope. I mean, they're all great games, but the sequels, especially Knight, can feel overwhelmingly sprawling at times.
    Yeah, and there are way too many collectibles in City. I think there are twice as many Riddler trophies compared to Asylum, and Asylum felt like it was pushing it.

Origins and Knight backed off a bit, if I recall correctly, but City was insane.
        Knight had a stupid amount of Riddler trophies. It’s absurd. And they locked the full ending behind getting them all. I’m still mad lol. Not really, but it’s was really irritating. 

Asylum is my favorite.
            > Knight had a stupid amount of Riddler trophies. It’s absurd.

Knight only has three more trophies than Asylum does (243 to 240).

City on the other hand has 440.

Origins has an even 200, even if they aren't trophies.
                Really?? It felt like A SHIT LOAD more. I don’t think they locked the story behind 100% in the earlier games, so maybe that’s why it felt so much more to me.
I totally get why people get hung up on the Batmobile. But if people *could* look past it, the game is a 10/10 to me.

But again, I get it and wouldn’t ask people to look past it
    Luckily for me I'm an FPS player so I loved the batmobile lmao. I actually come back to Knight now and then just to play around with it more because I haven't found this gameplay elsewhere. Popping tanks with precise machine gun fire is immensely satisfying.

But yeah making every single bossfight a tank duel was kinda bad, not gonna lie.
    I also found the story to be incredibly disappointing
        I didn’t but I will give you the Arkham Knight being super stupid. Like “no no, it’s not who you think it is.”

Then “surprise, it’s who you think it is!”
            Yea I think it was how the person who was the knight was hardly mentioned in Asylum and City, so it felt painfully obvious.
            It teeters back and forth from great to dismal for me—Joker as a tag-along in Batman's head: Inspired. "Who is this mysterious masked man, the Arkham Knight?": Dumb as Hell. 

Also, they should've kept Asylum Scarecrow instead of stunt-casting Jonathan Noble. Dr. Crane apparently took a whole bottle of benzos between games.
                Yeah I really don't know what they were thinking with the Arkham Knight, why hinge the story on a mystery villain and then have the reveal be someone the player has no emotional connection to? Those exposition flashbacks were an embarassing attempt to make it all run smoothly.
                    I just finished knight aside of a few last Riddler trophies and it’s a baffling game. A lot of it is best in the series, the levels are fantastic, the voice and production values shine through, Gotham feels more like Gotham than any other game, the mechanics are tuned and polished hard, the storytelling (not the story) is some of the best I’ve seen in games especially when it came out. You can tell the devs really love Batman.

But then there’s the Batmobile stuff which wouldn’t feel so bad but the boss battles/stealth in the tank was tonally off I thought and the story is real uneven. No fun Scarecrow stuff like in Asylum and the Arkham Knight is boring.
                        Yeah it's really frustrating, it could have been the peak of the series and really capped off their legacy but instead it's just another entry in the long list of awkward third instalments.  

It's a game that's well worth your time but I can't play it without getting hung up on what might have been.
        Don't forget the bosses
Asylum reminds me of Die Hard, it’s a top 5 all time for me
Were they a pain to get working on the Deck? I was going to play them there but saw you needed to do some finagling to get them working properly.
Could be worse, when I played Spiderman the first time I was like 14 and didn't level up at all. Completed the game with 1 skill upgrade
Funny you should mention it.  I just finished up Miles Morales tonight!  My son loves those games as well!  He just likes to play out the action on screen and pretend like he's helping.  Those are phenomenal evolutions of the Arkham combat, and the cutscenes are wild!
Origins was basically a Ubisoft sequel to city, built as a filler game to tide over fans. It's pretty good for what it is but definitely a repeat of city.


Knight is different enough with the new artstyle, being in a different part of Gotham, having batmobile, and really expanding combat&stealth encounters. Not as good as City imo but not the same either. I'd recommend it.
    Thank you for the recommendation. I'll probably play Arkham Knight at some point, maybe Origins as well.
    I still wish Origins would've been included in the collection, though. I thought it was pretty good, except for that Deathstroke fight.
        It deserves more recognition. 

I'd take origins Deathstroke over the Deathstroke in knight anyday.
            Very true. Deathstroke boss fight? Tanks, but no tanks.
If you got bored with them by City, I'd recommend against playing the others, as they very much are more of the same.
I honestly preferred the combat in Spiderman to the combat in Arkham. This isn't to say the Arkham combat is bad. It just never clicked with me. Spiderman's combat, however, was amazing and just worked for me.
It's a brilliant game but pretty violent and even a bit creepy at times. It's set in an asylum for the criminally insane. Batman occasionally breaks the legs or arms of the thugs you fight. There is a serum that mutates people into monstrous brutes. There are some dark, hallucinatory sequences. Yeah, I think it would be a lot for a three year old.
I’m genuinely curious, can kids that young really play games like this? I feel like I wouldn’t actually expect a three year old to be able to handle the controls on these games and make meaningful progress
    No. 3 year olds can't read, and their hands are too small.

My daughter can play the first few levels of Paw Patrol on a Roll, which is a simple 2d platformer that doesn't let the player lose. Anything else (including games like little big planet) is too difficult at the moment.
    I think the son's Batman kick is just what inspired OP to play the game. No way a three year old could effectively play AArkham Asylum.
It can be really scary for a kid.

Talking dead bodies, morgue section.

Scarecrow and Killer Croc horror sections too. It can be a bit much.
That was one of the other games in the series, I think Knight.

If you think that they're too intense for a three year old, I'd recommend checking out the Lego games. They're a ton of fun. I really enjoyed the Lego DC Super Villains game. Humble Bundle has Lego bundles somewhat frequently, if you're on PC.
    Concur on the Lego games.  My son loves those as well.
As others have mentioned these games definitely aren't for a 3 year old. I would recommend Lego Batman and the other related Lego super hero games instead
It's also 30 on the Series X if you don't have a VRR screen, I believe.  It's not a matter of the hardware not being strong enough to do it.  If they would patch the game to unlock the framerate, I'm sure they would both hit 60.
Yes, briefly.  But then life got in the way.  Then deployment.  It's still on the back burner.
    Hope you enjoy it dawg! Have a good one!
I have a pretty big pet peeve about not being able to go inside buildings in games if they’re there. Even if ifs unrealistic to expect that like in games like Arkham City or GTA 5 so Arkham Asylum really hits that perfect amount of the “map isn’t gigantic but you can explore every nook and cranny” feeling
    for the longest time there were two kinds of game levels, tunnels or walking over stuff.
    The beginning of this gave me Bloodborne flash backs. I HATE DECORATIVE DOORS
        Oh man there felt like so many doors that should matter in BB but they’re just places to knock on to hear an NPC groan lol
Knights gameplay is half tank battles. The rest of it is good though.
> Dont forget City has the best story

I thought the ending screwed that up, particularly as it pertained to hugo strange. Asylum also slightly dropped the ball narrative wise at the end imo, though its still my favourite of the Arkham series overall.   
Origins had the best story imo.
    I know but its a reference to a meme from the r/batmanarkham subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/BatmanArkham/comments/i8asxn/every_arkham_game_is_special_for_something/
        I loved it when this meme format got stealthily posted on other subreddits when Gotham Knights released. Same with the all the “do you agree with Batman’s no kill rule?” posts.
The guy in the police station, it's a beloved boss fight and widely seen as the best in the series. While it gets hyped up too much, it's still pretty fun and easily my favourite boss.
    Is it the Mr Freeze fight?
        Yeah
Nah. It's kinda underrated, and was better than asylum imo, but City is just better
    City is the worst of the franchise imo.
        Why?
            The map is terrible. Doesn’t feel like a city, and is too small. Just feels like a weird, gamey, artificial world. I also hated how it was a horseshoe shape, just felt annoying to navigate. And the Riddler trophies appearing everywhere also feels too gamey for me. Also, for all the BS everywhere, it just felt like there was nothing to do. 

Origins fixed all of these problems. But more than anything, it just came down to the map. City is just too small. Origins makes me feel like I’m actually in Gotham. 

Asylum even feels bigger and more detailed than City. It’s a better map as well.

Then “surprise, it’s who you think it is!”
    Yea I think it was how the person who was the knight was hardly mentioned in Asylum and City, so it felt painfully obvious.
    It teeters back and forth from great to dismal for me—Joker as a tag-along in Batman's head: Inspired. "Who is this mysterious masked man, the Arkham Knight?": Dumb as Hell. 

Also, they should've kept Asylum Scarecrow instead of stunt-casting Jonathan Noble. Dr. Crane apparently took a whole bottle of benzos between games.
        Yeah I really don't know what they were thinking with the Arkham Knight, why hinge the story on a mystery villain and then have the reveal be someone the player has no emotional connection to? Those exposition flashbacks were an embarassing attempt to make it all run smoothly.
            I just finished knight aside of a few last Riddler trophies and it’s a baffling game. A lot of it is best in the series, the levels are fantastic, the voice and production values shine through, Gotham feels more like Gotham than any other game, the mechanics are tuned and polished hard, the storytelling (not the story) is some of the best I’ve seen in games especially when it came out. You can tell the devs really love Batman.

But then there’s the Batmobile stuff which wouldn’t feel so bad but the boss battles/stealth in the tank was tonally off I thought and the story is real uneven. No fun Scarecrow stuff like in Asylum and the Arkham Knight is boring.
                Yeah it's really frustrating, it could have been the peak of the series and really capped off their legacy but instead it's just another entry in the long list of awkward third instalments.  

It's a game that's well worth your time but I can't play it without getting hung up on what might have been.
Don't forget the bosses
It deserves more recognition. 

I'd take origins Deathstroke over the Deathstroke in knight anyday.
    Very true. Deathstroke boss fight? Tanks, but no tanks.
Oh man there felt like so many doors that should matter in BB but they’re just places to knock on to hear an NPC groan lol
I loved it when this meme format got stealthily posted on other subreddits when Gotham Knights released. Same with the all the “do you agree with Batman’s no kill rule?” posts.
Yeah
Why?
    The map is terrible. Doesn’t feel like a city, and is too small. Just feels like a weird, gamey, artificial world. I also hated how it was a horseshoe shape, just felt annoying to navigate. And the Riddler trophies appearing everywhere also feels too gamey for me. Also, for all the BS everywhere, it just felt like there was nothing to do. 

Origins fixed all of these problems. But more than anything, it just came down to the map. City is just too small. Origins makes me feel like I’m actually in Gotham. 

Asylum even feels bigger and more detailed than City. It’s a better map as well.
        Absolute nonsense comment. Hard disagree with everything you said.
            After rereading my own comment after 7 months, I think I'm on the money still.  City just doesn't hold up as well as the other games in the franchise.
I was REALLY hooked with yakuza until I played 5
    I loved 5 especially side jobs of MCs, loved Haruka part since I like rhythm / reflex games lol
        I liked haruka's part! Way more interesting than shinada's and saejima's haha. It was a bit long tho

The rithm games were easy af tho. Never missed a button, but they were fun for awhile. 

> side jobs of MCs

Hated those, specially Saejima's. The hunting is boring and lackluster, and you spend lot of time there. I nearly drop the game in that section. I just wanted it to end to continue the plot. And shinada's part was the worst. His combat style sucks hard and his plot wasn't interesting

But Kiryu's and Akiyama's parts were awesome!
            Yeah, shinada combat is not up to my alley too, didnt like weapon fighting even if it was good, taxi side job was fun asf and Saejimas hunting too, since I didnt rush it and was doing them from time to time, I needed it for 100% so I still finished it, now Im in finale of Judgment, mahjong is my opponent yet again... already 100%ed every game from 0-7
                Woow you surely played them a lot for 100%

I usually just go to main missions, do some side ones, and barely do activities. Activities are fun but just a few times. I wanna fight people, not play mahjong or karts for hours

The stories are the main point in these games IMO, but Y5 was too bloated with filler activities that it turned me off personally

My favs are Zero (of course) Kiwami 2 and Y3. More than two protagonists is too much

Like a Dragon is awesome, but the combat bored me to death so I didn't completed it  :(
                    I have like 800h spread across all games right now lol

Imho side content is as important in Yakuza as the story is, I've spent my fair share of time on just karaoke / dancing minigame and 0 is installed all the time so I just can hop on and play them lol

My favorite is probably 0 / 4 and I loved that we had more than 2 protags, especially when we got Akiyama, which is voice of protag from my favorite anime, so I already loved him, then there was Saejima, which also voiced protag in one of my favorite animes lol, the difference between fighting of Kiryu / Akiyama / Saejima / Tanimura didn't let me get bored and ultimately I wish we got Akiyama spin off lol
> 4 and 5 

Those are my least favorites. Too many protagonists was a mistake IMO. The story is a mess, and they're way too overly bloated with content
> Knight had a stupid amount of Riddler trophies. It’s absurd.

Knight only has three more trophies than Asylum does (243 to 240).

City on the other hand has 440.

Origins has an even 200, even if they aren't trophies.
    Really?? It felt like A SHIT LOAD more. I don’t think they locked the story behind 100% in the earlier games, so maybe that’s why it felt so much more to me.
