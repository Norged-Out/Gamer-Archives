[[Void chicken vs chicken]]


I know the void mayonnaise sells for more and that it's quite easy to hatch them once you have one... so would it be profitable to raise more void chickens instead of normal ones?


A void Chicken gives you an egg every day. Base price for void mayonnaise is 275. With a void chicken you could be making $1925 in that same time period. From a profitability standpoint chickens are the most profitable for the coop. Base price for chicken mayonnaise is $190 which you can make every day. And, you can get $1330 per week with chickens. The difference becomes more substantial as you become better friends with your chickens. So while chickens give you more money in the long run, void chickens give you more money in the short and medium run.
TLDR - normal chickens are slightly more profitable than void chickens, but you don't have to pet void chickens so they might be a better choice depending on your playstyle.

If you pet your chickens, they will be happy and produce large eggs. Large eggs make gold quality mayo (285g), which sell for a bit more than void mayo (275g). But that takes weeks, while void mayo doesn't depend on the quality of the void egg used, and can be produced right after the chicken matures.
While normal quality mayo is less, normal chickens eventually give you large eggs, which give gold star quality mayo. They are about the same money wise, so I just keep a bit of both for variety sake.
Yes, in fact that's what I usually do. The only problem is that you can't eat or cook with them.
I have only two of the void, my money is with the 6 dinos that always seem to have at least one egg ready to go each day.
    Iirc chickens produce slightly more per day than dinos (assuming max friendship), but not enough to be super important compared to e.g. how many pigs you have.
        going to go insane the next playthough, one coop for the normal chickens, one for the void chickens and one more for the dinos.
