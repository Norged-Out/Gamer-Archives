[[Why the hell did I bother fixing the community center]]


I don't think there's anything less impactful to the community than the community center. Obviously the main reason to help is to aid the Junimos, but what benefit has the CC had to the actual community?

No one goes there. I guess it's prettier? It's such a waste, it's in the core of the town and people walk by it every day, but I never see anyone there. Finishing the CC should open a monthly mini-event where villagers are holding some sort of community activity. Penny should teach Jas and Vincent here, in the area made specifically for kids. Willy should be stocking the aquariums with fish that change depending on the season. Pierre, Hat Mouse, and the Traveling Cart should have a farmer's market here every now and then. Maybe other vendors like Marion or the funky lil' bird that sells stuff on Ginger Island could join in.

It just seems like such a waste. What service is it actually doing to the community? At least a JOJA warehouse helps keep two members of the community employed and would stop Pierre from monopolizing. Why did they go out of business, anyway? Why did we get this massive movie theater that could hold twice our town's population instead of having a movie night at the Community Center?


there is a slight change in people's schedules, some do start using it regularly, but it's not obvious. 

I think all the noticeboards should move there, as well as the mayor's office, and lost and found. the Tuesday fitness group should start using the cc too
    Honestly, I was appalled when I found out the mayor's office didn't move.  The cc office is so much nicer than Lewis's living room.  Missed opportunity
        Hey, working from home is a valid option and should be considered over forcing people to move into empty buildings!
            Yeah, but Lewis having to walk to the park is not the same as having an hour commute through traffic
                It is the slow ass way everyone walks in this game
                    Yeah, I’m pretty sure the walk between Lewis’s house and the Community Center is somewhere between 30min to 1hr in game time (in walking speed). This town should invest in some bike racks.
                        Everyone has horses mod when?
                            it wouldn't work unless you updated every single person's schedule. and then all it would do is make it harder to meet them in between.
                                And Everyone as horse mod ?
                                    im pretty sure there’s pam horse mod
                It's Lewis... It would take him half a day to walk to the CC. And he'd be charging the taxpayers for the travel time.
                    With as many times as I’ve accidentally walked in on him asking people for tax money, I don’t doubt at all that you’re right lol
            He doesn't need to be there all the time, but having some guys house be the public records department is a little offputting. Does he just keep your marriage and divorce records in a box in his closet? Maybe once a week you see him carrying a box over followed by a chat with a random visitor in a professional setting?
            It wouldn’t need to be empty.. that’s the bummer. It could have had an art gallery, a schoolroom, anything to breathe life into the mindless tedium of the NPCs’ days. It could have triggered new festivals, new activities, anything. Pancake breakfasts once a month, or town hall meetings. It was a total white elephant. A bit of code could have made this an endlessly useful space.
    It would be neat if the Hat Mouse, Linus, the Wizard, Adventurers Guild, and maybe even Krobus had a day or couple of days each week where they fraternized with the rest of the community and you could buy from them/use their services (except for Linus).   

You would think that after doing all this work to unite the community, "the community" would be more than the people who were already neighbors and interacted with each other.
        Linus takes you into a special tent for a Wild Bait massage.
            that cutscene will stay with me forever
                *squish squish squish squish squish*
                    *shudders*
                Right?



So hot.
                    😧
                Wait—I'm full hearts with Linus, and I don't remember this ever happening??
            Wait, what?!?
                When you get there, just make sure you have your sound on. Loudly.
                    That sound will haunt my dreams forever.
                        *[wet thwacking sound intensifies]*
        Sounds like a farmers market which would be pretty cute
        Sandy too.
        Krobus having his own little 'night market' there would be cute (maybe even collaborating with the Dwarf here and there to try and make peace between their kinds)
    It is on Friday, *Clint!*

If you complete teh CC, he goes there on fridays - you don't just have 4pm to worry about. And somehow I always want something from him on Fridays.
        I wish he actually worked the forge there the same way you do in his regular forge.
            Right? What’s stopping him from opening them there 😭

It’d also be neat if unlocking the CC allowed for some neat tool upgrade because of the better forge.
        I hate his change in schedule. I always seem to need geodes opened on Fridays.
            Get enough hearts with him and he sends you a geode crusher and it's blueprints.
                Geode crusher is from his special orders board quest.
                I do have it but I feel like it's a waste of time and coal.
        Or on a day he goes to the Island.

*I'm also looking at you, Marnie.*
        I've seen Emily go in there one random time I was passing through
    I’m sorry but where tf is the lost and found?? I didn’t even know that existed!
        It's in the Mayor's house. I just don't really know the functionality of it.
            It's for stuff like if you leave your Grange display in the board after the fair or if you only ship like 55 out of the 100 needed of a quest from the big notice board.
            Also if you play multiplayer you can use it to access the contents of other players backpacks while they're offline
            Yeah I just googled it and it really looks like it has minimal use. I thought it might be like animal crossing where random items appear that you can take. Bummer.
                It's not random, items you contribute for the big request board go there if you fail to complete the request.
                It's necessary, though. I have some sort of bug, probably a mod problem, where sometimes a tool goes missing, and then I can get it back the next day from the mayor's office lost and found instead of being SOL without a hoe for the rest of the game!
                    If you manage to drop a tool or somehow "lose" it it can always be recovered the next day from lewis. However, this only applies to the standard tools and does not extend to things like a random sword you obtained as mob loot.
            It's for stuff like if you leave your Grange display in the board after the fair or if you only ship like 55 out of the 100 needed of a quest from the big notice board.
        If u put items into a collection box for a quest from the quest board and don't end up completing it, it'll appear in lost and found the next day
    Oh I like how you think, kiddo
    Second this! This is a fantastic idea and I had no idea that people use the CC regularly.
    I do get annoyed when people say “no one uses it” because they do! It’s not a huge noticeable thing but when I’m trying to get everyone to max hearts I notice it a lot more. Jodi and Caroline will go there and sit in the chairs, Maru and Emily will go the craft room, Lewis goes to the office, Clint goes to the furnace room and Gus goes to the kitchen. It’s annoying when I can’t remember their schedules anymore lol but they do use it!

I do agree it would be nice if it was more obvious, like maybe Penny bringing the kids to the craft room or the aerobics class happening there.
    If you ever wondered where Lewis disappears too, he's generally here. Staring at the bulletin board or vault.
    That would be so funny to have the mayors office move in immediately! Gee thanks for cleaning the place up for me farmer!
Maybe thats the new event in the update??? Something with the community center! :)
    That would be AMAZING! Such a good idea!
    tbh im really hoping for a community center event * a ginger island one would be SICK thi
    I keep hoping there are more cutscenes and opportunities to be had at the CC with each update!
It fell into disrepair because nobody cared about it anyway. So, it didn't really surprise me that nobody cared about it after it was fixed, either.
    if you go the joja route a few of them bitch and moan about it

but like.. bruh, it was abandoned. And technically *Lewis* is the one who sold it to Joja. I'm sorry that he's trying to guilt me about it but I refuse to take responsibility for his mistakes.

This is why his shorts are going on a signpost in town. Right next to the gold statue.
        Not to mention like a third of the town loses their jobs
            We should be able to hire some of them. Sam needs to spend a summer picking strawberries to build some character.


Spring. Shit. Point stands.
                I would pay so much money for people to water for me. Beach farm game changer
                    Oh yes, it would be so nice!!
                The junimo could pick the fruits and vegetables and sam could replant them for me. I'll pay better than joja if he makes the seeds with the seed maker too.
                Sam works at Jojamart / The Library if Jojamart is closed.
            Our town drunk has more time to dedicate to raising his special blue chickens, which are an excellent moneymaker. And Skater boy said see you later boy, just to become a superstar playing the hottest venues in Zuzu City. Clair got herself a new job at the movie theater, which somehow provided a better work/life balance and allowed her to pursue her dreams of being an actress.
        Plus, Lewis has money for golden statue of HIMSELF, but not to fix the CC?
        [deleted]
            No. You don't miss out on anything.  In the Joja route, Joja decides to turn the old community center/warehouse into the new theater.

The junimos are free because the buildings aren't abandoned anymore, and the wizard still gives you the spell for Junimo huts.
I did it SOLELY because I hate Morris even more than I hate Clint and wanted to stop getting notes in the mail all the time that a Joja representative charged me $1k for taking my unconscious body back to my house.
    TRUE. I once passed out on my front step and got charged by Joja for it. Never will I do a Joja run
So Evelyn can get away from George for a little each week.
    She already gardens outside almost everyday.
        She needs somewhere to go when it rains! 
And George and Jody’s husband could go to occupational therapy together
        And ?
That is true. The CC is nothing remarkable in Vanilla. At least in SVE, we get a community day. The whole town goes to the CC on the 22nd of each season. *A good way to earn quick friendship with everyone.* 

The driving force that the CC has over Joja is the journey, not the end result. It's recommended in your very first run because it's portrayed as a challenge. That feeling of accomplishment knowing that you didn't buy your way out of a terrible situation is what makes the CC worth it. 

It's also a message that you stood tall against the very thing that destroyed you. The thing that made you give up your old life in place of the new. Facing adversity head on and giving everything you've got.
    That last part is the key point I think
        That the Farmer is absolutely broken at the start of the game is a core reason for coming back to it. 

That, and Yoba-damnit I planted my strawberries a tile too far over and now I gotta wait for them to give me one more harvest before building that barn. 

Might as well start a new day...
    I view it kind of like a tutorial. To get all the items you need to utilise the full range of skills available and explore all the areas you can access, experiment with fishing in different seasons, encourage farming a wide variety of crops and animals and go a significant way down the mine. It's a way of showing all the key things you can do in the game in a fairly controlled way
        Yeah, and the conpletetion of bundles and unlocking of stuff gives more of a progression/achievement style game play otherwise it would be a more sandbox game.
        Yeah, as a game mechanism I think it's good.
    I could so easily afk one of the slot machines and spend a few million qi coins on hardwood fences and make BANK and easily do the joja one

But cc is funner+ better rewards
        Lol I've played like 5 different saves, and in each one I've done the CC. I enter Joja maybe once or twice per save, and I've only ever bought anything once, in my first save.

I'm not letting some pasty corporate bootlicker take credit for my truffle and wine empire.
            Pierre takes credit for it instead!
    It's such a shame without mods that few use the CC
    All important points, and I just wanna add a small one: the small rewards for individual bundles helped me in my first playthrough in seeing how useful they were (looking at you seedmaker).
    Take a poor man's gold, your last two paragraphs are why the community center exists in its base form in the first place. 🥇
    I could have sworn this was in vanilla. The Mandela Effect has stalked me for years at this point.
Yeah you got a point. Some do go there, I can't remember exactly when but Clint goes on Fridays, some of the older ladies go have some kinda book club (not that their dialogue reflects this), pretty sure Emily goes once 

But events would be super fun!
    Gus goes too!
Aw! a movie night at the community centre would've been a really cute idea!
    A theater gets put in place when you complete the bundles in the closed joja mart.
        A theatre group at the CC!
Why in the world did Robin put her special orders bulletin board in front of Lewis’ house, when there already was a community board in the community center?!
    From programming standpoint: to make sure, even the joja minions could use it. From the logical standpoint you're absolutely right. One would have more reason to use the cc than to march over to Luis and more people would see it. Plus, it's closer to your farm.
    Would you rather walk uphill and enter the cc just to see the board, or walk past it from time to time as you're moving around town?
        Uphill both ways! In the driving snow!
Other things around the town change because you've helped restore the town in a sense as well. Pierre's is open on wednesdays, Willy unlocks his back room so you can repair the boat to unlock Ginger Island (whole new map, zone, etc), and I believe there are other options like upgrading the townspeoples home (giving Pam a house) and the Joja center you can turn into a movie theater.
    All of that except Pierre's opening on Wednesdays happens on Joja route too.
        I am currently doing a Joja run and got the key to the town from Ginger Island. I went into Pierre's on a Wednesday and he was standing behind the counter, so I was able to buy from him anyway.
            Even on his day off he just stands there harping about stocking up on seeds. pierre has no life
        oh fair, I've never done Joja route so far lol
The Joja route is soooo much easier to get an auto-petter.
    Also way easier to get the greenhouse before first winter.
People regularly visit it lol , I even had to wait an extra day to get my watering can back cause clint visits it every friday
    Yeah, that was always annoying, forgetting that your upgrade would finish on Friday
I did community center just to spite Joja. No other reason 🤣 why would I build the very thing my character walked away from at the jump? The fact there were cameras in each of the cubicles disturbed me enough to go "nope not giving Joja anything" and I never spent a single gold there.
This post is brought to you by the board members of Joja Mart. Your one stop shop! Who needs a community center when you can have a sprawling parking lot for your local Joja mart! Come shop now!
I've never done Joja. It's kinda of like Undertale: I've never done any other route than true pacifist, even before I knew what I was doing.

It feels wrong for me to do it any other way.
Slight change/s to villagers schedule however I feel like it's a " tutorial" on the skills you can learn as a new player 

Each bundle teaches you about a aspect of the game
It's like putting a shopping cart in the return area. You only do it because it's the right thing to do.
Because we need a goal.
There's a reason it was abandoned and in disrepair in the first place
Hehe

Welcome to Joja

Thrive
I do wish more of them went there more often. ConcernedApe DID say he's adding another festival, so maybe he can do something with it.

I assume part of the issue is he did not want to too heavily make people feel they missed out if they go the Joja route.
There should be veterans' group therapy sessions for Kent to attend.
    AA for Shane and Pam, too 👀
I think the CC is a perfect way for people to get used to the game and see all aspects of the items etc. And I'm super glad I did it on my first play, however I've never done it again since. I'll take Joja from now on. So much faster and easier and less stressful
I couldn't even use the oven or sewing machine! Not surprised no one uses it!
Everyone uses it. 😂

You obviously haven’t been inconvenienced by Clint spending his entire Friday staring at the furnace.
I do it for the junimos and Willy
Honestly, I take the CC route out of guilt and guilt alone. There's nothing in it for me, but I'm very anti-capitalism, so I dont want to give in to Joja. That's it though. I really only do it for the moral high ground
I actually hate the community center. the only person who seems to go there is fucking CLINT. that douchebag is always abandoning work to go frolic around the cc like he gets paid to do it or something
    🤣 what’s wrong with Clint?
        everything. even the way he stands is upsetting
        He’s a creep! Why is he so obsessed with Emily? She clearly does not feel the same way and instead of moving on, he just continues to creep. Team Clint sucks ftw!
            Tbh he doesn’t creep too bad. He never said anything bad about Emily or how he feels entitled to her love. He’s just sad and shy guy who doesn’t know any better. 
And to move on where? All bachelorettes in this town are fucking teenagers.
Way bigger creep is Harvey who is 2 times older than Maru and still looking for a chance to “apply sunscreen” on her.
            Like it's his fault time doesn't really move in SDV except for crops.
            Actually it's *not* clear how Emily feels about Clint. Clint can't express himself and Emily seems oblivious to how he feels.
            I am not team Clint. I was just curious 😁
            Except when he finally asked her out, she said yes
                Somehow I don't think she understood it as a date.
    lol he only goes there once a week
        that's once a week too many
I know there’s going to be a 1.6 update. But yeah the community center needs to be redone to where it’s used for things.
    Hopefully he makes it so there is more use out of the CC.
[deleted]
    He's not exclusive to completing the community center
I stopped doing community center runs during modded play throughs, I just want to get to the modded content as fast as possible lol
The automatic animal petter being only accessible from completed Joja ( and maybe some chests if lucky ) is my biggest regret with the CC
All excellent reasons why I now go Joja.

I'm happy that I did the CC first, it was a really good way to explore and learn the game, but my next save was a Joja save.

Whichever route you pick,>! you can get a cinema later - in the former Joja by completing another bundle, or in the former CC by paying Joja for it. I think the cinema is best in the CC, and at least people go to that!!<
how long has it been since you fixed it? people go there constantly haha :)
me reading this after prioritizing the community center because it *seemed* important 🥲 (I’m newish to the game)
    For what it's worth, some of the unlocks with the CC are nice to have
        What are they?
            Like the minecart
                Joja route gets all those community upgrades, you just pay for them.
                    That's a good point and definitely an option. I haven't personally done a Joja route yet
                What about when you complete it though? I remember the junimos are good to help you harvest…
                    To be honest I've only completed it once or twice and I stopped playing the run shortly after. I don't really remember what happens when you fully complete it. I just like some of the smaller rewards and I like the challenge of managing my time throughout the year. As someone else mentioned, you could go the Joja route and you can get the same rewards, you just have to pay money for them.
    for a first playthrough completing the CC is a good way to learn all aspects of the game. the rewards for each bundle also help you progress in the game.

after the first few times, yeah Jojo route is easier.
If you're on PC:

1. Community Center Reimagined by LemurKat, gives people loads more to do there. It has bits for LemurKat's custom NPCs but you don't have to have them installed: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6966

2. Stardew Valley Expanded, of course. It adds regular community days https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3753

3. Community Wednesdays, which adds fun little events on a Wednesday. I hear the mod author is a really cool guy. https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16966
    Lol @ Noonsa.
He is indeed!
Honestly I just hate the big blue Joja warehouse lol. But the only time I find it useful is in the expanded version on PC, so much more fun cause they actually go into the center on either Monday or Wednesday I can’t remember which but they hang out in there and it’s useful to talk with people in one area instead of running all over finding them lol.
People go there all the time and enjoy it.
Right? I really thought it would become a bit of a focal point and change some dynamics. But no...people kinda hang out there sometimes. That's all.
JoJo pathway is actually super nice. First time doing it this play through and having a blast having everything open right away. 

Movie theater at that location is better too imo.
Could pack it full of anti social npc playing bingo on bingo night, open mic night, public access troupes, weird self help groups ala the Simpson / family guy / fight club (weave in some plot lines easily), misc learn how to classes, etc.

I would love to program it, I would hate to be there :)
Join Joja and thrive :)
It really does feel like a waste which is such a shame since it’s so pretty and is hyped up so much. Some people go there from time to time but honestly it felt more annoying because then when I needed Clint to be working, he’d be at the CC. Not as bad as Marnie though, I guess my man needs a break once in awhile.
You get a lot of cool free shit from completing bundles. (And you buy some cool shit from one bundle.) Plus you can watch Morris get punched in the face!

That's pretty much the only gameplay reason why anybody would complete it over doing the Joja route.
Finishing the bulletin board bundles gives you extra hearts with the townspeople so that's kinda good I guess?
Wrong! Clint goes there every Friday and essentially fucks you out of seeing him every Friday! Joja is clearly the superior choice, because fuck Pierre.
One of my biggest gripes to be honest.
Joja should move in
Well, I am so close to finish it and i even been so desperate to do so that now I've read this I want to cry.
Clint every Friday
Register for Joja before submitting the last item for CC.
enjoy the journey not the destination 💯
Right?! My boyfriend did it within a year, I'm like wtf I'm going the evil route lol!
This is possibly the most disappointing thing in sdv for me. I always thought he'd change something to give it more of an impact. Given that's like the ONLY thing for me to be disappointed about is pretty cool.
Was this post written by JOJA?
    Morris made, Joja approved.
This is why I like Joja Route. The warehouse can eventually be replaced by the movie theater which I prefer its placement over the cc route. And Joja stays open so you can buy seeds on Wednesday.
    Pierre is open on Wednesdays after the CC is complete so that point is moot.
        Oh is he? I wouldn’t know. Neat.
        It 100% won't matter after you get the keys to the town.
            Yeah but that's end game content.
                Lbr though, the only notable differences between Joja and Pierre are that Pierre carries saplings, ferts, and a few low-end seeds like the Y2s and rice,  and that he sells them for cheaper. They're nothing that a factory farming farmer would plant en masse.
                    Bold of you to assume I don't plant like 100 red cabbage every summer.
    Eventually the local market stays open on Wed as well
Well. How do you think it fell in disrepair in the first place? Not cause people were using it, thats for sure.

lol
Yeah I was complaining about exactly this today. You’d think its completion would at least trigger a new festival or series of activities. Nope. All that time just for the NPCs to stand inside of it staring at random objects for hours. It could even have been a school. So much could have been done with it.
Oh people go there alright, but it's only ever on days you really wish they were manning their stores.
i unlocked the greenhouse, mining cart and bus stop via CC route. The rest I just purchased via Joja. I don't really care about moral dilemma, Joja provide jobs and pierre should innovate his business. Lewis isn't doing his job well. Leah and Gunther have the potential to attract tourist to valley.
This is why i go down the JOJA route with most farms now. Not only is it quicker to complete (usually done by winter unless im doing a challenge) its also more usable afterwards. If the CC had some interactions with it then it would be more worth it. I barely see anybody in there also.

I wish though with JOJA that the seeds became cheaper or have sales on different ones every day if you go down that route. Would make it more interesting
    I thought JoJa was evil?

Edit: I’m on spring, year two and repairing the CC. I’ve finished 2 or 3 rooms and I love the jujimos.
        I can't morally get myself to do a Joja run. I know it's a game, but when he goes into Pierre's talking trash it pisses me off and I get stuck doing a CC run out of annoyance.
            Lol i love when he goes in talking trash to Pierre cause ngl, im not a fan of Pierre. Caroline could do SO MUCH better (ie: me. She could do me 😏🤣)
                Maybe there's a mod for that 🤣🤣
        It is meant to be "evil" 😅 which is also why i get slaughtered by stardew players whenever i mention i do JOJA routes 🤣🤣🤣

But also, ive not been a fan of Lewis especially after he was a dick to Sam  so i much rather go against his wishes 😈
            Interesting! I like games where you can go dark. But lately I’ve been all about doing good. I might try going corporate on my next farm 😈
                You will kick yourself at how easy a Joja run seems. A handful of kegs and everything's upgraded by fall year 1.
                    I go the tea sapling route myself 😅
                You definitely should! Especially once you've gotten through your first farm a bit more, and get the tricks down of making early money (alot of tips out on youtube on how to).

If you play on PC there are some great JOJA mods out there too 🤣 i plan to do them soon and go full corporate 😈
They claim to appreciate what we do for the town but it’s all just talk.
In Stardew Valley Expanded there is a Community Day on the 22nd of each month where everyone visits the CC.
To unlock the quarry,  repair the mine carts, bus stop and greenhouse 🤷

I liked it because those kinds of challenges are what makes the game fun (I get so excited when I find the thing I'm looking for) but yeah, it kinda seems weird that you can't use the stuff in there. The dye pots would be handy and maybe if there was a recipe book in the kitchen or something.
    You can get greenhouse in early summer with joja wdym
Literally describing part of the Stardew valley expanded mod. Gotta get it my dude! Join us. Thrive. (lol jk but srsly sounds like you'd love the mod)
    I made a deal with myself that I'd get that mod when I finish 100% completion on my current vanilla playthrough, which I'm very close to!
Also by restoring the community center you get the bus back, minecarts, etc, which are super helpful for the community! Let Pam work!
    Do you not get these by going the joja route?
        you do, and it's easier lmao
            Lol I actually did not know this, I’ve only ever done the community center. Welp, there goes my work ethic.
                You just have to pay to get all the things unlocked if you do the Joja route. The only thing you pay for by completing the CC is the vault. The vault is 42,500, and completing all of joja cost you 135,000 to unlock everything.
Also all the shit you unlock while finishing it is the point as well it gets you to do eveyrthing the game has to offer
Has anyone tried upgrading the community center all except for one bundle and then selling out to Joja to get the theater and having a bit of both worlds? I’ve read about it but I’m still on my first play through and have been going the CC route
    You get the theater in both options
achievement
lmao is this how you see Walmart?
The SDV Expanded there is a community center day each seasons where everyone gathers at the CC for a day but it's nothing special
That's why i love playing PC now. SDV expanded has much more going on at the center. Love community day on the 22nd!
Obviously so you can fix the boat to go to ginger island and never come back here!
Ginger island
    You can access it by completing the Joja route, too.
It gives you a bunch of tools that help you, like minecarts, panning, having Pierre’s open on Wednesdays, unlocking community upgrades with Robin which gives you shortcuts around town, rewards, etc. It’s completely worth it.
    Joja does all those and allows you to buy late night seeds and autopetters
        Yeah but then the community center is *really* useless
I do it so I can get the movie theater bundle and spend every first Friday in a movie with someone
Jojo route is best route.
I agree with all of this.
Yeah the community centre is the most underused thing in the game. I’ve been planning to go Joja route for my next playthrough for this reason.
Are you on PC? There is a nice mod that increases the community interaction. After 4k hours though, it was a bit confusing looking for people at first lol.
Could have easily been a good opportunity for the while town. School area for the kids, area for the gym ladies, worship (stuff so pierre and Caroline and abby can get the privacy of their home back in terms of that part of the building, and as you said market days or something
You can only get to ginger island after finishing the community center, so i always see ginger island as the reward for finnishing the community center. If viewed that way, completing the community center gives you access to so much new content like quests, fishing locations, characters, a new “mine” and exploration. I took so long to finish the community center and was so supprised by the ammount of content that was on ginger island that i wished i had completed the community center earlyer.
The only reasons is to get the rewards and unlock the island
Yeah, I think it’s disappointing the community centre doesn’t actually do anything once you fix it. Seems so obvious to make it somehow… central to the community… in some way…

I’d have done that before adding birdnuts island.
Fully agree. It's mostly there just for the sake of having completion goals tbh. I hate running to mods for everything but I vaguely remember a mod that does just what you suggested. No festivals but I believe everyone starts actually using the CC regularly
I dunno, I think the unlocks from doing the community center (the greenhouse and junimo harvesters on the farm) are pretty worth it. And you do get a lot of villagers in the center on Saturdays that makes for a wholesome spot to socialize once a week.
I agree, there definitely needs to be more after you finish the community center. I would love to see more community action in there, it feels so empty.
Maybe we're getting something like this as the ???? update coming in 1.6?
I hate having the community center open. I always forget Clint goes there every Friday, so I can't get my geodes cracked.
Idk why u say no one goes there. Every fucking time. Every Single Fucking time I'm like "oh i should go crack this geode or upgrade this tool" Clint is in the fckn CC. Also Evely, Jodi and Caroline go there a lot. I think Lewis goes too. It's just not everyday. But yeah there's a mod that adds block parties in the CC every last Friday or something like that and its a good opportunity to go gift ppl without being trapped by a festival. It should be implemented in the vanilla game imo
I took the joja route when I almost finished the CC cause I couldn't bother to fish lmao but I regret it cause there's nothing special about the movie theatre either.. I guess it's just a little part of the gameplay that doesn't evolve as good as u would think it will either way
I agree I like all the stuff that comes with fixing it (greenhouse, carts, bus, etc.) but the community center itself does seem a bit useless
You can open the theater after you ruin jojos business too
You can always go the Joja route 😂 but killing the magic feels sad 🫠
Ginger Islands
Honestly, I was appalled when I found out the mayor's office didn't move.  The cc office is so much nicer than Lewis's living room.  Missed opportunity
    Hey, working from home is a valid option and should be considered over forcing people to move into empty buildings!
        Yeah, but Lewis having to walk to the park is not the same as having an hour commute through traffic
            It is the slow ass way everyone walks in this game
                Yeah, I’m pretty sure the walk between Lewis’s house and the Community Center is somewhere between 30min to 1hr in game time (in walking speed). This town should invest in some bike racks.
                    Everyone has horses mod when?
                        it wouldn't work unless you updated every single person's schedule. and then all it would do is make it harder to meet them in between.
                            And Everyone as horse mod ?
                                im pretty sure there’s pam horse mod
            It's Lewis... It would take him half a day to walk to the CC. And he'd be charging the taxpayers for the travel time.
                With as many times as I’ve accidentally walked in on him asking people for tax money, I don’t doubt at all that you’re right lol
        He doesn't need to be there all the time, but having some guys house be the public records department is a little offputting. Does he just keep your marriage and divorce records in a box in his closet? Maybe once a week you see him carrying a box over followed by a chat with a random visitor in a professional setting?
        It wouldn’t need to be empty.. that’s the bummer. It could have had an art gallery, a schoolroom, anything to breathe life into the mindless tedium of the NPCs’ days. It could have triggered new festivals, new activities, anything. Pancake breakfasts once a month, or town hall meetings. It was a total white elephant. A bit of code could have made this an endlessly useful space.
It would be neat if the Hat Mouse, Linus, the Wizard, Adventurers Guild, and maybe even Krobus had a day or couple of days each week where they fraternized with the rest of the community and you could buy from them/use their services (except for Linus).   

You would think that after doing all this work to unite the community, "the community" would be more than the people who were already neighbors and interacted with each other.
    Linus takes you into a special tent for a Wild Bait massage.
        that cutscene will stay with me forever
            *squish squish squish squish squish*
                *shudders*
            Right?



So hot.
                😧
            Wait—I'm full hearts with Linus, and I don't remember this ever happening??
        Wait, what?!?
            When you get there, just make sure you have your sound on. Loudly.
                That sound will haunt my dreams forever.
                    *[wet thwacking sound intensifies]*
    Sounds like a farmers market which would be pretty cute
    Sandy too.
    Krobus having his own little 'night market' there would be cute (maybe even collaborating with the Dwarf here and there to try and make peace between their kinds)
It is on Friday, *Clint!*

If you complete teh CC, he goes there on fridays - you don't just have 4pm to worry about. And somehow I always want something from him on Fridays.
    I wish he actually worked the forge there the same way you do in his regular forge.
        Right? What’s stopping him from opening them there 😭

It’d also be neat if unlocking the CC allowed for some neat tool upgrade because of the better forge.
    I hate his change in schedule. I always seem to need geodes opened on Fridays.
        Get enough hearts with him and he sends you a geode crusher and it's blueprints.
            Geode crusher is from his special orders board quest.
            I do have it but I feel like it's a waste of time and coal.
    Or on a day he goes to the Island.

*I'm also looking at you, Marnie.*
    I've seen Emily go in there one random time I was passing through
I’m sorry but where tf is the lost and found?? I didn’t even know that existed!
    It's in the Mayor's house. I just don't really know the functionality of it.
        It's for stuff like if you leave your Grange display in the board after the fair or if you only ship like 55 out of the 100 needed of a quest from the big notice board.
        Also if you play multiplayer you can use it to access the contents of other players backpacks while they're offline
        Yeah I just googled it and it really looks like it has minimal use. I thought it might be like animal crossing where random items appear that you can take. Bummer.
            It's not random, items you contribute for the big request board go there if you fail to complete the request.
            It's necessary, though. I have some sort of bug, probably a mod problem, where sometimes a tool goes missing, and then I can get it back the next day from the mayor's office lost and found instead of being SOL without a hoe for the rest of the game!
                If you manage to drop a tool or somehow "lose" it it can always be recovered the next day from lewis. However, this only applies to the standard tools and does not extend to things like a random sword you obtained as mob loot.
        It's for stuff like if you leave your Grange display in the board after the fair or if you only ship like 55 out of the 100 needed of a quest from the big notice board.
    If u put items into a collection box for a quest from the quest board and don't end up completing it, it'll appear in lost and found the next day
Oh I like how you think, kiddo
Second this! This is a fantastic idea and I had no idea that people use the CC regularly.
I do get annoyed when people say “no one uses it” because they do! It’s not a huge noticeable thing but when I’m trying to get everyone to max hearts I notice it a lot more. Jodi and Caroline will go there and sit in the chairs, Maru and Emily will go the craft room, Lewis goes to the office, Clint goes to the furnace room and Gus goes to the kitchen. It’s annoying when I can’t remember their schedules anymore lol but they do use it!

I do agree it would be nice if it was more obvious, like maybe Penny bringing the kids to the craft room or the aerobics class happening there.
If you ever wondered where Lewis disappears too, he's generally here. Staring at the bulletin board or vault.
That would be so funny to have the mayors office move in immediately! Gee thanks for cleaning the place up for me farmer!
That would be AMAZING! Such a good idea!
tbh im really hoping for a community center event * a ginger island one would be SICK thi
I keep hoping there are more cutscenes and opportunities to be had at the CC with each update!
if you go the joja route a few of them bitch and moan about it

but like.. bruh, it was abandoned. And technically *Lewis* is the one who sold it to Joja. I'm sorry that he's trying to guilt me about it but I refuse to take responsibility for his mistakes.

This is why his shorts are going on a signpost in town. Right next to the gold statue.
    Not to mention like a third of the town loses their jobs
        We should be able to hire some of them. Sam needs to spend a summer picking strawberries to build some character.


Spring. Shit. Point stands.
            I would pay so much money for people to water for me. Beach farm game changer
                Oh yes, it would be so nice!!
            The junimo could pick the fruits and vegetables and sam could replant them for me. I'll pay better than joja if he makes the seeds with the seed maker too.
            Sam works at Jojamart / The Library if Jojamart is closed.
        Our town drunk has more time to dedicate to raising his special blue chickens, which are an excellent moneymaker. And Skater boy said see you later boy, just to become a superstar playing the hottest venues in Zuzu City. Clair got herself a new job at the movie theater, which somehow provided a better work/life balance and allowed her to pursue her dreams of being an actress.
    Plus, Lewis has money for golden statue of HIMSELF, but not to fix the CC?
    [deleted]
        No. You don't miss out on anything.  In the Joja route, Joja decides to turn the old community center/warehouse into the new theater.

The junimos are free because the buildings aren't abandoned anymore, and the wizard still gives you the spell for Junimo huts.
TRUE. I once passed out on my front step and got charged by Joja for it. Never will I do a Joja run
She already gardens outside almost everyday.
    She needs somewhere to go when it rains! 
And George and Jody’s husband could go to occupational therapy together
    And ?
That last part is the key point I think
    That the Farmer is absolutely broken at the start of the game is a core reason for coming back to it. 

That, and Yoba-damnit I planted my strawberries a tile too far over and now I gotta wait for them to give me one more harvest before building that barn. 

Might as well start a new day...
I view it kind of like a tutorial. To get all the items you need to utilise the full range of skills available and explore all the areas you can access, experiment with fishing in different seasons, encourage farming a wide variety of crops and animals and go a significant way down the mine. It's a way of showing all the key things you can do in the game in a fairly controlled way
    Yeah, and the conpletetion of bundles and unlocking of stuff gives more of a progression/achievement style game play otherwise it would be a more sandbox game.
    Yeah, as a game mechanism I think it's good.
I could so easily afk one of the slot machines and spend a few million qi coins on hardwood fences and make BANK and easily do the joja one

But cc is funner+ better rewards
    Lol I've played like 5 different saves, and in each one I've done the CC. I enter Joja maybe once or twice per save, and I've only ever bought anything once, in my first save.

I'm not letting some pasty corporate bootlicker take credit for my truffle and wine empire.
        Pierre takes credit for it instead!
It's such a shame without mods that few use the CC
All important points, and I just wanna add a small one: the small rewards for individual bundles helped me in my first playthrough in seeing how useful they were (looking at you seedmaker).
Take a poor man's gold, your last two paragraphs are why the community center exists in its base form in the first place. 🥇
I could have sworn this was in vanilla. The Mandela Effect has stalked me for years at this point.
Gus goes too!
A theater gets put in place when you complete the bundles in the closed joja mart.
    A theatre group at the CC!
From programming standpoint: to make sure, even the joja minions could use it. From the logical standpoint you're absolutely right. One would have more reason to use the cc than to march over to Luis and more people would see it. Plus, it's closer to your farm.
Would you rather walk uphill and enter the cc just to see the board, or walk past it from time to time as you're moving around town?
    Uphill both ways! In the driving snow!
All of that except Pierre's opening on Wednesdays happens on Joja route too.
    I am currently doing a Joja run and got the key to the town from Ginger Island. I went into Pierre's on a Wednesday and he was standing behind the counter, so I was able to buy from him anyway.
        Even on his day off he just stands there harping about stocking up on seeds. pierre has no life
    oh fair, I've never done Joja route so far lol
Also way easier to get the greenhouse before first winter.
Yeah, that was always annoying, forgetting that your upgrade would finish on Friday
AA for Shane and Pam, too 👀
🤣 what’s wrong with Clint?
    everything. even the way he stands is upsetting
    He’s a creep! Why is he so obsessed with Emily? She clearly does not feel the same way and instead of moving on, he just continues to creep. Team Clint sucks ftw!
        Tbh he doesn’t creep too bad. He never said anything bad about Emily or how he feels entitled to her love. He’s just sad and shy guy who doesn’t know any better. 
And to move on where? All bachelorettes in this town are fucking teenagers.
Way bigger creep is Harvey who is 2 times older than Maru and still looking for a chance to “apply sunscreen” on her.
        Like it's his fault time doesn't really move in SDV except for crops.
        Actually it's *not* clear how Emily feels about Clint. Clint can't express himself and Emily seems oblivious to how he feels.
        I am not team Clint. I was just curious 😁
        Except when he finally asked her out, she said yes
            Somehow I don't think she understood it as a date.
lol he only goes there once a week
    that's once a week too many
Hopefully he makes it so there is more use out of the CC.
He's not exclusive to completing the community center
For what it's worth, some of the unlocks with the CC are nice to have
    What are they?
        Like the minecart
            Joja route gets all those community upgrades, you just pay for them.
                That's a good point and definitely an option. I haven't personally done a Joja route yet
            What about when you complete it though? I remember the junimos are good to help you harvest…
                To be honest I've only completed it once or twice and I stopped playing the run shortly after. I don't really remember what happens when you fully complete it. I just like some of the smaller rewards and I like the challenge of managing my time throughout the year. As someone else mentioned, you could go the Joja route and you can get the same rewards, you just have to pay money for them.
for a first playthrough completing the CC is a good way to learn all aspects of the game. the rewards for each bundle also help you progress in the game.

after the first few times, yeah Jojo route is easier.
Lol @ Noonsa.
He is indeed!
Morris made, Joja approved.
Pierre is open on Wednesdays after the CC is complete so that point is moot.
    Oh is he? I wouldn’t know. Neat.
    It 100% won't matter after you get the keys to the town.
        Yeah but that's end game content.
            Lbr though, the only notable differences between Joja and Pierre are that Pierre carries saplings, ferts, and a few low-end seeds like the Y2s and rice,  and that he sells them for cheaper. They're nothing that a factory farming farmer would plant en masse.
                Bold of you to assume I don't plant like 100 red cabbage every summer.
Eventually the local market stays open on Wed as well
I thought JoJa was evil?

Edit: I’m on spring, year two and repairing the CC. I’ve finished 2 or 3 rooms and I love the jujimos.
    I can't morally get myself to do a Joja run. I know it's a game, but when he goes into Pierre's talking trash it pisses me off and I get stuck doing a CC run out of annoyance.
        Lol i love when he goes in talking trash to Pierre cause ngl, im not a fan of Pierre. Caroline could do SO MUCH better (ie: me. She could do me 😏🤣)
            Maybe there's a mod for that 🤣🤣
    It is meant to be "evil" 😅 which is also why i get slaughtered by stardew players whenever i mention i do JOJA routes 🤣🤣🤣

But also, ive not been a fan of Lewis especially after he was a dick to Sam  so i much rather go against his wishes 😈
        Interesting! I like games where you can go dark. But lately I’ve been all about doing good. I might try going corporate on my next farm 😈
            You will kick yourself at how easy a Joja run seems. A handful of kegs and everything's upgraded by fall year 1.
                I go the tea sapling route myself 😅
            You definitely should! Especially once you've gotten through your first farm a bit more, and get the tricks down of making early money (alot of tips out on youtube on how to).

If you play on PC there are some great JOJA mods out there too 🤣 i plan to do them soon and go full corporate 😈
You can get greenhouse in early summer with joja wdym
I made a deal with myself that I'd get that mod when I finish 100% completion on my current vanilla playthrough, which I'm very close to!
Do you not get these by going the joja route?
    you do, and it's easier lmao
        Lol I actually did not know this, I’ve only ever done the community center. Welp, there goes my work ethic.

        It's Lewis... It would take him half a day to walk to the CC. And he'd be charging the taxpayers for the travel time.

Lol I've played like 5 different saves, and in each one I've done the CC. I enter Joja maybe once or twice per save, and I've only ever bought anything once, in my first save.

I'm not letting some pasty corporate bootlicker take credit for my truffle and wine empire.
    Pierre takes credit for it instead!
A theatre group at the CC!
Uphill both ways! In the driving snow!
I am currently doing a Joja run and got the key to the town from Ginger Island. I went into Pierre's on a Wednesday and he was standing behind the counter, so I was able to buy from him anyway.
    Even on his day off he just stands there harping about stocking up on seeds. pierre has no life
oh fair, I've never done Joja route so far lol
everything. even the way he stands is upsetting
He’s a creep! Why is he so obsessed with Emily? She clearly does not feel the same way and instead of moving on, he just continues to creep. Team Clint sucks ftw!
    Tbh he doesn’t creep too bad. He never said anything bad about Emily or how he feels entitled to her love. He’s just sad and shy guy who doesn’t know any better. 
And to move on where? All bachelorettes in this town are fucking teenagers.
Way bigger creep is Harvey who is 2 times older than Maru and still looking for a chance to “apply sunscreen” on her.
    Like it's his fault time doesn't really move in SDV except for crops.
    Actually it's *not* clear how Emily feels about Clint. Clint can't express himself and Emily seems oblivious to how he feels.
    I am not team Clint. I was just curious 😁
    Except when he finally asked her out, she said yes
        Somehow I don't think she understood it as a date.
that's once a week too many
What are they?
    Like the minecart
        Joja route gets all those community upgrades, you just pay for them.
            That's a good point and definitely an option. I haven't personally done a Joja route yet
        What about when you complete it though? I remember the junimos are good to help you harvest…
            To be honest I've only completed it once or twice and I stopped playing the run shortly after. I don't really remember what happens when you fully complete it. I just like some of the smaller rewards and I like the challenge of managing my time throughout the year. As someone else mentioned, you could go the Joja route and you can get the same rewards, you just have to pay money for them.
Oh is he? I wouldn’t know. Neat.
It 100% won't matter after you get the keys to the town.
    Yeah but that's end game content.
        Lbr though, the only notable differences between Joja and Pierre are that Pierre carries saplings, ferts, and a few low-end seeds like the Y2s and rice,  and that he sells them for cheaper. They're nothing that a factory farming farmer would plant en masse.
            Bold of you to assume I don't plant like 100 red cabbage every summer.
I can't morally get myself to do a Joja run. I know it's a game, but when he goes into Pierre's talking trash it pisses me off and I get stuck doing a CC run out of annoyance.
    Lol i love when he goes in talking trash to Pierre cause ngl, im not a fan of Pierre. Caroline could do SO MUCH better (ie: me. She could do me 😏🤣)
        Maybe there's a mod for that 🤣🤣
It is meant to be "evil" 😅 which is also why i get slaughtered by stardew players whenever i mention i do JOJA routes 🤣🤣🤣

But also, ive not been a fan of Lewis especially after he was a dick to Sam  so i much rather go against his wishes 😈
    Interesting! I like games where you can go dark. But lately I’ve been all about doing good. I might try going corporate on my next farm 😈
        You will kick yourself at how easy a Joja run seems. A handful of kegs and everything's upgraded by fall year 1.
            I go the tea sapling route myself 😅
        You definitely should! Especially once you've gotten through your first farm a bit more, and get the tricks down of making early money (alot of tips out on youtube on how to).

If you play on PC there are some great JOJA mods out there too 🤣 i plan to do them soon and go full corporate 😈
you do, and it's easier lmao
    Lol I actually did not know this, I’ve only ever done the community center. Welp, there goes my work ethic.
        You just have to pay to get all the things unlocked if you do the Joja route. The only thing you pay for by completing the CC is the vault. The vault is 42,500, and completing all of joja cost you 135,000 to unlock everything.
Yeah but then the community center is *really* useless
Yeah, but Lewis having to walk to the park is not the same as having an hour commute through traffic
    It is the slow ass way everyone walks in this game
        Yeah, I’m pretty sure the walk between Lewis’s house and the Community Center is somewhere between 30min to 1hr in game time (in walking speed). This town should invest in some bike racks.
            Everyone has horses mod when?
                it wouldn't work unless you updated every single person's schedule. and then all it would do is make it harder to meet them in between.
                    And Everyone as horse mod ?
                        im pretty sure there’s pam horse mod
    It's Lewis... It would take him half a day to walk to the CC. And he'd be charging the taxpayers for the travel time.
        With as many times as I’ve accidentally walked in on him asking people for tax money, I don’t doubt at all that you’re right lol
He doesn't need to be there all the time, but having some guys house be the public records department is a little offputting. Does he just keep your marriage and divorce records in a box in his closet? Maybe once a week you see him carrying a box over followed by a chat with a random visitor in a professional setting?
It wouldn’t need to be empty.. that’s the bummer. It could have had an art gallery, a schoolroom, anything to breathe life into the mindless tedium of the NPCs’ days. It could have triggered new festivals, new activities, anything. Pancake breakfasts once a month, or town hall meetings. It was a total white elephant. A bit of code could have made this an endlessly useful space.
that cutscene will stay with me forever
    *squish squish squish squish squish*
        *shudders*
    Right?



So hot.
        😧
    Wait—I'm full hearts with Linus, and I don't remember this ever happening??
Wait, what?!?
    When you get there, just make sure you have your sound on. Loudly.
        That sound will haunt my dreams forever.
            *[wet thwacking sound intensifies]*
Right? What’s stopping him from opening them there 😭

It’d also be neat if unlocking the CC allowed for some neat tool upgrade because of the better forge.
Get enough hearts with him and he sends you a geode crusher and it's blueprints.
    Geode crusher is from his special orders board quest.
    I do have it but I feel like it's a waste of time and coal.
It's for stuff like if you leave your Grange display in the board after the fair or if you only ship like 55 out of the 100 needed of a quest from the big notice board.
Also if you play multiplayer you can use it to access the contents of other players backpacks while they're offline
Yeah I just googled it and it really looks like it has minimal use. I thought it might be like animal crossing where random items appear that you can take. Bummer.
    It's not random, items you contribute for the big request board go there if you fail to complete the request.
    It's necessary, though. I have some sort of bug, probably a mod problem, where sometimes a tool goes missing, and then I can get it back the next day from the mayor's office lost and found instead of being SOL without a hoe for the rest of the game!
        If you manage to drop a tool or somehow "lose" it it can always be recovered the next day from lewis. However, this only applies to the standard tools and does not extend to things like a random sword you obtained as mob loot.

We should be able to hire some of them. Sam needs to spend a summer picking strawberries to build some character.


Spring. Shit. Point stands.
    I would pay so much money for people to water for me. Beach farm game changer
        Oh yes, it would be so nice!!
    The junimo could pick the fruits and vegetables and sam could replant them for me. I'll pay better than joja if he makes the seeds with the seed maker too.
    Sam works at Jojamart / The Library if Jojamart is closed.
Our town drunk has more time to dedicate to raising his special blue chickens, which are an excellent moneymaker. And Skater boy said see you later boy, just to become a superstar playing the hottest venues in Zuzu City. Clair got herself a new job at the movie theater, which somehow provided a better work/life balance and allowed her to pursue her dreams of being an actress.
No. You don't miss out on anything.  In the Joja route, Joja decides to turn the old community center/warehouse into the new theater.

The junimos are free because the buildings aren't abandoned anymore, and the wizard still gives you the spell for Junimo huts.
Pierre takes credit for it instead!
Even on his day off he just stands there harping about stocking up on seeds. pierre has no life
