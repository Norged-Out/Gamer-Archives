[[A little respect for Grandfather]]





Well now I feel bad because my shrine is part of a chicken pasture stuck behind a coop... But I love yours üòÄ
    It's what gramps would have wanted.
        He always loved those chickens
            ...maybe a little too much.
                That explains the feather growing on my butt once in a while
                    And why I can‚Äôt help but slam my face into any seeds I see.
        All gramps wants is you to be happy
            Been very very depressed these few days, and this made me cry.
        that's what I think too. I came here to say that about mine- that corner is fenced off for my animals to graze in
    Haha yeah, my shrine is overgrown with trees! I have to hack my way to it.
    Mine is behind my cow barn so I get that feeling
    ü§£ I guess, grandpa blew the candles out right away!
        Gramps is all ‚ÄúFkn ingrate. I‚Äôm taking my statue of perfection with me.‚Äù
    I have a gate stopping my cows from getting into mine üòÇ
    Mine is behind my chicken coop and barn omg üòÇ
    Ha I did the same thing. Its a little fenced off area for the pigs and goats
    Mines for the animal too
    haha, I have the same thing going on!
The ghost of my grandpa blackmailed me with haunting my farm forever unless I provide him with diamonds, he never loved me üò≠
    I require context
        Have you played the game to the end before? 

You‚Äôre evaluated at the end (Day 1, Year 3) and if you aren‚Äôt successful, you have to supply the shrine with a diamond to get a redo. Once you‚Äôre successful he leaves for good.
            Yes, I'm currently on the Spring of my third year, I just didn't knew that visit was an actual evaluation from grandpa'
                Yup, it‚Äôs an eval and you can fail it! The number of candles that light up tells you how well you did (along with his dialogue). If all of yours are lit up, you‚Äôre good.
            There‚Äôs an end? I just recently started playing, I better get better at this because my farm sucks. I don‚Äôt even have a kitchen
                Don't worry, you can take as much time as you need or want.

There are people who played the game for hundreds of in-game years.
                    Can you tell me how to build a kitchen? Lol
                        Talk to Robin, the carpenter, she lives north then east of your farm in the large house. You have to talk to her when she's across the counter of the first room you come into when you enter her house (i.e. she's behind the counter and you're not). One option should be to upgrade your house, she'll tell you what you need to bring her. Bring what she asks and she'll come work on your house for a couple days and it'll be bigger and better. You can repeat a couple times for more improvements.
                            Oh thank you, sort of like how I got my coop built. Great
                There's not an end as such, you can take your time learning and getting things done. The evaluation is just a little thing that might give you a goal to aim towards but it doesn't actually end the game, plus it is repeatable if you don't get it all done the first time. You do get a reward for a successful evaluation though!
                I hoesntly wasn't even trying too hard to get all 4 candles lit (aka pass the evaluation) when I first started, but I managed to do it anyway. It's not too difficult. You can look up how to do it, but I think this game is pretty fun if you don't look too deeply into that kind of stuff.
                    I think if you play it as a game it's pretty easy, but a lot of people are very laid back in their play style and treat it more like people play Animal Crossing. You won't get four candles if you spend half your days wandering around just collecting seashells.
                        but it‚Äôs fun to wander around and collect seashells!
                        Haha fair enough! I was always doi g what I could to make the farm better or get further in the mine.
                There‚Äôs an ‚Äúend,‚Äù in a sense that you‚Äôve completed the primary goal the game sets out for you at the beginning, but you can keep playing the same file forever.
                Basically if you work through most or all of the game's mechanics, you'll eventually earn all of the points. Building relationships and getting the community center up are all important toward getting the max score.
            What! I didn‚Äôt know this. What counts as a redo?
                You just get reevaluated. So if you do things to increase your approval (there‚Äôs a hidden point system) with Pops, you can light up all candles and get the best ‚Äúending.‚Äù

Edited because my phone autocorrected point system to support system lol
                    Can you tell me more about this hidden support system?! I didn‚Äôt even know I failed grandpa. I‚Äôm sad, now.
                        Are you sure you did? He would explicitly tell you in his dialogue that you either disappointed him or he knows you could do better. Check to see how many candles lit up after your eval.

Here‚Äôs all the details on the point system if you‚Äôre still curious: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Grandpa#Grandpa.27s_Evaluation
            I've played SD for hundreds and hundreds of hours, but somehow I've never played all the way through the second year into 3 to see grandpa.  Which is fine because he'd be bummed I never marry.
                There are lots of ways to get the required points to make him happy, so it‚Äôs possible to to it without marriage. But you should, of course, be happy to play any way that brings you joy!
        Some done goofed up in their game.
        I don‚Äôt. Every single time I look at this sub, there‚Äôs an inane comment like this, and I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a joke or actual gameplay. And I don‚Äôt want to know either! It‚Äôs hilarious!
When I first played the game I was excited to see what grandpa would say about my farm

When the time came, he was like "I am disappointed in you, you bring shame to the farm" or something like that

It really threw me off...  You know what, fuck you grandpa. I worked really hard on this farm and made it better than that shit show you left behind, I don't need you acknowledgement, I made it better than you could ever do.

And I just built a storage shed in front of his grave and forgot about him xd
    Did you build any relationships with the NPCs? I know that takes into account. I'm just genuinly curious how he could be dissapointed.
        I actually did, in a way a new player would, I talked with most of them daily, gave them gift that they didn't like sometimes, did quest for them, And used the slingshot on the mayor and so on, I didn't really search the internet for anything because I wanted to play without spoiling the fun

Thou I gotta admit I spent most of my time earning sweet sweet money, and exploring the cave
            Wow I'm just really surprised. But also I'm going to have to try the whole slingshot at the mayor thing, thank you for that!
            Did you get married? Have any kids? Take good care of your pet?
                I haven't gotten married or built a relationship to that level, so no kids, and I choose no pets (cat or dog) but I have all 4 candles. Context for anyone who may not want to invest time in those aspects of the game........

Apparently this offends.
                    Okay? Yes, there are many ways to get points but I‚Äôm not trying to spoil the entire point chart for a person who said they are trying to figure things out themselves without spoilers...
                        I was providing context for those like me who may not want those things in their game. Taking care of an in game spouse and children isn't everybody's idea of a good time so I want others to know they do not have to waste time doing those things when they are not necessary.
                            I appreciate it - I've never gotten married in the game but apparently thought it was an essential part of the rating.
                            You don't take care of the children lol.  They're like little pets.
                Marriage wise, I didn't really know how to get married. I know you had to make them like you that's obvious but I didn't know where to go from there, so I had a friend who's really amazing and knows every little thing about the game "vaguely" explain to me what I had to do to get married without spoiling much so that I could connect the dots myself, but I didn't manage to get married before grandpa event.

As for my cat Tuna, it was the only thing that I genuinely loved in the game, and when a pop up massage showed up saying "Tuna loves you" it melted my heart, I didn't know a clumb of pixels could be this cute
                    Well the good thing is that there is no real deadline.  Try maxing things out as much as you can or want to in the game and then get a reevaluation from grandpa.  You can try it as many times as you need to.

This is only if you care about getting that done of course.  It legitimately doesn't matter and you should play the game in whatever way brings you joy!
            Did you complete the community bundles?
    If it helps any, it seems CA realized that bit could seem a little harsh and toned down the language. Instead of "I'm disappointed in you," now it's more of a "Well, as long as you're happy, that's all that matters."
        That's just the old person way of saying I'm disappointed in you. In fact that hurts even more.
This is nice. I am in winter year 3 and I put a bunch of bee hives there and plan to plant a field of flowers. But this is much nicer.
    What makes you want to continue past year 2 end? I always end up restarting.
        Because my farm is not filled to the top with beehives yet.
            I don't think I've ever had more than one. Lol
            Bees?
                Always bees man, bees are great irl, reliable income source that hardly takes any work on the farm in SDV. So yeah, my plan is to build a giant bee sanctuary on my farm, so far I have approx 80 beehives.
        I want to get all the achievements. Cook every recipe once. Ship every item once. Discover every for the museum.  I'm currently trying to get a strong relationship with everyone. I have caught every fish and found every mineral :) but I still have so much more to do.
            I tried that. But artifacts were never being found. And that arcade game.
                Most of the artifacts I've found in the mines and when I dig any spots with worms sticking out and the desert.
        I‚Äôm in year 4 of my first ever run through. I‚Äôm still playing because it‚Äôs relaxing and now that I have millions and millions of dollars, I‚Äôm making my farm pretty, exploring the area for fun, spending time with my wife and kids, etc.
            I always find the goal for me to appease grandpa and see how much I could accomplish in the story time frame.
        I still haven't reached level 100 of scull cave. I still haven't shipped all the items (forgot you can only buy strawberries on the dance festival which I usually skipped to go to the mines). I still have a couple of artefacts to find. I know I am not good enough in arcade to do the Prary King achievement and the junimo cart but for now I want to do everything else.
This is my second run and this time I have so much luck this time. I got the prismatic shard like 3 times so far, and the ancient seed, the dinosaur egg, and a lot of things that I didn't do on the first run. And I didn't even start with the legendary fish. 
Yesterday I stopped on winter 21 year 3. I reorganised my entire farm. Planning to build another coop. I have a fish pond built waiting for spring and a rainy day so I can catch an eel and have eel dishes. I planted a little Grove for my tappers. Still need about 5 more beehives to be happy. 
I still have much to do.
            What do you get for hitting level 100? I usually skip past it with holes.

Glad you still have things to keep going.
        I crushed the secret bundle and bought the house for that white trash lady and now I'm focusing on making things look really pretty
            Secret bundle? White trash lady?
                There is a secret bundle after you complete the community center. Pam is the white trash lady
    I did the same! I have a flower garden, surrounded by fruit trees, with some bee hives.
    Theres a beehive? üò±
I have the river map so my shrine is on a little hill that I can‚Äôt really put anything on...
    Forest map here.. yup, I also don‚Äôt have any room here to get too fancy
        I put my Mayor Lewis statue in with Grandpa's tomb.
            There's a statue of the mayor?
                Do you want a spoiler?
                    No... i will wait patiently. Thanks for asking
                        :) have fun with it!
                            Thanks!
My gramps is hidden behind loads of trees. For like four in game years I had no idea he was back there
    But then when you found it you got the statue, right?
        No... he hates me and only has given me three flames
            :( have you offered a diamond to the tomb to be revaluated?
                Yeah. I just don‚Äôt really interact much with the villagers so I think that‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt have all of the flames. I‚Äôm okay with it though. I still love the game!
                    I love Stardew because you can play it exactly how you want to at your own pace!
Damn we all have the same grandpa, gramps was a playaaaa
    Lmao!
That's lovely!
What is the significance of this in the game? Does it do anything? I am in fall year 2 and not sure if there is a quest or something associated with the shrine ?
    You will find out soon
Now tap the trees
Love this. I do it similarly but I like to use cherry trees, it really brightens it up in the spring! The oak trees look great year round though. Love the paved bits too!
I feel ashamed that I haven‚Äôt thought of honoring  Grandpa like this before. Thank you for the inspiration, I now have to build him a proper shrine now. :D
Damn.. all I did was put the Coops and Barn all around it...
In my current save I just have a bunch of mushroom trees growing in front of the shrine blocking it, idk how grandpa feels about it but I wanted my mushroom taps and that's the place they chose.
    >shroo

Same. I was hoping for a different spot, but oh well.
        I had some very strategic trees planted with high hopes, but totally forgot about the ones hiding behind my silos over there. Oh well, at least they're all contained (I'm on the hill top farm for this save)
            Mine is on the Wilderness Farm. So sometimes I have to defend Grandpa' shrine from purple slimes and other baddies.
Nicely done!  

Also folks, don't forget, you can show your parents / grandparents / loved ones a little love here and now while they're still with us and it will definitely be appreciated.  Take it from me, I'd rather spend five minutes again with my dad than spend a million bucks on a memorial.
Grandpa's shrine is at the back of my tapped tree farm...yours looks much nicer üòÇ
It reminds me of an alter you'd place a Key Item to summon a boss fight haha.
    Definitely a Zelda boss fight vibe going on.
Well this is beautiful, and now I‚Äôm regretting my river layout! Feeling inspired though, thank you!!
I love this! I have a orchard around mine with all the fruit trees
    Me, too. I just love the idea of building a path leading up to the shrine and lining it with trees, and the fruit trees just seemed so much nicer than regular trees.
Now put a couple tappers on these trees and get your resin..
It's what he would've wanted
Maybe a dumb question. But how do you get all the candles to light up? I only got two.
    There's an invisible points system running based on lots of aspects of the game, your farmer skills, your friendships, your money made and more, if you score more than a certain number of points you get all 4 candles lit.
        Oh ok that makes sense. I thought I missed something initially. Thanks!
            Don't worry about only getting two candles. You can always have Grandpa reevaluate your farm, and you can do that as many times as you want (hint: investigate the shrine if you want to get a new evaluation).
Pretty sure my shrine is hidden behind a barn. Literally.
Bruh! Very cool. Any particular reason for Oaks?
me and my friends put a chicken coop in front of it and we all forgot until the end of year 3 and the cuts end showed up and we were like ...oh yeah grandpa...
I love it! Downside of custom farm maps is that so many of them leave almost no room over there.
Today is my actual Grandpa's birthday but he's not with us since 2016 and this made me feel so good
Oohh nice! I have made something similar but yours is much nicer. I need to upgrade ...
So inspiring! Thank you for posting, I'm so happy to have something new to build!
Oooo that‚Äôs smart
I love this
How do you lay paths down on your farm? I seem to only have wood planks and cobblestone paths - I love the look of the brick and stone ones! Is it a mod? I'm playing on Switch, in year 3, and still haven't come across any new paths to design my farm.. :(
    Sorry for the very late answere. It is not a mod. You can buy the schematics from Robin. Possibly this is only later in the game. I'm not sure, I just bought them.
Awesome!
I love this.
Ooo thats so pretty!!
It always feels good to see someone else making a proper Grandpa Shrine.
F
    F
        F me
I really think there should be an ingame letter from grandpa about his expectations of you and your farm. Like without googling it i was clueless on my goals.
Grandpa would like the tree's roots to not be bound up in a sidewalk.
Sheeee is ppapa Illuminati or something lol
It's what gramps would have wanted.
    He always loved those chickens
        ...maybe a little too much.
            That explains the feather growing on my butt once in a while
                And why I can‚Äôt help but slam my face into any seeds I see.
    All gramps wants is you to be happy

I require context
    Have you played the game to the end before? 

You‚Äôre evaluated at the end (Day 1, Year 3) and if you aren‚Äôt successful, you have to supply the shrine with a diamond to get a redo. Once you‚Äôre successful he leaves for good.

What makes you want to continue past year 2 end? I always end up restarting.
    Because my farm is not filled to the top with beehives yet.
        I don't think I've ever had more than one. Lol
        Bees?
            Always bees man, bees are great irl, reliable income source that hardly takes any work on the farm in SDV. So yeah, my plan is to build a giant bee sanctuary on my farm, so far I have approx 80 beehives.
    I want to get all the achievements. Cook every recipe once. Ship every item once. Discover every for the museum.  I'm currently trying to get a strong relationship with everyone. I have caught every fish and found every mineral :) but I still have so much more to do.
        I tried that. But artifacts were never being found. And that arcade game.
            Most of the artifacts I've found in the mines and when I dig any spots with worms sticking out and the desert.
    I‚Äôm in year 4 of my first ever run through. I‚Äôm still playing because it‚Äôs relaxing and now that I have millions and millions of dollars, I‚Äôm making my farm pretty, exploring the area for fun, spending time with my wife and kids, etc.
        I always find the goal for me to appease grandpa and see how much I could accomplish in the story time frame.
    I still haven't reached level 100 of scull cave. I still haven't shipped all the items (forgot you can only buy strawberries on the dance festival which I usually skipped to go to the mines). I still have a couple of artefacts to find. I know I am not good enough in arcade to do the Prary King achievement and the junimo cart but for now I want to do everything else.
This is my second run and this time I have so much luck this time. I got the prismatic shard like 3 times so far, and the ancient seed, the dinosaur egg, and a lot of things that I didn't do on the first run. And I didn't even start with the legendary fish. 
Yesterday I stopped on winter 21 year 3. I reorganised my entire farm. Planning to build another coop. I have a fish pond built waiting for spring and a rainy day so I can catch an eel and have eel dishes. I planted a little Grove for my tappers. Still need about 5 more beehives to be happy. 
I still have much to do.
        What do you get for hitting level 100? I usually skip past it with holes.

Glad you still have things to keep going.
    I crushed the secret bundle and bought the house for that white trash lady and now I'm focusing on making things look really pretty
        Secret bundle? White trash lady?
            There is a secret bundle after you complete the community center. Pam is the white trash lady
I did the same! I have a flower garden, surrounded by fruit trees, with some bee hives.
Theres a beehive? üò±
Forest map here.. yup, I also don‚Äôt have any room here to get too fancy
    I put my Mayor Lewis statue in with Grandpa's tomb.
        There's a statue of the mayor?
            Do you want a spoiler?
                No... i will wait patiently. Thanks for asking
                    :) have fun with it!
                        Thanks!
But then when you found it you got the statue, right?
    No... he hates me and only has given me three flames
        :( have you offered a diamond to the tomb to be revaluated?
            Yeah. I just don‚Äôt really interact much with the villagers so I think that‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt have all of the flames. I‚Äôm okay with it though. I still love the game!
                I love Stardew because you can play it exactly how you want to at your own pace!
Lmao!
You will find out soon
>shroo

Same. I was hoping for a different spot, but oh well.
    I had some very strategic trees planted with high hopes, but totally forgot about the ones hiding behind my silos over there. Oh well, at least they're all contained (I'm on the hill top farm for this save)
        Mine is on the Wilderness Farm. So sometimes I have to defend Grandpa' shrine from purple slimes and other baddies.
Definitely a Zelda boss fight vibe going on.
Me, too. I just love the idea of building a path leading up to the shrine and lining it with trees, and the fruit trees just seemed so much nicer than regular trees.
There's an invisible points system running based on lots of aspects of the game, your farmer skills, your friendships, your money made and more, if you score more than a certain number of points you get all 4 candles lit.
    Oh ok that makes sense. I thought I missed something initially. Thanks!
        Don't worry about only getting two candles. You can always have Grandpa reevaluate your farm, and you can do that as many times as you want (hint: investigate the shrine if you want to get a new evaluation).
Sorry for the very late answere. It is not a mod. You can buy the schematics from Robin. Possibly this is only later in the game. I'm not sure, I just bought them.
F
    F me
He always loved those chickens
    ...maybe a little too much.
        That explains the feather growing on my butt once in a while
            And why I can‚Äôt help but slam my face into any seeds I see.
All gramps wants is you to be happy
    Been very very depressed these few days, and this made me cry.
that's what I think too. I came here to say that about mine- that corner is fenced off for my animals to graze in
Gramps is all ‚ÄúFkn ingrate. I‚Äôm taking my statue of perfection with me.‚Äù
Have you played the game to the end before? 

You‚Äôre evaluated at the end (Day 1, Year 3) and if you aren‚Äôt successful, you have to supply the shrine with a diamond to get a redo. Once you‚Äôre successful he leaves for good.
    Yes, I'm currently on the Spring of my third year, I just didn't knew that visit was an actual evaluation from grandpa'
        Yup, it‚Äôs an eval and you can fail it! The number of candles that light up tells you how well you did (along with his dialogue). If all of yours are lit up, you‚Äôre good.
    There‚Äôs an end? I just recently started playing, I better get better at this because my farm sucks. I don‚Äôt even have a kitchen
        Don't worry, you can take as much time as you need or want.

There are people who played the game for hundreds of in-game years.
            Can you tell me how to build a kitchen? Lol
                Talk to Robin, the carpenter, she lives north then east of your farm in the large house. You have to talk to her when she's across the counter of the first room you come into when you enter her house (i.e. she's behind the counter and you're not). One option should be to upgrade your house, she'll tell you what you need to bring her. Bring what she asks and she'll come work on your house for a couple days and it'll be bigger and better. You can repeat a couple times for more improvements.
                    Oh thank you, sort of like how I got my coop built. Great
        There's not an end as such, you can take your time learning and getting things done. The evaluation is just a little thing that might give you a goal to aim towards but it doesn't actually end the game, plus it is repeatable if you don't get it all done the first time. You do get a reward for a successful evaluation though!
        I hoesntly wasn't even trying too hard to get all 4 candles lit (aka pass the evaluation) when I first started, but I managed to do it anyway. It's not too difficult. You can look up how to do it, but I think this game is pretty fun if you don't look too deeply into that kind of stuff.
            I think if you play it as a game it's pretty easy, but a lot of people are very laid back in their play style and treat it more like people play Animal Crossing. You won't get four candles if you spend half your days wandering around just collecting seashells.
                but it‚Äôs fun to wander around and collect seashells!
                Haha fair enough! I was always doi g what I could to make the farm better or get further in the mine.
        There‚Äôs an ‚Äúend,‚Äù in a sense that you‚Äôve completed the primary goal the game sets out for you at the beginning, but you can keep playing the same file forever.
        Basically if you work through most or all of the game's mechanics, you'll eventually earn all of the points. Building relationships and getting the community center up are all important toward getting the max score.
    What! I didn‚Äôt know this. What counts as a redo?
        You just get reevaluated. So if you do things to increase your approval (there‚Äôs a hidden point system) with Pops, you can light up all candles and get the best ‚Äúending.‚Äù

Edited because my phone autocorrected point system to support system lol
            Can you tell me more about this hidden support system?! I didn‚Äôt even know I failed grandpa. I‚Äôm sad, now.
                Are you sure you did? He would explicitly tell you in his dialogue that you either disappointed him or he knows you could do better. Check to see how many candles lit up after your eval.

Here‚Äôs all the details on the point system if you‚Äôre still curious: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Grandpa#Grandpa.27s_Evaluation
    I've played SD for hundreds and hundreds of hours, but somehow I've never played all the way through the second year into 3 to see grandpa.  Which is fine because he'd be bummed I never marry.
        There are lots of ways to get the required points to make him happy, so it‚Äôs possible to to it without marriage. But you should, of course, be happy to play any way that brings you joy!
Some done goofed up in their game.
I don‚Äôt. Every single time I look at this sub, there‚Äôs an inane comment like this, and I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a joke or actual gameplay. And I don‚Äôt want to know either! It‚Äôs hilarious!
I actually did, in a way a new player would, I talked with most of them daily, gave them gift that they didn't like sometimes, did quest for them, And used the slingshot on the mayor and so on, I didn't really search the internet for anything because I wanted to play without spoiling the fun

Thou I gotta admit I spent most of my time earning sweet sweet money, and exploring the cave
    Wow I'm just really surprised. But also I'm going to have to try the whole slingshot at the mayor thing, thank you for that!
    Did you get married? Have any kids? Take good care of your pet?
        I haven't gotten married or built a relationship to that level, so no kids, and I choose no pets (cat or dog) but I have all 4 candles. Context for anyone who may not want to invest time in those aspects of the game........

Apparently this offends.
            Okay? Yes, there are many ways to get points but I‚Äôm not trying to spoil the entire point chart for a person who said they are trying to figure things out themselves without spoilers...
                I was providing context for those like me who may not want those things in their game. Taking care of an in game spouse and children isn't everybody's idea of a good time so I want others to know they do not have to waste time doing those things when they are not necessary.
                    I appreciate it - I've never gotten married in the game but apparently thought it was an essential part of the rating.
                    You don't take care of the children lol.  They're like little pets.
        Marriage wise, I didn't really know how to get married. I know you had to make them like you that's obvious but I didn't know where to go from there, so I had a friend who's really amazing and knows every little thing about the game "vaguely" explain to me what I had to do to get married without spoiling much so that I could connect the dots myself, but I didn't manage to get married before grandpa event.

As for my cat Tuna, it was the only thing that I genuinely loved in the game, and when a pop up massage showed up saying "Tuna loves you" it melted my heart, I didn't know a clumb of pixels could be this cute
            Well the good thing is that there is no real deadline.  Try maxing things out as much as you can or want to in the game and then get a reevaluation from grandpa.  You can try it as many times as you need to.

This is only if you care about getting that done of course.  It legitimately doesn't matter and you should play the game in whatever way brings you joy!
    Did you complete the community bundles?
That's just the old person way of saying I'm disappointed in you. In fact that hurts even more.
Because my farm is not filled to the top with beehives yet.
    I don't think I've ever had more than one. Lol
    Bees?
        Always bees man, bees are great irl, reliable income source that hardly takes any work on the farm in SDV. So yeah, my plan is to build a giant bee sanctuary on my farm, so far I have approx 80 beehives.

Most of the artifacts I've found in the mines and when I dig any spots with worms sticking out and the desert.
There is a secret bundle after you complete the community center. Pam is the white trash lady
Do you want a spoiler?
    No... i will wait patiently. Thanks for asking
        :) have fun with it!
            Thanks!
Yeah. I just don‚Äôt really interact much with the villagers so I think that‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt have all of the flames. I‚Äôm okay with it though. I still love the game!
    I love Stardew because you can play it exactly how you want to at your own pace!
And why I can‚Äôt help but slam my face into any seeds I see.
Can you tell me how to build a kitchen? Lol
    Talk to Robin, the carpenter, she lives north then east of your farm in the large house. You have to talk to her when she's across the counter of the first room you come into when you enter her house (i.e. she's behind the counter and you're not). One option should be to upgrade your house, she'll tell you what you need to bring her. Bring what she asks and she'll come work on your house for a couple days and it'll be bigger and better. You can repeat a couple times for more improvements.
        Oh thank you, sort of like how I got my coop built. Great
I think if you play it as a game it's pretty easy, but a lot of people are very laid back in their play style and treat it more like people play Animal Crossing. You won't get four candles if you spend half your days wandering around just collecting seashells.
    but it‚Äôs fun to wander around and collect seashells!
    Haha fair enough! I was always doi g what I could to make the farm better or get further in the mine.
Can you tell me more about this hidden support system?! I didn‚Äôt even know I failed grandpa. I‚Äôm sad, now.
    Are you sure you did? He would explicitly tell you in his dialogue that you either disappointed him or he knows you could do better. Check to see how many candles lit up after your eval.

Here‚Äôs all the details on the point system if you‚Äôre still curious: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Grandpa#Grandpa.27s_Evaluation
Okay? Yes, there are many ways to get points but I‚Äôm not trying to spoil the entire point chart for a person who said they are trying to figure things out themselves without spoilers...
    I was providing context for those like me who may not want those things in their game. Taking care of an in game spouse and children isn't everybody's idea of a good time so I want others to know they do not have to waste time doing those things when they are not necessary.
        I appreciate it - I've never gotten married in the game but apparently thought it was an essential part of the rating.
        You don't take care of the children lol.  They're like little pets.
Well the good thing is that there is no real deadline.  Try maxing things out as much as you can or want to in the game and then get a reevaluation from grandpa.  You can try it as many times as you need to.
