[[I've decided to only keep blue & void chicken]]





Screw the chickens.  Ducks and dinosaurs for me!  Though the blue guys are cute.
    I've got rabbits and dinos in another coop (i find dino eggs extremely cute), and the third one is for ducks!
These chickens are definitely white and gold
    OP just needs a second coop with the white and gold chickens
You mustve been beating the chickens they are black and blue haha
    r/angryupvote
Why not get the Golden Chicken as well?
    Still waiting for that update 🤷
        Ahh yea, I see I see- it’s coming!!!
            Supposedly & hopefully 🍀🤞🙏
    Golden chicken are end game. You can’t have them before completing 100% the game so I don’t think you’ll see much people using them tho
        Damnit… now I have to 100% the game. Lol, I didn’t think there was a good reason (other than bragging rights)… but I want a golden chicken!
        Once you know the game you can 100% staring year 3 day 1 of spring so if you play a lot of stardew you can get them starting then
Wait, how do I get a blue chicken?
    Get Shane to 8 hearts and then it’s an option when you buy from marnie
        But you must trigger the cutscene first. Then you go to Marnie, and you refuse to buy any chicken but a blue one (it always says place your white/brown/blue chicken in a coop)
            wait… what? help HAHAHA i’m married to shane and i haven’t figured out a blue chicken option 😩
            Thank you!
        Well heck now I gotta talk to Shane
        Thank you!
        What if we didn’t do the cut scene at 8 hearts, but we still married Shane? I still don’t see the blue chicken at marnie’s
            if you go to marnies while shane is there the cut scene should still trigger iirc
                Ahhh, that didn’t work, after marriage, he only goes to marnies on Mondays for 1 Hr, and marnie isn’t even there.
    RT on this question hahaha
        What's RT?

I swap out for all blue chickens because they’re easier to find in the grass in autumn
    That's true! But the void ones are pretty visible, too
        They are but I don’t find void eggs as useful for recipes. I keep one around for Krobus and that’s about it
            I don't really care about the value, i just like the way the chickens and eggs look, and the mayo, too!
                I don’t care about the value of recipes. I just want their perks. Like coffee making me go fast
                    I love cooking in this game! It's a shame most of the recipes are not profitable. My favourite is spicy eel and miner's treat
                        Love me my pepper poppers.
Me too! I'm only keeping blue and void chickens, one rabbit, dinosaurs (two coops full), and cows, pigs, and one sheep
mayo was always my method of raking in cash, i'm sure you're rolling in it at this point
    Yes, the void mayo and dino mayo are always such a pleasure to produce! And i believe the dino mayo has a purple frame, too!
Wait.. you guys have dinosaurs and blue chickens?
    Put a Dino egg in the incubator and wait until it hatches!
        Where do you get Dino eggs?
            Or fishing chests or a small chance from an artifact spot in the mountains
            skull cavern
                Thank you 😊 I'm fairly new to the game
How do you guys farm enough hay for all of them?
    I don't cut grass in coop / barn areas so they're usually overgrown with grass all season. When you run out during winter, you can buy more hay from Marnie
    I have 4 silos on my first farm, and one on my 2nd (built it before the coop so I could immediately start storing grass as I clear my farm). A lot of my farm is still empty so I let the grass grow there. Whenever I harvest grass, I leave some so it'll keep growing (and replant if needed). Last year I planted a bunch of wheat, too. 

Oh also, I took hay out of my autofeeder and stored it in a chest, so that I could stock up for next year (I harvested more than my silos could hold).
I have a void some pepper Rex’s ducks and chickens all in one coop
This sub is so weird. I love it.
the blue chickens are my favourite!
    Minr, too! They look kinda fluffy
Bloid chickens
    Hahahahah!
Sorry, I've just gotten into the game again. How did you get the blue and black chicken?
    The blue chicken can be bought from Marnie once you have 8 heart relationship with Shane, and you trigger the scene where he tells you about them. The black ones are void chicken and can be hatched from void eggs
        Thank you!!
            No problem!
I married Shane to do this but I haven't gotten any yet and I've sold and raised 3 chickens so far. What is the secret, oh wise one?
    Just buy them from Marnie! When you buy chicken from her, she always tells you the colour of the chicken before you place them in a coop. I just close the convo if the chicken isn't blue and try again
        I didn't know that, thank you!
            I'm happy to help! I'm usually on the 'Whaaat!?' side of this sub haha!
I dont remember void mayo, but iirc void eggs sell for less than regular ones. Unless it's changed since i checked....
I only keep 1 void chicken, their eggs and mayo are cheap, 1 Dino, 2 rabbits, and a couple of blues for looks. I also get 4 ducks and 2 mayo makers - because a duck lays an egg every second day or so. Duck mayo is more profitable.
    I keep three coops: one for ducks, one for chicken, and one for rabbits and dinos. I like to have lots of animals
Me too! We can be chicken buddies!

The brown ones are too hard to see in the grass, especially in the fall. I usually only keep them around long enough to get brown-egg achievements, then switch to all white until I ❤️ Shane enough to swap them all out.

I know gold chickens are a thing in 1.5 but I'm almost exclusively a mobile player.
    I only play on mobile, too! I can't wait for the update to be released!
Racist
    Hahaha, nooo!
Your chickens joined the Dimir guild
    I guess there's something they're not telling me...
