[[Grandfather himself complained about his bed]]





Grampa really does not like sleeping on a ping pong table
    grandpa is ping pong table
This dialogue never made sense to me.

How does one go from the subject of a bed to a house as if they're one in the same?

Grandpa could have hated the bed but still loved the house.
    grandpa probably lived in the bed or under the bed
        Makes sense, he looks like he’s been welded to it lmao

            "Your grandpa sure did love that ol' ping-pong table."

                    I’m mad as hell that awards are no longer a thing, as you deserve one.  🏆
    Maybe it's all he talked about. Like, "Hey Lewis, I see you've made a gold statue of yourself, and I think that's fantastic. Anyway, I could really use some hired help on my farm. Maybe then I won't have to sleep in a bed made of Lincoln logs."
        It’s made of [INNER-CITY REC-ROOM PING-PONG TABLE]. Get it right.
Did he not think to commission Robin for a new one or something? It’s not like he HAD to sleep on the ping pong table
    Maybe grandpa just didn’t have the money. It seems like a while between when grandpa died and when you actually open his letter working at Joja, but the complete and utter disarray of the farm (like the greenhouse) could mean he didn’t have any income.
        That could be why so many townspeople are hesitant to meet you, too. “Oh, that wacky old farmer whose crops were always bitter and gross has a granddaughter? And she’s going to be the new farmer? Fantastic.”
        I'm torn. On the one hand, the only way to be a successful farmer in this community is to hunt monsters, rely on an unexplainable magic, and work tirelessly from the moment you wake up to when you pass out. Oh any sometimes you'll spend days just chopping trees and rocks and such just to make room to farm but your tools aren't even good enough to fully do that. That's a hard, hard life for an old man.

But on the other hand, he owns a literal iridium printer. So he probably could have figured out how to use that to improve his situation.
Well that’s no surprise. Why didn’t anyone bring him a new one?
