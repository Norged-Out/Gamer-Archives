[[Everything you need to knowdo for the skull caverns]]


Edit: thank you to those who put extra tips in the replies! I added them in italics

I spent over an hour writing this as a reply, and nobody saw it, so I'm posting it here (yes I'm aware there's a lot of guides out there but who knows maybe mine is helpful to someone)

**WHAT TO BRING/DO:**

* **lots of cows for cheese** (don't get goats. goat cheese and regular cheese have the same health & energy. goats can only be milked every other day. large milk will give you gold quality cheese, which is the best, but regular quality cheese is good too) *(trade emeralds on Thursdays for cheese at the desert trader. Imo this is too expensive considering cheese is really easy to get)*
* **collect rubies (and/or eel's and hot peppers)** (trade rubies any day at the desert trader for spicy eel. if you want to craft it, you need 8 hearts with george for the recipe and an upgraded house/cookout kit to craft it)
   * use a crystalarium to replicate rubies (completing the 25k vault bundle will give you a crystalarium)
* **collect jades (or lots and lots of stone)** (trade jades on sunday's at the desert trader for staircases. 100 stone can craft 1 staircase but this is a lot harder than just collecting jades)
   * use a 2nd crystalarium to replicate jades (after donating 50 minerals to the museum you will get a crystalarium. you can also craft one but that's hard imo.) (ps i replicate rubies first but you can do jades instead. or you can alternate them)
* **lots and lots of bombs**
   * regular bombs take 4 iron ore, 1 coal (can trade 5 quartz any day at the desert trader). mega bombs take 4 gold ore, 1 solar essence, 1 void essence (can trade 5 iridium ore any day at the desert trader).
* **plenty of coffee and/or a few triple shot espresso's (15 coffee or 3 triple shot espresso's will last you until 2am if you leave asap)** (fulfilling evelyn's "gifts for george" special order request will give you a coffee maker that gives you 1 coffee every morning. 5 coffee beans in a keg makes coffee. you can also buy coffee but i dont recommend it) (trade a diamond any day at the desert trader for triple shot espresso's. can turn 3 coffee's into 1 triple shot espresso if you have an upgraded house/cookout kit)
* **have a desert warp totem** (can trade 3 omni geodes any day at the desert trader to get one)
* **get a prismatic shard for the special sword** (this can be pretty hard to get without actually going into the skull caverns but your best chance is a mystic stone in the quarry \[purplish stone with blue swirls\]. they're rare but if you do get one to spawn, sleep a day, then break the stone. if you don't get a prismatic shard, reset the day and try again. it is also possible to get one from the regular mines but you'd have to kill, on average, almost 10k monsters AFTER reaching the bottom of the mines to get one)
   * **if you don't want to wait forever to get one, you can bring your best weapon** (personally i would bring the bone sword or steel falchion if you have one, but its still not the best) *(a lava katana seems to be a better option. Buy it from Marlon for $25k)* **and attempt to find a prismatic shard in the skull caverns itself**
      * you can staircase to at least level 100 and attempt to find a mystic stone or
      * staircase to at least level 25 and focus on only breaking iridium nodes (they have a 4% chance of dropping a prismatic shard)
* **clean inventory** (only tools you need is your weapon and a pickaxe, which is optional if you have enough bombs \[you will need a lot\]. have your food and supplies too) (i also highly recommend only going once you have all 3 inventory rows open, *but you can go with just 2 rows*)

**STRATEGY:**

* **only go on "the spirits are very happy" days**
* **have a chest next to your bed/tv with all the necessary supplies so you can warp to the desert immediately at 6am** 
* **warp to the desert, eat a spicy eel, drink a coffee and go**
* **only eat cheese to regain health and energy** (a spicy eel is used for +1 speed, and +1 luck. a coffee gives +1 speed and stacks with the spicy eel. if you eat a different food or drink with a buff, it will automatically replace the previous buff from the food/drink. this means you can eat 1 dish with a buff and 1 drink with a buff at the same time.)
* **do not eat another spicy eel until the  +1 speed or +1 luck it gives you runs out**
* **only focus on getting iridium and finding a ladder/shaft, do not waste your time killing every single enemy. only kill those that are actually attacking you**
* **don't worry about making it home to sleep, the 1k gold and energy you lose is worth the extra time *(you WILL NOT lose items if you pass out, only if you die)***
* **staircase through any floors that give you trouble**
* ***Bring an emergency farm warp totem to get you out in a pinch***
* ***Do not take all of your cheese, spicy eel, coffee etc. only take about half and maybe 75% of your bombs in case you die***


I know you say the pickaxe is optional, but you should bring a pickaxe just in case you spawn on a floor surrounded by rocks on all sides and don’t have any space to drop a bomb
it's a no from me right away, within the first few lines you are telling me to bring lots of cows? bro I am trying to move as fast as possible through the skull caverns, in no world do I have time to be herding cattle
    Lmao that would be funny if we could bring cows with us.

Imagine you're 50 floors deep and you stop to yank on a cow then vigorously churn the milk until you get cheese
        Hey it would free up some inventory space at least!
    But I mean they may be helpful as a method to continuously trample down mummies...or give as a sacrifice to the iridium bats
Side tip about bombs: crafting them takes hella resources (especially coal.. precious coal). If you’re at a point in the game where money isn’t an issue, just >!purchase them from the dwarf in the room to the right in the mines entrance!<

Or, if you’ve picked up the master slingshot, the adventurers guild seal explosive ammo. I’ll usually bring lots of bombs and ammo for pesky rooms or hitting groups of stones without needing to run up to them, drop a bomb, run away.
    how do you befriend that dwarf??
        You need the four dwarf scrolls
        He loves gemstones. I’ve been giving him 2 rubies every week, and he’s my BFF now. (But he’ll sell you bombs regardless of friendship level.)
        You need to have donated the 4 Dwarf Scrolls to the museum.
    Funny that mega bombs ended up the economic option for me. So many useless gold and essences lying around in my chests after some runs.
Very clean, and well said friend. 12/10.

BUTTT you forgot the best advice, just reset the day if you don't get the results you're looking for. Don't allow it to save, just RESET. It'll save you a bunch of resources, and headaches when you're looking for specific items >!(I.E. AUTO PETTER)!<
    True true. I actually haven't gotten late game enough to go to the skull caverns for specific items like that yet. However I am doing this for crystal shoes lol
    i didn't know resetting the day changed the results of chest, i thought it was predefined, thanks!
    May I ask if the floors for treasure rooms (besides floor 100 after beating qi's challenge) stay the same each reset, or are they randomized each time?
        Randomized each time
            Damn thanks, I've been playing Stardew for a good chunk of time, even got to >!True Perfection!< and there are still plenty of things I have to know!
Just a tip from my stupid brain regarding staircases... 

When I first started out, and eventually made it to floor 100, Mr Qi, the judgemental arse that he is, told me off for using more than X (ten maybe?) staircases. I was convinced it caused something to happen, but I wasn't sure what. 

After that, in different playthroughs, I made sure to use less staircases because I didn't want to cause whatever happened before... It made getting to floor 100 even harder, and after making it, the Judgey asshat was like "Yeah, that's the way to do it!" and I was waiting for the reward or something, but nothing happened...

It was at this point I turned to the ol' Google, and looked up the differences between few or loads of staircases.

Aside from the two different things he says to you, it changes nothing. He's either pleased or he's not! This weird dude that has a casino, an island retreat, openly admits to being a spying weirdo, with nothing better to do that set stupid tasks for you, HE judges YOU?

Pfft what a dick!

So, unless you want this anonymous moron to be pleased with you, use as many staircases to get to Floor 100 as you like! Ignore his words!

His fashion sense sucks as well.
    He really is a freaking weirdo. Don't let him judge you! This made me laugh
        What a weirdo.  Anyway lemme slurp down thus mysterious snake milk from the nice man in the sunglasses in a cave.
This is awesome, thanks!! A lot of stuff I 'knew' but it helps seeing it laid out plainly. I forget about all the stuff I can trade at the desert trader - I'd only been using them for staircases.
    Apparently you can trade emeralds for cheese on Thursday! But I find it youy start early you should have a lot of cheese quickly
        Oh I have CHEESE for days
Don't forget about a warp totem home in case you need to bounce immediately. Like it's 1:55 am and you don't wanna die in the caverns, or you are out of food in the middle of attack in an area you can't use staircases.
    Hi. Passing out at 2 am in the skull cavern makes you just wake up in your bed with 1 k lost, but no objects lost.
        I’ve honestly just been letting myself pass out lately. What’s $28k a season to an ancient fruit wine mogul like myself?
    I'd rather stay rich lol. Warp totems are easy to make. 
Thank you very much for this. I'm working on getting the slime charmer ring as I'm terrified of going into skull cavern, but this helps a lot!! I've only got 200 slopes to go, but I might try these tuos and go earlier.

Also, on an unrelated note, my trash bear just asked for a spicy eel, so thanks for the reminder about where I can get it. I thought I was going to have to spam George with leeks.  Lol
    Yup slime charmer ring was the game changer for me!!
    Slime charmer ring isn’t super helpful in skull caverns. There aren’t very many slimes down there.
        I disagree. Slime charmer ring with burglar ring is amazing
            Agreed! Slime charmer + burglar and then iridium band+ explosive ring is a hill I’ll die on!
                The slimes also drop iridium occasionally!
        Yep, it's the Serpent that gets you. There are defensive ring combinations if one is afraid of combat.
Thank you for this!! I haven’t opened the game in a few days because I need to dive into Skull Cavern and I’ve been meaning to poke around the subreddit to cobble together a strategy. This is freaking awesome.
    Whats worked for Me is slime charmer ring. Lots of staircases, I had like 5 crystalarium making jade now I have like 30.  Coffee is a must triple Shot espressos.  I also do spicy eel and cheeses.  

I have had some of my best runs on neutral days.  U don't even start getting iridium rocks until level 18 but u get a goal for hitting level 25. 

Oh DO NOT EAT BY THE LADDER .. more than a few times I ate something to close and it made me leave the Mine.
        Yes ditto to the slime charmer ring. I always combine it and a burglar ring together, then when I get a napalm ring I combine it with an iridium band
            Ahhh you already said it! I just don’t like calling the explosive ring that because… ummm… war crimes and whyyyyy did CA have to name it that but yessssss best combo
                Honestly not really sure 😭 bomb ring or explosive ring definitely would've been a better fit
This is all excellent advice. 


I have has better drops and made it through more levels with the combo of two luck rings (one with crab shell, one slime charmer) and magic rock candy and Qi spiced ginger ale. I get treasure floors far more often and more mine shafts to jump in. 

For me Luck > Speed

Get the galaxy souls on your weapon when you can. And the cinder boots from the dwarf in the volcano mines.
Hi, I am on Year 2 and looking to try the Skull Cavern. What’s the best weapon to bring for beginners?
    If you have the gold and no prismatic shard yet, the best is to buy the lava katana. Otherwise the galaxy sword is best !
        Thanks a lot! Just bought it :)
You can also use the exploding ring (Napalm ring) to save on bombs
    This is the way.
Reading this makes me feel a little weird for having 36 crystalariums copying jade all the time…
    I've got 5 and a like 10 for diamonds lol. I've also never really cared for the spicy eel. I like pumpkin soup and have a huge stack of salmon berries. I just found out magma caps have a super high healing rate so I've been collecting those for my cavern runs. That jade is a lifesaver. If I remember I try to go every other Sunday to trade it in and if you befriend the wizard he sends it to you in the mail sometimes.
        Magma caps with the foraging profession making everything purple on pickup is wonderful.
            Yes lol I have so many purple foraged items for mining snacks.
            I always pick that just to save in inventory space 😆
I gotta add that the best weapon for the skull cavern till u find the prismatic shard and get the Galaxy sword is the Lava Katana. (This is if u haven't unlocked Ginger Island yet). You buy it from the Adventurers Guild for 25,000 after you've reached the bottom of the mines (pretty expensive yes, but it saved me a couple of times)
    I personally haven't bought weapons outside the hammer so thanks! I always was put off by it bc it doesn't have speed on it. I'm a +4 speed weapon girly
Instructions unclear: me and my herd are now all stuck in the cavern. Mooooooo.

    I fixed it lol. Brain fog moment
        Hahaha it made me giggle to think of attempting an iridium ore mining run but having to bring like 4 cows along too and attempt to milk them on the run while juggling a cheese press too 😂 Super-advanced hard mode!
that's lotta work when you could just get 100 salads and bombs and then wreak havoc on a lucky day
    Imo it's actually not a lot of work. Mostly passive work (prismatic shard aside)
This list is good.

I would make one change to use crab cakes instead because it will stack with espresso and make us very fast.

People will eat spicy eel for a chance of a treasure, but to me, this is not the best use because the treasures are not really worth going after. What am I going to do with 10 beers? Such a waste.

With the extra speed, I can got further and faster, and I can find more stuff to sell. Then buy my own beer. lol
THANK YOU !!! i'm a baby player and cannot get past the first 1 second
If you have ginger island unlocked, make it to level 5 in the volcano and you can buy as many cherry bombs, bombs, and mega bombs as you like. No more precious resources (coal) wasted! Usually has a meal to buy too like roots platter or super meal
Is the “only on lucky days” part overstated? I was under the impression that the in-game +\- luck is a pretty small range of values. Even a +1 luck from spicy eel offsets a negative day so much that it doesn’t really matter. 

IMO it isn’t worth basing a run on the mines off of the day’s luck. Especially when you can stack lucky lunch (+3 luck I believe?) and coffee.
    It takes me some time to rebuild my bomb and sometimes stair supply after a run, so it makes sense to pick the highest luck day.
    To each their own but the spawn rates for ladders and shafts are a lot greater on high luck days. On low luck or even neutral there might be ONE or possibly two ladders on the whole floor. Luck of food you eat does not affect ladders or chances of not getting infested or prehistoric floors or a spawn of serpents.

You can test for yourself how far you get on a good luck day vs bad. Personally I get significantly farther on a high luck day.
Any tips on which rings to use?
I usually use the invincibility ring (Yoba blessing), but the chance is so low I'm thinking there might be a better choice
    Burglar ring/slime charmer ring
Iridium band and napalm ring.

If you can't forge rings yet do iridium band and slime charmer (or burglar ring)
        I can only craft the iridium band for now. I'll keep an eye for the others when I can forge them
I would add a recommendation to NOT bring your full supply of cheese, coffee, bombs etc... on the off chance you do die, you don't want to have to choose between which of these to loose. Leave at least some at home so you aren't completely without said supply while you build it back up.
"What to bring... lots of cows"

Instructions unclear, the skull caverns are now a multi-level dairy farm.
    Brain fog was a little intense last night LMAO. Fixed it to "bring/do"
Will i not lose things if i pass out on the skull cavern? The farthest ive gotten is to the 25th and thats mostly thanks to my staircases crafted from 99 stones 😭. I think my biggest problem is that i die too easily, most often bcos of those green ghost snakes. Is the lava katana enough of a weapon? Its the best one ive got, i think, tho i also have the hammer and some bone swords.
    No, you only lose items when you die. You will lose $1K if you pass out but you don't lose any items.
1st and 2nd crystalarium for diamond imo, trade diamond for triple shot. The rest crystalarium is for jade. Copying ruby is not worth it since serpent sometimes drop spicy eel.

Try to get burglar ring, increase chance for drops like rabbit foot, red cabbage seed, solar essence for mega bombs, spicy eel, iridium bat drop like tonic, elixir, battery pack. Use bad luck day to farm dust sprite.

You can get cheese at desert trader for emerald on Friday.

Just go skull cavern even you don't have max inventory. You can buy backpack usually after complete 2nd skull cavern run. 

Spirits not very happy? Use magic rock candy. This is possible after several cavern runs, got several prismatic shards. You probably can get back 3 prismatic shards during this buffed run.

Worry about 1k gold loss? Don't have any money with you then. Harvey, marlon, linus, joja team will send you home for free.

True true. I actually haven't gotten late game enough to go to the skull caverns for specific items like that yet. However I am doing this for crystal shoes lol
i didn't know resetting the day changed the results of chest, i thought it was predefined, thanks!
May I ask if the floors for treasure rooms (besides floor 100 after beating qi's challenge) stay the same each reset, or are they randomized each time?
    Randomized each time
