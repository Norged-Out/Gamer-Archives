[[Finally Made it to the Core]]





Heh. Welcome to the club.

Bee tee dubs, super efficient way to get to the core of any planet is a tractor, a trailer, a t3 drill, two QT-RTGs for power, two of whatever resource the planet needs to activate the core, and three packagers. When you get to the core, package the drill and the tractor and the trailer and put everything in your backpack and teleport back to the surface!
Had this exact same thing happen to me, getting stuck in there I mean. Rite of passage
I have to close my eyes when I get there until it calms down because it sometimes makes me motion sick
I have everything unlocked and I only have ONE surface Pylon active. ONE!
Average core experience
