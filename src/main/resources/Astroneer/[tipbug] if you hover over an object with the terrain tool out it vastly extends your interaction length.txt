Shhhh! They'll patch it!
    This is intended not a bug
        Really?
        what makes you say that
            it's been known since I think the very first early access alpha release

it's a really nice QoL feature
    It's been in the game literally as long as I can remember (I've played since the late 2016 build) and I'm pretty sure if they wanted to it would be packed out
This video for some reason made me think that I was planets had more variation other than being "Ice planet. Grass planet. Desert planet." No planet has bodies of water and none of them have variation within themselves.
Nooo i wanted to post that lol
Everyone already knows this.
