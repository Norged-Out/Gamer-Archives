[[Simple Resources Tree (made for myself, but some people might find this useful)]]





Good work. 

There is a similar one on the wiki that has a legend indicating which planet each resource is found on.
    What is the wiki and how do I get to it?
        Oh my gosh you've been playing without the wiki?! It's open on my second monitor without fail when I'm playing. Stop much useful info there
            I'm not entirely sure I could play without it.

                    It‚Äôs not like I sat at the loading screen not knowing what to do. 

But I was constantly referring to it. Every time I played I had to remind myself of symbols or what was on each planet or what elements were needed to make compounds.
                        Absolutely. I can obviously play without it, but I'd be going to wrong planets way too often
                    The wiki is a bit more conveniently formatted than the in-game astropedia.
                    What if he does?

                    Well yeah. Hes joking.
            Pretty much I went into this game blind, I just learned that you can use the the terrain tool to flatten and build ramps. I‚Äôve been trapped underground for hours and hours
        here you are https://astroneer.fandom.com/wiki/Resources

What software did you use to do this tree?
            pretty much adobe photoshop
                okay, thanks :)

    oh my god, should have made some research before i did it, there are tons of nice tables, i have been working on this one for like 4 days (planning, getting each pictures, finalizing etc) now i feel like i wasted my time and effort :P
        Hey, it‚Äôs not wasted at all. You have a hobby and you turned your time into making something you wanted to. It now opened a discussion and is helping you even further on your path.

That doesn‚Äôt just apply to Astroneer. There‚Äôs lessons to be learned here for other aspects of your life as well and that is invaluable.

You did an amazing thing! Keep it up
        What you created is great and we appreciate your efforts.  You probably know the resource requirements better than most now.  Sometime, years from now, you'll be playing a trivia game and "which of the following resources are required to make Graphene in Astroneer" will come up and it'll all feel worth it.  

Seriously, though ... thanks for putting the time in to create this and make the community stronger.  üôè
            aww that's so sweet of you, maybe i will be in who wants to be a millionaire and then astroneer resources question pops up and bam! XD
        Not at all man, creating this table allowed you to get real intimate with the intricacies of crafting and material production. You probably have a much more full understanding of it all. A lot of times, projects like creating this table end up being the very reason you no longer need the table.
        Wasted? Dude this looks so much fun to do. Almost as much as playing the game. Keep thinking on what you can do next, we'll appreciate it and you get a lot more from the game than most people do
2 things that I would personally change. Graphite and nano carbon alloy aren't between the lines and colors for what planets you can find them on
    noted, the planetary colorization idea is superb
        also because it seems to flow from left to right i got co fused by the gases at first. so maybe different colour? but thats less criticism and more idiot proofing for no reason.
overall very nice
They should add this to the game
This is nice. Clean layout. Well done.

I'm just over here with a whole set of all the resources needed for Nanocarbon on an Active Storage near my production area so I can just look and get copies of what I need. Not resource efficient, but I don't have to open my menus 100 times anymore.
Spot On!

I was about to do the same so thank you for sharing this!!!
Another reminder of how useless the gasses are in this game.
    Good luck doing anything late game without them though
        You definitely need a stock of all of them in late game. But, like 1-2 medium cans would last you a lifetime, except maybe hydrogen if you have a hydrazine addiction like me.
It's very pretty, you've done good work!
I just memorized em lol
Amazing graph
why can't astroneer have this simple resource tree?
nice work, would you be able to add in the planet icons like the image use in the fandom wiki?  I feel the chem lab makes more sense in this layout than the one they're using.
