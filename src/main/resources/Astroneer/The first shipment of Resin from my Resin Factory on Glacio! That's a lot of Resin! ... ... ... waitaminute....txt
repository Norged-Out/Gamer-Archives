[[The first shipment of Resin from my Resin Factory on Glacio! That's a lot of Resin! ... ... ... waitaminute...]]





Some no good hombre must have swapped out my precious Resin with some useless radioactive materials! Darn that hombre!!!
Thats a lot of nanocarbon alloy
What are your supply lines like?

For me the biggest problems have been with finding ammonium and graphite for large scale nanocarbon production.
    Had the same problem, very simply fixed with a thumper on graphite over on glacio, followed by a thumper on some Ammonium on calador.

My calador thumper just feeds a chem station with a gas condenser grabing that juicy Hydrogen. Easy hydrazine all day long.

I looked around in creative mode until I found some ammonium, graphite, hematite and titanite deposits, all relatively close to each other, and they're all nearly full green bars on the auto extractors!

Glacio is missing helium, hydrogen and nitrogen gasses. Fortunatly, that's not too hard to solve by transporting over the gasses via shuttle.

I'm currently almost out of soil for my centrifuge to turn into organic to carbon, but I'm going to switch the system over to using a large container of tungsten, turning it into worklights -> scrap -> organic via trade platform, and then smelt into carbon. ... on the basis that farming up a large silo of soil is more effort than collecting a full container of tungsten.
            Sounds like a spild plan. Once you have soil to scrape automated it's super easy to get anything you could ever need.
First you get the resin, then you get the power, then you get the women...
    I didn't see that patch. I'm going to assume it's a PC only feature.
Holy Guacamole!
What are you planning to do with all of those?
    Im wondering that too. All you can make with them is like the portable oxygenator and rtg.
        Obviously they're gonna make 800 RTGs and make a house out of them
If you put your nanocarbon factory on Vesania you can automate 3 of the 4 gasses
    Mr efficiency here knows how us lazy people automate, one gas input down from four just yes please
        My only inputs are soil, helium and a 1 time investment of 8 scrap in my vesania factory.
            I like the sound of that, do you know your soil to nanocarbon rate by any chance?
                I dont. I did a video on my machine. Its fully automated, even the trade platforms.  

This was before the soil canisters could be automated on small printers so I am sure it could be more efficient now.

                    Now that was a very Intresting watch thanks for linking it. Its definitely given me a few little things to try building my own system.

The combining of the buffer platform for scrape is genius! Ive always hated trying for a 6 slot and having to use a clock. But just making a 14 makes perfect sense and cuts down on the sensors.
                        Yeah, that was the longest amount of time I spent troubleshooting. Im incorporating the same buffer tech into a machine that divides my scrap into trade platforms and sends off for the unique resources now and it is working well for that too.
                            Plans never just go perfect, but the results are always worth it. That sounds like a useful machine to have around. I've always loved how figureing out these basics mechanisms just opens more and more ideas, a simple game doing automation right.
                                If you are using soil, you would have to use A LOT of soil! ... trading for organic and hematite huh. Ouch.
                                    You dont trade for organic, you use the soil centrifuge. You trade for Titanite and Hematite.
I wish I was you ): the only nanocatbon alloy I’ve ever gotten in my game was from completing an special request mission lol
huh.... thats a bummer. that could have been alot of resin, and now its some useless material that will never get used! ever!
    The ironic thing is, this pretty much came true today. Was doing some major base expansion, and I needed hundreds of resin, and had to go scavenge it, farm it, etc etc etc. ... used some nanocarbon alloys, yeah, but only a couple of dozen.
Well i can't say you'll be out of power soon
    Resin for power? Is this just referring to RTGs you can make?
        Yeah i'm just referring to RTGs. Are they not crafted with nanocarbon alloy anymore?
            Yes, that’s all I know about too, just making sure I didn’t miss something obvious.
                Oh no i didn't try making any hidden jokes
                    I got nearly 10k u/s  from my solar farm on Calidor lol...
Ive done this too, i understand your pain
Would you lend me some of your... resin please?
HOLY CRAP
