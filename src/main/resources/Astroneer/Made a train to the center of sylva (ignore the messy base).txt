[[Made a train to the center of sylva (ignore the messy base)]]





There‚Äôs trains now??? Sick üòÅ
    It's a totally different game in many respects. Now I have to start another game. Maybe work up to an Atrox base.
        Look at Astroneer from 2017 - you wouldn't convince me it's the same game had I not played it back then and kept following it ever since.
            I used to play it before it had any kind of story, before planets had names and when the core of planets was just a solid rock.

I then stopped playing for ages and i picked it up again in (i think) 2019, all of a sudden there's big purple things??? Rockets look completely different??? Base building is completely different???
        What game is this?
        Absolutely love this game I‚Äôll have to give it yet a other playthrough ^^ too bad my friends aren‚Äôt as impressed by it‚Ä¶.
I made a slip n slide version that may or may not be lethal
I shall not ignore the messy base and the windy as heck train track. Use a large rover for a smooth ride.
    I'll do that when I get a drill thing for it

        The trade platform needs tungsten and iron (and an EXO chip). This means you need to visit at least two planets. If you plan the sequence in which you retrieve resources, you can have the large rover by the time you have the trade platform incl. RTG, drill 3, paver, and medium solid & fluid canister. The extra time is maybe 1-2 hours but you have way more options from that point moving forward. You can see what I do when I start a new game, link in my profile. After I get the small shuttle, I use a medium storage to get resources to build a large shuttle and two atmospheric condensers. The I get argon, helium, and methane. If I am lucky I find a diamond or two on Atrox. If not I make it with the chemistry lab. The beginning of a save is always the same sequence.
        Mine is even worse, I had everything I would have needed to make a nice track to the core, but I wanted to do it the most efficient way possible, so I took my dig tool and just made a tunnel straight down to the core. When you ride the train down, you can‚Äôt see a thing, only when you pass a cave layer, you can get a brief glimpse of where you are at.

It‚Äôs just for getting Astronium to my base, so I didn‚Äôt worry too much about the look.
You made a ~~train~~ ROLLERCOASTER to the center of Sylva!
Man, that brings back memories of the first time I reached the planet core.
Same, I added stations at each end, stations on the way and two lanes for two consecutive 6 long trains to ride on took 2 days
Hey, if I ignored messy bases I wouldn't have a base.
    Yea but I'm too lazy to sort my base out. Last time I did my friend just messed it up within hours
        Yeah, my bases usually start as circles, then go off the rails when I start adding extra storage or power on the outside. I try to trim the fat, but just end up with extra things in storage that I will never use.
pathetic.  
make a train go from core to space and then a train in the sky going all around the planet.

yes i did that

and there's proof of it existing
    I want to see this proof
        [https://youtu.be/D76cLGicaUk](https://youtu.be/D76cLGicaUk)Also I still have the raw footage and can rerecord it to have the full ride

edit: and yes this is in survival however I think I didn't show it in the video
Why? Make it to astronium. The gateways will take you to the core.
    It's splits off at a certain point. It goes to the core and astronium
        Gotcha. I haven‚Äôt experimented with junctions yet.
nice, what are u using it for?
Nice. Me too. Then I did another in Atrox straight down. Bit of a pain but it was worth it.
How else to get astronium?
Your base is so messy the video won't even play.
    DAMNüíÄ
Haha, you think that‚Äôs messy? You ain‚Äôt seen nothing‚Ä¶
    Oh god
        Yeah‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs bad‚Ä¶
Less concerned about the messy base we don't even see and more concerned about you using random bits of terrain instead of the spires themselves to mount your train to.  


Or did they change something since the trains came out?
Deep rock has better roller coasters
I did the same but to get a lot of astronium, then trade it for solid fuel rockets, crush them and now I have infinite resources. Its op af.
