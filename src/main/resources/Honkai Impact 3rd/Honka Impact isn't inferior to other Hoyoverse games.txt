[[Honka Impact isn't inferior to other Hoyoverse games]]


I just started out and reached lvl 50, but what I've seen so far is really impressive.  


I think Honkai Impact isn't inferior to Genshin or Star Rail. It just has an outdated presentation and UI.   


But the amount of content is great.  


If Hoyoverse would use the UI of their newer titles, get the models & graphics up to par and introduce the manga chapters ingame how [https://hoyostans.be/explore/honkai-impact-3rd/consumers-guide-hi3/hi3-phase-1/](https://hoyostans.be/explore/honkai-impact-3rd/consumers-guide-hi3/hi3-phase-1/) does it, the game would blow up.  


I know they work on Zenless Zone 0, but I feel like the could tidy up HI3 and it could become even more of a money printer.  


But maybe making a new game is less effort.  


What do you think?


It's hard for honkai impact 3 to grow big for several reasons

-its pretty old so people won't get into it easily since there's fomo of missed events and characters not much issue in hsr and genshin since there's no PvP

-Not casual friendly like the other 2

-No male characters ( hsr and genshin prove that they do infact bring in money and greater audience to the game even pgr and aether gazer realised this )

-powercreep every patch and this fact is well known across all three communities giving it a difficult rep from start

-visual novel style story without dub would be considered downgrade for genshin or hsr players.

Hoyo knows this so they do their best to keep their current playerbase and vets happy in hi3 while genshin only care about bringing new players and ignoring veterans.Hsr is a good middle ground.
    Thanks for taking your time to write this.  


Very good points.   


I see... The issues are quite challenging.  


There is another one that just came to mind.  


Competition is getting fiercer every year.  


People would rather try new games than old ones.   


I recently saw a video with upcoming gachas, and the market seems really competitive.
    It's also not dubbed nor subbed in any other languages, it's so weird the game it's only japanese and Chinese voices and English, Chinese, Japanese, Corean and I think French but not Spanish (for example) the 4th most spoken language in the world
    The powercreep every parch thing is misinformation because we have valks who are or have been meta for over 2.5 years lol
        still, nothing is better as phy dmg as new seele... power creep is real, we just have other options
    I never realized that it wasn't voiced since I always play in CN dub. Surprised hoyo didn't dub it as well in JP
        Main story are dubbed in both CN and JP, except for some few exceptions which happens more because of logistics and contract reasons than no plan to dub it.

Events on the other hand though, are only dubbed in CN with JP dub CG (don't ask why). Some events, rare as they are, are dubbed in JP. So honestly JP dub are like a wierd thing in events.
    I think one of the biggest issues is the lack of an English dub. Dubs go so far to make things more accessible to English-only speakers, in my case I have pretty severe ADHD and as a result sitting down to play honkai and read the story is more of an undertaking than it is in genshin. I still power through because at first I was very driven by my love of genshin and since then I’ve fallen in love with the story in its own right, but I fall behind a lot since I can’t easily put the cutscenes on auto and do something with my hands to help me pay better attention
    Only one that can go against this is nikke …but nikke brings in the lewd ahha
It’s what you said+powercreep

Unfortunately unless they minimize powercreep with how they do in Genshin/Star Rail then Honkai won’t ever blow up to their level(even then it’s a small chance)

Part 2 with the updated graphics might do something but don’t keep your hopes up
    Is the power creep really that bad?  


Haven't reached endgame yet.
        Not massively bad.

Certainly enough to build a decent team before powercreep happens, but more than her other 2 sisters. 

But if you play from a pvp centric game or other game with powercreep frequently happening, certainly Honkai is on the better side.
            I'm used to MMOs devaluing everything I farmed every 1 or 2 years completely.  


I also don't plan on competing with meta players.  


Just experiencing the story, pulling valks I like & playing good content.
                Yeah then you good. I mean with even end game stuff, if you dial down your expectation to something like Agony in Abyss or around 15% MA or semething, you could still make powercrept valks (Note, they are not too old) work. If you dial that down even more, any valk works. 

Powercreep is mostly for like RL abyss or something like 2% MA.
                sadly f2p are forced to if they we want an upkeep for crystal (former agony 3 to nirvana retainer here)

it wasn't this bad in the past tbh, and some are even improved too but sadly the meta game is strict and getting stricter with every patch and no amount of free HoV, VKE, AK, MC, DBJ or FR will fix that in the long run. We just accept it at that point and it'll be one of those gacha again and push through.

I thought ER was the hope for us but it only lasted for a while till the high resistance and immunities came...
                If you only plan on playing story, meta doesn't matter at all. Story gives you the valks to play with past a certain point
        It’s awful and a massive problem, old characters are seriously outclassed in almost every regard to modern characters. The only three I can think of that even hold a candle to being viable in the modern game is Azure Empyrea, Flamescion and Herrscher of Thunder.
            Dea Anchora is still decent, same for HoR. And both released before the 3 you mentioned iirc.
                I’ll give you Anchora but nobody uses HoR anymore mate.
                    Her divine key made her pretty much necessary for her bosses. Noone else can break those shields. And against Bio ice enemies she still outperforms both sw and HoHe.
                    I did, and so many other people also.

HoR still top scores quite a few bosses and is also a decent performer on any other ice weather and on type counter weather against bio enemies.
                    We got s2 for free(extra breach which is huge) and her new gears made her viable on nirvana even if she is only s2 (assuming every other support gear is maxed)
        It didn't use to be that bad, but lately they've decided to put in new mechanics that need specific characters (the newest characters) to counter. It made memorial abyss total ass.
        Think of it like this.
There used to be a very good ICE valk And it was Apho Bronya.

She was good.
And Other ice support Valk were good like pardofelis and haxxor bronie (If you saw silverwolf, she is basically that but only bronya size.)

The team combination used to be a staple.

Hohe Elyia arrived replacing Apho Bronya because miss little pink herscherr was better.
Sushang and Kira replaced the Pardo and Bronie.

thus changing the meta

If the game is about Meta and want to Apho bronya to be on the top, no one else would try to pull for other ice valk. Or every patch would be replaced with a better ice valk.

Both situations is worse as mostly everyone else would be burn out.

Powercreep is there sadly but it is a good way to make players play other  and newer valks if they are just concerned about Meta.


For me, i just want to play the game, pull the valks, weapon i want and enjoy the story despite how convoluted it can get.

I came here to enjoy, not get burn myself out.


Play the game not for the meta but for everything else.


One of my gripes with it is that the crystal require to pull is kinda high.

280 crystals just for a single pull.....
            Same here. I'm aiming for enjoyment.  


I'll keep try harding to other apsects of my life.
        It is. Go into Abyss with a F2P team and you’re going to seriously struggle to make it out of Agony tier, much less into Nirvana. Now if you solely play for story/events, just about any team will be fine. But if you want to do anything competitive like Abyss or Memorial arena, you want to keep up with the meta, which shifts pretty much every time a new unit comes out. And they come out so fast that you won’t have enough time to save enough crystals to get the new Valk+her weapon+stigs.
        [deleted]
            Yeah, I haven't seen a single male char yet.  


I'm not a fan of powercreep but if I can get 100h of enjoyment out of this game it's worth it for me.  


If I hit a wall that either requires a ton of grinding, thats beyond reasonable or like you mentioned an absurd amount of pulling I'll  stop.
                You can bypass over 100h easily with the story+events.   


Abyss and memorial are fun, you need to know the bosses, some of them actually have decent mechanics. But lately they went too far with restrictions.   
But same with genshin - highest difficulty is not that much different from lower ranks in terms of rewards.   


Getting to the point of agony3 - Rl -agony3 jumping in and out will bring you the majority of abyss gems.   
In order to retain lotus  all the time and going to nirvana costs much more crystalls, and you won't make it back just from ranking higher.  Mainly for bragging rights.   


ER is honestly the most unique mode, it has roguelike features (hsr's sim universe comes from here) .  It gives specific movesets and builds only for this mode.  Most of the results are coming from your understanding how to make a build.  But recently they started bringing heavy resistances, some immunities, fat shields and just raw hp .   
It's still good and exciting for a while.  The only non-pvp activity.
                    Looking forward to it!
    Too much powercreep is definitely not driving people away.

In fact you could argue that it's better to have more powercreep if you want to get more players. You won't ever disappoint new players who joined because they like some character's design.
        Did you meant powercreep as in players who don’t care about it can get the older valks for cheap?

That’s one way of seeing it ig

I would be fine with a one year powercreep if their weapons/stigmatas were optional but everything else is a no no

You will need at least 6 months to gear a team and if the team members weren’t just released then chances are they’ll get powercrept by the time you complete them

Idk what’s the fun in that for new players
            I mean that, imagine you're a new player and you join this game, only for people to tell you "actually all the upcoming banners for the next 3 months are not that great and you're wasting resources pulling on them".

Increasing powercreep means that new players will rarely feel like they're missing out.

Additionally, imagine if there was no powercreep at all, and a new player joins and you go "Oh yeah the gacha meta operators are HoV, HoRb, Senti, BKE, PE, Hare, Stygian Nymph..."

Powercreep means there's fewer meta operators, which allows new players to catch up. Otherwise it's completely impossible for new players to compete with older ones. 

Of course I'd rather have less powercreep, but it does help to get new players
                [deleted]
                    You don't get what I'm saying.

I'm not saying I want more powercreep. Powercreep hurts long-time players. However, the benefit of powercreep, and the reason why a small amount is essential, is that it lets newer players catch up easily. Hence powercreep makes the game worse for older players but better for newer players.

This is in response to your reply saying that the excess powercreep is what drives away new players. So I'm not saying that powercreep succeeds in making the game good, only that it succeeds in reducing the churn rate of new players (which is the topic on hand). 

So for my argument, how happy veteran players is is of literally no concern, yet you keep talking about it. 

The point is that powercreep is a bigger problem for older players than newer players. New players do not have the old, less powerful units, hence powercreep basically doesn't affect them. This essentially "nerfs" the game for new players. 

Let's say that 12 new Valkyrie are released one after another and currently, only those 12 are in the meta. An old player has played for 3 years. An old player only started just before these 12 valks got released. 

They both have similar crystal incomes (new players have one-time sources of crystals to make up for placing lower due to their bad teams). 

Let's say both of them can build 6 of those 12 characters. The old player can have 2 meta teams and 2 subpar teams that can retain but not climb up Agony 3. The new player can have 2 meta teams and 2 really bad teams, however he can just use his 2 meta teams even when the weather doesn't favor them, and he can still retain Agony 3.

In this way, the new player can do just as well as the old player. 

As I said, I'm not arguing that this is good for veteran players, but it certainly is good for new players. 

And as I mentioned earlier, a decent amount of players may decide to play HI3 because of one particular character, and if they realize it is not meta, it doesn't feel good and it increases the chance they drop the game. Naturally, new players are rarely drawn in by really old characters (because they'd have seen them on those characters' release and start playing then, not a year later), so if we assume a decent chunk of new players are drawn in by new characters, if they any new characters aren't worth pulling, that increases the chances of new players leaving.

So if powercreep really is the problem in HI3, the problem wouldn't be "Why does HI3 fails to attract and keep new players" but rather "Why do people keep quitting HI3"
            As a new player (started during 5.4) it was great not having to chase old valks besides HoS. I only pulled for New stuff and could easily compete in RL and get the 7% MA with it. Low Powercreep can resuit in waiting for a long time for old units to rerun that are better than newer ones. As it was SW carried me through 3-4 patches until I had some teams built. I didn't have a phys team until HoRb and my lightning is still kinda weak With mobius, S rank HoT and HoO but I got by fine by just using off teams with type advantage on abyss. Like using sw on All the psy lightning content during aponia banner.
I think that Hoyoverse thinks the same things you said and that's why the already announced a complete graphic, engine and UI overrall scheduled for next year
    They did?  


That sounds great.
        Apparently they're doing an undisclosed beta test in Loas Angeles and I'm guessing is to let a few selected people try it out
            Link?
        Here is a video of the beta footage for the engine update 

https://youtu.be/k0REycu4acQ?si=CR1_BvcFJNQlFMeJ
    Well that's a first, did they show any preview of the updated UI?
        Nope, it’s all a secret for now, we know these new updates are gonna be hitting on spring 2024 when Part 2 drops
Bro as someone that plays Genshin, Star Rail and HI3rd i can tell without a doubt the Honkai Impact is the superior game.
    Idk i think the game has many problems... As much as the others however it makes up for it in some ways.
    Oh? Wouldn't you mind share us why did you reach this conclusion?
        It's just my own opinion as a player of all three but hoyo are really putting more effort to Honkai. new story chapter every version, new events with unique gameplay mechanics (like shenzou and tericula events this version), more endgame content, better gameplay mechanics and while in Genshin the focus of the game is Teyvat as The Traveler tarvels and meet new people in Honkai the focus is on the cast and how they develop and grow, the best example of this is [this ](https://m.hoyolab.com/#/article/16136773)
Honkai gets vocal songs and anime cutscenes for saga finales and each one of them hits hard inside your soul, final boss battles in Honkai also carry more weight than in Genshin, I felt more in awe at Vita boss fight than Raiden Shogun boss fight. Now obviously which game is better is entirely subjective so feel free to discuss and throw some counter arguments.
            I can feel the love going into honkai, compared to genshin and star rail.  


It has more soul to it.
We’re going to have a lot of overhaul system wise and graphic wise when story part 2 opens (around April next year) so save your judgement until then

Bringing comics to in-game would be nice but it would be increase the storage size for little value, the current implementation is already pretty good (if you click on the little button on the bottom right when selecting a story chapter there would be a summary of the prev story and links to the relevant comics) MHY just need to actually translate the VN so we get full context of the background knowledge stuffs (yes i know hoyostans already translated some of them but official translation would be nice)

In terms of powercreep it would depend on who you want to play with and how high do you want to be in the ladder

If you want to play with year 1 valk, well goodluck those valk already struggle on red lotus even when paired with modern supports and max equipment. If you want to play with valks that were released after that then results may vary for example character like stygian nymph is useless on abyss even if she is max rank full gear her playstyle also doesnt match with the modern support (SN was designed when impair only last 8s and now impair can last up to 30s not to mention she is still not farmable) on the other hand HoR got a brand new gear set last year and she is farmable so currently she is still viable even on nirvana (the highest ladder rank)

Old DPS is either a hit or a miss while old supports are all miss (old gen support just cant compete to their newer counterparts)

For example lets talk about impair supports, impair reduces enemy defense stat which is crucial for physical valkyries to do damage

The first gen impair is Divine Prayer, when she is off field she will target 1 enemy randomly and apply 80% impair for 6s every 10s seems decent for boss fight, horrible for mobbing (abyss during this era is mostly mob spam)

The 2nd gen impair support is celestial hymn, her ult inflicts 75% impair for 10s to all enemies and she gathers for the impair duration(SP/energy farming on her is pretty painful)

The 3rd gen impair support is herrscher of sentience, she has 2 source of impair her spear combo inflicts 50% impair for 10s and gathers enemy, her ult inflicts 75% impair for 15s and her pillar combo has (pretty much) global gather, senti has a really good SP regen

The 4th gen impair support is herrscher of rebirth she only has 1 impair source which is her ult(75% impair) but the duration can be extended to 30s and during her ult she grants guaranteed crit to everyone, as long as youre hitting your buttons at the right time she will never run out of SP

For most physical teams senti is already relegated to 2nd tier impair source, the only team where she is still competitive is on bleed team but thats mostly because we dont have a lot of options for bleed support gear

Modern Supports give way more buffs and require less field time compared to their older counterparts and to combat this enemies have gotten tankier and their tankiness scaled much faster these days

While on the highest ladder only very few valkyries are considered viable on lower ladders the viable pool gets wider, if i were to summarize how the meta looks on each ladder

Forbidden : anything goes, you can do solo valk run here

Sinful : anything goes, triple dps with shit gear is still viable

Agony : most DPS is viable as long as you have modern supports (current gen or previous gen) with farmable gears (if you want to be comfy on agony/rank up to redlotus every DPS needs their weapon)

Redlotus : DPS pool shrunk, older DPS needs rank ups, supports wants their gacha gear (generally you want only 1 valk on farmable support gear to reduce the required skill floor for a good score)

Nirvana : even current gen DPS wants rank ups, full gacha gear on every valk, ELF gap is real

Myriad (top 100 players on every server) : pretty much whale only zone, some people said that f2p can still reach it but it requires very meticulous account planning (pulled on 1 wrong banner, bye bye myriad)
    Thank you for taking the time to write all of this down.  


I can feel the struggle with my beginner valks.  


I'm looking forward to everything they are cooking up
Whoever said HI3 is inferior to GI or HSR.
    Read & heard it quite a few times across social media.
        Lol those are coming from star rail and genshin players, storywise honkai is objectively better than both
            hi3 has its own issues with the story lol
        Lol, who would consider the absolutely cringe plots and characters of those 2 as superior to HI3?
who said it was?
Only thing that holds this game back is the older mobile game jank format 

Really hoping that the 7.0 update or sequel will fix a lot of this
    It won't be in 7.0.  It'll be around the beginning of next year when Part 2 of the story begins
Until we get that update HI3 will always be the most outdated of the Mihoyo games and that's a fact.
The only problem I have with honkai impact is that it’s so much reading. It’s like playing a light novel with some gaming aspects on the side.
    I can see that bothering the younger folk or people who love to see animation and audio rather than reading, feels like it breaks the pace of the game
        Not sure why you think that younger folk are adverse to reading lol. There’s always a large amount of people who just don’t like to read.
Three are altogether different types of games. HI 3 is not open world or strategy like Genshin or Star rail.
HI3 issues arent apparent until a month in. I used to think like yourself. Now Im about to drop HI3. It was very fun at first. It still is quite fun, but now it became a chore.
To be honest, I can't see Honkai as inferior. Is a product of it's own time, back when Mobile games started to slowly rise in popularity with the arrival of FGO.

To be fair, the plot and lore made the game very interesting to follow, and the gameplay was very stylish, with a good cast of playable characters, all of them memorable

Ultimately, Honkai Impact 3rd walked so that Genshin Impact could run. Without the success of Honkai Impact 3rd in SEA and China, Mihoyo most likely wouldn't have gotten where they are now.

Hell, is funny I will say this, because this reminds me of another case, this time, within the Fighting game Blazblue and Arcsys works. without Blazblue, Arcsys wouldn't have been were they are now, given they had lost the rights to the Guilty Gear franchise for a time.

Come of thinking, Honkai Impact 3rd and Blazblue does have in terms of lore and concepts some striking similarities.
Played all 3. It's the best of all 3.
    I do. And I enjoy them. Genshin the least for now. HI 3 and Star Rails are a tie for me for different aspects.
While this game does indeed have powercreep like a traditional gacha game.. imo, the powercreep has calmed A BIT down. Not saying that powercreep is outright gone but rather that you absolutely DO NOT NEED to pull for each and every new character.

Context, I started 2020 during the height of HI3rd's Naruto vs Sasuke arc. 3 years later in 2023, I sit comfortably in Red Lotus and I just half ass Memorial Arena. MA is the time attack mode so there's literally no punishment for low scoring.

For Superstring/Abyss, again, you absolutly DO NOT need each and every new character. I completely skipped out on Hare 0/4 gears, Susannah is free but only got 1 stig/4 gears, Kira is free but 0/4 gears. Hell I will even say that my Quantum and Bleed teams are absolute dog shit and so I usually lose 100 points in the ladder but I know when the next Abyss rotation comes around, I almost always make back those lost 100 points.

Last year, I skipped out Pardo gears 0/4, Griseo gears 1/4. Completly skipped out on Aponia and Vill-V just to get Human-Elysia 4/4

Pro tip for Superstring/Abyss... videos on ytube with really good people using f2p teams and stigs to score high and/or maintain Abyss ranking.

For the dated UI and presentation, we should be getting the new game engine early 2024 to freshin up HI3rd and bring it to more modern standards. I believe it should be the same engine that ZZZ uses.
Definitely not inferior, if anything it’s my favorite. It’s literally the hoyoverse favorite child. You will never find a singular character with as much detail and interesting story than half the honkai cast in any other hoyoverse game. Just because the UI is outdated and there isn’t any real open world doesn’t make the game bad, it only makes it different and for a different audience.
    I'm stoked to learn more about the characters. I'm enjoying the story at snails pace and read every manga.
        It only gets better with time!! The Elysian realm arc is my personal favorite 💜
Agree, UI is by far the thing that needs to be redone, it is now how many years old? 5 6 years old?
    Nearing it's 7th year. First launched in 2016.
It's never been.....it just a niche game that caters more likely to dolphin and whale since powercreep happens every patch
I wouldn't say HI3 is inferior, but instead it is old + true gacha game.  GI and HSR has a huge dev budget, player base and more profits than HI3 ever did.  (I think GI / HSR main Reddit got more followers in 1 month than all three of HI3's Reddit over several years.)  Most likely old HI3 will never catch up to GI & HSR:

GI & HSR more casual F2P and dolphin friendly.  They give tons of free premium currency (primos / stellar jade).  The OG 4\* of GI (Bennett, Xingling, Xingqui, Fischl, Surcrose) still powerful after all these years.  No competitive mode in those games.

HI3 gacha 1 pull cost more:  280 crystals = 1 pull.  GI & HSR gacha:  160 primo or stellar jade = 1 pull.  You could say that the "gear" system in HI3 is better because there is no RNG like GI & HSR artifacts, so it justifies a higher pull cost.  But that's a problem itself:  knowing that your awesome valk is crippled because you only have 3/4 gears or less.

If you care about doing well in HI3 endgame competitive Abyss, power creep is real.  Expect your expensive HI3 DPS valk to be non-meta in 1-year.  Expect HI3 supports to be outdated in 2 years.  In Nirvana Abyss (the highest tier of HI3 Abyss), you basically have to whale to get multiple SS+ ranks on your DPS, Supports, and ELFs while they are still viable in the meta.  If you lower your competitive expectations much lower, you will spend less $.

Lack of an English dub hurts HI3 in the entire world.  I doubt Mihoyo gonna spend their millions of dollars to re-dub all HI3 voice lines into English.  However, HSR has English Voice actors for Himeko, Bronya, & Welt.  In GI, Nahida, Raiden Shogun, and Sustainer of Heavenly Principles can be HI3 English Voices of Teri, Mei, and Kiana.

I think the best HI3 should do is to retain it's existing player base who have already accepted it's pros and cons.  There is a new in-game graphics engine being worked on for HI3.  Mihoyo released a demo video of it with Ai-Chan running around an open world city.  It might draw in some new players.

CEO of Mihoyo DaWei recently said that HI3 is still his favorite child.  When HI3 came out all those years ago, Mihoyo was much smaller and didn't have the resources make the game as grand as they wanted.  But now they have gazillions of dollars from GI & HSR, so surely they will put a few millions back into HI3?
    Yeah I noticed the gacha is more expensive.  


I enjoy it for now and there are a ton of valk fragments to farm and valks to try.  


I'm having fun and can see myself playing it for a long time.
    That and it gets its own anime. not for the whole part 1. Just enough to straighten the lores out. It gets honestly a little too confusing for my taste.

Golden Courtyard and Cooking with Valkyrie exists but Story lore explanation hopefully makes it better to clear things up.
Graphics up to par? The hell do you mean all of their games look like they use the exact same engine, and Honkai Impact is older so that would mean they took HI's engine
Tbh i keep reading people mentioning powercreep being too harsh which isn't true mostly people aren't informed. HoT, HoR, HoF, HoS all pretty old and still meta. S rank supports are releveant for at least 2.5 years. A ranks supports around 1-1.5 years (eden fiscl griseo pardo carole etc). And anyone whose seen the overall dps comparisons for dps over the years its been a very small increase i.e DA who is 3 years old averages out at 12M per rotation while the next fire dps MMG sirin is at 13M sliggtly under HoF whose at 13-13.5M if she's S0.Powercreep isn't existent outside top 100 all dps or supports valks work if you properly support them. Tons of people make yt vids clearing with old valks. Supports also can be dps. Most people just here nirvana players specifically top 100 mention the new valk does something better and jump on this train. 

Also S0 trio averages about 12.3M per cycle which is lower than most dps supported by the usual valks. Trio is just extremely tike efficient but has sp issues if Hotr is S0 for longer rots

Powercreep does exist but is handled well for the general player base outside top 100 and nirvana retention which gives like 20 crystals more than redlotus
Next spring they’re rolling out an updated graphics engine and I expect working on the GUI.  We can probably expect some interesting things in star rail around then because they’re going to release apho3 as well.
    I googled it and it looks insane.
        Lots to look forward to for sure 🤩
People saying that honkai impact is inferior are weird.
Honkai has chibis with gun and bombs. 😁😁😁
Thanks for taking your time to write this.  


Very good points.   


I see... The issues are quite challenging.  


There is another one that just came to mind.  


Competition is getting fiercer every year.  


People would rather try new games than old ones.   


I recently saw a video with upcoming gachas, and the market seems really competitive.
It's also not dubbed nor subbed in any other languages, it's so weird the game it's only japanese and Chinese voices and English, Chinese, Japanese, Corean and I think French but not Spanish (for example) the 4th most spoken language in the world
The powercreep every parch thing is misinformation because we have valks who are or have been meta for over 2.5 years lol
    still, nothing is better as phy dmg as new seele... power creep is real, we just have other options
I never realized that it wasn't voiced since I always play in CN dub. Surprised hoyo didn't dub it as well in JP
    Main story are dubbed in both CN and JP, except for some few exceptions which happens more because of logistics and contract reasons than no plan to dub it.

Events on the other hand though, are only dubbed in CN with JP dub CG (don't ask why). Some events, rare as they are, are dubbed in JP. So honestly JP dub are like a wierd thing in events.
I think one of the biggest issues is the lack of an English dub. Dubs go so far to make things more accessible to English-only speakers, in my case I have pretty severe ADHD and as a result sitting down to play honkai and read the story is more of an undertaking than it is in genshin. I still power through because at first I was very driven by my love of genshin and since then I’ve fallen in love with the story in its own right, but I fall behind a lot since I can’t easily put the cutscenes on auto and do something with my hands to help me pay better attention
Only one that can go against this is nikke …but nikke brings in the lewd ahha
Is the power creep really that bad?  


Haven't reached endgame yet.
    Not massively bad.

Certainly enough to build a decent team before powercreep happens, but more than her other 2 sisters. 

But if you play from a pvp centric game or other game with powercreep frequently happening, certainly Honkai is on the better side.
        I'm used to MMOs devaluing everything I farmed every 1 or 2 years completely.  


I also don't plan on competing with meta players.  


Just experiencing the story, pulling valks I like & playing good content.
            Yeah then you good. I mean with even end game stuff, if you dial down your expectation to something like Agony in Abyss or around 15% MA or semething, you could still make powercrept valks (Note, they are not too old) work. If you dial that down even more, any valk works. 

Powercreep is mostly for like RL abyss or something like 2% MA.
            sadly f2p are forced to if they we want an upkeep for crystal (former agony 3 to nirvana retainer here)

it wasn't this bad in the past tbh, and some are even improved too but sadly the meta game is strict and getting stricter with every patch and no amount of free HoV, VKE, AK, MC, DBJ or FR will fix that in the long run. We just accept it at that point and it'll be one of those gacha again and push through.

I thought ER was the hope for us but it only lasted for a while till the high resistance and immunities came...
            If you only plan on playing story, meta doesn't matter at all. Story gives you the valks to play with past a certain point
    It’s awful and a massive problem, old characters are seriously outclassed in almost every regard to modern characters. The only three I can think of that even hold a candle to being viable in the modern game is Azure Empyrea, Flamescion and Herrscher of Thunder.
        Dea Anchora is still decent, same for HoR. And both released before the 3 you mentioned iirc.
            I’ll give you Anchora but nobody uses HoR anymore mate.
                Her divine key made her pretty much necessary for her bosses. Noone else can break those shields. And against Bio ice enemies she still outperforms both sw and HoHe.
                I did, and so many other people also.

HoR still top scores quite a few bosses and is also a decent performer on any other ice weather and on type counter weather against bio enemies.
                We got s2 for free(extra breach which is huge) and her new gears made her viable on nirvana even if she is only s2 (assuming every other support gear is maxed)
    It didn't use to be that bad, but lately they've decided to put in new mechanics that need specific characters (the newest characters) to counter. It made memorial abyss total ass.
    Think of it like this.
There used to be a very good ICE valk And it was Apho Bronya.

She was good.
And Other ice support Valk were good like pardofelis and haxxor bronie (If you saw silverwolf, she is basically that but only bronya size.)

The team combination used to be a staple.

Hohe Elyia arrived replacing Apho Bronya because miss little pink herscherr was better.
Sushang and Kira replaced the Pardo and Bronie.

thus changing the meta

If the game is about Meta and want to Apho bronya to be on the top, no one else would try to pull for other ice valk. Or every patch would be replaced with a better ice valk.

Both situations is worse as mostly everyone else would be burn out.

Powercreep is there sadly but it is a good way to make players play other  and newer valks if they are just concerned about Meta.


For me, i just want to play the game, pull the valks, weapon i want and enjoy the story despite how convoluted it can get.

I came here to enjoy, not get burn myself out.


Play the game not for the meta but for everything else.


One of my gripes with it is that the crystal require to pull is kinda high.

280 crystals just for a single pull.....
        Same here. I'm aiming for enjoyment.  


I'll keep try harding to other apsects of my life.
    It is. Go into Abyss with a F2P team and you’re going to seriously struggle to make it out of Agony tier, much less into Nirvana. Now if you solely play for story/events, just about any team will be fine. But if you want to do anything competitive like Abyss or Memorial arena, you want to keep up with the meta, which shifts pretty much every time a new unit comes out. And they come out so fast that you won’t have enough time to save enough crystals to get the new Valk+her weapon+stigs.
    [deleted]
        Yeah, I haven't seen a single male char yet.  


I'm not a fan of powercreep but if I can get 100h of enjoyment out of this game it's worth it for me.  


If I hit a wall that either requires a ton of grinding, thats beyond reasonable or like you mentioned an absurd amount of pulling I'll  stop.
            You can bypass over 100h easily with the story+events.   


Abyss and memorial are fun, you need to know the bosses, some of them actually have decent mechanics. But lately they went too far with restrictions.   
But same with genshin - highest difficulty is not that much different from lower ranks in terms of rewards.   


Getting to the point of agony3 - Rl -agony3 jumping in and out will bring you the majority of abyss gems.   
In order to retain lotus  all the time and going to nirvana costs much more crystalls, and you won't make it back just from ranking higher.  Mainly for bragging rights.   


ER is honestly the most unique mode, it has roguelike features (hsr's sim universe comes from here) .  It gives specific movesets and builds only for this mode.  Most of the results are coming from your understanding how to make a build.  But recently they started bringing heavy resistances, some immunities, fat shields and just raw hp .   
It's still good and exciting for a while.  The only non-pvp activity.
                Looking forward to it!
Too much powercreep is definitely not driving people away.

In fact you could argue that it's better to have more powercreep if you want to get more players. You won't ever disappoint new players who joined because they like some character's design.
    Did you meant powercreep as in players who don’t care about it can get the older valks for cheap?

That’s one way of seeing it ig

I would be fine with a one year powercreep if their weapons/stigmatas were optional but everything else is a no no

You will need at least 6 months to gear a team and if the team members weren’t just released then chances are they’ll get powercrept by the time you complete them

Idk what’s the fun in that for new players
        I mean that, imagine you're a new player and you join this game, only for people to tell you "actually all the upcoming banners for the next 3 months are not that great and you're wasting resources pulling on them".

Increasing powercreep means that new players will rarely feel like they're missing out.

Additionally, imagine if there was no powercreep at all, and a new player joins and you go "Oh yeah the gacha meta operators are HoV, HoRb, Senti, BKE, PE, Hare, Stygian Nymph..."

Powercreep means there's fewer meta operators, which allows new players to catch up. Otherwise it's completely impossible for new players to compete with older ones. 

Of course I'd rather have less powercreep, but it does help to get new players
            [deleted]
                You don't get what I'm saying.

I'm not saying I want more powercreep. Powercreep hurts long-time players. However, the benefit of powercreep, and the reason why a small amount is essential, is that it lets newer players catch up easily. Hence powercreep makes the game worse for older players but better for newer players.

This is in response to your reply saying that the excess powercreep is what drives away new players. So I'm not saying that powercreep succeeds in making the game good, only that it succeeds in reducing the churn rate of new players (which is the topic on hand). 

So for my argument, how happy veteran players is is of literally no concern, yet you keep talking about it. 

The point is that powercreep is a bigger problem for older players than newer players. New players do not have the old, less powerful units, hence powercreep basically doesn't affect them. This essentially "nerfs" the game for new players. 

Let's say that 12 new Valkyrie are released one after another and currently, only those 12 are in the meta. An old player has played for 3 years. An old player only started just before these 12 valks got released. 

They both have similar crystal incomes (new players have one-time sources of crystals to make up for placing lower due to their bad teams). 

Let's say both of them can build 6 of those 12 characters. The old player can have 2 meta teams and 2 subpar teams that can retain but not climb up Agony 3. The new player can have 2 meta teams and 2 really bad teams, however he can just use his 2 meta teams even when the weather doesn't favor them, and he can still retain Agony 3.

In this way, the new player can do just as well as the old player. 

As I said, I'm not arguing that this is good for veteran players, but it certainly is good for new players. 

And as I mentioned earlier, a decent amount of players may decide to play HI3 because of one particular character, and if they realize it is not meta, it doesn't feel good and it increases the chance they drop the game. Naturally, new players are rarely drawn in by really old characters (because they'd have seen them on those characters' release and start playing then, not a year later), so if we assume a decent chunk of new players are drawn in by new characters, if they any new characters aren't worth pulling, that increases the chances of new players leaving.

So if powercreep really is the problem in HI3, the problem wouldn't be "Why does HI3 fails to attract and keep new players" but rather "Why do people keep quitting HI3"
        As a new player (started during 5.4) it was great not having to chase old valks besides HoS. I only pulled for New stuff and could easily compete in RL and get the 7% MA with it. Low Powercreep can resuit in waiting for a long time for old units to rerun that are better than newer ones. As it was SW carried me through 3-4 patches until I had some teams built. I didn't have a phys team until HoRb and my lightning is still kinda weak With mobius, S rank HoT and HoO but I got by fine by just using off teams with type advantage on abyss. Like using sw on All the psy lightning content during aponia banner.
They did?  


That sounds great.
    Apparently they're doing an undisclosed beta test in Loas Angeles and I'm guessing is to let a few selected people try it out
        Link?
    Here is a video of the beta footage for the engine update 

https://youtu.be/k0REycu4acQ?si=CR1_BvcFJNQlFMeJ
Well that's a first, did they show any preview of the updated UI?
    Nope, it’s all a secret for now, we know these new updates are gonna be hitting on spring 2024 when Part 2 drops
Idk i think the game has many problems... As much as the others however it makes up for it in some ways.
Oh? Wouldn't you mind share us why did you reach this conclusion?
    It's just my own opinion as a player of all three but hoyo are really putting more effort to Honkai. new story chapter every version, new events with unique gameplay mechanics (like shenzou and tericula events this version), more endgame content, better gameplay mechanics and while in Genshin the focus of the game is Teyvat as The Traveler tarvels and meet new people in Honkai the focus is on the cast and how they develop and grow, the best example of this is [this ](https://m.hoyolab.com/#/article/16136773)
Honkai gets vocal songs and anime cutscenes for saga finales and each one of them hits hard inside your soul, final boss battles in Honkai also carry more weight than in Genshin, I felt more in awe at Vita boss fight than Raiden Shogun boss fight. Now obviously which game is better is entirely subjective so feel free to discuss and throw some counter arguments.
        I can feel the love going into honkai, compared to genshin and star rail.  


It has more soul to it.
Thank you for taking the time to write all of this down.  


I can feel the struggle with my beginner valks.  


I'm looking forward to everything they are cooking up
Read & heard it quite a few times across social media.
    Lol those are coming from star rail and genshin players, storywise honkai is objectively better than both
        hi3 has its own issues with the story lol
    Lol, who would consider the absolutely cringe plots and characters of those 2 as superior to HI3?
It won't be in 7.0.  It'll be around the beginning of next year when Part 2 of the story begins
I can see that bothering the younger folk or people who love to see animation and audio rather than reading, feels like it breaks the pace of the game
    Not sure why you think that younger folk are adverse to reading lol. There’s always a large amount of people who just don’t like to read.
I do. And I enjoy them. Genshin the least for now. HI 3 and Star Rails are a tie for me for different aspects.
I'm stoked to learn more about the characters. I'm enjoying the story at snails pace and read every manga.
    It only gets better with time!! The Elysian realm arc is my personal favorite 💜
Nearing it's 7th year. First launched in 2016.
Yeah I noticed the gacha is more expensive.  


I enjoy it for now and there are a ton of valk fragments to farm and valks to try.  


I'm having fun and can see myself playing it for a long time.
That and it gets its own anime. not for the whole part 1. Just enough to straighten the lores out. It gets honestly a little too confusing for my taste.

Golden Courtyard and Cooking with Valkyrie exists but Story lore explanation hopefully makes it better to clear things up.
I googled it and it looks insane.
    Lots to look forward to for sure 🤩
still, nothing is better as phy dmg as new seele... power creep is real, we just have other options
Main story are dubbed in both CN and JP, except for some few exceptions which happens more because of logistics and contract reasons than no plan to dub it.

Most of the results are coming from your understanding how to make a build.  But recently they started bringing heavy resistances, some immunities, fat shields and just raw hp .   
It's still good and exciting for a while.  The only non-pvp activity.
        Looking forward to it!
I mean that, imagine you're a new player and you join this game, only for people to tell you "actually all the upcoming banners for the next 3 months are not that great and you're wasting resources pulling on them".

Increasing powercreep means that new players will rarely feel like they're missing out.

Additionally, imagine if there was no powercreep at all, and a new player joins and you go "Oh yeah the gacha meta operators are HoV, HoRb, Senti, BKE, PE, Hare, Stygian Nymph..."

Powercreep means there's fewer meta operators, which allows new players to catch up. Otherwise it's completely impossible for new players to compete with older ones. 

Of course I'd rather have less powercreep, but it does help to get new players

        You don't get what I'm saying.

I'm not saying I want more powercreep. Powercreep hurts long-time players. However, the benefit of powercreep, and the reason why a small amount is essential, is that it lets newer players catch up easily. Hence powercreep makes the game worse for older players but better for newer players.

This is in response to your reply saying that the excess powercreep is what drives away new players. So I'm not saying that powercreep succeeds in making the game good, only that it succeeds in reducing the churn rate of new players (which is the topic on hand). 

So for my argument, how happy veteran players is is of literally no concern, yet you keep talking about it. 

The point is that powercreep is a bigger problem for older players than newer players. New players do not have the old, less powerful units, hence powercreep basically doesn't affect them. This essentially "nerfs" the game for new players. 

Let's say that 12 new Valkyrie are released one after another and currently, only those 12 are in the meta. An old player has played for 3 years. An old player only started just before these 12 valks got released. 

They both have similar crystal incomes (new players have one-time sources of crystals to make up for placing lower due to their bad teams). 

Let's say both of them can build 6 of those 12 characters. The old player can have 2 meta teams and 2 subpar teams that can retain but not climb up Agony 3. The new player can have 2 meta teams and 2 really bad teams, however he can just use his 2 meta teams even when the weather doesn't favor them, and he can still retain Agony 3.

In this way, the new player can do just as well as the old player. 

As I said, I'm not arguing that this is good for veteran players, but it certainly is good for new players. 

And as I mentioned earlier, a decent amount of players may decide to play HI3 because of one particular character, and if they realize it is not meta, it doesn't feel good and it increases the chance they drop the game. Naturally, new players are rarely drawn in by really old characters (because they'd have seen them on those characters' release and start playing then, not a year later), so if we assume a decent chunk of new players are drawn in by new characters, if they any new characters aren't worth pulling, that increases the chances of new players leaving.

So if powercreep really is the problem in HI3, the problem wouldn't be "Why does HI3 fails to attract and keep new players" but rather "Why do people keep quitting HI3"
As a new player (started during 5.4) it was great not having to chase old valks besides HoS. I only pulled for New stuff and could easily compete in RL and get the 7% MA with it. Low Powercreep can resuit in waiting for a long time for old units to rerun that are better than newer ones. As it was SW carried me through 3-4 patches until I had some teams built. I didn't have a phys team until HoRb and my lightning is still kinda weak With mobius, S rank HoT and HoO but I got by fine by just using off teams with type advantage on abyss. Like using sw on All the psy lightning content during aponia banner.
Link?
I can feel the love going into honkai, compared to genshin and star rail.  


It has more soul to it.
hi3 has its own issues with the story lol
Yeah then you good. I mean with even end game stuff, if you dial down your expectation to something like Agony in Abyss or around 15% MA or semething, you could still make powercrept valks (Note, they are not too old) work. If you dial that down even more, any valk works. 

Powercreep is mostly for like RL abyss or something like 2% MA.
sadly f2p are forced to if they we want an upkeep for crystal (former agony 3 to nirvana retainer here)

it wasn't this bad in the past tbh, and some are even improved too but sadly the meta game is strict and getting stricter with every patch and no amount of free HoV, VKE, AK, MC, DBJ or FR will fix that in the long run. We just accept it at that point and it'll be one of those gacha again and push through.

I thought ER was the hope for us but it only lasted for a while till the high resistance and immunities came...
If you only plan on playing story, meta doesn't matter at all. Story gives you the valks to play with past a certain point
I’ll give you Anchora but nobody uses HoR anymore mate.
    Her divine key made her pretty much necessary for her bosses. Noone else can break those shields. And against Bio ice enemies she still outperforms both sw and HoHe.
    I did, and so many other people also.

HoR still top scores quite a few bosses and is also a decent performer on any other ice weather and on type counter weather against bio enemies.
    We got s2 for free(extra breach which is huge) and her new gears made her viable on nirvana even if she is only s2 (assuming every other support gear is maxed)
You can bypass over 100h easily with the story+events.   


Abyss and memorial are fun, you need to know the bosses, some of them actually have decent mechanics. But lately they went too far with restrictions.   
But same with genshin - highest difficulty is not that much different from lower ranks in terms of rewards.   


Getting to the point of agony3 - Rl -agony3 jumping in and out will bring you the majority of abyss gems.
