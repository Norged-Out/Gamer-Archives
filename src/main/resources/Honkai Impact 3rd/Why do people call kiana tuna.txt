    No need for words lmao. my mans just dropped a picture, refuse to elaborate and leave. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇüíÄüíÄ this is what I call based.
It's because in Chinese, a lazy person is called a "salty fish". They drew it looking like a tuna though, so the name "tuna" stuck.
    And in Arabic "Kaslana" means "lazy" for describing a female.
    This is the correct answer
    I think [this comic](https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/book/1001/6) was where I first saw it.
    Hmm, what I heard is that it was translated wrongly to tuna
Kiana Kaslana in Chinese Áê™‰∫öÂ®ú¬∑Âç°ÊñØÂÖ∞Â®ú (Qi Ya Na Ka Si Lan Na) does not sound anywhere near tuna in Chinese ÈáëÊû™È±º (Jin Qiang Yu)

The actual reason I think is this
KiaNa KaslaNa ‚Äî> 2 Na ‚Äî> Tuna
As a new player, I want to know it too
    kiaNA kaslaNA -> 2 Na-> Tuna
        Thank you
            check back for the actual cn origins lol. the 2na one was one that originated from en people trying to answer the same question from cn using it so they backwards engineered this reason
For that matter why do people call durandal dudu or goose
    pretty sure the dudu nickname originated from the london holiday manga as a little joke
        Interesting! I always assumed it came from the CN fandom and ‚Äúdudu‚Äù was just the pinyin version that caught on overseas (in Chinese its common to say the first syllable of a name/verb twice to show endearment)
    Not sure about dudu but for the goose part it‚Äôs this.

Durandal in Chinese is ÂπΩÂÖ∞ÈªõÂ∞î (You Lan Dai Er) the last two characters ÈªõÂ∞î sounds similar to ÂëÜÈπÖ(Dai E) which means dumb goose.

Every pinyin spelling has 4 different ways of pronunciation so depending on the tone it will mean different words.

Update:Dudu origin should be spaghettiaddict666‚Äôs theory that it‚Äôs term of endearment
    The Dudu nickname actually originated not from Bianka herself, but to Blade Duranda, the supposedly holy sword that Bianka used to save the bubble universe. It was not the London Holiday manga, but the Visual Novel that all of this transpired. 

If you didn't know, Bianka's "Durandal" nickname came from her using the blade. She basically inherited the name. That would also imply that she would also inherit some of Blade Durandal's nicknames which, if I remember correctly, there were a few of them. 

And yes, one of those nicknames is "Dudu". But here's the catch, I don't quite remember if Blade Durandal's nickname was actually Dudu or just a single Du. Bianka's Dudu might just have naturally evolved from Blade Durandal's Du, because, well, it sounds cuter and more complete that way.
She has fishy intentions
If i am not wrong
It is meme from CN cause Kiana sounds like Tuna in Chinese or something like that
In CN kiana's name sounds like tuna I believe. It either sounds or reads similar to that, then even hoyo joined into the joke
In CN Kianna's name also sounds like the word for tuna so CN fans memed Kiana=Tuna into existence.
I heard she was inspired by a Tuna girl called "Nana"  and like KiaNA = TuNA.

But I don't wanna give out misinformation I just saw a comment, maybe "Nana" was lazy and clumsy and had high pitched voice?
Because Kiana is Tuna and has grown so much since the start of the game and has come so far I remember when people called Kiana fried Tuna because of HoF
Chinese audio pun.
Theres an emote that has Kiana as a Tuna tho
there's a lot of non canon reasons, my favorite is the jojo logic.  


KiaNA kaslaNA
I thought it‚Äôs because she looks like a tuna
