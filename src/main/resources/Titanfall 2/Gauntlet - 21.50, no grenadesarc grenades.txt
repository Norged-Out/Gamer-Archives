[[Gauntlet - 21.50, no grenadesarc grenades]]





The triple kill with that one shot is crazy.
    Had to think of something that would kill at least 2 with the last shot in the EVA, since I wouldn't be able to time the reload with kills that fast

:D
Impressive! Nice work! :P
nice job
Not sure I’ve ever seen anything used besides the Eva used on the gauntlet. Also good job, that triple kill was insane. I practiced for a month just to get the trophy lol
    Thanks! It took about five days to get it on PC, just after completing master difficulty

edit: the achievement, of course
How long did it take to get right?
    This setup? About an hour
頑張ってねぇ！
Nice one pilot
Try doing that with a controller that has stick drift
    That last part has me imagining that a pilot uses a stick shift to change gears
I don't know how you guys manage to go 50kph all the time, I can't go faster than 40
    just a lot of practice, honestly. It's hard to keep the timing right even with practice
Ughhh. The Japanese are so perfect.
    Just a reminder, I'm not Japanese, just an American learning Japanese.
Holy shit is the a single-player mode on Apex?
    Just on the chance its a serious question, this is the gauntlet from the tutorial of the titanfall 2 campaign, which is why it has a lot of the same weapons as apex legends.
        They Have Allot Of Comments On The Apex Subreddit And None Here So Likely A Serious Question.

    why are you downvoted? its funny
how to make this with gamepad?
    To be honest, I don't know. I rarely use controller when it comes to Titanfall 2- just mouse and keyboard.

If you want my settings for controller? Ninja layout, for the grenade on B, and jump and crouch on the bumpers above the triggers. You can change it to however you like though.

Set crouch to hold so you don't keep un-crouching whenever you land (to keep sliding). 

I don't know about this but I usually keep aim-assist off as I don't usually need it. You might though.

I don't know what a good route is for controller though, since you usually land face first into the hanging donut with one.
If never thought of that lower route in the last parts
    I wasn't fast enough to use the pillar with the tree as a platform so I had to go that way
