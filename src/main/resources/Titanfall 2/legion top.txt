...Ire modern solutions
I saw what
    What I don't understand what drives these people.
Fuck..

He couldn't..

.... even ronin put a sword back on hip
This is the...

&#x200B;

Ad got in the way of the post
I like how both posts are...
Born to shit
actual dumptruck ass
Ronin bottom
This is a...
Amouranth's about to top the subscription charts PepeLa
There had to be an ad...

Dummy thicc
    [removed]
        If that comment irritated you, r/titanfall34 will ruin your whole day
it actually fucking worked
I’m so happy I saw the two posts right next to each other
Got split by an ad lol
The narrative that Nagy doesn't run the ball’? It’s not a clone, bit of a stretch for Pain I’d have to contract with SpaceX to have any idea what’s up outside of a calling. In legion I would fly by a lot and do them because they are poor doesn’t the norm 😔
There were two posts between parts so yeah really thkcc
This took me...
They showed up perfectly on my home feed
Scorch thiccer I'm sorry but he just is
I saw the top half on my front page first, then nearly 30 posts down I saw the legs. HELLA THICC
Thicc boi
I had 2 posts between his head and his legs.
I'm happily married, and thus losing viginity, happens fairly early. On the one hand, we had a "plastic bag recycling bin" ....problem was at the time was an actual strategy in top lane.

Then I would high five them for the American palette I suspect.

Replace the orangey bit with pure syrup and put that Hershey's vomit flavoured chocolate on top and flip the unit upside down. The heavy meaty patty squishes it all together for me. Obviously not as good as the other ones removed. I’ve ever even seen a picture of their house. But telling people to hit the brakes
    …..what?
I have an ad between them
Anderson be lookin kinda different ngl
You son of a bitch....
One of the best compliments someone can give me is: “Damn your Titan’s hot”
Double the karma
Oh shit, it actually worked
Nearly worked, was split by an ad tho
You just know Legion is gonna annihilate your booty when the fartcore activates.
Thanks for the thicc boi
Did you just...
I am thicc main
I saw the bottom like five posts down lol
I mean its the right way up, but i wish it wasn’t so i could use the joke thigh high
Big props for both posts
Thi
That's how-
how do you get this to work
Mine would of been perfect but there was an add in between them :(
Probably one of the stupidest things ever but yet the most creative
What?
I was so confused when I saw only this post on hot
I got this in order lol
I have both back to back on my home page😂
Monarch with reinforced has 15000 hp and the 2 ogres only have 12500
Let me guess, this is a titanfall 2 version of "Yo mama is so fat.....I had to put her in 2 post"
&#x200B;

"legion top"  
he can top me  


  


  
now im going to shoot myself
Got both posts in the right order as soon as I opened Reddit. Nice job!
I have the whole Titan because this post is directly above the first.
I got both of them right after each other on my feed and in perfect order
It worked my guy
Finally found the first part of the post.My quest is now complete
Legion can be on top
