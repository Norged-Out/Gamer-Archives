[[What did Fallout 4 do better than previous Fallout games]]


I hear a lot of negative things about the game being said. Like how it's story and characters suck ass or how the factions also suck.

But let's throw that out the window, what has the game at least done better than other Fallout games? 


You can throw a grenade and still have a gun equipped
    Gun play was drastically improved and had some weight to it.
        Yes! It felt so good. I would often sit and just listen to firefights in the distance cus the sound was so good
            I have a mod installed that alters some sounds to be a tad more realistic and the sound of gun fights in the distance is so satisfying to listen to
                I’ve had some of those too what’s the best one you have heard ?
        The next Fallout combat will be incredible. Starfield got a lot of hate for a variety of reasons, but the gunplay and combat is incredibly well done.
    Gun bash too
        This most recent playthrough has made me really appreciate power armored bayonet bashes during ghoul fights. Being able to get one off you then reload is super useful.
            well your name is death corp of krieg so i am not suprised that you find bayonet good.
                Purge the unclean
                    For the emperor of mankind and sigmar and tiber septim
        This!
        Those two things being the same damn button has cost me tens of hours.
    Too much crafting talk, not enough this^
        I mean I loved those too but omg holding the right bumper to through a grenade and have that a separate thing from my main gun?! It was heaven lol
            Meanwhile I’m over here fucking not even using melee because I keep throwing molotovs when I want to punch lol
                lol I do that by accident too
    And sprint
    Yeah, but you can't use vats to throw grenades like you could in 3 and NV, so more a downgrade in my book.
        Yeah but you can still target them so there’s that.
Every piece of scrap you get has a use, which creates an explore loop to upgrade your weapons and armour which is awesome.
    I loved FO4's crafting system. 

Hate Starfield's. Don't get why they messed with perfection.
        Because they tried so hard not to make fallout 4 in space that they ended up making fallout in space, but worse.
            First it was Oblivion with guns, now it’s Fallout in space. Next is Starfield with _____?
                good writing
            Once they release the modding tools I hope we can go back to Fallout in space. 

First Bethesda game where I feel like mods are a requirement to enjoy the game. Put maybe a dozen hours in it and decided it's not worth it in the current state. 

And it's largely because the inventory, crafting, and building are all exactly that. FO4 but worse. I quit when my inventory became too full for my ship and had to try to build my first outpost.
                The modding tools won't change it much.

People mod when they already love a product. It's a force amplifier.

That's why New Vegas is still getting big mods, people adored it.

I've seen a lot of modders openly say they won't be bothered with Starfield, and I'm not surprised.
                    Really depends on what you don’t like about it I guess. The things I didn’t like can absolutely be fixed with mods/ updates. But I also didn’t play very far so it’s possible even fixing those issues I might quit playing. 

I don’t expect it to be this massive thing that rivals Skyrim or New Vegas with years and years of support. I’d settle for it just being less tedious so I can finish a single playthough.
                        The Bad companions, bad worldbuilding, bad lore, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad ending... I mean, unless shipbuilding is your thing to a huge degree, there isn't much redeemable about the game.
                            As I said, depends on what you don't like I guess. For you it sounds like that's "everything" and you're right, mods aren't going to fix all that. 

For me it wasn't terrible just mediocre and I can see updates/ mods making it playable for me. I definitely don't expect that to be the case for everyone.
                                Well yeah, that's what I'm saying, the game was fundamentally bad at most things. Fundamentally, it's boring and uninspired, so modders aren't capable of fixing it.
                    It’s the #16th most modded game of all time and modding tools aren’t even out yet. Can’t wait for you to eat these words when it’s in the top 5
                        I see that as pretty doubtful. Bethesda has a dedicated modding community, people will certainly hop on either way to a degree. Notice the top five are all Bethesda.

But people DO mod games because they enjoy them, and Starfield was... well, shit.

It was probably one of the top 5 biggest disappointments in gaming history, to be honest.
                            *in your opinion

Again, get a fucking grip. You aren’t the arbiter of truth. Art is subjective. I love Starfield. Is my opinion wrong? Fucking no. We both have different opinions. Except I don’t state mine as fact. Downvote me all you want, if you disagree with this you’re either mentally or literally a child.
                                "Art is subjective" is always something people go to when they like shitty art.

You can think New Vegas is a bad video game, for example, or that LOTR: Gollum is the greatest masterpiece in gaming history, but yeah, I'd say you have poor taste in video games. We do have general criteria for art, and for video games, and generally, Starfield fails them.

Bad companions, bad worldbuilding, bad lore, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad ending... I mean, unless shipbuilding is your thing to a huge degree, there isn't much redeemable about the game.
                                    New Vegas is probably my favorite game of all time, yet Starfield is in my top 3 games of 2023, and in my top 5 Bethesda games. 

People can like things and still recognize flaws and room for improvement. Starfield was the first game to fully suck me in since Fallout 4. I did 200+ hours on Xbox, and now I have over 70 hours on PC. 

Why do you think all of the things you listed are bad? In my opinion, the main companions were fine, about on par with Fallout 4's, and reintroducing "lesser" followers like Skyrim had was a great touch. "Bad plot" is pretty broad and vague, considering there are  5 different full storylines. The main quest was good but could've been great if there was more to it than just fetch quests. The ending of the main story was good, too. The quest with the final battle against the Hunter and the Emissary was lots of fun and very unique, and the actual ending with the Unity was satisfying enough.The UC Vanguard was genuinely great and probably the best in the game. SysDef/Crimson Fleet, Ryujin, and the Freestar Rangers were all good, but Ryujin and Freestar Rangers definitely suffered from being too short. The lore is good, typical Bethesda quality, but I do agree that the actual world building was very weak.
                                    I don’t argue with children or manchildren, which you have now well demonstrated yourself to be. Go drink your sippy cup and eat your dino nuggies
                I sometimes feel like the only person who LOVED Starfield. Absolutely has it fair share of problems, and definitely isn’t my favorite BGS game, but it’s hard for me to hate on it too much. I put 150 hours in within a month of it coming out. It was one of those games where when I wasn’t playing it I was thinking about playing it. 

Give me mods that add more variety to POIs and make them closer together, survival mode to give me a reason to build outposts and keep that mechanic from feeling useless, and I think SF could easily climb up in my rankings in a similar way that Fallout 4 did for me once modders got it.
                >First Bethesda game where I feel like mods are a requirement to enjoy the game.

You obviously didn't play 76 at launch. Lol

It's much better now. But it was pretty lame.
                    Alot of us saw the promised and then the timeline= cash grab
                    I've tried at least four times to play 76. I hate it. It feels nothing like Fallout to me. I wish I liked it, but I always go back to FO4 or New Vegas.
                        It's not for everyone. I'm not a die hard player either. I'll usually play for a month or two. Then wait 6 months to a year and then play for another couple months. That way I have new content to play through each time. I eventually get bored with it and go do something else.
                            What kind of new content do they have? I’ve never played games with ‘seasons’ or that are continually updated. I always see a new promo for different content but don’t understand how to access it. The game always seems the same to me.
                                What's new depends on the last time you played I guess. The seasons are just different themed reward tiers that they have where you earn items like armor and atoms(the currency used to buy premium items). So you don't have to pay much attention to them. 

But they have had several large updates outside the seasons. They added a lot of NPCs and several quest lines for factions like the raiders and the brotherhood of steel. There's actually people to interact with now instead of robots. There are a lot more events, that each offer unique rewards, some tied to factions and some not. These are just in game quests and events that you get for playing the game. No need to "access", it's free if you own the game. You may need to look up how to start each quest line as sometimes they're not obvious, but I have to do that for 4 and NV too. 

There's another large update coming in June I think, where they will expand the map for the first time and add more quest lines. 

I'm not trying to talk it up. Like I said it's not for everyone.  But if you haven't been on in a few years I would give it another shot. It's becoming more like fallout, though it still has a lot of the MMO feel to it.
                                    Thanks for the info. I really feel so behind when it comes to this stuff, just got stuck playing RPGs for years and missed out on most of the big MMOs and battle royale games. I hit my late twenties and stopped trying to keep up haha. I’ll probably give it another shot once I get bored with my most recent FO4 play through
                                i think today or yesterday they just added an entire new location and questline. and they add new expeditions and questlines all the time. 

also just various new items to collect from new events and the like
            I would have paid hand over fist for fallout 4 in space
            It's sad, all I wanted was Skyrim / Fallout in space.  Even if we made fun of Bethesda for being predictable, I think it's still what most of us wanted.
            I would have absolutely loved if they just made fallout 4 in space. Shit I'm still playing fallout 4 now, I played Starfield for maybe a month and not really digging it which is a bit sad really.
        I've really come around to FO4s system. The only improvement I think would be to have an actual list of everything you're collecting for that automatically un-sesrches components when you have enough for everything you're trying to build.

Too many times have I known I've needed a bunch of steel so picked up hundreds of it only to realise I need nowhere near that much once I get to the work bench.
        Everything in Starfield, their previous games did better. The only thing Starfield did better was sucking \*ss.
            The environment looks great. 

Too bad I have to make it a blurry mess with FSR to get any decent performance.
            Yeah, Skyrim had great space combat. 

Get a fuckin grip dude. Starfield is fine.
                Bro tried to say Starfield is fine
                You get a grip, "dude." You're "fine".
        I just started starfield today, the crafting is broken
        Man, That's why I'm afraid of fallout 5, TES6, the future of Bethesda makes me sad
        Idk looking high and low for duct tape and desk fans got boring. Starfield decentivized hoarding, I only collected a handful of things for the sciences I specialized in.
        💯 
That’s all I wanted. Well, not all. In fact I wanted a bunch of other things from Starfield too. They all failed. 
    Definitely this. I tried to get into the work benches in 3 or new vegas but 4 was the best expansion to that idea yea
    This right here.  Crafting is like 90% of why I ever replayed Fallout 4 after finishing the story the first time.  Going on specific scavenging runs looking for particular types of junk to break down into what you needed added such a great layer of immersion for me, and I loved it.
        Seriously. Scavenging has been a core part of the Fallout universe but it never really became an important part of the gameplay until 4
    Except anything burnt… and folders. My nemesis.
        But folders had no weight it's like caps but with an exchange rate!
    I encountered someone who said it was bad and broke their immersion because areas get repopulated with scrap and enemies.
    Not really, it just forces me to fill my inventory with the most material efficient junk instead of shit I actually Want.

In New Vegas, I can fill my inventory with all my good shit - in 4 I need to leave a 50+ lb space for junk. Terrible loop.
        Tbf, you force yourself to do that.
    I would contest this, as this shifts away the game design from Fallout and more to Skyrim.

You no longer explore the world through quests and story, but go on a glorified junk hunt. A gameplay loop that is completely out of place in Fallout.
        Scavenging old world ruins for supplies is far more appropriate for Fallout than the Elder Scrolls.
        >go on a glorified junk hunt

No one wants to hear about how you spend your Friday evenings ;)
        I’m currently replaying through 3 and I’m enjoying it so much precisely because I’m not constantly looking for a specific type of junk. Also not a fan of the settlement system. IMO I’ve never been able to get into 76 no matter how many times I go back and give it another try because it just takes the direction 4 went to the extreme and without mods to circumvent the minutia it’s just too tedious for me to enjoying playing it.
            3 is worse if you actually want to craft anything, since you need a specific “recipe” of very particular pieces of junk. I much prefer the 4 style “scrap for raw materials” option. 

The one thing I miss from 3’s mechanics is the ability to repair items with duplicate or same type items, outside of a workbench. So much nicer for looting and keeping your guns shipshape!
        I’d like to argue that it enhances the world of fallout because now it’s even more incentive to explore
            Story and quests should be your incentive, not searching for more junk. It's supposed to be an RPG, not a post nuclear Minecraft.
                What incentive do I have to explore this raider base in a cave? No quest brings me here, no story is here. Why should I even bother?
                    Because story would lead you there? If you want shooting and looting, Fallout is the wrong franchise for you.
                        Story ties into quest, dont be obtuse just because you hate an honestly great improvement.
                            Where's the improvement you speak of? BGS abandoned quality storytelling in favor of cheap exploration for junk. Of you want exploration done right by them look at Morrowind. You didn't need any junk for crafting to encourage exploring.
                                Abondaned quality storytelling? Man, didnt know people didn't like the Institute because they're evil assholes, or the Brotherhood because the Brotherhood is overbearing.

Exploration done right? Look at Fallout 4, I can actually be a scavver, scavving in different locations for specific scrap to build and repair things. Or I can just explore those locations when ***STORIES OR QUESTS*** take me to them.

Cry hard my guy, Bethesda added an extra reason to explore places and you just want to be a Bethesda Bad Bro.
                                    Dude, what the hell are mumbling about? No matter where you look in F4 it's bad quality writing all over the place.

If you want to have games that just lead you around in search of junk for your next crafting project, take your toys and go somewhere else. Right now your line of argumentation is ridiculous. Bethesda did Interplay dirty, then simply outbid Troika for Fallout, and it's been a downhill ride since then - because of people who act like you. Somebody took a precious museum, then turned it into a cheaply made night club. Then drones like you complain that people who liked the museum dare to say that the museum was done better and had far more value. Sorry to break your fantasy, but people don't dislike Bethesda cause "Bethesda Bad", but because they had two interesting franchises and keep dumbing them down to attract as many casuals as possible to milk them dry.
Power armor.

It really made you feel like a walking tank.
    I swear sometimes I hear doom music when I go charging in.
    Gameplay wise Power Armor is LEAGUES better than the other games but I don’t love the lore retcons
        Does it really though?

And don't say fusion core, because PA has always required a "power pack" in the Lore.
            Well I think it’s the invention of the t-60, though idk if the lore ever said t-51 was the last power armor to be made it was still really odd to add it in such a way, I would’ve preferred if the t-60 was invented by the east coast BOS after the defeat of the east coast enclave. I know people were mad that fusion cores lasted so little because the description of power armor in fallout 1 & 2 was that it’s power pack could power it for over 200 years but considering fallout 4 is 210 years after the war it kind of makes sense a lot of fusion cores are running low. The only other lore complaint of power I’ve seen is seeing X-01 power armor in areas that seem to indicate it’s been there since the pre war era which seems to conflict with what people thought of the X-01 because people believed it was made by the enclave post war.
                Yeah agree with you on the T-60 and the X-01.

Although the T-60 is easier to explain. I always saw it as the T-51 was more widespread and considered the best and the T-60 was more newer and developed very close to when the bombs fell, and wasn't really used that much, like it wasn't as widespread as the T-51 until the brotherhood got it and started Mass producing.

The X-01 is harder to explain.

It can be chocked up to gameplay when finding it in the wild.

Although the one in Nuka World, That is impossible to explain
                    > Although the one in Nuka World, That is impossible to explain

Yeah, the Quantum X-01 is a whole can of worms in and of itself.
                    Don't you *dare* say anything bad about my precious Nuka T-51!!!
                        I was referring to the Quantum X-01
                    the x01 is totally explained tho
                        How?

It was an Enclave original armor right?
                            if you want i can copy paste my comment ^^"

yes and no, the advanced power armor is the enclave one it is an upgrade of the x01 (wich is just a prototype)
                                Huh. I didn't know that. 

Do you know what terminal entry this is from?
                                    from loading screen, fallout 76 whitespring enclave terminal and the fallout bible

ill try to put a transcript :

Fallout 4 loading screens: Power Armor was specially engineered and employed by remnants of the U.S. military after the Great War, and offers increased protection over the older, pre-war models

in the fallout Bible :2198 Enclave works on various new technologies, including Power Armor variations. None of these are much of an improvement over the conventional old school Power Armor, and some are actually worse.
2215 Under Presidential Order, Enclave scientists begin to work on an upgraded version of Power Armor. Many prototypes are developed and tested.
2220 October Enclave scientists develop a reliable version of the Mark II Power Armor. The prototype results (and accidents... and explosions... and deaths) are classified by order of the President Richardson for the sake of morale."

the enclave terminal :

if theres more ill update you
                no the x01 isn't the enclave power armor, in terminal, nuka world etc or even about the enclave armor (rn i can't go on the wiki, if you want tomorrow),

the x01 is a prototype power armor.... the enclave taked it and made an upgrade, their own PA the advanced power armor
                    Yeah that’s true but even then why is finding it based on level? You can find this rare prototype armor a bit too easily.
                        that's a gameplay perspective, imagine if you are high level and find a weak t45? so it is not much about lore because it is just for a gameplay
        Outside of Fusion cores the biggest lore retcon is that Power Armor Training is no longer required, but that was itself a lore retcon from Fallout 1 and 2 to fix balancing issues where players would get it too early. Fallout 4 fixed that gameplay problem by making PA require fuel, and as such is able to be more faithful to how PA functioned originally than 3 and New Vegas
    eh, that is both hit and miss. the battery in these things is supposed to last centuries, not minutes.
        For the battery, I just chalk it up to gameplay
        It would basically be meaningless to have Fusion Cores in the game if each one lasted for centuries. You’d find one Core and never need any more for pretty much the rest of the game. 
Having them last for a couple minutes is just for game balance. 
            Leakage and sitting in an idling power generator for 210 years will cause issues with power retention.

I also see the Fusion Cores post war like the MK.1 chest Arc Reactor from Iron Man:-

Yinsen - "That could run your heart for fifty lifetimes!"

Tony - "Yeah... or something big for fifteen minutes."

Compared to lighting a building the size of the Concord museum in game, it doesn't really compare.
    My only gripe with it is the running animation is a bit goofy.
    Fallout 1 and 2 had this tho
        I actually felt like it was more impactful in the originals because it was a pretty massive power spike. Considering the difficulty of those games it felt like a massive achievement to earn PA. 

For Fallout 4 I never really felt like I needed power armor for anything since the world scales to your level pretty aggressively and the fusion cores made me just not use it even for fun. You also get it way too early as well so it doesn't feel earned imo.
        Its better, because it's in the "3d" real
            Better is highly subjective though. I could make an argument that Classic is better as no fusion cores are needed to use the armor
                I kind of agree with you, I think they handing you the power armor 20 minutes in the game   lead to them adding fusion cores and the, in my opinion, stupid armor condition (seriously, why these things even have durability while your everyday armor doesn't?) as balance reasons.

Since in the classic games it was an end game loot, these workarounds weren't necessary, so that's a good point.

However, for me, both the classics and 4 makes you feel very powerful in the power armor, but 4 has an advantage to feel better exactly because of the "3D feel" that was nonexistent in 3 an NV.
                    True, but my point is that this gameplay element was already in the series, and a bit better as no condition to repair or use cores but they’re extremely limited
                        Right, I was focusing in the 3D aspect because 3 and NV messed this already existing element by making the power armor just be another piece of armor, while 4 took advantage of the gameplay mechanics.
                How is that better? Fusion cores provide a necessary balance and make it more realistic.
                    How? I don’t mind Fusion Cores but they shouldn’t be 10-20 mins of use then need more. Technically it’s a retcon as the suits are supposed to last over a hundred years. 

Fallout 4 could be excused as it takes place 210 years after the War, but 76 confirms it as they have FCs and break down but not as quickly as in 4.
Graphics, sound, gunplay, location design - all the technical areas are huge improvements.
    I'm sure it already exists as a mod but 3 and NV with all of 4's graphics, sound, etc would kick ass
        NV with 4’s graphics and crafting would be BALLIN
L
            There's currently a mod in the works that converts FO4 into base new vegas, not sure if its going to be keeping the crafting system but the gunplay and graphics will be in the new engine
                Heck, even just having new Vegas with player home customization would be nice.
                That’s never coming out
                    Let me dream
        The ideal remake would be New Vegas with F4 Graphics and (some) of the content we missed on due to the cuts. Post-game stuff, more legion territory/a new legion companyon, some more options for the independent ending. Hell, if they want to get real crazy they could even add a fifth dlc. Could be cool
            "Could be cool" buddy I'd pay good money for that
        This shit. Right here. Put it in an iv drip into my veins. *droooools*
        i'm not gonna lie i love the shitty graphics of 3 and nv. it's just what fallout looks like to me
        There’s 2 seperate mod teams trying to upgrade Fallout 3 and NV entirely into Fallout 4s engine. I’m sure there’s plenty of mods for those games to make them more like 4 already though
        I’m weird in that i’d like some of the gameplay mechanics in Fallout 4 (like crafting and upgrades) but would prefer the movement and gunplay of Fallout NV and 3 lol
            Lack of sprint suuuuuuuuucks. Really need something between “instant fast travel” and “painfully slow jog”.
                I really just like the clunkiness of it. but if it had more features, i’d be all for it, like sprinting or grenade hotkey.
    Getting in firefights in 4 is just so funnnnn
    I don't really like how FO4 looks. Everything looks like plastic
        I feel like it technically looks better but sone things suffer. A lot of enemies do look more cartoonish like ghouls and deathclaws. Like graphically they are better, but I prefer the look of them in 3 and NV
        I think that the more stylised (or cartoony/plastic) graphics really do help with longevity. Fallout 4 is nine years old at this point but the graphics hold up much better than the more gritty and realistic graphics of the previous two games did at a similar point after their release. Worth thinking about for a game that doesn’t have a yearly release cycle.
    I disagree with location design, but that’s it.
    I play last couple weeks Fallout NV with TTW and a mod list. Went now to Fallout 4. Somehow grafics feel..comics like. Too bright, too shiny,  too happy

Then againyou have settlementand Sim settlement so  yeah .
    New Vegas algae better Gunplay, gun design and Gun audio.
        Love new Vegas, but the gunplay is probably the worst part.
Companions and everything about companions, particularly that their existence and their ability to give feedback on player behaviour replaced the karma system with something a lot more appropriate to life in a post-apocalyptic hellscape. Lots of absorbing things to do, map is phenomenally detailed and full of interesting characters, places, dioramas etc. The existence of so many side quests meant that you could choose the sort of character you wanted to play. Power Armour finally living up to the original dream. A revamped and accessible perk system instead of the opaque "lists of things" from the prior games (NB I have my complaints about what they did and they need to distinguish between perks and stats more, but it was still a step in the right direction). Obviously there were lots of things to do with graphics and physics that were vastly improved, as you'd expect from a more advanced game. So much stuff to do. Settlements was an amazing addition. Survival mode effectively a different (and arguably much better) game.
    New Vegas is the best at that aspect
        On the contrary. New Vegas is notoriously poor at that aspect. All the other games laugh at New Vegas behind it's back about that aspect.
Honestly design of creatures for example the ghouls look like people who have suffered years of radiation instead of burnt zombies. More things look more realistic as well like death claws, robots and bugs
    I looooove the enemies in 4 and how each got a different gimmick and weak spots. Crippling the legs of a feral ghoul will make it explode, causing them to fall on the ground and make effectively incapacitated. Deathclaws have their weak spot on their bellies and their movements try to hide them. Crippling the arms of a Protectron will cause to go on self destruct mode. Taking on someone in power armor? Shoot at the Power Core to pop them out of their shell. Dealing with a Mirelurk queen? Shoot at the glands to take the poison and larvae out of the equation.

Having a VATS build in FO4 is one of my favorite experiences with the franchise
        Severing a Deathclaw's tail will also make them extremely unbalanced, if I remember right.
    I wasn't a fan of 4 for a lot of reasons, but 4 did Feral Ghouls better than any other game. The way they keep coming at you no matter what feels good.
        One time I shot off a feral ghouls head and it still kept coming at me, the only thing left of its face was it’s jaw but it still kept coming
    Deathclaw design was one of the first things I thought of

4 is the only one I’ve played; watching videos of previous games is a bit jarring
        They look kinda goofy in F:NV
            They acted extremely goofy too. 

I remember attempting to cheese the game by shooting at them and then trying to go into the farm settlement near the deathclaw quarry in new Vegas. One of them ran, Usain Bolt style sprinted and opened the door as I entered just to attack me inside.
    Yeah, I know others like them, but imo a lot of the old designs were more goofy than intimidating
    I prefer the look of F3/NV Ghouls when not feral, but I have to admit once I realized they were covered in tumors I started liking (at least for the ferals) F4’s design a lot more.
    I actually prefer the design in 3 and new vegas a lot more, they seem so much scarier. Especially non feral ghouls, I can really see why people would hate them for no reason seeing their flesh rotted and crispy and sloughing off. In 4 they seem too smooth and weirdly have full heads of hair when they have it
Power armor, combat, urban exploration. Loved the verticality of Boston, Power Armor feels like its a special thing, and the combat is just much easier to flow with than just being rigid in previous titles.

Companions are debatable but I enjoyed the relational aspect, having likes/dislikes. I don't think every companion was the best companions ever, but the mechanics were interesting.
1) Gunplay, reload animations, and customization

2) Giving every piece of miscellaneous scrap a purpose, forcing you to scavenge like an actual survivor in the post-apocalypse would, as well as giving value to Bethesda’s famous use of miscellaneous objects to make the world feel more interactive and lived-in.

3) Power armor. It actually feels like a bridge between infantry and armored vehicles, which is what it’s supposed to be. It actually looks protective and like it would enhance your strength. Fallout 3 and New Vegas power armor especially looked shit, like a spandex suit with heavy metal plates glued on. I also liked that your character was former military, so you didn’t need power armor training to use it since you already had it.

4) Supermutant design. No more goofy as shit leather straps in their mouths. That design always baffled me, it made them look silly, not intimidating. Now they actually look like mutated humans.

5) General art style. Things have a much more retrofuturistic look to them. It really screams 40’s and 50’s now in a way it never quite did before. Buildings even adopt that design instead of everything being generic office buildings that could exist today.

BONUS: I know not everyone is into settlement building, and it didn’t exist in previous games so hard to say it did it “better”, but settlements are an amazing feature I hope they keep going forward as an **optional** thing for players like me who enjoy it. I put 700 hours into this game because of settlements.
    If they gave us a game with all these qualities, the loot diversity of NV with GRA installed, hand loading benches, and the karma system from NV, we’d have a perfect Fallout game.

I also wish they’d implement more of a trade economy for “luxury junk” items like old world cigarettes, coffee, jewelry, cleaning supplies, tools, clothes, and children’s toys.

Then they could make it so that each type of item has a demand for certain traders of the wasteland, like one pays you more for cartons of cigarettes because it’s in demand in their area.

Realistically I imagine items such as these will become heavily desired commodities that would fetch a high price.

(I literally make all my money in FO3/NV from scavenging fission batteries and other high-value junk so it would be kinda fun to have to learn where you can sell certain items for higher profit)
        I completely agree. I always found it odd that there was no real use for useful stuff like that other than scrapping it for parts. Abraxo Cleaner would come in handy, but all you can do is scrap it for… fiberglass? And cigarettes should he more valuable than just asbestos and cloth
            Exactly. I’d imagine things like that would be in high demand for more advanced settlements that have ascended Maslow’s Hierarchy, or traders who specialize in luxury goods. Can’t picture every trader in the wasteland selling nothing but guns, ammo, armor, and meds
                At the very least give us a Shady Sam style trader from Oblivion who sells smuggled, even illegal goods, and let us do supply runs for him.
        >I also wish they’d implement more of a trade economy for “luxury junk” items like old world cigarettes, coffee, jewelry, cleaning supplies, tools, clothes, and children’s toys.

This mod does exactly that. And more.

[PLUNDER](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/19377)
            PC went down about a year back unfortunately. I’m hoping Bethesda pulls their head out of the sand and actually implements these things themselves with the next release.

Vanilla runs on FNV can be pretty fun once you get past the general jankiness.

But once I replace my PC, I’ll check it out!
    I liked the leather straps, I always thought they were needed to literally hold open their fucked up, mutated mouth so they could properly communicate.
    >I put 700 hours into this game because of settlements.

I'm exactly the same, although a lot of credit can go to Kinggath and his team for their incredible Sim Settlements mod
    > Supermutant design. No more goofy as shit leather straps in their mouths.

They look like vaguely humanoid pieces of green plastic wrapped in a trash bag. There was a lot of casualties that came along with the cartoonification of the art style but supers got absolutely fucked in the transition.
        “Cartoonification”? There’s nothing cartoony about it. 

And that’s a laughable take, given how supermutants looked before. The new one looks closer to a mutated human than the old design
            The new ones look goofy as hell my man, that's all there is to it. They changed an iconic and unique design into an 8 foot tall green plastic mannequin, removed any personality and style, and wrapped them in garbage bags for clothes. 

Seriously, that's what you prefer?
                Yes, because I disagree with your assessment entirely.

The old version looked like ‘roided up bodybuilders had a baby with spongebob to make them yellow, and then dressed them up in leather BDSM shit. I’ll take “trashbags” over BDSM bullshit any day. And what do you expect supermutants to wear? Designer fashion? They cant wear regular human clothes cuz they’re too big, and they’re not smart enough to make anything nice, so they throw together what they can. You know, like most people in the wasteland already do? Did you forget this is a post-apocalyptic game?

And you can’t seriously tell me the old ones didn’t look goofy with those leather straps over their face holding up their upper lip. That’s such a dumb looking design that makes no sense
                    We're just gonna have to agree to disagree on this one buddy. The fo4 mutants are irredeemable.
                        Only thing irredeemable is your taste in art style
                            Cry about it I guess Bethesda boy.
                                I love when kids resort to the “cry about it” response. It’s always entertainingly vapid and says a lot about your lack of an actual argument.
The looting menu and system in general. Pretty much every fallout and Elderscrollls has a mod to implement that quick looting system now.
The shooting gameplay is easily the best in the series. To the point where I preferred it to using VATS
Lore accurate power armor aside from fusion cores which I don’t think were ever mentioned they really nailed the “walking tank” look
    Fusion cores are my only gripe with the power armor design in 4. The excessive power consumption combined with "uwu oh no u shot my exposed powah cowe with a fuckin small calibur pipe peestol imma explode how embawassin" is just absurd to me. Everything else they did with it was absolutely brilliant.
        now i want a pink power armor with an "uwu" written on the torso, it would be the best bos paladin
I would love to see the power armor mechanic in the other fallout (but you still need to learn to use it)
    While I dearly love 4 (it's tied for my favourite with 3), the PA useage thing is something that always got me.

I can understand Nate being able to use PA immediately, he's former military and IIRC served in a unit that used it. So why does Nora know how to use PA straight away? Did Nate bring a suit home to teach her with?

I feel like an opportunity was lost to make the two leads distinctly different characters with the deathclaw encounter. Nora was a lawyer prior to the war, why isn't she able to whip the raiders into a temporary alliance with the MM to fight it? That would be a hell of a spectacle, and shows she is badass in her own way.

As for Nora using PA, why not slightly rework Sturges? Make him a former BoS member under Brandis' team who left to join the MM. The fact that >!he's a synth!< never gets brought up anyway, quietly drop that aspect so he fits, then he can teach Nora after the deathclaw fight.

Dunno, just something that's always irked me. I can get that Nate would teach Nora how to handle guns properly, hell she could have grown up in a household where someone used to take her hunting. But a civvie using PA never sat quite right with me. That's also the same problem I have with the characters from FO76 using PA as well, although I get that that game isn't canon so it doesn't matter as much.

Rant over.
        Honestly, having basic power armor training as standard for all branches of civil service would at least be interesting from a lore perspective, even a PA frame with some kevlar stretched over it would be a decent policing tool.
This is a weird one, but I think the pacing of the main plot is a bit better. NV had an awkward jump between Benny and instantly going to the faction warfare, but 4 spaces that out a bit with the teleporter part of the plot.
    I agree with NV it's definitely a flip in gameplay after you get the platinum chip, but if you play in the "intended" way it works a bit better. Helping the people in Goodsprings fight off the Powder Gangers, rescuing the deputy from bandits in Primm, meeting the Legion in Nipton, helping the ghouls with their rocket near Novac, then dealing with the hostage situation in Boulder City. 

With that route you see the effect the Courier has on the various groups in the Mojave. You are already working the shift the balances of power based on who you help.
        Ngl i kinda wish the powder gangers had some more time. I get they are introductory villains but, idk, coulda been cool
            There is a lot more to them, but you have to seek it out. You can do some quests with the ones at the prison to get some resources they need, and protect their base against the NCR. The Vault 19 Power Gangers have a questline where they can join the Great Khans
                Wow I never knew this! I’m a big fan of the khans so being able to add to their power base is very intriguing

I’ve usually just eliminated the powder gang in my runs
        True, It took a while for me to even step a foot on the strip
        To a degree, but it’s still a very very sudden flip with no downtime (the parts before this are all about the revenge and what you have to do to get the information you need). It works a little better if Benny escapes, but not by much.
            The Benny “revenge” plot isn’t even a plot- it’s a frame to introduce you to 90% of the relevant factions and companions. You can skip it all and b-line straight to Benny. 

The factions plot line is the Real plot.
    I'd say this is because in Fallout New Vegas you can't really separate the story and the setting.

They are one and the same. Fallout 3 and 4 have more traditional stories that are more separate from the open world.

That's why it feels so different in comparison. I think you only find it awkward if you go into it expecting a more traditionally designed game.
    "sorry, can't progress the story until you safe this settlement" yeah, no, the pacing was ass.
        4 never made you do anything with the settlements beyond the teleporter mission.
Dogmeat
Sprinting
The art style, in my opinion, is leauges better than 3 and NV. Everything feels retrofuturistic, rather than vaugely nuclear powered 50s.
    I think that ambiguity of what the world looked like in old Fallouts, especially in 1 and 2 kind of gave the world a cool mysterious feel. Made you really wonder what the Old World was and how it is really old since you don’t even know 100% how it looked like.
        The gothic architecture in some buildings of the classic fallouts always intrigued me, there were some really weird doors in these games.

It surely made me wonder the cultural reasons for a society with such advanced technology to have them.
Combat.
Weapon  mods
In my opinion, literally everything but the story. The main quest is the only think that keeps FO4 from being a 10/10
    Agreed. I wish Bethesda would understand this. With 76 and starfield though, I’m worried Bethesda is going to stay on its trend of basic stories and with little to no depth to them. Even though Skyrim is pretty basic at least it’s stories and characters are memorable and cool.
        For me it’s more that you are completely railroaded on the main quest. There are hardly any role playing decisions to make until you get to the Institute
            For sure. I remember in Fallout 3 how you could skip so much of the first half of the game by going straight to Tranquility lanes or how many ways there was to get information from the Irish guy to find your dad.
    Damn, even the dialogue wheel?
        It’s different but I have a hard time saying it’s better or worse. It make’s dialogue much quicker and cinematic like mass effect but you also do lose out on some context that you’d have in previous games.
Gunplay for sure. 
The entire shooty, looty, crafty, buildy gameplay loop is just superb. 

There is no hard cap to special. you can use clothes and chems to get any aspect as high as you want.

Survival mode was also way improved and the best way to play the game imo.
ADS
By vastly improving upon the gunplay, crafting and gameplay - **Fallout 4 has the best and most addictive gameplay loop Bethesda has ever crafted**

Explore > Combat > Loot > Upgrade > Repeat
Crafting: FNV can rival, but it is not as good as F4 with 99% of the scrap being useful in some way. While the number of items, that you can craft in vanilla is not as large, but the equipment upgrade is a LOT larger, and better.

Rebuilding: well in previous games there was no real rebuilding at all. In F4 you can actually change a lot of settlements, and turn them into small towns, or farms, or just base to use for yourself. I bet, that some people spend more time building stuff, than playing any other part of the game.

Combat: by a large margin combat is much better, than any other games. In F3 vanilla combat felt like a chore, and a giant mess of clicking. Even with self made mod, that increase damage done, and taken by 900% the game is still not onehitkill. In F4 even without mods is acceptable.

Leveling: this one is clearly subjective, and many will disagree. But hear it out. The leveling system itself i think is better for 2 reasons. First there is no joker stat. In F1, and F2 going 10 agility was just superior no matter what character you played. In F3, and FNV going 10 intellect is simply superior. Inf F4 i can't tell any stat, that is superior regardless of build. The part, that indeed fell off is the actual usage of the skills. With the exception of charisma barely any perks are used during quests. And it is not, that they are impossible to do. On the last Voyage quest you can use jury rigging to bypass some repair stuff. In Nuka World you can use roboticist perk to bypass some tasks on the wild west area. These things should be part of almost every quest.

Vertibirds: Another thing, that was not really a thing in previous games. Sure they were there as static objects, or sometimes part of scenes, but you could not ride them wherever you want, or shoot from them, or shoot them down. It shows, that vehicles can be clearly introduced, and used with the game, and maybe later we get more options to use.

Power armor: now by default i don't like how easily it breaks. But with a bit modding reducing damage taken to the power armor's health by 90% it is a great thing. But even without the mod this power armor is what truly feels like using power armor. A walking tank, that can take enormous damage, and has a lot of extra utility to it. Like jetpack, auto-stimpak, target scanner, increased strength, speed, immunity to fall damage, and even can be used as a weapon itself. It feels like a top tier military equipment, that can turn the tide of wars instead of slightly better, than a normal combat armor.
    > In F3, and FNV going 10 intellect is simply superior.

Lmao what?
        In both of those games skills are super good to have. Repair, and weapon skill means direct damage, repair, merchantile for money, speech good for many quests, medicine for surviving stuff, etc.. Intellect grants skillpoints each level, and unlike endurance there is no retroactive spending. If you start the game below 10 intellect, then upon first level up you lose that skillpoint. Permanently.
Fo4 crafting and weapon upgrade system was great

And the simplification of stats is something I liked , not to be confused with rpg options
Gunplay was definitely the most noticeable. Didn't have to rely on V.A.T.S. so much... which eventually prepped for its absence in Fallout 76. 

Power Armor being more of a vehicle than clothing was a great improvement, in my opinion. I think there should have still been some sort of PA training, but I understand why they chose to give it to us in the very beginning of the game as opposed to other games. The power core limitation was smart and effective in dampening the use of PA in the beginning, but ultimately letting you know its power against certain enemies. I think it was a good choice.
The junk/scrap system makes all those random items around abandoned buildings useful. It expanded on the weapon mods system a lot which I like. The new version of Power Armor is cool as hell. I think it did DLCs and companions a lot better than Fallout 3.
I mean literally everything except the quality of writing and story. It’s a damn fun game if you ignore the main quest
**Ambiance** \- I don't think it's talked about enough just how good the Fallout games overall are at creating great ambiances. This ambiance is built by the world design and the skeletons of skyscrapers and boats and cars. The sound design is yet another way they build ambiance effectively. It's very evident in FO4 with details such as the creaking of steel when walking through central Boston. Even such things as enemy design and placement (feral ghouls, most enemies in Far Harbor) helps to build a tremendous tense ambiance. Frankly, FO4 does not get enough recognition just how well it builds ambiance with all levels of design!
    I disagree, to me new vegas handles ambience better, 
The only tension from far harbor is missing a gulper in a tree.
        To me, gulpers is just one of many part of the tension created on The Island. The fog and the constant rads adds a sense of limited time when exploring. Most new enemies are hidden; gulpers in tree, hermit crabs in abandoned cars, fog crawlers within the fog or standing still among trees, anglers by the water. On top of that it's the grand soundscape that builds the ambiance with background music but also has a lot of layered sounds that evokes a sense of not being alone. And on top of that you have stuff like Mother Fog and the visual design of the Nucleus.

I didn't even find those experiences limited to Far Harbor, but had them all over FO4. The Swan really got my heart pumping. Seeing the Deathclaw in between the planks of the museum was among the best gaming moments that year. The car tunnel filled with feral ghouls. Being able to run into sleeping Deathclaws in the Glowing Sea. Finding suits of Power Armour underwater.

That said, I don't think NV is horrible at creating ambiance, it's just worse in my mind compared to FO3 and FO4. Partially because some of the intended ambiance in NV felt incongruous to the story and the setting and just broke my immersion instead of enhancing it. In FO:NV I prefer having the radio on, while in FO4 I rarely listen to the radio cause the standard stuff is so good.
            Honestly the only ambience in 4 that is good is the children of atom theme in far harbor. Compared to [this]( https://youtu.be/YnVynk4hllU?feature=shared) fallout 4’s overall ambience is too little in terms of dread and too much in heroism.
Not really in any particular order:


1. Scrap, Crafting, and Weapon Modularity
2. Settlement Building/Homes
3. Power Armor
4. Companions
5. Visuals
6. Combat
7. The Map
8. Cinematic
9. Enemy Variety
10. Armor and Apparel
    >1. Scrap, Crafting, and Weapon Modularity

>6. Combat

>2. Settlement Building/Homes

These are the big three for me, in that order, though power armor is an honorable mention.
Inventory management and being able to build a linked stash at any settlement
The combat was better than the earlier Bethesda entries, ghouls crawling in through windows or out from underneath things as you enter a room added a nice horror element to some places.

The power armour feels more like armour, you get a pretty satisfying feeling of weight and size as you stomp about.
I like the companion system a lot. Characters might not be better than previous games but they feel more “alive” in 4 if that makes sense. It’s probably because of how cinematic everything is and having a voiced protagonist helps, even though I don’t think it’s the right move. Having the Bethesda zoom on characters makes them feel kinda dull, it’s hard to explain. But I just like how interacting with the characters works in 4.
Gunplay
Companion interactions.   


Fallout 3 companions 1000% were full of missed opportunities by not saying a lot,   
New Vegas was better but it would have been nice to hear them talk more,  
 4 was perfect in my eyes.  


 Allowing your companion to be a second voice, to back you up when you spoke, or go against you if you did something they didn't like was really really cool and made them feel so much more like a companion and not just another gun or person to hold your stuff.   


I hear some say they talked too much, but going from 4 being my first to New Vegas and then to 3, the road feels so much more boring when they get more and more idle in my opinion.
Weapon customization.  Yeah it's a bummer that there aren't very many actual unique weapons but the weapon customization was really cool with how I could take a basic bitch 10mm that I get at the start and keep improving it so that it's still good late game.

I like the settlement building, I'm someone who can get into Minecraft or games like it for hours a day every week for several months so this was something I really got into and got into it even more when all the DLC's had been released and had made a factory pumping out 5.56, .308, .45, .44 by the hundreds because by that point I had been playing the game for several hours a day since launch and had amassed a stockpile of resources to make more ammo than I could ever need.  One small complaint is that they did not make it so that if you had Nuka World you could craft handmade rifles or 7.62 ammo.  I also built a sort of shop area with displays on the wall of different weapons with different modifications and had a settler assigned to a weapons shop etc.

But while I do like the settlement building, I think they pushed it way too hard, I think that instead of having a bunch of settlements of varying sizes dotted around the map they should have made about five large sized settlements.

Power armor.  Power armor in 3 and New Vegas just feels like regular clothes you just put on, personally I didn't really feel all too powerful or unstoppable wearing it and I really liked how 4 made power armor feel like a walking tank/mech suit, that's what I picture when I think of a big suit of armor made for modern combat.

Having a dedicated grenade button is a huge improvement as I don't need to swap between my gun and a grenade to throw it anymore.

The gameplay just feels good, especially the gunplay and melee combat, I never once used melee weapons in Fallout outside of the mole rat stick in 3 until I found how much fun using a super sledge was in 4.
- The gunplay definetely improves from the previous FO3 and New  Vegas. It is more fluid and considerably easier to hit a moving target without VATS. Weapon customization is better too, I guess, because the previous games had almost none, or just bare minimum like in NV. Sadly it's plagued with balance issue and (in my opinion) worse gun design when compared to older title.  

- I like the new Power Armor mechanic. They make it like a mini mech with separate power cell and modular armor, allowing you mix and match between different armor sets. And it moves just like a heavy-weight mech, adding some sort of immersion to the game. The only downside I see is lore-related, as in the previous games Power Armor are treated similar to regular armor and you need specific skills to wear it.
SPRINTING!!!!!
As much hate as Fallout 4 gets, it's much more approachable to new time players. The older games can be great, but between just being a older game with outdated mechanics and the occasional issues even getting the games to work, it can turn away new fans. 

Fallout 4, even though it's going on 9 years old, still feels like a more modern game. Sprinting, better crafting system, better gunplay, power armor feels like power armor, better companion system and even though some fans might dislike the story, having a basic, understandable story is better for the casual player. The game does have its own issues with bugs and glitches, but outside of issues with mods I've downloaded, these issues rarely cause major issues with the game.
The settlement system is very cool and with only a few mods it can be really addicting. It also gives junk items a good use. For example in New Vegas why would you ever pick up a steam gauge assembly? It was heavy and not particularly valuable to merchants. 

The beginning of the game has great atmosphere and the setting is nice in general. I like mixing colonial vibes with noire vibes, and the mystery of exactly who or what the Institute and Railroad are is great. The game should have held onto that feeling of mystery for longer, I think, but we're saying good things about Fallout 4. 

Let's see here. Another thing I think they did better was the gunplay. Guns feel more solid and impactful. 

That's a good segue into the sound design, which I think is the best in the series. Gunshots and explosions have a lot of bass and sound very "meaty."
The scrap system, power armor, combat, and base building.
* gunplay, graphics, leveling, map design, survival mode etc.
* power armor and a revamped armor system
* added settlement building, revamped crafting, a purpose for 'junk'
* gave 'luck' a much-needed buff
* improved vats system
The gunplay is genuinely entertaining, the variety of skill progression is more open, the scrap mechanic actively rewards exploration, the scale of gun modification allows for all manner of smell at, the different enemy types keep the game fun into the late game.

It’s not as deep as New Vegas or as atmospheric as 3, but 4 is the most fun I’ve had with a Fallout game
Looting, crafting, scrapping, combat especially, companions, graphics (duh), sound, character customisation, power armor.
Crafting, Power Armor frames, general UI, equipped grenades, and (imo) homesteading in general.
The environmental storytelling. Getting to play detective with skeletons, junk placement, and rubble debris is a blast. It makes Fallout 4 feel like it’s in touch with the pre-war world more than I’ve felt in other Fallout games. Taking your time to just look around feels rewarding beyond “I found this loot” or “I continued this quest.”
Power armor, I can hardly play 3 and New Vegas anymore just cause of how shite the power armour there is in comparison.
    If you have the ability to mod titans of the new west improves power armour for new vegas.
Gameplay is more fluid, and by that I mean the fights are damn good. Scraps are useful. The wasteland have a lot of events everywhere so you don't walk 20min to be entertained. Crafting system exist !  Settlement building is a lot of fun (if you like this kind of "make your base" game). You can change piece of your power armor and upgrade it.
Gunplay.

Best feeling ranged combat in the series.

Settlements

I adore settlement building. I like wathing my little Minutemen republic grow into a force to be reckoned with.
Running. Honestly, it improved the game so much. No idea why the first games never allowed you to run or have any form of transport.
The crafting system got a pretty good overhaul, but I wish they spent more time to take the customization further than what we got. I liked the idea of gathering junk to upgrade weapons. 

Gunplay has been really good compared to previous games, some of the firefights I've been in have been epic. 

Power Armor overhaul is A+, love roaming around in those especially the X-01.
Graphics. Combat. Some aspects of weapon & armor modification. Settlement building. The quick d-pad menu (not sure if this was in previous ones). At least felt like quicker/less loading screens. Being able to just jump off the Prydwen was great.
Building. And like the other guys said, every piece of junk is useful.
I thought the building system was very fun, although it has... a few flaws. Also, I think that the combat was an improvement over the other games as well
Power armor!!
The gunplay and combat in general is miles better
Power Armor for sure, I'm doing a PA only playthrough right now and I'm surprised how much dialogue there is to you wearing it from enemies and npcs alike, and man if I don't feel invincible.
The use of vertical space in maps is great.  The warzone feel in the downtown area with BoS and super mutants fighting is pretty interesting, not perfect but good.  The overall feel of F4's power armor is better than 3/NV, it just needs the DT from 1&2 and it'd be perfect. The Atom Cats and the robot race track do a good job of using leisure activity as a civilization marker.
    Never really noticed how big of a step up the verticality was until you mentioned it. I don't think Bethesda really had verticality like that in any of their previous games.
        Not at the same level.  There's a few good locations like Vivec city or the area outside Alftand, but they don't use the space as well as downtown F4.
I just picked up FO4 for the first time since release, and I might get some hate for this, but the game has aged extremely well. 

I hated it on release. I thought it was such a massive step down from 3 and NV, but now, if I want to play a Fallout game, I actually prefer picking it up over 3 and NV. 

I still don't think it's as good as they were, but they aren't quite as easy to just pick up and start playing again.
Weapon customization, gunplay, sprint mechanic, building, crafting
While I still have some qualms about ease of access and lack of PA training. I genuinely think FO4 depiction of Power Armour is the best one. Also ignoring the power cores. 


It actually feels like a walking tank.


I just wish it was harder to obtain, and mod with advanced stuff considering PA was state of the art
4 is bigger/crafting/modding/base build which no other fallout had….all of that made it better for me.
Gunplay, the ability to have a grenade AND a gun or melee simultaneously, power armor.
Weapon customization was way better, power armor system was far more robust and developed. Better mods than the last iterations also. This game also has a visually much more pleasing environment than 3 or NV, although NV is close and probably more interesting.
Looting was perfected in FO4. Never having to enter another menu to loot, highlighting the scrap you need, bring able to stash all your scrap with one button press. Gloriously streamlined.
Power armor
Survival. Hardcore mode in New Vegas makes use of the food items decent enough and the Survival skill is actually quite useful. However, the survival mode in 4 adds an entire new layer and difficulty to the game that’s unrivaled. Making every trip from your base a dangerous journey that could set you back significantly makes the game so much more interesting to play. Add an alternate start mod and play the game more like a sandbox and you’ll have one of the greatest survival experiences in recent memory.
Sprinting alone is why I don't go back to NV. GOTTA GO FAST but like, seriously. I like normal jogging most of the time, but I hear bullets fly I wanna RUN. First Person animations are pretty decent, I enjoy them.
Sprinting, gunplay, graphics are the big 3.
Power Armour, gunplay (with some exceptions) throw-able weapony, and usable junk. Those are the big ones
To be honest, world building.
The nuka raider dlc is the best dlc in the franchise.
Enemies are so much better. Ghouls, Deathclaws, Yao Guai, Gulpers, all of the enemies have such different behavior. Gulpers use camouflage, Deathclaws run at you on all fours to protect their bellies, ghouls get their limbs torn off. Makes the game a lot more fun.
Skill progression. Tying character stats solely to the Perks and SPECIAL stats makes build refinement much less onerous, and opens up a lot of good perks that in other games would've been locked behind high requirements. 

For instance, the first few hours of every playthrough of mine involves maxing out my Perception and Intelligence stats so that those early bobbleheads get them to 11 and 12, respectively (including using the "You're SPECIAL" book on INT while dehydrated; 11 INT from Day 1, leveling up becomes wicked fast).
Crafting system. Despite my love for New Vegas, remembering which items can be used to make scrap metal so that you can then make something out of it is a pain. What do you need for a doctor's bag? Which skins are needed for which belt or armor? Do I need Agave fruit for a super stimulant or not? Pain. In the F4, you can bring all the junk (literally junk) to the settlement in a rather nice manner and craft something in a variety of ways. It's not perfect, but very good. If they leave this in the future, they will make it more diverse: not “one option is better than another,” but “several equally good options to choose from, so that everyone chooses their own to suit their playing style.”

And building your own base. it did not improve, but appeared at all.
The exploring and the flights 
edit: fights
I love the crafting system upgrade and the amount of customization for weapons.
Power armor, aside from fusion cores they get it perfectly like it was in fo1 and 2.
-Did away with weapons and armor breaking 

-Equip gun and grenade at the same time 

-Power armor feels genuinely impactful and not just like slightly better armor

-Weapon and armor modifications gives you an excuse to keep using weapons that you get early on instead of having them feel underpowered
Most of it is technical. Slow time in VATS. Companion interactions during dialog choices. Camera angles in dialog. 


Even tho most hated the voiced MC having them adlib while drunk and skipping dialog was pretty funny. 


The overall designs of everything to a more colorful 50s style, despite the distressed looks of everything.


Settlement system was far more fun than I expected. Still wish for a durability meter on weapons. 
Combat, crafting, and, unpopular opinion, art style. I also like the power armor the best.
Crafting and modding

Between it and 76 there is so much customization you’d think you’re in heaven
I love the ambient sound/music in 4 the best
the actual controlling and feeling of the character  and weapons is definitely an objective improvement over 3/NV
The exploration - combat - looting - upgrading - repeat cycle is amazing
Fallout 4 is Incredible. I'm replaying it now. Level 34 😎
Gunplay is miles better than the older ones. I also liked the switch to Power armor, making it FEEL like a walking tank. Also giving purpose to junk you pick up to build and craft is genuinely a genius idea
gunsmith, even if their guns are god awful, along with the settlement feature, its lovely to make your settlement look like the fucking enclave
Combat, graphics, performance and animations
For me its the same as why skyrim is so popular. Fallout 4 more so then the others has the most freedom to do whatever
4's settlement build, crafting, combat and less focus on rpg elements is probs why it appeals to a larger audience
The power armor is absolutely fantastic
Quite a bit. It has more concurrent players 10 years later than all other fallout games combined right now. People dont do that unless they enjoy the game.

Not that anyone on this sub will admit it.
More choices than 3 and ability to pick factions like NV.(That already makes it better than 3.
The building mechanics are far better than previous installments.
Power Armors and Charisma SPECIAL usefulness outside talking.

And talkative companions.

Deathclaws design

A lot more of horizontal gameplay in Boston ruins
Settlements system.
Weapon crafting/customization. Unfortunately, this came at the unnecessary cost of having fewer weapon types and unique weapons compared to previous Fallout games. 

Common FPS mechanics like gun bashing, sprinting, dedicated grenade hotkey, and peeking around corner.

Power armor.
Building and construction which is the big part of the game.
Story makes virtually no sense, and I don't think Bethesda actually, seriously understands the "point" of the games.

Gameplay, series-wise is par-none.  

I love NV to death.  I think it's one of the most interesting examples of narrative media I've ever seen, but it fucking sucks gameplay-wise.  It's misery to play that game.  You feel like your fucking feet are on backwards with every WAS and D.

Fallout 4 felt like playing a video game.  Like a real, interactive video game.  It felt intuitive.  I knew what I was doing.  It was immersive.

The story has holes big enough to fly a Vertibird through and just makes no sense in general, and it didn't have any really interesting ideas, but it was more playable than the other stuff.
Gunplay.

 Hands down
The graphics were a huge step up from 3 and NV. I personally don’t get the hate for the story, I thought it was fascinating. Also really loved settlement building. Idk there are so many ppl who look at old games thru rose colored glasses like they had 0 flaws. OG fallout fans did the same when 3 came out. It was “too different” and Bethesda “ruined the series.” Now the same is said about 4 when compared to 3/NV.
Gunplay
IMHO, I love The Lone Survivor and the story. I prefer the courier's story but I still enjoy the lone survivor.

That said, I think the combat in Fallout 4 is great!
For me is how enemies act. Ghouls charge at you at hella speed and weaves. Moles actually digs and flanks you. Bloat flies actually swarms you.
Crafting, settlement building, the power armour, the amount of companions (though NV is pretty good on that front), morally grey BBEG,
Gun Customization is one of the best things 

While the settlement system wasn’t perfect it’s actually pretty good
A few things.

1: Throwing a grenade without having to holster your weapon, this makes combat much more fluid, no having to but away my varmint rifle to pull out a dynamite to try and blow up that fiend hiding behind something. 

2: Being able to see all the non-companion perks before committing your starting S.P.E.C.I.A.L points, I really only played fallout new vegas before hand but I had to decide my build before seeing if I missed out on cool, unless I go to an external site like a game wiki to see options or have played enough to know what the cost of certain skills are. In fallout 4 you can take a second after getting the pitboy to see if you have the points in each path to get what you actually want early game, it also gives hints of things you can do later, you can then tweak before leaving the vault if you decide you want something earlier enough to sacrifice in other trees.

3: Everything has value as either caps or materials which makes looting better, in NV many items were not worth taking unless you have extra space as they were low sell values, for example empty cans which sell for very little caps for their weight requirements. In 4 all the normally junk things have a value in terms of crafting materials, that empty can is made of steel, useful for construction and gear modification.

4: Base building, fallout 4 has way better housing options than NV did and makes it more obvious (i didn't know you could get a base in NV) the more plentiful outposts lets you choose a perfect place to make your house and the better customization lets you make a house that looks good if you have the skill for that but also functionality, letting you make all the workstations in one convenient workshop, storage for gear meant to be used occasionally such as power armor (take your core out) and heavy weapons that are not needed for your average fight with bandits, planted crops and water collectors let you restock on food for your next adventure, this power only increases if you go down the minutemen missions until the opening of the armory in the castle basement where you unlock artillery support in addition to the flares, letting you establish a zone of backup as you expand your influence. 

5: Weapon modifying, I only saw a handful of attachments in fallout NV in my time playing that were all premade and would normally be attached to pre determined points on a weapon such as attaching a silencer or scope. In 4 you can remake basically the whole weapon on most of them, this is first noticed on pipe guns, being able to change their barrels and stock/grip to change its size, the receiver to determine what ammo it uses and how it behaves, the sights for what range you want it to be for and what mag type for how it handles.

6: Legendries, in fallout 4 many of the legendary augments can appear on various weapons which combined with the weapon modding can result in some truly horrifying weapon combos. 

My favorite weapon I ever had was the first legendary I ever got, a pipe rifle with the kneecapper mod. The kneecapper gives each bullet a 20% chance to cripple the enemy's leg regardless of hit location. With some modifying I made a full auto, rapid fire gun with a large drum mag shooting the cheapest and most common round of .38 in the game to nearly instantly cripple the legs of anything unfortunate to have them.
The combat.
Weapon modification.
Disclaimer - not including classical fallouts, as they are mostly incomparable 

Granade mechanic
Non humanoid enemies, in general (however I whould prefer new vegas deathclaws, they suppose to be "holy shit" type of enemy untill very late game, after all, they are designed bioweapons), this may even be better then in classical fallout 
Chems mechanics (basically you now have an option to include them in your build, without going junky route)
I whould say vats is better, due to set of perks.
Power armor looks (not mechanics)
This might be pretentious to say but power armor is done very well.
The PC having an audible voice. It adds so much. My personal favorite is taking a jab of Psycho and he screams "FUCKING KILL!" as you run into a nest of gunners with Pickett's.
Weapon use in general improved, and being able to throw grenades and perform a melee attack without needing to go to your inventory is nice.  Sprinting is also nice.
The gameplay is the best of the 3d games. Guns and armor feel good to use. Crafting, settlements, and mods are fun. Sprinting, grenade throwing, and gun bashing are all welcome additions to combat.
Animations in general.
great art style and designs and you can tell they researched, settlement/crafting system, much better world design and map, of course much better gunplay and technically improved in every way, the best at all of this actually
Looting, shooting and exploration.
Settlement building and mods
Like 95% is better. The bad stuff is the dialogue, removal of skills and somewhat lackluster cities
Power armor for sure, it actually feels like it has power lol. In the older games its just like a regular set of armor and nothing special
Power armor, power armor modification, Gunplay, Gun modification, layered armor, armor modification, Companion will interact with each other, better graphic, better 3rd person animation.
Adding a sprint button
Power Armour

Weapon/gameplay in general

Defined factions as opposed to loose connections between groups (Fallout 3)

Environment - the Commonwealth is a good setting, the glowing sea is amazing, etc.
The sprint function
It's a better shooter than the others, probably because the others were trying to be RPGs and shooters at the same time (except classic fallout those are just RPGs )
Took me years to even know this could be done, but moving in VATS while taking actions. 

I think it creates the best version of VATS, allowing you to wait for an opponent to move if you want, but also letting *you* move into better positions while auto-attacking.
Sprinting

Perception affects chance to hit in VATS again (wtf 3/NV)

Grenades can be equipped while still using another weapon.

All junk items in the game have purpose

The crafting system in general

Power Armor actually feels like a walking tank

Power. Armor. Jet. Pack.

The Far Harbor DLC's setting and tone

More perks, and every perk has multiple ranks. Even some of the "increase damage by x%" perks also come with bonuses to range, armor penetration, etc


Nick Valentine (IMO) is the best companion to be in any Fallout game and his quest, plus his additions to Far Harbor are fantastic

Non-VATS gunplay feels much better, even included a lean mechanic when aiming down sights at the edge of a wall

Survival Mode adds features like adrenaline, reduced carry weight, and increased lethality for both enemy AND your attacks. Much better than New Vegas's Hardcore mode, IMO.
Gunplay, crafting, settlement building, Power Armor, companions, creature design, the Glowing Sea, ambient soundtrack, the color palette.

It would easily be the best game if it had more competent writing.
The gunplay and crafting is fun. Power Armor is also really cool although it should be more durable
survival mode.  settlement system.
Settlements and the weapon/armor crafting and modifying systems. Settlements were just the next natural progression imo and the updated crafting was the best part of 4 imo
I think the world design is the best in fo4
While I do miss true unique weapons, I do like being able to upgrade my favorite weapons to carry me through the endgame. And some of the Legendary effects are damn handy Temporary time slow effect while sighting through my 10mm? Yes please!

I also really love how Bethesda did Power armor in 4. Everything from the size to the sound design makes it feel like you’re in the walking tank it’s supposed to be. Yeah, and the enter-exit animation is way more entertaining to me than it should.
I just love the settlement system so damn much.
Power armor
Combat
Probably everything besides some parts of the writing and the dialogue system. Quite in fact, it's my favorite fallout
I’d say pretty much everything except the perk system and story.
    Yeah especially with the perk system. The level up system I like since you don't have to clear enemies just to level up, it's just the perk choosing part that sucks
I love the power armor in FO4. It's the mech suit I always wanted it to be.
The actual gameplay is just so much better.


3 and NV are better RPGs but 4 just feels better to play.
Power armor, general gunplay(although the weapon variety suffered a bit), and in most technical aspects, it's obviously improved over the older games.

I also enjoy the pipboy from 4, feels more tactile and less like a UI, and the ability to make it display whatever color I like.
Maybe I just haven’t scrolled far enough through the comments, but I can’t believe I haven’t seen anyone mention settlement building yet. That mechanic didn’t even exist before FO4 and it was what I spend most of my time on in it.
    Plenty of people mentioned settlement building but I agree
Weapon customization, though I’m not a big fan of the weapon designs

Verticality was really refreshing

Power armour felt like **power armour**

Enemies felt more unique with a variety of special attacks and weaknesses

Armor layering though it could be better 

Gunplay is so so much better 

Base customization, though they took it too far
How you can use anything for scrap. I felt it made the post-apocalyptic world more immersive.
Putting the "Power" in Power Armor
I don’t know how anyone else feels about it but I actually love the settlement building, I’ve literally spent days beefing up and designing settlements. Also Dogmeat
Real quick, I have heard the criticisms and they really sound nit-picky or are just stupid
Gunplay and customisation was a major improvement imo
Combat.
You could level up your special stats unlimited
The unique characters.
Gunplay 

Weapon and armor customization 

Crafting in general 

Base building
Radiant quests
The perk system is more simple and easy to understand than other games. You are encouraged to be a pack mule and constantly have a flow of scrap to upgrade gear. You have a tangible impact on the Commonwealth building buildings for survivors and creating defensive structures and crops. Gunplay feels great and ADSing doesn't feel like pulling my elbow slightly further back. Conversations feel more realistic with people not inherently trusting you and spilling their guts at the slightest sign of you being a decent person. There isn't mines literally everywhere, they're typically in spots raiders and other naughties would want to protect. Graphically everything may seem rather "smooth" but it makes sense for the time period they are trying to represent. Power armor isn't just armor ++.
This whole thread is making me wanna replay. I got a huge list of games I wanna replay, and this just fired up Fallout 4 to top of the list
Despite still being dice roll shooting, it has really improved gunplay.

It's modding system is second to none, can do more things, and is so healthy I literally made YT partner off doing Fallout 4 videos in 2024. It can add as much depth as you'd like to the game, either lore accurate or inaccurate.

It's got a good location. The Commonwealth feels like a very New England, and by extension east coast, place.

Voice actors for Nate/Nora are good at what they do, unfortunately their role in the game took away from it.

Settlements. I can't imagine Fallout without them now, although it did take away from having more interactable/larger POIs, but this is easily remedied with quest mods that add locations

It did quite a bit right, and I think it really is one of the only games that strictly gets better with age
Gameplay by a wide margin.
Yeah , 3 and Vegas have their charm and you can do some cool stuff. But fallout 4s gameplay just kinda works, it feels good, doesn't take any gimmicks, it's just good.
- Combat
- Weapon Mods
- Armor
- Power Armor
- Scavenging
- Exploration

I also think it did DLC, side quests, and main quest better then 3 and it’s environment is better then the Mojave.
Almost everything, including those things, people are just blinded by nostalgia
Weapon modding.

They were actual mods and not a fixed set of upgrades called mods
Gunplay was a *huge* improvement. I played fallout 4 first, so it just felt standard to me, similar to other shooters like cod or battlefield. When I started playing NV, it felt so *ancient*? It’s hard to describe, but certain mechanics, like the recoil felt weird, like the recoil in NV just bounces up, but not back. I get that the game is from 2010, but other games from the period did gunplay better. Back to my original point, 4 just had fluid gun mechanics that felt easy to use, and enjoyable to play with. The new weapon modification system is great too, but I do wish it had a *little* more leniency on things, rather than certain attachments just being completely redundant the *second* you get a few more materials to get the other one.
Companion management.  NV had similiar mechanics, but bugged
The gunplay and just the controls over all are just a lot better. It's probably the most fun out of the 3D games to just play.

I'm not saying old game = bad controls. There's lots of older games that control really well, a good example is Halo it's a 2001 game and it's feels better then FNV and FO3 to control. Like those games feel rough to play at times especially if you're more adjusted to newer games.

Also the DLCs in my opinion are better, as FO3s and NVs just feel like chores to play at least for me. Like I don't get excited to play of them, while with FO4s I just find more enjoyment but I do have a bit of nostalgia for them so that might be helping.

The character customization is a lot better as well, even if I don't really fuck around with it much.

It also has a pretty solid overworld, a lot better then NV in my opinion. It's just a lot more interesting, it also feels a little more post apocalyptic then NV to me as well. Simply because of how big the destroyed cities are.

I can go on, and please don't take this as me saying FO4 is perfect. Because it's not like at all, but none of the Fallout games are in my opinion. This is just what I think 4 does better then the previous titles.
swapping weapons on the fly
Gun play for sure, I also really like how the power armour feels. It feels way more powerful than the ones in previous games.

I also like the rocket shaped nuka cola and crafting system, adds a lot of freedom to your guns that can be expanded with mods

I like the HUD redesign from previous games

I really like the pip boy, it's simple and you can find most things in it

I like the perk chart and the new perks that were added like the pain train

I like that we get a slight look into how the pre war world looked like

I like how they redesigned the vaults

I like how the new ghouls look like as well as other enemies like the deathclaw
Gun play is the obvious, very good modding platform and base, obviously graphics, customization of armor and clothes, more to do with companions, once again mods because I love them. The final bit being crafting and base building. Incredible features truly. Though for some god damn reason I can’t have more than 3 save slots :(
I liked building bases and setting up multiple cities, supply lines, fortifying bases, etc. I thought it added a fun extra dimension to the game. I miss that with 76.
The story is a lot better. I love the Dweller out of time theme. Plus the Institute is a pretty neat boogeyman to follow up with from Fallout 3.
You can whack people with your gun.
Combat
The gunplay and customization was 100% improved
Gun play is infinitely more fun

Weapon customization from FNV’s mods were an incredible step-up 

Power armor, while losing its rareness factor thanks to power armor training no longer being a thing, is much more fun to use than the oddly proportioned power armor from FO3 and FNV. Still,
I will always prefer finding the T-51b via its associated quest in vanilla fo3 to any other fallout game’s power armor acquisition route. 

In general, voice acting.

Workbenches in general were one of the best additions to any fallout game period

The permutations given to unique/legendary weapons were hit or miss, but when they hit they were so much more interesting than FO3/NV’s typical critical hit rate/DMG up. 

Also, most of the redesigns in FO4 are the best the series has ever been. Although due to nostalgia I still prefer a lot of FO3 and FNV’s shared artstyle to 4, it’s just obvious which game looks the best.
It improved the power armor, of course the removal of the PA perk is a downside….but it got the actual scale right that 3 and NV just didnt hit the bar
Gunplay
Gunplay, world design, player homes (settlements), looting (every bit of junk being useful is genius and I love it. Plus real time looting interface is huge), power armor.
Gunplay, power armor, companions, grenades, crafting, settlement-building, a fucking sprint button, Survival difficulty, graphical presentation, character models and animations, you can bash your enemy with your gun at melee range, better Pip-boy UI, much better selection of mods.

I also really like having a voiced protagonist and the cinematic dialogue camera.
I love all the fallout games I think honestly the way they made the deathclaws and power armor were awesome also the hardcore mode feels like a hardcore mode. They made it way better than new Vegas hardcore
Shooting was super janky and not fun in Fallout 3 and NV. I’m so glad they improved it FPS style in 4. Hate running out of fusion cores though… they could at least last longer.
PA.
Looting. Not having to click into a body or chest to loot was so much better.
Crafting, gunplay, settlements and finally a voiced protagonist! Only downside with the voiced protagonist is they dumbed down the dialog options but playing as this mute wierdo that everyone but us hears is quite annoying
Settlements were a fantastic addition that every BGS needed since Morrowind.
I like customizing guns. Was fun and motivated me to aquire skills to make juuuuuust the revolver I wanted
Gun play at the front, world design second
In order of impressiveness (IMO): the junk economy, companions, Survival Mode, gunplay and combat AI, dungeon design, enemy variety, the settlement and crafting systems (in theory), power armour (conceptually), and multi-layered apparel (as an idea - it was underwhelming in practice). A lot of those systems are linked - and linked even harder on Survival difficulty - which makes for a really engaging and fun time when they’re working right.

Unfortunately, Fallout 4 also has a lot of problems that directly counter many of those features. It’s annoying to me that a game which is so ambitious and fits together so well in some areas is such a disappointment - and even an outright regression from NV and 3 - in others.
Graphics, sound, gunplay, power armor (not lorewise imo, but definitely in terms of style), the scrap and crafting, base building/player homes.

It's a shame this came at the expense of writing, locations, RP, etc. Because Fallout 4 was and is very good at the power fantasy aspect of taming the wasteland.
The scrap system is actually worth something. The gunplay is miles better, as are the graphics (even if they were outdated by the time it released). You can sprint. There are settlement building options (that I always swear I'll make use of and still only end up fortifying red rocket and living like a recluse).

There was a lot of good it did, it was just outshone by the bad that came with it.
getting rid of skills so attributes matter more, turning skills into perks making them have a tangible effect, a satisfying gameplay loop... just kind of a lot of stuff tbh. it's a very good game overall with a few flaws.
Things that are improved compared to previous games? Combat, Armour system, gunsplay, weapon attachments, Power Armour, Followers, and crafting. Surely there's more.

Then there's the new stuff that I personally think makes the game stand out and almost equal to 3 or NV. Which is settlement building, gun customization  and gun bashing. Being able to craft so much and making every little bit of stuff everywhere actually useful. 

Personally I don't think a lot of the characters suck, Bethesda usually writes people pretty well. I personally think most of Fallout 4's companions stand out and are better than most of 3 and NV's companions. Although I've never had Raul or Arcade Gannon so maybe I'm severely missing out but Fallout 4 is all slam dunks when it comes to it's companions. Although I can't speak for Curie or strong cuz I've never met them, they seem cool and the internet loves them. 

But damn Nick Valentine, McCready, Cait, Piper Danse and Hancock are are slam dunks. They are all so memorable. That can't be said for NV or 3. At least in my eyes. Fawkes is my absolute favourite from 3. NV I don't really have a favourite. Nick Valentine is damn near perfection as a companion
It looked better visually and that’s about it in my opinion.
As a notorious fallout 4 hater I have to say bad building and weapon customization. I like that scrap has meaning in this game
As someone who has grown to really dislike the crafting trend in Bethesda games (and in general); loot menu is the best thing Bethesda has done for their games in for ever love it! It’s an essential mod for older Bethesda games too which is cool to see.
If fallout 4 wasn't branded as a fallout game I think people would really love it
Honestly for me it is the Power Armor. It felt great using it. But thats it. 
Fallout 4 has the best gameplay of any fallout game, hard to argue against that. Now the theme, the characters, the story is subjective imo
Fallout 4 actually does a lot of things better than the previous games honestly. It has the best gunplay in the series and my favorite map to explore. Although I personally hate the settlement system I know a lot of people really like it as well. I have a friend that hates all the other Fallout games except Fallout 4 because they like the settlement system so much. Also the companions are well liked and Far Harbor is great. 

I think the reason why it's so controversial online though is that there's a lot of intrinsic design flaws that are baked into the core of the game and it makes it difficult to talk about online without running into criticism. For me the biggest one was the way that they handled the dialogue system. Limiting it to 4 options really limits what they can do with the story and honestly is kinda stupid. The old dialogue system was fine and did not need to be simplified in the first place and hiding what the player says behind generic 1 word replies like sarcastic actually made me stop playing the game on release. I think it's telling that most people that I see play the game these days have a mod for to fix the dialogue options, but even then they're still very limiting. 

Other stuff like the voiced protagonist and simplified RPG mechanics also hold the game back as well IMO. Luckily mods can partially fix some of these issues at least.
The dialogue choices >!/s!<
Fallout 4 had much worse dialogue than 3 but much better combat
For the most part I really liked the companions, though I am sad to see their very limited interactions between each other because every time I swapped people out they’d have little comments and jabs at each other and it was really cool to see I just wish they did more of that.
I see there are close to 200, but I can't either read them all or stay silent, so I'll say it: nothing
Gunplay - this one in Fallout 3/NV feels like a spellcasting in Morrowind
shooting guns felt a bit better.
Gun mods, always wanted more

Sprinting is nice
I always thought of 4 as an improvement in every single way, they just forgot it was supposed to be an RPG. Which left me wanting.
I think Fallout:New Vegas ruined me. But I can at least admit that Fallout 4 gunplay was pretty solid. Everything else I didn’t really care for. I was 28 when Fallout: 4 released though. So, the crafting and building was a time sink in my opinion.
Modular weapons and armor upgrades, legendary loot, and easy access modular power armor in conjunction with the scrapping system made the game really fun to go out and scavage for. There's just a lot of little things that together make it a fun open world experience.
It looks better.....
Run.
Being stable (at least for me)
Actually modding the guns was fun but it makes the variety of guns available kind of trash.
Combat in almost every way
Better graphic and combat..story and lore wise, other fallouts surpassed 4
Comedy
Imo Bethesda doesn't understand fallout very well.
power armor, and only that
I think almost everything about Fallout 4, other than anything that involves writing (so like, the story, the characters, etc.), is better. Everything else is amazing. It kinda sucks that all the lore and story stuff sucks, because I can't imagine what an amazing game it would have been if that stuff was good.
More marketing and more hype
I liked the plugin Sim Settlement. Until the time the plugin maker started thinking it should be a program on its own and be all automated. The fun of building a settlement is building the settlement myself. There should have been no hooks into automation. I really liked it, but after awhile I think it seems to been overdone to the point of destabilizing the game. Really nice plugin that would have been great if he'd followed less is more. The game itself, it's OK. Go out, fight some shit, do some exploring. Find enough junk to sell in settlement in order to build more. Etc. Overall I think it was a good game because of decent plugins.
Bugs
A CIA agent once took over a country. It became a drug haven and  the US invaded to get rid of him
No one says the characters suck ass lol
The guns and sprint were great. Well, the gunplay. The machine gun and a few others were stupid looking
Architecture. Seeing the art deco/retrofuturism in the buildings was a nice change. Fallout 3 particularly just felt like modern America ruins rather than an exploration into what the Fallout world's 2077 would've looked like. New Vegas has the Western & Vegas thing down but both would've benefited from that art direction I think.

As others mentioned:
- How Power Armor worked as a suit to climb into rather than just an equipped set was inspired. Ironically this would've been the best time to gate it behind Power Armor training.
- Hotkey grenades & gun bash.
- Obviously graphics & most fps gameplay elements.

Things I *don't* like and don't want back:
- Gun & armor crafting. The way F4 did it led to less unique models & types of guns in the game because mechanically they were all imbedded into the upgrade paths. It also had some weird side effects on immersion & realism for some of the changes to stats & functionality to weapons imo. I much prefer F3 & NV's version of an expanded weapon roster, uniquely modeled legendaries (rather than spawning bonus effects), and a limited but impactful selection of mods for the weapons.
- Settlements. It obviously took away half of the map's potential for towns, neighborhoods, NPCs & quests etc. Give me 1-3 home bases the size of Red Rocket I can do the Settlement stuff at maybe. At least the decorations side of it is nice for personalization.
- By virtue of the above two, the scrap system. I *like* the scrap system a lot and thought it was inspired. But without either of the above, I'm not sure what purpose it would serve in the game anymore. Also, the "loot, scrap, craft/settlement" loop added onto the Bethesda Explore-Combat-Loot loop is what led to most all of F4's design ills as an RPG like F3 & especially NV. I think they were chasing the gameplay loops in their design decisions more than building a deep RPG.
The problem is that f4 is just too different from 12nv and even three to make direct comparisons
I love the fact that you can have all your companions at the same location AND give them something to do on top of that. The settlement building is nice too despite it being a bit choppy, it feels good to build your own little place of interest in the fallout world plus the random attacks you’ll get against your camp help with the immersion. I also enjoyed being able to create my own robots with the automaton dlc. Needless to say, I had a great summer.
Well look...Fallout 3 has a better storyline but 4 has better graphics and overhaul with faction interaction and the like.. they are both great games imo
Being able to do melee attacks with a gun and using grenades like in any other FPS.
Companions and relationships
Character development mechanics and Combat; Power Armor finally feels like a personal vehicle or exoskeleton, as opposed to previous games where it was basically a suit of clothing with better stats.
for me its gameplay
Combat. 

Just combat.
Compared to Fallout 3, it did a lot of good. Compared to Fallout 1-2, not so much. Oh and New Vegas is still 100x better Fallout game than anything Bethesda ever produced.
To be honest, pretty much everything in my opinion. I am biased because I started with FO4, but it just feels so much better. A better HUD, being able to use iron sights, actually having a use for junk, being able to claim and build your own settlements, companions being both romancable and unkillable, and more companions in general.

Edit: also better graphics, because I can’t stand bad graphics.
    You can use iron sights in new vegas. Graphics should be better anyway considering it came out 5 years.
Companions
Power Armor.

I don't like the writing of F4.  I don't like the dialog system. I don't like the characters. I don't like the settlement system.  I don't like the scrapping system where some screws in a broken prewar desk fan become more valuable to a settlement than ammunition of medicine.  I generally don't like Fallout 4 very much.  All that said, I really think they nailed the feel of power armor, and the game mechanics of it are a vast improvement over previous titles imo.  


Also, I know you only asked for one thing, but verticality.  I'm not sure if other games have tackled it better, I don't play shooters much, but F4 did a better job of giving the city height and using it than other Fallout games.
Nothing
There were some nice quality of life improvements but that's about it
Nothing. It took crafting too far. It made the settlement mods of the era integral and boring, and it put a weird sheen and fiction onto a series that didn't need it. Fallout was better with real guns and a rough legacy. Shiny curves and weird assault rifles did no favors. The voiced protagonist was terrible 5 shows they listened) and the game was just fine. But it started a shitty trend of TOO MUCH CRAFTING which Bethesda is now intent on keeping. Skyrim was JUST right. But Fallout 4 making you constantly collect junk, which now Starfield does, was infuriating.
Not being a Role Playing Game.
                                 Fallout
*A POST NUCLEAR ROLE PLAYING GAME*
Marketing.

Whether it was because of the times or Blask Isle's marketing skills, Fallout 1 and 2 were advertised pretty casually. Say what you will about Todd, the lying prick knows how to advertise a game beyond its worth. He knows all the right people, plans out ahead and not to mention lies better than most politicians. I'm convinced in another universe, he's probably one of the most I famous snake-oil merchants in history.
Gun play was drastically improved and had some weight to it.
    Yes! It felt so good. I would often sit and just listen to firefights in the distance cus the sound was so good
        I have a mod installed that alters some sounds to be a tad more realistic and the sound of gun fights in the distance is so satisfying to listen to
            I’ve had some of those too what’s the best one you have heard ?
    The next Fallout combat will be incredible. Starfield got a lot of hate for a variety of reasons, but the gunplay and combat is incredibly well done.
Gun bash too
    This most recent playthrough has made me really appreciate power armored bayonet bashes during ghoul fights. Being able to get one off you then reload is super useful.
        well your name is death corp of krieg so i am not suprised that you find bayonet good.
            Purge the unclean
                For the emperor of mankind and sigmar and tiber septim
    This!
    Those two things being the same damn button has cost me tens of hours.
Too much crafting talk, not enough this^
    I mean I loved those too but omg holding the right bumper to through a grenade and have that a separate thing from my main gun?! It was heaven lol
        Meanwhile I’m over here fucking not even using melee because I keep throwing molotovs when I want to punch lol
            lol I do that by accident too
And sprint
Yeah, but you can't use vats to throw grenades like you could in 3 and NV, so more a downgrade in my book.
    Yeah but you can still target them so there’s that.
I loved FO4's crafting system. 

Hate Starfield's. Don't get why they messed with perfection.
    Because they tried so hard not to make fallout 4 in space that they ended up making fallout in space, but worse.
        First it was Oblivion with guns, now it’s Fallout in space. Next is Starfield with _____?
            good writing
        Once they release the modding tools I hope we can go back to Fallout in space. 

First Bethesda game where I feel like mods are a requirement to enjoy the game. Put maybe a dozen hours in it and decided it's not worth it in the current state. 

And it's largely because the inventory, crafting, and building are all exactly that. FO4 but worse. I quit when my inventory became too full for my ship and had to try to build my first outpost.
            The modding tools won't change it much.

People mod when they already love a product. It's a force amplifier.

That's why New Vegas is still getting big mods, people adored it.

I've seen a lot of modders openly say they won't be bothered with Starfield, and I'm not surprised.
                Really depends on what you don’t like about it I guess. The things I didn’t like can absolutely be fixed with mods/ updates. But I also didn’t play very far so it’s possible even fixing those issues I might quit playing. 

I don’t expect it to be this massive thing that rivals Skyrim or New Vegas with years and years of support. I’d settle for it just being less tedious so I can finish a single playthough.
                    The Bad companions, bad worldbuilding, bad lore, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad ending... I mean, unless shipbuilding is your thing to a huge degree, there isn't much redeemable about the game.
                        As I said, depends on what you don't like I guess. For you it sounds like that's "everything" and you're right, mods aren't going to fix all that. 

For me it wasn't terrible just mediocre and I can see updates/ mods making it playable for me. I definitely don't expect that to be the case for everyone.
                            Well yeah, that's what I'm saying, the game was fundamentally bad at most things. Fundamentally, it's boring and uninspired, so modders aren't capable of fixing it.
                It’s the #16th most modded game of all time and modding tools aren’t even out yet. Can’t wait for you to eat these words when it’s in the top 5
                    I see that as pretty doubtful. Bethesda has a dedicated modding community, people will certainly hop on either way to a degree. Notice the top five are all Bethesda.

But people DO mod games because they enjoy them, and Starfield was... well, shit.

It was probably one of the top 5 biggest disappointments in gaming history, to be honest.
                        *in your opinion

Again, get a fucking grip. You aren’t the arbiter of truth. Art is subjective. I love Starfield. Is my opinion wrong? Fucking no. We both have different opinions. Except I don’t state mine as fact. Downvote me all you want, if you disagree with this you’re either mentally or literally a child.
                            "Art is subjective" is always something people go to when they like shitty art.

You can think New Vegas is a bad video game, for example, or that LOTR: Gollum is the greatest masterpiece in gaming history, but yeah, I'd say you have poor taste in video games. We do have general criteria for art, and for video games, and generally, Starfield fails them.

Bad companions, bad worldbuilding, bad lore, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad ending... I mean, unless shipbuilding is your thing to a huge degree, there isn't much redeemable about the game.
                                New Vegas is probably my favorite game of all time, yet Starfield is in my top 3 games of 2023, and in my top 5 Bethesda games. 

People can like things and still recognize flaws and room for improvement. Starfield was the first game to fully suck me in since Fallout 4. I did 200+ hours on Xbox, and now I have over 70 hours on PC. 

Why do you think all of the things you listed are bad? In my opinion, the main companions were fine, about on par with Fallout 4's, and reintroducing "lesser" followers like Skyrim had was a great touch. "Bad plot" is pretty broad and vague, considering there are  5 different full storylines. The main quest was good but could've been great if there was more to it than just fetch quests. The ending of the main story was good, too. The quest with the final battle against the Hunter and the Emissary was lots of fun and very unique, and the actual ending with the Unity was satisfying enough.The UC Vanguard was genuinely great and probably the best in the game. SysDef/Crimson Fleet, Ryujin, and the Freestar Rangers were all good, but Ryujin and Freestar Rangers definitely suffered from being too short. The lore is good, typical Bethesda quality, but I do agree that the actual world building was very weak.
                                I don’t argue with children or manchildren, which you have now well demonstrated yourself to be. Go drink your sippy cup and eat your dino nuggies
            I sometimes feel like the only person who LOVED Starfield. Absolutely has it fair share of problems, and definitely isn’t my favorite BGS game, but it’s hard for me to hate on it too much. I put 150 hours in within a month of it coming out. It was one of those games where when I wasn’t playing it I was thinking about playing it. 

Give me mods that add more variety to POIs and make them closer together, survival mode to give me a reason to build outposts and keep that mechanic from feeling useless, and I think SF could easily climb up in my rankings in a similar way that Fallout 4 did for me once modders got it.
            >First Bethesda game where I feel like mods are a requirement to enjoy the game.

You obviously didn't play 76 at launch. Lol

It's much better now. But it was pretty lame.
                Alot of us saw the promised and then the timeline= cash grab
                I've tried at least four times to play 76. I hate it. It feels nothing like Fallout to me. I wish I liked it, but I always go back to FO4 or New Vegas.
                    It's not for everyone. I'm not a die hard player either. I'll usually play for a month or two. Then wait 6 months to a year and then play for another couple months. That way I have new content to play through each time. I eventually get bored with it and go do something else.
                        What kind of new content do they have? I’ve never played games with ‘seasons’ or that are continually updated. I always see a new promo for different content but don’t understand how to access it. The game always seems the same to me.
                            What's new depends on the last time you played I guess. The seasons are just different themed reward tiers that they have where you earn items like armor and atoms(the currency used to buy premium items). So you don't have to pay much attention to them. 

But they have had several large updates outside the seasons. They added a lot of NPCs and several quest lines for factions like the raiders and the brotherhood of steel. There's actually people to interact with now instead of robots. There are a lot more events, that each offer unique rewards, some tied to factions and some not. These are just in game quests and events that you get for playing the game. No need to "access", it's free if you own the game. You may need to look up how to start each quest line as sometimes they're not obvious, but I have to do that for 4 and NV too. 

There's another large update coming in June I think, where they will expand the map for the first time and add more quest lines. 

I'm not trying to talk it up. Like I said it's not for everyone.  But if you haven't been on in a few years I would give it another shot. It's becoming more like fallout, though it still has a lot of the MMO feel to it.
                                Thanks for the info. I really feel so behind when it comes to this stuff, just got stuck playing RPGs for years and missed out on most of the big MMOs and battle royale games. I hit my late twenties and stopped trying to keep up haha. I’ll probably give it another shot once I get bored with my most recent FO4 play through
                            i think today or yesterday they just added an entire new location and questline. and they add new expeditions and questlines all the time. 

also just various new items to collect from new events and the like
        I would have paid hand over fist for fallout 4 in space
        It's sad, all I wanted was Skyrim / Fallout in space.  Even if we made fun of Bethesda for being predictable, I think it's still what most of us wanted.
        I would have absolutely loved if they just made fallout 4 in space. Shit I'm still playing fallout 4 now, I played Starfield for maybe a month and not really digging it which is a bit sad really.
    I've really come around to FO4s system. The only improvement I think would be to have an actual list of everything you're collecting for that automatically un-sesrches components when you have enough for everything you're trying to build.

Too many times have I known I've needed a bunch of steel so picked up hundreds of it only to realise I need nowhere near that much once I get to the work bench.
    Everything in Starfield, their previous games did better. The only thing Starfield did better was sucking \*ss.
        The environment looks great. 

Too bad I have to make it a blurry mess with FSR to get any decent performance.
        Yeah, Skyrim had great space combat. 

Get a fuckin grip dude. Starfield is fine.
            Bro tried to say Starfield is fine
            You get a grip, "dude." You're "fine".
    I just started starfield today, the crafting is broken
    Man, That's why I'm afraid of fallout 5, TES6, the future of Bethesda makes me sad
    Idk looking high and low for duct tape and desk fans got boring. Starfield decentivized hoarding, I only collected a handful of things for the sciences I specialized in.
    💯 
That’s all I wanted. Well, not all. In fact I wanted a bunch of other things from Starfield too. They all failed. 
Definitely this. I tried to get into the work benches in 3 or new vegas but 4 was the best expansion to that idea yea
This right here.  Crafting is like 90% of why I ever replayed Fallout 4 after finishing the story the first time.  Going on specific scavenging runs looking for particular types of junk to break down into what you needed added such a great layer of immersion for me, and I loved it.
    Seriously. Scavenging has been a core part of the Fallout universe but it never really became an important part of the gameplay until 4
Except anything burnt… and folders. My nemesis.
    But folders had no weight it's like caps but with an exchange rate!
I encountered someone who said it was bad and broke their immersion because areas get repopulated with scrap and enemies.
Not really, it just forces me to fill my inventory with the most material efficient junk instead of shit I actually Want.

In New Vegas, I can fill my inventory with all my good shit - in 4 I need to leave a 50+ lb space for junk. Terrible loop.
    Tbf, you force yourself to do that.
I would contest this, as this shifts away the game design from Fallout and more to Skyrim.

You no longer explore the world through quests and story, but go on a glorified junk hunt. A gameplay loop that is completely out of place in Fallout.
    Scavenging old world ruins for supplies is far more appropriate for Fallout than the Elder Scrolls.
    >go on a glorified junk hunt

No one wants to hear about how you spend your Friday evenings ;)
    I’m currently replaying through 3 and I’m enjoying it so much precisely because I’m not constantly looking for a specific type of junk. Also not a fan of the settlement system. IMO I’ve never been able to get into 76 no matter how many times I go back and give it another try because it just takes the direction 4 went to the extreme and without mods to circumvent the minutia it’s just too tedious for me to enjoying playing it.
        3 is worse if you actually want to craft anything, since you need a specific “recipe” of very particular pieces of junk. I much prefer the 4 style “scrap for raw materials” option. 

The one thing I miss from 3’s mechanics is the ability to repair items with duplicate or same type items, outside of a workbench. So much nicer for looting and keeping your guns shipshape!
    I’d like to argue that it enhances the world of fallout because now it’s even more incentive to explore
        Story and quests should be your incentive, not searching for more junk. It's supposed to be an RPG, not a post nuclear Minecraft.
            What incentive do I have to explore this raider base in a cave? No quest brings me here, no story is here. Why should I even bother?
                Because story would lead you there? If you want shooting and looting, Fallout is the wrong franchise for you.
                    Story ties into quest, dont be obtuse just because you hate an honestly great improvement.
                        Where's the improvement you speak of? BGS abandoned quality storytelling in favor of cheap exploration for junk. Of you want exploration done right by them look at Morrowind. You didn't need any junk for crafting to encourage exploring.
                            Abondaned quality storytelling? Man, didnt know people didn't like the Institute because they're evil assholes, or the Brotherhood because the Brotherhood is overbearing.

Exploration done right? Look at Fallout 4, I can actually be a scavver, scavving in different locations for specific scrap to build and repair things. Or I can just explore those locations when ***STORIES OR QUESTS*** take me to them.

Cry hard my guy, Bethesda added an extra reason to explore places and you just want to be a Bethesda Bad Bro.
                                Dude, what the hell are mumbling about? No matter where you look in F4 it's bad quality writing all over the place.

If you want to have games that just lead you around in search of junk for your next crafting project, take your toys and go somewhere else. Right now your line of argumentation is ridiculous. Bethesda did Interplay dirty, then simply outbid Troika for Fallout, and it's been a downhill ride since then - because of people who act like you. Somebody took a precious museum, then turned it into a cheaply made night club. Then drones like you complain that people who liked the museum dare to say that the museum was done better and had far more value. Sorry to break your fantasy, but people don't dislike Bethesda cause "Bethesda Bad", but because they had two interesting franchises and keep dumbing them down to attract as many casuals as possible to milk them dry.
I swear sometimes I hear doom music when I go charging in.
Gameplay wise Power Armor is LEAGUES better than the other games but I don’t love the lore retcons
    Does it really though?

And don't say fusion core, because PA has always required a "power pack" in the Lore.
        Well I think it’s the invention of the t-60, though idk if the lore ever said t-51 was the last power armor to be made it was still really odd to add it in such a way, I would’ve preferred if the t-60 was invented by the east coast BOS after the defeat of the east coast enclave. I know people were mad that fusion cores lasted so little because the description of power armor in fallout 1 & 2 was that it’s power pack could power it for over 200 years but considering fallout 4 is 210 years after the war it kind of makes sense a lot of fusion cores are running low. The only other lore complaint of power I’ve seen is seeing X-01 power armor in areas that seem to indicate it’s been there since the pre war era which seems to conflict with what people thought of the X-01 because people believed it was made by the enclave post war.
            Yeah agree with you on the T-60 and the X-01.

Although the T-60 is easier to explain. I always saw it as the T-51 was more widespread and considered the best and the T-60 was more newer and developed very close to when the bombs fell, and wasn't really used that much, like it wasn't as widespread as the T-51 until the brotherhood got it and started Mass producing.

The X-01 is harder to explain.

It can be chocked up to gameplay when finding it in the wild.

Although the one in Nuka World, That is impossible to explain
                > Although the one in Nuka World, That is impossible to explain

Yeah, the Quantum X-01 is a whole can of worms in and of itself.
                Don't you *dare* say anything bad about my precious Nuka T-51!!!
                    I was referring to the Quantum X-01
                the x01 is totally explained tho
                    How?

It was an Enclave original armor right?
                        if you want i can copy paste my comment ^^"

yes and no, the advanced power armor is the enclave one it is an upgrade of the x01 (wich is just a prototype)
                            Huh. I didn't know that. 

Do you know what terminal entry this is from?
                                from loading screen, fallout 76 whitespring enclave terminal and the fallout bible

ill try to put a transcript :

Fallout 4 loading screens: Power Armor was specially engineered and employed by remnants of the U.S. military after the Great War, and offers increased protection over the older, pre-war models

in the fallout Bible :2198 Enclave works on various new technologies, including Power Armor variations. None of these are much of an improvement over the conventional old school Power Armor, and some are actually worse.
2215 Under Presidential Order, Enclave scientists begin to work on an upgraded version of Power Armor. Many prototypes are developed and tested.
2220 October Enclave scientists develop a reliable version of the Mark II Power Armor. The prototype results (and accidents... and explosions... and deaths) are classified by order of the President Richardson for the sake of morale."

the enclave terminal :

Prototype Power Armor Schematics
--- TRANSFERED TO USER. --- ACCESSING ARCHIVAL ANNOTATION. //////////////////////////////////////////////// Beatherd,

These are the schematics for the experimental suit the members of the Joint Chiefs had been asking after. It's not even close to ready for primetime yet, but it's technically functional, so please get it logged.

I sent a second copy along to the rig, along with the Vertibird schematics. If anything goes wrong with your copy, you're going to have to speak with them.

- Ridgely //////////////////////////////////////////////// --- END ANNOTATION.

if theres more ill update you
            no the x01 isn't the enclave power armor, in terminal, nuka world etc or even about the enclave armor (rn i can't go on the wiki, if you want tomorrow),

the x01 is a prototype power armor.... the enclave taked it and made an upgrade, their own PA the advanced power armor
                Yeah that’s true but even then why is finding it based on level? You can find this rare prototype armor a bit too easily.
                    that's a gameplay perspective, imagine if you are high level and find a weak t45? so it is not much about lore because it is just for a gameplay
    Outside of Fusion cores the biggest lore retcon is that Power Armor Training is no longer required, but that was itself a lore retcon from Fallout 1 and 2 to fix balancing issues where players would get it too early. Fallout 4 fixed that gameplay problem by making PA require fuel, and as such is able to be more faithful to how PA functioned originally than 3 and New Vegas
eh, that is both hit and miss. the battery in these things is supposed to last centuries, not minutes.
    For the battery, I just chalk it up to gameplay
    It would basically be meaningless to have Fusion Cores in the game if each one lasted for centuries. You’d find one Core and never need any more for pretty much the rest of the game. 
Having them last for a couple minutes is just for game balance. 
        Leakage and sitting in an idling power generator for 210 years will cause issues with power retention.

I also see the Fusion Cores post war like the MK.1 chest Arc Reactor from Iron Man:-

Yinsen - "That could run your heart for fifty lifetimes!"

Tony - "Yeah... or something big for fifteen minutes."

Compared to lighting a building the size of the Concord museum in game, it doesn't really compare.
My only gripe with it is the running animation is a bit goofy.
Fallout 1 and 2 had this tho
    I actually felt like it was more impactful in the originals because it was a pretty massive power spike. Considering the difficulty of those games it felt like a massive achievement to earn PA. 

For Fallout 4 I never really felt like I needed power armor for anything since the world scales to your level pretty aggressively and the fusion cores made me just not use it even for fun. You also get it way too early as well so it doesn't feel earned imo.
    Its better, because it's in the "3d" real
        Better is highly subjective though. I could make an argument that Classic is better as no fusion cores are needed to use the armor
            I kind of agree with you, I think they handing you the power armor 20 minutes in the game   lead to them adding fusion cores and the, in my opinion, stupid armor condition (seriously, why these things even have durability while your everyday armor doesn't?) as balance reasons.

Since in the classic games it was an end game loot, these workarounds weren't necessary, so that's a good point.

However, for me, both the classics and 4 makes you feel very powerful in the power armor, but 4 has an advantage to feel better exactly because of the "3D feel" that was nonexistent in 3 an NV.
                True, but my point is that this gameplay element was already in the series, and a bit better as no condition to repair or use cores but they’re extremely limited
                    Right, I was focusing in the 3D aspect because 3 and NV messed this already existing element by making the power armor just be another piece of armor, while 4 took advantage of the gameplay mechanics.
            How is that better? Fusion cores provide a necessary balance and make it more realistic.
                How? I don’t mind Fusion Cores but they shouldn’t be 10-20 mins of use then need more. Technically it’s a retcon as the suits are supposed to last over a hundred years. 

Fallout 4 could be excused as it takes place 210 years after the War, but 76 confirms it as they have FCs and break down but not as quickly as in 4.
I'm sure it already exists as a mod but 3 and NV with all of 4's graphics, sound, etc would kick ass
    NV with 4’s graphics and crafting would be BALLIN
L
        There's currently a mod in the works that converts FO4 into base new vegas, not sure if its going to be keeping the crafting system but the gunplay and graphics will be in the new engine
            Heck, even just having new Vegas with player home customization would be nice.
            That’s never coming out
                Let me dream
    The ideal remake would be New Vegas with F4 Graphics and (some) of the content we missed on due to the cuts. Post-game stuff, more legion territory/a new legion companyon, some more options for the independent ending. Hell, if they want to get real crazy they could even add a fifth dlc. Could be cool
        "Could be cool" buddy I'd pay good money for that
    This shit. Right here. Put it in an iv drip into my veins. *droooools*
    i'm not gonna lie i love the shitty graphics of 3 and nv. it's just what fallout looks like to me
    There’s 2 seperate mod teams trying to upgrade Fallout 3 and NV entirely into Fallout 4s engine. I’m sure there’s plenty of mods for those games to make them more like 4 already though
    I’m weird in that i’d like some of the gameplay mechanics in Fallout 4 (like crafting and upgrades) but would prefer the movement and gunplay of Fallout NV and 3 lol
        Lack of sprint suuuuuuuuucks. Really need something between “instant fast travel” and “painfully slow jog”.
            I really just like the clunkiness of it. but if it had more features, i’d be all for it, like sprinting or grenade hotkey.
Getting in firefights in 4 is just so funnnnn
I don't really like how FO4 looks. Everything looks like plastic
    I feel like it technically looks better but sone things suffer. A lot of enemies do look more cartoonish like ghouls and deathclaws. Like graphically they are better, but I prefer the look of them in 3 and NV
    I think that the more stylised (or cartoony/plastic) graphics really do help with longevity. Fallout 4 is nine years old at this point but the graphics hold up much better than the more gritty and realistic graphics of the previous two games did at a similar point after their release. Worth thinking about for a game that doesn’t have a yearly release cycle.
I disagree with location design, but that’s it.
I play last couple weeks Fallout NV with TTW and a mod list. Went now to Fallout 4. Somehow grafics feel..comics like. Too bright, too shiny,  too happy

Then againyou have settlementand Sim settlement so  yeah .
New Vegas algae better Gunplay, gun design and Gun audio.
    Love new Vegas, but the gunplay is probably the worst part.
New Vegas is the best at that aspect
    On the contrary. New Vegas is notoriously poor at that aspect. All the other games laugh at New Vegas behind it's back about that aspect.
I looooove the enemies in 4 and how each got a different gimmick and weak spots. Crippling the legs of a feral ghoul will make it explode, causing them to fall on the ground and make effectively incapacitated. Deathclaws have their weak spot on their bellies and their movements try to hide them. Crippling the arms of a Protectron will cause to go on self destruct mode. Taking on someone in power armor? Shoot at the Power Core to pop them out of their shell. Dealing with a Mirelurk queen? Shoot at the glands to take the poison and larvae out of the equation.

Having a VATS build in FO4 is one of my favorite experiences with the franchise
    Severing a Deathclaw's tail will also make them extremely unbalanced, if I remember right.
I wasn't a fan of 4 for a lot of reasons, but 4 did Feral Ghouls better than any other game. The way they keep coming at you no matter what feels good.
    One time I shot off a feral ghouls head and it still kept coming at me, the only thing left of its face was it’s jaw but it still kept coming
Deathclaw design was one of the first things I thought of

4 is the only one I’ve played; watching videos of previous games is a bit jarring
    They look kinda goofy in F:NV
        They acted extremely goofy too. 

I remember attempting to cheese the game by shooting at them and then trying to go into the farm settlement near the deathclaw quarry in new Vegas. One of them ran, Usain Bolt style sprinted and opened the door as I entered just to attack me inside.
Yeah, I know others like them, but imo a lot of the old designs were more goofy than intimidating
I prefer the look of F3/NV Ghouls when not feral, but I have to admit once I realized they were covered in tumors I started liking (at least for the ferals) F4’s design a lot more.
I actually prefer the design in 3 and new vegas a lot more, they seem so much scarier. Especially non feral ghouls, I can really see why people would hate them for no reason seeing their flesh rotted and crispy and sloughing off. In 4 they seem too smooth and weirdly have full heads of hair when they have it
If they gave us a game with all these qualities, the loot diversity of NV with GRA installed, hand loading benches, and the karma system from NV, we’d have a perfect Fallout game.

I also wish they’d implement more of a trade economy for “luxury junk” items like old world cigarettes, coffee, jewelry, cleaning supplies, tools, clothes, and children’s toys.

Then they could make it so that each type of item has a demand for certain traders of the wasteland, like one pays you more for cartons of cigarettes because it’s in demand in their area.

Realistically I imagine items such as these will become heavily desired commodities that would fetch a high price.

(I literally make all my money in FO3/NV from scavenging fission batteries and other high-value junk so it would be kinda fun to have to learn where you can sell certain items for higher profit)
    I completely agree. I always found it odd that there was no real use for useful stuff like that other than scrapping it for parts. Abraxo Cleaner would come in handy, but all you can do is scrap it for… fiberglass? And cigarettes should he more valuable than just asbestos and cloth
        Exactly. I’d imagine things like that would be in high demand for more advanced settlements that have ascended Maslow’s Hierarchy, or traders who specialize in luxury goods. Can’t picture every trader in the wasteland selling nothing but guns, ammo, armor, and meds
            At the very least give us a Shady Sam style trader from Oblivion who sells smuggled, even illegal goods, and let us do supply runs for him.
    >I also wish they’d implement more of a trade economy for “luxury junk” items like old world cigarettes, coffee, jewelry, cleaning supplies, tools, clothes, and children’s toys.

This mod does exactly that. And more.

[PLUNDER](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/19377)
        PC went down about a year back unfortunately. I’m hoping Bethesda pulls their head out of the sand and actually implements these things themselves with the next release.

Vanilla runs on FNV can be pretty fun once you get past the general jankiness.

But once I replace my PC, I’ll check it out!
I liked the leather straps, I always thought they were needed to literally hold open their fucked up, mutated mouth so they could properly communicate.
>I put 700 hours into this game because of settlements.

I'm exactly the same, although a lot of credit can go to Kinggath and his team for their incredible Sim Settlements mod
> Supermutant design. No more goofy as shit leather straps in their mouths.

They look like vaguely humanoid pieces of green plastic wrapped in a trash bag. There was a lot of casualties that came along with the cartoonification of the art style but supers got absolutely fucked in the transition.
    “Cartoonification”? There’s nothing cartoony about it. 

And that’s a laughable take, given how supermutants looked before. The new one looks closer to a mutated human than the old design
        The new ones look goofy as hell my man, that's all there is to it. They changed an iconic and unique design into an 8 foot tall green plastic mannequin, removed any personality and style, and wrapped them in garbage bags for clothes. 

Seriously, that's what you prefer?
            Yes, because I disagree with your assessment entirely.

The old version looked like ‘roided up bodybuilders had a baby with spongebob to make them yellow, and then dressed them up in leather BDSM shit. I’ll take “trashbags” over BDSM bullshit any day. And what do you expect supermutants to wear? Designer fashion? They cant wear regular human clothes cuz they’re too big, and they’re not smart enough to make anything nice, so they throw together what they can. You know, like most people in the wasteland already do? Did you forget this is a post-apocalyptic game?

And you can’t seriously tell me the old ones didn’t look goofy with those leather straps over their face holding up their upper lip. That’s such a dumb looking design that makes no sense
                We're just gonna have to agree to disagree on this one buddy. The fo4 mutants are irredeemable.
                    Only thing irredeemable is your taste in art style
                        Cry about it I guess Bethesda boy.
                            I love when kids resort to the “cry about it” response. It’s always entertainingly vapid and says a lot about your lack of an actual argument.
Fusion cores are my only gripe with the power armor design in 4. The excessive power consumption combined with "uwu oh no u shot my exposed powah cowe with a fuckin small calibur pipe peestol imma explode how embawassin" is just absurd to me. Everything else they did with it was absolutely brilliant.
    now i want a pink power armor with an "uwu" written on the torso, it would be the best bos paladin
While I dearly love 4 (it's tied for my favourite with 3), the PA useage thing is something that always got me.

I can understand Nate being able to use PA immediately, he's former military and IIRC served in a unit that used it. So why does Nora know how to use PA straight away? Did Nate bring a suit home to teach her with?

I feel like an opportunity was lost to make the two leads distinctly different characters with the deathclaw encounter. Nora was a lawyer prior to the war, why isn't she able to whip the raiders into a temporary alliance with the MM to fight it? That would be a hell of a spectacle, and shows she is badass in her own way.

As for Nora using PA, why not slightly rework Sturges? Make him a former BoS member under Brandis' team who left to join the MM. The fact that >!he's a synth!< never gets brought up anyway, quietly drop that aspect so he fits, then he can teach Nora after the deathclaw fight.

Dunno, just something that's always irked me. I can get that Nate would teach Nora how to handle guns properly, hell she could have grown up in a household where someone used to take her hunting. But a civvie using PA never sat quite right with me. That's also the same problem I have with the characters from FO76 using PA as well, although I get that that game isn't canon so it doesn't matter as much.

Rant over.
    Honestly, having basic power armor training as standard for all branches of civil service would at least be interesting from a lore perspective, even a PA frame with some kevlar stretched over it would be a decent policing tool.
I agree with NV it's definitely a flip in gameplay after you get the platinum chip, but if you play in the "intended" way it works a bit better. Helping the people in Goodsprings fight off the Powder Gangers, rescuing the deputy from bandits in Primm, meeting the Legion in Nipton, helping the ghouls with their rocket near Novac, then dealing with the hostage situation in Boulder City. 

With that route you see the effect the Courier has on the various groups in the Mojave. You are already working the shift the balances of power based on who you help.
    Ngl i kinda wish the powder gangers had some more time. I get they are introductory villains but, idk, coulda been cool
        There is a lot more to them, but you have to seek it out. You can do some quests with the ones at the prison to get some resources they need, and protect their base against the NCR. The Vault 19 Power Gangers have a questline where they can join the Great Khans
            Wow I never knew this! I’m a big fan of the khans so being able to add to their power base is very intriguing

I’ve usually just eliminated the powder gang in my runs
    True, It took a while for me to even step a foot on the strip
    To a degree, but it’s still a very very sudden flip with no downtime (the parts before this are all about the revenge and what you have to do to get the information you need). It works a little better if Benny escapes, but not by much.
        The Benny “revenge” plot isn’t even a plot- it’s a frame to introduce you to 90% of the relevant factions and companions. You can skip it all and b-line straight to Benny. 

The factions plot line is the Real plot.
I'd say this is because in Fallout New Vegas you can't really separate the story and the setting.

They are one and the same. Fallout 3 and 4 have more traditional stories that are more separate from the open world.

That's why it feels so different in comparison. I think you only find it awkward if you go into it expecting a more traditionally designed game.
"sorry, can't progress the story until you safe this settlement" yeah, no, the pacing was ass.
    4 never made you do anything with the settlements beyond the teleporter mission.
I think that ambiguity of what the world looked like in old Fallouts, especially in 1 and 2 kind of gave the world a cool mysterious feel. Made you really wonder what the Old World was and how it is really old since you don’t even know 100% how it looked like.
    The gothic architecture in some buildings of the classic fallouts always intrigued me, there were some really weird doors in these games.

It surely made me wonder the cultural reasons for a society with such advanced technology to have them.
Agreed. I wish Bethesda would understand this. With 76 and starfield though, I’m worried Bethesda is going to stay on its trend of basic stories and with little to no depth to them. Even though Skyrim is pretty basic at least it’s stories and characters are memorable and cool.
    For me it’s more that you are completely railroaded on the main quest. There are hardly any role playing decisions to make until you get to the Institute
        For sure. I remember in Fallout 3 how you could skip so much of the first half of the game by going straight to Tranquility lanes or how many ways there was to get information from the Irish guy to find your dad.
Damn, even the dialogue wheel?
    It’s different but I have a hard time saying it’s better or worse. It make’s dialogue much quicker and cinematic like mass effect but you also do lose out on some context that you’d have in previous games.
> In F3, and FNV going 10 intellect is simply superior.

Lmao what?
    In both of those games skills are super good to have. Repair, and weapon skill means direct damage, repair, merchantile for money, speech good for many quests, medicine for surviving stuff, etc.. Intellect grants skillpoints each level, and unlike endurance there is no retroactive spending. If you start the game below 10 intellect, then upon first level up you lose that skillpoint. Permanently.
I disagree, to me new vegas handles ambience better, 
The only tension from far harbor is missing a gulper in a tree.
    To me, gulpers is just one of many part of the tension created on The Island. The fog and the constant rads adds a sense of limited time when exploring. Most new enemies are hidden; gulpers in tree, hermit crabs in abandoned cars, fog crawlers within the fog or standing still among trees, anglers by the water. On top of that it's the grand soundscape that builds the ambiance with background music but also has a lot of layered sounds that evokes a sense of not being alone. And on top of that you have stuff like Mother Fog and the visual design of the Nucleus.

I didn't even find those experiences limited to Far Harbor, but had them all over FO4. The Swan really got my heart pumping. Seeing the Deathclaw in between the planks of the museum was among the best gaming moments that year. The car tunnel filled with feral ghouls. Being able to run into sleeping Deathclaws in the Glowing Sea. Finding suits of Power Armour underwater.

That said, I don't think NV is horrible at creating ambiance, it's just worse in my mind compared to FO3 and FO4. Partially because some of the intended ambiance in NV felt incongruous to the story and the setting and just broke my immersion instead of enhancing it. In FO:NV I prefer having the radio on, while in FO4 I rarely listen to the radio cause the standard stuff is so good.
        Honestly the only ambience in 4 that is good is the children of atom theme in far harbor. Compared to [this]( https://youtu.be/YnVynk4hllU?feature=shared) fallout 4’s overall ambience is too little in terms of dread and too much in heroism.
>1. Scrap, Crafting, and Weapon Modularity

>6. Combat

>2. Settlement Building/Homes

These are the big three for me, in that order, though power armor is an honorable mention.
If you have the ability to mod titans of the new west improves power armour for new vegas.
Never really noticed how big of a step up the verticality was until you mentioned it. I don't think Bethesda really had verticality like that in any of their previous games.
    Not at the same level.  There's a few good locations like Vivec city or the area outside Alftand, but they don't use the space as well as downtown F4.
Yeah especially with the perk system. The level up system I like since you don't have to clear enemies just to level up, it's just the perk choosing part that sucks
Plenty of people mentioned settlement building but I agree
You can use iron sights in new vegas. Graphics should be better anyway considering it came out 5 years.
                             Fallout
*A POST NUCLEAR ROLE PLAYING GAME*
Yes! It felt so good. I would often sit and just listen to firefights in the distance cus the sound was so good
    I have a mod installed that alters some sounds to be a tad more realistic and the sound of gun fights in the distance is so satisfying to listen to
        I’ve had some of those too what’s the best one you have heard ?
The next Fallout combat will be incredible. Starfield got a lot of hate for a variety of reasons, but the gunplay and combat is incredibly well done.
This most recent playthrough has made me really appreciate power armored bayonet bashes during ghoul fights. Being able to get one off you then reload is super useful.
    well your name is death corp of krieg so i am not suprised that you find bayonet good.
        Purge the unclean
            For the emperor of mankind and sigmar and tiber septim
This!
Those two things being the same damn button has cost me tens of hours.
I mean I loved those too but omg holding the right bumper to through a grenade and have that a separate thing from my main gun?! It was heaven lol
    Meanwhile I’m over here fucking not even using melee because I keep throwing molotovs when I want to punch lol
        lol I do that by accident too
Yeah but you can still target them so there’s that.
Because they tried so hard not to make fallout 4 in space that they ended up making fallout in space, but worse.
    First it was Oblivion with guns, now it’s Fallout in space. Next is Starfield with _____?
        good writing
    Once they release the modding tools I hope we can go back to Fallout in space. 

First Bethesda game where I feel like mods are a requirement to enjoy the game. Put maybe a dozen hours in it and decided it's not worth it in the current state. 

And it's largely because the inventory, crafting, and building are all exactly that. FO4 but worse. I quit when my inventory became too full for my ship and had to try to build my first outpost.
        The modding tools won't change it much.

People mod when they already love a product. It's a force amplifier.

That's why New Vegas is still getting big mods, people adored it.

I've seen a lot of modders openly say they won't be bothered with Starfield, and I'm not surprised.
            Really depends on what you don’t like about it I guess. The things I didn’t like can absolutely be fixed with mods/ updates. But I also didn’t play very far so it’s possible even fixing those issues I might quit playing. 

I don’t expect it to be this massive thing that rivals Skyrim or New Vegas with years and years of support. I’d settle for it just being less tedious so I can finish a single playthough.
                The Bad companions, bad worldbuilding, bad lore, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad ending... I mean, unless shipbuilding is your thing to a huge degree, there isn't much redeemable about the game.
                    As I said, depends on what you don't like I guess. For you it sounds like that's "everything" and you're right, mods aren't going to fix all that. 

For me it wasn't terrible just mediocre and I can see updates/ mods making it playable for me. I definitely don't expect that to be the case for everyone.
                        Well yeah, that's what I'm saying, the game was fundamentally bad at most things. Fundamentally, it's boring and uninspired, so modders aren't capable of fixing it.
            It’s the #16th most modded game of all time and modding tools aren’t even out yet. Can’t wait for you to eat these words when it’s in the top 5
                I see that as pretty doubtful. Bethesda has a dedicated modding community, people will certainly hop on either way to a degree. Notice the top five are all Bethesda.

But people DO mod games because they enjoy them, and Starfield was... well, shit.

It was probably one of the top 5 biggest disappointments in gaming history, to be honest.
                    *in your opinion

Again, get a fucking grip. You aren’t the arbiter of truth. Art is subjective. I love Starfield. Is my opinion wrong? Fucking no. We both have different opinions. Except I don’t state mine as fact. Downvote me all you want, if you disagree with this you’re either mentally or literally a child.
                        "Art is subjective" is always something people go to when they like shitty art.

You can think New Vegas is a bad video game, for example, or that LOTR: Gollum is the greatest masterpiece in gaming history, but yeah, I'd say you have poor taste in video games. We do have general criteria for art, and for video games, and generally, Starfield fails them.

Bad companions, bad worldbuilding, bad lore, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad ending... I mean, unless shipbuilding is your thing to a huge degree, there isn't much redeemable about the game.
                            New Vegas is probably my favorite game of all time, yet Starfield is in my top 3 games of 2023, and in my top 5 Bethesda games. 

People can like things and still recognize flaws and room for improvement. Starfield was the first game to fully suck me in since Fallout 4. I did 200+ hours on Xbox, and now I have over 70 hours on PC. 

Why do you think all of the things you listed are bad? In my opinion, the main companions were fine, about on par with Fallout 4's, and reintroducing "lesser" followers like Skyrim had was a great touch. "Bad plot" is pretty broad and vague, considering there are  5 different full storylines. The main quest was good but could've been great if there was more to it than just fetch quests. The ending of the main story was good, too. The quest with the final battle against the Hunter and the Emissary was lots of fun and very unique, and the actual ending with the Unity was satisfying enough.The UC Vanguard was genuinely great and probably the best in the game. SysDef/Crimson Fleet, Ryujin, and the Freestar Rangers were all good, but Ryujin and Freestar Rangers definitely suffered from being too short. The lore is good, typical Bethesda quality, but I do agree that the actual world building was very weak.
                            I don’t argue with children or manchildren, which you have now well demonstrated yourself to be. Go drink your sippy cup and eat your dino nuggies
        I sometimes feel like the only person who LOVED Starfield. Absolutely has it fair share of problems, and definitely isn’t my favorite BGS game, but it’s hard for me to hate on it too much. I put 150 hours in within a month of it coming out. It was one of those games where when I wasn’t playing it I was thinking about playing it. 

Give me mods that add more variety to POIs and make them closer together, survival mode to give me a reason to build outposts and keep that mechanic from feeling useless, and I think SF could easily climb up in my rankings in a similar way that Fallout 4 did for me once modders got it.
        >First Bethesda game where I feel like mods are a requirement to enjoy the game.

You obviously didn't play 76 at launch. Lol

It's much better now. But it was pretty lame.
            Alot of us saw the promised and then the timeline= cash grab
            I've tried at least four times to play 76. I hate it. It feels nothing like Fallout to me. I wish I liked it, but I always go back to FO4 or New Vegas.
                It's not for everyone. I'm not a die hard player either. I'll usually play for a month or two. Then wait 6 months to a year and then play for another couple months. That way I have new content to play through each time. I eventually get bored with it and go do something else.
                    What kind of new content do they have? I’ve never played games with ‘seasons’ or that are continually updated. I always see a new promo for different content but don’t understand how to access it. The game always seems the same to me.
                        What's new depends on the last time you played I guess. The seasons are just different themed reward tiers that they have where you earn items like armor and atoms(the currency used to buy premium items). So you don't have to pay much attention to them. 

But they have had several large updates outside the seasons. They added a lot of NPCs and several quest lines for factions like the raiders and the brotherhood of steel. There's actually people to interact with now instead of robots. There are a lot more events, that each offer unique rewards, some tied to factions and some not. These are just in game quests and events that you get for playing the game. No need to "access", it's free if you own the game. You may need to look up how to start each quest line as sometimes they're not obvious, but I have to do that for 4 and NV too. 

There's another large update coming in June I think, where they will expand the map for the first time and add more quest lines. 

I'm not trying to talk it up. Like I said it's not for everyone.  But if you haven't been on in a few years I would give it another shot. It's becoming more like fallout, though it still has a lot of the MMO feel to it.
                            Thanks for the info. I really feel so behind when it comes to this stuff, just got stuck playing RPGs for years and missed out on most of the big MMOs and battle royale games. I hit my late twenties and stopped trying to keep up haha. I’ll probably give it another shot once I get bored with my most recent FO4 play through
                        i think today or yesterday they just added an entire new location and questline. and they add new expeditions and questlines all the time. 

also just various new items to collect from new events and the like
    I would have paid hand over fist for fallout 4 in space
    It's sad, all I wanted was Skyrim / Fallout in space.  Even if we made fun of Bethesda for being predictable, I think it's still what most of us wanted.
    I would have absolutely loved if they just made fallout 4 in space. Shit I'm still playing fallout 4 now, I played Starfield for maybe a month and not really digging it which is a bit sad really.
I've really come around to FO4s system. The only improvement I think would be to have an actual list of everything you're collecting for that automatically un-sesrches components when you have enough for everything you're trying to build.

Too many times have I known I've needed a bunch of steel so picked up hundreds of it only to realise I need nowhere near that much once I get to the work bench.
Everything in Starfield, their previous games did better. The only thing Starfield did better was sucking \*ss.
    The environment looks great. 

Too bad I have to make it a blurry mess with FSR to get any decent performance.
    Yeah, Skyrim had great space combat. 

Get a fuckin grip dude. Starfield is fine.
        Bro tried to say Starfield is fine
        You get a grip, "dude." You're "fine".
I just started starfield today, the crafting is broken
Man, That's why I'm afraid of fallout 5, TES6, the future of Bethesda makes me sad
Idk looking high and low for duct tape and desk fans got boring. Starfield decentivized hoarding, I only collected a handful of things for the sciences I specialized in.
💯 
That’s all I wanted. Well, not all. In fact I wanted a bunch of other things from Starfield too. They all failed. 
Seriously. Scavenging has been a core part of the Fallout universe but it never really became an important part of the gameplay until 4
But folders had no weight it's like caps but with an exchange rate!
Tbf, you force yourself to do that.
Scavenging old world ruins for supplies is far more appropriate for Fallout than the Elder Scrolls.
>go on a glorified junk hunt

No one wants to hear about how you spend your Friday evenings ;)
I’m currently replaying through 3 and I’m enjoying it so much precisely because I’m not constantly looking for a specific type of junk. Also not a fan of the settlement system. IMO I’ve never been able to get into 76 no matter how many times I go back and give it another try because it just takes the direction 4 went to the extreme and without mods to circumvent the minutia it’s just too tedious for me to enjoying playing it.
    3 is worse if you actually want to craft anything, since you need a specific “recipe” of very particular pieces of junk. I much prefer the 4 style “scrap for raw materials” option. 

The one thing I miss from 3’s mechanics is the ability to repair items with duplicate or same type items, outside of a workbench. So much nicer for looting and keeping your guns shipshape!
I’d like to argue that it enhances the world of fallout because now it’s even more incentive to explore
    Story and quests should be your incentive, not searching for more junk. It's supposed to be an RPG, not a post nuclear Minecraft.
        What incentive do I have to explore this raider base in a cave? No quest brings me here, no story is here. Why should I even bother?
            Because story would lead you there? If you want shooting and looting, Fallout is the wrong franchise for you.
                Story ties into quest, dont be obtuse just because you hate an honestly great improvement.
                    Where's the improvement you speak of? BGS abandoned quality storytelling in favor of cheap exploration for junk. Of you want exploration done right by them look at Morrowind. You didn't need any junk for crafting to encourage exploring.
                        Abondaned quality storytelling? Man, didnt know people didn't like the Institute because they're evil assholes, or the Brotherhood because the Brotherhood is overbearing.

Exploration done right? Look at Fallout 4, I can actually be a scavver, scavving in different locations for specific scrap to build and repair things. Or I can just explore those locations when ***STORIES OR QUESTS*** take me to them.

Cry hard my guy, Bethesda added an extra reason to explore places and you just want to be a Bethesda Bad Bro.
                            Dude, what the hell are mumbling about? No matter where you look in F4 it's bad quality writing all over the place.

If you want to have games that just lead you around in search of junk for your next crafting project, take your toys and go somewhere else. Right now your line of argumentation is ridiculous. Bethesda did Interplay dirty, then simply outbid Troika for Fallout, and it's been a downhill ride since then - because of people who act like you. Somebody took a precious museum, then turned it into a cheaply made night club. Then drones like you complain that people who liked the museum dare to say that the museum was done better and had far more value. Sorry to break your fantasy, but people don't dislike Bethesda cause "Bethesda Bad", but because they had two interesting franchises and keep dumbing them down to attract as many casuals as possible to milk them dry.
Does it really though?

And don't say fusion core, because PA has always required a "power pack" in the Lore.
    Well I think it’s the invention of the t-60, though idk if the lore ever said t-51 was the last power armor to be made it was still really odd to add it in such a way, I would’ve preferred if the t-60 was invented by the east coast BOS after the defeat of the east coast enclave. I know people were mad that fusion cores lasted so little because the description of power armor in fallout 1 & 2 was that it’s power pack could power it for over 200 years but considering fallout 4 is 210 years after the war it kind of makes sense a lot of fusion cores are running low. The only other lore complaint of power I’ve seen is seeing X-01 power armor in areas that seem to indicate it’s been there since the pre war era which seems to conflict with what people thought of the X-01 because people believed it was made by the enclave post war.
        Yeah agree with you on the T-60 and the X-01.

Although the T-60 is easier to explain. I always saw it as the T-51 was more widespread and considered the best and the T-60 was more newer and developed very close to when the bombs fell, and wasn't really used that much, like it wasn't as widespread as the T-51 until the brotherhood got it and started Mass producing.

The X-01 is harder to explain.

It can be chocked up to gameplay when finding it in the wild.

Although the one in Nuka World, That is impossible to explain
            > Although the one in Nuka World, That is impossible to explain

Yeah, the Quantum X-01 is a whole can of worms in and of itself.
            Don't you *dare* say anything bad about my precious Nuka T-51!!!
                I was referring to the Quantum X-01
            the x01 is totally explained tho
                How?

It was an Enclave original armor right?
                    if you want i can copy paste my comment ^^"

yes and no, the advanced power armor is the enclave one it is an upgrade of the x01 (wich is just a prototype)
                        Huh. I didn't know that. 

Do you know what terminal entry this is from?
                            from loading screen, fallout 76 whitespring enclave terminal and the fallout bible

ill try to put a transcript :

Fallout 4 loading screens: Power Armor was specially engineered and employed by remnants of the U.S. military after the Great War, and offers increased protection over the older, pre-war models

in the fallout Bible :2198 Enclave works on various new technologies, including Power Armor variations. None of these are much of an improvement over the conventional old school Power Armor, and some are actually worse.
2215 Under Presidential Order, Enclave scientists begin to work on an upgraded version of Power Armor. Many prototypes are developed and tested.
2220 October Enclave scientists develop a reliable version of the Mark II Power Armor. The prototype results (and accidents... and explosions... and deaths) are classified by order of the President Richardson for the sake of morale."

the enclave terminal :

Prototype Power Armor Schematics
--- TRANSFERED TO USER. --- ACCESSING ARCHIVAL ANNOTATION. //////////////////////////////////////////////// Beatherd,

These are the schematics for the experimental suit the members of the Joint Chiefs had been asking after. It's not even close to ready for primetime yet, but it's technically functional, so please get it logged.

I sent a second copy along to the rig, along with the Vertibird schematics. If anything goes wrong with your copy, you're going to have to speak with them.

- Ridgely //////////////////////////////////////////////// --- END ANNOTATION.

if theres more ill update you
        no the x01 isn't the enclave power armor, in terminal, nuka world etc or even about the enclave armor (rn i can't go on the wiki, if you want tomorrow),

the x01 is a prototype power armor.... the enclave taked it and made an upgrade, their own PA the advanced power armor
            Yeah that’s true but even then why is finding it based on level? You can find this rare prototype armor a bit too easily.
                that's a gameplay perspective, imagine if you are high level and find a weak t45? so it is not much about lore because it is just for a gameplay
Outside of Fusion cores the biggest lore retcon is that Power Armor Training is no longer required, but that was itself a lore retcon from Fallout 1 and 2 to fix balancing issues where players would get it too early. Fallout 4 fixed that gameplay problem by making PA require fuel, and as such is able to be more faithful to how PA functioned originally than 3 and New Vegas
For the battery, I just chalk it up to gameplay
It would basically be meaningless to have Fusion Cores in the game if each one lasted for centuries. You’d find one Core and never need any more for pretty much the rest of the game. 
Having them last for a couple minutes is just for game balance. 
    Leakage and sitting in an idling power generator for 210 years will cause issues with power retention.

I also see the Fusion Cores post war like the MK.1 chest Arc Reactor from Iron Man:-

Yinsen - "That could run your heart for fifty lifetimes!"

Tony - "Yeah... or something big for fifteen minutes."

Compared to lighting a building the size of the Concord museum in game, it doesn't really compare.
I actually felt like it was more impactful in the originals because it was a pretty massive power spike. Considering the difficulty of those games it felt like a massive achievement to earn PA. 

For Fallout 4 I never really felt like I needed power armor for anything since the world scales to your level pretty aggressively and the fusion cores made me just not use it even for fun. You also get it way too early as well so it doesn't feel earned imo.
Its better, because it's in the "3d" real
    Better is highly subjective though. I could make an argument that Classic is better as no fusion cores are needed to use the armor
        I kind of agree with you, I think they handing you the power armor 20 minutes in the game   lead to them adding fusion cores and the, in my opinion, stupid armor condition (seriously, why these things even have durability while your everyday armor doesn't?) as balance reasons.

Since in the classic games it was an end game loot, these workarounds weren't necessary, so that's a good point.

However, for me, both the classics and 4 makes you feel very powerful in the power armor, but 4 has an advantage to feel better exactly because of the "3D feel" that was nonexistent in 3 an NV.
            True, but my point is that this gameplay element was already in the series, and a bit better as no condition to repair or use cores but they’re extremely limited
                Right, I was focusing in the 3D aspect because 3 and NV messed this already existing element by making the power armor just be another piece of armor, while 4 took advantage of the gameplay mechanics.
        How is that better? Fusion cores provide a necessary balance and make it more realistic.
            How? I don’t mind Fusion Cores but they shouldn’t be 10-20 mins of use then need more. Technically it’s a retcon as the suits are supposed to last over a hundred years. 

Fallout 4 could be excused as it takes place 210 years after the War, but 76 confirms it as they have FCs and break down but not as quickly as in 4.
NV with 4’s graphics and crafting would be BALLIN
L
    There's currently a mod in the works that converts FO4 into base new vegas, not sure if its going to be keeping the crafting system but the gunplay and graphics will be in the new engine
        Heck, even just having new Vegas with player home customization would be nice.
        That’s never coming out
            Let me dream
The ideal remake would be New Vegas with F4 Graphics and (some) of the content we missed on due to the cuts. Post-game stuff, more legion territory/a new legion companyon, some more options for the independent ending. Hell, if they want to get real crazy they could even add a fifth dlc. Could be cool
    "Could be cool" buddy I'd pay good money for that
This shit. Right here. Put it in an iv drip into my veins. *droooools*
i'm not gonna lie i love the shitty graphics of 3 and nv. it's just what fallout looks like to me
There’s 2 seperate mod teams trying to upgrade Fallout 3 and NV entirely into Fallout 4s engine. I’m sure there’s plenty of mods for those games to make them more like 4 already though
I’m weird in that i’d like some of the gameplay mechanics in Fallout 4 (like crafting and upgrades) but would prefer the movement and gunplay of Fallout NV and 3 lol
    Lack of sprint suuuuuuuuucks. Really need something between “instant fast travel” and “painfully slow jog”.
        I really just like the clunkiness of it. but if it had more features, i’d be all for it, like sprinting or grenade hotkey.
I feel like it technically looks better but sone things suffer. A lot of enemies do look more cartoonish like ghouls and deathclaws. Like graphically they are better, but I prefer the look of them in 3 and NV
I think that the more stylised (or cartoony/plastic) graphics really do help with longevity. Fallout 4 is nine years old at this point but the graphics hold up much better than the more gritty and realistic graphics of the previous two games did at a similar point after their release. Worth thinking about for a game that doesn’t have a yearly release cycle.
Love new Vegas, but the gunplay is probably the worst part.
On the contrary. New Vegas is notoriously poor at that aspect. All the other games laugh at New Vegas behind it's back about that aspect.
Severing a Deathclaw's tail will also make them extremely unbalanced, if I remember right.
One time I shot off a feral ghouls head and it still kept coming at me, the only thing left of its face was it’s jaw but it still kept coming
They look kinda goofy in F:NV
    They acted extremely goofy too. 

I remember attempting to cheese the game by shooting at them and then trying to go into the farm settlement near the deathclaw quarry in new Vegas. One of them ran, Usain Bolt style sprinted and opened the door as I entered just to attack me inside.
I completely agree. I always found it odd that there was no real use for useful stuff like that other than scrapping it for parts. Abraxo Cleaner would come in handy, but all you can do is scrap it for… fiberglass? And cigarettes should he more valuable than just asbestos and cloth
    Exactly. I’d imagine things like that would be in high demand for more advanced settlements that have ascended Maslow’s Hierarchy, or traders who specialize in luxury goods. Can’t picture every trader in the wasteland selling nothing but guns, ammo, armor, and meds
        At the very least give us a Shady Sam style trader from Oblivion who sells smuggled, even illegal goods, and let us do supply runs for him.
>I also wish they’d implement more of a trade economy for “luxury junk” items like old world cigarettes, coffee, jewelry, cleaning supplies, tools, clothes, and children’s toys.

This mod does exactly that. And more.

[PLUNDER](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/19377)
    PC went down about a year back unfortunately. I’m hoping Bethesda pulls their head out of the sand and actually implements these things themselves with the next release.

Vanilla runs on FNV can be pretty fun once you get past the general jankiness.

But once I replace my PC, I’ll check it out!
“Cartoonification”? There’s nothing cartoony about it. 

And that’s a laughable take, given how supermutants looked before. The new one looks closer to a mutated human than the old design
    The new ones look goofy as hell my man, that's all there is to it. They changed an iconic and unique design into an 8 foot tall green plastic mannequin, removed any personality and style, and wrapped them in garbage bags for clothes. 

Seriously, that's what you prefer?
        Yes, because I disagree with your assessment entirely.

The old version looked like ‘roided up bodybuilders had a baby with spongebob to make them yellow, and then dressed them up in leather BDSM shit. I’ll take “trashbags” over BDSM bullshit any day. And what do you expect supermutants to wear? Designer fashion? They cant wear regular human clothes cuz they’re too big, and they’re not smart enough to make anything nice, so they throw together what they can. You know, like most people in the wasteland already do? Did you forget this is a post-apocalyptic game?

And you can’t seriously tell me the old ones didn’t look goofy with those leather straps over their face holding up their upper lip. That’s such a dumb looking design that makes no sense
            We're just gonna have to agree to disagree on this one buddy. The fo4 mutants are irredeemable.
                Only thing irredeemable is your taste in art style
                    Cry about it I guess Bethesda boy.
                        I love when kids resort to the “cry about it” response. It’s always entertainingly vapid and says a lot about your lack of an actual argument.
now i want a pink power armor with an "uwu" written on the torso, it would be the best bos paladin
Honestly, having basic power armor training as standard for all branches of civil service would at least be interesting from a lore perspective, even a PA frame with some kevlar stretched over it would be a decent policing tool.
Ngl i kinda wish the powder gangers had some more time. I get they are introductory villains but, idk, coulda been cool
    There is a lot more to them, but you have to seek it out. You can do some quests with the ones at the prison to get some resources they need, and protect their base against the NCR. The Vault 19 Power Gangers have a questline where they can join the Great Khans
        Wow I never knew this! I’m a big fan of the khans so being able to add to their power base is very intriguing

I’ve usually just eliminated the powder gang in my runs
True, It took a while for me to even step a foot on the strip
To a degree, but it’s still a very very sudden flip with no downtime (the parts before this are all about the revenge and what you have to do to get the information you need). It works a little better if Benny escapes, but not by much.
    The Benny “revenge” plot isn’t even a plot- it’s a frame to introduce you to 90% of the relevant factions and companions. You can skip it all and b-line straight to Benny. 

The factions plot line is the Real plot.
4 never made you do anything with the settlements beyond the teleporter mission.
The gothic architecture in some buildings of the classic fallouts always intrigued me, there were some really weird doors in these games.

It surely made me wonder the cultural reasons for a society with such advanced technology to have them.
For me it’s more that you are completely railroaded on the main quest. There are hardly any role playing decisions to make until you get to the Institute
    For sure. I remember in Fallout 3 how you could skip so much of the first half of the game by going straight to Tranquility lanes or how many ways there was to get information from the Irish guy to find your dad.
It’s different but I have a hard time saying it’s better or worse. It make’s dialogue much quicker and cinematic like mass effect but you also do lose out on some context that you’d have in previous games.
In both of those games skills are super good to have. Repair, and weapon skill means direct damage, repair, merchantile for money, speech good for many quests, medicine for surviving stuff, etc.. Intellect grants skillpoints each level, and unlike endurance there is no retroactive spending. If you start the game below 10 intellect, then upon first level up you lose that skillpoint. Permanently.
To me, gulpers is just one of many part of the tension created on The Island. The fog and the constant rads adds a sense of limited time when exploring. Most new enemies are hidden; gulpers in tree, hermit crabs in abandoned cars, fog crawlers within the fog or standing still among trees, anglers by the water. On top of that it's the grand soundscape that builds the ambiance with background music but also has a lot of layered sounds that evokes a sense of not being alone. And on top of that you have stuff like Mother Fog and the visual design of the Nucleus.

I didn't even find those experiences limited to Far Harbor, but had them all over FO4. The Swan really got my heart pumping. Seeing the Deathclaw in between the planks of the museum was among the best gaming moments that year. The car tunnel filled with feral ghouls. Being able to run into sleeping Deathclaws in the Glowing Sea. Finding suits of Power Armour underwater.

That said, I don't think NV is horrible at creating ambiance, it's just worse in my mind compared to FO3 and FO4. Partially because some of the intended ambiance in NV felt incongruous to the story and the setting and just broke my immersion instead of enhancing it. In FO:NV I prefer having the radio on, while in FO4 I rarely listen to the radio cause the standard stuff is so good.
    Honestly the only ambience in 4 that is good is the children of atom theme in far harbor. Compared to [this]( https://youtu.be/YnVynk4hllU?feature=shared) fallout 4’s overall ambience is too little in terms of dread and too much in heroism.
Not at the same level.  There's a few good locations like Vivec city or the area outside Alftand, but they don't use the space as well as downtown F4.
I have a mod installed that alters some sounds to be a tad more realistic and the sound of gun fights in the distance is so satisfying to listen to
    I’ve had some of those too what’s the best one you have heard ?
well your name is death corp of krieg so i am not suprised that you find bayonet good.
    Purge the unclean
        For the emperor of mankind and sigmar and tiber septim
Meanwhile I’m over here fucking not even using melee because I keep throwing molotovs when I want to punch lol
    lol I do that by accident too
First it was Oblivion with guns, now it’s Fallout in space. Next is Starfield with _____?
    good writing
Once they release the modding tools I hope we can go back to Fallout in space. 

First Bethesda game where I feel like mods are a requirement to enjoy the game. Put maybe a dozen hours in it and decided it's not worth it in the current state. 

And it's largely because the inventory, crafting, and building are all exactly that. FO4 but worse. I quit when my inventory became too full for my ship and had to try to build my first outpost.
    The modding tools won't change it much.

People mod when they already love a product. It's a force amplifier.

That's why New Vegas is still getting big mods, people adored it.

I've seen a lot of modders openly say they won't be bothered with Starfield, and I'm not surprised.
        Really depends on what you don’t like about it I guess. The things I didn’t like can absolutely be fixed with mods/ updates. But I also didn’t play very far so it’s possible even fixing those issues I might quit playing. 

I don’t expect it to be this massive thing that rivals Skyrim or New Vegas with years and years of support. I’d settle for it just being less tedious so I can finish a single playthough.
            The Bad companions, bad worldbuilding, bad lore, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad ending... I mean, unless shipbuilding is your thing to a huge degree, there isn't much redeemable about the game.
                As I said, depends on what you don't like I guess. For you it sounds like that's "everything" and you're right, mods aren't going to fix all that. 

For me it wasn't terrible just mediocre and I can see updates/ mods making it playable for me. I definitely don't expect that to be the case for everyone.
                    Well yeah, that's what I'm saying, the game was fundamentally bad at most things. Fundamentally, it's boring and uninspired, so modders aren't capable of fixing it.
        It’s the #16th most modded game of all time and modding tools aren’t even out yet. Can’t wait for you to eat these words when it’s in the top 5
            I see that as pretty doubtful. Bethesda has a dedicated modding community, people will certainly hop on either way to a degree. Notice the top five are all Bethesda.

But people DO mod games because they enjoy them, and Starfield was... well, shit.

It was probably one of the top 5 biggest disappointments in gaming history, to be honest.
                *in your opinion

Again, get a fucking grip. You aren’t the arbiter of truth. Art is subjective. I love Starfield. Is my opinion wrong? Fucking no. We both have different opinions. Except I don’t state mine as fact. Downvote me all you want, if you disagree with this you’re either mentally or literally a child.
                    "Art is subjective" is always something people go to when they like shitty art.

You can think New Vegas is a bad video game, for example, or that LOTR: Gollum is the greatest masterpiece in gaming history, but yeah, I'd say you have poor taste in video games. We do have general criteria for art, and for video games, and generally, Starfield fails them.

Bad companions, bad worldbuilding, bad lore, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad ending... I mean, unless shipbuilding is your thing to a huge degree, there isn't much redeemable about the game.
                        New Vegas is probably my favorite game of all time, yet Starfield is in my top 3 games of 2023, and in my top 5 Bethesda games. 

People can like things and still recognize flaws and room for improvement. Starfield was the first game to fully suck me in since Fallout 4. I did 200+ hours on Xbox, and now I have over 70 hours on PC. 

Why do you think all of the things you listed are bad? In my opinion, the main companions were fine, about on par with Fallout 4's, and reintroducing "lesser" followers like Skyrim had was a great touch. "Bad plot" is pretty broad and vague, considering there are  5 different full storylines. The main quest was good but could've been great if there was more to it than just fetch quests. The ending of the main story was good, too. The quest with the final battle against the Hunter and the Emissary was lots of fun and very unique, and the actual ending with the Unity was satisfying enough.The UC Vanguard was genuinely great and probably the best in the game. SysDef/Crimson Fleet, Ryujin, and the Freestar Rangers were all good, but Ryujin and Freestar Rangers definitely suffered from being too short. The lore is good, typical Bethesda quality, but I do agree that the actual world building was very weak.
                        I don’t argue with children or manchildren, which you have now well demonstrated yourself to be. Go drink your sippy cup and eat your dino nuggies
    I sometimes feel like the only person who LOVED Starfield. Absolutely has it fair share of problems, and definitely isn’t my favorite BGS game, but it’s hard for me to hate on it too much. I put 150 hours in within a month of it coming out. It was one of those games where when I wasn’t playing it I was thinking about playing it. 

Give me mods that add more variety to POIs and make them closer together, survival mode to give me a reason to build outposts and keep that mechanic from feeling useless, and I think SF could easily climb up in my rankings in a similar way that Fallout 4 did for me once modders got it.
    >First Bethesda game where I feel like mods are a requirement to enjoy the game.

You obviously didn't play 76 at launch. Lol

It's much better now. But it was pretty lame.
        Alot of us saw the promised and then the timeline= cash grab
        I've tried at least four times to play 76. I hate it. It feels nothing like Fallout to me. I wish I liked it, but I always go back to FO4 or New Vegas.
            It's not for everyone. I'm not a die hard player either. I'll usually play for a month or two. Then wait 6 months to a year and then play for another couple months. That way I have new content to play through each time. I eventually get bored with it and go do something else.
                What kind of new content do they have? I’ve never played games with ‘seasons’ or that are continually updated. I always see a new promo for different content but don’t understand how to access it. The game always seems the same to me.
                    What's new depends on the last time you played I guess. The seasons are just different themed reward tiers that they have where you earn items like armor and atoms(the currency used to buy premium items). So you don't have to pay much attention to them. 

But they have had several large updates outside the seasons. They added a lot of NPCs and several quest lines for factions like the raiders and the brotherhood of steel. There's actually people to interact with now instead of robots. There are a lot more events, that each offer unique rewards, some tied to factions and some not. These are just in game quests and events that you get for playing the game. No need to "access", it's free if you own the game. You may need to look up how to start each quest line as sometimes they're not obvious, but I have to do that for 4 and NV too. 

There's another large update coming in June I think, where they will expand the map for the first time and add more quest lines. 

I'm not trying to talk it up. Like I said it's not for everyone.  But if you haven't been on in a few years I would give it another shot. It's becoming more like fallout, though it still has a lot of the MMO feel to it.
                        Thanks for the info. I really feel so behind when it comes to this stuff, just got stuck playing RPGs for years and missed out on most of the big MMOs and battle royale games. I hit my late twenties and stopped trying to keep up haha. I’ll probably give it another shot once I get bored with my most recent FO4 play through
                    i think today or yesterday they just added an entire new location and questline. and they add new expeditions and questlines all the time. 

also just various new items to collect from new events and the like
I would have paid hand over fist for fallout 4 in space
It's sad, all I wanted was Skyrim / Fallout in space.  Even if we made fun of Bethesda for being predictable, I think it's still what most of us wanted.
I would have absolutely loved if they just made fallout 4 in space. Shit I'm still playing fallout 4 now, I played Starfield for maybe a month and not really digging it which is a bit sad really.
The environment looks great. 

Too bad I have to make it a blurry mess with FSR to get any decent performance.
Yeah, Skyrim had great space combat. 

Get a fuckin grip dude. Starfield is fine.
    Bro tried to say Starfield is fine
    You get a grip, "dude." You're "fine".
3 is worse if you actually want to craft anything, since you need a specific “recipe” of very particular pieces of junk. I much prefer the 4 style “scrap for raw materials” option. 

The one thing I miss from 3’s mechanics is the ability to repair items with duplicate or same type items, outside of a workbench. So much nicer for looting and keeping your guns shipshape!
Story and quests should be your incentive, not searching for more junk. It's supposed to be an RPG, not a post nuclear Minecraft.
    What incentive do I have to explore this raider base in a cave? No quest brings me here, no story is here. Why should I even bother?
        Because story would lead you there? If you want shooting and looting, Fallout is the wrong franchise for you.
            Story ties into quest, dont be obtuse just because you hate an honestly great improvement.
                Where's the improvement you speak of? BGS abandoned quality storytelling in favor of cheap exploration for junk. Of you want exploration done right by them look at Morrowind. You didn't need any junk for crafting to encourage exploring.
                    Abondaned quality storytelling? Man, didnt know people didn't like the Institute because they're evil assholes, or the Brotherhood because the Brotherhood is overbearing.

Exploration done right? Look at Fallout 4, I can actually be a scavver, scavving in different locations for specific scrap to build and repair things. Or I can just explore those locations when ***STORIES OR QUESTS*** take me to them.

Cry hard my guy, Bethesda added an extra reason to explore places and you just want to be a Bethesda Bad Bro.
                        Dude, what the hell are mumbling about? No matter where you look in F4 it's bad quality writing all over the place.

If you want to have games that just lead you around in search of junk for your next crafting project, take your toys and go somewhere else. Right now your line of argumentation is ridiculous. Bethesda did Interplay dirty, then simply outbid Troika for Fallout, and it's been a downhill ride since then - because of people who act like you. Somebody took a precious museum, then turned it into a cheaply made night club. Then drones like you complain that people who liked the museum dare to say that the museum was done better and had far more value. Sorry to break your fantasy, but people don't dislike Bethesda cause "Bethesda Bad", but because they had two interesting franchises and keep dumbing them down to attract as many casuals as possible to milk them dry.
Well I think it’s the invention of the t-60, though idk if the lore ever said t-51 was the last power armor to be made it was still really odd to add it in such a way, I would’ve preferred if the t-60 was invented by the east coast BOS after the defeat of the east coast enclave. I know people were mad that fusion cores lasted so little because the description of power armor in fallout 1 & 2 was that it’s power pack could power it for over 200 years but considering fallout 4 is 210 years after the war it kind of makes sense a lot of fusion cores are running low. The only other lore complaint of power I’ve seen is seeing X-01 power armor in areas that seem to indicate it’s been there since the pre war era which seems to conflict with what people thought of the X-01 because people believed it was made by the enclave post war.
    Yeah agree with you on the T-60 and the X-01.

Although the T-60 is easier to explain. I always saw it as the T-51 was more widespread and considered the best and the T-60 was more newer and developed very close to when the bombs fell, and wasn't really used that much, like it wasn't as widespread as the T-51 until the brotherhood got it and started Mass producing.

The X-01 is harder to explain.

It can be chocked up to gameplay when finding it in the wild.

Although the one in Nuka World, That is impossible to explain
        > Although the one in Nuka World, That is impossible to explain

Yeah, the Quantum X-01 is a whole can of worms in and of itself.
        Don't you *dare* say anything bad about my precious Nuka T-51!!!
            I was referring to the Quantum X-01
        the x01 is totally explained tho
            How?

It was an Enclave original armor right?
                if you want i can copy paste my comment ^^"

yes and no, the advanced power armor is the enclave one it is an upgrade of the x01 (wich is just a prototype)
                    Huh. I didn't know that. 

Do you know what terminal entry this is from?
                        from loading screen, fallout 76 whitespring enclave terminal and the fallout bible

ill try to put a transcript :

Fallout 4 loading screens: Power Armor was specially engineered and employed by remnants of the U.S. military after the Great War, and offers increased protection over the older, pre-war models

in the fallout Bible :2198 Enclave works on various new technologies, including Power Armor variations. None of these are much of an improvement over the conventional old school Power Armor, and some are actually worse.
2215 Under Presidential Order, Enclave scientists begin to work on an upgraded version of Power Armor. Many prototypes are developed and tested.
2220 October Enclave scientists develop a reliable version of the Mark II Power Armor. The prototype results (and accidents... and explosions... and deaths) are classified by order of the President Richardson for the sake of morale."

the enclave terminal :

These are the schematics for the experimental suit the members of the Joint Chiefs had been asking after. It's not even close to ready for primetime yet, but it's technically functional, so please get it logged.

I sent a second copy along to the rig, along with the Vertibird schematics. If anything goes wrong with your copy, you're going to have to speak with them.

- Ridgely //////////////////////////////////////////////// --- END ANNOTATION.

if theres more ill update you
    no the x01 isn't the enclave power armor, in terminal, nuka world etc or even about the enclave armor (rn i can't go on the wiki, if you want tomorrow),

the x01 is a prototype power armor.... the enclave taked it and made an upgrade, their own PA the advanced power armor
        Yeah that’s true but even then why is finding it based on level? You can find this rare prototype armor a bit too easily.
            that's a gameplay perspective, imagine if you are high level and find a weak t45? so it is not much about lore because it is just for a gameplay
Leakage and sitting in an idling power generator for 210 years will cause issues with power retention.

I also see the Fusion Cores post war like the MK.1 chest Arc Reactor from Iron Man:-

Yinsen - "That could run your heart for fifty lifetimes!"

Tony - "Yeah... or something big for fifteen minutes."

Compared to lighting a building the size of the Concord museum in game, it doesn't really compare.
Better is highly subjective though. I could make an argument that Classic is better as no fusion cores are needed to use the armor
    I kind of agree with you, I think they handing you the power armor 20 minutes in the game   lead to them adding fusion cores and the, in my opinion, stupid armor condition (seriously, why these things even have durability while your everyday armor doesn't?) as balance reasons.

Since in the classic games it was an end game loot, these workarounds weren't necessary, so that's a good point.

However, for me, both the classics and 4 makes you feel very powerful in the power armor, but 4 has an advantage to feel better exactly because of the "3D feel" that was nonexistent in 3 an NV.
        True, but my point is that this gameplay element was already in the series, and a bit better as no condition to repair or use cores but they’re extremely limited
            Right, I was focusing in the 3D aspect because 3 and NV messed this already existing element by making the power armor just be another piece of armor, while 4 took advantage of the gameplay mechanics.
    How is that better? Fusion cores provide a necessary balance and make it more realistic.
        How? I don’t mind Fusion Cores but they shouldn’t be 10-20 mins of use then need more. Technically it’s a retcon as the suits are supposed to last over a hundred years. 

Fallout 4 could be excused as it takes place 210 years after the War, but 76 confirms it as they have FCs and break down but not as quickly as in 4.
There's currently a mod in the works that converts FO4 into base new vegas, not sure if its going to be keeping the crafting system but the gunplay and graphics will be in the new engine
    Heck, even just having new Vegas with player home customization would be nice.
    That’s never coming out
        Let me dream
"Could be cool" buddy I'd pay good money for that
Lack of sprint suuuuuuuuucks. Really need something between “instant fast travel” and “painfully slow jog”.
    I really just like the clunkiness of it. but if it had more features, i’d be all for it, like sprinting or grenade hotkey.
They acted extremely goofy too. 

I remember attempting to cheese the game by shooting at them and then trying to go into the farm settlement near the deathclaw quarry in new Vegas. One of them ran, Usain Bolt style sprinted and opened the door as I entered just to attack me inside.
Exactly. I’d imagine things like that would be in high demand for more advanced settlements that have ascended Maslow’s Hierarchy, or traders who specialize in luxury goods. Can’t picture every trader in the wasteland selling nothing but guns, ammo, armor, and meds
    At the very least give us a Shady Sam style trader from Oblivion who sells smuggled, even illegal goods, and let us do supply runs for him.
PC went down about a year back unfortunately. I’m hoping Bethesda pulls their head out of the sand and actually implements these things themselves with the next release.

Vanilla runs on FNV can be pretty fun once you get past the general jankiness.

But once I replace my PC, I’ll check it out!
The new ones look goofy as hell my man, that's all there is to it. They changed an iconic and unique design into an 8 foot tall green plastic mannequin, removed any personality and style, and wrapped them in garbage bags for clothes. 

Seriously, that's what you prefer?
    Yes, because I disagree with your assessment entirely.

The old version looked like ‘roided up bodybuilders had a baby with spongebob to make them yellow, and then dressed them up in leather BDSM shit. I’ll take “trashbags” over BDSM bullshit any day. And what do you expect supermutants to wear? Designer fashion? They cant wear regular human clothes cuz they’re too big, and they’re not smart enough to make anything nice, so they throw together what they can. You know, like most people in the wasteland already do? Did you forget this is a post-apocalyptic game?

And you can’t seriously tell me the old ones didn’t look goofy with those leather straps over their face holding up their upper lip. That’s such a dumb looking design that makes no sense
        We're just gonna have to agree to disagree on this one buddy. The fo4 mutants are irredeemable.
            Only thing irredeemable is your taste in art style
                Cry about it I guess Bethesda boy.
                    I love when kids resort to the “cry about it” response. It’s always entertainingly vapid and says a lot about your lack of an actual argument.
There is a lot more to them, but you have to seek it out. You can do some quests with the ones at the prison to get some resources they need, and protect their base against the NCR. The Vault 19 Power Gangers have a questline where they can join the Great Khans
    Wow I never knew this! I’m a big fan of the khans so being able to add to their power base is very intriguing

I’ve usually just eliminated the powder gang in my runs
The Benny “revenge” plot isn’t even a plot- it’s a frame to introduce you to 90% of the relevant factions and companions. You can skip it all and b-line straight to Benny. 

The factions plot line is the Real plot.
For sure. I remember in Fallout 3 how you could skip so much of the first half of the game by going straight to Tranquility lanes or how many ways there was to get information from the Irish guy to find your dad.
Honestly the only ambience in 4 that is good is the children of atom theme in far harbor. Compared to [this]( https://youtu.be/YnVynk4hllU?feature=shared) fallout 4’s overall ambience is too little in terms of dread and too much in heroism.
I’ve had some of those too what’s the best one you have heard ?
Purge the unclean
    For the emperor of mankind and sigmar and tiber septim
lol I do that by accident too
good writing
The modding tools won't change it much.

People mod when they already love a product. It's a force amplifier.

That's why New Vegas is still getting big mods, people adored it.

I've seen a lot of modders openly say they won't be bothered with Starfield, and I'm not surprised.
    Really depends on what you don’t like about it I guess. The things I didn’t like can absolutely be fixed with mods/ updates. But I also didn’t play very far so it’s possible even fixing those issues I might quit playing. 

I don’t expect it to be this massive thing that rivals Skyrim or New Vegas with years and years of support. I’d settle for it just being less tedious so I can finish a single playthough.
        The Bad companions, bad worldbuilding, bad lore, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad ending... I mean, unless shipbuilding is your thing to a huge degree, there isn't much redeemable about the game.
            As I said, depends on what you don't like I guess. For you it sounds like that's "everything" and you're right, mods aren't going to fix all that. 

For me it wasn't terrible just mediocre and I can see updates/ mods making it playable for me. I definitely don't expect that to be the case for everyone.
                Well yeah, that's what I'm saying, the game was fundamentally bad at most things. Fundamentally, it's boring and uninspired, so modders aren't capable of fixing it.
    It’s the #16th most modded game of all time and modding tools aren’t even out yet. Can’t wait for you to eat these words when it’s in the top 5
        I see that as pretty doubtful. Bethesda has a dedicated modding community, people will certainly hop on either way to a degree. Notice the top five are all Bethesda.

But people DO mod games because they enjoy them, and Starfield was... well, shit.

It was probably one of the top 5 biggest disappointments in gaming history, to be honest.
            *in your opinion

Again, get a fucking grip. You aren’t the arbiter of truth. Art is subjective. I love Starfield. Is my opinion wrong? Fucking no. We both have different opinions. Except I don’t state mine as fact. Downvote me all you want, if you disagree with this you’re either mentally or literally a child.
                "Art is subjective" is always something people go to when they like shitty art.

You can think New Vegas is a bad video game, for example, or that LOTR: Gollum is the greatest masterpiece in gaming history, but yeah, I'd say you have poor taste in video games. We do have general criteria for art, and for video games, and generally, Starfield fails them.

Bad companions, bad worldbuilding, bad lore, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad ending... I mean, unless shipbuilding is your thing to a huge degree, there isn't much redeemable about the game.
                    New Vegas is probably my favorite game of all time, yet Starfield is in my top 3 games of 2023, and in my top 5 Bethesda games. 

People can like things and still recognize flaws and room for improvement. Starfield was the first game to fully suck me in since Fallout 4. I did 200+ hours on Xbox, and now I have over 70 hours on PC. 

Why do you think all of the things you listed are bad? In my opinion, the main companions were fine, about on par with Fallout 4's, and reintroducing "lesser" followers like Skyrim had was a great touch. "Bad plot" is pretty broad and vague, considering there are  5 different full storylines. The main quest was good but could've been great if there was more to it than just fetch quests. The ending of the main story was good, too. The quest with the final battle against the Hunter and the Emissary was lots of fun and very unique, and the actual ending with the Unity was satisfying enough.The UC Vanguard was genuinely great and probably the best in the game. SysDef/Crimson Fleet, Ryujin, and the Freestar Rangers were all good, but Ryujin and Freestar Rangers definitely suffered from being too short. The lore is good, typical Bethesda quality, but I do agree that the actual world building was very weak.
                    I don’t argue with children or manchildren, which you have now well demonstrated yourself to be. Go drink your sippy cup and eat your dino nuggies
I sometimes feel like the only person who LOVED Starfield. Absolutely has it fair share of problems, and definitely isn’t my favorite BGS game, but it’s hard for me to hate on it too much. I put 150 hours in within a month of it coming out. It was one of those games where when I wasn’t playing it I was thinking about playing it. 

Give me mods that add more variety to POIs and make them closer together, survival mode to give me a reason to build outposts and keep that mechanic from feeling useless, and I think SF could easily climb up in my rankings in a similar way that Fallout 4 did for me once modders got it.
>First Bethesda game where I feel like mods are a requirement to enjoy the game.

You obviously didn't play 76 at launch. Lol

It's much better now. But it was pretty lame.
    Alot of us saw the promised and then the timeline= cash grab
    I've tried at least four times to play 76. I hate it. It feels nothing like Fallout to me. I wish I liked it, but I always go back to FO4 or New Vegas.
        It's not for everyone. I'm not a die hard player either. I'll usually play for a month or two. Then wait 6 months to a year and then play for another couple months. That way I have new content to play through each time. I eventually get bored with it and go do something else.
            What kind of new content do they have? I’ve never played games with ‘seasons’ or that are continually updated. I always see a new promo for different content but don’t understand how to access it. The game always seems the same to me.
                What's new depends on the last time you played I guess. The seasons are just different themed reward tiers that they have where you earn items like armor and atoms(the currency used to buy premium items). So you don't have to pay much attention to them. 

But they have had several large updates outside the seasons. They added a lot of NPCs and several quest lines for factions like the raiders and the brotherhood of steel. There's actually people to interact with now instead of robots. There are a lot more events, that each offer unique rewards, some tied to factions and some not. These are just in game quests and events that you get for playing the game. No need to "access", it's free if you own the game. You may need to look up how to start each quest line as sometimes they're not obvious, but I have to do that for 4 and NV too. 

There's another large update coming in June I think, where they will expand the map for the first time and add more quest lines. 

I'm not trying to talk it up. Like I said it's not for everyone.  But if you haven't been on in a few years I would give it another shot. It's becoming more like fallout, though it still has a lot of the MMO feel to it.
                    Thanks for the info. I really feel so behind when it comes to this stuff, just got stuck playing RPGs for years and missed out on most of the big MMOs and battle royale games. I hit my late twenties and stopped trying to keep up haha. I’ll probably give it another shot once I get bored with my most recent FO4 play through
                i think today or yesterday they just added an entire new location and questline. and they add new expeditions and questlines all the time. 

also just various new items to collect from new events and the like
Bro tried to say Starfield is fine

Yeah agree with you on the T-60 and the X-01.

            "Art is subjective" is always something people go to when they like shitty art.

You can think New Vegas is a bad video game, for example, or that LOTR: Gollum is the greatest masterpiece in gaming history, but yeah, I'd say you have poor taste in video games. We do have general criteria for art, and for video games, and generally, Starfield fails them.

Bad companions, bad worldbuilding, bad lore, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad ending... I mean, unless shipbuilding is your thing to a huge degree, there isn't much redeemable about the game.
                New Vegas is probably my favorite game of all time, yet Starfield is in my top 3 games of 2023, and in my top 5 Bethesda games. 

People can like things and still recognize flaws and room for improvement. Starfield was the first game to fully suck me in since Fallout 4. I did 200+ hours on Xbox, and now I have over 70 hours on PC. 

Why do you think all of the things you listed are bad? In my opinion, the main companions were fine, about on par with Fallout 4's, and reintroducing "lesser" followers like Skyrim had was a great touch. "Bad plot" is pretty broad and vague, considering there are  5 different full storylines. The main quest was good but could've been great if there was more to it than just fetch quests. The ending of the main story was good, too. The quest with the final battle against the Hunter and the Emissary was lots of fun and very unique, and the actual ending with the Unity was satisfying enough.The UC Vanguard was genuinely great and probably the best in the game. SysDef/Crimson Fleet, Ryujin, and the Freestar Rangers were all good, but Ryujin and Freestar Rangers definitely suffered from being too short. The lore is good, typical Bethesda quality, but I do agree that the actual world building was very weak.
                I don’t argue with children or manchildren, which you have now well demonstrated yourself to be. Go drink your sippy cup and eat your dino nuggies
Alot of us saw the promised and then the timeline= cash grab
I've tried at least four times to play 76. I hate it. It feels nothing like Fallout to me. I wish I liked it, but I always go back to FO4 or New Vegas.
    It's not for everyone. I'm not a die hard player either. I'll usually play for a month or two. Then wait 6 months to a year and then play for another couple months. That way I have new content to play through each time. I eventually get bored with it and go do something else.
        What kind of new content do they have? I’ve never played games with ‘seasons’ or that are continually updated. I always see a new promo for different content but don’t understand how to access it. The game always seems the same to me.
            What's new depends on the last time you played I guess. The seasons are just different themed reward tiers that they have where you earn items like armor and atoms(the currency used to buy premium items). So you don't have to pay much attention to them. 

But they have had several large updates outside the seasons. They added a lot of NPCs and several quest lines for factions like the raiders and the brotherhood of steel. There's actually people to interact with now instead of robots. There are a lot more events, that each offer unique rewards, some tied to factions and some not. These are just in game quests and events that you get for playing the game. No need to "access", it's free if you own the game. You may need to look up how to start each quest line as sometimes they're not obvious, but I have to do that for 4 and NV too. 

There's another large update coming in June I think, where they will expand the map for the first time and add more quest lines. 

I'm not trying to talk it up. Like I said it's not for everyone.  But if you haven't been on in a few years I would give it another shot. It's becoming more like fallout, though it still has a lot of the MMO feel to it.
                Thanks for the info. I really feel so behind when it comes to this stuff, just got stuck playing RPGs for years and missed out on most of the big MMOs and battle royale games. I hit my late twenties and stopped trying to keep up haha. I’ll probably give it another shot once I get bored with my most recent FO4 play through
            i think today or yesterday they just added an entire new location and questline. and they add new expeditions and questlines all the time. 

also just various new items to collect from new events and the like
Because story would lead you there? If you want shooting and looting, Fallout is the wrong franchise for you.
    Story ties into quest, dont be obtuse just because you hate an honestly great improvement.
        Where's the improvement you speak of? BGS abandoned quality storytelling in favor of cheap exploration for junk. Of you want exploration done right by them look at Morrowind. You didn't need any junk for crafting to encourage exploring.
            Abondaned quality storytelling? Man, didnt know people didn't like the Institute because they're evil assholes, or the Brotherhood because the Brotherhood is overbearing.

Exploration done right? Look at Fallout 4, I can actually be a scavver, scavving in different locations for specific scrap to build and repair things. Or I can just explore those locations when ***STORIES OR QUESTS*** take me to them.

Cry hard my guy, Bethesda added an extra reason to explore places and you just want to be a Bethesda Bad Bro.
                Dude, what the hell are mumbling about? No matter where you look in F4 it's bad quality writing all over the place.

If you want to have games that just lead you around in search of junk for your next crafting project, take your toys and go somewhere else. Right now your line of argumentation is ridiculous. Bethesda did Interplay dirty, then simply outbid Troika for Fallout, and it's been a downhill ride since then - because of people who act like you. Somebody took a precious museum, then turned it into a cheaply made night club. Then drones like you complain that people who liked the museum dare to say that the museum was done better and had far more value. Sorry to break your fantasy, but people don't dislike Bethesda cause "Bethesda Bad", but because they had two interesting franchises and keep dumbing them down to attract as many casuals as possible to milk them dry.
> Although the one in Nuka World, That is impossible to explain

Yeah, the Quantum X-01 is a whole can of worms in and of itself.
Don't you *dare* say anything bad about my precious Nuka T-51!!!
    I was referring to the Quantum X-01
the x01 is totally explained tho
    How?

It was an Enclave original armor right?
        if you want i can copy paste my comment ^^"

yes and no, the advanced power armor is the enclave one it is an upgrade of the x01 (wich is just a prototype)
            Huh. I didn't know that. 

Do you know what terminal entry this is from?
                from loading screen, fallout 76 whitespring enclave terminal and the fallout bible

ill try to put a transcript :

Fallout 4 loading screens: Power Armor was specially engineered and employed by remnants of the U.S. military after the Great War, and offers increased protection over the older, pre-war models

in the fallout Bible :2198 Enclave works on various new technologies, including Power Armor variations. None of these are much of an improvement over the conventional old school Power Armor, and some are actually worse.
2215 Under Presidential Order, Enclave scientists begin to work on an upgraded version of Power Armor. Many prototypes are developed and tested.
2220 October Enclave scientists develop a reliable version of the Mark II Power Armor. The prototype results (and accidents... and explosions... and deaths) are classified by order of the President Richardson for the sake of morale."

the enclave terminal :

Prototype Power Armor Schematics
--- TRANSFERED TO USER. --- ACCESSING ARCHIVAL ANNOTATION. //////////////////////////////////////////////// Beatherd,

These are the schematics for the experimental suit the members of the Joint Chiefs had been asking after. It's not even close to ready for primetime yet, but it's technically functional, so please get it logged.

I sent a second copy along to the rig, along with the Vertibird schematics. If anything goes wrong with your copy, you're going to have to speak with them.

- Ridgely //////////////////////////////////////////////// --- END ANNOTATION.

if theres more ill update you
Yeah that’s true but even then why is finding it based on level? You can find this rare prototype armor a bit too easily.
    that's a gameplay perspective, imagine if you are high level and find a weak t45? so it is not much about lore because it is just for a gameplay
True, but my point is that this gameplay element was already in the series, and a bit better as no condition to repair or use cores but they’re extremely limited
    Right, I was focusing in the 3D aspect because 3 and NV messed this already existing element by making the power armor just be another piece of armor, while 4 took advantage of the gameplay mechanics.
How? I don’t mind Fusion Cores but they shouldn’t be 10-20 mins of use then need more. Technically it’s a retcon as the suits are supposed to last over a hundred years. 

Fallout 4 could be excused as it takes place 210 years after the War, but 76 confirms it as they have FCs and break down but not as quickly as in 4.
Let me dream
We're just gonna have to agree to disagree on this one buddy. The fo4 mutants are irredeemable.
    Only thing irredeemable is your taste in art style
        Cry about it I guess Bethesda boy.
            I love when kids resort to the “cry about it” response. It’s always entertainingly vapid and says a lot about your lack of an actual argument.
The Bad companions, bad worldbuilding, bad lore, bad plot, bad gameplay, bad ending... I mean, unless shipbuilding is your thing to a huge degree, there isn't much redeemable about the game.
    As I said, depends on what you don't like I guess. For you it sounds like that's "everything" and you're right, mods aren't going to fix all that. 

For me it wasn't terrible just mediocre and I can see updates/ mods making it playable for me. I definitely don't expect that to be the case for everyone.
        Well yeah, that's what I'm saying, the game was fundamentally bad at most things. Fundamentally, it's boring and uninspired, so modders aren't capable of fixing it.
I see that as pretty doubtful. Bethesda has a dedicated modding community, people will certainly hop on either way to a degree. Notice the top five are all Bethesda.

But people DO mod games because they enjoy them, and Starfield was... well, shit.

It was probably one of the top 5 biggest disappointments in gaming history, to be honest.

If you want to have games that just lead you around in search of junk for your next crafting project, take your toys and go somewhere else. Right now your line of argumentation is ridiculous. Bethesda did Interplay dirty, then simply outbid Troika for Fallout, and it's been a downhill ride since then - because of people who act like you. Somebody took a precious museum, then turned it into a cheaply made night club. Then drones like you complain that people who liked the museum dare to say that the museum was done better and had far more value. Sorry to break your fantasy, but people don't dislike Bethesda cause "Bethesda Bad", but because they had two interesting franchises and keep dumbing them down to attract as many casuals as possible to milk them dry.
Huh. I didn't know that. 

Do you know what terminal entry this is from?
    from loading screen, fallout 76 whitespring enclave terminal and the fallout bible

ill try to put a transcript :

Fallout 4 loading screens: Power Armor was specially engineered and employed by remnants of the U.S. military after the Great War, and offers increased protection over the older, pre-war models

in the fallout Bible :2198 Enclave works on various new technologies, including Power Armor variations. None of these are much of an improvement over the conventional old school Power Armor, and some are actually worse.
2215 Under Presidential Order, Enclave scientists begin to work on an upgraded version of Power Armor. Many prototypes are developed and tested.
2220 October Enclave scientists develop a reliable version of the Mark II Power Armor. The prototype results (and accidents... and explosions... and deaths) are classified by order of the President Richardson for the sake of morale."

the enclave terminal :

Prototype Power Armor Schematics
--- TRANSFERED TO USER. --- ACCESSING ARCHIVAL ANNOTATION. //////////////////////////////////////////////// Beatherd,

These are the schematics for the experimental suit the members of the Joint Chiefs had been asking after. It's not even close to ready for primetime yet, but it's technically functional, so please get it logged.

I sent a second copy along to the rig, along with the Vertibird schematics. If anything goes wrong with your copy, you're going to have to speak with them.

I love when kids resort to the “cry about it” response. It’s always entertainingly vapid and says a lot about your lack of an actual argument.
New Vegas is probably my favorite game of all time, yet Starfield is in my top 3 games of 2023, and in my top 5 Bethesda games. 

People can like things and still recognize flaws and room for improvement. Starfield was the first game to fully suck me in since Fallout 4. I did 200+ hours on Xbox, and now I have over 70 hours on PC. 

Why do you think all of the things you listed are bad? In my opinion, the main companions were fine, about on par with Fallout 4's, and reintroducing "lesser" followers like Skyrim had was a great touch. "Bad plot" is pretty broad and vague, considering there are  5 different full storylines. The main quest was good but could've been great if there was more to it than just fetch quests. The ending of the main story was good, too. The quest with the final battle against the Hunter and the Emissary was lots of fun and very unique, and the actual ending with the Unity was satisfying enough.The UC Vanguard was genuinely great and probably the best in the game. SysDef/Crimson Fleet, Ryujin, and the Freestar Rangers were all good, but Ryujin and Freestar Rangers definitely suffered from being too short. The lore is good, typical Bethesda quality, but I do agree that the actual world building was very weak.
I don’t argue with children or manchildren, which you have now well demonstrated yourself to be. Go drink your sippy cup and eat your dino nuggies
Thanks for the info. I really feel so behind when it comes to this stuff, just got stuck playing RPGs for years and missed out on most of the big MMOs and battle royale games. I hit my late twenties and stopped trying to keep up haha. I’ll probably give it another shot once I get bored with my most recent FO4 play through
