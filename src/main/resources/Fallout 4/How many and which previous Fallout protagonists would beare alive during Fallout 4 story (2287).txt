[[How many and which previous Fallout protagonists would beare alive during Fallout 4 story (2287)]]


Recently I was thinking about that but because I've played only Fo4, I'd like to hear what Fallout loremasters and veterans would have to say


The lone waderer is \~30 by 2287

Courier 6 is anywhere from 30 to 50
    Can't your courier be like a really old man?
        The courier is canonically about 30, and considering the game takes place in 2281, itâ€™s safe to assume heâ€™s only a little bit past his prime
            Is the Courier canonically a hardened general, humanitarian saint, a ruthless legate, or a (mal/ben)evolent dictator?
                Yes
                    Sounds bout right
                Well, poster boy is wearing NCR ranger armor.
                    i believe the poster boy is just an ncr veteran ranger, same as all the past fallout covers have just shown dudes in power armour, mostly BOS but stillâ€¦ just dudes


that being said i agree with you, i believe the cannon ending for the courier in NV is them fighting off the legion alongside the ncr at the second battle of hoover dam
            Doubt the "past his prime" part. Remember the man has a cybernetic heart and spine, granted the og can be put back but there's still some there, and the numerous possible implants offered. I think he'd have to be alot older to be past his prime
                Well yeah, but a cybernetic spine and brain and heart wonâ€™t replace worn kneecaps and soreness from traveling around so much
Heâ€™ll have an excellent back but his legs wonâ€™t be as good as they used to be
                    Now I'm assuming things, but if Courier 6 kept Big Mt's brains alive, figure he could easily have that replaced
                        True true, he has access to the best medical facilityâ€™s in the world
                    Idk how Canon perks are, but can't the Courier have an adimantium skeleton?
The courier and lone wanderer are assured.

The original vault dweller is an assured no.

The chosen one is a maybe (Iâ€™m not familiar on the time gap between 2 and 4).

The 76 protagonist is likely dead, but considering just how mutated you can become, I honestly wouldnâ€™t be shocked if theyâ€™re somehow still alive.
    >The chosen one is a maybe (Iâ€™m not familiar on the time gap between 2 and 4).

Fallout 2 begins in 2241, so it's 46 years before Fallout 4, and the Chosen One is between 16 and 35 when the game begins. It's entirely possible for them to still be alive.
        But don't you meet the guy who plowed the Chosen One's granddaughter?  That the Chosen One's son seems to be the head of the family and is apparently quite old seems to tell me the Chosen One is probably dead by that point.
            The Chosen One's son/head of the bishop family is only 38 when mentioned in New Vegas so the Chosen One is likely still alive (roughly 56-75 at that point).
                Oh.  I figured his daughter was an adult so he had to be in his 50s.
                    I mean at 38 he can easily have a 20 or so year old daughter.
                        Indeed, my dad became a father at 16/17, two children were in their 20-ies before he turned 40.
                            Not to mention its a wasteland so stuff like teen pregnancies are probably more common, and abortions less so
                Wait wut? New lore Iâ€™m learning
            Wasnâ€™t the chosen one canonically a dude, same with the Vault dweller (since they are direct ancestors) and since he impregnated the women and basically carried the tribe from near extinction means he probably got death by snu snu
                Yes, both are canon males.  Vault Dweller was the lawyer preset.
    seeing that 76 takes place 25 years after the bombs did everybody dirty it's impossible for him/her to be alive without some special mutation or serum concocted by MODUS
        Half the perks are also mutations, and there was at one point going to be a cryo bed camp item that wasnâ€™t in the atom shop (and thus almost certainly canon).
            I mean, there is a cryo vault in the game. Whether not not we used it is up for debate, but I dont know why we would.
                Likely not, considering the history of that vault. But you did get the cryo bed from that quest before they changed it last minute due to bugs.
    lets be honest, the PCs are practically invincible demigods so radiation/total armageddon are the ONLY things that could take their lives. Definitely safe to assume that the 76 protag (and other PCs) either ghoulified themselves to keep purifying the wastes or accepted their human mortality and eventually died of old age

I could also see the courier doing this. No way the courier would accept their own death until they are shredded to literal bits.
        With all the mutations a 76 dweller has, Iâ€™d suggest s third option:

They went completely insane, and are now roaming the wastes as an urban myth, consumed by their endless lust for carnage.
            Could be an abomination you have to kill in the later gamesðŸ‘€
Based just off the average human lifespan and assuming nothing weird (any kind of life extending circumstances or untimely deaths), I believe it would be the Lone Wanderer, the Courier, and probably the Chosen One.
    Well yeah the chosen one became Chad nobark
        Also there's a theory Deacon is Lone Wanderer.
            My personal theory on Deacon is that he's Sticky from Little Lamplight. Evidence? no concrete evidence per se but in Companion dialogue it seems McCready and Deacon know each other. Deacon feels most comfortable underground and dislikes being out in the open.
            True, not like heâ€™s Canonically traumatized with PTSD from being a raider and losing him fam(I think) lol
            Deacon could both be no bark and lone wanderer. Didnâ€™t he say he changes his face with surgery a lot?
                I honestly don't even know how much of what he tells you can be believed. Doesn't he also say he's a synth at one point?
    â€¦. 

So weâ€™re just ignoring fact your brain/spine/heart/ are removed at points and you meet a dude whoâ€™s functionally immortal due to his weird power serum?

Because I kinda feel like we should be expecting/assuming a lot of weird shit, given the question.
        Your heart brain and spine are upgraded in new Vegas, so if anything you're more likely to be alive
Easy Pete definitely
Aren't Fallout NV and 3 10 years before 4?  So LW and Courier 6 should definitely still be alive.

LW is what  - 18 in 3?  So probably 28 now?
    Lone Wanderer was 19 in 2277, 29 by 2287.
    Fallout NV is in 2281, FO3 in 2277
Judging off the choices made by the player throughout New vegas, you can essentially become a cyborg through implants and the replacement brain, spine and heart and since the courier is around the age of 30, he could be a bit like the T800 and be old but not obsolete. Oh yeah also Lone wanderer is 30 as well, Chosen one is most likely dead, OG vault dweller definitely is dead, and the resident from 76 probably is dead as well
    Lone Wandererâ€™s actually 19 in 2277 (born 2258). 10 years later, theyâ€™ll be 29, not 30.
Something nobody is considering is that the Fallout 3 protagonist went off to explore the galaxy.  S/He got his/her own mothership.

So probably alive, but possibly a little older than expected because of time dilation.
    older? Shouldn't they be younger if you mean time dilation from moving close to c?
    They would be younger than expected, not older. Travelling close to the speed of light slows down time, not speed it up. 

Your movement through spacetime is *always* at the speed of light. So the faster you move through space, the slower you move through time.
        Oops you're right of course, my bad
The Lone Wanderer, The Sole Survivor, The Courier, and The Chosen One, would all be alive without the occurence of special life ending circumstances, while the original Vault Dweller is most assuredly dead by this point in time.
Fallout 3 protagonist is canonically dead unless he is evil or bought DLC. 

&#x200B;

(I do think they would make "he sacrificed himself to turn on the water purifier" the "official" ending if that ever came up.)
    I think Fallout 4 is based pretty heavily on Broken Steel being canon. The Prydwen is built at Adams AFB from the remains of the Enclave crawler and Liberty Prime is broken from the early fight in the DLC.
        I imagine if a future game ever referenced it that all the DLC would have happened but the original ending would be the real ending. Like they patched it out eventually, but "sacrifice yourself to save the world" seemed like the story they were going for very very hard. (to the point originally that happened even when it made no sense)
            Yeah, I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a reason the BOS couldnâ€™t have gotten the job done without LW.
            I doubt it.  Just like how TES games have it canon that you do the DLCs and then disappear.

Same things seems to have happened to the Lone Wanderer IMHO.  I'm sure they didn't die.  Wasn't there some strategy guide or something that had some epilogue from Moira about the LW?
    I believe it should be the official ending,  it fits the melancholy endings of the first two.
        > it fits the melancholy endings of the first two.

You never played/finished Fallout 2, did you? There's nothing melancholy about destroying the Enclave and building a fancy new city for your rescued tribe and the kidnaped Vault 13 dwellers.
            I think the most melancholy stuff in the F2 ending is just the entropy of most of the unstable cities you visit. Half the towns disappear regardless of the endings selectedâ€¦ though the Shi and the possible Vault City merger are some signs of hope. The rise of NCR and Marcus appearing at Mt Charleston leave me to think theyâ€™re still keeping some of that F2 canon in reserve for F5 or 6 being in the Seattle or Portland areas
    Not quite, once broken steel was released the original ending became non cannon.
    Well regardless of you individually bought the dlc, he is alive as the Broken Steel is the Canon ending whether you like it or not. It can be your personal head canon, but that doesn't make it official canon
Others have gone with the main protagonist/player characters, but if we're talking companions the oldest who may still be alive would presumably be one of the non-human companions (ghouls, super mutants, robots, etc.)
    I wonder what that samurais up toâ€¦?
It takes place 6 years after NV and 10 after 3, so long wanderer and courier are both alive, and no bark Noonan is definitely the chosen one, he could possibly be alive as well.
Raul would probably still be alive since heâ€™s a ghoul but then again that doesnâ€™t make him invincible to bullets, explosives or sharp weapons
Hypothetically, if the Courier chose mr house not only would they be alive, they would almost be definitely guaranteed to come in contact with the institute at some time (at least in my mind.) it makes sense for mr house to try to reach out to them for some kind of deal
    Doesn't seem like the institute has much interest outside of the Commonwealth, other than hunting down synths. Not saying thats a fact because I have no idea, but we know Mr. House has no interest outside of Vegas, and his bots can't get that far if he had to let Victor basically be autonomous to get to good springs
McCready  is the boy who was the leader of the children's town in FO3.
    In FO4 he makes mention to growing up in the Capital Wastes.
The lone Wanderer, the Courier, most characters from Shelter and The chosen one if he picked the cyborg route
If the chosen 1 just came of age in 2240 (when fallout 2 takes place) there's a really good chance they're still alive in the late 2280s at the time of fallout 4.
Technically all of them could be. Whether it's ghoulification or brain jarification, there's multiple ways for the Vault Dweller and all subsequent protagonists to be alive well into the the 23rd century.
Courier and Lone Wardener. Except if the Chosen one and The Vault Dweller managed to become Ghouls which I really doubt it.... 

Lol many people for some reason believe Deacon IS the LW because he knows some stuff about the Capital Wasteland... but that's impossible... Right?
Itâ€™s possible the Chosen One, the Lone Wanderer, and the Courier could be alive based on when those games are set.

My opinion would be that the Lone Wanderer is most likely to be alive. The canon ending makes the Capital Wasteland a better place than when you play Fallout 3, so in theory it should be easier to survive than before. The Super Mutants there are slowly dying out and the Enclave are no longer a threat. The Brotherhood even feels confident moving on to Boston, so we can assume itâ€™s mostly peaceful.

In the West, Iâ€™m not so sure. As the Dust mod for New Vegas shows, itâ€™s kind of implied that the Mojave is facing several large threats that could wipe out most of the people living there. We know the Courier is very strong by the end of their game, like all Fallout protagonists, but the Mojave seems to be getting more dangerous after New Vegas.

Until itâ€™s confirmed by a future game we donâ€™t know for sure however.
    Personally, I'd like to see Enclave again as a threat (or maybe allies) in Fallout 5
The Vaultdweller was born in 2141, so unless he's 146 years or a ghoul he's dead by FO4. 

The Chosen one was born in 23/03/2221 so if he hadn't died by FO4 he would be 65-67 years old, absolutely possible knowing there is older human characters in Fallout. 

I got the age of those two from the fallout Bible and the fallout wiki, the fallout Bible isn't cannon anymore since Bethesda bought fallout, but those games weren't made by Bethesda, so I'll take it as fact. 

The age of The Warrior and The Initiate is unknown or its depending on ingame choices (in Fallout BOS you pick your character from a bunch of characters with different genders and ages).

The Lone Wanderer was born in 13/07/2258, making him 28-29 years by FO4.

The Courier age is unknown, though presumed to be between 20-30. And because the events of New Vegas happened in 2281 he would be the approximately the same age as the Lone Wanderer.
LW is dead, courier is maybe, depending on their actions, and I donâ€™t know anything about the first two
    LW is not guaranteed dead. We know Brokensteel is the Canon ending. Unless something else happened outside of the game after the events to kill him, but I doubt any of those are confirmed. If I'm wrong please link me to sources.
If you think about it, lone wanderer is probs dead. Finding dogmeat alone, them disappearing into the wastes never to be seen again,etc.

Even if the dogmeat you find is possibly one of the originals descendants, finding him alone suggests that at some point dogmeat and the wanderer were separated.

But the truth is we really don't know for sure.
Can't your courier be like a really old man?
    The courier is canonically about 30, and considering the game takes place in 2281, itâ€™s safe to assume heâ€™s only a little bit past his prime

            Yes

            Well, poster boy is wearing NCR ranger armor.
                i believe the poster boy is just an ncr veteran ranger, same as all the past fallout covers have just shown dudes in power armour, mostly BOS but stillâ€¦ just dudes


that being said i agree with you, i believe the cannon ending for the courier in NV is them fighting off the legion alongside the ncr at the second battle of hoover dam

Is the Courier canonically a hardened general, humanitarian saint, a ruthless legate, or a (mal/ben)evolent dictator?
    Yes
        Sounds bout right
    Well, poster boy is wearing NCR ranger armor.
        i believe the poster boy is just an ncr veteran ranger, same as all the past fallout covers have just shown dudes in power armour, mostly BOS but stillâ€¦ just dudes


that being said i agree with you, i believe the cannon ending for the courier in NV is them fighting off the legion alongside the ncr at the second battle of hoover dam
Doubt the "past his prime" part. Remember the man has a cybernetic heart and spine, granted the og can be put back but there's still some there, and the numerous possible implants offered. I think he'd have to be alot older to be past his prime
    Well yeah, but a cybernetic spine and brain and heart wonâ€™t replace worn kneecaps and soreness from traveling around so much
Heâ€™ll have an excellent back but his legs wonâ€™t be as good as they used to be
        Now I'm assuming things, but if Courier 6 kept Big Mt's brains alive, figure he could easily have that replaced
            True true, he has access to the best medical facilityâ€™s in the world
        Idk how Canon perks are, but can't the Courier have an adimantium skeleton?
The Chosen One's son/head of the bishop family is only 38 when mentioned in New Vegas so the Chosen One is likely still alive (roughly 56-75 at that point).
    Oh.  I figured his daughter was an adult so he had to be in his 50s.
        I mean at 38 he can easily have a 20 or so year old daughter.
            Indeed, my dad became a father at 16/17, two children were in their 20-ies before he turned 40.
                Not to mention its a wasteland so stuff like teen pregnancies are probably more common, and abortions less so
    Wait wut? New lore Iâ€™m learning
Wasnâ€™t the chosen one canonically a dude, same with the Vault dweller (since they are direct ancestors) and since he impregnated the women and basically carried the tribe from near extinction means he probably got death by snu snu
    Yes, both are canon males.  Vault Dweller was the lawyer preset.
I mean, there is a cryo vault in the game. Whether not not we used it is up for debate, but I dont know why we would.
    Likely not, considering the history of that vault. But you did get the cryo bed from that quest before they changed it last minute due to bugs.
Could be an abomination you have to kill in the later gamesðŸ‘€
My personal theory on Deacon is that he's Sticky from Little Lamplight. Evidence? no concrete evidence per se but in Companion dialogue it seems McCready and Deacon know each other. Deacon feels most comfortable underground and dislikes being out in the open.
True, not like heâ€™s Canonically traumatized with PTSD from being a raider and losing him fam(I think) lol
Deacon could both be no bark and lone wanderer. Didnâ€™t he say he changes his face with surgery a lot?
    I honestly don't even know how much of what he tells you can be believed. Doesn't he also say he's a synth at one point?
Yeah, I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a reason the BOS couldnâ€™t have gotten the job done without LW.
I doubt it.  Just like how TES games have it canon that you do the DLCs and then disappear.

Same things seems to have happened to the Lone Wanderer IMHO.  I'm sure they didn't die.  Wasn't there some strategy guide or something that had some epilogue from Moira about the LW?
I think the most melancholy stuff in the F2 ending is just the entropy of most of the unstable cities you visit.
