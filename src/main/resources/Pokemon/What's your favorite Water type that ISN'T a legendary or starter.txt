[[What's your favorite Water type that ISN'T a legendary or starter]]


The most common Pokemon type in Pokemon is Water, of which there are 144 Water type Pokemon as of Pokemon Sword and Shield accounting for more than 16% of all Pokemon. As such there are plenty of options for Water types in the games since they need SOMETHING to fill all those lakes, rivers and oceans with. However, even with so many different Water Pokemon to choose from, most people would reply with a starter Pokemon or maybe a legendary though since many people start with the water type and just use the starter as their water type for the whole game. As such, I'm curious what your favorite water type is that ISN'T a legendary or starter Pokemon. (Mine is Milotic which I assume will be mentioned, but I'm curious what other water types people like)


Kingdra and Walrein are cool
    Team Walrein! There are dozens of us!
        DOZENS!
            DOZENZ! (√ó2)
        I'm team Spheal, close enough.
            I would die for spheal
    Was thinking about Kingdra as well and wasn't expecting at all to see people liking it!
    Kingdra is very good.  Great Gen 2 pokemon although rare despite its cool design.
    Kingdra has grown on me every year since Gen 2 was released and I just hated it for wiping me out vs Clair
    Ah, a fellow kingdra truther
I love milotic and lapras
    I adore milotic
        Milotic became my favorite over vaporeon
            hey guys
                Did you know...
                    That in terms of...
            I hate this comment.
        I must have it in every game I play.
    Milotic and magikarp for me, magikarp is too derpy to not love him
Spheal my friend spheal
    Spheal is perfect in every conceivable way
        Especially in shape. Spheal is the perfect shape.
        Spheal with it
    Round boy ‚ù§
        Fuck it he ball
        Round boy indeed ‚ù§Ô∏è
        Shaped like a friend <3
        Careful that thing can learn sheer cold
    I especially love his yellow shirt
        Drawfee! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
        and his big meaty hands
        I was looking for this, haha
    Just got a shiny the other day, my perfect purple boi.
    I was soo happy to see Spheal in PLA!!!!  They just so roll-y and friendly and i caught so many of them just because they're so DAMN CUTE
    I chanced upon a shiny one in Legends! Slapped him into my team immediately, never looked back.
Lapras
    I‚Äôve always found Lapras to be the most Pok√©mon looking Pok√©mon and I love it for that
        It's up there. I still think nidoking rhydon, tyranitar and kanghaskan are all equally the most pokemon looking pokemon. Than lapras is right below them.

Tbf though wasn't lapras like the 3rd pokemon to ever be designed?
            And Rhydon was the first
            Did you start playing at Gen 1? All the Pokemon you listed look like the generic icon you see in the menu
                Yeah that's probably why I think that, they look like the gym statue as well. I started with diamond, it's only really been since gen 6 I've felt like this
        Yes! I know what you mean
        It looks like a legendary imo. Love the design for Lapras
    [removed]
        Magikarp to gyarados probably comes from an old Japanese legend saying that if a carp climbs up a waterfall it becomes a dragon
    I always thought of Lapras as a pseudo-legendary like Dragonite. I know it‚Äôs not but it deserves it.
        Canonical It was, but over the years has been brought back from the brink of extinction
        Truth! Isn't it one of the few that were actually able to commicate with humans, like mewtew?
    *glares in Walrein*

Jk ice-water types for life!
    Lapras
I absolutely love Mantine! 
Next would be Lapras, Lanturn, Seadra, Milotic and Whiscash.
    Yes finally some one that likes Whiscash
        Whiscash gang forever. I will never forget how my Whiscash was the last one standing against Volo and Girantina lmao.
        He has such a friendly face!
    I can‚Äôt believe I had to scroll this far down to see Mantine. Mantine crew represent!
    Since Mantine carried my Elite 4 run in Renegade Platinum Nuzlocke, and being the only pok√©mon able to do what it did, it holds a special place in my heart too <3
    Its lil face is so cuuuute! I love Mantine
    Mantine and Lapras are in my top 5 of all time Pokemon. And the others I'm fond of as well. My name on oooooold forums used to be mantinegirl lmao
Kingdra is just so cool. Too bad it has such a mediocre stat distrubution considering its BST
    Were you around to see it in permanent rain? Thing was unstoppable.
        Rain dance plus swift swim combo is so deadly. üò§
            And that was before fairy type... Gen 5 weather wars were really something else!
    I always thought Golduck was really cool. Especially as a kid it was nice that all the stats were the same since I had no concept of attack vs special attack.
Wimpod and Golisopod
    Yo, a fellow Golisopod line enjoyer! I want to get a whole team of Golisopod and name them all Guzma!
        A full team of emergency exiter sounds funny
    My girls!
    First impression everydays
Vaporeon, and don't even think about commenting what popped into your head
    Hey guys, did you know that in terms of human companionship, Flareon is objectively the most huggable Pokemon? While their maximum temperature is likely too much for most, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along with that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch. But that's not all, they have a very respectable special defense stat of 110, which means that they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. Because of this, if you have a bad day, you can vent to it while hugging it, and it won't mind. It can make itself even more endearing with moves like Charm and Baby Doll Eyes, ensuring that you never have a prolonged bout of depression ever again.

EDIT: This is a lot of upvotes and more awards than I expected, considering I just pasta‚Äôed what I copied
        #wholesome
        You hug Flareon solely for how sorry you feel about it having 130 attack and not being able to properly utilize it for the first 3 gens, finally getting the much needed physical special split in gen4 only to have your only physical STAB being "Fire Fang" while your betters get Fire Blitz, and in later gens, finally getting Fire Blitz but having power creep make you absolutely unusable.
            Flareon got Flare Blitz in the same game where Entei got Sacred Fire
                Being Flareon is suffering, also wasn't Sacred Fire a special move?
                    Nope, it's been physical ever since the physical-special split
        I almost skipped over this because I thought you just commented the original (cursed) thing, and I was pleasantly surprised to read this. Thank you for wholesome facts about Flareon
        This is why I will always adore Flareon and it will be my absolute favorite despite it getting shafted
        I'm sure having a Leafeon would be extremely calming as well. It does actual photosynthesis, so your house would always have fresh air. I also think of Eterna Forest and it's music when I think about Leafeon, because that's where the first ever Mossy stone was. Walking through a quiet forest with one might be relaxing.
        Ngl, if Pok√©mon were real I'd probably have a Flareon just for hugs. Arcanine too, but he'd double as land transport.
    Same.
        Same.
            Same.
    I've got a softspot for all the Eeveelutions, come on Gamefreak, give us the rest, you know you want to.
        I'd kill for a dragon type eeveelution.
            Sword and Shield would‚Äôve been the perfect time to introduce Dragon and Steel. Then Arceus could‚Äôve introduced Rock and Ground with its ancient aesthetic
        The fact that they‚Äôre probably gonna stop making Eeveelutions despite their whole gimmick being one for each type is mildly infuriating.
        At minimum we need Dragon so all the "special" types are covered.
    Same. Vaporeon had always been my favorite and I hate what the internet did to them v.v
    _Did you know..._
        *that in terms of...*
            DONT YOU FUCKING DARE
            *male human and female Pok√©mon...*
                Me: hmm, wonder what they are talking about...

*Googles "vaporeon reddit". First result...*

Me: yup, found it.
                    TIL that r/furrypasta is a thing.

If anyone needs me, I'll be over in r/eyebleach for awhile.
                LEAVE VAPOREON ALONE!
                *breeding, Vaporeon is...*
    Vaporeon 4 life
Dewgong
    Dewgong gang unite! All four of us!
        And my axe!

Really though, loved Dewgong back in the day, and Aurora Beam was so satisfying to use. Yeah, it's not as strong as Ice Beam, but the gen 1 animation for Aurora Beam was surprisingly fire, especially coming off of Dewgong
        Dewgang
    Yes! I freaking love his :3 face!
        I love you guys. You're so cute.
    Yes!!
    And now we are five
    Dewgong was my first lvl 100 Pok√©mon way back in Pok√©mon yellow!
    Happy to see more Dewgong enjoyers in the wild.
    When I commented earlier, Dewgong was nowhere to be seen. Nice to see it climbing up a little, it has such an underrated but gorgeous design.
Octillery
    There he is!
    The OG type coverage of GS.
    Octillery is my guy! One of the most exciting johto mon, an amazing second water type to bear the burden of water hms in rse/oras, AN OCTOPUS, and his move pool is cool is hell! ‚ù§Ô∏è  ü¶ë

E: corrected typos; I got too excited
        Octillery is incredible. It has a nice Shiny, an interesting design premise, and it's so useful in sixth gen. Absolutely my ace, have one in every one of my sixth gen games. And it's so nice to know that a lot of people share the same thoughts! I certainly didn't think so when I scrolled through the comments of this post.
    I also like grapploct as well both are pretty cool
        Yes, Grapploct is awesome, it's just not a water type.
            Which is crap. I remember catching one for the first time and thinking that having a water/fighting type was going to be awesome... I was disappointed
    I love octillery too!
Ill have to agree with Milotic though Lapras, Lanturn, and Araquanid are also really cool
    >araquanid 
 
My favorite water type is the og water/bug type: Surskit. I personally have not seen an araquanid in real life, but I've seen bugs that look vaguely like surskit in california, washington, and  minneosta just chilling in calm bodies of water. Great design for that type combo.  

Lapras for gen 1, and lanturn for gen 2 are great also.
        Surskit full carried me through my first run. Him and the fire chicken and I breezed through.

Young me was lucky, it takes me longer now because I worry about silly things like type coverage and status moves.
            Before getting into competitive: man I love Pokemon

After getting into competitive: spending 30 minutes on route 1 because I refuse to proceed with a Modest Starly
        I love surskit, wish it kept the water/bug combo upon evolving.
Wooper! He's adorable :D
    my absolute favorite out of the 900+ pok√©s!!

 .>>( . ___ . )<<
        Same for me! Idk what it is, I just love woopers adorable face
    Wooper gang!
    Woop woop!!!
    Had to scroll way too far to find the woopy boy squad.
Relicanth. No hesitation. Once Swampert and Mudkip are off the board, this old fish is the easy choice. Really cool design drawn from a fascinating real world parallel.
    \*foists stuffed fossil fish over head\*

YES. There's more than one of us for once!

If I'm being honest though, I'd take relicanth even *with* starters on the table. (Though I do quite leik mudkipz)
        I mean, I love coelacanths, so that plays into the bias, but I also love going into raids with the shiny Relicanth I hunted. I imagine people being baffled about why I brought it in. . . 

Until the hard stone boosted stab rock head recoil-negated head smash does a ton of damage.
            One of the Pokedex entry flat out tells us it's the perfect pokemon because it's never evolved. Even the devs know he's the best.
    
I love Relicanth too. He looks like a cool, living stealth submarine.
    I also unironically like Relicanth. I remember giving out hundreds of the little buggers on wondertrade. Never did get a shiny.
        The shiny hunt for it (I overworld hunted it in Crown Tundra) was hell. I stopped counting, but I was at a couple thousand encounters before it shined. Toughest hunt I‚Äôve had yet - though my current Absol one is going to usurp it soon.
    Had to scroll too far for this. Relicanth holds a special place in my heart.
Kingdra for sure. Competitively I would also add Cloyster (Skill Link) and Azumarill (Huge Power)
    This guy gets it. Love the gimmicks with Azumarill and Cloyster.
    Still have ptsd from when Cloyster became OU, ‚Äòmons a menace lol
    Belly Drum/Aqua Jet Azumarill is a mood
Wailord
    Wailord Gang!
        Beeg boi!
            I love that chonky boi!
    My people! We love a big ole whale.
    real water spout hours
    HP for days

    The happiest sombrero wearing pineapple duck that ever did live!

Although it has the unique Japanese name of Runpappa. 

Run pappa run! The salsa fever will overtake you!
    SALLL-SAAAH
Staryu and Starmie.
    Starmie is such a good Pok√©mon in LG. So easy to get and learns hella good moves via TM
        Starmie is absolutely insane, its a must have in every team I build because she has amazing coverage
            Starmie has been a staple in all my games. My favorite pokemon hands down.
        Surf, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Recover - sweeps through the entire game.
            That's a good set, but with all the poison types in FRLG you might as well throw psychic or psybeam on there instead of either ice beam or thunderbolt. Depending on your other team members.
        Starmie is the sleeper OP pick. It's an amazing sweeper and perfect for regular playthroughs.
        And it's fun to ride on
        What‚Äôs LG?
            LeafGreen
    Mine too. Staryu has been my favorite Pok√©mon since its first appearance in the anime.
        It was the anime that made me a fan of Staryu.  I loved its "hya!" cry.
    Had to scroll too far for this. FeelsBadMan
        For real. Starmie deserves better. Gen 1 all star for me
    HYAH
        HYAH
    Starmie has been my favourite pok√©mon ever since I saw its first card. This was easy for me.
    Starmie is my favorite! Spinning and ‚Äúhya‚Äù it‚Äôs way into my heart since the first anime
    I remember being a kid and always trying to catch starmie never could though
    I can't believe I had to scroll this far to find Starmie! Absolute goat!
Gyarados ofc
    Red Gyarados was my boy in Crystal
    I'm honestly mind blown this isn't the overwhelming majority opinion
        There‚Äôs actually a ton of cool water types
        Because it is a bit stale for most people I assume, like the boring safe answer, like as a Pok√©mon it doesn't end up feeling special
            Whenever I do a replay of Fire Red, it always begins with me saying that I‚Äôm not going to use the same Pok√©mon as I always do. But no matter what I do, Gyarados and Kadabra weasel their way onto my team anyways
                I am physically incapable of not having Kadabra on my team in every pokemon game
                    I don‚Äôt blame you, Kadabra is just so good. Cool design, high special attack, and recovery to make up for the weak defense.
            Yeah, one problem is that seemingly every single pokemon game has made Gyarados accessible early on. It's so strong, so easy to get, and Gamefreak puts it in every game (even when countless others get stiffed until end game). It's a natural choice for its stats, but I have to force myself to not use it because it'd be boring (usually I try and use 100% unique teams every time I play).
            Like a thread asking "Who's the greatest composer of all time?" and answering "Mozart".
            It does feel kinda like that, I agree. But being true to myself and answering the question directly I still say Gyarados everytime.

They might not be that special but they're definitely versatile, at least. Every Gen I play, I use one on my team, never with the same moveset or role but they're always there.
        That might mean that either Gyarados is overrated or everyone is trying to avoid it so as not to seem "basic".
    no matter how hard i try I'm lured to our good noodle
    I still remember in the old days on Pok√©mon Blue, I just couldn‚Äôt figure out why Magikarp even existed until one day from a game manual or something found out it evolves into Gyadrados‚Ä¶ i mean even obtaining a fishing pole felt like uncovering some secret. I didn‚Äôt really believe it but still leveled it up until it actually did. It was such a cool experience as a kid
        
>I didn‚Äôt really believe it but still leveled it up until it actually did. It was such a cool experience as a kid

These things were absolute magic as kids
        I remember buying the team rocket Magikarp in Pokemon Yellow and leveling up like crazy. It was so much higher than any other pokemon on my team. In the Misty gym battle, all my others had fainted and it was down to Magikarp. It somehow flopped its way to victory against both Staryu and Starmie. That was the most memorable pokemon battle I've ever fought.
            Mine as a kid was managing to beat Brock's Onix with my last pokemon, an under levelled Nidoran, because I was just timing those bides perfectly.
        Man your story reminded me of finding the power plant and Zapdos as a kid. Had no idea it existed, felt like finding real life secret treasure.
        I loved goldfish as a kid and was just super stubborn and thought, ‚Äúthis fishy has to learn a good move sometime‚Äù then it evolved and became a badass and I‚Äôve used it in every Gen since lol
    The only correct answer
    Playing silver for the first time and catching the red Gyarados.  So satisfying.  Didn't leave my team.  And hasn't anytime I've replayed S,G, or C.
        God, I remember how I refused to give whatshisnameagain the red gyarados skin as a trade in for the XP-share because I thought I'd be left with a normal gyarados then...

Oh, to be young and stupid again ^ ^
    Gyarados has been my favorite since childhood
        same
        I still remember seeing it‚Äôs evolution for the first time, such a good time.
    Gyarados is easily my second favorite, but Spheal is just perfect
    Magikrap to Gyarados is the most mind blowing power jumps ever
    It's funny how this is probably true for majority but they try to be "original" by not saying gyarados even though it's the ultimate truth

Edit: Lapras and mioltic are other obvious candidates that I spaced
        I was Gen1 kid, and then mostly put Pokemon aside until getting back into via Pokemon Go. Gyrados is absolutely the nostalgia answer, but replaying as an adult I find myself much more drawn to others that I never paid attention to before. Poliwrath, Starmie, and Golduck are all more interesting to me now than Gyrados, not really sure why.
        I thought 90% would say lapras, blastoise is my favourite when gen 1 came out everyone picked charizard and i chose blastoise and loved him ever since.
            Absolutely LOVE Blastoise. Big chonky dog turtle boi with ACTUAL CANNONS for weapons.
    Absolutely
    Straight up the right answer
    Definitely team gyarados. Not even close.

Poliwhirl in a distant second.
    I like Gyarados but it's so good and cool that I feel so mainstream for liking it lol
Quagsire
    objectively correct
    They are just so :)
        He‚Äôs so derpy and I DEEPLY love him for it
            Any Pok√©mon with absolutely nothing behind their eyes is S-tier in my eyes
    Did a water mono type team through Shield.   This dude carried that team hard
        Also one of the only mons that could beat Zacian before it was banned in competitive singles. Truly the god slayer
        That's nothing, try it in Colosseum and see how hard it carries there.
    Aquire the sire
        [He has been acquired](https://youtu.be/buc64u6Q_oA)
    Quag is shaped like a friend
    Correct.
    They are the best bois
    My boy is still relevant in competitive as a wall, he has a great ability called Unaware that ignores stat changes so you can switch him into a set up sweeper with no problem
Probably Clawitzer!
    This guy gets it, Clawitzer W
    Clawitzer gang
    GO CLAWITZER!!!
LIVING WATER CANNON FOR THE WIN!
    Choice Specs Clawitzer with Mega Launcher boosted Aura Spheres, Dark Pulses and Terrain Pulses is so much fun
        Since Clawitzer is in the PaldeaDex, you should try Terastallizing one into a Fighting-type and fire off an Aura Sphere at ~~an innocent civilian~~ a Ferrothorn
    üëë
    Absolute W
    I am sad I had to scroll so far to find one of the crab boys :0

Clawitzer is mx favorit, followed by Kingler...Dwebble ties with them, though it ain't water type
    Claw our way to the top boys!
I have always loved Kingler!
    I've always wanted an all crab team. I hope the rest of the crabs make it into Scarlet and Violet so I can finally live the dream.
        ü¶Ä Crab people! Crab People! ü¶Ä
            Taste like crab, talk like people
            ü¶Äü¶Ä Game Freak won't respond to this thread ü¶Äü¶Ä
        100% my thoughts when I saw Klawf.
    Cookie cookie
    A Kingler just recently ended up being one of my two battlers in my Shield playthrough. That thing hits like a truck. I even went ahead and gave it GMax.
    Kingler is such an underrated Pok√©mon in general. Not my favorite water type but top 5 easily.
    Yeah I don‚Äôt know why I like kingler so much, but I do
    Kingler gang!!!
    I rewatched Pokemon season 1, and some of the Krabby jokes are hilarious in that season. First Gary‚Äôs Krabby is much bigger, then Ash catches Professor Oak almost cooking his Krabby into a soup. Poor Krabby!
Tentacruel
    My very first shiny! Also as a kid I was convinced that he is a legendary god by that one pokemon episode where the tentacools attack a city
        I am so disappointed by Tentacruel‚Äôs power level in the games!
    One of my favourites, period. 

I love how underestimated it is, due to being a random encounter pest. Sure, Golbat couldn't do much, but Tentacruel was an absolute beast, even more so back when Special was just one stat.
Lumineon is legit terrible to use, trust me I‚Äôve tried, but I just love it‚Äôs design so much. It‚Äôs simple yet elegant.
    I love Lumineon‚Äôs design, too!
Lanturn
    Can I upvote more than once? 

Honourable mention to Chinchou too. Named my Lanturn Chimchow in honour of my dyslexic childhood self.

And yes, I was the kid who pronounced Kyogre as "Kai-ro-juh"
        As a kid I was actually disappointed by Chinchou evolving into Lanturn.

Now there's nothing wrong with Lanturn, it's a cool pokemon, but as a kid I was hoping for a continuation of the angler fish vibe than a dolphin.
            ... am I remembering everything wrong or isn't Lanturn an angler fish?
                I called it a dolphin but the tail is definitely still fish-like.

So it has all the elements of an angler fish with the tail and the lure but it's too...friendly?
                    Dude, you may think and feel that chinchou is your friend but trust me, he isn‚Äôt.
                It‚Äôs like a cuddly friendly anime lantern fish
    I remember using Lanturn for the first time in silver. I found it super cool to have a Pokemon with "contradictory" dual typing.
    Saaaaame. Love my squishy Lamp Boy.
    lanturn is awesome, soak + electricity is fun
        Super effective STAB everyone!
I‚Äôm torn between two; Araquanid and Barraskewda. I‚Äôve loved the former since my first playthrough of Sun and almost every aspect of it I really like, be-it ability, typing, design or Pok√©dex lore. The latter is a much more recent addition, since I only came to appreciate it earlier this month when it almost singlehandedly took me to the top of the singles Battle Tower. I prefer the stats and moves of Barraskewda but prefer the typing, design and ability of Araquanid. It‚Äôs a tough call but one of those two for sure
C...corsola...
    Username doesn't check out, but I second Corsola
    I can‚Äôt believe I had to scroll so far! Corsola was my first ever shiny hunt because of how cool it is. I‚Äôm o
    IM NOT THE ONLY ONE.

IVE ALWAYS LOVED CORSOLA
WishiWashi. Love it's whole school gimmick and it looks adorable
    Severely underrated Pokemon, this thing is such a beast. And the solo form is such a cute little fish stick!
        Came on to say exactly this. Players underestimate it because it has an obvious weakness, but until it drops under 25% health it's stats rival Kyogre! Unbelievable for a non-legendary Pok√©mon, and with the right support its one of the strongest water types you could ever ask for
        > this thing is such a beast

Its very low speed and HP are really its Achilles heel, though. Especially since really only 75% of that HP is usable due to its ability.

It's an absolute beast in the mid game when you're often up against opponents that aren't fully evolved yet ... but by the end of the game when you're up against tougher opponents, Wishiwashi really starts to lag behind, becoming quite vulnerable to taking hits due to that low speed ... and not being able to tank very many hits because of the low HP.
            Its low speed is rather unfortunate, I'll give you that. I've found the HP to be manageable though, since School Form's defense and special defense are very high and it can learn Aqua Ring for recovery. It's more than usable in the late game in my opinion, and it's always a fun Pokemon to play with. You are absolutely right that mid-game is its biggest strong point though, thing is an absolute unit at that point in the game
                Yeah... In my experience, Wishiwashi goes from absolutely carrying my team in the mid game to being my team's weakest link in the late game.
    Incredible name, form gimmick, lore, half amazing shiny. What more do you want
    And it has just a banger name.
1) Gyarados

2) Gastrodon

3) Vaporeon

4) Milotic 

5) Buizel
    Buizel the best!
        Yes!
    Gastrodon is really underappreciated, it's my second favorite ground type
Sharpedo cuz it was my first ever shiny, even before I ever played a Johto game with the red Gyarados
    Daggum, sharpedo is way too far down. Gimme dat speed boost!
        My speedy torpedo boy that looks cuddly - and my theory is if he has speed boost rather than rough skin, he actually is!
Basculegion! but the red one.
Jellicent
    Jellicent 100%, its such a good design
    I am so glad I kept scrolling, definite agreement here
    Jellicent is the best
    Pringles jellyfish
Slowking is my all-time favourite! Kingdra, Milotic, Wailord and Lapras are pretty cool too.
    Slowking gang
        My brethren
shellos and gastrodon are my favorites of all time
    My Gastrodon carried me through legends Arceus - and it having storm drain in the main series makes it super useful.
        Gastrodon carried me through Brilliant Diamond it's so good
    I love them so much. So happy, aloof, and chill. Gastrodon knows his shit but doesn't feel like he has to prove it to anyone. He doesn't clamor for the spotlight because he knows you'll come back to him anyway, and he won't try to make you feel guilty about your brief stint with Swampert. He'll just say how awesome it is to see you again and ask if you want to go to that ice cream stand you love so much. He doesn't just accept, but loves you for who you are in ways no one on tinder will ever match. He's so perfect that no one can judge him for having an anxiety attack whenever he tries to mow the lawn. Gastrodon is a friend for life.
    Person of culture, I see
    scrolled too far for this answer
Probably Buizel!
    He has high speed because he‚Äôs a buizy boy and has to rush everywhere
    Super cute. Really appealing and unique colour scheme for a Water type. Oozes personality. What's not to love?
    I love the design of Buizel and Floatzel. Plus who doesn't love otters? If I had to choose one just for fun, it would be them.

For a more competitive team, probably Vaporeon, Lapras, or Milotic.
    I think it's kind of funny that everyone loves Buizel but no one seems to care about its evolution, Floatzel.
        I love them both!
    The correct answer <3
    Yes! He's underrated
Politoed
    I have a shiny Politoed named gummy!
        I have found our banner. I am home.
    Loving Politoed even before it got Drizzle.
    I've loved politoed for a long time, and I'm kinda sad I've never actually been able to use one in any of the games.
        I did a whole run in gold with just a politoed, worth it
    THANK YOU, A PERSON OF CULTURE
Slowbro!
    i had to scroll too far to find this
    Slowbro is my favorite mon. Look at him he‚Äôs a dumb pink hippo.
    Slowfam my beloved ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Slowpoke and Slowbro are my favorite water-types by far, and I even have a mold fondness for Slowking.
    I think of Slowbro as a Psychic type so I forgot about him
Golduck
    Same, the first pokemon episode with them in it. Goldduck kicked some ass. They could really use that Psychic sub type though.
    Let's go duck gang. Always loved goldduck since gen 1
    Love golduck, candidate for coolest Pok√©mon
        He deserves to ate least on the top 10
    Had to scroll way too far to see this. I guess that's why he didn't get the gen 1 buffs that some others did.
        Same I scroll all the way down here looking for my people!
Pyukumuku
    No legendary Mons, this one PYUKS all over OU since Ferrothorn got banned for being disgustingly homophobic
        What r/stunfisk does to a mf
            How did r/stunfisk affect the fan base meta?
    u/MudkipNerd I found you a friend
Marill is cool.
    Knew I'd find this answer here, just surprised it wasn't higher
Poliwrath could of been a starter himself. Best water type. Fight me
    He was Red‚Äôs starter :)
        I did a poll on here once. Most people associate Pikachu or Charizard with Red. Poliwrath came a distant third, ahead of Venusaur. We know that Poliwrath is the right answer, though.
            Poliwrath is really just for manga red though right? Game red never uses the poli line afaik.
                Yeah but manga Red is best Red :P
            Poliwhirl evolving is one of my favourite moments in the manga. I like using Red‚Äôs manga team sometimes when I play through Kanto.
    You are absolutely right.
No one can or will fight you.
    Poliwrath my beloved ü•∞
    Poliwrath gang rise up
    Poliwrath isn't bad but I love Poliwhirl so much I never want to evolve him. Politoed is great too but same problem.
    Damn I had to scroll so far for the correct answer!
    How is this so low? Always my water choice in red.
    I always nickname them Gloves
floatzel has a funny little cry i enjoy
    Orange otter with floaties best boi
    Was looking for someone else who likes Floatzel. Way too far down!
1. Vaporeon
2. Wooper
3. Lotad
4. Golisopod
    I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for lotad
    Golisopod is such a cool pokemon
    >1. Vaporeon

Heh.
        *oh no*
            #[OH YEAH!](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CHUuujSW8AAVZTg.jpg)
        Why not Vaporeon?
            Don‚Äôt ask, stay uninformed.
            You don't want to know
                Kinda getting the vibe that there‚Äôs a massive market for Vaporeon furry porn that I don‚Äôt want to find.
                    While I'm sure there's plenty, I'd wager it's more about the copypasta.
                    Rule 34
            https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vaporeon
                Okay my suspiscions have been confirmed
                    Im sorry lol
            HEY GUYS, DID YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF‚Ä¶
Crawdaunt. Lobed my angy crusty boi since Hoenn.
Golisopod! I love the dude. Second is probably Toxapex
Seismotoad. Love that bubbly frog man so much. He‚Äôs one of the only gen 5 Pok√©mon I actually like so I gravitated to him when I played those games.
    I thought more people would share your opinion, but I'm with you on this one. I know it's blasphemy, but I always felt like Seismitoad is cooler version of Poliwrath (which I also love and would probably be number 2)
    I used a Seismitoad in White and it‚Äôs awesome!
Vaporeon, Azumarill, Lapras
    Vaporeon, let‚Äôs go
Toxapex! It's one of my all time favs. I love my shiny one as it's my favorite colors.
    Not a fan of the shiny, but had to scroll too far to find my answer.
        Haha! I don't blame you as I know a lot of people tend to not like Pink and Yellow let alone the two combined xD it's the same reason I love Ferrothorn...well one of the reasons.
Lapras, Dewgong, Slowking, Vaporeon, Milotic, Gyarados, Poliwrath, Kingdra, Crawdaunt, and Lanturn are all some I'm quite fond of.
Whiscash
    I had to scroll way too far to find my boy Whiscash.
        How sad, whiscash is best fish, he should be up higher
    It just looks so happy
Marill and Azumarill
Cloyster with skill link. The orange shiny is something I've been chasing for a while now :( recently got a Japanese ditto so I'm going to try mesuda method and breed for one.
    Orange shiny? Isn't Cloyser navy blue in its shiny?
        Yes. I believe shellder is orange shiny tho
        Yes i misspoke
    I feel like I had to scroll way too far to find my man, Cloyster. He‚Äôs the best!
        Lol I slept on him like everyone else and eventually did a run with pokemom I never used. Found a new favorite doing so!
    My main competitive Pokemon over the years is my Skill Link Cloyster, yeah.
Swanna
Dracovish
Cramorant
    I love a lot of water types. And he is right at the top. I love his dumb face.
Lapras

Wishiwashi

Agree on Milo
Walrein. I relate to it far too much.

Overweight. Not as cute as back when I was a baby (Spheal). Slow as hell. Always 2nd place in the eyes of most (Lapras), but still the best no matter what. Walrus gang.
Magikarp, Milotic, Lapras, Kingler, Psyduck
    All great choices. Magikarp is awesome even without evolving.
Slowpoke 100000%
Corfish idk why I just like it and I can't say greninja or blastoise
    It's a shame I needed to scroll so far to find this. Corfish is so awesome.
Gastrodon! Also Golisopod and Lanturn are pretty cool. I might get eviscerated but I don't hate Simipour either. 1000% better than the rest of the elemental monkeys.
Unpopular opinion: I just love the Lumineon line.
    FINALLY SOMEONE ITS SO GOOD THEY GLOW PRETTY
[removed]
    Yeah, obviously Feebas.
Kingler is for me the best that sharpedo than gyrados
Pelipper and Bibaral

Now I know what you're thinking those are probably some of the lamest water type pok√©mon that exist, BUT both of them have such a diverse move pool that allows them to be amazing HM learners and thus lets the rest of your team free to do whatever they want to do
    Based bibarel appreciator
    Pelipper is a good bird! Only the best for Pellies!
    Pelipper with Drizzel/Hydro Pump/Hurricane hits like a truck with insane coverage.
West Sea Gastrodon


I know East Sea is more popular, but I think it rocks the pink and brown
    I love West sea gastrodon!
Mareanie
Kingdra and Starmie
Milotic is my choice but Poliwrath is such a close second
Psyduck.

I kinda hate its final evolution, but I find it to be a really cute and funny design.
As a marine biologist, I have a lot. However, really enjoy clamperl.
Lumineon and I am tired to pretend it's not.
Everyone forgets Gorebyss and Huntail):
Lapras
Tentacruel.  I put one on an attempt at a competitive team.  The team was terrible, but I fell in love with my tentacruel.
    Hell yeah, dude! Let‚Äôs hang out down here at the bottom of the thread where only the cool kids will find us. Tentacruel is life.
Clawitzer, Gyarados (especially a shiny one), and Wooper
Basculin. It looks cool as hell and Basculegion was the perfect evolution.
Gen I¬†¬† : Poliwhirl

Gen II¬† : Mantine

Gen III : Milotic

Gen IV : Gastrodon

Gen V¬† : Swanna

Gen VI : Clawitzer

Gen VII¬† : Wishiwashi

Gen VIII : Dracovish
Clawitzer, araquanid, and masquerain are all favorites for me in terms of design but idk if they are good competitively
    Masquerain is bug/flying
    Design is more important than if they're good or not competitively in my opinion lol
    Araquanid is incredible on mono big teams,not sure about others though
Kingler
Poliwrath
I've always liked vaporeon
Wailord!
Magikarp once they get tackle
    So level 15 Magikarp
Milotic
Probably either the omanyte line or the tentacool line
Buizel. Love that lil dude
Milotic
Toxapex
I bounce between Kingler and Quaqsire
Mine is Mantine.
Horsea!
Water types are so awesome in general.. so many options.. i dont know one precise awnser honestly:

Lapras, Kingdra, Golisopod, Azumarill,..
Lapras, Azumarill, Gastrodon
Skurskit

I love that little guy.
Politoed 1000% best water. Mono water cute as a button
I like Golisopod, Barbaracle, Starmie, and Clawitzer
Buizel. He‚Äôs an otter with water wings!
100% Buizel, but I would never evolve him. Sorry Floatzel, you're lame
I would say I‚Äôm suprised that nobody has said Bibarel, but then I remembered that OP said no legendaries.

In any case, my favorite non-starter or non-legend Pok√©mon would be a tie between Gyarados and Golisopod. Gyarados because I‚Äôve used it on a few teams and found it to be pretty useful, and Golisopod because I think it‚Äôs design is really cool and I‚Äôd love to use one (Side note: I‚Äôm surprised Golisopod isn‚Äôt part steel)
Starmie is a fucking beast. If I can ever get a chance to use one in any game I‚Äôm using it.
I'm amazed nobody has mentioned the fossil bois Kabutops and Omastar.

I'm more of a Kabutops fan but Relicanth deserves a mention.
My baby boy Ludicolo, how can you not love that happy pineapple (or I guess colocynth as his namesake but whatever)
    I love Ludicolo so much. Just a happy little guy with some sick dance moves
It's either Araquanid or Swanna for me, both have designs that just appeal a lot to me
Horsea, Lapras, Marill and Corsola.
Buizel and golduck
Milotic

Slow poke

Corphish

Sharpedo

Lapras
Mantyke
Spheal line and Seaking
GOLISOPOD
Golisopod. He just looks awesome.
Corsola. I have fond memories of catching one in silver 20 years ago and that little coral boi was my ace somehow through the elite 4.
I did always have a soft spot for carracosta

Just a turtle in an assault vest
Cloyster is pretty cool (heh)
Cloyster
octillery babey!!!
Omastar
i love the lotad line. they all look so goofy and i appreciate it
Gastrodon is BABY.
Politoad.
I‚Äôm going to be judged HEAVILY for this‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs Vaporeon. I swear it‚Äôs not like *that*‚Ä¶
Lapras especially gigantimax
Staryu and Starmie
Barraskewda and Clawitzer
Imma get some hate for this one but I‚Äôve Always been quite fond of seismitoad‚Ä¶.
Milotic
Lanturn, or Lapras for me although Sharpedo is also up there
Vaporeon (say anything sus and I will block you), Milotic, and the Spheal line.
Milotic, it's pretty and tanky :]
Milotic. It's elegant and cool looking at the same type. I just wish it wasn't a pain in the ass to get in most games. I was really sad when they made it a trade evolution upon scrapping contests. I hate having to trade a pokemon to evolve it.
Pan pour
Shout out to the best Pokemon. Alolomomolo! Keeping it real 1963!!!
Omanyte and Omastar
Surskit. I'll never forgive gamefreak for getting rid of it's water typing on evolution!
Kabutops. Has been a favourite of mine since gen 1 and continues to be. Something about his design just stands out as bad ass to me
Starmie
Starmie is one of my fave water types. Such a simple yet cool design and it‚Äôs cry is amazing imo
Starmi and Staryu üòá‚≠êÔ∏èüåüüí¶
I don‚Äô t give a shit what anyone says, Kabutops is goated
Kabutops always
I find the lack of kabutops disturbing. There's something about a horseshoe crab of death that I find cool as heck.
Wailmer is my boi
Kabutops!
Golisopod is just sick af
Kabutops.
Bro golisopod HAS to be up there as a coolest water type.
Kabutops or Basculegion! Honorable mention to Clawitzer though, the shiny is super cool.
Tirtouga and Carracosta! Big fan of both
Kabutops
Kabutops.
Team Walrein! There are dozens of us!
    DOZENS!
        DOZENZ! (√ó2)
    I'm team Spheal, close enough.
        I would die for spheal
Was thinking about Kingdra as well and wasn't expecting at all to see people liking it!
Kingdra is very good.  Great Gen 2 pokemon although rare despite its cool design.
Kingdra has grown on me every year since Gen 2 was released and I just hated it for wiping me out vs Clair
Ah, a fellow kingdra truther
I adore milotic
    Milotic became my favorite over vaporeon
        hey guys
            Did you know...
                That in terms of...
        I hate this comment.
    I must have it in every game I play.
Milotic and magikarp for me, magikarp is too derpy to not love him
Spheal is perfect in every conceivable way
    Especially in shape. Spheal is the perfect shape.
    Spheal with it
Round boy ‚ù§
    Fuck it he ball
    Round boy indeed ‚ù§Ô∏è
    Shaped like a friend <3
    Careful that thing can learn sheer cold
I especially love his yellow shirt
    Drawfee! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
    and his big meaty hands
    I was looking for this, haha
Just got a shiny the other day, my perfect purple boi.
I was soo happy to see Spheal in PLA!!!!  They just so roll-y and friendly and i caught so many of them just because they're so DAMN CUTE
I chanced upon a shiny one in Legends! Slapped him into my team immediately, never looked back.
I‚Äôve always found Lapras to be the most Pok√©mon looking Pok√©mon and I love it for that
    It's up there. I still think nidoking rhydon, tyranitar and kanghaskan are all equally the most pokemon looking pokemon. Than lapras is right below them.

Tbf though wasn't lapras like the 3rd pokemon to ever be designed?
        And Rhydon was the first
        Did you start playing at Gen 1? All the Pokemon you listed look like the generic icon you see in the menu
            Yeah that's probably why I think that, they look like the gym statue as well. I started with diamond, it's only really been since gen 6 I've felt like this
    Yes! I know what you mean
    It looks like a legendary imo. Love the design for Lapras
[removed]
    Magikarp to gyarados probably comes from an old Japanese legend saying that if a carp climbs up a waterfall it becomes a dragon
I always thought of Lapras as a pseudo-legendary like Dragonite. I know it‚Äôs not but it deserves it.
    Canonical It was, but over the years has been brought back from the brink of extinction
    Truth! Isn't it one of the few that were actually able to commicate with humans, like mewtew?
*glares in Walrein*

Jk ice-water types for life!
Lapras
Yes finally some one that likes Whiscash
    Whiscash gang forever. I will never forget how my Whiscash was the last one standing against Volo and Girantina lmao.
    He has such a friendly face!
I can‚Äôt believe I had to scroll this far down to see Mantine. Mantine crew represent!
Since Mantine carried my Elite 4 run in Renegade Platinum Nuzlocke, and being the only pok√©mon able to do what it did, it holds a special place in my heart too <3
Its lil face is so cuuuute! I love Mantine
Mantine and Lapras are in my top 5 of all time Pokemon. And the others I'm fond of as well. My name on oooooold forums used to be mantinegirl lmao
Were you around to see it in permanent rain? Thing was unstoppable.
    Rain dance plus swift swim combo is so deadly. üò§
        And that was before fairy type... Gen 5 weather wars were really something else!
I always thought Golduck was really cool. Especially as a kid it was nice that all the stats were the same since I had no concept of attack vs special attack.
Yo, a fellow Golisopod line enjoyer! I want to get a whole team of Golisopod and name them all Guzma!
    A full team of emergency exiter sounds funny
My girls!
First impression everydays
Hey guys, did you know that in terms of human companionship, Flareon is objectively the most huggable Pokemon? While their maximum temperature is likely too much for most, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along with that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch. But that's not all, they have a very respectable special defense stat of 110, which means that they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. Because of this, if you have a bad day, you can vent to it while hugging it, and it won't mind. It can make itself even more endearing with moves like Charm and Baby Doll Eyes, ensuring that you never have a prolonged bout of depression ever again.

EDIT: This is a lot of upvotes and more awards than I expected, considering I just pasta‚Äôed what I copied
    #wholesome
    You hug Flareon solely for how sorry you feel about it having 130 attack and not being able to properly utilize it for the first 3 gens, finally getting the much needed physical special split in gen4 only to have your only physical STAB being "Fire Fang" while your betters get Fire Blitz, and in later gens, finally getting Fire Blitz but having power creep make you absolutely unusable.
        Flareon got Flare Blitz in the same game where Entei got Sacred Fire
            Being Flareon is suffering, also wasn't Sacred Fire a special move?
                Nope, it's been physical ever since the physical-special split
    I almost skipped over this because I thought you just commented the original (cursed) thing, and I was pleasantly surprised to read this. Thank you for wholesome facts about Flareon
    This is why I will always adore Flareon and it will be my absolute favorite despite it getting shafted
    I'm sure having a Leafeon would be extremely calming as well. It does actual photosynthesis, so your house would always have fresh air. I also think of Eterna Forest and it's music when I think about Leafeon, because that's where the first ever Mossy stone was. Walking through a quiet forest with one might be relaxing.
    Ngl, if Pok√©mon were real I'd probably have a Flareon just for hugs. Arcanine too, but he'd double as land transport.
Same.
    Same.
        Same.
I've got a softspot for all the Eeveelutions, come on Gamefreak, give us the rest, you know you want to.
    I'd kill for a dragon type eeveelution.
        Sword and Shield would‚Äôve been the perfect time to introduce Dragon and Steel. Then Arceus could‚Äôve introduced Rock and Ground with its ancient aesthetic
    The fact that they‚Äôre probably gonna stop making Eeveelutions despite their whole gimmick being one for each type is mildly infuriating.
    At minimum we need Dragon so all the "special" types are covered.
Same. Vaporeon had always been my favorite and I hate what the internet did to them v.v
_Did you know..._
    *that in terms of...*
        DONT YOU FUCKING DARE
        *male human and female Pok√©mon...*
            Me: hmm, wonder what they are talking about...

*Googles "vaporeon reddit". First result...*

Me: yup, found it.
                TIL that r/furrypasta is a thing.

If anyone needs me, I'll be over in r/eyebleach for awhile.
            LEAVE VAPOREON ALONE!
            *breeding, Vaporeon is...*
Vaporeon 4 life
Dewgong gang unite! All four of us!
    And my axe!

Really though, loved Dewgong back in the day, and Aurora Beam was so satisfying to use. Yeah, it's not as strong as Ice Beam, but the gen 1 animation for Aurora Beam was surprisingly fire, especially coming off of Dewgong
    Dewgang
Yes! I freaking love his :3 face!
    I love you guys. You're so cute.
Yes!!
And now we are five
Dewgong was my first lvl 100 Pok√©mon way back in Pok√©mon yellow!
Happy to see more Dewgong enjoyers in the wild.
When I commented earlier, Dewgong was nowhere to be seen. Nice to see it climbing up a little, it has such an underrated but gorgeous design.
There he is!
The OG type coverage of GS.
Octillery is my guy! One of the most exciting johto mon, an amazing second water type to bear the burden of water hms in rse/oras, AN OCTOPUS, and his move pool is cool is hell! ‚ù§Ô∏è  ü¶ë

E: corrected typos; I got too excited
    Octillery is incredible. It has a nice Shiny, an interesting design premise, and it's so useful in sixth gen. Absolutely my ace, have one in every one of my sixth gen games. And it's so nice to know that a lot of people share the same thoughts! I certainly didn't think so when I scrolled through the comments of this post.
I also like grapploct as well both are pretty cool
    Yes, Grapploct is awesome, it's just not a water type.
        Which is crap. I remember catching one for the first time and thinking that having a water/fighting type was going to be awesome... I was disappointed
I love octillery too!
>araquanid 
 
My favorite water type is the og water/bug type: Surskit. I personally have not seen an araquanid in real life, but I've seen bugs that look vaguely like surskit in california, washington, and  minneosta just chilling in calm bodies of water. Great design for that type combo.  

Lapras for gen 1, and lanturn for gen 2 are great also.
    Surskit full carried me through my first run. Him and the fire chicken and I breezed through.

Young me was lucky, it takes me longer now because I worry about silly things like type coverage and status moves.
        Before getting into competitive: man I love Pokemon

After getting into competitive: spending 30 minutes on route 1 because I refuse to proceed with a Modest Starly
    I love surskit, wish it kept the water/bug combo upon evolving.
my absolute favorite out of the 900+ pok√©s!!

 .>>( . ___ . )<<
    Same for me! Idk what it is, I just love woopers adorable face
Wooper gang!
Woop woop!!!
Had to scroll way too far to find the woopy boy squad.
\*foists stuffed fossil fish over head\*

YES. There's more than one of us for once!

If I'm being honest though, I'd take relicanth even *with* starters on the table. (Though I do quite leik mudkipz)
    I mean, I love coelacanths, so that plays into the bias, but I also love going into raids with the shiny Relicanth I hunted. I imagine people being baffled about why I brought it in. . . 

Until the hard stone boosted stab rock head recoil-negated head smash does a ton of damage.
        One of the Pokedex entry flat out tells us it's the perfect pokemon because it's never evolved. Even the devs know he's the best.

I love Relicanth too. He looks like a cool, living stealth submarine.
I also unironically like Relicanth. I remember giving out hundreds of the little buggers on wondertrade. Never did get a shiny.
    The shiny hunt for it (I overworld hunted it in Crown Tundra) was hell. I stopped counting, but I was at a couple thousand encounters before it shined. Toughest hunt I‚Äôve had yet - though my current Absol one is going to usurp it soon.
Had to scroll too far for this. Relicanth holds a special place in my heart.
This guy gets it. Love the gimmicks with Azumarill and Cloyster.
Still have ptsd from when Cloyster became OU, ‚Äòmons a menace lol
Belly Drum/Aqua Jet Azumarill is a mood
Wailord Gang!
    Beeg boi!
        I love that chonky boi!
My people! We love a big ole whale.

Starmie is such a good Pok√©mon in LG. So easy to get and learns hella good moves via TM
    Starmie is absolutely insane, its a must have in every team I build because she has amazing coverage
        Starmie has been a staple in all my games. My favorite pokemon hands down.
    Surf, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Recover - sweeps through the entire game.
        That's a good set, but with all the poison types in FRLG you might as well throw psychic or psybeam on there instead of either ice beam or thunderbolt. Depending on your other team members.
    Starmie is the sleeper OP pick. It's an amazing sweeper and perfect for regular playthroughs.
    And it's fun to ride on
    What‚Äôs LG?
        LeafGreen
Mine too. Staryu has been my favorite Pok√©mon since its first appearance in the anime.
    It was the anime that made me a fan of Staryu.  I loved its "hya!" cry.
Had to scroll too far for this. FeelsBadMan
    For real. Starmie deserves better. Gen 1 all star for me
HYAH
    HYAH
Starmie has been my favourite pok√©mon ever since I saw its first card. This was easy for me.
Starmie is my favorite! Spinning and ‚Äúhya‚Äù it‚Äôs way into my heart since the first anime
I remember being a kid and always trying to catch starmie never could though
I can't believe I had to scroll this far to find Starmie! Absolute goat!
Red Gyarados was my boy in Crystal
I'm honestly mind blown this isn't the overwhelming majority opinion
    There‚Äôs actually a ton of cool water types
    Because it is a bit stale for most people I assume, like the boring safe answer, like as a Pok√©mon it doesn't end up feeling special
        Whenever I do a replay of Fire Red, it always begins with me saying that I‚Äôm not going to use the same Pok√©mon as I always do. But no matter what I do, Gyarados and Kadabra weasel their way onto my team anyways
            I am physically incapable of not having Kadabra on my team in every pokemon game
                I don‚Äôt blame you, Kadabra is just so good. Cool design, high special attack, and recovery to make up for the weak defense.
        Yeah, one problem is that seemingly every single pokemon game has made Gyarados accessible early on. It's so strong, so easy to get, and Gamefreak puts it in every game (even when countless others get stiffed until end game). It's a natural choice for its stats, but I have to force myself to not use it because it'd be boring (usually I try and use 100% unique teams every time I play).
        Like a thread asking "Who's the greatest composer of all time?" and answering "Mozart".
        It does feel kinda like that, I agree. But being true to myself and answering the question directly I still say Gyarados everytime.

They might not be that special but they're definitely versatile, at least. Every Gen I play, I use one on my team, never with the same moveset or role but they're always there.
    That might mean that either Gyarados is overrated or everyone is trying to avoid it so as not to seem "basic".
no matter how hard i try I'm lured to our good noodle
I still remember in the old days on Pok√©mon Blue, I just couldn‚Äôt figure out why Magikarp even existed until one day from a game manual or something found out it evolves into Gyadrados‚Ä¶ i mean even obtaining a fishing pole felt like uncovering some secret. I didn‚Äôt really believe it but still leveled it up until it actually did. It was such a cool experience as a kid
    
>I didn‚Äôt really believe it but still leveled it up until it actually did. It was such a cool experience as a kid

These things were absolute magic as kids
    I remember buying the team rocket Magikarp in Pokemon Yellow and leveling up like crazy. It was so much higher than any other pokemon on my team. In the Misty gym battle, all my others had fainted and it was down to Magikarp. It somehow flopped its way to victory against both Staryu and Starmie. That was the most memorable pokemon battle I've ever fought.
        Mine as a kid was managing to beat Brock's Onix with my last pokemon, an under levelled Nidoran, because I was just timing those bides perfectly.
    Man your story reminded me of finding the power plant and Zapdos as a kid. Had no idea it existed, felt like finding real life secret treasure.
    I loved goldfish as a kid and was just super stubborn and thought, ‚Äúthis fishy has to learn a good move sometime‚Äù then it evolved and became a badass and I‚Äôve used it in every Gen since lol
The only correct answer
Playing silver for the first time and catching the red Gyarados.  So satisfying.  Didn't leave my team.  And hasn't anytime I've replayed S,G, or C.
    God, I remember how I refused to give whatshisnameagain the red gyarados skin as a trade in for the XP-share because I thought I'd be left with a normal gyarados then...

Oh, to be young and stupid again ^ ^
Gyarados has been my favorite since childhood
    same
    I still remember seeing it‚Äôs evolution for the first time, such a good time.
Gyarados is easily my second favorite, but Spheal is just perfect
Magikrap to Gyarados is the most mind blowing power jumps ever
It's funny how this is probably true for majority but they try to be "original" by not saying gyarados even though it's the ultimate truth

Edit: Lapras and mioltic are other obvious candidates that I spaced
    I was Gen1 kid, and then mostly put Pokemon aside until getting back into via Pokemon Go. Gyrados is absolutely the nostalgia answer, but replaying as an adult I find myself much more drawn to others that I never paid attention to before. Poliwrath, Starmie, and Golduck are all more interesting to me now than Gyrados, not really sure why.
    I thought 90% would say lapras, blastoise is my favourite when gen 1 came out everyone picked charizard and i chose blastoise and loved him ever since.
        Absolutely LOVE Blastoise. Big chonky dog turtle boi with ACTUAL CANNONS for weapons.
Absolutely
Straight up the right answer
Definitely team gyarados. Not even close.

Poliwhirl in a distant second.
I like Gyarados but it's so good and cool that I feel so mainstream for liking it lol
objectively correct
They are just so :)
    He‚Äôs so derpy and I DEEPLY love him for it
        Any Pok√©mon with absolutely nothing behind their eyes is S-tier in my eyes
Did a water mono type team through Shield.   This dude carried that team hard
    Also one of the only mons that could beat Zacian before it was banned in competitive singles. Truly the god slayer
    That's nothing, try it in Colosseum and see how hard it carries there.
Aquire the sire

Correct.
They are the best bois
My boy is still relevant in competitive as a wall, he has a great ability called Unaware that ignores stat changes so you can switch him into a set up sweeper with no problem
This guy gets it, Clawitzer W
Clawitzer gang
GO CLAWITZER!!!
LIVING WATER CANNON FOR THE WIN!
Choice Specs Clawitzer with Mega Launcher boosted Aura Spheres, Dark Pulses and Terrain Pulses is so much fun
    Since Clawitzer is in the PaldeaDex, you should try Terastallizing one into a Fighting-type and fire off an Aura Sphere at ~~an innocent civilian~~ a Ferrothorn
üëë
Absolute W
I am sad I had to scroll so far to find one of the crab boys :0

Clawitzer is mx favorit, followed by Kingler...Dwebble ties with them, though it ain't water type
Claw our way to the top boys!
I've always wanted an all crab team. I hope the rest of the crabs make it into Scarlet and Violet so I can finally live the dream.
    ü¶Ä Crab people! Crab People! ü¶Ä
        Taste like crab, talk like people
        ü¶Äü¶Ä Game Freak won't respond to this thread ü¶Äü¶Ä
    100% my thoughts when I saw Klawf.
Cookie cookie
A Kingler just recently ended up being one of my two battlers in my Shield playthrough. That thing hits like a truck. I even went ahead and gave it GMax.
Kingler is such an underrated Pok√©mon in general. Not my favorite water type but top 5 easily.
Yeah I don‚Äôt know why I like kingler so much, but I do
Kingler gang!!!
I rewatched Pokemon season 1, and some of the Krabby jokes are hilarious in that season. First Gary‚Äôs Krabby is much bigger, then Ash catches Professor Oak almost cooking his Krabby into a soup. Poor Krabby!
My very first shiny! Also as a kid I was convinced that he is a legendary god by that one pokemon episode where the tentacools attack a city
    I am so disappointed by Tentacruel‚Äôs power level in the games!
One of my favourites, period. 

I love how underestimated it is, due to being a random encounter pest. Sure, Golbat couldn't do much, but Tentacruel was an absolute beast, even more so back when Special was just one stat.
I love Lumineon‚Äôs design, too!
Can I upvote more than once? 

Honourable mention to Chinchou too. Named my Lanturn Chimchow in honour of my dyslexic childhood self.

And yes, I was the kid who pronounced Kyogre as "Kai-ro-juh"
    As a kid I was actually disappointed by Chinchou evolving into Lanturn.

Now there's nothing wrong with Lanturn, it's a cool pokemon, but as a kid I was hoping for a continuation of the angler fish vibe than a dolphin.
        ... am I remembering everything wrong or isn't Lanturn an angler fish?
            I called it a dolphin but the tail is definitely still fish-like.

So it has all the elements of an angler fish with the tail and the lure but it's too...friendly?
                Dude, you may think and feel that chinchou is your friend but trust me, he isn‚Äôt.
            It‚Äôs like a cuddly friendly anime lantern fish
I remember using Lanturn for the first time in silver. I found it super cool to have a Pokemon with "contradictory" dual typing.
Saaaaame. Love my squishy Lamp Boy.
lanturn is awesome, soak + electricity is fun
    Super effective STAB everyone!
Username doesn't check out, but I second Corsola
I can‚Äôt believe I had to scroll so far! Corsola was my first ever shiny hunt because of how cool it is. I‚Äôm o
IM NOT THE ONLY ONE.

IVE ALWAYS LOVED CORSOLA
Severely underrated Pokemon, this thing is such a beast. And the solo form is such a cute little fish stick!
    Came on to say exactly this. Players underestimate it because it has an obvious weakness, but until it drops under 25% health it's stats rival Kyogre! Unbelievable for a non-legendary Pok√©mon, and with the right support its one of the strongest water types you could ever ask for
    > this thing is such a beast

Its very low speed and HP are really its Achilles heel, though. Especially since really only 75% of that HP is usable due to its ability.

It's an absolute beast in the mid game when you're often up against opponents that aren't fully evolved yet ... but by the end of the game when you're up against tougher opponents, Wishiwashi really starts to lag behind, becoming quite vulnerable to taking hits due to that low speed ... and not being able to tank very many hits because of the low HP.
        Its low speed is rather unfortunate, I'll give you that. I've found the HP to be manageable though, since School Form's defense and special defense are very high and it can learn Aqua Ring for recovery. It's more than usable in the late game in my opinion, and it's always a fun Pokemon to play with. You are absolutely right that mid-game is its biggest strong point though, thing is an absolute unit at that point in the game
            Yeah... In my experience, Wishiwashi goes from absolutely carrying my team in the mid game to being my team's weakest link in the late game.
Incredible name, form gimmick, lore, half amazing shiny. What more do you want
And it has just a banger name.
Buizel the best!
    Yes!
Gastrodon is really underappreciated, it's my second favorite ground type
Daggum, sharpedo is way too far down. Gimme dat speed boost!
    My speedy torpedo boy that looks cuddly - and my theory is if he has speed boost rather than rough skin, he actually is!
Jellicent 100%, its such a good design
I am so glad I kept scrolling, definite agreement here
Jellicent is the best
Pringles jellyfish
Slowking gang
    My brethren
My Gastrodon carried me through legends Arceus - and it having storm drain in the main series makes it super useful.
    Gastrodon carried me through Brilliant Diamond it's so good
I love them so much. So happy, aloof, and chill. Gastrodon knows his shit but doesn't feel like he has to prove it to anyone. He doesn't clamor for the spotlight because he knows you'll come back to him anyway, and he won't try to make you feel guilty about your brief stint with Swampert. He'll just say how awesome it is to see you again and ask if you want to go to that ice cream stand you love so much. He doesn't just accept, but loves you for who you are in ways no one on tinder will ever match. He's so perfect that no one can judge him for having an anxiety attack whenever he tries to mow the lawn. Gastrodon is a friend for life.
Person of culture, I see
scrolled too far for this answer
He has high speed because he‚Äôs a buizy boy and has to rush everywhere
Super cute. Really appealing and unique colour scheme for a Water type. Oozes personality. What's not to love?
I love the design of Buizel and Floatzel. Plus who doesn't love otters? If I had to choose one just for fun, it would be them.

For a more competitive team, probably Vaporeon, Lapras, or Milotic.
I think it's kind of funny that everyone loves Buizel but no one seems to care about its evolution, Floatzel.
    I love them both!
The correct answer <3
Yes! He's underrated
I have a shiny Politoed named gummy!
    I have found our banner. I am home.
Loving Politoed even before it got Drizzle.
I've loved politoed for a long time, and I'm kinda sad I've never actually been able to use one in any of the games.
    I did a whole run in gold with just a politoed, worth it
THANK YOU, A PERSON OF CULTURE
i had to scroll too far to find this
Slowbro is my favorite mon. Look at him he‚Äôs a dumb pink hippo.
Slowfam my beloved ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Slowpoke and Slowbro are my favorite water-types by far, and I even have a mold fondness for Slowking.
I think of Slowbro as a Psychic type so I forgot about him
Same, the first pokemon episode with them in it. Goldduck kicked some ass. They could really use that Psychic sub type though.
Let's go duck gang. Always loved goldduck since gen 1
Love golduck, candidate for coolest Pok√©mon
    He deserves to ate least on the top 10
Had to scroll way too far to see this. I guess that's why he didn't get the gen 1 buffs that some others did.
    Same I scroll all the way down here looking for my people!
No legendary Mons, this one PYUKS all over OU since Ferrothorn got banned for being disgustingly homophobic
    What r/stunfisk does to a mf
        How did r/stunfisk affect the fan base meta?
u/MudkipNerd I found you a friend
Knew I'd find this answer here, just surprised it wasn't higher
He was Red‚Äôs starter :)
    I did a poll on here once. Most people associate Pikachu or Charizard with Red. Poliwrath came a distant third, ahead of Venusaur. We know that Poliwrath is the right answer, though.
        Poliwrath is really just for manga red though right? Game red never uses the poli line afaik.
            Yeah but manga Red is best Red :P
        Poliwhirl evolving is one of my favourite moments in the manga. I like using Red‚Äôs manga team sometimes when I play through Kanto.
You are absolutely right.
No one can or will fight you.
Poliwrath my beloved ü•∞
Poliwrath gang rise up
Poliwrath isn't bad but I love Poliwhirl so much I never want to evolve him. Politoed is great too but same problem.
Damn I had to scroll so far for the correct answer!
How is this so low? Always my water choice in red.
I always nickname them Gloves
Orange otter with floaties best boi
Was looking for someone else who likes Floatzel. Way too far down!
I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for lotad
Golisopod is such a cool pokemon
>1. Vaporeon

Heh.
    *oh no*
        #[OH YEAH!](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CHUuujSW8AAVZTg.jpg)
    Why not Vaporeon?
        Don‚Äôt ask, stay uninformed.
        You don't want to know
            Kinda getting the vibe that there‚Äôs a massive market for Vaporeon furry porn that I don‚Äôt want to find.
                While I'm sure there's plenty, I'd wager it's more about the copypasta.
                Rule 34

            Okay my suspiscions have been confirmed
                Im sorry lol
        HEY GUYS, DID YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF‚Ä¶
I thought more people would share your opinion, but I'm with you on this one. I know it's blasphemy, but I always felt like Seismitoad is cooler version of Poliwrath (which I also love and would probably be number 2)
I used a Seismitoad in White and it‚Äôs awesome!
Vaporeon, let‚Äôs go
Not a fan of the shiny, but had to scroll too far to find my answer.
    Haha! I don't blame you as I know a lot of people tend to not like Pink and Yellow let alone the two combined xD it's the same reason I love Ferrothorn...well one of the reasons.
I had to scroll way too far to find my boy Whiscash.
    How sad, whiscash is best fish, he should be up higher
It just looks so happy
Orange shiny? Isn't Cloyser navy blue in its shiny?
    Yes. I believe shellder is orange shiny tho
    Yes i misspoke
I feel like I had to scroll way too far to find my man, Cloyster. He‚Äôs the best!
    Lol I slept on him like everyone else and eventually did a run with pokemom I never used. Found a new favorite doing so!
My main competitive Pokemon over the years is my Skill Link Cloyster, yeah.
I love a lot of water types. And he is right at the top. I love his dumb face.
All great choices. Magikarp is awesome even without evolving.
It's a shame I needed to scroll so far to find this. Corfish is so awesome.
FINALLY SOMEONE ITS SO GOOD THEY GLOW PRETTY
Yeah, obviously Feebas.
Based bibarel appreciator
Pelipper is a good bird! Only the best for Pellies!
Pelipper with Drizzel/Hydro Pump/Hurricane hits like a truck with insane coverage.
I love West sea gastrodon!
Hell yeah, dude! Let‚Äôs hang out down here at the bottom of the thread where only the cool kids will find us. Tentacruel is life.
Masquerain is bug/flying
Design is more important than if they're good or not competitively in my opinion lol
Araquanid is incredible on mono big teams,not sure about others though
So level 15 Magikarp
I love Ludicolo so much. Just a happy little guy with some sick dance moves
DOZENS!
    DOZENZ! (√ó2)
I'm team Spheal, close enough.
    I would die for spheal
Milotic became my favorite over vaporeon
    hey guys
        Did you know...
            That in terms of...
    I hate this comment.
I must have it in every game I play.
Especially in shape. Spheal is the perfect shape.
Spheal with it
Fuck it he ball
Round boy indeed ‚ù§Ô∏è
Shaped like a friend <3
Careful that thing can learn sheer cold
Drawfee! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
and his big meaty hands
I was looking for this, haha
It's up there. I still think nidoking rhydon, tyranitar and kanghaskan are all equally the most pokemon looking pokemon. Than lapras is right below them.

Tbf though wasn't lapras like the 3rd pokemon to ever be designed?
    And Rhydon was the first
    Did you start playing at Gen 1? All the Pokemon you listed look like the generic icon you see in the menu
        Yeah that's probably why I think that, they look like the gym statue as well. I started with diamond, it's only really been since gen 6 I've felt like this
Yes! I know what you mean
It looks like a legendary imo. Love the design for Lapras
Magikarp to gyarados probably comes from an old Japanese legend saying that if a carp climbs up a waterfall it becomes a dragon
Canonical It was, but over the years has been brought back from the brink of extinction
Truth! Isn't it one of the few that were actually able to commicate with humans, like mewtew?
Whiscash gang forever. I will never forget how my Whiscash was the last one standing against Volo and Girantina lmao.
He has such a friendly face!
Rain dance plus swift swim combo is so deadly. üò§
    And that was before fairy type... Gen 5 weather wars were really something else!
A full team of emergency exiter sounds funny
#wholesome
You hug Flareon solely for how sorry you feel about it having 130 attack and not being able to properly utilize it for the first 3 gens, finally getting the much needed physical special split in gen4 only to have your only physical STAB being "Fire Fang" while your betters get Fire Blitz, and in later gens, finally getting Fire Blitz but having power creep make you absolutely unusable.
    Flareon got Flare Blitz in the same game where Entei got Sacred Fire
        Being Flareon is suffering, also wasn't Sacred Fire a special move?
            Nope, it's been physical ever since the physical-special split
I almost skipped over this because I thought you just commented the original (cursed) thing, and I was pleasantly surprised to read this. Thank you for wholesome facts about Flareon
This is why I will always adore Flareon and it will be my absolute favorite despite it getting shafted
I'm sure having a Leafeon would be extremely calming as well. It does actual photosynthesis, so your house would always have fresh air. I also think of Eterna Forest and it's music when I think about Leafeon, because that's where the first ever Mossy stone was. Walking through a quiet forest with one might be relaxing.
Ngl, if Pok√©mon were real I'd probably have a Flareon just for hugs. Arcanine too, but he'd double as land transport.
Same.
    Same.
I'd kill for a dragon type eeveelution.
    Sword and Shield would‚Äôve been the perfect time to introduce Dragon and Steel. Then Arceus could‚Äôve introduced Rock and Ground with its ancient aesthetic
The fact that they‚Äôre probably gonna stop making Eeveelutions despite their whole gimmick being one for each type is mildly infuriating.
At minimum we need Dragon so all the "special" types are covered.
*that in terms of...*
    DONT YOU FUCKING DARE
    *male human and female Pok√©mon...*
        Me: hmm, wonder what they are talking about...

*Googles "vaporeon reddit". First result...*

Me: yup, found it.
            TIL that r/furrypasta is a thing.

If anyone needs me, I'll be over in r/eyebleach for awhile.
        LEAVE VAPOREON ALONE!
        *breeding, Vaporeon is...*
And my axe!

Really though, loved Dewgong back in the day, and Aurora Beam was so satisfying to use. Yeah, it's not as strong as Ice Beam, but the gen 1 animation for Aurora Beam was surprisingly fire, especially coming off of Dewgong
Dewgang
I love you guys. You're so cute.
Octillery is incredible. It has a nice Shiny, an interesting design premise, and it's so useful in sixth gen. Absolutely my ace, have one in every one of my sixth gen games. And it's so nice to know that a lot of people share the same thoughts! I certainly didn't think so when I scrolled through the comments of this post.
Yes, Grapploct is awesome, it's just not a water type.
    Which is crap. I remember catching one for the first time and thinking that having a water/fighting type was going to be awesome... I was disappointed
Surskit full carried me through my first run. Him and the fire chicken and I breezed through.

Young me was lucky, it takes me longer now because I worry about silly things like type coverage and status moves.
    Before getting into competitive: man I love Pokemon

After getting into competitive: spending 30 minutes on route 1 because I refuse to proceed with a Modest Starly
I love surskit, wish it kept the water/bug combo upon evolving.
Same for me! Idk what it is, I just love woopers adorable face
I mean, I love coelacanths, so that plays into the bias, but I also love going into raids with the shiny Relicanth I hunted. I imagine people being baffled about why I brought it in. . . 

Until the hard stone boosted stab rock head recoil-negated head smash does a ton of damage.
    One of the Pokedex entry flat out tells us it's the perfect pokemon because it's never evolved. Even the devs know he's the best.
The shiny hunt for it (I overworld hunted it in Crown Tundra) was hell. I stopped counting, but I was at a couple thousand encounters before it shined. Toughest hunt I‚Äôve had yet - though my current Absol one is going to usurp it soon.
Beeg boi!
    I love that chonky boi!
Starmie is absolutely insane, its a must have in every team I build because she has amazing coverage
    Starmie has been a staple in all my games. My favorite pokemon hands down.
Surf, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Recover - sweeps through the entire game.
    That's a good set, but with all the poison types in FRLG you might as well throw psychic or psybeam on there instead of either ice beam or thunderbolt. Depending on your other team members.
Starmie is the sleeper OP pick. It's an amazing sweeper and perfect for regular playthroughs.
And it's fun to ride on
What‚Äôs LG?
    LeafGreen
It was the anime that made me a fan of Staryu.  I loved its "hya!" cry.
For real. Starmie deserves better. Gen 1 all star for me
HYAH
There‚Äôs actually a ton of cool water types
Because it is a bit stale for most people I assume, like the boring safe answer, like as a Pok√©mon it doesn't end up feeling special
    Whenever I do a replay of Fire Red, it always begins with me saying that I‚Äôm not going to use the same Pok√©mon as I always do. But no matter what I do, Gyarados and Kadabra weasel their way onto my team anyways
        I am physically incapable of not having Kadabra on my team in every pokemon game
            I don‚Äôt blame you, Kadabra is just so good. Cool design, high special attack, and recovery to make up for the weak defense.
    Yeah, one problem is that seemingly every single pokemon game has made Gyarados accessible early on. It's so strong, so easy to get, and Gamefreak puts it in every game (even when countless others get stiffed until end game). It's a natural choice for its stats, but I have to force myself to not use it because it'd be boring (usually I try and use 100% unique teams every time I play).
    Like a thread asking "Who's the greatest composer of all time?" and answering "Mozart".
    It does feel kinda like that, I agree. But being true to myself and answering the question directly I still say Gyarados everytime.

They might not be that special but they're definitely versatile, at least. Every Gen I play, I use one on my team, never with the same moveset or role but they're always there.
That might mean that either Gyarados is overrated or everyone is trying to avoid it so as not to seem "basic".

>I didn‚Äôt really believe it but still leveled it up until it actually did. It was such a cool experience as a kid

These things were absolute magic as kids
I remember buying the team rocket Magikarp in Pokemon Yellow and leveling up like crazy. It was so much higher than any other pokemon on my team. In the Misty gym battle, all my others had fainted and it was down to Magikarp. It somehow flopped its way to victory against both Staryu and Starmie. That was the most memorable pokemon battle I've ever fought.
    Mine as a kid was managing to beat Brock's Onix with my last pokemon, an under levelled Nidoran, because I was just timing those bides perfectly.
Man your story reminded me of finding the power plant and Zapdos as a kid. Had no idea it existed, felt like finding real life secret treasure.
I loved goldfish as a kid and was just super stubborn and thought, ‚Äúthis fishy has to learn a good move sometime‚Äù then it evolved and became a badass and I‚Äôve used it in every Gen since lol
God, I remember how I refused to give whatshisnameagain the red gyarados skin as a trade in for the XP-share because I thought I'd be left with a normal gyarados then...

Oh, to be young and stupid again ^ ^
same
I still remember seeing it‚Äôs evolution for the first time, such a good time.
I was Gen1 kid, and then mostly put Pokemon aside until getting back into via Pokemon Go. Gyrados is absolutely the nostalgia answer, but replaying as an adult I find myself much more drawn to others that I never paid attention to before. Poliwrath, Starmie, and Golduck are all more interesting to me now than Gyrados, not really sure why.
I thought 90% would say lapras, blastoise is my favourite when gen 1 came out everyone picked charizard and i chose blastoise and loved him ever since.
    Absolutely LOVE Blastoise. Big chonky dog turtle boi with ACTUAL CANNONS for weapons.
He‚Äôs so derpy and I DEEPLY love him for it
    Any Pok√©mon with absolutely nothing behind their eyes is S-tier in my eyes
Also one of the only mons that could beat Zacian before it was banned in competitive singles. Truly the god slayer
That's nothing, try it in Colosseum and see how hard it carries there.

Since Clawitzer is in the PaldeaDex, you should try Terastallizing one into a Fighting-type and fire off an Aura Sphere at ~~an innocent civilian~~ a Ferrothorn

100% my thoughts when I saw Klawf.
I am so disappointed by Tentacruel‚Äôs power level in the games!
As a kid I was actually disappointed by Chinchou evolving into Lanturn.

Now there's nothing wrong with Lanturn, it's a cool pokemon, but as a kid I was hoping for a continuation of the angler fish vibe than a dolphin.
    ... am I remembering everything wrong or isn't Lanturn an angler fish?
        I called it a dolphin but the tail is definitely still fish-like.

So it has all the elements of an angler fish with the tail and the lure but it's too...friendly?
            Dude, you may think and feel that chinchou is your friend but trust me, he isn‚Äôt.
        It‚Äôs like a cuddly friendly anime lantern fish
Super effective STAB everyone!
Came on to say exactly this. Players underestimate it because it has an obvious weakness, but until it drops under 25% health it's stats rival Kyogre! Unbelievable for a non-legendary Pok√©mon, and with the right support its one of the strongest water types you could ever ask for
> this thing is such a beast

Its very low speed and HP are really its Achilles heel, though. Especially since really only 75% of that HP is usable due to its ability.

It's an absolute beast in the mid game when you're often up against opponents that aren't fully evolved yet ... but by the end of the game when you're up against tougher opponents, Wishiwashi really starts to lag behind, becoming quite vulnerable to taking hits due to that low speed ... and not being able to tank very many hits because of the low HP.
    Its low speed is rather unfortunate, I'll give you that. I've found the HP to be manageable though, since School Form's defense and special defense are very high and it can learn Aqua Ring for recovery. It's more than usable in the late game in my opinion, and it's always a fun Pokemon to play with. You are absolutely right that mid-game is its biggest strong point though, thing is an absolute unit at that point in the game
        Yeah... In my experience, Wishiwashi goes from absolutely carrying my team in the mid game to being my team's weakest link in the late game.
Yes!
My speedy torpedo boy that looks cuddly - and my theory is if he has speed boost rather than rough skin, he actually is!
My brethren
Gastrodon carried me through Brilliant Diamond it's so good
I love them both!
I have found our banner. I am home.
I did a whole run in gold with just a politoed, worth it
He deserves to ate least on the top 10
Same I scroll all the way down here looking for my people!
What r/stunfisk does to a mf
    How did r/stunfisk affect the fan base meta?
I did a poll on here once. Most people associate Pikachu or Charizard with Red. Poliwrath came a distant third, ahead of Venusaur. We know that Poliwrath is the right answer, though.
    Poliwrath is really just for manga red though right? Game red never uses the poli line afaik.
        Yeah but manga Red is best Red :P
    Poliwhirl evolving is one of my favourite moments in the manga. I like using Red‚Äôs manga team sometimes when I play through Kanto.
*oh no*

Why not Vaporeon?
    Don‚Äôt ask, stay uninformed.
    You don't want to know
        Kinda getting the vibe that there‚Äôs a massive market for Vaporeon furry porn that I don‚Äôt want to find.
            While I'm sure there's plenty, I'd wager it's more about the copypasta.
            Rule 34

        Okay my suspiscions have been confirmed
            Im sorry lol
    HEY GUYS, DID YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF‚Ä¶
Haha! I don't blame you as I know a lot of people tend to not like Pink and Yellow let alone the two combined xD it's the same reason I love Ferrothorn...well one of the reasons.
How sad, whiscash is best fish, he should be up higher
Yes. I believe shellder is orange shiny tho
Yes i misspoke
Lol I slept on him like everyone else and eventually did a run with pokemom I never used. Found a new favorite doing so!
DOZENZ! (√ó2)
I would die for spheal
hey guys
    Did you know...
        That in terms of...
I hate this comment.
And Rhydon was the first
Did you start playing at Gen 1? All the Pokemon you listed look like the generic icon you see in the menu
    Yeah that's probably why I think that, they look like the gym statue as well. I started with diamond, it's only really been since gen 6 I've felt like this
And that was before fairy type... Gen 5 weather wars were really something else!
Flareon got Flare Blitz in the same game where Entei got Sacred Fire
    Being Flareon is suffering, also wasn't Sacred Fire a special move?
        Nope, it's been physical ever since the physical-special split
Same.
Sword and Shield would‚Äôve been the perfect time to introduce Dragon and Steel. Then Arceus could‚Äôve introduced Rock and Ground with its ancient aesthetic
DONT YOU FUCKING DARE
*male human and female Pok√©mon...*
    Me: hmm, wonder what they are talking about...

*Googles "vaporeon reddit". First result...*

Me: yup, found it.
        TIL that r/furrypasta is a thing.

If anyone needs me, I'll be over in r/eyebleach for awhile.
    LEAVE VAPOREON ALONE!
    *breeding, Vaporeon is...*
Which is crap. I remember catching one for the first time and thinking that having a water/fighting type was going to be awesome... I was disappointed
Before getting into competitive: man I love Pokemon

After getting into competitive: spending 30 minutes on route 1 because I refuse to proceed with a Modest Starly
One of the Pokedex entry flat out tells us it's the perfect pokemon because it's never evolved. Even the devs know he's the best.
I love that chonky boi!
Starmie has been a staple in all my games. My favorite pokemon hands down.
That's a good set, but with all the poison types in FRLG you might as well throw psychic or psybeam on there instead of either ice beam or thunderbolt. Depending on your other team members.
