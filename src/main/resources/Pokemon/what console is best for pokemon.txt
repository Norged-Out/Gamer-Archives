[[what console is best for pokemon]]


I’ve never owned any Nintendo products, and therefore haven’t played pokemon before, but i’m interested in giving it a go. Is there a particular console that’s best for it? I don’t mind buying an older, second hand device like a DS or Gameboy i’m just not sure what will give me the best experience as a new player. Advice pls??


IMO, I'd say the 3DS. You can play gen 1/2 via virtual console, gen 4/5 (plus the gen 2 remakes) via DS backwards compatibility, and gen 6/7 (plus the gen 3 remakes). At this point you'd need to hack it to get the download only stuff onto it since the eShop is now closed but that's pretty easy to do.
    You can play gen 3 too if your console is homebrewed
        True, I was talking strictly stuff that was natively playable but that’s definitely worth mentioning as well.
            gba is natively playable though.
                Right, but the GBA pokemon games were never made available on 3DS. There’s no way to play them without homebrew, unlike the rest of the games I listed.
                    But you can’t get the gen 2/1 virtual console games anymore without homebrew either so that’s kinda a moot point

And if the point is to get a 3DS then install all the games virtually, I would almost recommend emulating on a laptop or something you already own instead of buying new hardware to play old games. Unless the person just likes collecting retro games.
                    oh yeah because some people are fools who don't homebrew there 3dses.
                        Yeah call people fools I’m sure that will show them the error of their ways…
                            well they are and besides fool is a more sanitized word for what they are.
    Can the ORAS and SM demos still be downloaded? Even if you've downloaded them before?
3ds. not a contest.
A modded 3DS will have every Pokemon game from the OG GameBoy to the 3DS; it’ll have the entire game library for them actually. And a Switch has some great options too!
just download an emulator
    This is the way.

Also the only way it's even remotely affordable if you're going for older games.
    Do you know of any good 3DS emulator for Mac? Was having trouble getting Citra to work
        Was this fairly recent?  About two and a half months ago, Citra was shut down as part of a legal settlement with Nintendo.
            It was about half a year ago I think so before that, I actually missed that damn
                It can still be downloaded via internet archives
3DS, easy. I'd also start with 3rd gen, like emerald, because while I adore the second generation, it had a lot of problems, especially with grinding because of how underleveled wild encounters were compared to trainers.
    The trainers are underlevelled too. Red's literally the sole exception when it comes to levels.
3DS. Full stop.
Emulator for all old games, buy a switch if you want the old ones. You can emulate every game through the ds.
3DS, it has a way to access pretty much every generation of mainline games outside of eight and nine
i’ve seen some really good emulators for the switch, and you can play the newer games as well. since it’s an older console you can probably find one pretty cheap
DS Lite all the way. You can play GBA games on it as well.
A modded - key word is modded - switch can play everything: GB/GBC, GBA, DS, 3DS, and the latest games. You can effectively experience the entire series at current all on a single device. It’s hard to find a system already hard modded or capable of soft modding without paying an arm and a leg and it shouldn’t be done by people without soldering experience. If you can find one hard modded for a fair price, grab it. Otherwise, your best bet is to have a Switch for the latest games and a 3DS (easy to mod on your own) for the older games. 

Buying anything older than a 3DS is very niche and very expensive for authentic games, even if you only buy the definitive 3rd version (Yellow, Crystal, Emerald, Platinum) and pick one of each for Black/White, Black2/White2, Heart Gold or Soul Silver.
I got a new 3ds XL, made use of 3ds.hacks.guide, and now I have every mainline pokemon game from FRLG to USUM on there (plus a few spinoffs). It's really easy to do as long as you also have access to a computer!
A hacked 3DS is the best. You can play every game from the first 7 generations of Pokémon on one device.
3DS since the best games are gens 1-5 and you can play all of them on 3DS (assuming you bought virtual console games before the eShop shutdown).
GBA
Get yourself a gameboy advance (ideally SP) and get a copy of pokemon emerald, hands down the best entry point in the series, flaws from gen 1 & 2 are ironed out and its before it get convulted the mega evolutions and all that extra stuff
You have a few options, it really depends which games you want to play. 

1. Nintendo Switch: Easiest option, just walk into any store and grab a Switch and a copy of Pokémon Scarlet or Violet. There is also Pokémon Sword and Shield.

2. 3DS: This is going to be the most bang for your buck, especially if you hack it. It can play all DS and 3DS games (Generations 4, 2 remakes, 5, 6, 3 remakes, and 7) off of physical carts, and you can get gen 1 and 2 on the eshop (now closed, hence the hack)

3. Game Boy Advance: Here's your old-school option, it plays the original gen 1-2 Game Boy games, plus the GBA gen 3 games and gen 1 remakes.

4. Emulation: Not supporting piracy, but you could skip out buying a console at all and emulate these games on a phone or PC. You could by physical games and a cart ripper, then play the games on your emulator of choice (or, you know, obtain the roms in other ways... again, no piracy :) )
I’m going to go against the grain and say the Switch! They’re currently in production so you’re likely to get a good one that isn’t prone to battery or hardware failures. Current and previous generation aren’t legacy, so the games are relatively affordable. Pokemon home is a great utility for managing a collection across multiple,e games and profiles. And you can also try the original games on the virtual console if you want to get nostalgic!

I recommend Sword or Shield as a first intro game - it’s simple, silly and the mechanics teach you much of what you need in Pokemon generally. And Scarlet/Violet are the current generation, so if you want to try battling online, one of them is a must!
    Hey there! Can you explain what you mean by 'virtual console'?  I'd love to play the older games, but I currently don't know how...
    What do you mean try the original games on virtual console on switch ?
Steamdeck with an emulator.
Just emulate
Definitely phone or PC emulation
3DS if you're willing to homebrew.

You have access to Gen 4-Gen 7 games on cartridges, and Gens 1 and 2 on Virtual Console.

Yes, the eShop is down, but if you get creative, you can find them. Like buying a 3DS with the games already on there as an example.

You'd only be missing out on Gen 3, and even then, ORAS is part of Gen 6, and the FRLG games are just Gen 1 remakes.
3ds. You can play the gameboy/gameboy color games, plus the ds and 3ds games
Switch
Nintendo switch
