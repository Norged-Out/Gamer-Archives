[[I think Emerald is objectively the best game]]


Played every game and side game since RB. HG/SS and BW2 have always been my go to games. I played through all of the main games again recently and emerald is easily the longest. Getting all 7 gold symbols from the frontier is the hardest task in any pokemon game. The frontier is way better than HGSS/PL (although I do like that one too)

You also have secret bases. Secret bases should have been in every single main series game moving forward. It makes you feel like a part of the region and like real RPG. You have lily cove sale to look forward to, mirage island, and all of the cool island events to get Lugia, mew, etc. (if you have cheat codes). Sprites are way better than any gen moving forward. Moves look way cooler, colors more vibrant, etc.

In short, I used to think HGSS was best because of 16 badges, red, 2 regions etc. BW2 also has the best story and PWT. But after replaying them all, I can say that if I was stuck on a lost island and could only pick one game, one file, I would choose emerald. If you consider the game incomplete until you get all 7 gold symbols, it is the longest IMO


That's not what objectively means. You're thinking of subjectively.
>I think

>Objectively

You know it's gonna be a great post when the title itself is a contradiction
I'm sick of Redditors' obsession with the word "objectively"
I love Emerald but I think what makes third Gen even better that I don't see talked about a lot was the addition of Gale of Darkness for it's time. I recent got my hands on an authentic copy and my god Gale of Darkness was ahead of its time for sure seeing the Pokemon from one of the best generations in 3D with so much love towards the animations like Pokemon having individual animations for special moves, status moves, and physical attacks is amazing. Their own death animations and damage taken animations. Not to mention the story and being able to battle with the handheld games is incredible it was like seeing some of the coolest 2D still shots come to life. I know Pokemon Colosseum was first but Gale of Darkness took it and just made it better, IMO. 


I have a special place in my heart for Gen 4 games though. Also, I loved X and Y the gen 6 games added cool Pokemon, IMO, and Team Flare, without a doubt, is the darkest team I have ever seen in a Pokemon game and I am glad we are getting remakes despite the fact I have grown to love gen 5 over the years and would love to have seen them as remakes. I do agree Gen 3 is easily some of the best games. 


As to your comment about Battle Frontier I read, very recently, because I have never done Frontier or any Pokemon challenges at the end of the games. That Gale of Darkness's Orre Colosseum has some of the most considered difficult battles and are considered even harder than the Battle Frontier by some people. If you are ever interested.
You have achieved great wisdom and knowledge.


Source: Emerald is my favorite game of all time.
All media is subjective
I absolutely agree. Especially with the end game. The island is endless fun with all the different battle places and rule sets.
I’m playing Emerald again right now and it is really crippled by horrible movesets and old gen TM acquisition. The amount of water, the low Pokémon diversity (at least until post game) and the poor quality of most grinding spots also make the game a slog. The degree of HM restrictions are also very obnoxious, which I guess is a matter of debate, but I’m firmly in the camp that is glad they stopped making these mandatory moves, let alone moves that are irritating to replace. 

The frontier is great, the design of the areas and towns is lovely, but there are aspects of the experience that really drag it down.

I do miss how snappy everything was in Gen 3, though. Dialogue was much more ergonomic and charming. There wasn’t much, but every word was used wisely.
Emerald is not the best simply by virtue of it not being a gen 4 and beyond game.

That's how important I think the physical special split is.

HGSS are the best because they are jam packed with innovations and features. Some of the features in HGSS are things that people beg for nowadays.
    Emerald and/or HGSS might be the best but I still think B2W2 are Peak pokémon games in terms of having the best ideas from previous gens + improvements + content (among all other stuff)

Just being able to press yes to use another repel man... We waited till 2012 for that
        I don't even know why Emerald is in the running for best game in the series.

Emerald is not nearly as good as HGSS or BW2.
*Subjectively
>The frontier is way better than HGSS/PL (although I do like that one too)

See, I like the gen 4 one better simply because it doesn't have the Battle Palace and Arena.

Yes, I consider those facilities singularly horrible enough that they drag the entire rest of the frontier down with them, they're just legitimately unfun and those 2 were easily the worst to get the gold symbols from.

I mean I'm gonna be controversial and say that pretty much all post-game win streak facilities with a few exceptions are just unfun and curated challenge gauntlets like Colosseum's lvl 100 Realgam/Orre Colosseum, XD's Orre Colosseum, and PBR Stargazer Colosseum Master Battles are far superior.
I just revisited Emerald as well. I went back with the goal of completing the regional dex of every gen (gens 3-7). Catching the Regi’s for the second time in Emerald, as well as hunting down Latias/ Latios alone is just so much fun and is super rewarding
Emerald is objectively a Pokemon game released as part of the 3rd Generation as a sort of "final version" of Ruby and Sapphire. It is subjectively the best game in your opinion.
[removed]
HGSS, BW2, Platinum all better sadly.

Emerald is great though, I’ll give it 4th.
Personally if Gen 3 had the physical special split and some of the better move options for some types that Gen 4 introduced it'd be peak.

Basically if ORAS had more stuff from Emerald on top of Delta Episode that'd take the spot for me.

Currently with what we have it's HGSS for me. Though tbh the entire top half of my ranking of all the games is a Hobson's choice and a bit arbitrary because I don't actively dislike most of them. It's probably better expressed more like tiers.
Theres no physical/special split. That makes the combat way worse
Platinum is the better emerald
Nothing is "objectively" good or bad.
the biggest issue i have with gen 3 is it didn't have the physical/special split yet. otherwise emerald would be #1 alongside platinum (my opinion)
Emerald is my favourite game, but HGSS is overall better. But that is mostly due to phy/spe split.
    A game with a terrible overworld, choppy pacing, bad Pokemon distribution and weak boss battles is better? Okay there
        Yes, HGSS is the better game. All pikemon games have flaws but HGSS has more good things for every flaw compared to any other pikemon game.


Also, phy/spe split is by far the most important change pokemon has ever seen. Emerald is an amazing game but that 1 flaw is worse than all the flaws in HGSS combined.
            You're severely overrating the good in these games and underrating the bad

No, the lack of the physical/special split in Emerald is not worse than HGSS's terrible level curve, bad Pokemon distribution, bad boss teams, horrendous pacing throughout the main quest, pathetic rewards for exploring, the list goes on. While yes, the split was important and necessary for the franchise, but the games were never broken before it was introduced

HGSS's good is mostly just aesthetic. The gameplay was a downgrade even from RBY/FRLG, so in no way can it ever be considered better than any other entry
                No I'm not. Of course you are free to have your own opinion and evaluate things differently, but if you ask ME, then I will always say that HGSS are the best pokemon games so far and it's not even really close.

>HGSS's terrible level curve,

I genuinely do not mind the level curve. It gets a big wonky in Kanto, but that's just post game so it's not super relevant anyway.

>bad Pokemon distribution

Gonna have to disagree. You have access to plenty interesting pokemon even very early on. Just because YOU would prefer something else doesn't mean it's "bad".

>bad boss teams

Most boss teams are bad in pokemon games. HGSS actually has some of the most memorable boss battles in the franchise. 

>horrendous pacing throughout the main quest

Not even sure what you're referring to.

>pathetic rewards for exploring

This is just wrong.

>the split was important and necessary for the franchise, but the games were never broken before it was introduced

I never said they were broken, Emerald is firmly as the 2nd best game in my opinion and it WOULD be the best if it had the split.

>The gameplay was a downgrade even from RBY/FRLG

Lol.
                    So it's your personal preference. An unbiased person would look at both games and see the glaring issues with HGSS


>Terrible level curve

You might not mind it, but it is an issue. Why on earth are rocket grunts after the 7th gym in the 20s? Same for wild Pokemon after Blackthorn, where the gym leader is around level 40. This is bad design which isn't present in any other Pokemon game, plain and simple


>Bad Pokemon distribution

You can choose to be ignorant about it, but it's an obvious issue. Most of the region just has your generic Pokemon, and too many good ones are locked to the post game for no apparent reason. That's without mentioning other problems like how the good fishing rods are obtainable too late. With how bad wild Pokemon levels are due to the bad curve, it just amplifies this issue


>Bad boss teams

When the *champion* has 3 of the same Pokemon, something was clearly done wrong. Emerald, Platinum and the gen 5 games have far better boss battles, so HGSS not fixing this was inexcusable


>Horrendous pacing

Ah, the nostalgia argument again. Having literally no battles between Chuck and Jasmine, but then having a barrage of weak and boring at places like the lighthouse and the radio tower are indicative of how much of a slog these games can be


>Pathetic rewards for exploring

Required dungeons are short, lame and easy. You can finish Ilex forest and ice cave in 5-10 mins because they're basically just straight lines with no trainer battles.

Optional dungeons aren't worthwhile to explore. Ruins of Alph is just wasted potential when it just offers pathetic items as a reward. Dark cave gives you jack shit. Union cave gives you a Lapras encounter if you go at a very specific time, so it's easy to miss without any clear indication. Mt Mortar gives you an underleved Tyrogue as a reward for going back *after* getting all HMs. Exploration in these games are just unfulfilling


>Gameplay is a downgrade from RBY/FRLG

Could spend hours getting into details to prove this, but one example is the exploration being much better

Required dungeons like Mt Moon and Rock tunnel offer decently challenging battles if you aren't prepared which helps keep you leveled appropriately for future boss battles

Optional ones give you need rewards for taking the time to navigate them. It's easy to miss the Power Plant, but navigating the maze and taking your chance with fake items reward you with Zapdos. Choosing to go through the seafoam islands and its strength puzzles to get to Cinnabar instead of surfing south of Pallet runs you into Articuno

Nothing like this is present in Johto, and HGSS Kanto lacks any suspense or surprise because the rewards for going to these areas are the exact same


I'd love to see you counter any of these arguments, because no one has been able to so far, further proving how overrated these games are
                        It's hard to counter bias buddy lol.

You don't have to agree with my opinion, but don't pretend like your OPINION is magically unbiased and objective.
no
Didn’t read anything just the header I agree
You misspelled Heart Gold Soul Silver
I might agree if secret bases hadn't been handled absolutely awful in execution--though I guess that's just as much of an argument to keep them and do them better the next time around.

Also, why do people say BW2 has the best story? Its story literally isn't even as good as the game directly preceding it. We went from 3 rivals (including one of the best in the series) to 1, what's the gain, exactly?
I don't think you mis-used "objectively" as many comments say. 

You provided objective reasons for why Emerald is the best. Whether you are correct in your conclusion, or if your reasons are even correct to begin with, is subject for debate. But the statement you're making and structure of your argument completely makes sense. You are objectively not mis-using the term "objective".


Also I might agree, Emerald may be the best
I have to respectfully disagree. I did *not* have fun for a very significant portion of my Emerald playthrough because I kept getting very lost. I got stuck at the town where Team Aqua is blocking off the water to the east because I *could not* figure out where the Team Magma base was and eventually had to look up a guide. Objectively speaking... that's not very good design (I'll admit it is possible they say where it is but I didn't play through that part of the game in one sequential playthrough so I'm guessing it wasn't more than one person's dialogue that hinted at it, which is still a significant flaw).
    Skill issue.
        True tho

You can choose to be ignorant about it, but it's an obvious issue. Most of the region just has your generic Pokemon, and too many good ones are locked to the post game for no apparent reason. That's without mentioning other problems like how the good fishing rods are obtainable too late. With how bad wild Pokemon levels are due to the bad curve, it just amplifies this issue


>Bad boss teams

When the *champion* has 3 of the same Pokemon, something was clearly done wrong. Emerald, Platinum and the gen 5 games have far better boss battles, so HGSS not fixing this was inexcusable


>Horrendous pacing

Ah, the nostalgia argument again. Having literally no battles between Chuck and Jasmine, but then having a barrage of weak and boring at places like the lighthouse and the radio tower are indicative of how much of a slog these games can be


>Pathetic rewards for exploring

Required dungeons are short, lame and easy. You can finish Ilex forest and ice cave in 5-10 mins because they're basically just straight lines with no trainer battles.

Optional dungeons aren't worthwhile to explore. Ruins of Alph is just wasted potential when it just offers pathetic items as a reward. Dark cave gives you jack shit. Union cave gives you a Lapras encounter if you go at a very specific time, so it's easy to miss without any clear indication. Mt Mortar gives you an underleved Tyrogue as a reward for going back *after* getting all HMs. Exploration in these games are just unfulfilling


>Gameplay is a downgrade from RBY/FRLG

Could spend hours getting into details to prove this, but one example is the exploration being much better

Required dungeons like Mt Moon and Rock tunnel offer decently challenging battles if you aren't prepared which helps keep you leveled appropriately for future boss battles

Optional ones give you need rewards for taking the time to navigate them. It's easy to miss the Power Plant, but navigating the maze and taking your chance with fake items reward you with Zapdos. Choosing to go through the seafoam islands and its strength puzzles to get to Cinnabar instead of surfing south of Pallet runs you into Articuno

Nothing like this is present in Johto, and HGSS Kanto lacks any suspense or surprise because the rewards for going to these areas are the exact same


I'd love to see you counter any of these arguments, because no one has been able to so far, further proving how overrated these games are
        It's hard to counter bias buddy lol.

You don't have to agree with my opinion, but don't pretend like your OPINION is magically unbiased and objective.
So it's your personal preference. An unbiased person would look at both games and see the glaring issues with HGSS
