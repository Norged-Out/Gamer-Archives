[[What Pokémon would you like Ash to use again🧐]]





Like 40 tauros at once
    LMAO. good one. I remember that episode
        Was banned for a while so back when i was a kid we were like "wtf where do those tauros come from?" xD
            During the banned Safari Zone Ep. (It had guns) whenever Ash threw one of his 30 safari balls, a Tauros ran by the pokemon he intended to catch. x30
                Kinda hilarious the episodes with guns are banned in the US.

The irony!
                    We can't have an adult pointing a gun at Ash's head in a kids show.
                        But somehow the squirtle episode with bazooka passed
                            Bazookas and lazer weapons are considered over the top and less likely (or impossible) a kid will be able to get their hands on it. Therefore being kid friendly
                                Fun fact:  
Batman: The Animated Series fought tooth and nail for the permission to have real guns in their cartoon show. Spider-Man: The Animated Series did not, and only had laser guns (and no punching, too aggressive; only kicks allowed).
                                    There was one episode of Spider-Man: The Animated Series that had a real gun. One of the side characters, I forget which one, found his son hiding it and had to chew him out. The showrunner said he felt it was important that it be a recognizable weapon to help get the message across. 

He said he didn't have to fight much for it to be in, that by not constantly fighting the censorship the people in charge were a lot more agreeable when there was something he wanted.
                        But the Growlth police academy was allowed
                            You could argue that it’s a training prop not a real gun.

But also that’s a stupid argument.
                            Can't pass up that sweet copaganda!
                    Hard to understand if you weren’t a kid at the time. Media was in a rampage about child gun safety, every news station in the country was running a bimonthly segment where they would gather up local kids and put them in a play room where they had hidden unloaded guns and then air their reactions when they found them. It was kind of wild.
                Wait that's why he has so many?

That's fucking hilarious
            Oh it's still banned. That episode is most likely never being released outside of Japan.
                I have the comic so I remember. It's a shame really,  you get to see dragonair.


Also episode where James has boobs..I was very confused.
    HAHAHA Only one :(
        They've regularly used a single Tauros as a stand-in for the herd. We've still seen the herd stampeding around the fields at the lab a few times over the years.

Likely that one Tauros is the one Ash used during the Indigo League.
            Ash didn’t use a Tauros in the Indigo league. The first time he actually use one was against Drake in the Orange league
                And he won that league, that's not  a coincidence!
                That's right, it was so long ago I mixed them up
            It wouldn't surprise me if he only still owned the one he used in battle and the rest he donated to the ranch
        i second the 40 tauros at once!
            I third it!
    I just burst out laughing imagining Ash with 40 Hyper Beam/Blizzard/Body Slam/Earthquake spamming Tauros and just sweeping through the entire league
    Lmao
    I'm so glad this was the top comment, because it was my first thought
    Ash can only use 6 of them
        And who’s gonna stop him from bringing all 30 of them?
        Tauros now learned Horde Stampede to get around that.
I'm still waiting for Butterfree to come back...
    we all want it back
        Don’t forget pidgeot
            Ash forgot Pidgeot 😅
                Don't be an ash. Go get your pokemon from the PC every once in a while.
                    I used to teach all the pokemon i caught that i knew i wasn't going to use a spare hm and swap them around as needed every so often so i could pretend i was letting them stretch their legs.
        I third this
        Can we at least get an episode about how it is doing these days? Please, Mr./Mrs.Pokemon-Anime-people
    I wanna see Pigeot or Primeape :'(
        Primeape was such a tease. Ash only had it for like 3 episodes and only used it in the final episode before giving it away to train.
        If the leaks are real and >!Primeape is getting an evolution!< \- assuming Ash returns as Gen 9 protagonist there's no way it's not returning. >!None of Ash's other pokemon ever got cross-gen evos except for Aipom, who didn't evolve until traded to Dawn and Gligar, which he caught in the gen its evolution was introduced in.!<
            I think they only introduced Aipom in the anime because of Ambipom being a thing. 

It's first episode was quite near to the release of Gen IV.
                There were Aipom in the second movie I think.
                    I'm talking about Ash's Aipom
                    Not the species as a whole, but the one Aipom that followed Ash.
                    Detective pikachu loves aipom
            primeape has been gone for 20+ years it’s just never coming back
                Primeape is still the P1 champion of my heart
                    I saw this episode when it aired in 1998. It took me 24 years, but I am just realizing the "P1" is in fact a reference to the NJPW G1 Climax and "Anthony" is a stand-in for Antonio Inoki.
                    Considering how much the anime art style has changed I kinda want to see that guy in the modern style
            Also Ash's Cyndaquil evolved into Quilava outside of Johto seasons. I wanna say it evolved around D/P  and that evolution line didn't have any special evolution or variant until Legends: Arceus. So it doesn't necessarily have to strictly follow the trend
                Yes It evolved at the DP Sinnoh league. That was the same generation we got HGSS maybe a coincidence maybe not
                    No, likely because using a Cyndaquil in your league battle is inane.
            Not true. Pidgeot got a mega. Sadly never returned
                And Butterfree got a Gigantamax form and didn't return either
            If that’s true then they would have brought back pidgeot with mega evolutions. I mean they didn’t even give his charzard and chance to mega evolve and everyone loves him.
        This man’s Primeape won the Heavyweight Champion of the World title belt and he immediately gives him up. Where does it end, Ash?!
    If he's anything like real butterflies he's dead.
        Considering he's got 4 legs instead of 6, let's hope there's something different to his physiology lol
        Nobody ages in this show. Quick evolutions only
            I've seen how they'd draw an adult Ash. This is a kindness.
    Did pidgeot came back?
        No
            Pidgeot was someone’s Christmas dinner
                mine
                    That explains why it's not in the picture
    Why do you have to hurt me this way....
    omg yeeees please :(((
    Dub edit. The original never mentioned returning. Same with Pidgeot.
    Has any of his Pokémon come back after a while?
        [deleted]
            Charizard was never actually released, he left it at a training grounds and brought it back regularly for important battles. Take note of it being in this screenshot.
        Of his permanently released Pokemon (Butterfree, Pidgeot, Lapras, Goodra, Greninja, Poipole) none have returned to his team. Lapras and Greninja got cameo episodes in Johto and Journeys respectively.
Torterra… it actually never got an onscreen W after evolving…

Fought 3 times 

Lost to Volkner’s Electivire

Paul’s Drapion 

Bertha’s Hippowdon

Lost all 3
    I would have liked more input from him, but I think the writers love Ash's fire-type starters😭
        There were many op grass type starter as we like sceptile, rowlet(it's different thing that writers chosed not to evolve it), snivy(ah,..even she didn't evolved), atleast chikorita evolved

P.s.: and yes how can you forget the legendary bulbsaur 
>!even he didn't evolved, cause it ~~makers~~ his choice!<
            Grovyle was amazing, one of my favorites and his battles in the Sinnoh league are memorable
                **I would like to see Pikachu**
            They kept with bayleaf because they knew it was cooler than meganium
                It's not, you folks just hate flowers.
                    I love meganiums design, but I do prefer bayleafs by a pretty wide margin. It's why I've always wanted the johot starters to get megas, I feel like with a little bit extra meganiums design could really well blossom
                        Bayleef always struck me as just edgy Chikorita, one of those middle evolutions that changes so little I might have forgotten it if not for the anime. Meganium is more cute than ferocious but I definitely like its flower collar better than the seed/joint beads, and the pistil antennas are a clever take.

Though I definitely would have liked a Mega, not only for a fancier look but also because Mega Meganium sounds pretty funny.
                            I always thought it was one of the more natural looking middle evolutions. That didn't look to different or edgy.
                        Hah, blossom. It has flowers. Puns.
                    I think Chikorita and Bayleef's head-leaf-scythe sounds more interesting to see in action, and perhaps the show's writers/animators thought that, too
    A grass earth type lose to an elec type is unforgivable
        Yeah I was gonna say what the fuck were the writers smoking lol
            Electivire ice punch, 4x super effective against torterra
                I know the anime doesn’t follow the same rules as competitive, but my headcalc says Torterra takes 85% and OHKOs with EQ   
Edit: 252+ Atk Life Orb Electivire Ice Punch vs. 248 HP / 252+ Def Torterra: 317-374 (80.6 - 95.1%) I was right, but only bulky Torterra.
            Ash's Charizard beats Gary's Blastoise then lost to a Blaziken the next episode. That pissed off 10 year old me and slightly annoys adult me. 

The writers just do whatever they want.
                Welcome to the Pokémon anime where moves are made up and the types don’t matter
        Don't forget hippowdon is ground, which as we know is weak to grass
    Was literally about to say this. For my 2jd favourite pokemon it got shafted so hard, especially when it's such a cool pokemon.

But unfortunately it gets put into the brute archetype, where the big tough guy is always taken down first to show off the threat.
        Like I got no clue why it couldn’t have got the glory of taking down Paul’s Drapion….
            Or Bertha’s Hippowdown...

Or Volkner’s Electivire...
                Especially the electivire with that type advantage
                    So true, and i remember how he would ALWAYS think he had an opportunity to finish off the opposing mon with Rock climb (annoying how he doesnt have any ground moves on his Torterra btw) just for the opponent to easily block or counter the attack and then finish it off..
                At least it should have beaten Hippowdon
                Bertha was an elite 4 duh, ofc ash was gonna lose to her
    Sidenote: I love Swellow just chilling on Torterra
    [deleted]
        Didnt goodra have a 100% winrate?
            It did until the Pokémon League
            It did until Alains Bisharp…
            [deleted]
                Ash’s Goodra sucks. Literally why he lost the Kalos League and because he made dogshit decisions in that much (Noivern against a fucking Weavile)
                    To be fair, this is in the same league where a fucking Pikachu took down a Tyranitar and a Metagross in the same match. The anime does not play by the game rules lmao
                        Greninja did so bad in that match ffs
        So we know he is a hyper offence player
        I thought his Snorlax had some good W-L ratios.
    How about Incineroar? It never even got a single battle after evolving.
        Sure BUT it beat Kukui’s beast mon… the evolved version of itself… like it got the credit it deserved
    That’s my thing, I wanna watch Torterra eat an energy ball, get overpowered, and reck some mons
        Ground is my fav type. How the hell did it lose to Electivire?!
            Electivire must've went for the horns
    It lost to a bloody Hippodown? A Grass type lost to a Ground type!? Yikes.
        Also lost to electivire who was electric and Drapion who was poison, so he had type advantage on all of them
        all three of those were good type MUs lol
    Still wild how it loses 3 battles where it has the type advantage.
    Torterra's arc was about struggling from going from a fast and agile Turtwig, to a slow and clunky Torterra, and just kinda accepting it. Torterra can learn Rock polish, he doesn't need to be slow, just needs help learning a new move. Massive oversight. As much as I like Infernape's arc, Torterra deserved more.
    Yeah, it lost to an electric-type.  The Grass/**Ground** type lost to an electric type.  Should’ve been an easy W, and the anime just said “fuck it.”
        Guess type match ups aren't as important in the anime. I think I prefer that tbh.
            I don’t recall the match exactly, but the only excusable reason is if Electivire used Ice Punch.
                Nah for me the show not being as strict as the games makes it more interesting
This really puts into perspective the heights of all these Pokemon. Leavanny is tiny, Gliscor and Noctowl are gigantic. 

Also poor Torterra. I know he’s big and all, but his head is low to the ground. Heracross and Boldore are gonna get in his way of watching. 

A Pokemon I want to see return? Krookodile. He was Pikachu’s rival of sorts in Best Wishes and was pretty cool. Since Iris is in Journeys, I’d love to see a rematch with her Dragonite.
    They must have forgot how big Ash’s Noctowl is. Back in Johto it was originally shown as smaller than a normal one
        Yeah. It was chilling on his shoulder on occasion.
        It looks like a lot of his pokemon have grown in this pic. His gen 1 and 2 pokemon look consistently bigger.
            I think they initially went by the in-game heights of Pokémon, which make no fucking sense (Charizard is supposed to be 5'7 tall, smaller than your average adult male). Now they just give them all logical sizes instead.
    Swellow is letting him know what's going on.
        "Shall I describe it to you, or would you like me to find you a box?"
    Charizard are canonically only supposed to be 5~6 feet tall, so this image probably shouldn’t be taken as gospel.
        
        Charizard is an alpha because of charific valley that had nothing but alpha charizards
    i mean imagine if he caught a furret, he would have someone towering above them all
    > Noctowl are gigantic.

his Noctowl is actually smaller than a regular Noctowl! so imagine that
Snorlax
    Love it, But first you have to wake him up 😩
        Give him Sleep Talk obviously
            Sure, just as soon as he wakes up
        The Majin Buu of Pokemon
        ZzZzZzZzZz
    Isn't Snorlax statistically Ash's true ace Pokemon? If memory serves me correctly that thing might as well have been a legendary Pokemon in the show.
        Everytime he went to battle, he brought at least one W.
        The fact that it used 6 moves proves its a true legendary.
    The Snorlax story line was always one of my favourites
Kingler was a reel one
    Coooookiiiieeee
    P sure he has the best win rate of any of ash’s mons
        Ash had never even seen it battle yet because he caught it after fighting it with a stick, and he still showed up, evolved, and swept a team by itself. And then was never used again.
            [deleted]
                Perfect IV and Chad
                    Before we even knew what IV's were.
                        It had perfect DVs.
                Based
            Minor correction: Kingler was actually used in the Whirl Cup in Johto. I don’t remember how many times, but I definitely remember it destroying Misty’s Poliwhirl with Crabhammer and then using Vice Grip on Psyduck and getting absolutely wrecked.
                The only bit that I remember from the Orange Island episodes is the Crystal Onix and Misty's Psyduck evolving, so kudos to you for having that kind of memory.
                    Fake evolving, but yeah, the moment was so prominent to me because Ash KNOWS that Psyduck is boss when he gets a headache, so what does he do? Uses a claw to squeeze and cause a huge headache, and he was super cocky doing it, too. Just…the worst tactics.
            Ash found the one Krabby that came to earth as a baby from Planet Krypton and benches him for 25 years.
        Kingler is actually #18.

        Don't forget greninja
    Kingler started my love of the ClampsTM pokemon. Guillotine wiped out my rival's Charizard in the elite 4 in my first playthrough, was awesome.
    Kingler truly was the most crab.
    1v3’d the first mook in the Indigo Conference. Shit must’ve been embarrassing for the other dude, losing to a 10 year-old with a Pokémon he never used up until this point…
        Such an iconic anime moment though.
    thats what i was going to say, kingler didnt take bait from anyone.
    I started a new playthrough in blue just to try out Kingler after it’s performance in the Orange League. To this day it’s been my best performing Pokémon. It could withstand 2 thunders from a higher level electric type easily.
    My favorite one!!
One of his starters from Unova so at least one of them can fully evolve.
    Krookodile is fully evolved if that makes you feel any better.
    Didn't his tepig fully evolve?
        It is still a Pignite as of now.
            You’d think with Ash’s track record of Fire starters with sad backstories that it would’ve evolved and become one of his powerhouses but nope after beating it’s old trainer it just fucked off and that’s despite it training under his own Charizard
                Bianca had Emboar, and they don't usually fully evolve the same starter twice in the same series
                    >Paul’s Torterra & Ash’s Torterra

>Kenny’s Empoleon & Barry’s Empoleon

>Ash’s Incineroar & Kukui’s Incineroar

Trust me I don’t think that’s holding them back
    Unova never happened. What are you talking about?
His only shiny
    Did he ever acknowledge it was shiny? Does ash actually know he has a pretty rare mon? Lol. IIRC someone asked him once why it sparkled and his response was basically “oh yeah it does that sometimes.”
        Yeah they addressed that in the episode it was introduced. It was called a Pokemon of a different colour or something
            Ash also mentioned that its shiny (he didn't use the word shiny) in the diamon and pearl series.
        "It do be like that." *Nods.*
    I appreciate that he only has one shiny. They tend to do a good job of making shinies special.
    He has a shiny??
        I think his Noctowl is shiny
        the noctowol
    \- Squirtle   
\- Bulbasaur  
\- Charizard  
\- Snorlax  
\- Lapras  
If this is Ash's final bout, lets make it official and bring them back to join Pikachu and make the Red team we all know and love.
    Is that why it's massive??

I swear it was smaller than others
        Lol turns out he had a shiny alpha
I’m sorry- NOCTOWL IS BIGGER THAN STARAPTOR???
    Ash's Noctowl is Shiny is bigger than the others, something like that I remember from the episode
        Funny, I remember it being smaller than the non shiny. 🤷🏻‍♂️
        It was actually smaller than the rest but in Journeys it grew to the normal size of its species
            So Noctowl grows but Ash doesn't...
                Reminder that Ash left Alola while Kukui's wife was pregnant and in journeys he cameback and the baby already born.
                    Dialga must be drinking on the job or something.
                    So at least 9 months have passed in the world...
🤣🤣🤣
                    Also there was an episode where Ash is reunited with Lapras and it is also grown taller to the point Ash doesn't recognise it at first...
                My headcanon is that Professor Oak is studying how bonds develop between pokemon and trainers, and Ash and Pikachu are his subjects. Every new league is a new clone of Ash and Pikachu, with the memories of the previous. It explains why Ash never ages and Pikachu seems to fluctuate in strength. Jennys and Joys are clones too, commonly used because they bond well with pokemon suited to law enforcement/healing.
        Its weird seeing them in scale, gliscar is bigger than I thought and Donphan is smaller than I pictured.
        I mean that tracks. Have you ever seen an owl in person? I had one in my yard a couple months ago and was blown away by how big they are
    Noctowls are bigger than staraptors in general. Like over a foot taller.
    That’s an error. Noctowl was noticeably shorter than Bayleef in the episode where Team Rocket stole Ash’s Johto badges.

Kingler, as a Krabby it defeated a fricking Exeggutor (which has the type advantage as a grass type) then evolved and defeated a Seadra and a Golbat next. In total it used 8 moves in just that one battle (Harden, Vise Grip, Leer, Stomp as a Krabby, then Bubble, Water Gun, Crabhammer and Hyper Beam after evolving), and even after he swept his opponent Mandi, A LEAGUE FAVOURITE, Ash just never used it again ;-;
    It also has more attack than the god Pokémon
    Huh?

It lost to Arcanine in a later battle.
        Oh, thnx. I haven’t watched the full series, but I’m glad Ash at least brought him out once more
            He also used it in the Whirl Islands to battle Misty!
    The chaos of the first pokemon league was something cool i wish they did in the other ones, maybe it does i don't watch much of them but ash completely switching up his team with these random pokes he caught a long the way and they end up being great was cool.
    Didn’t it also crack open a Cloyster with Crabhammer?
I see bayleef and i think Mr. Stake. 

Also swellow just chilling on Torterra.
    Tantor! Tantor!
        Happy birthday Ivan. -sobs-
            He was our beloved son! HE WILL NOT BE MISSED!!!! *CRIES IN CORNER*
    THEY TAKE EVERYONE BUT MR STAKE!
        That crit ice beam leaving it with 4hp and came out of confusion was the single greatest nuzlocke moment of all of them in my opinion
    Upvote for team four star
Muk, what a legend
    Bellsprout - 0
Muk - 1
        Get fucking slimed
    haha i love it
    Definitely Muk!
        “Good luck with Muk and Poison Gas

Make one wrong move and it’ll kick your grass!”
            Which is funny because there's only one grass Pokemon that poison is super effective against in Gen 1 and that's Tangela. So really, it wouldn't kick your grass when that song was created
                Technically paras & parasect were as well. Poison was SE against bug in Gen 1, which is why the paras line is the only Pokémon to ever have 3 4x weaknesses
    I always love how affectionate they made Muk after Ash caught it.  Horrible smelling pile of goo, but it just wants hugs.
        It stared out all scary and once he caught it, it acted like one of those big dogs that always wants to sit on your lap lol
    Muk is unironically one of my favorite pokemon.
All of them. One of the worst things about this anime is its refusal to bring back older Pokemon after their saga is over.
    One of my favourite moments is when Ash brings back Sceptile to fight Darkrai and becomes the first pokemon to beat it. Sceptile was probably one of my favourite mons, both in game and in anime. But then again I was also pissed when it got owned by the Latios immediately after
    In all fairness, they producers would only bring back Charizard, because big orange dragon
        I remember an episode where they brought back Cyndaquil I think, after years and years, and he evolved and it was so fuckin HYPE
        But if you think about it, and actually use some reasoning, and check the mathematics behind it, big orange dragon.
            Correct, Dragonite is indeed a big orange dragon.
        Thing is they don't even bring Charizard back in any meaningful capacity any more. Charizard the species still gets plenty of screentime through trainers like Alain and Leon, but Ash's Charizard itself (who by the way is probably responsible for like 90% of that Pokemon's popularity) only really gets cameos at Oak's lab and one fanservice-y return in Black and White after Battle Frontier.
    well hey phanpy did come back after hoenn and became a part of the team, even going as far as to evolve and then participate in the sinnoh league
        They were better with it earlier but from BW onwards, the older Pokemon never really got appearances like that again outside small cameos at Oak's
    Especially this season.

I'd have been happy if he just caught one and kept going back to his buddies.
    That’s because the show is an advertisement for the new generation and a gateway to get kids into the franchise. It’s not meant to be a continuous story that you follow.
        It's less relevant this season as they did a really bad job introducing the new generation anyway.
        That is the root of the issue, yes, but even with that in mind, I can't help but feel this show needlessly spurns a lot of opportunities with regards to continuity, especially post-DP (the current series is a glaring example of this)
Why doesn't Tracy get a chair?
    He’s less valuable than 29 Tauros
    Plot twist. He's actually one of Ash's Pokemon
    Chairs are for Ash's parents
Not a single Noivern comment?!
    Has Noivern ever won a single match-up? It deserves a shot at redemption
        Ash's Noivern fought a great fight against Zapdos right after it evolved. I feel like they couldve been used more, and was done a disservice by Ash for being put up against a part ice type in his battle against Alain
    Not for now, would you choose it?
        *Hell yeah*
    Noivern is my favorite Pokemon of all time, so yes, id love to them return
Snorlax.

His old starters and first stagers who never evolved.

Muk, because I loved him for the short time he was around.

Honestly it'd be nice if he'd just swap in some of his less OP Pokemon to let them stretch their legs.
    I think Snorlax is a Pokémon that will go down in the history books, its strength and strategies are interesting
    His Snorlac has ice punch too, right? Great coverage move.
[removed]
    Ash's Heracross is too Op, I remember that since he caught it in the anime I was looking for it in all the games and I managed it in some, I remember that in the 4th gen it is too tedious to look for it in The trees with honey😩
        Too op they decided to never use him In a gym battle. Ash could’ve beat Whitney first try with him
        In hg/ss you can just keep using headbutt on regular trees in certain areas, I caught my heracross in azalea town
    Heracross is the correct answer here. Also I find it funny that Taillow is chilling on top of Torterra’s tree in the photo.
    Anime Heracross is what caught my attention and wanted to try it out in the games. Now it’s byFAR my favorite Pokémon. It’s so dang good. Just keep birds away.
    I remember when Ash brought his Sleep Talk Heracross to counter Tobias's Darkrai.  Considering the type advantage also that was the most big brained move I've seen him pull at the time.
    Heracross for the fucking win
    Yep same heracross would be my pick
My Totodile bias is huge right now.
    I love that it sounds like Donald Duck
        I loved his personality and how hyper he was on Ash's journey. Really made him stand out and easily made him a fan-favourite. Would love that excitement on Ash's team again, even if for just one episode.
            He is energetic and cute, I would have liked to see how much he could exploit his potential, I feel that Feraligatr, in addition to having a huge butt, is too cute and I still imagine him doing like a duck😩
    Mine too! I love totodile so much I wish he got more support.
I personally loved infernape and torterra. I think torterra wasn't displayed to its full potential. I love that pokemon
    I feel like they have so much more to offer
Tauros No. 22, easily my favorite one.
    I prefer Tauros No. 13
    what about 17?
    Tauros No. 6 is a bit sassy, but boy does it run
    Wrong, No. 9 is where it's at obviously
    Tauros No. 18 makes Tauros No. 22 look like Tauros No. 7.
Torkoal defeating Cynthia's whole team.
    Hahaha, I would give battle to his Garchomp without a doubt
Squirtle with everything and his sunglasses 😎
    Haha love it, one of my choices
    Bring him back evolved and with a wife and kids. Lil dudes been working a job for 20 years unlike the rest of those broke ass pokefuckers living of pokefare.
Literally anyone ffs. The Sinnoh arc remains my favorite because Ash used his older pokemon in the league. I WISH he'd use them in this final masters tourney. Hell I wish he used them more in the gym fights.
    It is also one of my favorite leagues, because it uses the old ones and although it ruined it by putting Torkoal, many did an incredible job like Heracross or Grovyle
    The animation studio are as incompetent as GameFreak is with the games. They genuinely don't understand how to write compelling stories other than copy and pasting memorable ones we've seen before. IE, Gengar's story is just Charmander's again, Butterfree literally had a duplicate with the exact same story, etc.

For Journeys being about "Gen 8" it sure comes across that not even the anime team gives two fucks about that Gen just as much as GameFreak didn't.

Journeys should've been a celebration of 25 years with Ash recalling reserves partnered with his new team to teach them battling over the series. That way by the time the Masters 8 rolls around Ash wouldn't need reserves anymore and we could see his Journeys team finally come together for the first time as the Championship caliber team it should be.

And yet... lol. Here we are.
        Well when they expect viewers to drop the show after 2 seasons they really don't have much of a reason to care about recycling plots. Especially when Ash has been around for so long that he has nowhere else to go as a character.
            older fans don't care about new arcs and new fans don't care about old ones, so no one cares about recycling stuff lol
Pidgeot
    😥
    #justice4pidgeot
Goodra
    You and me both
Infernape would have been perfect for the Stephen fight. Charizard would also be awesome to see go against Leon
    He should have brought Sceptile to fight Steven and Infernape against Cynthia
        Honestly he could have just brought the lucario he has on him, mega him, and swept Stevens whole team . Kinda wish they saved pikachus z move for later in the tourney
Primape and Pigeot
    Primape He hit even Ash, he can with Cynthia team without problem
    That would be OP.
Pidgeot.

\**cries*\*
    butterfree
Squirtle and Bulbasaur, PLEASE! Ash's Pokemon usually just go on to live pretty mundane lives but Bulbasaur maintains the peace at Oaks Lab among the Pokemon and is like a sort of diplomat. Squirtle has a job as a firefighter! He's out there saving lives while Bulbasaur builds bridges between Pokemon of all types. It's the characterization of Pokemon I think we lack nowadays. These days, it seems Ash usually ends up with Pokemon that fall into certain archetypes. A wimpy Pokemon that learns strength without evolving, the rash Pokemon that's too head strong, the one that Ash rescues in some way that decided to join him, etc. That's just my take, anyways.
Am I the only one annoyed that Ash took Mr. Mime away from his mom? Just so he could fill the Psychic & Fairy categories he’s never filled.
    I'm more annoyed that he only used it in one battle.
    We all know the REAL reason why he took it away
        Lmao oh nooooooooooo
>What Pokémon would you like Ash to use again?

Yes
Not gonna lie, and I know everyone is gonna go 'HURR DURR GEN WUN PANDERING' but Charizard, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur. We got a TASTE of Charizard's finished training and I wanna see it applied in a high stakes battle, something we didnt get to see in Gen 4.
    Charizard beat a legendary before his training ended
        He edged Articuno, who was wild. The real time weve seen Charizard's training super pay off is against Iris Dragonite.
    This. It's sad Charizard only had 1 serious battle after he finished training, and it was interrupted before he could finish Dragonite off. 

If this is it for Ash, it will be a big waste not to give Charizard one last important battle. What I wouldn't give to see the OG ace have his last dance.
    Squirtle was the one I was thinking. What a cool dude.
        Squirtle was no slouch, he’s definitely ash’s strongest water starter after Greninja, and I’d say his third strongest water type after Greninja and Dracovish
Oh snivy my beloved.
His Tauros that knows fissure and the shiny noctowl
I want to see Mike used again

Edit: Muk
The professor obviously…
Greninja 

Infernape

Charizard

Lycanroc

Sceptile

Hawlucha

Talonflame 

Goodra

Heracross 

Snorlax

Incineroar
    exactly in that order
Talonflame the first NOT only normal and flying type region bird
    It is one of my favorite regional birds, an incredible design and a wonderful speed and attack, along with Staraptor
BULBASAUR
    AH, A FELLOW MAN OF CULTURE
        Very jealous of your username! Spread the good word of Bulbasaur my friend!
    \- Squirtle   
\- Bulbasaur  
\- Charizard  
\- Snorlax  
\- Lapras  
If this is Ash's final bout, lets make it official and bring them back to join Pikachu and make the Red team we all know and love.
Bulbasaur, Torterra, Heracross.
Also the Swellow sleeping on Torterra's tree is too cute 🥹🥹
Squirtle and Bulbasaur. Huge disservice that neither of them evolved.
    I thought bulbasaur didn’t want to evolve
        And squirtle is too cute to evolve
            Come to think of it, is squirtle in this picture?
                I think it’s off with the Squritle squad.
        If I remember right, yeah, it didn’t want to evolve when all the other Bulbasaur were evolving into Ivysaur. But we never knew why it didn’t want to. Maybe it didn’t like peer pressure? Or it wanted to prove itself as a Bulbasaur before evolving. Point is, Ash should have figured out that reason and tried to help him overcome it so it could become Venusaur and be a real asset to his team.
            > so it could become Venusaur and be a real asset to his team.


Implying it wasn't?!
                For real, in the first several arcs, Bulbasaur is one of Ash's biggest ringers, right up there with Pikachu.

The series is pretty inconsistent in canon with the notion that evolved Pokémon are superior to their precursors.
                    Bulbasaur is also the Pokémon which Ash carried with hin for the second most time. Only Pokémon with more episodes is ofc Pikachu.
Gary Oak
    Haha, I said pokemon not boyfriend
greninja
    I feel like it's more likely to come back
        yeah especially with the part where lucario and ash unlocked battle bond
Oshawott
    Plot twist: Ash chooses something else, Oshawott shows up like it always used to
Infernape, Sceptile, Charizard, Krookodile and/or Noivern.
Snivy.

The fact that she never evolved into a Serperior is mind boggling to me.
Everyone, and I'd like at least one episode for each Pokemon he's released where he reunites with them even if he doesn't catch them again and just occasionally visits. Also, I don't think Torterra can see the screen, and I can see why some people take artistic license with some Pokemon heights.

Infernape
    It would be perfect in his new team
        https://c.tenor.com/isdsI-XKBzUAAAAM/infernape-fire.gif
I'm predictable but Charizard. Although I would love to see his strongest Pokémon come back. Sceptile, Infernape, Greninja in one team for 1 battle especially if he goes up against Leon... man I can only dream.
Charizard
    Do you think she already has little Charmanders?
        Charizard is a she?
            no, but possibly he met a charizard in charizard village and they had beautiful charmanders
                >charizard village

Is charizard no longer staying at the Charcific Valley?
Greninja if possible
Kingler hasn’t gotten to battle since the whirl islands all the way back in mid Johto. He definitely deserves it. He even has a G-Max form. It just fits.

Would also like him to use some of his unevolved mons, (hint: Totodile) and evolve them.

Hell, bring back Primape for an episode.
where's the 49 other tauros...
I'm down with Noivern being used. It's my favorite flying type
Butterfree
All of them had their own personalities and could work with different strategies, but if I had to choose one, I'd say Sceptile. That thing was the only Pokémon _ever_ to defeat Tobias's Darkrai.
Gliscor for sure
NOIVERN HOLY SHIT BRO I DIDNT EVEN KNOW HE WAS THERE
Buizel the GOAT
Charizard
Personally I would like it to me noctowl
His greninja
    is the most likely to return
His shiny Noctowl.. his big beautiful golden owl.. I miss it. </3
Snorlax, he’s such a sweet boi and he always looked liked he had fun battling
Gliscor is huge, I never knew! This pic made me google Gliscor and apparently that Pokemon is 2m tall! That's taller than Charizard or Nidoking!

(Charizard is drawn taller here than it should, also Gliscor's tail seems to be added to his height while Charizard's does not.)
He really should evolve his gible all the way
i always forget he has a shiny noctowl, even in the series the characters have more shiyns then  ihave in any of the games i played
He could make a full team now out of just the ones he’s released.
His Pignite was Mvp in Unova, but the one that definitely desserves another chance is Torterra..
Muuuuuk!
Doesn't ash have over 100 tauros? He should use all 100
Krookodile , those glasses 😎
I’d like to see that Totodile evolve into a Feraligatr and bust some heads.
His full odds shiny noctowl 🙄
Like 90% of the Pokémon in this picture, but for real bring back Muk. When I was little I thought it was hilarious the big scary sludge monster actually acted like a big goofy dog
Not pictured: Butterfree 😢
    i still miss him
Pidgeot and Butterfree
    Butterfree😭😭😭
Kingler
Anyone else think that Pikachu's one hit KO on the mega evolved metagross was a bit oversell, in the recent episode? Like here's this supercomputer that can predict every possible scenario and isn't anything short of a tank judging by its stats, and a one hit KO from a move, granted it was a Z-move but still it didn't have the type advantage either. I think it was kind of lazy writing considering how amazing the previous matches were in the masters tournament
    It also took a Fishous Rend from Dracovish, so it wasn't a one hit KO.
Didn’t he hatch a whole ass Larvitar once in the anime? If so my boy done goofed. Get that man a T-Tar ASAP
Charizard 

Would love to see his charizard vs Leon’s charizard
Naganadel. The existence of Ultra Beasts is likely still unknown to many in the pokemon universe. It would be a great way to introduce Ultra Beasts to the whole world.
Bulbasaur because of the experience he has with him.
Charizard vs Leon's charizard because the whole reason of him staying in charizard Valley to be the best
Snorlax to be an absolute masher once again.
Krookodile, Gliscor, Glailie, Sceptile, and Noivern

Krookodile is a VERY powerful Pokemon, Gliscor is very powerful as well. Glailie and Sceptile can Mega Evolve and they are good Pokemon. Noivern also never really contributed all that much.
I hate how Ash just discards his best so he can get a new team just to lose
hate on me all you want but I want justice for Goodra
Dude I am GROSSLY disappointed he never rotated his roster to include all his pokes. Sirfetch’d/Dracovish are so mid. Would’ve loved for Incineroar/Melmetal/Sceptile/charizard/Infernape etc get some action since this is literally THE GREATEST OBSTACLE IN HIS ENTIRE JOURNEY.
I got a full team I'd like to see him bring back

Infernape

Heracross

Gliscor

Torterra

Kingler

And Donphan

I would like to see him do a full battle with this team. It would be epic. That being said, we'll probably have to dub out Donphan for Pikachu, cuz you know. Ive never been as big of a fan of pikachu like a lot of people, but you can't just take away Ash's ace.
Noctowl and Heracross
Sad squirtle didn't come to watch and chill with it's old Bros. Or pigeot
Kingler! He has the best rating out of all his Pokémon. No training and immediately defeats 3 in a row in a highly ranked game.
Shiny Noctowl because it is cool and shiny
Where TF is butterfree
Fuck bring em all back, and rotate the teams based on who he's fighting. If whomever he face has never faced a particular set of mons before, then use that team against them.
Bulbasaur and Infernape. Maybe even Gible if Ash would evolve it
GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR. GLISCOR.

My boy boldore or snivy
honestly i think he should use muk again
\#Justice4Torterra
They should create a Pokémon with the ability to randomly summon any of your other pokémon and take their place until the enemy pokémon is defeated or switched out, even those in storage and those you set free, and have that ability in the anime work to summon ALL OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME.

Instant army.
Anyone else think that swellow sleeping in torterra’s tree thing to be adorable
Wow, Ash really isn’t getting very far with the whole “Catch ‘em all” thing…
Top choices would be Bayleef, Torkoal, Corphish and Donphan
    Torkoal always crying it filled my heart with tenderness, I love how Bayleef was quite hardcore
Well, as a finale of Pokémon journeys, they could make Ash visit every region in order, starting at Professor Oak and taking all his Pokémon with him. Then, he chills with the team of that region in that region and meets all his friends and people of that time again. When he moves to the next region, he switches to the Pokémon of that region as well.

That aside, since they even brought Gekkouga back, they also could show Goodra again.

Since they already did it with his Pokémon as we can see in the picture you posted, I want them to also show Serena, the people of Alola and Goodra again (and everyone else). It makes no sense for Serena not watching his fights, same goes for Alola and Goodra even has a TV in their home where they watched the XYZ liga on.
None. At this point honestly, I'd love to see this series come to an end, with a new series and new protagonist starting after. Without a Pikachu.
all of them
Charizard snorlax and sceptile
What is this image from?
I would like to see Pikachu
Evolve the Gible
He should fully evolve gible
Noivern is one of my favorite pokemon, and also pretty strong
why is Noctowl so damn big?
I want him to use professor oak or the mom
Bulbasaur and Charizard.

If we can get Squirtle back, I'd be even happier.
zard, torterra, gliscor, sceptile, snorlax, heracross ☺️
Ash-Greninja
Snorlax I just love him so much
Pikachu
Snorlax!😴😅
I wanna see ash rock this team in a league battle;
Charizard, Torterra, Noivern, Snorlax, Kingler, Heracross
Greninja [yes, I am cringe]
Where is this image from???? Did I miss a fucking pokemon watch party???
Reunion special with Squirtle, Pidgeot, Butterfree, Lapras, Greninja, ...holy crap this would be a long list actually.

How about Squirtle!
Infernape and Torterra!
Buizel, Bayleef, Torterra and Gible
Sceptile 
Infernape 
Leavanny 
Kingler 
Hawlucha 
Gliscor
Pikachu
Why are they all watching TV on such a small screen
It would be cool if Ash went around the regions traveling as the World Champ with the purpose of evolving his old Pokemon. Easy way to bring back some old favorites and cameos. Helps his journey of being a pokemon master.
Bayleef, she loved him so much 😪
pikachu
Quilava
Butterfree
Didn't he have like over 20 Taurus or something lol or is my memory wack
TOTODILE!
Primeape and Palpitoad.
This guy needs to evolve his mons I’m tired of him going a whole season with the same first evolution Pokémon.
I want to see some muk action....
Pikachu
Pikachu
Definitely pikachu
Pikachu
Pikachu
Fucking Pikachu deserves more screen time
Probably pikachu tbh
Has he used Pikachu? I'd say that one.
i want something similar to sinnoh elite 4 where they all come back, even if it’s just for a tiny little re-appearance, solely for nostalgia’s sake and they get a chance to show cross-season friendships made (like swellow and torterra seem to have in the posted picture) and maybe give an older pokemon a chance to evolve or shine in the spotlight again
Pikachu
Noctowl is 6 feet tall????
Pikachu
Swellow so Pikachu and it can do another lightning armor move and throw the entire community into a frenzy again.
Torterra, Talonflame, Kingler, Melmetal, Heracross and Pikachu would be a fun 6 party squad to see.
Tauros no#15 was a real mvp
A ghost type or psychic type
Rollypolly elephant 🐘 boy and Crab 🦀
Any and all nfe mons. Evolve the damn Gible already!
Pikachu, Dragonite, Lucario, Gengar, Charizard, and Sceptile. Maybe Snorlax as an alternative. I think that would be a good team.
Charizard, something like the articuno round would be pretty cool
Holy crap, Gliscor is huge
Pikachu. He never uses him.
My boy has like 9 flying types
Gliscor for sure
shoe
To be honest I want to see leavanny come back just so I can see it in action again
Pikachu
Easy one. Pikachu
He can use me🥵🥵🥵😫😫😫
Ash greninja sceptile charizard gliscar gible if he can evolve it into garchomp and krookadile
all the ones he didnt evolve yet. whats taking him so long?
Kingler, Muk, Totodile...
grenninja
His fully evolved ones. Idk how he manages to get through anything comp.
Quilava needs some more love be cool if used quilava again
My man Kingler!! Or Muk would be fun to see as well against a fairy type trainer.
Pidgeot 🥲
Snivy
Snivy
Snivy

Snivy
Blaziken, where ever the hell he is.
Noivern
Hmm. He doesn't have that many pokemon. I always thought he had more.
Pikachu
LMAO. good one. I remember that episode
    Was banned for a while so back when i was a kid we were like "wtf where do those tauros come from?" xD
        During the banned Safari Zone Ep. (It had guns) whenever Ash threw one of his 30 safari balls, a Tauros ran by the pokemon he intended to catch. x30
            Kinda hilarious the episodes with guns are banned in the US.

The irony!
                We can't have an adult pointing a gun at Ash's head in a kids show.
                    But somehow the squirtle episode with bazooka passed
                        Bazookas and lazer weapons are considered over the top and less likely (or impossible) a kid will be able to get their hands on it. Therefore being kid friendly
                            Fun fact:  
Batman: The Animated Series fought tooth and nail for the permission to have real guns in their cartoon show. Spider-Man: The Animated Series did not, and only had laser guns (and no punching, too aggressive; only kicks allowed).
                                There was one episode of Spider-Man: The Animated Series that had a real gun. One of the side characters, I forget which one, found his son hiding it and had to chew him out. The showrunner said he felt it was important that it be a recognizable weapon to help get the message across. 

He said he didn't have to fight much for it to be in, that by not constantly fighting the censorship the people in charge were a lot more agreeable when there was something he wanted.
                    But the Growlth police academy was allowed
                        You could argue that it’s a training prop not a real gun.

But also that’s a stupid argument.
                        Can't pass up that sweet copaganda!
                Hard to understand if you weren’t a kid at the time. Media was in a rampage about child gun safety, every news station in the country was running a bimonthly segment where they would gather up local kids and put them in a play room where they had hidden unloaded guns and then air their reactions when they found them. It was kind of wild.
            Wait that's why he has so many?

That's fucking hilarious
        Oh it's still banned. That episode is most likely never being released outside of Japan.
            I have the comic so I remember. It's a shame really,  you get to see dragonair.


Also episode where James has boobs..I was very confused.
HAHAHA Only one :(
    They've regularly used a single Tauros as a stand-in for the herd. We've still seen the herd stampeding around the fields at the lab a few times over the years.

Likely that one Tauros is the one Ash used during the Indigo League.
        Ash didn’t use a Tauros in the Indigo league. The first time he actually use one was against Drake in the Orange league
            And he won that league, that's not  a coincidence!
            That's right, it was so long ago I mixed them up
        It wouldn't surprise me if he only still owned the one he used in battle and the rest he donated to the ranch
    i second the 40 tauros at once!
        I third it!
I just burst out laughing imagining Ash with 40 Hyper Beam/Blizzard/Body Slam/Earthquake spamming Tauros and just sweeping through the entire league
Lmao
I'm so glad this was the top comment, because it was my first thought
Ash can only use 6 of them
    And who’s gonna stop him from bringing all 30 of them?
    Tauros now learned Horde Stampede to get around that.
we all want it back
    Don’t forget pidgeot
        Ash forgot Pidgeot 😅
            Don't be an ash. Go get your pokemon from the PC every once in a while.
                I used to teach all the pokemon i caught that i knew i wasn't going to use a spare hm and swap them around as needed every so often so i could pretend i was letting them stretch their legs.
    I third this
    Can we at least get an episode about how it is doing these days? Please, Mr./Mrs.Pokemon-Anime-people
I wanna see Pigeot or Primeape :'(
    Primeape was such a tease. Ash only had it for like 3 episodes and only used it in the final episode before giving it away to train.
    If the leaks are real and >!Primeape is getting an evolution!< \- assuming Ash returns as Gen 9 protagonist there's no way it's not returning. >!None of Ash's other pokemon ever got cross-gen evos except for Aipom, who didn't evolve until traded to Dawn and Gligar, which he caught in the gen its evolution was introduced in.!<
        I think they only introduced Aipom in the anime because of Ambipom being a thing. 

It's first episode was quite near to the release of Gen IV.
            There were Aipom in the second movie I think.
                I'm talking about Ash's Aipom
                Not the species as a whole, but the one Aipom that followed Ash.
                Detective pikachu loves aipom
        primeape has been gone for 20+ years it’s just never coming back
            Primeape is still the P1 champion of my heart
                I saw this episode when it aired in 1998. It took me 24 years, but I am just realizing the "P1" is in fact a reference to the NJPW G1 Climax and "Anthony" is a stand-in for Antonio Inoki.
                Considering how much the anime art style has changed I kinda want to see that guy in the modern style
        Also Ash's Cyndaquil evolved into Quilava outside of Johto seasons. I wanna say it evolved around D/P  and that evolution line didn't have any special evolution or variant until Legends: Arceus. So it doesn't necessarily have to strictly follow the trend
            Yes It evolved at the DP Sinnoh league. That was the same generation we got HGSS maybe a coincidence maybe not
                No, likely because using a Cyndaquil in your league battle is inane.
        Not true. Pidgeot got a mega. Sadly never returned
            And Butterfree got a Gigantamax form and didn't return either
        If that’s true then they would have brought back pidgeot with mega evolutions. I mean they didn’t even give his charzard and chance to mega evolve and everyone loves him.
    This man’s Primeape won the Heavyweight Champion of the World title belt and he immediately gives him up. Where does it end, Ash?!
If he's anything like real butterflies he's dead.
    Considering he's got 4 legs instead of 6, let's hope there's something different to his physiology lol
    Nobody ages in this show. Quick evolutions only
        I've seen how they'd draw an adult Ash. This is a kindness.
Did pidgeot came back?
    No
        Pidgeot was someone’s Christmas dinner
            mine
                That explains why it's not in the picture
Why do you have to hurt me this way....
omg yeeees please :(((
Dub edit. The original never mentioned returning. Same with Pidgeot.
Has any of his Pokémon come back after a while?
    [deleted]
        Charizard was never actually released, he left it at a training grounds and brought it back regularly for important battles. Take note of it being in this screenshot.
    Of his permanently released Pokemon (Butterfree, Pidgeot, Lapras, Goodra, Greninja, Poipole) none have returned to his team. Lapras and Greninja got cameo episodes in Johto and Journeys respectively.
I would have liked more input from him, but I think the writers love Ash's fire-type starters😭
    There were many op grass type starter as we like sceptile, rowlet(it's different thing that writers chosed not to evolve it), snivy(ah,..even she didn't evolved), atleast chikorita evolved

P.s.: and yes how can you forget the legendary bulbsaur 
>!even he didn't evolved, cause it ~~makers~~ his choice!<
        Grovyle was amazing, one of my favorites and his battles in the Sinnoh league are memorable
            **I would like to see Pikachu**
        They kept with bayleaf because they knew it was cooler than meganium
            It's not, you folks just hate flowers.
                I love meganiums design, but I do prefer bayleafs by a pretty wide margin. It's why I've always wanted the johot starters to get megas, I feel like with a little bit extra meganiums design could really well blossom
                    Bayleef always struck me as just edgy Chikorita, one of those middle evolutions that changes so little I might have forgotten it if not for the anime. Meganium is more cute than ferocious but I definitely like its flower collar better than the seed/joint beads, and the pistil antennas are a clever take.

Though I definitely would have liked a Mega, not only for a fancier look but also because Mega Meganium sounds pretty funny.
                        I always thought it was one of the more natural looking middle evolutions. That didn't look to different or edgy.
                    Hah, blossom. It has flowers. Puns.
                I think Chikorita and Bayleef's head-leaf-scythe sounds more interesting to see in action, and perhaps the show's writers/animators thought that, too
A grass earth type lose to an elec type is unforgivable
    Yeah I was gonna say what the fuck were the writers smoking lol
        Electivire ice punch, 4x super effective against torterra
            I know the anime doesn’t follow the same rules as competitive, but my headcalc says Torterra takes 85% and OHKOs with EQ   
Edit: 252+ Atk Life Orb Electivire Ice Punch vs. 248 HP / 252+ Def Torterra: 317-374 (80.6 - 95.1%) I was right, but only bulky Torterra.
        Ash's Charizard beats Gary's Blastoise then lost to a Blaziken the next episode. That pissed off 10 year old me and slightly annoys adult me. 

The writers just do whatever they want.
            Welcome to the Pokémon anime where moves are made up and the types don’t matter
    Don't forget hippowdon is ground, which as we know is weak to grass
Was literally about to say this. For my 2jd favourite pokemon it got shafted so hard, especially when it's such a cool pokemon.

But unfortunately it gets put into the brute archetype, where the big tough guy is always taken down first to show off the threat.
    Like I got no clue why it couldn’t have got the glory of taking down Paul’s Drapion….
        Or Bertha’s Hippowdown...

Or Volkner’s Electivire...
            Especially the electivire with that type advantage
                So true, and i remember how he would ALWAYS think he had an opportunity to finish off the opposing mon with Rock climb (annoying how he doesnt have any ground moves on his Torterra btw) just for the opponent to easily block or counter the attack and then finish it off..
            At least it should have beaten Hippowdon
            Bertha was an elite 4 duh, ofc ash was gonna lose to her
Sidenote: I love Swellow just chilling on Torterra
[deleted]
    Didnt goodra have a 100% winrate?
        It did until the Pokémon League
        It did until Alains Bisharp…
        [deleted]
            Ash’s Goodra sucks. Literally why he lost the Kalos League and because he made dogshit decisions in that much (Noivern against a fucking Weavile)
                To be fair, this is in the same league where a fucking Pikachu took down a Tyranitar and a Metagross in the same match. The anime does not play by the game rules lmao
                    Greninja did so bad in that match ffs
    So we know he is a hyper offence player
    I thought his Snorlax had some good W-L ratios.
How about Incineroar? It never even got a single battle after evolving.
    Sure BUT it beat Kukui’s beast mon… the evolved version of itself… like it got the credit it deserved
That’s my thing, I wanna watch Torterra eat an energy ball, get overpowered, and reck some mons
    Ground is my fav type. How the hell did it lose to Electivire?!
        Electivire must've went for the horns
It lost to a bloody Hippodown? A Grass type lost to a Ground type!? Yikes.
    Also lost to electivire who was electric and Drapion who was poison, so he had type advantage on all of them
    all three of those were good type MUs lol
Still wild how it loses 3 battles where it has the type advantage.
Torterra's arc was about struggling from going from a fast and agile Turtwig, to a slow and clunky Torterra, and just kinda accepting it. Torterra can learn Rock polish, he doesn't need to be slow, just needs help learning a new move. Massive oversight. As much as I like Infernape's arc, Torterra deserved more.
Yeah, it lost to an electric-type.  The Grass/**Ground** type lost to an electric type.  Should’ve been an easy W, and the anime just said “fuck it.”
    Guess type match ups aren't as important in the anime. I think I prefer that tbh.
        I don’t recall the match exactly, but the only excusable reason is if Electivire used Ice Punch.
            Nah for me the show not being as strict as the games makes it more interesting
They must have forgot how big Ash’s Noctowl is. Back in Johto it was originally shown as smaller than a normal one
    Yeah. It was chilling on his shoulder on occasion.
    It looks like a lot of his pokemon have grown in this pic. His gen 1 and 2 pokemon look consistently bigger.
        I think they initially went by the in-game heights of Pokémon, which make no fucking sense (Charizard is supposed to be 5'7 tall, smaller than your average adult male). Now they just give them all logical sizes instead.
Swellow is letting him know what's going on.
    "Shall I describe it to you, or would you like me to find you a box?"
Charizard are canonically only supposed to be 5~6 feet tall, so this image probably shouldn’t be taken as gospel.
    
    Charizard is an alpha because of charific valley that had nothing but alpha charizards
i mean imagine if he caught a furret, he would have someone towering above them all
> Noctowl are gigantic.

his Noctowl is actually smaller than a regular Noctowl! so imagine that
Love it, But first you have to wake him up 😩
    Give him Sleep Talk obviously
        Sure, just as soon as he wakes up
    The Majin Buu of Pokemon
    ZzZzZzZzZz
Isn't Snorlax statistically Ash's true ace Pokemon? If memory serves me correctly that thing might as well have been a legendary Pokemon in the show.
    Everytime he went to battle, he brought at least one W.
    The fact that it used 6 moves proves its a true legendary.
The Snorlax story line was always one of my favourites
Coooookiiiieeee
P sure he has the best win rate of any of ash’s mons
    Ash had never even seen it battle yet because he caught it after fighting it with a stick, and he still showed up, evolved, and swept a team by itself. And then was never used again.
        [deleted]
            Perfect IV and Chad
                Before we even knew what IV's were.
                    It had perfect DVs.
            Based
        Minor correction: Kingler was actually used in the Whirl Cup in Johto. I don’t remember how many times, but I definitely remember it destroying Misty’s Poliwhirl with Crabhammer and then using Vice Grip on Psyduck and getting absolutely wrecked.
            The only bit that I remember from the Orange Island episodes is the Crystal Onix and Misty's Psyduck evolving, so kudos to you for having that kind of memory.
                Fake evolving, but yeah, the moment was so prominent to me because Ash KNOWS that Psyduck is boss when he gets a headache, so what does he do? Uses a claw to squeeze and cause a huge headache, and he was super cocky doing it, too. Just…the worst tactics.
        Ash found the one Krabby that came to earth as a baby from Planet Krypton and benches him for 25 years.
    Kingler is actually #18.

https://www.deviantart.com/pkmnmasterwheeler/art/Ash-s-Pokemon-Win-Percentages-Kanto-Alola-864961647
    Don't forget greninja
Kingler started my love of the ClampsTM pokemon. Guillotine wiped out my rival's Charizard in the elite 4 in my first playthrough, was awesome.
Kingler truly was the most crab.
1v3’d the first mook in the Indigo Conference. Shit must’ve been embarrassing for the other dude, losing to a 10 year-old with a Pokémon he never used up until this point…
    Such an iconic anime moment though.
thats what i was going to say, kingler didnt take bait from anyone.
I started a new playthrough in blue just to try out Kingler after it’s performance in the Orange League. To this day it’s been my best performing Pokémon. It could withstand 2 thunders from a higher level electric type easily.
My favorite one!!
Krookodile is fully evolved if that makes you feel any better.
Didn't his tepig fully evolve?
    It is still a Pignite as of now.
        You’d think with Ash’s track record of Fire starters with sad backstories that it would’ve evolved and become one of his powerhouses but nope after beating it’s old trainer it just fucked off and that’s despite it training under his own Charizard
            Bianca had Emboar, and they don't usually fully evolve the same starter twice in the same series
                >Paul’s Torterra & Ash’s Torterra

>Kenny’s Empoleon & Barry’s Empoleon

>Ash’s Incineroar & Kukui’s Incineroar

Trust me I don’t think that’s holding them back
Unova never happened. What are you talking about?
Did he ever acknowledge it was shiny? Does ash actually know he has a pretty rare mon? Lol. IIRC someone asked him once why it sparkled and his response was basically “oh yeah it does that sometimes.”
    Yeah they addressed that in the episode it was introduced. It was called a Pokemon of a different colour or something
        Ash also mentioned that its shiny (he didn't use the word shiny) in the diamon and pearl series.
    "It do be like that." *Nods.*
I appreciate that he only has one shiny. They tend to do a good job of making shinies special.
He has a shiny??
    I think his Noctowl is shiny
    the noctowol
\- Squirtle   
\- Bulbasaur  
\- Charizard  
\- Snorlax  
\- Lapras  
If this is Ash's final bout, lets make it official and bring them back to join Pikachu and make the Red team we all know and love.
Is that why it's massive??

I swear it was smaller than others
    Lol turns out he had a shiny alpha
Ash's Noctowl is Shiny is bigger than the others, something like that I remember from the episode
    Funny, I remember it being smaller than the non shiny. 🤷🏻‍♂️
    It was actually smaller than the rest but in Journeys it grew to the normal size of its species
        So Noctowl grows but Ash doesn't...
            Reminder that Ash left Alola while Kukui's wife was pregnant and in journeys he cameback and the baby already born.
                Dialga must be drinking on the job or something.
                So at least 9 months have passed in the world...
🤣🤣🤣
                Also there was an episode where Ash is reunited with Lapras and it is also grown taller to the point Ash doesn't recognise it at first...
            My headcanon is that Professor Oak is studying how bonds develop between pokemon and trainers, and Ash and Pikachu are his subjects. Every new league is a new clone of Ash and Pikachu, with the memories of the previous. It explains why Ash never ages and Pikachu seems to fluctuate in strength. Jennys and Joys are clones too, commonly used because they bond well with pokemon suited to law enforcement/healing.
    Its weird seeing them in scale, gliscar is bigger than I thought and Donphan is smaller than I pictured.
    I mean that tracks. Have you ever seen an owl in person? I had one in my yard a couple months ago and was blown away by how big they are
Noctowls are bigger than staraptors in general. Like over a foot taller.
That’s an error. Noctowl was noticeably shorter than Bayleef in the episode where Team Rocket stole Ash’s Johto badges.

[source](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemon/images/4/47/GS139_11.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20140810213727)
It also has more attack than the god Pokémon
Huh?

It lost to Arcanine in a later battle.
    Oh, thnx. I haven’t watched the full series, but I’m glad Ash at least brought him out once more
        He also used it in the Whirl Islands to battle Misty!
The chaos of the first pokemon league was something cool i wish they did in the other ones, maybe it does i don't watch much of them but ash completely switching up his team with these random pokes he caught a long the way and they end up being great was cool.
Didn’t it also crack open a Cloyster with Crabhammer?
Tantor! Tantor!
    Happy birthday Ivan. -sobs-
        He was our beloved son! HE WILL NOT BE MISSED!!!! *CRIES IN CORNER*
THEY TAKE EVERYONE BUT MR STAKE!
    That crit ice beam leaving it with 4hp and came out of confusion was the single greatest nuzlocke moment of all of them in my opinion
Upvote for team four star
Bellsprout - 0
Muk - 1
    Get fucking slimed
haha i love it
Definitely Muk!
    “Good luck with Muk and Poison Gas

Make one wrong move and it’ll kick your grass!”
        Which is funny because there's only one grass Pokemon that poison is super effective against in Gen 1 and that's Tangela. So really, it wouldn't kick your grass when that song was created
            Technically paras & parasect were as well. Poison was SE against bug in Gen 1, which is why the paras line is the only Pokémon to ever have 3 4x weaknesses
I always love how affectionate they made Muk after Ash caught it.  Horrible smelling pile of goo, but it just wants hugs.
    It stared out all scary and once he caught it, it acted like one of those big dogs that always wants to sit on your lap lol
Muk is unironically one of my favorite pokemon.
One of my favourite moments is when Ash brings back Sceptile to fight Darkrai and becomes the first pokemon to beat it. Sceptile was probably one of my favourite mons, both in game and in anime. But then again I was also pissed when it got owned by the Latios immediately after
In all fairness, they producers would only bring back Charizard, because big orange dragon
    I remember an episode where they brought back Cyndaquil I think, after years and years, and he evolved and it was so fuckin HYPE
    But if you think about it, and actually use some reasoning, and check the mathematics behind it, big orange dragon.
        Correct, Dragonite is indeed a big orange dragon.
    Thing is they don't even bring Charizard back in any meaningful capacity any more. Charizard the species still gets plenty of screentime through trainers like Alain and Leon, but Ash's Charizard itself (who by the way is probably responsible for like 90% of that Pokemon's popularity) only really gets cameos at Oak's lab and one fanservice-y return in Black and White after Battle Frontier.
well hey phanpy did come back after hoenn and became a part of the team, even going as far as to evolve and then participate in the sinnoh league
    They were better with it earlier but from BW onwards, the older Pokemon never really got appearances like that again outside small cameos at Oak's
Especially this season.

I'd have been happy if he just caught one and kept going back to his buddies.
That’s because the show is an advertisement for the new generation and a gateway to get kids into the franchise. It’s not meant to be a continuous story that you follow.
    It's less relevant this season as they did a really bad job introducing the new generation anyway.
    That is the root of the issue, yes, but even with that in mind, I can't help but feel this show needlessly spurns a lot of opportunities with regards to continuity, especially post-DP (the current series is a glaring example of this)
He’s less valuable than 29 Tauros
Plot twist. He's actually one of Ash's Pokemon
Chairs are for Ash's parents
Has Noivern ever won a single match-up? It deserves a shot at redemption
    Ash's Noivern fought a great fight against Zapdos right after it evolved. I feel like they couldve been used more, and was done a disservice by Ash for being put up against a part ice type in his battle against Alain
Not for now, would you choose it?
    *Hell yeah*
Noivern is my favorite Pokemon of all time, so yes, id love to them return
I think Snorlax is a Pokémon that will go down in the history books, its strength and strategies are interesting
His Snorlac has ice punch too, right? Great coverage move.
Ash's Heracross is too Op, I remember that since he caught it in the anime I was looking for it in all the games and I managed it in some, I remember that in the 4th gen it is too tedious to look for it in The trees with honey😩
    Too op they decided to never use him In a gym battle. Ash could’ve beat Whitney first try with him
    In hg/ss you can just keep using headbutt on regular trees in certain areas, I caught my heracross in azalea town
Heracross is the correct answer here. Also I find it funny that Taillow is chilling on top of Torterra’s tree in the photo.
Anime Heracross is what caught my attention and wanted to try it out in the games. Now it’s byFAR my favorite Pokémon. It’s so dang good. Just keep birds away.
I remember when Ash brought his Sleep Talk Heracross to counter Tobias's Darkrai.  Considering the type advantage also that was the most big brained move I've seen him pull at the time.
Heracross for the fucking win
Yep same heracross would be my pick
I love that it sounds like Donald Duck
    I loved his personality and how hyper he was on Ash's journey. Really made him stand out and easily made him a fan-favourite. Would love that excitement on Ash's team again, even if for just one episode.
        He is energetic and cute, I would have liked to see how much he could exploit his potential, I feel that Feraligatr, in addition to having a huge butt, is too cute and I still imagine him doing like a duck😩
Mine too! I love totodile so much I wish he got more support.
I feel like they have so much more to offer
I prefer Tauros No. 13
what about 17?
Tauros No. 6 is a bit sassy, but boy does it run
Wrong, No. 9 is where it's at obviously
Tauros No. 18 makes Tauros No. 22 look like Tauros No. 7.
Hahaha, I would give battle to his Garchomp without a doubt
Haha love it, one of my choices
Bring him back evolved and with a wife and kids. Lil dudes been working a job for 20 years unlike the rest of those broke ass pokefuckers living of pokefare.
It is also one of my favorite leagues, because it uses the old ones and although it ruined it by putting Torkoal, many did an incredible job like Heracross or Grovyle
The animation studio are as incompetent as GameFreak is with the games. They genuinely don't understand how to write compelling stories other than copy and pasting memorable ones we've seen before. IE, Gengar's story is just Charmander's again, Butterfree literally had a duplicate with the exact same story, etc.

For Journeys being about "Gen 8" it sure comes across that not even the anime team gives two fucks about that Gen just as much as GameFreak didn't.

Journeys should've been a celebration of 25 years with Ash recalling reserves partnered with his new team to teach them battling over the series. That way by the time the Masters 8 rolls around Ash wouldn't need reserves anymore and we could see his Journeys team finally come together for the first time as the Championship caliber team it should be.

And yet... lol. Here we are.
    Well when they expect viewers to drop the show after 2 seasons they really don't have much of a reason to care about recycling plots. Especially when Ash has been around for so long that he has nowhere else to go as a character.
        older fans don't care about new arcs and new fans don't care about old ones, so no one cares about recycling stuff lol
😥
#justice4pidgeot
You and me both
He should have brought Sceptile to fight Steven and Infernape against Cynthia
    Honestly he could have just brought the lucario he has on him, mega him, and swept Stevens whole team . Kinda wish they saved pikachus z move for later in the tourney
Primape He hit even Ash, he can with Cynthia team without problem
That would be OP.
butterfree
I'm more annoyed that he only used it in one battle.
We all know the REAL reason why he took it away
    Lmao oh nooooooooooo
Charizard beat a legendary before his training ended
    He edged Articuno, who was wild. The real time weve seen Charizard's training super pay off is against Iris Dragonite.
This. It's sad Charizard only had 1 serious battle after he finished training, and it was interrupted before he could finish Dragonite off. 

If this is it for Ash, it will be a big waste not to give Charizard one last important battle. What I wouldn't give to see the OG ace have his last dance.
Squirtle was the one I was thinking. What a cool dude.
    Squirtle was no slouch, he’s definitely ash’s strongest water starter after Greninja, and I’d say his third strongest water type after Greninja and Dracovish
exactly in that order
It is one of my favorite regional birds, an incredible design and a wonderful speed and attack, along with Staraptor
AH, A FELLOW MAN OF CULTURE
    Very jealous of your username! Spread the good word of Bulbasaur my friend!
\- Squirtle   
\- Bulbasaur  
\- Charizard  
\- Snorlax  
\- Lapras  
If this is Ash's final bout, lets make it official and bring them back to join Pikachu and make the Red team we all know and love.
I thought bulbasaur didn’t want to evolve
    And squirtle is too cute to evolve
        Come to think of it, is squirtle in this picture?
            I think it’s off with the Squritle squad.
    If I remember right, yeah, it didn’t want to evolve when all the other Bulbasaur were evolving into Ivysaur. But we never knew why it didn’t want to. Maybe it didn’t like peer pressure? Or it wanted to prove itself as a Bulbasaur before evolving. Point is, Ash should have figured out that reason and tried to help him overcome it so it could become Venusaur and be a real asset to his team.
        > so it could become Venusaur and be a real asset to his team.


Implying it wasn't?!
            For real, in the first several arcs, Bulbasaur is one of Ash's biggest ringers, right up there with Pikachu.

The series is pretty inconsistent in canon with the notion that evolved Pokémon are superior to their precursors.
                Bulbasaur is also the Pokémon which Ash carried with hin for the second most time. Only Pokémon with more episodes is ofc Pikachu.
Haha, I said pokemon not boyfriend
I feel like it's more likely to come back
    yeah especially with the part where lucario and ash unlocked battle bond
Plot twist: Ash chooses something else, Oshawott shows up like it always used to
It would be perfect in his new team

Do you think she already has little Charmanders?
    Charizard is a she?
        no, but possibly he met a charizard in charizard village and they had beautiful charmanders
            >charizard village

Is charizard no longer staying at the Charcific Valley?
is the most likely to return
i still miss him
Butterfree😭😭😭
It also took a Fishous Rend from Dracovish, so it wasn't a one hit KO.
Torkoal always crying it filled my heart with tenderness, I love how Bayleef was quite hardcore
Was banned for a while so back when i was a kid we were like "wtf where do those tauros come from?" xD
    During the banned Safari Zone Ep. (It had guns) whenever Ash threw one of his 30 safari balls, a Tauros ran by the pokemon he intended to catch. x30
        Kinda hilarious the episodes with guns are banned in the US.

The irony!
            We can't have an adult pointing a gun at Ash's head in a kids show.
                But somehow the squirtle episode with bazooka passed
                    Bazookas and lazer weapons are considered over the top and less likely (or impossible) a kid will be able to get their hands on it. Therefore being kid friendly
                        Fun fact:  
Batman: The Animated Series fought tooth and nail for the permission to have real guns in their cartoon show. Spider-Man: The Animated Series did not, and only had laser guns (and no punching, too aggressive; only kicks allowed).
                            There was one episode of Spider-Man: The Animated Series that had a real gun. One of the side characters, I forget which one, found his son hiding it and had to chew him out. The showrunner said he felt it was important that it be a recognizable weapon to help get the message across. 

He said he didn't have to fight much for it to be in, that by not constantly fighting the censorship the people in charge were a lot more agreeable when there was something he wanted.
                But the Growlth police academy was allowed
                    You could argue that it’s a training prop not a real gun.

But also that’s a stupid argument.
                    Can't pass up that sweet copaganda!
            Hard to understand if you weren’t a kid at the time. Media was in a rampage about child gun safety, every news station in the country was running a bimonthly segment where they would gather up local kids and put them in a play room where they had hidden unloaded guns and then air their reactions when they found them. It was kind of wild.
        Wait that's why he has so many?

That's fucking hilarious
    Oh it's still banned. That episode is most likely never being released outside of Japan.
        I have the comic so I remember. It's a shame really,  you get to see dragonair.


Also episode where James has boobs..I was very confused.
They've regularly used a single Tauros as a stand-in for the herd. We've still seen the herd stampeding around the fields at the lab a few times over the years.

Likely that one Tauros is the one Ash used during the Indigo League.
    Ash didn’t use a Tauros in the Indigo league. The first time he actually use one was against Drake in the Orange league
        And he won that league, that's not  a coincidence!
        That's right, it was so long ago I mixed them up
    It wouldn't surprise me if he only still owned the one he used in battle and the rest he donated to the ranch
i second the 40 tauros at once!
    I third it!
And who’s gonna stop him from bringing all 30 of them?
Tauros now learned Horde Stampede to get around that.
Don’t forget pidgeot
    Ash forgot Pidgeot 😅
        Don't be an ash. Go get your pokemon from the PC every once in a while.
            I used to teach all the pokemon i caught that i knew i wasn't going to use a spare hm and swap them around as needed every so often so i could pretend i was letting them stretch their legs.
I third this
Can we at least get an episode about how it is doing these days? Please, Mr./Mrs.Pokemon-Anime-people
Primeape was such a tease. Ash only had it for like 3 episodes and only used it in the final episode before giving it away to train.
If the leaks are real and >!Primeape is getting an evolution!< \- assuming Ash returns as Gen 9 protagonist there's no way it's not returning. >!None of Ash's other pokemon ever got cross-gen evos except for Aipom, who didn't evolve until traded to Dawn and Gligar, which he caught in the gen its evolution was introduced in.!<
    I think they only introduced Aipom in the anime because of Ambipom being a thing. 

It's first episode was quite near to the release of Gen IV.
        There were Aipom in the second movie I think.
            I'm talking about Ash's Aipom
            Not the species as a whole, but the one Aipom that followed Ash.
            Detective pikachu loves aipom
    primeape has been gone for 20+ years it’s just never coming back
        Primeape is still the P1 champion of my heart
            I saw this episode when it aired in 1998. It took me 24 years, but I am just realizing the "P1" is in fact a reference to the NJPW G1 Climax and "Anthony" is a stand-in for Antonio Inoki.
            Considering how much the anime art style has changed I kinda want to see that guy in the modern style
    Also Ash's Cyndaquil evolved into Quilava outside of Johto seasons. I wanna say it evolved around D/P  and that evolution line didn't have any special evolution or variant until Legends: Arceus. So it doesn't necessarily have to strictly follow the trend
        Yes It evolved at the DP Sinnoh league. That was the same generation we got HGSS maybe a coincidence maybe not
            No, likely because using a Cyndaquil in your league battle is inane.
    Not true. Pidgeot got a mega. Sadly never returned
        And Butterfree got a Gigantamax form and didn't return either
    If that’s true then they would have brought back pidgeot with mega evolutions. I mean they didn’t even give his charzard and chance to mega evolve and everyone loves him.
This man’s Primeape won the Heavyweight Champion of the World title belt and he immediately gives him up. Where does it end, Ash?!
Considering he's got 4 legs instead of 6, let's hope there's something different to his physiology lol
Nobody ages in this show. Quick evolutions only
    I've seen how they'd draw an adult Ash. This is a kindness.
No
    Pidgeot was someone’s Christmas dinner
        mine
            That explains why it's not in the picture
[deleted]
    Charizard was never actually released, he left it at a training grounds and brought it back regularly for important battles. Take note of it being in this screenshot.
Of his permanently released Pokemon (Butterfree, Pidgeot, Lapras, Goodra, Greninja, Poipole) none have returned to his team. Lapras and Greninja got cameo episodes in Johto and Journeys respectively.
There were many op grass type starter as we like sceptile, rowlet(it's different thing that writers chosed not to evolve it), snivy(ah,..even she didn't evolved), atleast chikorita evolved

P.s.: and yes how can you forget the legendary bulbsaur 
>!even he didn't evolved, cause it ~~makers~~ his choice!<
    Grovyle was amazing, one of my favorites and his battles in the Sinnoh league are memorable
        **I would like to see Pikachu**
    They kept with bayleaf because they knew it was cooler than meganium
        It's not, you folks just hate flowers.
            I love meganiums design, but I do prefer bayleafs by a pretty wide margin. It's why I've always wanted the johot starters to get megas, I feel like with a little bit extra meganiums design could really well blossom
                Bayleef always struck me as just edgy Chikorita, one of those middle evolutions that changes so little I might have forgotten it if not for the anime. Meganium is more cute than ferocious but I definitely like its flower collar better than the seed/joint beads, and the pistil antennas are a clever take.

Though I definitely would have liked a Mega, not only for a fancier look but also because Mega Meganium sounds pretty funny.
                    I always thought it was one of the more natural looking middle evolutions. That didn't look to different or edgy.
                Hah, blossom. It has flowers. Puns.
            I think Chikorita and Bayleef's head-leaf-scythe sounds more interesting to see in action, and perhaps the show's writers/animators thought that, too
Yeah I was gonna say what the fuck were the writers smoking lol
    Electivire ice punch, 4x super effective against torterra
        I know the anime doesn’t follow the same rules as competitive, but my headcalc says Torterra takes 85% and OHKOs with EQ   
Edit: 252+ Atk Life Orb Electivire Ice Punch vs. 248 HP / 252+ Def Torterra: 317-374 (80.6 - 95.1%) I was right, but only bulky Torterra.
    Ash's Charizard beats Gary's Blastoise then lost to a Blaziken the next episode. That pissed off 10 year old me and slightly annoys adult me. 

The writers just do whatever they want.
        Welcome to the Pokémon anime where moves are made up and the types don’t matter
Don't forget hippowdon is ground, which as we know is weak to grass
Like I got no clue why it couldn’t have got the glory of taking down Paul’s Drapion….
    Or Bertha’s Hippowdown...

Or Volkner’s Electivire...
        Especially the electivire with that type advantage
            So true, and i remember how he would ALWAYS think he had an opportunity to finish off the opposing mon with Rock climb (annoying how he doesnt have any ground moves on his Torterra btw) just for the opponent to easily block or counter the attack and then finish it off..
        At least it should have beaten Hippowdon
        Bertha was an elite 4 duh, ofc ash was gonna lose to her
Didnt goodra have a 100% winrate?
    It did until the Pokémon League
    It did until Alains Bisharp…
    [deleted]
        Ash’s Goodra sucks. Literally why he lost the Kalos League and because he made dogshit decisions in that much (Noivern against a fucking Weavile)
            To be fair, this is in the same league where a fucking Pikachu took down a Tyranitar and a Metagross in the same match. The anime does not play by the game rules lmao
                Greninja did so bad in that match ffs
So we know he is a hyper offence player
I thought his Snorlax had some good W-L ratios.
Sure BUT it beat Kukui’s beast mon… the evolved version of itself… like it got the credit it deserved
Ground is my fav type. How the hell did it lose to Electivire?!
    Electivire must've went for the horns
Also lost to electivire who was electric and Drapion who was poison, so he had type advantage on all of them
all three of those were good type MUs lol
Guess type match ups aren't as important in the anime. I think I prefer that tbh.
    I don’t recall the match exactly, but the only excusable reason is if Electivire used Ice Punch.
        Nah for me the show not being as strict as the games makes it more interesting
Yeah. It was chilling on his shoulder on occasion.
It looks like a lot of his pokemon have grown in this pic. His gen 1 and 2 pokemon look consistently bigger.
    I think they initially went by the in-game heights of Pokémon, which make no fucking sense (Charizard is supposed to be 5'7 tall, smaller than your average adult male). Now they just give them all logical sizes instead.
"Shall I describe it to you, or would you like me to find you a box?"

Charizard is an alpha because of charific valley that had nothing but alpha charizards
Give him Sleep Talk obviously
    Sure, just as soon as he wakes up
The Majin Buu of Pokemon
ZzZzZzZzZz
Everytime he went to battle, he brought at least one W.
The fact that it used 6 moves proves its a true legendary.
Ash had never even seen it battle yet because he caught it after fighting it with a stick, and he still showed up, evolved, and swept a team by itself. And then was never used again.
    [deleted]
        Perfect IV and Chad
            Before we even knew what IV's were.
                It had perfect DVs.
        Based
    Minor correction: Kingler was actually used in the Whirl Cup in Johto. I don’t remember how many times, but I definitely remember it destroying Misty’s Poliwhirl with Crabhammer and then using Vice Grip on Psyduck and getting absolutely wrecked.
        The only bit that I remember from the Orange Island episodes is the Crystal Onix and Misty's Psyduck evolving, so kudos to you for having that kind of memory.
            Fake evolving, but yeah, the moment was so prominent to me because Ash KNOWS that Psyduck is boss when he gets a headache, so what does he do? Uses a claw to squeeze and cause a huge headache, and he was super cocky doing it, too. Just…the worst tactics.
    Ash found the one Krabby that came to earth as a baby from Planet Krypton and benches him for 25 years.
Kingler is actually #18.

Don't forget greninja
Such an iconic anime moment though.
It is still a Pignite as of now.
    You’d think with Ash’s track record of Fire starters with sad backstories that it would’ve evolved and become one of his powerhouses but nope after beating it’s old trainer it just fucked off and that’s despite it training under his own Charizard
        Bianca had Emboar, and they don't usually fully evolve the same starter twice in the same series
            >Paul’s Torterra & Ash’s Torterra

>Kenny’s Empoleon & Barry’s Empoleon

>Ash’s Incineroar & Kukui’s Incineroar

Trust me I don’t think that’s holding them back
Yeah they addressed that in the episode it was introduced. It was called a Pokemon of a different colour or something
    Ash also mentioned that its shiny (he didn't use the word shiny) in the diamon and pearl series.
"It do be like that." *Nods.*
I think his Noctowl is shiny
the noctowol
Lol turns out he had a shiny alpha
Funny, I remember it being smaller than the non shiny. 🤷🏻‍♂️
It was actually smaller than the rest but in Journeys it grew to the normal size of its species
    So Noctowl grows but Ash doesn't...
        Reminder that Ash left Alola while Kukui's wife was pregnant and in journeys he cameback and the baby already born.
            Dialga must be drinking on the job or something.
            So at least 9 months have passed in the world...
🤣🤣🤣
            Also there was an episode where Ash is reunited with Lapras and it is also grown taller to the point Ash doesn't recognise it at first...
        My headcanon is that Professor Oak is studying how bonds develop between pokemon and trainers, and Ash and Pikachu are his subjects. Every new league is a new clone of Ash and Pikachu, with the memories of the previous. It explains why Ash never ages and Pikachu seems to fluctuate in strength. Jennys and Joys are clones too, commonly used because they bond well with pokemon suited to law enforcement/healing.
Its weird seeing them in scale, gliscar is bigger than I thought and Donphan is smaller than I pictured.
I mean that tracks. Have you ever seen an owl in person? I had one in my yard a couple months ago and was blown away by how big they are
Oh, thnx. I haven’t watched the full series, but I’m glad Ash at least brought him out once more
    He also used it in the Whirl Islands to battle Misty!
Happy birthday Ivan. -sobs-
    He was our beloved son! HE WILL NOT BE MISSED!!!! *CRIES IN CORNER*
That crit ice beam leaving it with 4hp and came out of confusion was the single greatest nuzlocke moment of all of them in my opinion
Get fucking slimed
“Good luck with Muk and Poison Gas

Make one wrong move and it’ll kick your grass!”
    Which is funny because there's only one grass Pokemon that poison is super effective against in Gen 1 and that's Tangela. So really, it wouldn't kick your grass when that song was created
        Technically paras & parasect were as well. Poison was SE against bug in Gen 1, which is why the paras line is the only Pokémon to ever have 3 4x weaknesses
It stared out all scary and once he caught it, it acted like one of those big dogs that always wants to sit on your lap lol
I remember an episode where they brought back Cyndaquil I think, after years and years, and he evolved and it was so fuckin HYPE
But if you think about it, and actually use some reasoning, and check the mathematics behind it, big orange dragon.
    Correct, Dragonite is indeed a big orange dragon.
Thing is they don't even bring Charizard back in any meaningful capacity any more. Charizard the species still gets plenty of screentime through trainers like Alain and Leon, but Ash's Charizard itself (who by the way is probably responsible for like 90% of that Pokemon's popularity) only really gets cameos at Oak's lab and one fanservice-y return in Black and White after Battle Frontier.
They were better with it earlier but from BW onwards, the older Pokemon never really got appearances like that again outside small cameos at Oak's
It's less relevant this season as they did a really bad job introducing the new generation anyway.
That is the root of the issue, yes, but even with that in mind, I can't help but feel this show needlessly spurns a lot of opportunities with regards to continuity, especially post-DP (the current series is a glaring example of this)
Ash's Noivern fought a great fight against Zapdos right after it evolved. I feel like they couldve been used more, and was done a disservice by Ash for being put up against a part ice type in his battle against Alain
*Hell yeah*
Too op they decided to never use him In a gym battle. Ash could’ve beat Whitney first try with him
In hg/ss you can just keep using headbutt on regular trees in certain areas, I caught my heracross in azalea town
I loved his personality and how hyper he was on Ash's journey. Really made him stand out and easily made him a fan-favourite. Would love that excitement on Ash's team again, even if for just one episode.
    He is energetic and cute, I would have liked to see how much he could exploit his potential, I feel that Feraligatr, in addition to having a huge butt, is too cute and I still imagine him doing like a duck😩
Well when they expect viewers to drop the show after 2 seasons they really don't have much of a reason to care about recycling plots. Especially when Ash has been around for so long that he has nowhere else to go as a character.
    older fans don't care about new arcs and new fans don't care about old ones, so no one cares about recycling stuff lol
Honestly he could have just brought the lucario he has on him, mega him, and swept Stevens whole team . Kinda wish they saved pikachus z move for later in the tourney
Lmao oh nooooooooooo
He edged Articuno, who was wild. The real time weve seen Charizard's training super pay off is against Iris Dragonite.
Squirtle was no slouch, he’s definitely ash’s strongest water starter after Greninja, and I’d say his third strongest water type after Greninja and Dracovish
Very jealous of your username! Spread the good word of Bulbasaur my friend!
And squirtle is too cute to evolve
    Come to think of it, is squirtle in this picture?
        I think it’s off with the Squritle squad.
If I remember right, yeah, it didn’t want to evolve when all the other Bulbasaur were evolving into Ivysaur. But we never knew why it didn’t want to. Maybe it didn’t like peer pressure? Or it wanted to prove itself as a Bulbasaur before evolving. Point is, Ash should have figured out that reason and tried to help him overcome it so it could become Venusaur and be a real asset to his team.
    > so it could become Venusaur and be a real asset to his team.


Implying it wasn't?!
        For real, in the first several arcs, Bulbasaur is one of Ash's biggest ringers, right up there with Pikachu.

The series is pretty inconsistent in canon with the notion that evolved Pokémon are superior to their precursors.
            Bulbasaur is also the Pokémon which Ash carried with hin for the second most time. Only Pokémon with more episodes is ofc Pikachu.

Ash's Charizard beats Gary's Blastoise then lost to a Blaziken the next episode. That pissed off 10 year old me and slightly annoys adult me. 

The writers just do whatever they want.
    Welcome to the Pokémon anime where moves are made up and the types don’t matter
Or Bertha’s Hippowdown...

Or Volkner’s Electivire...
    Especially the electivire with that type advantage
        So true, and i remember how he would ALWAYS think he had an opportunity to finish off the opposing mon with Rock climb (annoying how he doesnt have any ground moves on his Torterra btw) just for the opponent to easily block or counter the attack and then finish it off..
    At least it should have beaten Hippowdon
    Bertha was an elite 4 duh, ofc ash was gonna lose to her
It did until the Pokémon League
It did until Alains Bisharp…

    Ash’s Goodra sucks. Literally why he lost the Kalos League and because he made dogshit decisions in that much (Noivern against a fucking Weavile)
        To be fair, this is in the same league where a fucking Pikachu took down a Tyranitar and a Metagross in the same match. The anime does not play by the game rules lmao
            Greninja did so bad in that match ffs
Electivire must've went for the horns
I don’t recall the match exactly, but the only excusable reason is if Electivire used Ice Punch.
    Nah for me the show not being as strict as the games makes it more interesting
I think they initially went by the in-game heights of Pokémon, which make no fucking sense (Charizard is supposed to be 5'7 tall, smaller than your average adult male). Now they just give them all logical sizes instead.
Sure, just as soon as he wakes up

    Perfect IV and Chad
        Before we even knew what IV's were.
            It had perfect DVs.
    Based
Minor correction: Kingler was actually used in the Whirl Cup in Johto. I don’t remember how many times, but I definitely remember it destroying Misty’s Poliwhirl with Crabhammer and then using Vice Grip on Psyduck and getting absolutely wrecked.
    The only bit that I remember from the Orange Island episodes is the Crystal Onix and Misty's Psyduck evolving, so kudos to you for having that kind of memory.
        Fake evolving, but yeah, the moment was so prominent to me because Ash KNOWS that Psyduck is boss when he gets a headache, so what does he do? Uses a claw to squeeze and cause a huge headache, and he was super cocky doing it, too. Just…the worst tactics.
Ash found the one Krabby that came to earth as a baby from Planet Krypton and benches him for 25 years.
You’d think with Ash’s track record of Fire starters with sad backstories that it would’ve evolved and become one of his powerhouses but nope after beating it’s old trainer it just fucked off and that’s despite it training under his own Charizard
    Bianca had Emboar, and they don't usually fully evolve the same starter twice in the same series
        >Paul’s Torterra & Ash’s Torterra

>Kenny’s Empoleon & Barry’s Empoleon

>Ash’s Incineroar & Kukui’s Incineroar

Trust me I don’t think that’s holding them back
Ash also mentioned that its shiny (he didn't use the word shiny) in the diamon and pearl series.
So Noctowl grows but Ash doesn't...
    Reminder that Ash left Alola while Kukui's wife was pregnant and in journeys he cameback and the baby already born.
        Dialga must be drinking on the job or something.
        So at least 9 months have passed in the world...
🤣🤣🤣
        Also there was an episode where Ash is reunited with Lapras and it is also grown taller to the point Ash doesn't recognise it at first...
    My headcanon is that Professor Oak is studying how bonds develop between pokemon and trainers, and Ash and Pikachu are his subjects. Every new league is a new clone of Ash and Pikachu, with the memories of the previous. It explains why Ash never ages and Pikachu seems to fluctuate in strength. Jennys and Joys are clones too, commonly used because they bond well with pokemon suited to law enforcement/healing.
He also used it in the Whirl Islands to battle Misty!
He was our beloved son! HE WILL NOT BE MISSED!!!! *CRIES IN CORNER*
Which is funny because there's only one grass Pokemon that poison is super effective against in Gen 1 and that's Tangela. So really, it wouldn't kick your grass when that song was created
    Technically paras & parasect were as well. Poison was SE against bug in Gen 1, which is why the paras line is the only Pokémon to ever have 3 4x weaknesses
Correct, Dragonite is indeed a big orange dragon.
He is energetic and cute, I would have liked to see how much he could exploit his potential, I feel that Feraligatr, in addition to having a huge butt, is too cute and I still imagine him doing like a duck😩
older fans don't care about new arcs and new fans don't care about old ones, so no one cares about recycling stuff lol
Come to think of it, is squirtle in this picture?
    I think it’s off with the Squritle squad.
> so it could become Venusaur and be a real asset to his team.


Implying it wasn't?!
    For real, in the first several arcs, Bulbasaur is one of Ash's biggest ringers, right up there with Pikachu.

The series is pretty inconsistent in canon with the notion that evolved Pokémon are superior to their precursors.
        Bulbasaur is also the Pokémon which Ash carried with hin for the second most time. Only Pokémon with more episodes is ofc Pikachu.
no, but possibly he met a charizard in charizard village and they had beautiful charmanders
    >charizard village

Is charizard no longer staying at the Charcific Valley?
Kinda hilarious the episodes with guns are banned in the US.

The irony!
    We can't have an adult pointing a gun at Ash's head in a kids show.
        But somehow the squirtle episode with bazooka passed
            Bazookas and lazer weapons are considered over the top and less likely (or impossible) a kid will be able to get their hands on it. Therefore being kid friendly
                Fun fact:  
Batman: The Animated Series fought tooth and nail for the permission to have real guns in their cartoon show. Spider-Man: The Animated Series did not, and only had laser guns (and no punching, too aggressive; only kicks allowed).
                    There was one episode of Spider-Man: The Animated Series that had a real gun. One of the side characters, I forget which one, found his son hiding it and had to chew him out. The showrunner said he felt it was important that it be a recognizable weapon to help get the message across. 

He said he didn't have to fight much for it to be in, that by not constantly fighting the censorship the people in charge were a lot more agreeable when there was something he wanted.
        But the Growlth police academy was allowed
            You could argue that it’s a training prop not a real gun.

But also that’s a stupid argument.
            Can't pass up that sweet copaganda!
    Hard to understand if you weren’t a kid at the time. Media was in a rampage about child gun safety, every news station in the country was running a bimonthly segment where they would gather up local kids and put them in a play room where they had hidden unloaded guns and then air their reactions when they found them. It was kind of wild.
Wait that's why he has so many?

That's fucking hilarious
I have the comic so I remember. It's a shame really,  you get to see dragonair.


Also episode where James has boobs..I was very confused.
And he won that league, that's not  a coincidence!
That's right, it was so long ago I mixed them up
Don't be an ash. Go get your pokemon from the PC every once in a while.
    I used to teach all the pokemon i caught that i knew i wasn't going to use a spare hm and swap them around as needed every so often so i could pretend i was letting them stretch their legs.
There were Aipom in the second movie I think.
    I'm talking about Ash's Aipom
    Not the species as a whole, but the one Aipom that followed Ash.
    Detective pikachu loves aipom
Primeape is still the P1 champion of my heart
    I saw this episode when it aired in 1998. It took me 24 years, but I am just realizing the "P1" is in fact a reference to the NJPW G1 Climax and "Anthony" is a stand-in for Antonio Inoki.
    Considering how much the anime art style has changed I kinda want to see that guy in the modern style
Yes It evolved at the DP Sinnoh league. That was the same generation we got HGSS maybe a coincidence maybe not
    No, likely because using a Cyndaquil in your league battle is inane.
And Butterfree got a Gigantamax form and didn't return either
mine
    That explains why it's not in the picture
**I would like to see Pikachu**
It's not, you folks just hate flowers.
    I love meganiums design, but I do prefer bayleafs by a pretty wide margin. It's why I've always wanted the johot starters to get megas, I feel like with a little bit extra meganiums design could really well blossom
        Bayleef always struck me as just edgy Chikorita, one of those middle evolutions that changes so little I might have forgotten it if not for the anime. Meganium is more cute than ferocious but I definitely like its flower collar better than the seed/joint beads, and the pistil antennas are a clever take.

Though I definitely would have liked a Mega, not only for a fancier look but also because Mega Meganium sounds pretty funny.
            I always thought it was one of the more natural looking middle evolutions. That didn't look to different or edgy.
        Hah, blossom. It has flowers. Puns.
    I think Chikorita and Bayleef's head-leaf-scythe sounds more interesting to see in action, and perhaps the show's writers/animators thought that, too
I know the anime doesn’t follow the same rules as competitive, but my headcalc says Torterra takes 85% and OHKOs with EQ
