What are some unique pokemon name trivia you know or name related questions you want answered?

I have a spreadsheet I'm using to make interesting Regex searches.

Other unique names: Jynx is the only pokemon without a vowel in it's name; Basculegion is the only pokemon with every vowel (excluding form names).

Porygon2 is the only pokemon with a numeral in its name. And in gen 2, if you nickname it you can't change its name back to the species name because numbers aren't allowed in nicknames
    "In Generation V, nicknames the player enters can only contain up to 4 numeric characters. From Generation VI onward, nicknames the player enters can only contain up to 5 numeric characters. However, Pok√©mon transferred from previous generations can violate these limits, and their names will not be changed upon transfer."

Another interesting tidbit about number limitations!
        In generation 5, you couldn‚Äôt trade a cofagrigus online due to profanity in its name.
            Same with Froslass
                Basculin in German is called Barschuft and thus contains the word "Arsch" (ass) hence why it can't be traded either.
                    Barsch is German for bass and Arsch is German for ass. They both went through the same sound change in English (bars -> bass and arse -> ass) but you can see the origin in Barschuft's German name and the reason why the name breaks the filter :P if it were called "Bassculin" in English it would have had the same problem.
                        Bassculin would also have two asses in a row!  

(*cul* being ass in French)
                        As a native German speaker I know this already but thanks for further explaining it for everyone else. :)
                    Just hence

Hence means ‚Äúas a consequence‚Äù or ‚Äúfor this reason‚Äù, so saying hence why is redundant and you can just say ‚Äúhence it can‚Äôt be traded either‚Äù :D
                        But it doesn't really matter, hence why no one else mentioned it
            Or use it in online battles. It would be able to be used in battle or trades if m it was nicknamed.
            can‚Äôt believe cofagrigus is throwing slurs at me every time it speaks üôÑ
    Type:null only one with colon
        Pretty sure most Pokemon shit
            But have you ever seen one of them shit?
                Can‚Äôt wait for Pokemon Shit and Piss version in gen 10
                    Legendaries are Excrementia and Urinia (shiny versions are green and orange respectively)
                Do...they even shit?  I mean Male torchic have visual buttholes and Stunktank shoots flamethrowers anally.
            There's quite a lot of bird Pok√©mon who probably have more of a cloaca than a colon.
        Type: Null is also the only one to not use the English name in Spanish and Italian.
    Flab√©b√© is the only one with diacritical marks (the marks on the √©)

Edit again because i just I was wrong again: Farfetch'd and Mr. Mime were the first with a grammatical symbol in its name until with the apostrophe and full stop respectively. Ho-Oh just has the first hyphenated name

I think Type:Null is the only Pok√©mon with a grammatical symbol in its name that isn't a hyphen
        farfetch'd?
            You're right. Changed it
            Apostrophes are separate characters whereas diacritics are part of the vowel I think
                Person you're replying to was responding to : being the only grammatical symbol in use.
        Flabebe is Moira Rose‚Äôs Pok√©mon. If you know, you know.

I have my wife to thank for this and I can‚Äôt unhear it
            I'm sure she'd have a Murkrow on her team too
            Little b√©b√© crows!
        Now the ruinous quartet is added to that list of Pok√©mon with hyphenated names as well.
    If you change its nickname and just leave it blank, doesnt that revert it back to its species name?
Let‚Äôs give some love to the palindrome name pokemon:

Eevee  
Girafarig  
Ho-oh  
Alomomola  
Farigiraf

Probably some others too I forgot
    You got them all üò∏
        How do you know all this?
            Coding, spreadsheets, regular expressions, and google :)
                What about the letter rank of how many pok√©mon begin with it? (SCMGP etc.)
                    S,134; C,86; M,79; G,65; T,64; P,63; D,60; B,55; A,44; F,40; L,40; R,39; H,33; K,32; W,30; E,26; V,25; N,23; I,17; O,15; Z,14; J,8; Q,7; U,7; Y,6; X,3

My dataset wasn't optimized for this sort of thing (I actually made the spreadsheet using Squirdle Data) so I pulled the data from: 
 https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_name

And then just counted and sorted it in a new spreadsheet
                        S to C is such a big difference
                            Compared to the distribution for dictionaries though they're fairly proportional though, especially compared to vowels and the least frequent letters.
                as far as I remember Regex can't detect palindromes
                    Could you not use TEXTJOIN and MID to reverse the names in a separate columns then run a formula to compare the two?
                        Oh really, I'm not too experienced I just learned abt it passively in a class. My professor told me Regex couldn't detect palindromes cause it couldnt look into the future, but maybe he was just talking in scope of the class or Ruby regex specifically.
                            There are some versions of regexes that do have forward looking characters, the one I use in Google sheets does not have that functionality though.

Palindromes are just well documented and I did some searching recently.

If I was looking for palindromes though I'd just use a spreadsheet function, take the first half of the characters and compare vs the last half.
                    You are correct. It's impossible. Although, it can easily be done through code.
                        Right, you could do it pretty easily with Python string slicing.

edit - quick bodge:

    def palindrome_check(input_string):
        halfway = int(len(input_string)/2)
        return input_string[:halfway] == input_string[-halfway:][::-1]
            Uncle works at Nintendo
        Well there's mew, obviously not a palindrome, but you can rotate it 180¬∞ and it'll be the same.
    If they add Ho-oh in scarlet violet I may do a Palindrome run
        Do it anyways
    Never noticed Girafarig was a palindrome
        But thats its whole gimmick with its two heads
            It's a gimmick that apparently went right over my head, lol.
                And your tail
                    And my axe
                        And that guy's dead wife
                        And your other axe taped handle to handle with the first one
                            Double-bladed axe:  ... *dude* ... I was *right here*
                To add to the gimmick, it's name in Japanese is telekinesis giraffe, which is a palindrome in Japanese kanji
                It was more blatant in the beta design
        Thats like its entire gimmick lol

I wish they had used the beta design where it was double ended, it looked way better than the weird tail head.
        Not only is that its whole gimmick, they even reversed the palindrome with Farigiraf...
        Its name in Japanese translates to Giraffe Telekinesis which is also a palindrome in Japanese. Probably why it was changed from a normal/dark in the beta to a normal/psychic in the final version of Gold and Silver.
        Same here, I think it‚Äôs because I had no clue whatsoever that name is supposed to be pronounced. I just see a big mess of letters and don‚Äôt even try to sound it out. Once I heard it said out loud I was able to notice the palindrome
            I keep pronouncing it giraffe-a-rig in my head.
    I was confused at alomomola until I realized I had just been reading it wrong this entire time. I always pronounced it as alolamola lmao
        Here to paste the same thing. I feel better knowing there are two of us.
    Farigiraf is an amazingly creative name too because its name is a perfect inversion of Girafarig
    Also the region of Alola
    I hated Ho-oh as a kid. I just absolutely hated calling my cover art legendary a hoe. My friends loved it of course.
I don't know if this is really trivia, but in original red and blue, you cannot name your own Jynx. This is because the only way to get one is by trade and can't be renamed.
    Same as Mr. Mime, Lickitung, and Farfetch'd!

You can technically get a nicknamed one by trading with a gen 2 game. The fact that all four are only available via trading in gen 1 but can be caught normally in gen 2 implies that they might be native to other regions or just exceptionally rare.
        If you count Yellow as Gen 1 which it is, then Farfetch‚Äôd is available on routes 12 and 13. I remember because it was in my Pok√©mon Yellow guidebook and I caught my first one there cause I didn‚Äôt care for Dux.
            Damn, missed that when I was looking stuff up, didn't see that this was just for Red and Blue:

https://www.serebii.net/rb/trades.shtml
                Yep! You can also catch Lickitung in Cerulean Cave in Yellow as well! Yellow made a lot of the trade poke‚Äôs available in the wild.
                    I think they swapped the trades with the starters in Yellow, no? You get given Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander fairly early on, and I know one of them is just north of Nugget Bridge.
                        They did swap a few but Jynx and Mr. Mime are still trades in Yellow. And yeah Squirtle is in Vermillion, Charmander across nugget bridge and Bulbasaur in a house in Cerulean. 

I love yellow. Having all the starters is the best.
                            I miss that game so much
                            Just finished a Nuzlocke of Yellow! It was so much fun, I hadn‚Äôt played that game in so long
                    Yellow also let you get a level 5 Machamp via a Cubone for Machoke trade.

Send back a hatched Cubone from GSC and do the trade.
            You can also catch Jynx and Lickitung in Japan's Blue Version. Jynx is in the Seafoam Islands and Lickitung is in the Safari Zone.
                I like Lickitung being in the Safari Zone better than in the Cerulean Cave like it is in Yellow. They should retroactively change that. Haha.
                    Considering it evolves in Sinnoh, it could just be native there instead of Kanto. Obviously it‚Äôs not the only Sinnoh Evo Pokemon to be exclusive to the Safari Zone in RB, so throw in Rhyhorn too
        I remember for a while me and my brother were convinced Ash‚Äôs Pikachu was a girl because I traded him from Yellow which had no gender to Silver which gendered him as female.
            You can trade the yellow pikachu?
                Yep! It's actually just a regular Pikachu as far as the other games are concerned üòÖ
                    Even as far as Yellow is concerned.

The game only has special rules for the first Pikachu you encounter. If you change your starter through glitches, etc., and encounter a Pikachu later, it'll start following you as soon as you catch it.
                It's part of the loophole to evolve your starter Pikachu in Yellow.  
   
Trade it to Red/Blue, evolve it, and trade it back to Yellow.
                If you're a horrible person you can trade the pikachu, evolve to raichu, and then trade back to yellow with your now raichu.
        Good old Dux
    Speaking of Gen 1 oddities...

Without trade backs from Gen 2 you cannot have a Kakuna that knows both Poison Sting and String Shot alongside Harden.

In Red and Blue the same way street for Metapod but with Tackle, but theu fixed it in Yellow, but only for the Caterpie line.

Theu did not update it for Weedle, most likely since you could bot catch Weedle in Yellow.
    I didn't even realize Jynx was gen 1. I assumed it was gen 2. The fact that there was only one may have been the cause.

For a *very* long time, I also assumed Smeargle was gen... I don't even remember. Not gen 2. Apparently it was a rare encounter only in the ruins of alpha grass? Seemed super missable.
        I only ever figured out how to get to the grass inside the Ruins of Alph once and for some reason I could never find my way back there, so I didn‚Äôt even know Natu existed until I saw it in Stadium 2 (and something similar happened with Gligar, nobody I knew had Gold or Crystal, we all had Silver)
    Totally forgot about that. It's been a long time since I've played Gen 1.
    Hypothetically couldn't you trade one to gen 2, breed it, rename the baby, evolve it, and trade the new one to gen 2?
Feraligatr was supposed to be Feraligator but the max was ten characters
    Victreebel is the first victim to the name limit.
        Gyarados was called Skullkraken in the beta, but had to be renamed due to the character limit.
            Ok now I want a regional variant or a paradox form of Gyarados with the name Skullkraken.
                A dark type gyrados with that name would be so cool, mostly black body with a grey face shaped like a skull with horns/spikes.
                    Use this site -> https://aegide.github.io/



And put in Gyarados and Duskull in the two boxes and fuse. Does that match your description?
                        Yes it is somewhat similar to what I was thinking
                That would be called a convergent species, like toedscruel.
                    Or it could be a paradox Pokemon. A past version named Skull Kraken would be fine. Or a regional variant where the regional variant has an extra evolution, as we have already seen before. With a convergent species you'd expect the name to be similar like with other convergent species.
            Thankfully. Gyarados is so much better.
            That's true. I'm going to assume that names that could still make sense when they're shortened (Victreebel instead of bell, Feraligatr instead of Feraligator) when still kept.
                I mean they could have just done Skulkraken.
                    What the heck is a raken and why does it skulk?
                        Same reason a mewt wos.
                            Mewt Wos is a clone of Mewt. If you clone Wewt Wos again, you get Mewt Wosn't.
                    Get outta here with your logic!
        So I guess Vespiquen is not meant to be Vespiqueen? Very interesting
    Honestly it works well without the extra vowel here, makes it seem more wild like it‚Äôs name suggests
        Makes it sound like an early 2000s website √† la Tumblr
            Feraligrindr
                I mean, we've all seen his GSC back sprite, right?
                    Gen 3, GSC cut him off at the arms. 

Also unfortunately it‚Äôs not even cake, dude has a tail, and typically that doesn‚Äôt sit like a foot below the thiccness!
    Never knew about the character limit in regards to the names of certain Pokemon.
    They could have search for other name that fits, but the name was so epic they had to use it, even if it means cutting a letter.
Togedemaru is the longest pokemon name that alternates between vowels and consonants.
    Ah, the true Japanese way!
        Digraphs have entered the chat.
I'm not sure if this was true in other games as well, but in Gen 4 it was impossible to trade a non-nicknamed Weedle on the GTS, due to the profanity filter. I'm not sure if any other pokemon were affected by this.
    gen 5 had a similar thing with cofagrigus.
        Also froslass and nosepass+probopass
            Interesting, I am used to language filters not caring about ass, but I suppose that's because I'm used to them in more human based games. The reason is that it looks dumb as hell when assassin gets censored.
                Lol. "The in is killing everyone! The in is hiding in there!"
            Clbuttic profanity filtering.
        And Conkeldurr
            What is profane in conkeldurr?
                Conk, durr.
        Took me way too long to find the profanity lol
        I'm surprised I never saw "OP is a Cofagrigus," back when that would have been a funny and acceptable joke on Reddit.
            I saw it on a different site I think
    Sounds like Dark Souls censoring Knight as K***ht
    Ah the good old Scunthorpe problem
    Found a similar thread about this: https://pokemondb.net/pokebase/257528/pokemon-traded-wonder-trade-without-giving-censored-nickname

and remembered seeing this about French Gourgeist: https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/4dh7yv/comment/d1rbsim/
    Skuntank had the same issue.
    I believe I've heard the same was true with Probopass and Nosepass, for the same reasons
    Froslass has the same issue for the GTS
    You can't nickname a pokemon "Grape" for this reason too
    I think that was also true for Skuntank
MotHIM
WorMADAM

This is my favorite of all.
    I didn't even notice the Mothim one until now
    NidoQUEEN, NidoKING, GalLADe, and FrosLASS

I was going to say Vespiquen too but it's only a single e
        now im gonna pronounce gallade as galadee, so it sounds like lad
            All Gallade or bow Scottish.
        >NidoQUEEN, NidoKING

Lmao did you really need to point that one out with caps?
        Kinda like GoldEEN and SeaKING right?
            Except they can be either gender. Nidoking is male only, Nidoqueen is female only
        I‚Äôm 99% sure Gallade‚Äôs name has nothing to do with lad. It‚Äôs Gallant Blade.
    I... I never noticed this until now.
    How did I never realize that!?
    Realizing this one helped me with pronunciation too, Wur-mad-um instead of Wur-muh-dam
Until Gen 9 the only pokemon that changed its name in Spanish was Type:Null (C√≥digo Zero), every other mon until paradoxes used the same English names.
    C√≥digo Zero is honestly a dope name. If we ever get another game where we can get a Type:Null I‚Äôll probably use that as its nickname.
        Yeah and Ultra Beasts are better named in Spanish too, ‚ÄúUltraentes‚Äù. Really like that ‚ÄúUltra wormholes‚Äùwere called ‚ÄúUltraumbrales‚Äù and not something like ‚ÄúUltra agujeros de gusano‚Äù

Also the name of the Ultraentes use the japanese name, like Nihilego it‚Äôs UE-01 parasito.
            That's honestly sick af
            Yeah spanish names are better overall, but somehow they still fill dialogue with idioms that nobody ever understands lmao
    I mean it makes sense considering it and the paradox Pok√©mon are the only ones that are just straight up words
        [deleted]
    Mr. Mime is even the same in Spanish. Really disappointing that it‚Äôs not Se√±or Mime.
    I'm not gonna lie, I had no idea Type:Null was an honest-to-god Pokemon! This whole time I thought it was a glitch like Missingno. and not actually a thing.
        It's a fairly common fan theory, actually, that Type:Null is a subtle callback to Missingno.
Noivern's German name is the only one in any language to have more then two capital letters, being UHaFnir
    Why does German capitalize those letters?
        It's meant to be Ultra High Frequency
            Weird Al's greatest work
                WHEEL. OF. FISH!!!!
                    YOU GET: NOTHIIIIING!!! STUUUUUUPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIID!!!!!
                        Turtles are nature's suction cups!
                            CONAN THE LIBRARIAN!
            Ultra High Frequency AND a play on the mythological nordic dragon Fafnir.
        UHF stands for Ultra-High-Frequency.  And it's pre evolution is called eF-eM.
            And if I'm right in thinking, eF-eM is the only one whose name doesn't start with a capital letter in a language
    Wow! That's a really fun pokefact, thanks!
    Noibats name is also the only one to start with a lower case, eF-eM
    Because I can I'm gonna try to name all the english names that have two capital letters without a guide.

Tapu Koko, Lele, Bulu, and Fini (4)

Porygon-Z (5)

Type: Null (6)

All of the paradox Pokemon (22)

Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Chi-Yu (26)

I'm pretty sure I got all of them...?

Edit: Fuck, I forgot Mime Jr., Mr. Mime, and Mr. Rime (29)

Edit 2: and Ho-Oh (30)
        You missed Ho-Oh
            Are both parts of Ho-oh‚Äôs name capitalized? I thought it was just the first part

Edit: yeah after looking it up every official source I could find said it‚Äôs Ho-Oh. Dunno why I thought it was Ho-oh.
                Early TCG prints have the name as Ho-oh (with the lower case second 'o'), so even Pok√©mon couldn't decide early on. Blame them!
        I‚Äôm going to guess they‚Äôre talking about multiple capital letters in the same word. Your examples all include either hyphenations, abbreviations (e.g. Jr.) or two distinct words. German Noivern is literally ‚ÄúUHaFnir‚Äù, no spaces, periods, or hypens. I don‚Äôt know this for sure, but going to guess there aren‚Äôt any examples in English that follow the same rule of multiple capitals within the same unique word.
            Their example was UHaFnir being the only Pok√©mon name in any language with more than 2 capital letters at all, and I just got curious as to how many English names have exactly 2, since every Pok√©mon has at least one.
    I know I saw Noibat and Noiverns German names and I was so confused
        DW, Germans get confused too, just slightly less
        Yeah I pulled a German Noivern V and almost thought it was an error at first. It's a really cool name.
credit to some of my puzzling friends for both of these, but if you anagram and add a letter:

tepig -> togepi -> pidgeot

also, omanyte is tynamo backwards with an added "e" at the start!
    That's the sort of thing that's harder to systematically find but incredibly satisfying to learn about, thanks :)
    "omanyte tynamo" is the only palindrome composed of the names of 2 Pokemon that are not the same Pokemon.
    I figured out how to discover every off-by-one anagram, turns out there is another triplet like the one you mentioned: Golem, Emolga, Glameow.

But when including single letter swaps you can get Goomy, Gloom, Golem as well, making the largest pool size 5.

The pokemon that has the most single character swaps is Nidorina with four: Nidoran‚ôÄ(i>‚ôÄ); Nidoran‚ôÇ(i>‚ôÇ); Nidorino(a>o); Miraidon(n>m)


(note: the data I'm using includes form names, things might change if I use only species names)
S is the most used initial letter in English names for Pokemon with 134 examples. On the other hand, X is the least used initial letter with just 3.
    Xerneas, Xatu, and Xikachu
        Xikachu, the evolution of Pikablu. üòÇ
        Oh Xurkitree? But he's an ultra beast. Not a Pokemon right?
            Ultra Beasts are just alien pokemon. Like if you found a deer on Mars, you would maybe classify it as it's own thing but close enough to an earth Deer that most people won't consider the disctinction
                You wouldn't call it a deer, but you would probably call it an animal.
                    You underestimate humans' ability to give similar names to completely unrelated species.
                        You underestimate humans' ability to be annoyingly pedantic.
            UBs are Pokemon. They can be captured in Pokeballs, used in Pokemon  battles, stored in Pokemon Storage Systems, learn Pokemon moves, have Pokemon typing....
            Tomato tom√†to
            Ultra Beasts are Pokemon from another dimension.
    wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this rings true for regular words in english
    the middle ones are f and h i think
    I remember having one of those old handbooks with all the Pok√©mon and the S section was like 1/6 of the book
Which Pok√©mon has the most amount of different letters in its name, or maybe which Pok√©mon has the longest name where no letters are repeated
    Basculegion is the longest name with no repeated character (Mega Scizor ties if you're including the space, it also has 11).
        Basculegion also has all the main vowels (vowels that are only vowels, not consonants) in its name.
    Excluding form names, the Pokemon with the most unique letters in it's name is also Basculegion. Was trying to think of a good formula when I realized that 12 letter pokemon names could at most tie with it.

Edit: none of the 12 letter names even tie
        woah, you're like a wizard! okay, let me think of one.

are there any pokemon names with 3+ of the same letter?

or if that's a dumb question, what's the reverse of deino (reverse alphabetical order)?
            [deleted]
                OMG
                I‚Äôm guessing also the only Pok√©mon with only two different letters in its name?
                    Ho-Oh
                        Foiled again by these meddling kids‚Ä¶
            Altaria, Serperior, Rhyperior, Electivire, Hoothoot, Kartana, Celesteela, Thundurus, Garganacl too, some others as well but i'm not gonna search for it (those i got from my head ngl)
            [deleted]
                Evolves into *Missouri*
            Raising the stakes a bit to: Pokemon with the most of a single letter in it's name.

Including form names, 5 repetitions: Alolan Rattata (a); Oricorio Pom-Pom Style (o)

Otherwise, 4 repetitions: Alakazam (a); Eevee (e)
                And Steenee, Celesteela
            My Regex had an error, someone caught pokemon I was missing and it's fixed now.

Most repetition with a form name is actually: Galarian Darmanitan Standard Mode (8 a's)

Without forms is still four but includes way more pokemon: 

Alakazam, Eevee, Hoothoot, Sudowoodo, Beheeyem, Steenee, Pyukumuku, Celesteela, Stakataka, Wooloo, Perrserker, Indeedee
Jellicent is the only Pok√©mon with a type that it is not in its name. A water/ghost type with ‚Äúice‚Äù in its name
    Had to double check this :D

Pokemon that do contain their type in their name: Clefairy, Dragonair, Dragonite, Steelix, Mega Steelix, Solrock, Regirock, Regice, Registeel, Darkrai, Scatterbug, Charjabug, Rockruff, Celesteela, Blipbug

Every one of them looks intentional except the ice in Jellicent (which isn't pronounced as ice), probably why!

Curious about other languages now...
        List of English words that contain ‚Äúmeow‚Äù:

Meow

Meows

Meowed

Meowing

Homeowner
            Well, cats DO control the homes the live in.
            Thanks, I will try to pronounce it Ho-Meowner from now on
            always a goodie :)
            Homeowners.
                Homeowning
                    Homeownership
        >Dragonair

Not me being a dumbass saying "wait a min... Air isnt a type and Dragonair doesnt fit here"


Im clearly a dumbass.
        Would Clefairy be intentional if it was named before the Fairy type existed? Like, the name was definitely meant to allude to a "fairy", but I doubt that GameFreak had the Fairy type in mind yet, considering they added two new types in Gen 2 and could have done it then.
    Clefairy in Gen 1 rise up!
In generation 2, only Unown I and V can be shiny due to the way shininess was determined in those games. It was impossible to find a shiny Unown of any other letter until FireRed/LeafGreen.
    What I found interesting about this fact was that this was the case because in Gen 2, shininess was determined by DVs, which were the predecessor to IVs.
        I believe the reliance on DVs also meant that it was impossible to get shiny females when the species' gender ratio was 7:1 in favour of males. 

Also meant that Hidden Power could only ever be Grass for shiny Pok√©mon.
    And even there, unown shiny odds are fucked, since some letters depending on your trainer ID have shiny odds ranging from 1/5.120 to 1/18.432 (base 1/8.192) which is the only way to ‚Äúalter‚Äù the shiny odds.
    The funny thing is that in Gen 2, shinies were determined by the Pok√©mon‚Äôs IVs
        Which were sadly called DVs in Gen2
            That is true, but it was the predecessor
    Also due to the way shinies were determined in Gen2 you can only get shiny male starters
    This fact will always confirm that yes, my first shiny really was an "I" Unown. And that I didn't catch it because I already had that letter.
Some Pok√©mon were banned from the GTS or being traded in Gen 5 because of their name not being nicknamed like Venusaur, Cofagrigus, Weedle and lot of Pok√©mon that have Ass in the their name. 

This was apparently also the case with Go for a while with lot of regular words being banned for the same reason like Muffin.
    Barschuft and Barschwa, the german names contain the word "arsch", which is "ass"
    I get all the others but I‚Äôm racking my brain trying to figure out the problem with Venusaur‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the bad word there?
        Apparently the word ‚Äúsau‚Äù is slang word in german
            I've learned so many bad words in other languages thanks to Pokemon and other games, including several slurs I'd never be aware of if they weren't banned from the game!
            It literally translates to "sow" (as in female pig) It's also a pretty low-intensity and fairly uncommon insult, similar to "you swine"
    This is known as the Scunthorpe problem. 

Used to show up a lot on magic the gathering forums, it used to be very difficult to discuss cards like Royal ******in.
        Never realized that assassin is literally ass ass in lmao
    I thought Marshtomp was banned due to "arsh" but I looked it up and maybe it was due to "sht" lol
Ã∂FÃ∂lÃ∂eÃ∂tÃ∂cÃ∂hÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂dÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂ Ã∂ Crabominable, Squawkabilly, and Brambleghast are the pokemon with the longest names. (12 letters)

From the 1st to the 5th gen, pokemon names couldn't have more than 10 letters.

Mew and Muk have the shortest names with 3 letters
    The character limit best example is Feraligatr
        [deleted]
            Victory bell?
                You know its funny they went with Venusaur for the starter name when Victreebel is closer to a venus flytrap than Venusaur is (I'm aware its actually a pitcher plant and it's a different thing but still).

Additional fun trivia: all three Grass/Poison lines in Gen 1 are three stages and their final stage's name begins with V. Almost had all the first names with B too but Oddish ruined it.
                    üÖ±Ô∏èoddish
                        The more muscular Fighting/Grass cousin.
    Now there are some pokemon with 12 letter names: Crabominable	
Squawkabilly	
Brambleghast

as well as some 12 character names with the new paradox pokemon
    Unfortunately, the 11 letter mons got dethroned for longest name by the 12 letter Crabominable a few years ago.
        Good find, I completely forgot that pokemon haha, I'll edit it!
    I remember playing a ROM hack where they shortened it to 'Fletchindr' lmao
        Just following the precedent Game Freak set with Feraligatr.
        Ive seen "Crabminble" in a romhack lol
            I'd prefer Crabomnabl myself
        Emerald EX has to do that a lot because it still has the character limit. Blacefalon is the most disgusting shortening.
Delibird isn‚Äôt supposed to be pronounced Deli-bird, it‚Äôs actually a pun on delivered.
    Oh. Shit.
It's meant to be delib-erd.
    Signed, sealed, Deliberd
    V in Japanese is substituted with B, since its name is the same in Japanese, its name is literally just Delivered
In gen 4, Fire Fang has the unique ability to hit through Wonder Guard. This affects the Pure Hackmons gen 4 meta.
    I love to think how it went mostly unnoticed in testing because the only Pokemon with Wonder Guard has a Fire weakness anyways.
        Maybe they noticed but didn't care because of that? Idk
    Pok√©mon has been fine spaghetti for it's entire existence üçù
    If you hack the game and bring a Wonder Guard Spiritomb/Sableye to the Battle Tower(?), the AI will actually notice this and start putting you against teams with Fire Fang more often.
        OK that is fascinating
    Only reason for this as well is due to a mixup in the code.

Some moves has that semi-invulnerable state in between turns. Can't remember the exact details, but it was some indexes that got switched around iirc. This also means that you can hit a pokemon in the semi-invulnerable state after using Phantom Force with Fire Fang iirc.
I am also a fan of linguistics so I decided to find out whether there were any Pok√©mon that had the same name as a language. So, I got the list of the 1008 Pok√©mon up to Gen9 (pre-DLC), the list of the 7000+ living and extinct languages listed in the ISO 639-3 standard and wrote a small program to compare the compare the two.

The result was disappointing. I was expecting there to be some little known language out there (maybe in Papua New Guinea or the Amazon) which randomly matched the name of some Pok√©mon but there was only one match and it was a very obvious one: it's Persian.
    Amazing work, always a bit disappointing when it's just one, huh?
    You could also go through the alternative name listings in Glottolog 

Or go through ISO 639-5
    Well since you are talking about languages you are kind of missing an obvious point.. lannguage. What language did you use to determine the names of the Pok√©mon? And the languages? English perhaps has only Persian, but what about others?
        That was for English names.

German and French Pok√©mon names get one unexpected match: Yuyu, the German and French name for the gen 9 legendary Chi-Yu, matches the name of an extinct Aboriginal language from Australia.

Other than those, the English name of Tapu Bulu and Tapu Lele make for some near-matches: there is a Bulu language spoken in Cameroon and three languages named Lele spoken in Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea. The second part fo the German name for Tapu Fini, *Kapu-Fala*, matches the name of the Fala language spoken by a few thousand people in Spain while *Kapu-Toro* (Tapu Bulu) matches the Toro language from Nigeria.
I *think* Starly and Gastly are the closest to being anagrams of each other, with one letter out. Found anything closer?

Edit: to save people pointing it out, there are other obvious ones that are one letter out like Mr. Rime/Mr. Mime, Mime Jr./Mr. Mime, Wiglett/Diglett and Wugtrio/Dugtrio, but I feel like those are kind of boring.
    Things I found:

Pokemon that contain another Pokemon's name:
Parasect and Paras
Porygon2/Porygon-Z and Porygon
Kabutops and Kabuto
Klingklang and Klink/Klang
Pawmot and Pawmo
Kadabra/Crabrawler and Abra
Pyukumuku and Muk
Eternatus and Natu
Azumarill and Marill
Dudunsparce and Dunsparce
Volcarona and Aron
Swoonat and Woobat
Kilowattrel and Wattrel
Pidgeotto and Pidgeot

Pidgeotto is the only pokemon that contains the full name of a Pokemon that comes after it in the Pokedex.

Couldn't come up with a good way of checking anagrams well for everything, but there are some boring ones like Pawmo and Pawmi

Edit: Missed Mewtwo and Mew, somehow? Thanks for catching it in the comments.
        That's interesting, and thanks for your effort. Eternatus/Natu is a super cool one! I had wondered if it might be tricky to do anagrams with Regex, though.

I think the only thing you can really do computationally is sort the characters in the name alphabetically and then sort the list of alphabetised names to try and find matches/near-matches, but that's still not perfect.
        what about mewtwo/mew?
        I know there's letters in between it but Azumarill also has Azurill
        Mewtwo
    I'll look into it and get back to you, cool idea!
    Omanyte and Tynamo are just adding an e
    I figured out how to generate every near-anagram (which I'm defining as adding, subtracting, or substituting one letter) given a list of words.

Their are four pools of five:

Gastly; Ralts; Starly; Staryu; Tauros

Mankey; Mantyke; Omanyte; Ponyta; Tynamo

Emolga; Glameow; Gloom; Golem; Goomy

Miraidon; Nidoran‚ôÄ; Nidoran‚ôÇ; Nidorina; Nidorino


Nidorina is the only Pokemon I found with four anagrams.
Did you know that canonically all Sableyes are either born in the month of May or June?

Because they‚Äôre Gem-in-eyes
    Pokemon dad joke, if only there were dads in Pokemon
        Koga?  Giovanni?  Norman?  Prof.  Birch?  Palmer?  Byron?
            Also Chairman Rose is a daddy
            Mohn in SM/USUM as well.

Which I just learned this week
            Keep your fan OCs to yourself. There are no dads.
                All of those characters are canonically dads in the games. Koga is Janine's Dad, Giovanni is Silvers, Norman is the player character's in Ruby, Birch is the Rival Characters, Palmer is Barry's dad and Byron is Roarks
        Who did I battle in Petalburg, then?
            Joe
                Mama
    Omg lol
    Best Pokemon dad joke ever lol
    Might be different if they use another form of astrology üòã
        [Gen 5 actually did have its own horoscope system, though it seems to correspond with our own real world system](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Horoscope)
    Completely thought they were pronounced sab-le-yees throughout my whole childhood
    /r/angryupvote
    /r/angryupvote
I'm surprised there isn't a pokemon with this as a gimmick. Like Abcdef evolves into Lmnop, then Tuvwxyz, or something like that
    i didn't looked at all the names, but we have the deino line which numbers go 1, 2, and then 3.
        Artic**uno**   
Zap**dos**   
Mol**tres**

Obviously not an evolutionary line, but all clearly tied to each other.
    [deleted]
* The German names of Barschuft(Basculin) and Barschwa(Feebas) needs to get nicknamed first before traded off. it's because the word "arsch"(ass) is in them.
* The German names of Unrat√ºtox(Trubbish), M√§hikel(Skiddo) and B√§hmon(Impidimp) are the only Pok√©mon with an >Umlaut<; aka the letters √§, √∂, and √º.
* The eeveeltion in German all end with the letter >a<, while in English it's >eon<
* A lot of german names were too long (what a surprise /s) and got shortened. Some names were fixed after the limit increased and some stayed the same. For an example Shneppke --> Schneppke (Snorunt), but Frizelbliz (Electrike) stayed. Correctly it should've been Frizelblitz, because >Blitz< is written with a tz.
* After Pok√©mon got officially translated into chinese (before it was fan translated), Pikachu's chinese name got changed 2x. it's because chinese fans got mad how they changed Pikachu's name to something different than "Pikachu"; which was closer in the fan translations. Now it's "P√≠k«éqi≈´" and why 1st gen + legendaries/myths names are rather phonetic than their own creation.
* In nearly all languages, aside from china, Nidoran(m) and Nidoran(f) have their right sex symbol next to their name.
* In nearly all languages, aside from china, Eevee's name starts with "E", from evolution. it's because korea and china follow their phonetic spelling of Eevee's japanese name. Meaning they still pronounce "Eievui", which is the first 2 characters/letters of the word >evolution<.
* Azurmarill is a bit misnamed. Since azure is the color of sky.
* Regice doesn't have a double i, despite the prefix of the golems being made out of "regi". Falsely, it's therefore often pronounced as "Regi-ice".
* The german and japanese name of Whimsicott makes it sound like it's an elf. Since >Elfu(u)n< is made out of  >elf< and >taifun<.
* The german deino line is also numbered. Kap**uno**, **Duo**dino, **Tri**kephalo
* eF-eM is written like that, because if you read out [FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation), it's exactly that.
* The french and korean names are the only versions, that don't seperate the Tapu's names and don't have Uppercase-Uppercase names.
* The german name of Suelord(Clodsire) sounds like a lord going to sue you in english. when in actuality, >**sue**lo< is spanish and means "ground".
* Only in english and french the paradox Pok√©mon names' are seperated.

This was [how I got fas](https://www.pokewiki.de/Pok%C3%A9mon-Liste)t on name information, since the Pikachu fact.
    Additionally, Furnifra√ü (Heatmor) and Rei√ülaus (Wimpod) are the only German pokemon names that contain the letter ·∫û in their names.

Thought this was fitting since you mentioned the √Ñ√ñ√ú ones already.
    Are you sure about the Schneppke thing? You might be thinking of Shnebedeck :)
        I just tried to look up Schnebedeck, but didn't found it. So, yeah. I'm sure about the Schneppke one. But it's also weird, since apparently name changes aren't named in the trivia paragraphs. :-/
Only a handful of Pok√©mon names -most of them from Gen I- that, unaltered, are real words in the English language. These include:

Persian (synonym for Iranian, especially during ancient times)

Mew (onomatopoeic sound from a kitten)

Jynx (curse)

Electrode (those things they put on you to monitor your vitals in a hospital)

Slowpoke (jab at someone who is slow).
    Seel is also a word. Not very commonly used and absolutely nothing to do with seals though.
        Yes. And Gloom is a valid word.
            Mr mime and mime jr as well
    Gloom, Golem, Paras, Oddish, Seel, Alakazam, and Ditto also work. I‚Äôve looked through the national dex and I‚Äôm pretty sure these are the only ones. I guess GF was only putting in real words in as Pok√©mon names in gen 1. Although they did do the same thing later on, with just slightly different spellings, which they also did back then. Even as recently as Flamigo, Tsarenna, Kleavor, Gumshoos, and Falinks.
        >Alakazam

Abra and Kadabra count here too
            Abra and kadabra aren't words, abracadabra is
                I wanna reach out and grab ya
    Jynx is not a word with that definition. Jinx is. However, Jynx is the genus name for a type of woodpecker.
Porygon Z and roserade are the only 3 stage mons you can get at LV 1

Edit: Jesus you guys love this
    Porygon is the only Pok√©mon that can evolve twice without leveling up
    Can you? The trigger for evolution for Budew is still Lvl Up, just *at* a high friendship
        Ya but you can breed a Rosalia without it coming out as a budew
            Or transfer a level 1 budew to PLA and max it's friendship there
            Not anymore
                Such a shame. Now what will we use our Rose Incenses for?

...What do you mean the item has other functions?
                    Are there still Incense items in SV? The only thing I can really see them doing is bypassing the item clause for things like Mystic Water‚Ä¶ why would you use that over Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, Life Orb or like so many other items?
                I guess you could trade a level 1 roselia from a previous gens then evolve it into Roserade and trade it up into the newer games
    Level 1 Meta is wild.

Porygon Z, Roserade, Snorlax...

Lots of strong Pokemon you don't think of.
Abra was so close.
    Other near misses (ruined by the last letter like Abra): Gloom, Muk, Ditto, Deoxys

Ones that got off to the wrong start (ruined by the first letter): Machop, Seel
Mew, Natu, Xatu, Raikou, Taillow, Shinx, Raboot, Rellor
        Deoxyz
            This must be the American spelling instead of the English one
        Damn, you've got some impressive analytical language skills.
            I've spent a while playing with regular expressions in my spreadsheet, that's all üò∏
                Don't sell yourself short. I use regex for work sometimes and looking over your comments even I'm impressed how fast you're answering new questions. Related, could you list the pokemon with one letter that ruins the alphabetical order, regardless of where in the name it appears?
    Zubat is that way in the opposite direction
        Ones like Zubat that are reverse alphabetical except their last letter: Seel, Onix, Mew, Feebas, Spheal, Woobat, Skiddo

Ones that have only the first letter out of order: Muk, Aron, Uxie, Munna
        Didn't know about Zubat, gonna check for more near misses going backwards!
Grafaiai is the only pokemon with four vowels in a row in it's name.

edit: forgot some words
Is y not considered a vowel in english??
    sometimes, but not generally. a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y
        Okay, but obviously in Jynx, it‚Äôs a vowel‚Ä¶
    I was looking for this comment lol the vowel in Jynx is Y yea
    Y is generally taught to be a consonant that can used as a vowel.
    Y and W can be either consonsents or vowels, depending on how they are pronounced. 

Some people are just taught poorly in elementary school.
Koffing and Weezing were named ‚ÄúNy‚Äù and ‚ÄúLa‚Äù respectively in the beta to reference the bad air quality in the cities of New York and Los Angeles.
Every generation introduced a single Pokemon starting with the letter I, except for gen V, which had none, and gens 8 and 9 which have multiple
    Curious about other cases like this, cheers!
        The most similar case is the letter Y, where all 6 Pokemon come from a different generation. Same for X, but that's less interesting since there's only 3 of them. Finally, Q is fun bc of the 7, 3 are from gen 2, 3 are from gen 9, and the last one is from gen 6. A little wonky if you ask me
            Another fact about Q, they're all water and/or starters (excluding H-Qwilfish).
            Thanks for those extra tidbits :D
            Yveltal, yanma, yanmega, yamper, yamask and who's the 6th one?
                Yungoos
    Similarly the 3 Porygons came out in gens 1, 2 and 4, the powers of 2. Considering the thematic link to computer science I was really hoping for a new one in gen 8 but they broke the chain lol
    For now Gen v is also the only gen to not have an I in it‚Äôs Roman numeral. Let‚Äôs see if we get a Pok√©mon starting with I next gen!
Cursola's name only changes a single vowel from Corsola. Arguably, it's the most miniscule change in name out of any Pok√©mon that evolves, as no letters are removed or added.

Edit: Forgot about Pawmi and Pawmo. As an aside, I think Cursola should be appreciated more. Only got like two minutes at most of total screen time in the anime.
    Pawmo and Pawmi are similar there.
        Forgot about those two, crap.
            Well OP is an AI that knows everything of Pok√©mon... ü§£
    Porygon to Porygon2 doesn't add or remove any letters either.
    somewhat related word fact, the "proper" spelling is 'minuscule', but the spelling of 'miniscule' has been accepted as a correct alternative in English due to people mishearing the first 'u' as an 'i'.

edit, from wiktionary: ‚ÄúThe correct spelling is **minuscule** rather than **miniscule**. The latter is a common error, which has arisen by analogy with other words beginning with ‚Äúmini‚Äù, where the meaning is similarly ‚Äòvery small‚Äô.‚Äù (The New Oxford Dictionary of English, Oxford University Press, 1998)
    Mr. Mime and Mr. Rime
Edit:Just saw you said vowels. Whoops lol
Pancham's French name, Pandespi√®gle, is the reason Pok√©mon name characters went from 10 to 12 in the French version of the games since X & Y
How many Pok√©mon have non letters in their name? For example: Porygon2, Farfetch‚Äôd, Sirfetch‚Äôd, etc
    Nidoran‚ôÄ, Nidoran‚ôÇ, Farfetch'd, Mr. Mime, Porygon2, Ho-Oh, Mime Jr., Porygon-Z, Type: Null, Jangmo-o, Hakamo-o, Kommo-o, Sirfetch'd, Mr. Rime, Ting-Lu, Chien-Pao, Wo-Chien, Chi-Yu

As well as all the paradox pokemon with a space in their name.
        The island guardians as well

    Ah yes, Articuno, Moldos and Zaptres.
        A M Z would be the order you catch them. You encounter Articuno first, then Moltres, then you remember the power plant after you beat the game.
        Moldos is what happens when you leave fresh guacamole out for two days
        Those don‚Äôt sound that bad lmao
    Arktos, Zapdos, Lavados. Lol at german localization. Also that they translated Pound to literally Pfund, the british currency. They eventually did an errata im Gen9 and renamed it.
    Another instance of something similar: Deino's evolutionary line references 1,2 and 3 in German: dEINo, ZWEIlous, hyDREIgon.
Flab√©b√© is the first and currently only Pok√©mon that uses an accented letter. 

It's introduction also led to the adding of said accented letter to the UI keyboard, at least in the 3DS era where the keyboards had to be incorporated in the game UI instead of the console itself having an integrated keyboard system like in the Switch.
    Still sad confused due to the fact that no Pok√©mon with an √± were introduced in Paldea.
I think that Spiritomb and Sableye are the only Pok√©mon at one point to not have a type weakness
    Eelektross, if abilities are counted
I love how this is both a useless but interesting fact.
If I'm not mistaken, Flab√©b√© is the only English name with accented letters
The most basic one: ekans and arbok are "snake" and "kobra" spelled in reverse.
    Rellor and Rotom are Roller and Motor backwards, respectively! and Rabsca has the syllables of Scarab in reverse
        Hey! I never clued into that. That's cool.
    Muk is named in the same way too
There's a Zubat hiding in every Electabuzz
The Y in Jynx is serving as a vowell
    Thank Y for your service.
Only 1 number, when spelled out, is in alphabetical order

>!Forty!<
My favorite is the Garganacl line. Nacli > Naclstack > Garganacl the only pokemon that uses the element Al table symbols in the name (I think) intentionally. Na (salt) Cl chlorine NaCl (sodium chloride or salt). And this pokemon is entirely based on salt. Also I love it it makes the first forms name essentially ‚ÄúSalty‚Äù
There are now 8 Pok√©mon with 5 syllables, the most number of syllables:
Feraligatr, Alomomola, Crabominable, Oricorio, Togedemaru, Regielecki, Iron Jugulis, and Fezandipiti. 

(I think this is all of them, I feel like y‚Äôall can let me know if I missed any!)
    Hisuian Zoroark has 7 syllables
        I didn‚Äôt count this because the in-game battle doesn‚Äôt add the Hisuian part, but you are right. Ultra Necrozma technically has 5 as well
    Electivire and Iron Valiant
>Jynx is the only pokemon without a vowel in it‚Äôs name

The y in Jynx is the vowel. Just like in words like my, gym, and syllable.

The grade-school lesson is a, e, i, o, u, *and sometimes y*. (Even though according to Merriam-Webster, y is actually used as a vowel more often than as a consonant).

And along the same vein, Basculegion is the only Pok√©mon with all the letters that are always vowels, but doesn‚Äôt actually have every vowel as it‚Äôs missing y.
    Yup. Y is a consonant when it's at the beginning of a syllable (yes, yuck) and a vowel when it's in the middle or end (myth, shy).
        So the Y in "boy" is a vowel?
Learning so much from this thread, thanks OP for starting the discussion!
Noibat's German name, ef-Em, is the only pokemon name not to start with a capital letter
A female Azurill has a 1 in 3 chance of changing genders when evolving between gens 2-5

Swablu is the only dual type to change both types through evolution

Despite being a pure steel type in generation 3, the only steel type (non hidden power) move mawile learns in gen 3 is iron defence

Bite is the only move to change move category twice, going from physical>special>physical

Ice/psychic and ice/water are the only type combinations that only resist themselves, ghost/dragon is the only type combination to be weak to both of its own types, ghost/normal is the only type combination to only be immune to both of its types and ghost/psychic is only only type combination to have a 4x weakness to one of its own types.
    I thought Swablu only changed one type? From Normal/Flying to Dragon/Flying
Snom is mons backwards which is short for pokemons
    Cute~
    Ah yes Snomekop, the evolved form of Snom.
Just letting you know, the y in Jynx is a vowel. The y in Yanma is a consonant.
The 'y' in Jynx is a vowel. Y and W are sometimes vowels.
    W a vowel?
        'The Welsh language uses ‚Äúw‚Äù as a vowel, and the English language borrows a number of words from Welsh where this is the case: ‚Äúcwm,‚Äù which means ‚Äúvalley‚Äù and pronounced sounds like ‚Äúcoom,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúcrwth,‚Äù which is a stringed instrument and pronounced sounds like ‚Äúcrooth.‚Äù'

https://bookriot.com/is-w-a-vowel/amp/
            Yeah even in Spanish w is pronounced doble u, or double u
            English gets weirder the more I learn
                English is a mutt of a language. It takes and borrows from whatevers useful and sometimes doesn't bother to follow its own rules. But its at least highly adaptable and creative.
                    The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse (indicating prostitute). We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.

James D. Nicoll
        Cwm is a word
        Linguistically, W is kinda weird. It's basically a really fast "oo" sound immediately followed by a different vowel. Ex. "Water" is pronounced like "oo-Ah-ter."
            Yeah, it's pretty much two u's. A double-u, if you will.
            My Grandpa always pronounces it Hoo-ah-ter. Lol.
            And y is the same thing, being an approximant (vowel like sound that is a consonant) that is basically "ee" followed by a vowel. Arguably the native English r sound too, but it's got some real freaky stuff going on that makes it harder to directly compare
        It is a‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúDouble U‚Äù üòè
    A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y and also sometimes W too
    I'll add "R" as an occasional vowel.

Basically vowels aren't letters, but sounds.
Porygon2, Porygon-Z, Flab√©b√©, Type: Null, Mr. Mime, Mime Jr., Mr. Rime, both Nidorans, Farfetch‚Äôd, Sirfetch‚Äôd, Jangmo-o, Hakamo-o, Kommo-o, Ting-Lu, Chien-Pao, Wo-Chien, Chi-yu,and Ho-oh are the only Pok√©mon with a character other than an English letter in their name. If you include spaces then you can add on the paradox mon, and the island guardians
Abra is the only Pok√©mon that shares its name with any country's administrative unit. 

Its namesake place? A mountainous Philippine province in northern Luzon island.
Dhelsmise is the only Pok√©mon that has stab on three different types at once
    Bombirdier has a similar ability
        Bombirdier and Dhelmise are the only two Pok√©mon that have three types with a stab boost
            Any dual typed Pok√©mon terastilizing into a different type:

But as a follow-up, this means Dhelmise and Bombirdier are the only Pok√©mon to have 4 STAB boosts at once.
Golisopod is the only Gol+animal name Pok√©mon that didn‚Äôt release in Gen 1
Basculegion is the longest pokemon name that is also a heterogram(no letter in its name appears more than once)
*EkAnS iS sNaKe BaCkWoRdS.*
    Arbok is kobra backwards
        And muk is‚Ä¶
            Muk is poison lol
Y is [considered a vowel](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/why-y-is-sometimes-a-vowel-usage#:~:text=What%20is%20special%20about%20the,%2C%20deny%2C%20bicycle%2C%20acrylic.) if the word has no other vowels.


Where I'm from Y is just a vowel full stop.
Type: Null is typically called "Silvally" in some non-videogame mediums.
Cant name your mon Cofagrigus because of censoring
Unova is the only region thus far to not only have its name changed in English (Isshu is its Japanese name), but have its name changed across multiple languages.
    I wonder what the isshu was with them translating it separately?
Porygon-Z's Japanese name is the only one with a foreign letter in it  „Éù„É™„Ç¥„É≥Z
Saying Jynx has no vowels isn't quite accurate. In English, Y is a weird sometimes vowel. It's not usually a vowel (like in the word "Yesterday") but it can be (Like in the word "Glyph.") The vowel in Jynx is the Y.
Are there any cases of strings of Pok√©mon whose names go in alphabetical order in the Pok√©dex? Or maybe Pok√©mon whose names are in reverse alphabetical order?
    in ascending order the longest string is 6 - avalugg, noibat, noivern, xerneas, yveltal, zygarde

in descending order there are several 5s -

starly, staravia, staraptor, bidoof, bibarel

stunky, skuntank, bronzor, bronzong, bonsly

vullaby, mandibuzz, heatmor, durant, deino

trenevant, pumpkaboo, gourgeist, bergmite, avalugg

scovillain, rellor, rabsca, flittle, espathra
        Amazing, thanks for compiling!

Looks like there is a very boring one now due to all the "Iron" paradox pokemon in a row though...

Edit: nevermind, I misread, it's not just the first letter of the names but the names themselves
the y in english can be considered a vowel iirc in some cases?
Girafarig and its evolution are palindromes.
There are some pokemon whose name spelled backwards are real life animals or objects:

Ekans = Snake
Arbok = Kobra (Cobra)
Rotom = Motor
I looked at the title, scanned thru the Dex thinking, "It should be 5 letters or less," and found out it was Deino. Pretty cool.
Some pokemon names are just words

Golem

Electrode

Persian

Lanturn

Mew


Also Araquanid, Coalassal, Bombirdier, Orthworm and Sandaconda are the greatest pun names don't @ me
I always find it fascinating how because gender hadn‚Äôt been introduced till gen 2, both Nidorans are the only Pok√©mon to have symbols in their names.
Joltik has a higher hp stat than Onix
Nacli and it‚Äôs family all contain the chemical formula for salt in their names. I think it‚Äôs rather clever, especially Nacli who‚Äôs name translates into salty
Here‚Äôs some unique trivia: Parasect and Paras are the only Pokemon to ever have 3 4X weaknesses
The German name of Fennekin is "Fynx". This name doesn't use any vowel
    What is Jynx called in German?
        Jennekin
        Rossana!
According to the German Pok√©mon Wiki it's a combo between "Rosso" (apparently Italian for red) and the name "Roxana".
    Is Y never a vowel in German? That's interesting they'd do that then.
Was Mime Jr. the first pokemon with a space in its name?
    Mr. Mime ;)
Unknown
    Because of that Pokemon I get mixed up when writing the actual word...
Hey, "sometimes y," man.
The first time you could catch a wild Eevee is in Black & White 2. That's five full generations as a purely in-game gift.
    You could catch it in Platinum in the trophy garden.
But Y is a vowel‚Ä¶.
Y counts as a vovel in french, but the pokemons name was even more racist than its appearance itself in gen 1
Technically y is considered to be a vowel so the fact about Jynx wouldn‚Äôt count.
Flab√©b√© is the only English Pok√©mon name containing diacritics
Some Pok√©mon like Arbok and Muk are named after what they are but backwards
    Same with Rellor and Amgil
can't wait for all the smogon scavengers to arrive.
In Jynx‚Äôs case, Y is a vowel. There is no other vowel present in its name so Y is changed to a vowel
in gen 5, conkelldur can't be nicknamed conkelldur because conk is French for Fuck
I was just thinking about Jynx‚Ä¶ when I learned the alphabet, I learned that Y is sometimes a vowel and sometimes not. 

Being the middle component of the single syllable, between two vowel sounds, Y is actually a vowel here. It pretty much is just the short i vowel, just written with a Y for perhaps arbitrary reasons.
Crabominable has the longest name of any Pok√©mon.
Y is a vowel.

Especially [d í…™≈ãks]
ekans and arbok are snake names spelled backwards
Y is a vowel depending on the situation though. It's the case for Jynx.
Ekans is snake backwards lol
I think everyone knows this but Feraligatr‚Äôs name is shortened like that only because it would‚Äôve passed the character limit in gen 2, then they didn‚Äôt change it because they knew people would get mad about them changing it.
Here's a buried tidbit:

I only added the "Other unique names" part because the post was originally to on short for the automoderator üòÖ
Afaik I think it's Vulpix that has HP50 printed on the card instead of the normal #HP that all other cards have
Well, in Jynx "Y" would count as a vowel. "Y" only counts as a vowel if there are no other vowels in the word.
The Pokemon with the least amount of letters in its name is a tie between Muk and Mew.
Marill and Azumarill (and later Azurill) are the only ‚ÄúPikaclones‚Äù that aren‚Äôt Electric-type, unless one counts Mimikyu.
Dawn is the very first main character to catch an electric-type Pok√©mon (Pachirisu) in series after Ash and Pikachu.
Idk off the top of my head if it has since changed, but I think I remember flabebe being the only Pok√©mon whose name in English used diacritics
Misty‚Äôs name is a punny transliteration of her Japanese name, Kasumi (meaning ‚ÄúFog‚Äù or ‚ÄúFoggy‚Äù), and Iris is the first main character not to have her name changed in English.
As of Scarlet & Violet, Slow Start is no longer Regigigas‚Äôs signature ability, as Revavroom can also have that ability now.
Meowth is the only Pok√©mon with a regional variant from two other regions, while Tauros is the only Pok√©mon with multiple regional variants in one region.
The longest named pokemon is Fletchinder
Basculegion is the only pokemon to have every vowel in its name (no, Y does not count because it‚Äôs a situational vowel)
In red and blue, only two (non mew) pokemon could learn all 4 of the TMs blizzard, thunder, earthquake, and fire blast.... Taurus and Nidoking.
Deino, Zweilous and Hydreigon have the German mumbers for 1, 2 and 3 in them: eins, zwei and drei.
Lucario is the only Pokemon where if you say its spelling backwards you spell its pre-evolution. (lucaRIOLUcario)

Abra - Kadabra sounds like a magic spell, and Kadabra also has the name of it spre-evolution in its name. (kadABRA)
Some foreign-language name facts! \~

\-Gourgeist's French name is Banshitrouye, which contains every vowel including Y (which is always a vowel in French!)

\-Clodsire's Japanese name is„Éâ„Ç™„Éº / Do≈ç, making them the newest member of the Triple-Vowel Club‚Ñ¢Ô∏è alongside Abomasnow („É¶„Ç≠„Éé„Ç™„Éº / Yukin**o≈ç**), Skiddo („É°„Çß„Éº„ÇØ„É´ / M**eƒì**kuru), and Lunala („É´„Éä„Ç¢„Éº„É© / Run**aƒÅ**ra).

\-Revavroom and Klinklang are the only Pok√©mon whose names contain 3 of the same kana in a row. Their respective Japanese names are „Éñ„É≠„É≠„É≠„Éº„É† (Buroror≈çmu) and „ÇÆ„ÇÆ„ÇÆ„Ç¢„É´ (Gigigiaru), which are really fun to say.

\-Frigibax's Japanese name is „Çª„Éì„Ç® (Sebie) which is the only one so far that ends in full-size „Ç® (Pheromosa's Japanese name ends in a small one: it's „Éï„Çß„É≠„Éº„ÉÅ„Çß / Fer≈çche).

\-The Japanese names of Pawmo („Éë„É¢„ÉÉ„Éà / Pamotto) and Pawmot („Éë„Éº„É¢„ÉÉ„Éà / PƒÅmotto) differ only by a long vowel, a trait also shared by Sentret and Furret.

\-Pawmi, Greavard, and Cleffa are tied for the shortest Japanese name of all Pok√©mon: their respective names in Japanese are „Éë„É¢ (Pamo), „Éú„ÉÅ (Bochi), and „Éî„Ç£(Pƒ´).

\-As of Gen 8 (don't know if this still holds in Gen 9), the most common ending kana for Japanese Pok√©mon names is „É≥ (n), so the Pok√©dex is basically a minefield for [shiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiritori)[tori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgRfBigHj9c).

\-Naclstack's Japanese name is „Ç∏„Ç™„ÉÖ„É† (Jiodzumu), which is the first and currently only Pok√©mon name to contain the character „ÉÖ (dzu).

\-Iron Bundle has the longest *romanized* Japanese name: Tetsunotsutsumi (written in kana as 	„ÉÜ„ÉÑ„Éé„ÉÑ„ÉÑ„Éü).

\-[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgRfBigHj9c) misspells Corviknight's Japanese name („Ç¢„Éº„Éû„Éº„Ç¨„Ç¢ / ƒÄmƒÅgƒÅ) with a small „Ç¢ at the end, but it actually ends in a full-sized „Ç¢.
"In Generation V, nicknames the player enters can only contain up to 4 numeric characters. From Generation VI onward, nicknames the player enters can only contain up to 5 numeric characters. However, Pok√©mon transferred from previous generations can violate these limits, and their names will not be changed upon transfer."

https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nickname

Another interesting tidbit about number limitations!
    In generation 5, you couldn‚Äôt trade a cofagrigus online due to profanity in its name.
        Same with Froslass
            Basculin in German is called Barschuft and thus contains the word "Arsch" (ass) hence why it can't be traded either.
                Barsch is German for bass and Arsch is German for ass. They both went through the same sound change in English (bars -> bass and arse -> ass) but you can see the origin in Barschuft's German name and the reason why the name breaks the filter :P if it were called "Bassculin" in English it would have had the same problem.
                    Bassculin would also have two asses in a row!  

(*cul* being ass in French)
                    As a native German speaker I know this already but thanks for further explaining it for everyone else. :)
                Just hence

Hence means ‚Äúas a consequence‚Äù or ‚Äúfor this reason‚Äù, so saying hence why is redundant and you can just say ‚Äúhence it can‚Äôt be traded either‚Äù :D
                    But it doesn't really matter, hence why no one else mentioned it
        Or use it in online battles. It would be able to be used in battle or trades if m it was nicknamed.
        can‚Äôt believe cofagrigus is throwing slurs at me every time it speaks üôÑ
Type:null only one with colon
    Pretty sure most Pokemon shit
        But have you ever seen one of them shit?
            Can‚Äôt wait for Pokemon Shit and Piss version in gen 10
                Legendaries are Excrementia and Urinia (shiny versions are green and orange respectively)
            Do...they even shit?  I mean Male torchic have visual buttholes and Stunktank shoots flamethrowers anally.
        There's quite a lot of bird Pok√©mon who probably have more of a cloaca than a colon.
    Type: Null is also the only one to not use the English name in Spanish and Italian.
Flab√©b√© is the only one with diacritical marks (the marks on the √©)

Edit again because i just I was wrong again: Farfetch'd and Mr. Mime were the first with a grammatical symbol in its name until with the apostrophe and full stop respectively. Ho-Oh just has the first hyphenated name

I think Type:Null is the only Pok√©mon with a grammatical symbol in its name that isn't a hyphen
    farfetch'd?
        You're right. Changed it
        Apostrophes are separate characters whereas diacritics are part of the vowel I think
            Person you're replying to was responding to : being the only grammatical symbol in use.
    Flabebe is Moira Rose‚Äôs Pok√©mon. If you know, you know.

I have my wife to thank for this and I can‚Äôt unhear it
        I'm sure she'd have a Murkrow on her team too
        Little b√©b√© crows!
    Now the ruinous quartet is added to that list of Pok√©mon with hyphenated names as well.
If you change its nickname and just leave it blank, doesnt that revert it back to its species name?
You got them all üò∏
    How do you know all this?
        Coding, spreadsheets, regular expressions, and google :)
            What about the letter rank of how many pok√©mon begin with it? (SCMGP etc.)
                S,134; C,86; M,79; G,65; T,64; P,63; D,60; B,55; A,44; F,40; L,40; R,39; H,33; K,32; W,30; E,26; V,25; N,23; I,17; O,15; Z,14; J,8; Q,7; U,7; Y,6; X,3

My dataset wasn't optimized for this sort of thing (I actually made the spreadsheet using Squirdle Data) so I pulled the data from: 
 https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_name

And then just counted and sorted it in a new spreadsheet
                    S to C is such a big difference
                        Compared to the distribution for dictionaries though they're fairly proportional though, especially compared to vowels and the least frequent letters.
            as far as I remember Regex can't detect palindromes
                Could you not use TEXTJOIN and MID to reverse the names in a separate columns then run a formula to compare the two?
                    Oh really, I'm not too experienced I just learned abt it passively in a class. My professor told me Regex couldn't detect palindromes cause it couldnt look into the future, but maybe he was just talking in scope of the class or Ruby regex specifically.
                        There are some versions of regexes that do have forward looking characters, the one I use in Google sheets does not have that functionality though.

Palindromes are just well documented and I did some searching recently.

If I was looking for palindromes though I'd just use a spreadsheet function, take the first half of the characters and compare vs the last half.
                You are correct. It's impossible. Although, it can easily be done through code.
                    Right, you could do it pretty easily with Python string slicing.

edit - quick bodge:

    def palindrome_check(input_string):
        halfway = int(len(input_string)/2)
        return input_string[:halfway] == input_string[-halfway:][::-1]
        Uncle works at Nintendo
    Well there's mew, obviously not a palindrome, but you can rotate it 180¬∞ and it'll be the same.
If they add Ho-oh in scarlet violet I may do a Palindrome run
    Do it anyways
Never noticed Girafarig was a palindrome
    But thats its whole gimmick with its two heads
        It's a gimmick that apparently went right over my head, lol.
            And your tail
                And my axe
                    And that guy's dead wife
                    And your other axe taped handle to handle with the first one
                        Double-bladed axe:  ... *dude* ... I was *right here*
            To add to the gimmick, it's name in Japanese is telekinesis giraffe, which is a palindrome in Japanese kanji
            It was more blatant in the beta design
    Thats like its entire gimmick lol

I wish they had used the beta design where it was double ended, it looked way better than the weird tail head.
    Not only is that its whole gimmick, they even reversed the palindrome with Farigiraf...
    Its name in Japanese translates to Giraffe Telekinesis which is also a palindrome in Japanese. Probably why it was changed from a normal/dark in the beta to a normal/psychic in the final version of Gold and Silver.
    Same here, I think it‚Äôs because I had no clue whatsoever that name is supposed to be pronounced. I just see a big mess of letters and don‚Äôt even try to sound it out. Once I heard it said out loud I was able to notice the palindrome
        I keep pronouncing it giraffe-a-rig in my head.
I was confused at alomomola until I realized I had just been reading it wrong this entire time. I always pronounced it as alolamola lmao
    Here to paste the same thing. I feel better knowing there are two of us.
Farigiraf is an amazingly creative name too because its name is a perfect inversion of Girafarig
Also the region of Alola
I hated Ho-oh as a kid. I just absolutely hated calling my cover art legendary a hoe. My friends loved it of course.
Same as Mr. Mime, Lickitung, and Farfetch'd!

You can technically get a nicknamed one by trading with a gen 2 game. The fact that all four are only available via trading in gen 1 but can be caught normally in gen 2 implies that they might be native to other regions or just exceptionally rare.
    If you count Yellow as Gen 1 which it is, then Farfetch‚Äôd is available on routes 12 and 13. I remember because it was in my Pok√©mon Yellow guidebook and I caught my first one there cause I didn‚Äôt care for Dux.
        Damn, missed that when I was looking stuff up, didn't see that this was just for Red and Blue:

https://www.serebii.net/rb/trades.shtml
            Yep! You can also catch Lickitung in Cerulean Cave in Yellow as well! Yellow made a lot of the trade poke‚Äôs available in the wild.
                I think they swapped the trades with the starters in Yellow, no? You get given Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander fairly early on, and I know one of them is just north of Nugget Bridge.
                    They did swap a few but Jynx and Mr. Mime are still trades in Yellow. And yeah Squirtle is in Vermillion, Charmander across nugget bridge and Bulbasaur in a house in Cerulean. 

I love yellow. Having all the starters is the best.
                        I miss that game so much
                        Just finished a Nuzlocke of Yellow! It was so much fun, I hadn‚Äôt played that game in so long
                Yellow also let you get a level 5 Machamp via a Cubone for Machoke trade.

Send back a hatched Cubone from GSC and do the trade.
        You can also catch Jynx and Lickitung in Japan's Blue Version. Jynx is in the Seafoam Islands and Lickitung is in the Safari Zone.
            I like Lickitung being in the Safari Zone better than in the Cerulean Cave like it is in Yellow. They should retroactively change that. Haha.
                Considering it evolves in Sinnoh, it could just be native there instead of Kanto. Obviously it‚Äôs not the only Sinnoh Evo Pokemon to be exclusive to the Safari Zone in RB, so throw in Rhyhorn too
    I remember for a while me and my brother were convinced Ash‚Äôs Pikachu was a girl because I traded him from Yellow which had no gender to Silver which gendered him as female.
        You can trade the yellow pikachu?
            Yep! It's actually just a regular Pikachu as far as the other games are concerned üòÖ
                Even as far as Yellow is concerned.

The game only has special rules for the first Pikachu you encounter. If you change your starter through glitches, etc., and encounter a Pikachu later, it'll start following you as soon as you catch it.
            It's part of the loophole to evolve your starter Pikachu in Yellow.  
   
Trade it to Red/Blue, evolve it, and trade it back to Yellow.
            If you're a horrible person you can trade the pikachu, evolve to raichu, and then trade back to yellow with your now raichu.
    Good old Dux
Speaking of Gen 1 oddities...

Without trade backs from Gen 2 you cannot have a Kakuna that knows both Poison Sting and String Shot alongside Harden.

In Red and Blue the same way street for Metapod but with Tackle, but theu fixed it in Yellow, but only for the Caterpie line.

Theu did not update it for Weedle, most likely since you could bot catch Weedle in Yellow.
I didn't even realize Jynx was gen 1. I assumed it was gen 2. The fact that there was only one may have been the cause.

For a *very* long time, I also assumed Smeargle was gen... I don't even remember. Not gen 2. Apparently it was a rare encounter only in the ruins of alpha grass? Seemed super missable.
    I only ever figured out how to get to the grass inside the Ruins of Alph once and for some reason I could never find my way back there, so I didn‚Äôt even know Natu existed until I saw it in Stadium 2 (and something similar happened with Gligar, nobody I knew had Gold or Crystal, we all had Silver)
Totally forgot about that. It's been a long time since I've played Gen 1.
Hypothetically couldn't you trade one to gen 2, breed it, rename the baby, evolve it, and trade the new one to gen 2?
Victreebel is the first victim to the name limit.
    Gyarados was called Skullkraken in the beta, but had to be renamed due to the character limit.
        Ok now I want a regional variant or a paradox form of Gyarados with the name Skullkraken.
            A dark type gyrados with that name would be so cool, mostly black body with a grey face shaped like a skull with horns/spikes.
                Use this site -> https://aegide.github.io/



And put in Gyarados and Duskull in the two boxes and fuse. Does that match your description?
                    Yes it is somewhat similar to what I was thinking
            That would be called a convergent species, like toedscruel.
                Or it could be a paradox Pokemon. A past version named Skull Kraken would be fine. Or a regional variant where the regional variant has an extra evolution, as we have already seen before. With a convergent species you'd expect the name to be similar like with other convergent species.
        Thankfully. Gyarados is so much better.
        That's true. I'm going to assume that names that could still make sense when they're shortened (Victreebel instead of bell, Feraligatr instead of Feraligator) when still kept.
            I mean they could have just done Skulkraken.
                What the heck is a raken and why does it skulk?
                    Same reason a mewt wos.
                        Mewt Wos is a clone of Mewt. If you clone Wewt Wos again, you get Mewt Wosn't.
                Get outta here with your logic!
    So I guess Vespiquen is not meant to be Vespiqueen? Very interesting
Honestly it works well without the extra vowel here, makes it seem more wild like it‚Äôs name suggests
    Makes it sound like an early 2000s website √† la Tumblr
        Feraligrindr
            I mean, we've all seen his GSC back sprite, right?
                Gen 3, GSC cut him off at the arms. 

Also unfortunately it‚Äôs not even cake, dude has a tail, and typically that doesn‚Äôt sit like a foot below the thiccness!
Never knew about the character limit in regards to the names of certain Pokemon.
They could have search for other name that fits, but the name was so epic they had to use it, even if it means cutting a letter.
Ah, the true Japanese way!
    Digraphs have entered the chat.
gen 5 had a similar thing with cofagrigus.
    Also froslass and nosepass+probopass
        Interesting, I am used to language filters not caring about ass, but I suppose that's because I'm used to them in more human based games. The reason is that it looks dumb as hell when assassin gets censored.
            Lol. "The in is killing everyone! The in is hiding in there!"
        Clbuttic profanity filtering.
    And Conkeldurr
        What is profane in conkeldurr?
            Conk, durr.
    Took me way too long to find the profanity lol
    I'm surprised I never saw "OP is a Cofagrigus," back when that would have been a funny and acceptable joke on Reddit.
        I saw it on a different site I think
Sounds like Dark Souls censoring Knight as K***ht
Ah the good old Scunthorpe problem
Found a similar thread about this: https://pokemondb.net/pokebase/257528/pokemon-traded-wonder-trade-without-giving-censored-nickname

and remembered seeing this about French Gourgeist: https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/4dh7yv/comment/d1rbsim/
Skuntank had the same issue.
I believe I've heard the same was true with Probopass and Nosepass, for the same reasons
Froslass has the same issue for the GTS
You can't nickname a pokemon "Grape" for this reason too
I think that was also true for Skuntank
I didn't even notice the Mothim one until now
NidoQUEEN, NidoKING, GalLADe, and FrosLASS

I was going to say Vespiquen too but it's only a single e
    now im gonna pronounce gallade as galadee, so it sounds like lad
        All Gallade or bow Scottish.
    >NidoQUEEN, NidoKING

Lmao did you really need to point that one out with caps?
    Kinda like GoldEEN and SeaKING right?
        Except they can be either gender. Nidoking is male only, Nidoqueen is female only
    I‚Äôm 99% sure Gallade‚Äôs name has nothing to do with lad. It‚Äôs Gallant Blade.
I... I never noticed this until now.
How did I never realize that!?
Realizing this one helped me with pronunciation too, Wur-mad-um instead of Wur-muh-dam
C√≥digo Zero is honestly a dope name. If we ever get another game where we can get a Type:Null I‚Äôll probably use that as its nickname.
    Yeah and Ultra Beasts are better named in Spanish too, ‚ÄúUltraentes‚Äù. Really like that ‚ÄúUltra wormholes‚Äùwere called ‚ÄúUltraumbrales‚Äù and not something like ‚ÄúUltra agujeros de gusano‚Äù

Also the name of the Ultraentes use the japanese name, like Nihilego it‚Äôs UE-01 parasito.
        That's honestly sick af
        Yeah spanish names are better overall, but somehow they still fill dialogue with idioms that nobody ever understands lmao
I mean it makes sense considering it and the paradox Pok√©mon are the only ones that are just straight up words
    [deleted]
Mr. Mime is even the same in Spanish. Really disappointing that it‚Äôs not Se√±or Mime.
I'm not gonna lie, I had no idea Type:Null was an honest-to-god Pokemon! This whole time I thought it was a glitch like Missingno. and not actually a thing.
    It's a fairly common fan theory, actually, that Type:Null is a subtle callback to Missingno.
Why does German capitalize those letters?
    It's meant to be Ultra High Frequency
        Weird Al's greatest work
            WHEEL. OF. FISH!!!!
                YOU GET: NOTHIIIIING!!! STUUUUUUPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIID!!!!!
                    Turtles are nature's suction cups!
                        CONAN THE LIBRARIAN!
        Ultra High Frequency AND a play on the mythological nordic dragon Fafnir.
    UHF stands for Ultra-High-Frequency.  And it's pre evolution is called eF-eM.
        And if I'm right in thinking, eF-eM is the only one whose name doesn't start with a capital letter in a language
Wow! That's a really fun pokefact, thanks!
Noibats name is also the only one to start with a lower case, eF-eM
Because I can I'm gonna try to name all the english names that have two capital letters without a guide.

Tapu Koko, Lele, Bulu, and Fini (4)

Porygon-Z (5)

Type: Null (6)

All of the paradox Pokemon (22)

Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Chi-Yu (26)

I'm pretty sure I got all of them...?

Edit: Fuck, I forgot Mime Jr., Mr. Mime, and Mr. Rime (29)

Edit 2: and Ho-Oh (30)
    You missed Ho-Oh
        Are both parts of Ho-oh‚Äôs name capitalized? I thought it was just the first part

Edit: yeah after looking it up every official source I could find said it‚Äôs Ho-Oh. Dunno why I thought it was Ho-oh.
            Early TCG prints have the name as Ho-oh (with the lower case second 'o'), so even Pok√©mon couldn't decide early on. Blame them!
    I‚Äôm going to guess they‚Äôre talking about multiple capital letters in the same word. Your examples all include either hyphenations, abbreviations (e.g. Jr.) or two distinct words. German Noivern is literally ‚ÄúUHaFnir‚Äù, no spaces, periods, or hypens. I don‚Äôt know this for sure, but going to guess there aren‚Äôt any examples in English that follow the same rule of multiple capitals within the same unique word.
        Their example was UHaFnir being the only Pok√©mon name in any language with more than 2 capital letters at all, and I just got curious as to how many English names have exactly 2, since every Pok√©mon has at least one.
I know I saw Noibat and Noiverns German names and I was so confused
    DW, Germans get confused too, just slightly less
    Yeah I pulled a German Noivern V and almost thought it was an error at first. It's a really cool name.
That's the sort of thing that's harder to systematically find but incredibly satisfying to learn about, thanks :)
"omanyte tynamo" is the only palindrome composed of the names of 2 Pokemon that are not the same Pokemon.
I figured out how to discover every off-by-one anagram, turns out there is another triplet like the one you mentioned: Golem, Emolga, Glameow.

But when including single letter swaps you can get Goomy, Gloom, Golem as well, making the largest pool size 5.

The pokemon that has the most single character swaps is Nidorina with four: Nidoran‚ôÄ(i>‚ôÄ); Nidoran‚ôÇ(i>‚ôÇ); Nidorino(a>o); Miraidon(n>m)


(note: the data I'm using includes form names, things might change if I use only species names)
Xerneas, Xatu, and Xikachu
    Xikachu, the evolution of Pikablu. üòÇ
    Oh Xurkitree? But he's an ultra beast. Not a Pokemon right?
        Ultra Beasts are just alien pokemon. Like if you found a deer on Mars, you would maybe classify it as it's own thing but close enough to an earth Deer that most people won't consider the disctinction
            You wouldn't call it a deer, but you would probably call it an animal.
                You underestimate humans' ability to give similar names to completely unrelated species.
                    You underestimate humans' ability to be annoyingly pedantic.
        UBs are Pokemon. They can be captured in Pokeballs, used in Pokemon  battles, stored in Pokemon Storage Systems, learn Pokemon moves, have Pokemon typing....
        Tomato tom√†to
        Ultra Beasts are Pokemon from another dimension.
wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this rings true for regular words in english
the middle ones are f and h i think
I remember having one of those old handbooks with all the Pok√©mon and the S section was like 1/6 of the book
Basculegion is the longest name with no repeated character (Mega Scizor ties if you're including the space, it also has 11).
    Basculegion also has all the main vowels (vowels that are only vowels, not consonants) in its name.
Excluding form names, the Pokemon with the most unique letters in it's name is also Basculegion. Was trying to think of a good formula when I realized that 12 letter pokemon names could at most tie with it.

Edit: none of the 12 letter names even tie
    woah, you're like a wizard! okay, let me think of one.

are there any pokemon names with 3+ of the same letter?

or if that's a dumb question, what's the reverse of deino (reverse alphabetical order)?
        [deleted]
            OMG
            I‚Äôm guessing also the only Pok√©mon with only two different letters in its name?
                Ho-Oh
                    Foiled again by these meddling kids‚Ä¶
        Altaria, Serperior, Rhyperior, Electivire, Hoothoot, Kartana, Celesteela, Thundurus, Garganacl too, some others as well but i'm not gonna search for it (those i got from my head ngl)
        [deleted]
            Evolves into *Missouri*
        Raising the stakes a bit to: Pokemon with the most of a single letter in it's name.

Including form names, 5 repetitions: Alolan Rattata (a); Oricorio Pom-Pom Style (o)

Otherwise, 4 repetitions: Alakazam (a); Eevee (e)
            And Steenee, Celesteela
        My Regex had an error, someone caught pokemon I was missing and it's fixed now.

Most repetition with a form name is actually: Galarian Darmanitan Standard Mode (8 a's)

Without forms is still four but includes way more pokemon: 

Alakazam, Eevee, Hoothoot, Sudowoodo, Beheeyem, Steenee, Pyukumuku, Celesteela, Stakataka, Wooloo, Perrserker, Indeedee
Had to double check this :D

Pokemon that do contain their type in their name: Clefairy, Dragonair, Dragonite, Steelix, Mega Steelix, Solrock, Regirock, Regice, Registeel, Darkrai, Scatterbug, Charjabug, Rockruff, Celesteela, Blipbug

Every one of them looks intentional except the ice in Jellicent (which isn't pronounced as ice), probably why!

Curious about other languages now...
    List of English words that contain ‚Äúmeow‚Äù:

Meow

Meows

Meowed

Meowing

Homeowner
        Well, cats DO control the homes the live in.
        Thanks, I will try to pronounce it Ho-Meowner from now on
        always a goodie :)
        Homeowners.
            Homeowning
                Homeownership
    >Dragonair

Not me being a dumbass saying "wait a min... Air isnt a type and Dragonair doesnt fit here"


Im clearly a dumbass.
    Would Clefairy be intentional if it was named before the Fairy type existed? Like, the name was definitely meant to allude to a "fairy", but I doubt that GameFreak had the Fairy type in mind yet, considering they added two new types in Gen 2 and could have done it then.
Clefairy in Gen 1 rise up!
What I found interesting about this fact was that this was the case because in Gen 2, shininess was determined by DVs, which were the predecessor to IVs.
    I believe the reliance on DVs also meant that it was impossible to get shiny females when the species' gender ratio was 7:1 in favour of males. 

Also meant that Hidden Power could only ever be Grass for shiny Pok√©mon.
And even there, unown shiny odds are fucked, since some letters depending on your trainer ID have shiny odds ranging from 1/5.120 to 1/18.432 (base 1/8.192) which is the only way to ‚Äúalter‚Äù the shiny odds.
The funny thing is that in Gen 2, shinies were determined by the Pok√©mon‚Äôs IVs
    Which were sadly called DVs in Gen2
        That is true, but it was the predecessor
Also due to the way shinies were determined in Gen2 you can only get shiny male starters
This fact will always confirm that yes, my first shiny really was an "I" Unown. And that I didn't catch it because I already had that letter.
Barschuft and Barschwa, the german names contain the word "arsch", which is "ass"
I get all the others but I‚Äôm racking my brain trying to figure out the problem with Venusaur‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the bad word there?
    Apparently the word ‚Äúsau‚Äù is slang word in german
        I've learned so many bad words in other languages thanks to Pokemon and other games, including several slurs I'd never be aware of if they weren't banned from the game!
        It literally translates to "sow" (as in female pig) It's also a pretty low-intensity and fairly uncommon insult, similar to "you swine"
This is known as the Scunthorpe problem. 

Used to show up a lot on magic the gathering forums, it used to be very difficult to discuss cards like Royal ******in.
    Never realized that assassin is literally ass ass in lmao
I thought Marshtomp was banned due to "arsh" but I looked it up and maybe it was due to "sht" lol
The character limit best example is Feraligatr
    [deleted]
        Victory bell?
            You know its funny they went with Venusaur for the starter name when Victreebel is closer to a venus flytrap than Venusaur is (I'm aware its actually a pitcher plant and it's a different thing but still).

Additional fun trivia: all three Grass/Poison lines in Gen 1 are three stages and their final stage's name begins with V. Almost had all the first names with B too but Oddish ruined it.
                üÖ±Ô∏èoddish
                    The more muscular Fighting/Grass cousin.
Now there are some pokemon with 12 letter names: Crabominable	
Squawkabilly	
Brambleghast

as well as some 12 character names with the new paradox pokemon
Unfortunately, the 11 letter mons got dethroned for longest name by the 12 letter Crabominable a few years ago.
    Good find, I completely forgot that pokemon haha, I'll edit it!
I remember playing a ROM hack where they shortened it to 'Fletchindr' lmao
    Just following the precedent Game Freak set with Feraligatr.
    Ive seen "Crabminble" in a romhack lol
        I'd prefer Crabomnabl myself
    Emerald EX has to do that a lot because it still has the character limit. Blacefalon is the most disgusting shortening.
Oh. Shit.
It's meant to be delib-erd.
Signed, sealed, Deliberd
V in Japanese is substituted with B, since its name is the same in Japanese, its name is literally just Delivered
I love to think how it went mostly unnoticed in testing because the only Pokemon with Wonder Guard has a Fire weakness anyways.
    Maybe they noticed but didn't care because of that? Idk
Pok√©mon has been fine spaghetti for it's entire existence üçù
If you hack the game and bring a Wonder Guard Spiritomb/Sableye to the Battle Tower(?), the AI will actually notice this and start putting you against teams with Fire Fang more often.
    OK that is fascinating
Only reason for this as well is due to a mixup in the code.

Some moves has that semi-invulnerable state in between turns. Can't remember the exact details, but it was some indexes that got switched around iirc. This also means that you can hit a pokemon in the semi-invulnerable state after using Phantom Force with Fire Fang iirc.
Amazing work, always a bit disappointing when it's just one, huh?
You could also go through the alternative name listings in Glottolog 

Or go through ISO 639-5
Well since you are talking about languages you are kind of missing an obvious point.. lannguage. What language did you use to determine the names of the Pok√©mon? And the languages? English perhaps has only Persian, but what about others?
    That was for English names.

German and French Pok√©mon names get one unexpected match: Yuyu, the German and French name for the gen 9 legendary Chi-Yu, matches the name of an extinct Aboriginal language from Australia.

Other than those, the English name of Tapu Bulu and Tapu Lele make for some near-matches: there is a Bulu language spoken in Cameroon and three languages named Lele spoken in Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea. The second part fo the German name for Tapu Fini, *Kapu-Fala*, matches the name of the Fala language spoken by a few thousand people in Spain while *Kapu-Toro* (Tapu Bulu) matches the Toro language from Nigeria.
Things I found:

Pokemon that contain another Pokemon's name:
Parasect and Paras
Porygon2/Porygon-Z and Porygon
Kabutops and Kabuto
Klingklang and Klink/Klang
Pawmot and Pawmo
Kadabra/Crabrawler and Abra
Pyukumuku and Muk
Eternatus and Natu
Azumarill and Marill
Dudunsparce and Dunsparce
Volcarona and Aron
Swoonat and Woobat
Kilowattrel and Wattrel
Pidgeotto and Pidgeot

Pidgeotto is the only pokemon that contains the full name of a Pokemon that comes after it in the Pokedex.

Couldn't come up with a good way of checking anagrams well for everything, but there are some boring ones like Pawmo and Pawmi

Edit: Missed Mewtwo and Mew, somehow? Thanks for catching it in the comments.
    That's interesting, and thanks for your effort. Eternatus/Natu is a super cool one! I had wondered if it might be tricky to do anagrams with Regex, though.

I think the only thing you can really do computationally is sort the characters in the name alphabetically and then sort the list of alphabetised names to try and find matches/near-matches, but that's still not perfect.
    what about mewtwo/mew?
    I know there's letters in between it but Azumarill also has Azurill
    Mewtwo
I'll look into it and get back to you, cool idea!
Omanyte and Tynamo are just adding an e
I figured out how to generate every near-anagram (which I'm defining as adding, subtracting, or substituting one letter) given a list of words.

Their are four pools of five:

Gastly; Ralts; Starly; Staryu; Tauros

Mankey; Mantyke; Omanyte; Ponyta; Tynamo

Emolga; Glameow; Gloom; Golem; Goomy

Miraidon; Nidoran‚ôÄ; Nidoran‚ôÇ; Nidorina; Nidorino


Nidorina is the only Pokemon I found with four anagrams.
Pokemon dad joke, if only there were dads in Pokemon
    Koga?  Giovanni?  Norman?  Prof.  Birch?  Palmer?  Byron?
        Also Chairman Rose is a daddy
        Mohn in SM/USUM as well.

Which I just learned this week
        Keep your fan OCs to yourself. There are no dads.
            All of those characters are canonically dads in the games. Koga is Janine's Dad, Giovanni is Silvers, Norman is the player character's in Ruby, Birch is the Rival Characters, Palmer is Barry's dad and Byron is Roarks
    Who did I battle in Petalburg, then?
        Joe
            Mama
Omg lol
Best Pokemon dad joke ever lol
Might be different if they use another form of astrology üòã
    [Gen 5 actually did have its own horoscope system, though it seems to correspond with our own real world system](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Horoscope)

i didn't looked at all the names, but we have the deino line which numbers go 1, 2, and then 3.
    Artic**uno**   
Zap**dos**   
Mol**tres**

Obviously not an evolutionary line, but all clearly tied to each other.
[deleted]
Additionally, Furnifra√ü (Heatmor) and Rei√ülaus (Wimpod) are the only German pokemon names that contain the letter ·∫û in their names.

Thought this was fitting since you mentioned the √Ñ√ñ√ú ones already.
Are you sure about the Schneppke thing? You might be thinking of Shnebedeck :)
    I just tried to look up Schnebedeck, but didn't found it. So, yeah. I'm sure about the Schneppke one. But it's also weird, since apparently name changes aren't named in the trivia paragraphs. :-/
Seel is also a word. Not very commonly used and absolutely nothing to do with seals though.
    Yes. And Gloom is a valid word.
        Mr mime and mime jr as well
Gloom, Golem, Paras, Oddish, Seel, Alakazam, and Ditto also work. I‚Äôve looked through the national dex and I‚Äôm pretty sure these are the only ones. I guess GF was only putting in real words in as Pok√©mon names in gen 1. Although they did do the same thing later on, with just slightly different spellings, which they also did back then. Even as recently as Flamigo, Tsarenna, Kleavor, Gumshoos, and Falinks.
    >Alakazam

Abra and Kadabra count here too
        Abra and kadabra aren't words, abracadabra is
            I wanna reach out and grab ya
Jynx is not a word with that definition. Jinx is. However, Jynx is the genus name for a type of woodpecker.
Porygon is the only Pok√©mon that can evolve twice without leveling up
Can you? The trigger for evolution for Budew is still Lvl Up, just *at* a high friendship
    Ya but you can breed a Rosalia without it coming out as a budew
        Or transfer a level 1 budew to PLA and max it's friendship there
        Not anymore
            Such a shame. Now what will we use our Rose Incenses for?

...What do you mean the item has other functions?
                Are there still Incense items in SV? The only thing I can really see them doing is bypassing the item clause for things like Mystic Water‚Ä¶ why would you use that over Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, Life Orb or like so many other items?
            I guess you could trade a level 1 roselia from a previous gens then evolve it into Roserade and trade it up into the newer games
Level 1 Meta is wild.

Porygon Z, Roserade, Snorlax...

Lots of strong Pokemon you don't think of.
Other near misses (ruined by the last letter like Abra): Gloom, Muk, Ditto, Deoxys

Ones that got off to the wrong start (ruined by the first letter): Machop, Seel
Mew, Natu, Xatu, Raikou, Taillow, Shinx, Raboot, Rellor
    Deoxyz
        This must be the American spelling instead of the English one
    Damn, you've got some impressive analytical language skills.
        I've spent a while playing with regular expressions in my spreadsheet, that's all üò∏
            Don't sell yourself short. I use regex for work sometimes and looking over your comments even I'm impressed how fast you're answering new questions. Related, could you list the pokemon with one letter that ruins the alphabetical order, regardless of where in the name it appears?
Zubat is that way in the opposite direction
    Ones like Zubat that are reverse alphabetical except their last letter: Seel, Onix, Mew, Feebas, Spheal, Woobat, Skiddo

Ones that have only the first letter out of order: Muk, Aron, Uxie, Munna
    Didn't know about Zubat, gonna check for more near misses going backwards!
sometimes, but not generally. a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y
    Okay, but obviously in Jynx, it‚Äôs a vowel‚Ä¶
I was looking for this comment lol the vowel in Jynx is Y yea
Y is generally taught to be a consonant that can used as a vowel.
Y and W can be either consonsents or vowels, depending on how they are pronounced. 

Some people are just taught poorly in elementary school.
Curious about other cases like this, cheers!
    The most similar case is the letter Y, where all 6 Pokemon come from a different generation. Same for X, but that's less interesting since there's only 3 of them. Finally, Q is fun bc of the 7, 3 are from gen 2, 3 are from gen 9, and the last one is from gen 6. A little wonky if you ask me
        Another fact about Q, they're all water and/or starters (excluding H-Qwilfish).
        Thanks for those extra tidbits :D
        Yveltal, yanma, yanmega, yamper, yamask and who's the 6th one?
            Yungoos
Similarly the 3 Porygons came out in gens 1, 2 and 4, the powers of 2. Considering the thematic link to computer science I was really hoping for a new one in gen 8 but they broke the chain lol
For now Gen v is also the only gen to not have an I in it‚Äôs Roman numeral. Let‚Äôs see if we get a Pok√©mon starting with I next gen!
Pawmo and Pawmi are similar there.
    Forgot about those two, crap.
        Well OP is an AI that knows everything of Pok√©mon... ü§£
Porygon to Porygon2 doesn't add or remove any letters either.
somewhat related word fact, the "proper" spelling is 'minuscule', but the spelling of 'miniscule' has been accepted as a correct alternative in English due to people mishearing the first 'u' as an 'i'.

edit, from wiktionary: ‚ÄúThe correct spelling is **minuscule** rather than **miniscule**. The latter is a common error, which has arisen by analogy with other words beginning with ‚Äúmini‚Äù, where the meaning is similarly ‚Äòvery small‚Äô.‚Äù (The New Oxford Dictionary of English, Oxford University Press, 1998)
Mr. Mime and Mr. Rime
Edit:Just saw you said vowels. Whoops lol
Nidoran‚ôÄ, Nidoran‚ôÇ, Farfetch'd, Mr. Mime, Porygon2, Ho-Oh, Mime Jr., Porygon-Z, Type: Null, Jangmo-o, Hakamo-o, Kommo-o, Sirfetch'd, Mr. Rime, Ting-Lu, Chien-Pao, Wo-Chien, Chi-Yu

As well as all the paradox pokemon with a space in their name.

Ah yes, Articuno, Moldos and Zaptres.
    A M Z would be the order you catch them. You encounter Articuno first, then Moltres, then you remember the power plant after you beat the game.
    Moldos is what happens when you leave fresh guacamole out for two days
    Those don‚Äôt sound that bad lmao
Arktos, Zapdos, Lavados. Lol at german localization. Also that they translated Pound to literally Pfund, the british currency. They eventually did an errata im Gen9 and renamed it.
Another instance of something similar: Deino's evolutionary line references 1,2 and 3 in German: dEINo, ZWEIlous, hyDREIgon.
Still sad confused due to the fact that no Pok√©mon with an √± were introduced in Paldea.
Eelektross, if abilities are counted
Rellor and Rotom are Roller and Motor backwards, respectively! and Rabsca has the syllables of Scarab in reverse
    Hey! I never clued into that. That's cool.
Muk is named in the same way too
Thank Y for your service.
Hisuian Zoroark has 7 syllables
    I didn‚Äôt count this because the in-game battle doesn‚Äôt add the Hisuian part, but you are right. Ultra Necrozma technically has 5 as well
Electivire and Iron Valiant
Yup. Y is a consonant when it's at the beginning of a syllable (yes, yuck) and a vowel when it's in the middle or end (myth, shy).
    So the Y in "boy" is a vowel?
I thought Swablu only changed one type? From Normal/Flying to Dragon/Flying
Cute~
Ah yes Snomekop, the evolved form of Snom.
W a vowel?
    'The Welsh language uses ‚Äúw‚Äù as a vowel, and the English language borrows a number of words from Welsh where this is the case: ‚Äúcwm,‚Äù which means ‚Äúvalley‚Äù and pronounced sounds like ‚Äúcoom,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúcrwth,‚Äù which is a stringed instrument and pronounced sounds like ‚Äúcrooth.‚Äù'

https://bookriot.com/is-w-a-vowel/amp/
        Yeah even in Spanish w is pronounced doble u, or double u
        English gets weirder the more I learn
            English is a mutt of a language. It takes and borrows from whatevers useful and sometimes doesn't bother to follow its own rules. But its at least highly adaptable and creative.
                The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse (indicating prostitute). We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.

James D. Nicoll
    Cwm is a word
    Linguistically, W is kinda weird. It's basically a really fast "oo" sound immediately followed by a different vowel. Ex. "Water" is pronounced like "oo-Ah-ter."
        Yeah, it's pretty much two u's. A double-u, if you will.
        My Grandpa always pronounces it Hoo-ah-ter. Lol.
        And y is the same thing, being an approximant (vowel like sound that is a consonant) that is basically "ee" followed by a vowel. Arguably the native English r sound too, but it's got some real freaky stuff going on that makes it harder to directly compare
    It is a‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúDouble U‚Äù üòè
A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y and also sometimes W too
I'll add "R" as an occasional vowel.

https://youtu.be/Tjf_MOyB0K4

Basically vowels aren't letters, but sounds.
Bombirdier has a similar ability
    Bombirdier and Dhelmise are the only two Pok√©mon that have three types with a stab boost
        Any dual typed Pok√©mon terastilizing into a different type:

But as a follow-up, this means Dhelmise and Bombirdier are the only Pok√©mon to have 4 STAB boosts at once.
Arbok is kobra backwards
    And muk is‚Ä¶
        Muk is poison lol
I wonder what the isshu was with them translating it separately?
in ascending order the longest string is 6 - avalugg, noibat, noivern, xerneas, yveltal, zygarde

in descending order there are several 5s -

stunky, skuntank, bronzor, bronzong, bonsly

vullaby, mandibuzz, heatmor, durant, deino

scovillain, rellor, rabsca, flittle, espathra
    Amazing, thanks for compiling!

Looks like there is a very boring one now due to all the "Iron" paradox pokemon in a row though...

Edit: nevermind, I misread, it's not just the first letter of the names but the names themselves
What is Jynx called in German?
    Jennekin
    Rossana!
According to the German Pok√©mon Wiki it's a combo between "Rosso" (apparently Italian for red) and the name "Roxana".
Is Y never a vowel in German? That's interesting they'd do that then.
Mr. Mime ;)
Because of that Pokemon I get mixed up when writing the actual word...
You could catch it in Platinum in the trophy garden.
Same with Rellor and Amgil
In generation 5, you couldn‚Äôt trade a cofagrigus online due to profanity in its name.
    Same with Froslass
        Basculin in German is called Barschuft and thus contains the word "Arsch" (ass) hence why it can't be traded either.
            Barsch is German for bass and Arsch is German for ass. They both went through the same sound change in English (bars -> bass and arse -> ass) but you can see the origin in Barschuft's German name and the reason why the name breaks the filter :P if it were called "Bassculin" in English it would have had the same problem.
                Bassculin would also have two asses in a row!  

(*cul* being ass in French)
                As a native German speaker I know this already but thanks for further explaining it for everyone else. :)
            Just hence

Hence means ‚Äúas a consequence‚Äù or ‚Äúfor this reason‚Äù, so saying hence why is redundant and you can just say ‚Äúhence it can‚Äôt be traded either‚Äù :D
                But it doesn't really matter, hence why no one else mentioned it
    Or use it in online battles. It would be able to be used in battle or trades if m it was nicknamed.
    can‚Äôt believe cofagrigus is throwing slurs at me every time it speaks üôÑ
Pretty sure most Pokemon shit
    But have you ever seen one of them shit?
        Can‚Äôt wait for Pokemon Shit and Piss version in gen 10
            Legendaries are Excrementia and Urinia (shiny versions are green and orange respectively)
        Do...they even shit?  I mean Male torchic have visual buttholes and Stunktank shoots flamethrowers anally.
    There's quite a lot of bird Pok√©mon who probably have more of a cloaca than a colon.
Type: Null is also the only one to not use the English name in Spanish and Italian.
farfetch'd?
    You're right. Changed it
    Apostrophes are separate characters whereas diacritics are part of the vowel I think
        Person you're replying to was responding to : being the only grammatical symbol in use.
Flabebe is Moira Rose‚Äôs Pok√©mon. If you know, you know.

I have my wife to thank for this and I can‚Äôt unhear it
    I'm sure she'd have a Murkrow on her team too
    Little b√©b√© crows!
Now the ruinous quartet is added to that list of Pok√©mon with hyphenated names as well.
How do you know all this?
    Coding, spreadsheets, regular expressions, and google :)
        What about the letter rank of how many pok√©mon begin with it? (SCMGP etc.)
            S,134; C,86; M,79; G,65; T,64; P,63; D,60; B,55; A,44; F,40; L,40; R,39; H,33; K,32; W,30; E,26; V,25; N,23; I,17; O,15; Z,14; J,8; Q,7; U,7; Y,6; X,3

My dataset wasn't optimized for this sort of thing (I actually made the spreadsheet using Squirdle Data) so I pulled the data from: 
 https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_name

And then just counted and sorted it in a new spreadsheet
                S to C is such a big difference
                    Compared to the distribution for dictionaries though they're fairly proportional though, especially compared to vowels and the least frequent letters.
        as far as I remember Regex can't detect palindromes
            Could you not use TEXTJOIN and MID to reverse the names in a separate columns then run a formula to compare the two?
                Oh really, I'm not too experienced I just learned abt it passively in a class. My professor told me Regex couldn't detect palindromes cause it couldnt look into the future, but maybe he was just talking in scope of the class or Ruby regex specifically.
                    There are some versions of regexes that do have forward looking characters, the one I use in Google sheets does not have that functionality though.

Palindromes are just well documented and I did some searching recently.

If I was looking for palindromes though I'd just use a spreadsheet function, take the first half of the characters and compare vs the last half.
            You are correct. It's impossible. Although, it can easily be done through code.
                Right, you could do it pretty easily with Python string slicing.

edit - quick bodge:

    def palindrome_check(input_string):
        halfway = int(len(input_string)/2)
        return input_string[:halfway] == input_string[-halfway:][::-1]
    Uncle works at Nintendo
Well there's mew, obviously not a palindrome, but you can rotate it 180¬∞ and it'll be the same.
Do it anyways
But thats its whole gimmick with its two heads
    It's a gimmick that apparently went right over my head, lol.
        And your tail
            And my axe
                And that guy's dead wife
                And your other axe taped handle to handle with the first one
                    Double-bladed axe:  ... *dude* ... I was *right here*
        To add to the gimmick, it's name in Japanese is telekinesis giraffe, which is a palindrome in Japanese kanji
        It was more blatant in the beta design
Thats like its entire gimmick lol

I wish they had used the beta design where it was double ended, it looked way better than the weird tail head.
Not only is that its whole gimmick, they even reversed the palindrome with Farigiraf...
Its name in Japanese translates to Giraffe Telekinesis which is also a palindrome in Japanese. Probably why it was changed from a normal/dark in the beta to a normal/psychic in the final version of Gold and Silver.
Same here, I think it‚Äôs because I had no clue whatsoever that name is supposed to be pronounced. I just see a big mess of letters and don‚Äôt even try to sound it out. Once I heard it said out loud I was able to notice the palindrome
    I keep pronouncing it giraffe-a-rig in my head.
Here to paste the same thing. I feel better knowing there are two of us.
If you count Yellow as Gen 1 which it is, then Farfetch‚Äôd is available on routes 12 and 13. I remember because it was in my Pok√©mon Yellow guidebook and I caught my first one there cause I didn‚Äôt care for Dux.
    Damn, missed that when I was looking stuff up, didn't see that this was just for Red and Blue:

https://www.serebii.net/rb/trades.shtml
        Yep! You can also catch Lickitung in Cerulean Cave in Yellow as well! Yellow made a lot of the trade poke‚Äôs available in the wild.
            I think they swapped the trades with the starters in Yellow, no? You get given Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander fairly early on, and I know one of them is just north of Nugget Bridge.
                They did swap a few but Jynx and Mr. Mime are still trades in Yellow. And yeah Squirtle is in Vermillion, Charmander across nugget bridge and Bulbasaur in a house in Cerulean. 

I love yellow. Having all the starters is the best.
                    I miss that game so much
                    Just finished a Nuzlocke of Yellow! It was so much fun, I hadn‚Äôt played that game in so long
            Yellow also let you get a level 5 Machamp via a Cubone for Machoke trade.

Send back a hatched Cubone from GSC and do the trade.
    You can also catch Jynx and Lickitung in Japan's Blue Version. Jynx is in the Seafoam Islands and Lickitung is in the Safari Zone.
        I like Lickitung being in the Safari Zone better than in the Cerulean Cave like it is in Yellow. They should retroactively change that. Haha.
            Considering it evolves in Sinnoh, it could just be native there instead of Kanto. Obviously it‚Äôs not the only Sinnoh Evo Pokemon to be exclusive to the Safari Zone in RB, so throw in Rhyhorn too
I remember for a while me and my brother were convinced Ash‚Äôs Pikachu was a girl because I traded him from Yellow which had no gender to Silver which gendered him as female.
    You can trade the yellow pikachu?
        Yep! It's actually just a regular Pikachu as far as the other games are concerned üòÖ
            Even as far as Yellow is concerned.

The game only has special rules for the first Pikachu you encounter. If you change your starter through glitches, etc., and encounter a Pikachu later, it'll start following you as soon as you catch it.
        It's part of the loophole to evolve your starter Pikachu in Yellow.  
   
Trade it to Red/Blue, evolve it, and trade it back to Yellow.
        If you're a horrible person you can trade the pikachu, evolve to raichu, and then trade back to yellow with your now raichu.
Good old Dux
I only ever figured out how to get to the grass inside the Ruins of Alph once and for some reason I could never find my way back there, so I didn‚Äôt even know Natu existed until I saw it in Stadium 2 (and something similar happened with Gligar, nobody I knew had Gold or Crystal, we all had Silver)
Gyarados was called Skullkraken in the beta, but had to be renamed due to the character limit.
    Ok now I want a regional variant or a paradox form of Gyarados with the name Skullkraken.
        A dark type gyrados with that name would be so cool, mostly black body with a grey face shaped like a skull with horns/spikes.
            Use this site -> https://aegide.github.io/



And put in Gyarados and Duskull in the two boxes and fuse. Does that match your description?
                Yes it is somewhat similar to what I was thinking
        That would be called a convergent species, like toedscruel.
            Or it could be a paradox Pokemon. A past version named Skull Kraken would be fine. Or a regional variant where the regional variant has an extra evolution, as we have already seen before. With a convergent species you'd expect the name to be similar like with other convergent species.
    Thankfully. Gyarados is so much better.
    That's true. I'm going to assume that names that could still make sense when they're shortened (Victreebel instead of bell, Feraligatr instead of Feraligator) when still kept.
        I mean they could have just done Skulkraken.
            What the heck is a raken and why does it skulk?
                Same reason a mewt wos.
                    Mewt Wos is a clone of Mewt. If you clone Wewt Wos again, you get Mewt Wosn't.
            Get outta here with your logic!
So I guess Vespiquen is not meant to be Vespiqueen? Very interesting
Makes it sound like an early 2000s website √† la Tumblr
    Feraligrindr
        I mean, we've all seen his GSC back sprite, right?
            Gen 3, GSC cut him off at the arms. 

Also unfortunately it‚Äôs not even cake, dude has a tail, and typically that doesn‚Äôt sit like a foot below the thiccness!
Digraphs have entered the chat.
Also froslass and nosepass+probopass
    Interesting, I am used to language filters not caring about ass, but I suppose that's because I'm used to them in more human based games. The reason is that it looks dumb as hell when assassin gets censored.
        Lol. "The in is killing everyone! The in is hiding in there!"
    Clbuttic profanity filtering.
And Conkeldurr
    What is profane in conkeldurr?
        Conk, durr.
Took me way too long to find the profanity lol
I'm surprised I never saw "OP is a Cofagrigus," back when that would have been a funny and acceptable joke on Reddit.
    I saw it on a different site I think
now im gonna pronounce gallade as galadee, so it sounds like lad
    All Gallade or bow Scottish.
>NidoQUEEN, NidoKING

Lmao did you really need to point that one out with caps?
Kinda like GoldEEN and SeaKING right?
    Except they can be either gender. Nidoking is male only, Nidoqueen is female only
I‚Äôm 99% sure Gallade‚Äôs name has nothing to do with lad. It‚Äôs Gallant Blade.
Yeah and Ultra Beasts are better named in Spanish too, ‚ÄúUltraentes‚Äù. Really like that ‚ÄúUltra wormholes‚Äùwere called ‚ÄúUltraumbrales‚Äù and not something like ‚ÄúUltra agujeros de gusano‚Äù

Also the name of the Ultraentes use the japanese name, like Nihilego it‚Äôs UE-01 parasito.
    That's honestly sick af
    Yeah spanish names are better overall, but somehow they still fill dialogue with idioms that nobody ever understands lmao
[deleted]
It's a fairly common fan theory, actually, that Type:Null is a subtle callback to Missingno.
It's meant to be Ultra High Frequency
    Weird Al's greatest work
        WHEEL. OF. FISH!!!!
            YOU GET: NOTHIIIIING!!! STUUUUUUPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIID!!!!!
                Turtles are nature's suction cups!
                    CONAN THE LIBRARIAN!
    Ultra High Frequency AND a play on the mythological nordic dragon Fafnir.
UHF stands for Ultra-High-Frequency.  And it's pre evolution is called eF-eM.
    And if I'm right in thinking, eF-eM is the only one whose name doesn't start with a capital letter in a language
You missed Ho-Oh
    Are both parts of Ho-oh‚Äôs name capitalized? I thought it was just the first part

Edit: yeah after looking it up every official source I could find said it‚Äôs Ho-Oh. Dunno why I thought it was Ho-oh.
        Early TCG prints have the name as Ho-oh (with the lower case second 'o'), so even Pok√©mon couldn't decide early on. Blame them!
I‚Äôm going to guess they‚Äôre talking about multiple capital letters in the same word. Your examples all include either hyphenations, abbreviations (e.g. Jr.) or two distinct words. German Noivern is literally ‚ÄúUHaFnir‚Äù, no spaces, periods, or hypens. I don‚Äôt know this for sure, but going to guess there aren‚Äôt any examples in English that follow the same rule of multiple capitals within the same unique word.
    Their example was UHaFnir being the only Pok√©mon name in any language with more than 2 capital letters at all, and I just got curious as to how many English names have exactly 2, since every Pok√©mon has at least one.
DW, Germans get confused too, just slightly less
Yeah I pulled a German Noivern V and almost thought it was an error at first. It's a really cool name.
Xikachu, the evolution of Pikablu. üòÇ
Oh Xurkitree? But he's an ultra beast. Not a Pokemon right?
    Ultra Beasts are just alien pokemon. Like if you found a deer on Mars, you would maybe classify it as it's own thing but close enough to an earth Deer that most people won't consider the disctinction
        You wouldn't call it a deer, but you would probably call it an animal.
            You underestimate humans' ability to give similar names to completely unrelated species.
                You underestimate humans' ability to be annoyingly pedantic.
    UBs are Pokemon. They can be captured in Pokeballs, used in Pokemon  battles, stored in Pokemon Storage Systems, learn Pokemon moves, have Pokemon typing....
    Tomato tom√†to
    Ultra Beasts are Pokemon from another dimension.
Basculegion also has all the main vowels (vowels that are only vowels, not consonants) in its name.
woah, you're like a wizard! okay, let me think of one.

are there any pokemon names with 3+ of the same letter?

or if that's a dumb question, what's the reverse of deino (reverse alphabetical order)?
    [deleted]
        OMG
        I‚Äôm guessing also the only Pok√©mon with only two different letters in its name?
            Ho-Oh
                Foiled again by these meddling kids‚Ä¶
    Altaria, Serperior, Rhyperior, Electivire, Hoothoot, Kartana, Celesteela, Thundurus, Garganacl too, some others as well but i'm not gonna search for it (those i got from my head ngl)
    [deleted]
        Evolves into *Missouri*
    Raising the stakes a bit to: Pokemon with the most of a single letter in it's name.

Including form names, 5 repetitions: Alolan Rattata (a); Oricorio Pom-Pom Style (o)

Otherwise, 4 repetitions: Alakazam (a); Eevee (e)
        And Steenee, Celesteela
    My Regex had an error, someone caught pokemon I was missing and it's fixed now.

Most repetition with a form name is actually: Galarian Darmanitan Standard Mode (8 a's)

Without forms is still four but includes way more pokemon: 

Alakazam, Eevee, Hoothoot, Sudowoodo, Beheeyem, Steenee, Pyukumuku, Celesteela, Stakataka, Wooloo, Perrserker, Indeedee

Not me being a dumbass saying "wait a min... Air isnt a type and Dragonair doesnt fit here"


Im clearly a dumbass.
Would Clefairy be intentional if it was named before the Fairy type existed? Like, the name was definitely meant to allude to a "fairy", but I doubt that GameFreak had the Fairy type in mind yet, considering they added two new types in Gen 2 and could have done it then.
I believe the reliance on DVs also meant that it was impossible to get shiny females when the species' gender ratio was 7:1 in favour of males. 

Also meant that Hidden Power could only ever be Grass for shiny Pok√©mon.
Which were sadly called DVs in Gen2
    That is true, but it was the predecessor
Apparently the word ‚Äúsau‚Äù is slang word in german
    I've learned so many bad words in other languages thanks to Pokemon and other games, including several slurs I'd never be aware of if they weren't banned from the game!
    It literally translates to "sow" (as in female pig) It's also a pretty low-intensity and fairly uncommon insult, similar to "you swine"
Never realized that assassin is literally ass ass in lmao

    Victory bell?
        You know its funny they went with Venusaur for the starter name when Victreebel is closer to a venus flytrap than Venusaur is (I'm aware its actually a pitcher plant and it's a different thing but still).

Additional fun trivia: all three Grass/Poison lines in Gen 1 are three stages and their final stage's name begins with V. Almost had all the first names with B too but Oddish ruined it.

Good find, I completely forgot that pokemon haha, I'll edit it!
Just following the precedent Game Freak set with Feraligatr.
Ive seen "Crabminble" in a romhack lol
    I'd prefer Crabomnabl myself
Emerald EX has to do that a lot because it still has the character limit. Blacefalon is the most disgusting shortening.
Maybe they noticed but didn't care because of that? Idk
OK that is fascinating
That was for English names.

German and French Pok√©mon names get one unexpected match: Yuyu, the German and French name for the gen 9 legendary Chi-Yu, matches the name of an extinct Aboriginal language from Australia.

Other than those, the English name of Tapu Bulu and Tapu Lele make for some near-matches: there is a Bulu language spoken in Cameroon and three languages named Lele spoken in Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea. The second part fo the German name for Tapu Fini, *Kapu-Fala*, matches the name of the Fala language spoken by a few thousand people in Spain while *Kapu-Toro* (Tapu Bulu) matches the Toro language from Nigeria.
That's interesting, and thanks for your effort. Eternatus/Natu is a super cool one! I had wondered if it might be tricky to do anagrams with Regex, though.

I think the only thing you can really do computationally is sort the characters in the name alphabetically and then sort the list of alphabetised names to try and find matches/near-matches, but that's still not perfect.
what about mewtwo/mew?
I know there's letters in between it but Azumarill also has Azurill
Mewtwo
Koga?  Giovanni?  Norman?  Prof.  Birch?  Palmer?  Byron?
    Also Chairman Rose is a daddy
    Mohn in SM/USUM as well.

Which I just learned this week
    Keep your fan OCs to yourself. There are no dads.
        All of those characters are canonically dads in the games. Koga is Janine's Dad, Giovanni is Silvers, Norman is the player character's in Ruby, Birch is the Rival Characters, Palmer is Barry's dad and Byron is Roarks

Obviously not an evolutionary line, but all clearly tied to each other.
I just tried to look up Schnebedeck, but didn't found it. So, yeah. I'm sure about the Schneppke one. But it's also weird, since apparently name changes aren't named in the trivia paragraphs. :-/
Yes. And Gloom is a valid word.

Abra and Kadabra count here too
    Abra and kadabra aren't words, abracadabra is

Ya but you can breed a Rosalia without it coming out as a budew
    Or transfer a level 1 budew to PLA and max it's friendship there
    Not anymore
        Such a shame. Now what will we use our Rose Incenses for?

...What do you mean the item has other functions?
            Are there still Incense items in SV? The only thing I can really see them doing is bypassing the item clause for things like Mystic Water‚Ä¶ why would you use that over Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, Life Orb or like so many other items?
        I guess you could trade a level 1 roselia from a previous gens then evolve it into Roserade and trade it up into the newer games

    This must be the American spelling instead of the English one
Damn, you've got some impressive analytical language skills.
    I've spent a while playing with regular expressions in my spreadsheet, that's all üò∏
        Don't sell yourself short. I use regex for work sometimes and looking over your comments even I'm impressed how fast you're answering new questions. Related, could you list the pokemon with one letter that ruins the alphabetical order, regardless of where in the name it appears?
Ones like Zubat that are reverse alphabetical except their last letter: Seel, Onix, Mew, Feebas, Spheal, Woobat, Skiddo

Ones that have only the first letter out of order: Muk, Aron, Uxie, Munna
Didn't know about Zubat, gonna check for more near misses going backwards!
Okay, but obviously in Jynx, it‚Äôs a vowel‚Ä¶
The most similar case is the letter Y, where all 6 Pokemon come from a different generation. Same for X, but that's less interesting since there's only 3 of them. Finally, Q is fun bc of the 7, 3 are from gen 2, 3 are from gen 9, and the last one is from gen 6. A little wonky if you ask me
    Another fact about Q, they're all water and/or starters (excluding H-Qwilfish).
    Thanks for those extra tidbits :D
    Yveltal, yanma, yanmega, yamper, yamask and who's the 6th one?

A M Z would be the order you catch them. You encounter Articuno first, then Moltres, then you remember the power plant after you beat the game.
Moldos is what happens when you leave fresh guacamole out for two days
Those don‚Äôt sound that bad lmao
Hey! I never clued into that. That's cool.
I didn‚Äôt count this because the in-game battle doesn‚Äôt add the Hisuian part, but you are right. Ultra Necrozma technically has 5 as well
So the Y in "boy" is a vowel?
'The Welsh language uses ‚Äúw‚Äù as a vowel, and the English language borrows a number of words from Welsh where this is the case: ‚Äúcwm,‚Äù which means ‚Äúvalley‚Äù and pronounced sounds like ‚Äúcoom,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúcrwth,‚Äù which is a stringed instrument and pronounced sounds like ‚Äúcrooth.‚Äù'

https://bookriot.com/is-w-a-vowel/amp/
    Yeah even in Spanish w is pronounced doble u, or double u
    English gets weirder the more I learn
        English is a mutt of a language. It takes and borrows from whatevers useful and sometimes doesn't bother to follow its own rules. But its at least highly adaptable and creative.
            The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse (indicating prostitute). We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.

James D. Nicoll
Cwm is a word
Linguistically, W is kinda weird. It's basically a really fast "oo" sound immediately followed by a different vowel. Ex. "Water" is pronounced like "oo-Ah-ter."
    Yeah, it's pretty much two u's. A double-u, if you will.
    My Grandpa always pronounces it Hoo-ah-ter. Lol.
    And y is the same thing, being an approximant (vowel like sound that is a consonant) that is basically "ee" followed by a vowel. Arguably the native English r sound too, but it's got some real freaky stuff going on that makes it harder to directly compare
It is a‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúDouble U‚Äù üòè
Bombirdier and Dhelmise are the only two Pok√©mon that have three types with a stab boost
    Any dual typed Pok√©mon terastilizing into a different type:

But as a follow-up, this means Dhelmise and Bombirdier are the only Pok√©mon to have 4 STAB boosts at once.
And muk is‚Ä¶
    Muk is poison lol
Amazing, thanks for compiling!

Looks like there is a very boring one now due to all the "Iron" paradox pokemon in a row though...

Edit: nevermind, I misread, it's not just the first letter of the names but the names themselves
Jennekin
Rossana!
According to the German Pok√©mon Wiki it's a combo between "Rosso" (apparently Italian for red) and the name "Roxana".
Same with Froslass
    Basculin in German is called Barschuft and thus contains the word "Arsch" (ass) hence why it can't be traded either.
        Barsch is German for bass and Arsch is German for ass. They both went through the same sound change in English (bars -> bass and arse -> ass) but you can see the origin in Barschuft's German name and the reason why the name breaks the filter :P if it were called "Bassculin" in English it would have had the same problem.
            Bassculin would also have two asses in a row!  

(*cul* being ass in French)
            As a native German speaker I know this already but thanks for further explaining it for everyone else. :)
        Just hence

Hence means ‚Äúas a consequence‚Äù or ‚Äúfor this reason‚Äù, so saying hence why is redundant and you can just say ‚Äúhence it can‚Äôt be traded either‚Äù :D
            But it doesn't really matter, hence why no one else mentioned it
Or use it in online battles. It would be able to be used in battle or trades if m it was nicknamed.
can‚Äôt believe cofagrigus is throwing slurs at me every time it speaks üôÑ
But have you ever seen one of them shit?
    Can‚Äôt wait for Pokemon Shit and Piss version in gen 10

    Do...they even shit?  I mean Male torchic have visual buttholes and Stunktank shoots flamethrowers anally.
There's quite a lot of bird Pok√©mon who probably have more of a cloaca than a colon.
You're right. Changed it
Apostrophes are separate characters whereas diacritics are part of the vowel I think
    Person you're replying to was responding to : being the only grammatical symbol in use.
I'm sure she'd have a Murkrow on her team too
Little b√©b√© crows!
Coding, spreadsheets, regular expressions, and google :)
    What about the letter rank of how many pok√©mon begin with it? (SCMGP etc.)
        S,134; C,86; M,79; G,65; T,64; P,63; D,60; B,55; A,44; F,40; L,40; R,39; H,33; K,32; W,30; E,26; V,25; N,23; I,17; O,15; Z,14; J,8; Q,7; U,7; Y,6; X,3

My dataset wasn't optimized for this sort of thing (I actually made the spreadsheet using Squirdle Data) so I pulled the data from: 
 https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_name

And then just counted and sorted it in a new spreadsheet
            S to C is such a big difference
                Compared to the distribution for dictionaries though they're fairly proportional though, especially compared to vowels and the least frequent letters.
    as far as I remember Regex can't detect palindromes
        Could you not use TEXTJOIN and MID to reverse the names in a separate columns then run a formula to compare the two?
            Oh really, I'm not too experienced I just learned abt it passively in a class. My professor told me Regex couldn't detect palindromes cause it couldnt look into the future, but maybe he was just talking in scope of the class or Ruby regex specifically.
                There are some versions of regexes that do have forward looking characters, the one I use in Google sheets does not have that functionality though.

Palindromes are just well documented and I did some searching recently.

If I was looking for palindromes though I'd just use a spreadsheet function, take the first half of the characters and compare vs the last half.
        You are correct. It's impossible. Although, it can easily be done through code.
            Right, you could do it pretty easily with Python string slicing.

edit - quick bodge:

    def palindrome_check(input_string):
        halfway = int(len(input_string)/2)
        return input_string[:halfway] == input_string[-halfway:][::-1]

It's a gimmick that apparently went right over my head, lol.
    And your tail
        And my axe
            And that guy's dead wife
            And your other axe taped handle to handle with the first one
                Double-bladed axe:  ... *dude* ... I was *right here*
    To add to the gimmick, it's name in Japanese is telekinesis giraffe, which is a palindrome in Japanese kanji
    It was more blatant in the beta design
I keep pronouncing it giraffe-a-rig in my head.
Damn, missed that when I was looking stuff up, didn't see that this was just for Red and Blue:

https://www.serebii.net/rb/trades.shtml
    Yep! You can also catch Lickitung in Cerulean Cave in Yellow as well! Yellow made a lot of the trade poke‚Äôs available in the wild.
        I think they swapped the trades with the starters in Yellow, no? You get given Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander fairly early on, and I know one of them is just north of Nugget Bridge.
            They did swap a few but Jynx and Mr. Mime are still trades in Yellow. And yeah Squirtle is in Vermillion, Charmander across nugget bridge and Bulbasaur in a house in Cerulean. 

I love yellow. Having all the starters is the best.
                I miss that game so much
                Just finished a Nuzlocke of Yellow! It was so much fun, I hadn‚Äôt played that game in so long
        Yellow also let you get a level 5 Machamp via a Cubone for Machoke trade.

Send back a hatched Cubone from GSC and do the trade.
You can also catch Jynx and Lickitung in Japan's Blue Version. Jynx is in the Seafoam Islands and Lickitung is in the Safari Zone.
    I like Lickitung being in the Safari Zone better than in the Cerulean Cave like it is in Yellow. They should retroactively change that. Haha.
        Considering it evolves in Sinnoh, it could just be native there instead of Kanto. Obviously it‚Äôs not the only Sinnoh Evo Pokemon to be exclusive to the Safari Zone in RB, so throw in Rhyhorn too
You can trade the yellow pikachu?
    Yep! It's actually just a regular Pikachu as far as the other games are concerned üòÖ
        Even as far as Yellow is concerned.

The game only has special rules for the first Pikachu you encounter. If you change your starter through glitches, etc., and encounter a Pikachu later, it'll start following you as soon as you catch it.
    It's part of the loophole to evolve your starter Pikachu in Yellow.  
   
Trade it to Red/Blue, evolve it, and trade it back to Yellow.
    If you're a horrible person you can trade the pikachu, evolve to raichu, and then trade back to yellow with your now raichu.
Ok now I want a regional variant or a paradox form of Gyarados with the name Skullkraken.
    A dark type gyrados with that name would be so cool, mostly black body with a grey face shaped like a skull with horns/spikes.
        Use this site -> https://aegide.github.io/



And put in Gyarados and Duskull in the two boxes and fuse. Does that match your description?
            Yes it is somewhat similar to what I was thinking
    That would be called a convergent species, like toedscruel.
        Or it could be a paradox Pokemon. A past version named Skull Kraken would be fine. Or a regional variant where the regional variant has an extra evolution, as we have already seen before. With a convergent species you'd expect the name to be similar like with other convergent species.
Thankfully. Gyarados is so much better.
That's true. I'm going to assume that names that could still make sense when they're shortened (Victreebel instead of bell, Feraligatr instead of Feraligator) when still kept.
    I mean they could have just done Skulkraken.
        What the heck is a raken and why does it skulk?
            Same reason a mewt wos.
                Mewt Wos is a clone of Mewt. If you clone Wewt Wos again, you get Mewt Wosn't.
        Get outta here with your logic!
Feraligrindr
    I mean, we've all seen his GSC back sprite, right?
        Gen 3, GSC cut him off at the arms. 

Also unfortunately it‚Äôs not even cake, dude has a tail, and typically that doesn‚Äôt sit like a foot below the thiccness!
Interesting, I am used to language filters not caring about ass, but I suppose that's because I'm used to them in more human based games. The reason is that it looks dumb as hell when assassin gets censored.

And if I'm right in thinking, eF-eM is the only one whose name doesn't start with a capital letter in a language
Are both parts of Ho-oh‚Äôs name capitalized? I thought it was just the first part

Edit: yeah after looking it up every official source I could find said it‚Äôs Ho-Oh. Dunno why I thought it was Ho-oh.
    Early TCG prints have the name as Ho-oh (with the lower case second 'o'), so even Pok√©mon couldn't decide early on. Blame them!
Their example was UHaFnir being the only Pok√©mon name in any language with more than 2 capital letters at all, and I just got curious as to how many English names have exactly 2, since every Pok√©mon has at least one.
Ultra Beasts are just alien pokemon. Like if you found a deer on Mars, you would maybe classify it as it's own thing but close enough to an earth Deer that most people won't consider the disctinction
    You wouldn't call it a deer, but you would probably call it an animal.
        You underestimate humans' ability to give similar names to completely unrelated species.
            You underestimate humans' ability to be annoyingly pedantic.
UBs are Pokemon. They can be captured in Pokeballs, used in Pokemon  battles, stored in Pokemon Storage Systems, learn Pokemon moves, have Pokemon typing....

    S,134; C,86; M,79; G,65; T,64; P,63; D,60; B,55; A,44; F,40; L,40; R,39; H,33; K,32; W,30; E,26; V,25; N,23; I,17; O,15; Z,14; J,8; Q,7; U,7; Y,6; X,3

My dataset wasn't optimized for this sort of thing (I actually made the spreadsheet using Squirdle Data) so I pulled the data from: 
 https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_name

And then just counted and sorted it in a new spreadsheet
        S to C is such a big difference
            Compared to the distribution for dictionaries though they're fairly proportional though, especially compared to vowels and the least frequent letters.
as far as I remember Regex can't detect palindromes
    Could you not use TEXTJOIN and MID to reverse the names in a separate columns then run a formula to compare the two?
        Oh really, I'm not too experienced I just learned abt it passively in a class. My professor told me Regex couldn't detect palindromes cause it couldnt look into the future, but maybe he was just talking in scope of the class or Ruby regex specifically.
            There are some versions of regexes that do have forward looking characters, the one I use in Google sheets does not have that functionality though.

Palindromes are just well documented and I did some searching recently.

If I was looking for palindromes though I'd just use a spreadsheet function, take the first half of the characters and compare vs the last half.
    You are correct. It's impossible. Although, it can easily be done through code.
        Right, you could do it pretty easily with Python string slicing.

edit - quick bodge:

    def palindrome_check(input_string):
        halfway = int(len(input_string)/2)
        return input_string[:halfway] == input_string[-halfway:][::-1]
And your tail
    And my axe
        And that guy's dead wife
        And your other axe taped handle to handle with the first one
            Double-bladed axe:  ... *dude* ... I was *right here*
To add to the gimmick, it's name in Japanese is telekinesis giraffe, which is a palindrome in Japanese kanji
It was more blatant in the beta design
Yep! You can also catch Lickitung in Cerulean Cave in Yellow as well! Yellow made a lot of the trade poke‚Äôs available in the wild.
    I think they swapped the trades with the starters in Yellow, no? You get given Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander fairly early on, and I know one of them is just north of Nugget Bridge.
        They did swap a few but Jynx and Mr. Mime are still trades in Yellow. And yeah Squirtle is in Vermillion, Charmander across nugget bridge and Bulbasaur in a house in Cerulean. 

I love yellow. Having all the starters is the best.
            I miss that game so much
            Just finished a Nuzlocke of Yellow! It was so much fun, I hadn‚Äôt played that game in so long
    Yellow also let you get a level 5 Machamp via a Cubone for Machoke trade.

Send back a hatched Cubone from GSC and do the trade.
I like Lickitung being in the Safari Zone better than in the Cerulean Cave like it is in Yellow. They should retroactively change that. Haha.
    Considering it evolves in Sinnoh, it could just be native there instead of Kanto. Obviously it‚Äôs not the only Sinnoh Evo Pokemon to be exclusive to the Safari Zone in RB, so throw in Rhyhorn too
Yep! It's actually just a regular Pikachu as far as the other games are concerned üòÖ
    Even as far as Yellow is concerned.

The game only has special rules for the first Pikachu you encounter. If you change your starter through glitches, etc., and encounter a Pikachu later, it'll start following you as soon as you catch it.
It's part of the loophole to evolve your starter Pikachu in Yellow.  
   
Trade it to Red/Blue, evolve it, and trade it back to Yellow.
If you're a horrible person you can trade the pikachu, evolve to raichu, and then trade back to yellow with your now raichu.
A dark type gyrados with that name would be so cool, mostly black body with a grey face shaped like a skull with horns/spikes.

And put in Gyarados and Duskull in the two boxes and fuse. Does that match your description?
        Yes it is somewhat similar to what I was thinking
That would be called a convergent species, like toedscruel.
    Or it could be a paradox Pokemon. A past version named Skull Kraken would be fine. Or a regional variant where the regional variant has an extra evolution, as we have already seen before. With a convergent species you'd expect the name to be similar like with other convergent species.
I mean they could have just done Skulkraken.
    What the heck is a raken and why does it skulk?
        Same reason a mewt wos.
            Mewt Wos is a clone of Mewt. If you clone Wewt Wos again, you get Mewt Wosn't.
    Get outta here with your logic!
I mean, we've all seen his GSC back sprite, right?
    Gen 3, GSC cut him off at the arms. 

Also unfortunately it‚Äôs not even cake, dude has a tail, and typically that doesn‚Äôt sit like a foot below the thiccness!
Lol. "The in is killing everyone! The in is hiding in there!"

Early TCG prints have the name as Ho-oh (with the lower case second 'o'), so even Pok√©mon couldn't decide early on. Blame them!
You wouldn't call it a deer, but you would probably call it an animal.
    You underestimate humans' ability to give similar names to completely unrelated species.
        You underestimate humans' ability to be annoyingly pedantic.
OMG
I‚Äôm guessing also the only Pok√©mon with only two different letters in its name?
    Ho-Oh
        Foiled again by these meddling kids‚Ä¶
Evolves into *Missouri*
And Steenee, Celesteela

You know its funny they went with Venusaur for the starter name when Victreebel is closer to a venus flytrap than Venusaur is (I'm aware its actually a pitcher plant and it's a different thing but still).

Additional fun trivia: all three Grass/Poison lines in Gen 1 are three stages and their final stage's name begins with V. Almost had all the first names with B too but Oddish ruined it.

        The more muscular Fighting/Grass cousin.
All of those characters are canonically dads in the games. Koga is Janine's Dad, Giovanni is Silvers, Norman is the player character's in Ruby, Birch is the Rival Characters, Palmer is Barry's dad and Byron is Roarks

Such a shame. Now what will we use our Rose Incenses for?

...What do you mean the item has other functions?
    Are there still Incense items in SV? The only thing I can really see them doing is bypassing the item clause for things like Mystic Water‚Ä¶ why would you use that over Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, Life Orb or like so many other items?
I guess you could trade a level 1 roselia from a previous gens then evolve it into Roserade and trade it up into the newer games
Don't sell yourself short. I use regex for work sometimes and looking over your comments even I'm impressed how fast you're answering new questions. Related, could you list the pokemon with one letter that ruins the alphabetical order, regardless of where in the name it appears?

English is a mutt of a language. It takes and borrows from whatevers useful and sometimes doesn't bother to follow its own rules. But its at least highly adaptable and creative.
    The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse (indicating prostitute). We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.

Barsch is German for bass and Arsch is German for ass. They both went through the same sound change in English (bars -> bass and arse -> ass) but you can see the origin in Barschuft's German name and the reason why the name breaks the filter :P if it were called "Bassculin" in English it would have had the same problem.
    Bassculin would also have two asses in a row!  

(*cul* being ass in French)
    As a native German speaker I know this already but thanks for further explaining it for everyone else. :)
Just hence

Hence means ‚Äúas a consequence‚Äù or ‚Äúfor this reason‚Äù, so saying hence why is redundant and you can just say ‚Äúhence it can‚Äôt be traded either‚Äù :D
    But it doesn't really matter, hence why no one else mentioned it
