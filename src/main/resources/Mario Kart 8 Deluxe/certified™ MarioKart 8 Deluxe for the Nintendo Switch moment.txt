[[certified™ MarioKart 8 Deluxe for the Nintendo Switch moment]]





Rember when the meta made it possible to see any character in online
    Nope
Typical
IT’S-A ME

WA-HA-**HEEEEEEEE**
What im surprised by isnt that they are all waluigis its that they all ahve the same kart with the same wheels
    one of them was using varmint roller, but yeah, kinda silly. even the guy in last was doing the WWR combo, but it’s hard to see because switch capture-phone always uber-jpegs the image for me lol
        Yeah i noticed not all of them were waluigis and not all of them had the same kart and wheels combo, also what is WWR combo
            ah sorry, WWR is supposed to stand for Waluigi Wiggler Roller, but that’s not an official term or anything it’s just something me and my friends call it.
I honestly just hate Waluigi at this point
Is that just like the best kart build or something? I started using it before playing online bc I liked the colors w my character but everyone is rocking that combo so I had to switch it up
    yeah, iirc it was recently proven to be even better than bidybuggy roller as the supremely optimal combo, but don’t quote me on that I could be wrong
Variety is stupid and generic is not
Is that really how bad the virgin meta has gotten
Nope
