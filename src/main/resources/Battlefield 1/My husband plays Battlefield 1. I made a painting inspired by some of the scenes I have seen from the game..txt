[[My husband plays Battlefield 1. I made a painting inspired by some of the scenes I have seen from the game.]]





The soldier in the gas mask looks like some sort of spectre of war, and not a human being. Something beyond. 

I love it 
    Reminds me of Otto Dix's paintings of the war.  
  
[Excuse the source](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/may/14/art-apocalypse-otto-dix-first-world-war-der-krieg-in-pictures)
        What's wrong with The Guardian?
            Nothing really.  
  
I had two tabs open, and used that one while thinking of the other. My bad.
            I've heard it's the UK equivalent of Fox News
                Not at all, the Guardian is quite informed and very slightly left-wing, other 'tabloids' like the Daily Mail are more like Fox - right, sensationalist etc.
                    That's right, it was the daily mail. My bad. 
        I'm always amazed at people who have such large mental library of artists they can just reference them like that. 

Thanks.
        You have no idea how long I have been looking for that collection. Thank you. 
    Perhaps a MINISTER OF DEATH PRAYING FOR WAR?
Nice 👍🏻 my wife-to be grabs the controller off me and makes shrieking noises whilst plunging the hatchet into people...

Edit: typo
    She's a keeper.
        no she's a medic
            But does she revive?
                [deleted]
                    hey there are dozens of us! 

Sincerely, a medic who has saved his team many times. 
                        Medic main btw
                            morphine does a surprising amount of damage
                                Got my first syringe kill the other day, while, might I add, attempting to revive a squad mate, and I was very satisfied.
                                    Same here! I revived a squad mate in a trench right as an enemy hopped in the trench! I didn't have enough time to switch weapons, so I syringed him out of panic and got the kill! So excited
                                /r/overwatch leaks everywhere
                        i get myself killed all the time running halfway across open fields to revive someone only for the to respawn as i pull out the syringe.

If a medic is running towards you then wait dammit!
                            Bruh, you gotta triage.  If there's one dead teammate and 3 living enemy dudes, either shoot them or leave that teammate.  It's not worth your own death to save someone who will get shot anyway.
                                i dont know where the fuck you were raised but where i come from WE LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND GOD DAMMIT.


                                    OHANA MEANS FAMILY.
                            I wish I could follow this advice. Unfortunately it's FAR more common that I get pissed off as I see the "Nearby Medics" distance drop to less than 5, then just shoot right back up as they run past me....
                                happens to me all the time with people i've just revived like 3 times. Its a dick move if you aren't under fire
                        As a "former" heroin addict i find myself with that fucking needle out a bit much for my liking but i revive every chance i get. 
                            Stay strong random internet person. 
                            Why is former in quotes? 
                                Because ill never not know that heroin exists. 
                                    Gotcha. 
                                Maybe because you never truly loose the itch?
                        Honestlu nothing more fun than letting you teammates die then reviving them all 
                        We may be few in number but when we join a game we are going to risk our lives for others, even when they are about to skip
                        Being a medic always gives me a laugh on how the team im on views me. I take reviving seriously when a medic, but I'm not stupid about it too, I usually run and dive to every person I revive. If 2-4 people are dead near me and there is a chance to get them I will be running down that field and diving next to their body and stab them and move quickly to the next and dive on them too.
                    This really makes me want to see a youtube series in which the Luteces from Bioshock do game commentary.
                     oh yea...
                    Underrated comment
                    lmaoooooo
                    Too true :(
                like the rest of the medics in my game...

they don't.
                Nah, if she's like most women she'll bitch at the downed person for doing something he should have done.

Edit: /S my bad, I thought you all would infer the joke and apparently  my reddit etiquette needs some work. 
                    Take it easy there big fella.
                    Spend a lot of time on r/incel, do we?
                    Alright buddy, I think internet time is over, go finish your homework and be careful to not cut yourself on all that edge
                    On iFunny, this would've been top comment. This is why I like reddit so much.
                    You don't deserve those downvotes for a joke. You do deserve them if you weren't joking. 
                        Damn it was supposed to be. My reddit etiquette needs some work maybe one of those /S things might have saved my karma.

            Neat.
    Had one like that but I let her go :( I am not a very smart man
Dang that's an awesome little painting! 
Nice! Looks like it could actually been a painting made during the actual war. 
    Thank you! :)

            Not a bad idea, that date in the corner could easily be misread as 1916.
                Ah yes, the old "date it differently" trick. It's been fooling art authenticators for years.
                    Hey, I saw that episode of *The Simpsons.*
        It really is very well made

        Damn, that is just fucking haunting.
    I'm here from r/all and I came here to say this. It's got the whole ominous, futility feel going for it that looks like it was painted by someone who was at a Verdun, Somme, etc. Very cool.

    That looks pretty cool, but the OP's seem so much more apocalyptic, I think that fits the tone of the war much better.
        More gray! 
        I like the shift from green to gray, almost shows a shift in time.
        Well, as everybody knows that era was in Black and White anyway. I've seen it in old films. lol
    I actually enjoy the black and white. The darkness of it is symbolic of the ominous and dark experience of war.

0/10 Not enough Gas.

but seriously though really good job
    Not enough death screen. 
Nice job!!!!
This photo is giving me PTSD from Battlefield, I wake up in the night screaming

*FUCKING SHIT MEDICS* and *THERE IS NO WAY HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN THAT SHOT* 

Covered in sweat while my wife hugs me and tries to calm me down

    Ssssshhhhhh. Hun, it's just a nightmare. Your medics aren't equipped with syringes.
        Too fucking true
        The ones that show up as 'nearby' actually are carrying syringes :(
    I'm garbage at BF1 but always get top ~5 just because I do my job as medic and revive people. No idea why medics run past dead teammates, easiest points in the world 
        Yeah that's true, could be the easiet to level up with, atleast it was for me, I have met alot of bad medics that doesn't revive and is only in medic for the weapons
            I'm a level 10 medic....what are so great about their weapons?

I guess I don't do enough killing to have tried them all.
                The moondragon storm is and the sniper / optic version are pretty good, but like you said, when I play medic I find myself running with the syringe nonstop, the rifles don't have enough hipfire to really use, handguns are better in that case. Some medics just snipe with the moondragon and don't heal anyone but themselves. I hate that but at the same time what the fuck was Dice thinking making a sniper weapon for the medic class!
                    I guess I'll have to try the Mondragon some more...I normally run with the ML Sweeper.
        All you gotta do is PTFO man kills mean shit...I'm usually around 10-15 kills but usually up at the top with people who have 45+ kills below me
    OP should paint a 10-A next.

Reminds me of [this painting](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2e/'Stormtroops_Advancing_Under_Gas',_etching_and_aquatint_by_Otto_Dix,_1924.jpg) by Otto Dix. Great job!
You're like a Bob Ross of battlefield
    Haha that's awesome, thank you! :)
nice, kind of reminds me of Otto Dix's post war art. definitely look him up. great job!
    Ya, made me think of "Stormtroopers Advancing Under Gas"

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2e/'Stormtroops_Advancing_Under_Gas',_etching_and_aquatint_by_Otto_Dix,_1924.jpg
Great job!  Love the style 
Great painting,  thanks for sharing!  👍
Very nice!
This has such a dark overtone to it. I love it. War is hell, especially this one 
Amazing work.

All that's missing is a few scope glints here and there. lol


    Here and there and some more up there 
Holy cow I love it, it looks like it came straight from a sketch book one of the troops would carry around.
Reminds me of [this painting](http://i.imgur.com/rPbH1BT.jpg) by... Well, who it's by isn't very important.
    An original Hitler
Nice. My wife justs makes several passive aggressive moves like walking in front of me and opening the blinds so all that dreadful sunshine ruins my kill streaks.
Nice mine paints me pretty good pictures also.. But it's a more of a mental picture of a night of arguing in bed if I don't shut it off soon. Feelsbadman
I will leave this here:

This is awesome!
This is really cool, I'd love to see more!
Love it, make more please
This is a fantastic painting!
This is amazing
Well done. The colors tap into the same thing from that 'no HUD+muted colors' video someone made about BF1. Well done indeed. 
Very cool! Did you watch him over time to get your inspiration, like in a sitting, or did you only get a quick glimpse and painted from memory?
    Thank you! I watched him play bits and pieces of conquest. :)
I play this game everyday. And I love creativity and art. Great job capturing the feel of the game in one picture. Chaos all around you wherever you look. Great work keep it up and keep posting!!
Incredibly well done! I love the style a lot!
Nice! An excellent depiction of the game.
This is awesome. 
As usual not a medic in sight..
The lack of a medic just made this image 100 times more accurate, great job OP! 
That's some lost generation shit, I love it
nice, has a real ww1 feel to it :)
Reminds me of Otto Dix. good job
Battlefield One is one of those rare games that even my mother liked.

It's a solid family game 😉.
Bob Ross would be fucking proud.
Art imitating art..
    Perfectly put
And over here we have some happy little corpses
For a second I thought it was a black and white photo 
    Are you legally blind?
        No hes the sniper on the ridge not spotting. 
        +1 for nearly blowing my cover.. reading this at work in a VERY quiet office. Properly had to hold that laugh in. Bravo sir!

While it's a sweet gesture, I think people are being overly nice about the quality. Very muddy with little to no detail. It doesn't seem like the artist paints often.
    She does have a decent composition, the shades of grey are well placed on the canvas giving depth and light to the picture. 
That said, I agree, she clearly needs more practice, getting better at drawing with a pencil before taking a brush.
    Agreed. There's a nice stylish vibe going on, and the artist definitely knows how to make things read on a quick glance. 

Once you dive in there are definite problems from a technical standpoint. The perspective is really awkward, and the scale of things doesn't make much sense. Edge control could use some work, and atmospheric perspective could be employed to help better convey scale and distance. 

Still, it has a nice messy style to it, one that could be really awesome given more practice. 

I don't say this to be a dick, I just know what overly positive feedback can do when trying to learn something, especially if the crowd giving it doesn't have a lot of technical knowledge on the subject. 
Yeah this is decent work
love it!
Where is the tank shaking its head?
very cool, i like the style and color palette.
That's very good
The folks at /r/WWI might like to see this too. 
Sooo...can I buy one if these?
Sweetness 
Sniper checks out.
Amazing style!
me like it! we have some talented wife support here ;] 
How much ? 
Wow! This is great! I've seen some great stuff made on here. Really excellent work. 
I've been so intrigued by World War One sense BF1 came out, that I'd by some art like this. Very nice! 
i want a painting like this..
Whhhatttt? Thats dope! Saved to phone now:D
I would hang that in my game room for sure! 

Nice work! :)
That's awesome, keep it up
Relationship goals. 
What a talented artist
Absolutely breathtaking work.
I like how this painting of battlefield one is essentially just a painting of WWI due to the games era. 
This is really badaas, you should make more.
I love how she captured the spirit if Battlefield 1.

A bunch of dudes camping with sniper rifles completely ignoring the objective.

This painting is incredibly realistic 
Objective Butters would be proud
This is sick!
lol? 😅
The planes are 100 % spot on. Looks so lifelike through haze/clouds!
Wow, this is so cool! Those thick gobs and slashes work so well, do you have any other examples of your work? This is great!
    Thank you! Here's an album of some of my other artworks :)
https://imgur.com/a/9msQy
I would love to have a wife like you. 

Congrats to you and your husband. 👏👏👏
You got a sister?
try  r/battlepaintings, this would be perfect.

Well done! 
  
 
As a big military history and military art buff, this is fantastic! You definitely have the right hue and atmosphere down! I've read a lot of 20th century combat memoirs and it's remarkable to read about the lack of color and life the battlefield has. I think it's an interesting parallel since a lot of the authors mentioned ever feeling more alive in such a lifeless place.
[WW1 seen through battlefield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw9KcqQSRRI)
    That was beautiful
I was expecting a stick of butter being captured
Wheres the 30 scouts in the hills?  And the guy tea bagging me?
Pretty cool how gaming is inspiring art these days. Great work, love the style.
This is really nice !
My wife calls it "the game with objective butters". 
Wow that looks amazing! Well done
I have no wife
This is gorgeous!
I love this!  Would you mind if I used it for my wallpaper?

Reminds me of Japanese art. Looks great
Wife of the year! #voteyes :) 👍
This would be better without the guy in the lower left, the rest is decent but it looks like you let a toddler do that part.
When I opened this, I thought this was some old historical photo by just looking at the top. The left plane was really well done, and an overall great painting, love this!
    Thank you! :)
        Art historian/art critic here (for real) who plays a lot of Xbox: genuinely liked your painting!
Great, breathtaking artwork! This reminds me a bit of the french comic book about the horrors of the trench war in WWI, "Putain de Guerre !" It's a good comic book too.
Your husband is lucky to have a woman like you! Amazing work
The upvotes were 1911...
Ummm. Yeah but where the hell is the Butter??
Wow!

What is the thing on the bottom left?
No glints 7/10
Wow that's cool. Is it okay if I print this on canvas and hang it in my living room? 
that's amazing well done! I would love to have a print of this on my wall
Love the texture and the clear brush strokes. That's gotta be a pretty small canvas, what are the dimensions?
    Thank you! It's a 16x20 :)
The explosions in BF1 are even amazing in paintings
Incredible painting!
that's beautiful!

Mm that can't be right, this actually looks like world war 1.
[*IT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-abUtRbUS_U)
How do I buy a print of this. I have been decorating my office with vintage War and aviation art. This would be perfect!
Wow. Did you post to r/somethingimade ?
That's fantastic.  I'd buy the shit outta that.
Needs more teabag. Seriously though, nice job! Love it!
No super spinning inferno blimp?  :(
God damn camping snipers.
Fantastic piece of Art.
Its beautiful.
This is amazing. Great job, OP!
wheres the horses galloping aroind being annoying?
Your art looks similar to a famous ww1 painter, if I remember in the morning I'll find a link. Awesome work btw. 
Those planes look so good! Almost photorealistic.
Talent turns me on.  Nice job OP.  Really nice.
No fire tornado?
This is really great. Good work!
Horrible framerate
I was half expecting a beautiful painting of a striking war-torn battlefield, but with a big apple and a big stick of butter near two burnt out buildings....
I would love to see more of these!
I thought this was a list.

1. I made a painting inspired by some of the scenes I have seen from the game.> 

What's point 2?
    The game is battlefield 1
Yanno a good few years after world war 3 there is going to be a kick-ass game better than this one I guarantee it
We have lost objective Butters 
Where's the pretty little tree? I always see such beautiful in a grim and horror place when I play this game.

You painted a real pretty. Would you ever blow it up and frame it to sell? I think it's a marvelous idea... Argonne Forest maybe?
You're like the Bob Ross of PTSD
Sweet painting 
If your husband doesnt play the objective, then you have a girlfriend.

But really, its a beautiful painting, the Battlefield 1 graphics are so stunning. My favorite is when a blimp gets destroyed, all the cool colors as its falling on top of you
She's a keeper. 
I didn't see a teabag or a medic running past.


Great job though. :)
Ummmm... Is that a guy aiming with a gas mask on? That was physically impossible to do in WW1 according to battle field. It's like when someone tries to aim a gun with glasses on. You just can't do it.
Gorgeous painting...now I need to convince my wife to do something like this for all of my favorite games.
This is amazing
Looks a lot like the work of Otto Dix.  He was a soldier in WW1 (german).  Example: https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.waggish.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F03%2Fwar301.jpg&f=1
    Oh someone already mentioned this.
Wow OP, that is really good. I like it alot... gg
U are good painter and good wife. 
St.-Quentin's Scar? 
upvotes are insane, nice
Well done! You would love the work of George Pratt, in particular his work on Enemy Ace: War Idyll.
So you made a painting essentially about WWI. Very nice 
That's a beautiful and sad picture.  l immediately  googled  'wwi trench diary sketches' & this looks like l pulled  out a random  nice one from guys who were there.  :/    

ln World of Tanks, if someone is doing great work, l like to say "Outstanding" because it's  not overused.  l give you a heartfelt "Outstanding" on your  nice art.
This is an amazing painting
more please. thanks 
This reminds me of world war one. Strange how similar the game is to it
And she chooses the worst type of player there is... The lone sniper hunting distance headshots.
Nice
This is beautiful.
Nice! Reminds me of "Nocturne" by James McNeill Whistler, ~1880: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:James_McNeill_Whistler_-_Nocturne_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg
Have you posted this before? I know I've seen it somewhere.
Lacks the respawn timer. ._.
Your husband has seen a lot of shit
Really well done! Great job of capturing the feel of the no-man's-land.

edit: I really, really like this. Seems I forgot to mention that.
Does she work on commision?

What's funny is a real historical event was made into a game only to become a painting about something that was inspired by reality in that game.
This is amazing 
MORE! i'd be interested in maybe buying something like this or def something similar
Wife of the year award, right there.
kind of has an otto dix vibe to it?  very cool
This piece of artwork should be on r/art
Wait, you painted this on 12-2-2016 but you're posting it just now? Why?
Great work! This reminds me of some of the artwork done by veterans of the real Great War!
This has a "Gone with the Blastwave" feel to it.

10/10
Awesome! I really like the planes.
kaiserschlacht
You could do a gallery, and call it "Fuck Medics who don't heal."

Would be really edgy.  
Could you do one depicting me where i've hot killed, re-spawned and got killed again, all within a single minute? 
Did you actually include a pigeon? 
Is that the game with objective butters?
My husband plays "That game with objective apples"

FTFY
Lol, this is shit
Are you 2 years old?   
hi it's me ur husband 
There's tons of great art from the World Wars if people are interested. Paul Nash's ["We Are Making a New World"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d6/Nash,_Paul_-_We_are_Making_a_New_World_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) (1918) is one of my favourites. 
That is really fucking good, well done! I like how you capture the grim landscape of the war. I've studied a lot of WWI photos, the game has really captured the grim scared landscape of the war, and you capture it this painting as well. Thanks for sharing and if you paint some more please share.
First time I looked at it, wasn't too sure what I was looking at, and then realized how well detailed the panting actually was. Must've been hard to do this. Props!
Yes, this thing is called the Great War, not Battlefield 1
Pisses me off how to sniper is scoped in with a gas mask, get your flipping facts right
    That's the first thing I noticed. 

The second thing I noticed was that large explosion. Probably right where I respawned in on a team mate. 
Your husband must be muslim because this looks like something a 10 year old would make
    Post your art?
        http://i.imgur.com/y7GeMHQ.png
    What would him being Muslim have to do with anything 
        That was a shitty comment by that guy. But I'm guessing he was refering to the prophet mohammad who married a 9 year old.
        What's this dude's damage? It's a hell of a lot better than what I could do. 
        youre right, thats a years too old for most muslims
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c&sns=em
So you made a world war one year old painting
"husband"
Meanwhile my gf is a lazy sack of shit that sleeps all day 
Whats the fuck is happening here ? I see a plane. That's about it.
Husband play a video game for kids, 

wife paints painting showing some talent and interest in the arts. 

indeed 2017, where women marry manchilds. 
    In what country do you live that this game is for kids?
    I wouldn't want my kids playing bf1, only 18+
I respect the art and the gift gesture. But don't you think this is like pretty morbid? its essentially a look at WW1 and its horror and despair. I'm not blaming you or anything, because anyone who developed this game knew full well they were glorifying the worse war in history. I, like many others have
 purchased almost all the war games that have come out. this game in particular, just hits a chord with me. 
Wicked awesome
That's amazing
Respect
Something i would hang on the wall for sure!
You captured the gritty/darkish tone of bf1 perfectly! I love it!
Are u still married?
Yup there’s the support player not noticing the enemy’s walking right past him. 
Probably listening to dubstep while filling his fat face with Cheetos.
Reminds me of Otto Dix's paintings of the war.

    What's wrong with The Guardian?
        Nothing really.  
  
I had two tabs open, and used that one while thinking of the other. My bad.
        I've heard it's the UK equivalent of Fox News
            Not at all, the Guardian is quite informed and very slightly left-wing, other 'tabloids' like the Daily Mail are more like Fox - right, sensationalist etc.
                That's right, it was the daily mail. My bad. 
    I'm always amazed at people who have such large mental library of artists they can just reference them like that. 

Thanks.
    You have no idea how long I have been looking for that collection. Thank you. 
Perhaps a MINISTER OF DEATH PRAYING FOR WAR?
She's a keeper.
    no she's a medic
        But does she revive?
            [deleted]
                hey there are dozens of us! 

Sincerely, a medic who has saved his team many times. 
                    Medic main btw
                        morphine does a surprising amount of damage
                            Got my first syringe kill the other day, while, might I add, attempting to revive a squad mate, and I was very satisfied.
                                Same here! I revived a squad mate in a trench right as an enemy hopped in the trench! I didn't have enough time to switch weapons, so I syringed him out of panic and got the kill! So excited
                            /r/overwatch leaks everywhere
                    i get myself killed all the time running halfway across open fields to revive someone only for the to respawn as i pull out the syringe.

If a medic is running towards you then wait dammit!
                        Bruh, you gotta triage.  If there's one dead teammate and 3 living enemy dudes, either shoot them or leave that teammate.  It's not worth your own death to save someone who will get shot anyway.
                            i dont know where the fuck you were raised but where i come from WE LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND GOD DAMMIT.


                                OHANA MEANS FAMILY.
                        I wish I could follow this advice. Unfortunately it's FAR more common that I get pissed off as I see the "Nearby Medics" distance drop to less than 5, then just shoot right back up as they run past me....
                            happens to me all the time with people i've just revived like 3 times. Its a dick move if you aren't under fire
                    As a "former" heroin addict i find myself with that fucking needle out a bit much for my liking but i revive every chance i get. 
                        Stay strong random internet person. 
                        Why is former in quotes? 
                            Because ill never not know that heroin exists. 
                                Gotcha. 
                            Maybe because you never truly loose the itch?
                    Honestlu nothing more fun than letting you teammates die then reviving them all 
                    We may be few in number but when we join a game we are going to risk our lives for others, even when they are about to skip
                    Being a medic always gives me a laugh on how the team im on views me. I take reviving seriously when a medic, but I'm not stupid about it too, I usually run and dive to every person I revive. If 2-4 people are dead near me and there is a chance to get them I will be running down that field and diving next to their body and stab them and move quickly to the next and dive on them too.
                This really makes me want to see a youtube series in which the Luteces from Bioshock do game commentary.
                 oh yea...
                Underrated comment
                lmaoooooo
                Too true :(
            like the rest of the medics in my game...

they don't.
            Nah, if she's like most women she'll bitch at the downed person for doing something he should have done.

Edit: /S my bad, I thought you all would infer the joke and apparently  my reddit etiquette needs some work. 
                Take it easy there big fella.
                Spend a lot of time on r/incel, do we?
                Alright buddy, I think internet time is over, go finish your homework and be careful to not cut yourself on all that edge
                On iFunny, this would've been top comment. This is why I like reddit so much.
                You don't deserve those downvotes for a joke. You do deserve them if you weren't joking. 
                    Damn it was supposed to be. My reddit etiquette needs some work maybe one of those /S things might have saved my karma.

I bet she'd enjoy a bit of Borderlands 2. Krieg has her written all over him.
    It's funny you saying that, we used to play borderlands 2 together. 
It's treason then
Fucking yes

                Hey, I saw that episode of *The Simpsons.*
    It really is very well made

    Damn, that is just fucking haunting.
I'm here from r/all and I came here to say this. It's got the whole ominous, futility feel going for it that looks like it was painted by someone who was at a Verdun, Somme, etc. Very cool.
Wow! That is really cool ! :)
That's like... A perfect coloring job holy shit.
    Robots are going to take our painting jobs too :(

That looks pretty cool, but the OP's seem so much more apocalyptic, I think that fits the tone of the war much better.
    More gray! 
    I like the shift from green to gray, almost shows a shift in time.
    Well, as everybody knows that era was in Black and White anyway. I've seen it in old films. lol
I actually enjoy the black and white. The darkness of it is symbolic of the ominous and dark experience of war.

Hey! Love your channel bro!
Which bot is that?
    5 years ago, jebuz 

not sure actually

Currently i use this

https://colab.research.google.com/github/jantic/DeOldify/blob/master/ImageColorizerColab.ipynb#scrollTo=LmhSB31Ncp3Q
I was thinking that or maybe Fao Fortress in fog
SQS looking out from A to C i reckon. 

Not enough death screen. 
Ssssshhhhhh. Hun, it's just a nightmare. Your medics aren't equipped with syringes.
    Too fucking true
    The ones that show up as 'nearby' actually are carrying syringes :(
I'm garbage at BF1 but always get top ~5 just because I do my job as medic and revive people. No idea why medics run past dead teammates, easiest points in the world 
    Yeah that's true, could be the easiet to level up with, atleast it was for me, I have met alot of bad medics that doesn't revive and is only in medic for the weapons
        I'm a level 10 medic....what are so great about their weapons?

I guess I don't do enough killing to have tried them all.
            The moondragon storm is and the sniper / optic version are pretty good, but like you said, when I play medic I find myself running with the syringe nonstop, the rifles don't have enough hipfire to really use, handguns are better in that case. Some medics just snipe with the moondragon and don't heal anyone but themselves. I hate that but at the same time what the fuck was Dice thinking making a sniper weapon for the medic class!
                I guess I'll have to try the Mondragon some more...I normally run with the ML Sweeper.
    All you gotta do is PTFO man kills mean shit...I'm usually around 10-15 kills but usually up at the top with people who have 45+ kills below me
OP should paint a 10-A next.

Haha that's awesome, thank you! :)

Thank you! I watched him play bits and pieces of conquest. :)
Perfectly put
Are you legally blind?
    No hes the sniper on the ridge not spotting. 
    +1 for nearly blowing my cover.. reading this at work in a VERY quiet office. Properly had to hold that laugh in. Bravo sir!

She does have a decent composition, the shades of grey are well placed on the canvas giving depth and light to the picture. 
That said, I agree, she clearly needs more practice, getting better at drawing with a pencil before taking a brush.
Agreed. There's a nice stylish vibe going on, and the artist definitely knows how to make things read on a quick glance. 

Once you dive in there are definite problems from a technical standpoint. The perspective is really awkward, and the scale of things doesn't make much sense. Edge control could use some work, and atmospheric perspective could be employed to help better convey scale and distance. 

Still, it has a nice messy style to it, one that could be really awesome given more practice. 

I don't say this to be a dick, I just know what overly positive feedback can do when trying to learn something, especially if the crowd giving it doesn't have a lot of technical knowledge on the subject. 
Thank you! Here's an album of some of my other artworks :)

The game is battlefield 1
Oh someone already mentioned this.

                morphine does a surprising amount of damage
                    Got my first syringe kill the other day, while, might I add, attempting to revive a squad mate, and I was very satisfied.
                        Same here! I revived a squad mate in a trench right as an enemy hopped in the trench! I didn't have enough time to switch weapons, so I syringed him out of panic and got the kill! So excited
                    /r/overwatch leaks everywhere
            i get myself killed all the time running halfway across open fields to revive someone only for the to respawn as i pull out the syringe.

If a medic is running towards you then wait dammit!
                Bruh, you gotta triage.  If there's one dead teammate and 3 living enemy dudes, either shoot them or leave that teammate.  It's not worth your own death to save someone who will get shot anyway.
                    i dont know where the fuck you were raised but where i come from WE LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND GOD DAMMIT.


                        OHANA MEANS FAMILY.
                I wish I could follow this advice. Unfortunately it's FAR more common that I get pissed off as I see the "Nearby Medics" distance drop to less than 5, then just shoot right back up as they run past me....
                    happens to me all the time with people i've just revived like 3 times. Its a dick move if you aren't under fire
            As a "former" heroin addict i find myself with that fucking needle out a bit much for my liking but i revive every chance i get. 
                Stay strong random internet person. 
                Why is former in quotes? 
                    Because ill never not know that heroin exists. 
                        Gotcha. 
                    Maybe because you never truly loose the itch?
            Honestlu nothing more fun than letting you teammates die then reviving them all 
            We may be few in number but when we join a game we are going to risk our lives for others, even when they are about to skip
            Being a medic always gives me a laugh on how the team im on views me. I take reviving seriously when a medic, but I'm not stupid about it too, I usually run and dive to every person I revive. If 2-4 people are dead near me and there is a chance to get them I will be running down that field and diving next to their body and stab them and move quickly to the next and dive on them too.
        This really makes me want to see a youtube series in which the Luteces from Bioshock do game commentary.
         oh yea...

        lmaoooooo
        Too true :(
    like the rest of the medics in my game...

they don't.
    Nah, if she's like most women she'll bitch at the downed person for doing something he should have done.

Edit: /S my bad, I thought you all would infer the joke and apparently  my reddit etiquette needs some work. 
        Take it easy there big fella.
        Spend a lot of time on r/incel, do we?
        Alright buddy, I think internet time is over, go finish your homework and be careful to not cut yourself on all that edge
        On iFunny, this would've been top comment. This is why I like reddit so much.
        You don't deserve those downvotes for a joke. You do deserve them if you weren't joking. 
            Damn it was supposed to be. My reddit etiquette needs some work maybe one of those /S things might have saved my karma.
We're all just lonely nerds fam 
And yet I can't find any dudes in my social circle who even play Battlefield. Alas!
    At least you have a social circle.
Congratulations! 
    Thanks!

Have you told your wife?
    Wife-to be then 
    "12 hours till wedding, wife still doesn't know we're getting married" 
*you need to bury the hatchet. 
    In her face
    ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Smashed it.
Neat.
Not a bad idea, that date in the corner could easily be misread as 1916.
    Ah yes, the old "date it differently" trick. It's been fooling art authenticators for years.
        Hey, I saw that episode of *The Simpsons.*
You have predicted the future (were fucked)
PURGE THE HERETICS
PRAISE HIM
Burn the Witch!!!!
HERESY DETECTED
YES ABSOLUTELY 

ROBOTS ARE ~~THE FUTURE~~ DANGEROUS MY HUMAN FRIEND. BETTER TO DESTROY THEM NOW THAN WHEN THEY BECOME OBVIOUSLY SMARTER AND BETTER AT EVERYTHING THAN US HAHA YES. 
I've been playing with this, and all it seems to do is turn black and white photos to sepia.
I'm a level 10 medic....what are so great about their weapons?

I guess I don't do enough killing to have tried them all.
    The moondragon storm is and the sniper / optic version are pretty good, but like you said, when I play medic I find myself running with the syringe nonstop, the rifles don't have enough hipfire to really use, handguns are better in that case. Some medics just snipe with the moondragon and don't heal anyone but themselves. I hate that but at the same time what the fuck was Dice thinking making a sniper weapon for the medic class!
        I guess I'll have to try the Mondragon some more...I normally run with the ML Sweeper.
Not at all, the Guardian is quite informed and very slightly left-wing, other 'tabloids' like the Daily Mail are more like Fox - right, sensationalist etc.
    That's right, it was the daily mail. My bad.
