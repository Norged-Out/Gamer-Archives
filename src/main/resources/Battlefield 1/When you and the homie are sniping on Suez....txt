    Nailed it !
    Ugh!! I played a match on St Quentin Scar last night where my team had 28 players. 15 of them were f-n scouts!! I left after it was apparent we were going to lose huge. It was 550-200 when I left.
        Right? There's more than just long distance sniping. It's not hard to rack up a load of kills with the SMLE Carbine while moving up with your team.

Having 20 long range snipers is just stupid, and you're all competing for the same kills.
        I think I may have been in that game. That or I played another team who did the same thing. Big win either way. 
            It was last night around 11-11:30ish Eastern.
                I was on at about 10 or 10:30 central, so it very well may have been the same round. My condolences for your team being dumb. 
                    Ugh! It sucked so I did what I normally do in these situations. I become the squad leader then boot all those lazy scouts out of the squad, then leave.
I know it isn't much but at least I give them some annoyance when they realize they are not in a squad anymore.
                        I like that. 
                            My long term hope is that them getting booted from a squad will make them reevaluate their life decisions.
                                Godspeed to you in achieving that goal, friend. 
                        I didn't know you could boot squad members. How?
                            Only if you are squad leader. Go to the squad screen, go to your squad and hit the button for " Manage Squad". Highlight player you want to boot, then hit the button for it. Then rinse and repeat for any other members you want to boot.

P.S. Make sure you hit the right buttons, or you can accidentally kick yourself out of the squad by leaving it.
        Probably the game I was in. I seen someone bitching about it in the chat, was that you cussing the team and said you were leaving?
Good Scouts can do a lot of work. I swap to Scout often to take out certain targets. Example, I was playing Ballroom Blitz, we only had A and B objectives and could never get to the building to try and take C. The building was loaded on the overhead walkways per usual. I spawned in with a m1903 and cleared the whole roof off then went around to get D. We ended up turning it around and winning. I'm not taking credit for the victory but Scouts are necessary and it gets old listening to everyone bitch.
            No I wasn't in game chat

    Heh, in hardline there's a gamemode where you need to drive cars around for points (conquest but the cars are the CP's)... there would always be guys in the mountains trying to snipe you out of your car. Me & my buddies used to refer to them as tusken raiders, taking potshots at passing podracers :D
        And RussianBadger also made a video on it.
            Ooh, i'm gonna have to see that now! :D

Operation Cute Storm
    featuring elite stormpooper
    There's nothing cute about these camping degenerates 
Fun fact these are called Sand cats and they are vicious carnivores. 

Per Wiki: 

Sand cats live solitary lives outside of the mating season. They communicate using scent and claw marks on objects in their range and by urine spraying. They do not leave their feces in exposed locations as many other felids do. They make vocalizations similar to domestic cats but also make loud, high-pitched barking sounds, especially when seeking a mate.[19] Hearing plays an important role in intraspecific communication; sand cats make a short, rasping bark in connection with mating activity.[13]

They inhabit burrows and use either abandoned fox or porcupine burrows or enlarge those dug by gerbils or other rodents. The burrow is about 1.5 m (4.9 ft) deep and dug in slightly slanting ground with usually only a single entrance, though burrows with two or three entrances have also been observed. In winter, they stay in the sun during the day, but during the hot season, they are crepuscular and nocturnal.[6]

Their way of moving is distinct: with belly to the ground, they move at a fast run punctuated with occasional leaps. They are capable of sudden bursts of speed and can sprint at speeds of 30 to 40 km (19 to 25 mi) per hour.[26] During a radio telemetry study in Israel, sand cats were found to have large home ranges, with one male using an area of 16 km2 (6.2 sq mi). They have been recorded to move long distances of 5â€“10 km (3.1â€“6.2 mi) in a single night and were generally active throughout the night, hunting and travelling an average of 5.4 km (3.4 mi). Before retiring below ground at dawn, the observed cats adopted the same lookout position at the mouth of the burrow. Different cats used burrows interchangeably and did not change burrows during the day.[22]

Small rodents are their primary prey, with records from Africa including spiny mice, jirds, gerbils, jerboas, and young of cape hare. They have also been observed to hunt small birds like greater hoopoe lark, desert lark, and consume reptiles such as small desert monitors, fringe-toed lizards, sandfish, short-fingered gecko, horned and sand vipers, and insects. They are capable of satisfying their moisture requirements from their prey but drink readily if water is available.[2] They can dig rapidly to extract their prey from the ground and bury prey remains in the sand for later consumption
    I thought sand cats had the little black stripes on their legs?
Those are cats not tumors

Cat.

In the deserts of Australia cats have integrated themselves into the ecosystem, so much so that aboriginals now hunt them for meat
does this mean orange cats are sandcats
They look like cream soda 
Ha.... Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha this was actually a good one.
Are you really at the actual Suez Canal or just a place that looks like it?
Is this in the UAE

See that camping Arty truck over meow, let's take that pussy out. [get blown up by truck after traversing half the map trying to take it out]
Cat in the foreground looks exactly like mine.
You forgot the spotlight attached to their head so players can see them whenever they use the scope.
Yes!!! Prone Pussy!!! Haha this is so awesome, it's the nickname I use for no good dick in the dirt campers.  The "P" in prone is for Pussy! We're already sitting on our asses playing a video game in reality might as well go out like rambo in the virtual world.  Remember snipers, you'll get a yeast infection if you rub your pussy in the sand too long, and their won't be a medic around to give you vagisil back behind the spawn. Pussy rant over.

It was last night around 11-11:30ish Eastern.
    I was on at about 10 or 10:30 central, so it very well may have been the same round. My condolences for your team being dumb. 
        Ugh! It sucked so I did what I normally do in these situations. I become the squad leader then boot all those lazy scouts out of the squad, then leave.
I know it isn't much but at least I give them some annoyance when they realize they are not in a squad anymore.
            I like that. 
                My long term hope is that them getting booted from a squad will make them reevaluate their life decisions.
                    Godspeed to you in achieving that goal, friend. 
            I didn't know you could boot squad members. How?
                Only if you are squad leader. Go to the squad screen, go to your squad and hit the button for " Manage Squad". Highlight player you want to boot, then hit the button for it. Then rinse and repeat for any other members you want to boot.

P.S. Make sure you hit the right buttons, or you can accidentally kick yourself out of the squad by leaving it.
No I wasn't in game chat
