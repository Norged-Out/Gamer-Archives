            It's weird I see a huge overlap between racists and video games. I never see this in sports or even sport games.  It's interesting bc it used to be jocks who were assholes but nowadays they're all the dickheads are nerds.
                That's because you're essentially anonymous when playing video games. 
                i mean most of the racism is to be an "edgy memester"
                People will say anything when their face is hidden behind a computer screen.
                    anything
                 Because people who play video games are gross
                Jocks play video games
            Red Orchestra is full of them, specifically if you play on the German side
                Yeah. The White Supremacists never play as the Soviets, and I'm sure everyone can guess why.
            I don't know, I feel like I would be hard-pressed to find an opponent on chess.com who's fucked my mom
        Oh thank god I thought I was the only one, I remember an Amiens game becoming a lot more intense when a bunch of seemingly okay players suddenly started talking about how race mixing is destroying Europe and how we need to "keep our blood pure by deporting all non-whites"

Yeah there are a lot of racists playing battlefield for some reason 
            It's extra surreal when you're on a European server and you get actual irl Germans from 2017, on the virtual German team from 1917, raving about Jewish socialism raping German culture and destroying the continent. 
                Now this was something I did not expect to read
            I think 99% of those people are just kidding around. I'm an extremely mild mannered person "in real life." But when I'm on battlefield 1 I don't know what happens to me. Something takes over and I have to teabag absolutely everyone and remind everyone that their mothers all blew me last night.  

It's cathartic. 
                I dunno man, they've all seemed pretty serious so far, there's a difference between excessive jokes and genuinely expressing an argument to deport everyone who isn't white 

Also I don't really buy the kidding around thing, still seems super immature and makes the game feel kinda toxic, if you get catharsis from acting like an 8 year old then there's something wrong with you 
                You're my spirit animal mane 
            I was on, ballroom (can’t remember if that’s the name) and watched two people going at it over one of them having some offensive emblem towards Jewish people, entire chat descended into a lot of Jewish and ww2 jokes…

        White is a nation now?
            [White Nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism). Of course 'white' is not a nation, but it's not even a race. None of their views are based in reality.

Also don't shoot people parachuting from downed planes and blimps. 
    Woops. 
    [deleted]
        Well those are just happy accidents
    It's ok I never hit any of them anyway
        lol i know that feeling
    Is there a reason for that or just a matter of respect in militaries?
        It's because when parachuting, you are considered to be a non threat and defenseless because you have no avenue of escaping enemy fire. So you are essentially at that point a non-combatant until you reach the ground, which makes shooting at you a war crime. HOWEVER, this only applies to ejecting pilots. The law of war does not prohibit firing upon paratroops or other persons who are or appear to be bound upon hostile missions while such persons are descending by parachute. Persons other than those mentioned in the preceding sentence who are descending by parachute from disabled aircraft may not be fired upon.
            But people bailing on bf1 have a weapon with them.
                All pilots have a standard issue sidearm for defense if they need to eject. It can also be used to hunt for food while waiting for rescue from remote areas. 
                    I wouldn't really consider a double barreled shotgun a standard issue sidearm.
                        It's also a video game. I'm talking more about in real life. 
                            Yea I get too into these discussions.
                        6 years but whatever

In real life, double barreled shotguns were used for SIS pilots due to the fact they could be used for hunting. Most had slugs and birdshot. This includes during ww1

Another cool fact is that in WW2, there was a German double barrel which also had a rifle attached that pilots used. The rifle commonly used soft point rounds which were illegal to shoot people with, but were fine against animals.
                            That actually makes alot of sense, you learn something new everyday haha.
                                The More You Moe
              I feel like it is about pilots being valuable POWs. I don't know how to say it outside of chivallary. Personally I would say shoot them, because it is war. Especially if they just bombed a position. Pilots are expensive to train and use.

 You cannot hold back in a total war scenario. What if they get back to friendlies and fly again just to kill more of your side.

 I would hate myself for sure, but you have a gun and an expensive asset which is dangerous. If I had the skill to just shoot the parachute just enough to make them break their legs I would.
                I appreciate this response.
                     Thanks. I would feel guilty if I ever did it especially prioritizing life as an asset, but pretty sure I would be enraged in full war if I saw the destruction on my friends or such by pilots while being a grunt or such, and wouldn't give two fucks.

 Pilots who hit the ground still are a danger. Do they not carry pistols?

 I don't know honestly. War sucks, period. Even these videos of Ukraine is just like hell, how many soldiers just died.

 Pilots shouldn't be immune to that. No difference in pushing a button as an asset or a grunt pulling a trigger. Short of cost. Feels bad man typing this.

            The thing is though America was not involved until the interception of the Zimmerman telegram and after a ton of US ships were sunk but gas was still being used before they joined
                The Germans initially used the gas, and the way they did it was by burying the cylinders into the ground and taking the lids off when the wind was to their backs. Their thought was that by doing it that way it wasn't a violation of The Hague convention. After a few grizzly uses of this, the brits and French said fuck it, and put it in their artillery rounds because fuck you, the Germans opened Pandora's box by using it first. 

Source - dan carlin's hardcore history
            > don't sink boats we like

We didn't really care about the Lusitania, only 128 Americans died. You're statement still stands though, since the U.S.S. Maine started the Span-Am war.
                Newspapers started the Spanish-American War. 
                    Hearst started the Spanish-American war*
                        Hearst and Pulitzer
            It was a *British* Vessel, Germany *did* say they were going to sink in months in advance, Germany *also* said it was because passenger vessels were carrying arms for Britain and uh... yeah it all turned out to be true.
                It had over 100 Americans on it and already a few Americans had died on other ships sank by the Germans. Still, fuck Britain for carrying arms on a passenger ship. It's like using a human shield.
            I know you said among others.. but i like how you mentioned US but not Russia, as if it wasn't a way bigger player in the war...
            George carlin once said "If you have brown people, we will bomb you!"
            the hero we needed in 1916
            Well it was still a war between signatory powers, even if the US wasn't one. Them not adopting it doesn't mean they aren't bound by it.
            If you don't want your passenger boats sunk, don't fill them with munitions. 
            Gas was used long before the US entered the war in April 1917.  The Battle of Ypres saw the first use of poison gas l, by Germany, in 1915.  

If anything the Hague Conferences were an effort by the ruling European parties to try and slow down the massive arms race that exploded at the turn of the century.  To the monarchs, especially Tsar Nicholas of Russia, the massive stockpiling and development of new arms posed a direct threat to their power in the long run.  This was especially true with Russia, who was farther behind in industrialization than its Western European counterparts.

Therefore, it could be argued that the agreements at the Hague Conferences were more of an attempt to "slow down" the arms race rather than stop it completely.  That would explain why many of the propositions at the Hague Conference either had a short expiration date or why some of the other more developed powers decided not to sign them.
                Interesting points, but you're like 3 months late haha

        So fun fact, Japan had not ratified the Geneva conventions during WW2, so the prosecution of Japanese war crimes was incredibly difficult 
            That doesn't sound very fun!
                I guess you had to be there.
    >Projectiles 

thats why germans used gas cylinders
        came here to say this. They "released" the gas
            I'm imagining them opening up cans with one hand pinching their nose like it's that Tupperware you left in the refrigerator for far too long.
                Pretty much, only relying on wind direction not to blow it back in your face and gas masks with very limited effectiveness instead of pinching their nose.
                    Yeah I remembered they time they did that and the wind changed and they killed their own first wave of troops. 
                        I believe that was the first British use.  When the Germans first used chlorine gas (they had already attempted to use "tear gas" on the russians)  they devastated the French colonial troops impacted. It's believed that if they had actually pushed the gap instead of using it as a test they could have opened up the lines. 
                            The French were the first to use gas, but it was tear gas. Germany used lethal gas first. 
                What do you think they're barbarians? Of course they used clothespins instead of their fingers; they had the technology.
                There were instances where the gas they released did blow back into their own lines.
                Probably in the beginning it was similar to that haha! They had to time it with the wind direction (which was typically blowing towards the German lines).
                    Why didn't they shoot it then behind enemy lines
                        From the Hague Convention of 1899

>This declaration states that, in any war between signatory powers, the parties will abstain from using **projectiles** "the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases." Ratified by all major powers, except the United States.
                PROTIP: Baked beans work great as a mold starter. 
                Put it in the freezer, then take it out for a bit and open it inside a bin bag
        Ding ding ding. We have a winner. It was a loophole but I think they eventually used gas projectiles towards the end of the war when they were losing.
            Both sides did, IIRC the British were the first to use them 
                The Germans were the first to use gas. They attempted it against the Russians early in the war, but it was too cold. Later they caused a massive gas cloud at Ypres that was the first successful gassing of the war.
                    Operation Disinfection
                    Sorry, I thought we were referring to the first to use real projectiles 
                        Depends on your definition of projectiles, but in both instances I believe they were fired as artillery shells that released gas on impact.
                            At Bolimów I think so, not at Ypres though. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres):
>German troops carried 5,730 gas cylinders, weighing 90 pounds (41 kg) each, to the front by hand. The cylinders, opened by hand, relied on the prevailing wind to carry the gas towards enemy lines. Because of this method of dispersal, a large number of German soldiers were injured or killed while carrying out the attack.
                                Not at the Battle of Ypres, but near Ypres at Langemark according to Wikipedia. Also that's weird, the Wikipedia article and book I'm reading said that Bolimow was an artillery shelling that was ineffective because the it was so cold that the gas froze.
                    Not the last time the Germans succeeded in using gas.
            Also, couldn't they have argued there was a purpose for like shrapnel or something? Making it no longer the sole purpose?
        How were they delivered if not being projectiles?
            wind and hope it goes towards enemy
            They were. At Ypres, the first successful gassing, they were fired from artillery. The canisters hit the ground and excreted the gas, which is heavier than air so it sank into the trenches.
        But only related to chlorine gas.  Mustard gas was deployed via shell.  Negating their claim that they were still within the bounds of the Hague convention.
  
"Fatally injured victims sometimes took four or five weeks to die of mustard gas exposure."  Damn...
    Actually The Hague convention said gas shells could not be used so the Germans found a technical loophole. When gas was first used the Germans simply opened containers of chlorine gas when the wind was at their backs. *Technically*, it didn't violate the conventions rules as they weren't projectiles.
        so they essentially shit in the wind and let mother nature do the killing?
            Yep. First people to encounter it were Algerian and Canadian troops. Didn't even move, they didn't know what it was. Terrible way to die.

                            I suggest watching "Storming Juno", it covers the Canadian landings. Severely underappreciated movie.
                                Thanks, I'll give that a view

                            Or how Canadian troops had the right to liberate Rome. Mark Clark disobeyed orders to flank the city and cut off the German retreat, instead he marched American troops through the city. 
                        Also gonna add that we were in both world wars before the United States since we still had strong ties to Britain
                        back in early 2000's afghabistan photos were leaked showing Canadian special forces dragging prisoners of war into base after a series of highly successful raids. the Canadian DOD (or whatever it's called) was able to cover up their involvement for years by saying they were American troops. 
                        Check out the battle of Beaumont Hamel and the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. An entire colonies army wiped out in less than 10 minutes.
                        Visited Amiens this summer, right before the centennial for the battle of the Somme, and the Canadians had a very nice memorial/ museum, and it's one of the only places where you can walk through original trenches. I think it was the spot where the Newfoundland regiment earned their"Royal" status as they fought like crazy and lost an enormous amount of their forces.
                        My great grandfather was a canadian soldier in WW1. Took an MG burst to the arm and lost the whole thing.

That man was amazing.

Always used to say the best day of his life was the day they came out with Velcro laced shoes...
                    Yes I am aware of all this, though you must keep in mind the Canadians would have been completely routed had the German high command known how effective the gas attacks would've been. It was supposed to be just a test to see how the gas would work, no one was expecting for it to decimate enemy lines. That's not to take away from the incredible bravery and courage of the Canadians, but the German failure can be really pinned on the high command for not planning for a full attack after the gas attacks, or at least saving the gas for a true offensive. 
                    Surely the guy had to have had some formal education in sciences? How else does one "realize" that pissing on a cloth and breathing through it lets you survive the gas?

Then the explanation was added later.
                        They have these short clips they play on CBC showing epic historical moments in Canadian history and there was one about this. I think he was a chemistry teacher or something. 
        I learned this from Hardcore History!
        Still a dick move, but something tells me  they  weren't too worried about that.
    As mentioned below this outlawed projectiles which is why the initial use of gas in WWI was by just opening containers and letting it drift with the wind. I think it is more interesting that the escalation from there shows how "laws of war" work in general. 

When you think about it you probably wonder who enforces the laws of war: There is no policeman of war, certainly Ares will not come down and punish the guilty.

What happens is kind of a multi step process.

1. First it is a gentleman's agreement between nations. Country A and B basically have a discussion some time before the war and say "If we go to war you don't do X, and we won't either. Then we can have a good clean war!"

2. Country A breaks rule X, probably just a little. Now what? Well Country B has already stopped trading with them, so sanctions are not going to be an added punishment. The only thing B can do is to take reprisals by engaging in the same banned activity or a different (hopefully proportional) banned activity.

3. Now Country A is not happy. Sure they may have broken rule X, but they feel like Country B is breaking the rules worse than they did. Country A expands their banned practices a bit. Bit by bit the war, which was probably hell anyway, gets worse and worse for the countries involved. 20 years later these two countries are used as an example of why you don't engage in military practices that everyone agreed not to do.
        >When you think about it you probably wonder who enforces the laws of war: There is no policeman of war

The winner is judge, jury, and persecutor (sic). The policemen are the soldiers and whoever has the biggest and best police force get to uphold their laws.
            Yeah that's why you don't start fights you can't finish...*Japan*. 
        Country A is a dick for breaking the rules first, I totally understand country B though, just trying to stay alive
        WWII expresses the "gentlemen's agreement" very well if you look at The Nazis' attitude towards the different fronts. WWI does as well but not to the extremes of the second.
        Well Ares certainly won't. I didn't kill him in God of War for nothing
    The Germans tried to get around it initially by opening up well positioned cans full of gas when the wind condition was right. They claimed that they weren't using the asphyxiant as a projectile with that method.
    Mustard gas is also okay because it's asphyxiating **and** deleterious.
    Hey! That says "using projectiles". There isn't anything wrong with just opening canisters of gas when it is windy, right?
    Also, another fun fact: France was the first country to use a gas (tear gas iirc) in WWI. Germany just went above and beyond in retaliation. 
        Tear gas sounds much more humane compared to deadly chlorine though. I doubt soldiers died due to any tear gas. Police uses it extensively during most protests/rallies nowadays. 
    Yep, Gas WAS Illegal, the second Hague Convention further extended the list of banned weapons of war against signatory powers. Once one side broke the  treaty however (Germany in Ypres), all bets were off. The Allies ended up using more gas than the Central Powers if I recall correctly.
    Yup, the Germans way around that was to launch artillery shells with a special casing around it to where it would technically not be against the hague convention.
    If I am not mistaken, they loopholed this by having gas canisters planted in the field and then releasing the gas with the wind.
    Good Ol Russians making this happen
    [deleted]
        I assume you'd just remember Hague convention, that what you're talking about or trying to remember has to do with gas warfare, Google it and voila. Much like many other things we remember snippets of it and through research, be it going to the library or referencing a book of yore or Googling it, you find the exact place it is in and cite it.

This is also the reason why those with great memory and read/watch things a lot tend to be able to write research work pretty quickly and accurately. I know it took a tenth of the time for me to write anything versus that of the average of my university mates.
    You're correct, but the German's went around this by opening gas containers down wind from the enemy. Causing it to drift to their lines. Thus making it not being used in a projectile form.
    Didn't Germany use chlorine gas all the time in WW1 though?
    The use of poison gas performed by all major belligerents throughout World War I constituted war crimes as its use violated the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited the use of "poison or poisoned weapons" in warfare.
  
So pretty much every nation involved in WWI committed war crimes according to the Hague conventions.
    I've got to say. I went through about eightish minutes worth of this thread before I remembered I'm in the Battlefield 1 subreddit and not some r/history thread.
    Projectiles... so you're saying I can still run around with a large gas canister as a backpack and try to trailgaser people?
    Was gonna say this.
    Yet the US didn't use gas themselves. They made some for other Entente countries though. 
    This doesn't even get into the fact that the way gas was initially used was as a released cloud to skirt these exact conventions. The specific mention of projectiles was meant to stop the use of gas in artillery shells, so what the hell who cares about releasing a giant cloud of gas and having it roll down wind, right?
    You can also use gas against your own civilians.

Who cares about the peasants.

You silly goose
    Hitler did nothing wrong


        He's just a kid, leave him alone!
            He fought in WWI, little older than a kid. 

People would joke years later about how they had the opportunity to shoot Hitler in WWI but didn't. If they only knew. 

I forget exactly who it was Hitler met with, but they shared war stories and found out they were at the same place,  at the same time on opposing fronts. They were in trenches 70 yards across from each other. That's when they would joke with the person and say how he had the chance to shoot him, haha. 
                Wasn't he like a message runner though? 
                    He had an iron cross first class which were not given out lightly
                        Say what you want about Hitler but he was a fanatical soilder. He put his life on the line multiple times and I think at one point took 5 French soldiers prisoners by him self. He was a very good ground solider. Luckily I suppose that doesn't translate into a good person.... I would say leader but he was arguably a good leader.... just sucked at the human rights shit and military problems.
                            Most of his stories are proven fabricated. The capture of the French soldiers being the most notable. 
                                Oh shit.... Is that true? 

Now I need to go read up on that.... If that is the case then my bad. Its really hard to tell with Hitler because so many things have been slandered because of what he did
                                    Yeah I agree. There's never been a slander campaign like the one after WWII. History will be written by the victors.
                            Maybe fighting in the war fucked his head up 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
                                After listening to the absolute horrors of that war I'm inclined to agree. And there can be no doubt that the terms the French and English forced on the Germans paved the way to Hitler taking power.
                            He wasn't even that bad with the military problems as a leader. He was heavily involved with the planning and execution of the invasions of Poland and France, and some of his suggestions for those plans turned out to be highly successful. His failures as a military leader can pretty much all be chalked up to British intelligence being really good at its job or Hitler's inner circle being filled with sycophants giving him inaccurate reports. 
                        Most of Hitler's great militaristic achievements never occurred, they were mainly made up by the Nazi regime during their reign. It was done to glorify Hitler and portray him as this strong militia who fought heroicly against the enemies
                            As far as I know no one has been able to convincingly discount the military honours he very clearly had since before anyone thought anything of him politically
                    "You know what we usually say? Well just shoot _that_ one."
                    Being a message runner could mean running through some pretty dangerous conditions under bombardment and gas attack and etc. though. It wasn't like he got a safe job. I mean he was injured and hospitalized twice in the war, once when a shell hit his dugout, and another from a gas attack.
                    You say that as if it was some lowly position.   Runners had stones and that was recognized.  
                On October 14, 1918, Hitler himself got wounded by gas.
                    Its why he never resorted to using it against enemy combatants. 
                        Yup! Just some Jews, but who cares about them right guys!
                Yeah but then maybe Rommel or Goebbels would have risen to power, and they weren't as insane and stupid as Hitler was, they might have actually made the war last longer

        idk, i heard he made some terrible art
            It was decent
        [Did you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRPEsRp3utc) that the Germans were not prone to using gas weapons in WWII because of Hitlers experience and injuries suffered from them during WWI while he served in the German military.
            I think it could be argued that gas weapons of the time would not have been nearly as useful in WW2. They were a hassle to use even in WW1 with static positions on both sides. Considering the nature of WW2, if people thought that gas was a war-winner, you can be sure they'd use it.
        Here you dropped this: /s

Edit: well, when I commented he had a score of -3, so I was just trying to help
            Oh thanks, I really thought he is dead serious haha

        Dang, that's a good joke. I didn't get it before the edit.
        Even if one thought that Hitler did nothing *morally* wrong, I think everybody can agree that he did things wrong *strategically*
        Didn't Hitler still fight for the Germans in WW1 though?
            Nobody was right in WW1, people fought for their homelands.  Even Anne Franks' father was a soldier for the German army.
                WW1 is not the black and what good vs evil war that WW2 was.

                                So the US didnt invade Iraq to stop ISIS after 9/11??
    It kinda surprises me that Hitler never used gas in combat considering how frivolous he was with it elsewhere. 
        He experienced it and was afraid it would be used against his own troops, IIRC. Obviously the Jews were a different subject for him.
        With the amount of civilian bombing in WW2 on both sides, adding gas would of been terrifying.

You could of fixed that
I really wish BF1 had proximity chat so that I could yell german sounding gibberish at people as I am gassing them.
    Just team chat in general would be nice. There are so few people on consuls mic'd up that having it so you can only talk to your squad is pretty much pointless. 
        But typing on console is ridiculous and by the time you could type a sentence you'd be dead.
            They could make better/customizable presets for chat, like in rocket league. Wow!
                Yeah. I play a lot of overwatch and I wish for that too. The presets they have are useful but sometimes you just need to be able to say "go healer" "why are you two the same hero?!?!" "Why is our team all stack  heroes we're defending!"
                    Hanzo is totally a healer, he just prevents the damage from happening in the first place.

                    Right number in bf1
                They should at least add a quick button for "Thanks" on pc. 

so many times when I see a medic coming all the way from 20 meters to revive me and it's just a hustle to use that chat wheel to say Thanks  in the middle of combat. I can't count the times I died while trying to wheel chat to say thanks and get killed again :/

Overwatch has a single button for saying Thanks iirc, 1 click and it says thanks. 
                We have Go Go Go, but I need Go left, Go right, stop.
                Or release a chatpad for the controller like the 360. 
                Apex has a very simple and effective communication system also. Don't know why there are some things all games just dont adopt.
            I don't disagree with that. What i'm getting at is more that it would be helpful to be able to voice chat with the whole team and not just your squad. 
                Oh yeah. I misunderstood your comment.
            No you just face the wall and no one attacks you. It's law 
            We're talking about BF1, you're dead anyway. 
        And the ones that do are playing shitty rap music in the mic
        I had to turn VOIP off on console. Too much distracting chatter and random noises. Probably the environment the Console player is in. Whereas with PC at least they're predominantly in an isolated area of the house (apologies for the generalisation). 
            That makes sense. Consoles are generally in a living room where the family gathers, where as a lot of people will have a dedicated computer room or area. 
        Also now with party chat via psn even if a couple people are mic'd up they are probably chatting in party chat. On ps3 I made a lot of gaming friends by just getting into a game where a couple of them were already friends and chatting. Usually people were stoked to find someone else with a mic on. Now (at least in my experience) we all talk in a party outside the game.
    I was playing the for honor beta and teamed up with a German dude. His English was pretty good but has a heavy accent. He lost a long duel when someone else came up and tossed him off the edge. He lost it and went off on the most glorious tirade I've ever heard playing game video games and I didn't understand a word of it.
        Had a similar experience in BF1 but with my Finnish friend. His rant inspired me to start learning that beautiful language lol.
            [This will get you far](http://i.imgur.com/2vhgoGN.png) 
                Wait that phrase means all those things?
                    Ofcourse! It would be a shame to waste such a good phrase, so instead of using it once, we can use it multiple times! But don't worry, [finnish language is very well organized](http://i.imgur.com/0bMxF0R.jpg) 
        I play BF with a German dude that I found in a match, now he's an important member of our squad.  Sadly he stays calm and collected most of the time so I don't get to hear any glorious tirades such as you experienced.

But seriously, nobody says Schweinehund, just use Arschloch instead ;)
They did agree you couldn't use gas mortar shells but they never said you couldn't take a cap off a gas cannister and let the wind carry it towards the enemy. 

Some of the tales I've read about WWI gas attacks are insane. 
    Care to share?
        Check out Dan Carlin's hardcore history about WWI. Fucking. Insane.
            also https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGreatWar
            And actually, *any* of the references Carlin frequently cites, particularly Peter Hart and his books about the BEF and Passchendaele are amazing. Even general [Erich von Falkenhayn](https://archive.org/details/germangeneralsta00falk) himself has some unique insight.
        At the 2nd Battle of Ypres the Germans just let loose a ton of gas downwind at the French troops and completely pushed them out. The Germans didn't expect it to succeed so well and didn't have a push planned, so no real territory changed hands. After Ypres troops were better prepared for gas attacks as seen by Canadian troops taking high ground and holding their ground in future attacks.

Look at Art. 23. Ratified before WWI.
    Yeah, it's not like the idea of rules of war were suddenly thought up after WWI. 
        No, of course, but it is known that the German Kaiser Wilhelm was a firm criticizer of the rules of war. He is famous for saying that the concordats and declarations were just "pieces of paper". You could expect that from a man whose first act of war was attacking a neutral country
            The initial goal wasn't so much to attack Belgium so much as march through it on their way to France, but the Belgians had other plans and delayed the Germans long enough for the Brits and French to prepare themselves and send help

                    Dan Carlin taught me that.
                        I didn't even see your comment, and Dan Carlin popped into my head (Quote: yadda-yadda-yadda.  End Quote.)

Man, if Dan Carlin was a History Teacher or professor, his classes would be full.
                        He taught me that....agin and agin and agin and agin.

I'lll never hear the word again the same, I'll always think of the way he says it.
                        Keith Heading told me that joke!
                    Firstly, internally the Holocaust was considered self defense by the Nazis. That doesn't make it any better in the slightest. 

Secondly, at what point do you stop considering it self defense? What the Germans did would be equivalent to me attacking four of my neighbors because I assume that they're going to attack me at some point in the future. 

Thirdly, was it really even seen as self defense internally? The Germans had been planning for a war in which they would occupy a plurality of mainland Europe since Germany was an independent state. That sounds less like self defense, and more like premeditated murder.
                    Schlieffen Plan Best Plan
                Yeah, the Germans weren't so bad. They just wanted to intimidate a neutral country so they could march their army through it, to attack another neutral country. 
                    I'm not trying to defend the German logic, what they did to Belgium in WW1 is some absolutely awful stuff...also France was in no way neutral at that point...when Germany declared war on Russia after Russia first declared war on Austria-Hungary for invading Russia-supported Serbia, France and England both declared war on Germany a whole two weeks before Germany enacted their plan
                        

1. What do you mean "France was in now way neutral at that point"? One of the reasons the Schlieffen Plan failed was because the French were hesitant to mobilize, and at the Skirmish at Joncherey the French moved their troops 10 km from their own border in order to show the Germans they did not want war.

2. Austria-Hungary was the one to declare war on Russia, not the other way around, and at that point Germany had already declared war on Russia (Germany was the one to declare war).

3. War was not declared between Austria-Hungary and Russia until August 6, 1914. Three days after Germany had declared war on France, two days after Germany had invaded Belgium, and four days after Germany had invaded Luxembourg. I have no idea what you mean by "France and England both declared war on Germany a whole two weeks before Germany enacted their plan"
        Would you like a lesson, sir, in the rules of war? Or perhaps your children would?
    And even when the Germans first started using gas, they exploited loopholes that technically circumvented the Hague provisions against chemical warfare (let's just leave these canisters of chlorine gas open and let the wind take it across no man's land). But after first Ypres it's horror became pretty apparent to everyone, even the Germans.
    Im sorry, is this part of the Geneva Convention? 

If it isnt, wouldn't that make it... you know... irrelevant? 

Edit: OPs post is specificallly talking about the Geneva Convention of 1928, aka the Geneva Protocol, that banned gasses in war *because of* ww1. Other written rules of war are completely irrelevant to this post.   Ya'll niggas need some google skills.  
        There were documents of international rights and practice of war that existed before the Geneva convention. That was written in 1907 and WWI was 1914-1918. 
            Actually the first Geneva Convention was held in the 1800s, but it doesnt change the fact that OPs post is specifically talking about the Geneva Convention (of 1926) which banned gas in war, so other written rules of war are, as I said, irrelevant.  
                The OPs post is about the legality of gas attacks during warfare, which is why he posted the prior precedent.  Relevant and informative.
                    You may wanna reread his post then.
                        Can't understand why you are downvoted.
                            Because people are dumb. Simple as that, and nothing can be done about it.
                        The OP in this context is the person who started this comment chain.
                            But that's the person I'm saying posted an irrelevant.... fuck it I'm done.
                                Ok then. The guy posted something that shows using poisons in warfare was prohibited before WW1 started. In the picture posted by OP someone says that's it's ok to use gas because the Geneva Convention hasn't been written yet, therefore it is relevant.
                    That's only partly true. OPs post is specifically about the Geneva convention.
                You really struggle at reading comprehension, social awareness and basic context, don't you?
        For everybody fighting here; both are correct.

Yes, gas was against the rules of war as per the Hague Convention. BUT tha dood is also correct that the Convention in question was specifically the Geneva Convention, which had not yet taken place. So while they may be pedantic, they are still correct. 

Everybody is correct. Nobody fucking cares, it's all a joke.
I invented Kamikaze flights long before their time. Almost every time I get in a plane, in fact. 
Edit OPs post is specifically about the Geneva Convention of 1928, aka the Geneva convention.
It's the hague accords that bans specific types of weapons and munitions. The geneva conventions mostly concerns prisoners, non-combatants, etc.

The hague accords did ban poison gas in artillery munitions, which is why the first few times the Germans deployed the gas they actually basically opened barrels filled with the stuff when the wind conditions were right. But eventually as the war went on people got away from using that legal pretense.
    Holy. Pedant. 
I think its hilarious u kids talking shit about Germany. U wouldn't say this shit to him at lan, hes jacked, not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants, and hangs with the hottest bitches. Yall are pathetic lol.
In the Hague Convention (1899) gas grenades/projectiles were banned.

Germany, however, simply waited until the wind was at their backs and opened up some gas canisters. The gas was wafted into the enemy trenches, and that was that.

The war went on, and people stopped following rules so exactly. But I do find it funny that the Germans took it seriously enough to find a loophole at first.
Actually there was one convention before WW I that the powers banned Hemical weapons but the germans first used it in i think1914/15 and quickly then USA, french and UK started using it without respecting so he is right to some extend

    Germans were the first to use lethal gas. French had already used tear gas in a few battles. 

Both sides then started trying to one-up each other on lethal gas despite both the Entente and Central Powers being signatories to the Hauge Convention (not the Geneva Convention).
        But they didn't violate the convention rules as it bans gas projectiles. The first time gas was used the Germans simply opened containers of chlorine gas while the wind was at their backs. 
            Nice comment. Read that anywhere? ;)
                Ah, looked at your post history and it seems you're insinuating I read your reply and then typed mine. But if you look at the times, I posted my reply 2 hours *before* yours. Good try.
                    Wow that's actually really strange that we both used almost identical wording. 

Maybe it's one of those things where I read yours and subconsciously typed it thinking it was my own original thought.

Regardless, I was just fucking with you. Couldn't care less whether or not someone used my comment on reddit. 
                ? Do you want sources? I know this from my knowledge of WWI history. First learned about it I think when I was listening to Dan Carlin's hardcore history podcast, I think episode 2 or 3 of blueprint for Armageddon.
    And sinking civilian merchant ships, and feigning surrender, and murdering POWS; problem with international law in WWI is, how close to losing a war would you get before you'd start breaking it?
You Germans aren't aloud to use shotguns 
    It was the Americans who used shotguns...
        Ya but it was Germans who banned use of them meaning German soldiers aren't aloud to use them but Americans didn't ban them so they were aloud to use well the Germans were not 
            Why did the germans ban use of them?

                I think it was because they caused internal bleeding/wounds that were hard to treat and caused many deaths so Germany called them inhuman and tried to get them bannned
                    Oh, thanks
            Oh, thank you!
    Should they be more quiet then?
They must be thinking of the Hague convention. Germany got around it by burying the gas canisters and opening the lids on them. The convention technically only outlawed throwing containers that would forcibly expel the gas
And now you know
However, gas was against the Hag convention 
You know what is annoying though? People shooting at parachuters, fuck those people

It was denounced as "Against all the rules of war" though.

jesus.. do people take this game that seriously? I prefer fucking around. 
Didn't both sides use gas in WWII as well (illegally)? I remember reading a story about the allies disposing of gas munitions by dumping them into the ocean after the war was finished. 
Those Germans love their gas 
Gas is why it was written in the first place. 
Bayonets were fround upon as well at the time
It's all true.

Lmfao, you can make what ever rules of war you want, but how are you going to enforce them?
Some of it/them had 😂
The google is strong in this thread.
I know this is a joke, but in BF3 i actually didn't shoot at people coming down with parachutes. Just thought it was a nice thing to keep to the Geneva conventions, even if it's just a game.
I think there was some kind of agreement not to use gas but the Germans started using it and then everyone soon followed. Learned it from the YouTube series about the history of WWI.
    The French started it with tear gas but that wasn't really seen as a violation but one thing led to another and everyone was gasing everyone in the end, I do think the Germans used the first lethal chemical gas though if I remember correctly, go watch The Great War on YouTube if you want to learn more.
        Yeah I actually heard it from that series. Great videos.
I've run into a few of these as well and have been accepted into the group when you start bs'ing with them ha

Seriously though stop using gas, it makes you look like a noob
    But doesn't enemy death mean that the tactic worked, therefor making them look like a victor?
        Gas hardly ever kills anyone, just annoys and forces both sides into an endless stalemate of SMG's and shotguns
            i dunno if you used it, gas actually kills a whole lot of people, and even when it doesn't it can still be used tactically.

tl;dr you're a scrub
                Tactically? Yeah like forcing your teammates to have terrible suppression effects for 15+ seconds when you guys spam it everywhere? Amazing tactics, good job.

    Oh thank god I thought I was the only one, I remember an Amiens game becoming a lot more intense when a bunch of seemingly okay players suddenly started talking about how race mixing is destroying Europe and how we need to "keep our blood pure by deporting all non-whites"

Yeah there are a lot of racists playing battlefield for some reason 
        It's extra surreal when you're on a European server and you get actual irl Germans from 2017, on the virtual German team from 1917, raving about Jewish socialism raping German culture and destroying the continent. 
            Now this was something I did not expect to read
        I think 99% of those people are just kidding around. I'm an extremely mild mannered person "in real life." But when I'm on battlefield 1 I don't know what happens to me. Something takes over and I have to teabag absolutely everyone and remind everyone that their mothers all blew me last night.  

It's cathartic. 
            I dunno man, they've all seemed pretty serious so far, there's a difference between excessive jokes and genuinely expressing an argument to deport everyone who isn't white 

Also I don't really buy the kidding around thing, still seems super immature and makes the game feel kinda toxic, if you get catharsis from acting like an 8 year old then there's something wrong with you

    Well those are just happy accidents
It's ok I never hit any of them anyway
    lol i know that feeling
Is there a reason for that or just a matter of respect in militaries?
    It's because when parachuting, you are considered to be a non threat and defenseless because you have no avenue of escaping enemy fire. So you are essentially at that point a non-combatant until you reach the ground, which makes shooting at you a war crime. HOWEVER, this only applies to ejecting pilots. The law of war does not prohibit firing upon paratroops or other persons who are or appear to be bound upon hostile missions while such persons are descending by parachute. Persons other than those mentioned in the preceding sentence who are descending by parachute from disabled aircraft may not be fired upon.
        But people bailing on bf1 have a weapon with them.
            All pilots have a standard issue sidearm for defense if they need to eject. It can also be used to hunt for food while waiting for rescue from remote areas. 
                I wouldn't really consider a double barreled shotgun a standard issue sidearm.
                    It's also a video game. I'm talking more about in real life. 
                        Yea I get too into these discussions.
                    6 years but whatever

In real life, double barreled shotguns were used for SIS pilots due to the fact they could be used for hunting. Most had slugs and birdshot. This includes during ww1

Another cool fact is that in WW2, there was a German double barrel which also had a rifle attached that pilots used. The rifle commonly used soft point rounds which were illegal to shoot people with, but were fine against animals.
                        That actually makes alot of sense, you learn something new everyday haha.
                            The More You Moe
          I feel like it is about pilots being valuable POWs. I don't know how to say it outside of chivallary. Personally I would say shoot them, because it is war. Especially if they just bombed a position. Pilots are expensive to train and use.

 You cannot hold back in a total war scenario. What if they get back to friendlies and fly again just to kill more of your side.

 I would hate myself for sure, but you have a gun and an expensive asset which is dangerous. If I had the skill to just shoot the parachute just enough to make them break their legs I would.
            I appreciate this response.
                 Thanks. I would feel guilty if I ever did it especially prioritizing life as an asset, but pretty sure I would be enraged in full war if I saw the destruction on my friends or such by pilots while being a grunt or such, and wouldn't give two fucks.

 Pilots who hit the ground still are a danger. Do they not carry pistols?

 I don't know honestly. War sucks, period. Even these videos of Ukraine is just like hell, how many soldiers just died.

 Pilots shouldn't be immune to that. No difference in pushing a button as an asset or a grunt pulling a trigger. Short of cost. Feels bad man typing this.

            Or Arm Bears.  That shit gets out of hand real fast.
        The thing is though America was not involved until the interception of the Zimmerman telegram and after a ton of US ships were sunk but gas was still being used before they joined
            The Germans initially used the gas, and the way they did it was by burying the cylinders into the ground and taking the lids off when the wind was to their backs. Their thought was that by doing it that way it wasn't a violation of The Hague convention. After a few grizzly uses of this, the brits and French said fuck it, and put it in their artillery rounds because fuck you, the Germans opened Pandora's box by using it first. 

Source - dan carlin's hardcore history
        > don't sink boats we like

We didn't really care about the Lusitania, only 128 Americans died. You're statement still stands though, since the U.S.S. Maine started the Span-Am war.
            Newspapers started the Spanish-American War. 
                Hearst started the Spanish-American war*
                    Hearst and Pulitzer
        It was a *British* Vessel, Germany *did* say they were going to sink in months in advance, Germany *also* said it was because passenger vessels were carrying arms for Britain and uh... yeah it all turned out to be true.
            It had over 100 Americans on it and already a few Americans had died on other ships sank by the Germans. Still, fuck Britain for carrying arms on a passenger ship. It's like using a human shield.
        I know you said among others.. but i like how you mentioned US but not Russia, as if it wasn't a way bigger player in the war...
        George carlin once said "If you have brown people, we will bomb you!"
        the hero we needed in 1916
        Well it was still a war between signatory powers, even if the US wasn't one. Them not adopting it doesn't mean they aren't bound by it.
        If you don't want your passenger boats sunk, don't fill them with munitions. 
        Gas was used long before the US entered the war in April 1917.  The Battle of Ypres saw the first use of poison gas l, by Germany, in 1915.  

If anything the Hague Conferences were an effort by the ruling European parties to try and slow down the massive arms race that exploded at the turn of the century.  To the monarchs, especially Tsar Nicholas of Russia, the massive stockpiling and development of new arms posed a direct threat to their power in the long run.  This was especially true with Russia, who was farther behind in industrialization than its Western European counterparts.

Therefore, it could be argued that the agreements at the Hague Conferences were more of an attempt to "slow down" the arms race rather than stop it completely.  That would explain why many of the propositions at the Hague Conference either had a short expiration date or why some of the other more developed powers decided not to sign them.
            Interesting points, but you're like 3 months late haha

        That doesn't sound very fun!
            I guess you had to be there.
>Projectiles 

thats why germans used gas cylinders
    came here to say this. They "released" the gas
        I'm imagining them opening up cans with one hand pinching their nose like it's that Tupperware you left in the refrigerator for far too long.
            Pretty much, only relying on wind direction not to blow it back in your face and gas masks with very limited effectiveness instead of pinching their nose.
                Yeah I remembered they time they did that and the wind changed and they killed their own first wave of troops. 
                    I believe that was the first British use.  When the Germans first used chlorine gas (they had already attempted to use "tear gas" on the russians)  they devastated the French colonial troops impacted. It's believed that if they had actually pushed the gap instead of using it as a test they could have opened up the lines. 
                        The French were the first to use gas, but it was tear gas. Germany used lethal gas first. 
            What do you think they're barbarians? Of course they used clothespins instead of their fingers; they had the technology.
            There were instances where the gas they released did blow back into their own lines.
            Probably in the beginning it was similar to that haha! They had to time it with the wind direction (which was typically blowing towards the German lines).
                Why didn't they shoot it then behind enemy lines
                    From the Hague Convention of 1899

>This declaration states that, in any war between signatory powers, the parties will abstain from using **projectiles** "the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases." Ratified by all major powers, except the United States.
            PROTIP: Baked beans work great as a mold starter. 
            Put it in the freezer, then take it out for a bit and open it inside a bin bag
    Ding ding ding. We have a winner. It was a loophole but I think they eventually used gas projectiles towards the end of the war when they were losing.
        Both sides did, IIRC the British were the first to use them 
            The Germans were the first to use gas. They attempted it against the Russians early in the war, but it was too cold. Later they caused a massive gas cloud at Ypres that was the first successful gassing of the war.
                Operation Disinfection
                Sorry, I thought we were referring to the first to use real projectiles 
                    Depends on your definition of projectiles, but in both instances I believe they were fired as artillery shells that released gas on impact.
                        At Bolimów I think so, not at Ypres though. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres):
>German troops carried 5,730 gas cylinders, weighing 90 pounds (41 kg) each, to the front by hand. The cylinders, opened by hand, relied on the prevailing wind to carry the gas towards enemy lines. Because of this method of dispersal, a large number of German soldiers were injured or killed while carrying out the attack.
                            Not at the Battle of Ypres, but near Ypres at Langemark according to Wikipedia. Also that's weird, the Wikipedia article and book I'm reading said that Bolimow was an artillery shelling that was ineffective because the it was so cold that the gas froze.
                Not the last time the Germans succeeded in using gas.
        Also, couldn't they have argued there was a purpose for like shrapnel or something? Making it no longer the sole purpose?
    How were they delivered if not being projectiles?
        wind and hope it goes towards enemy
        They were. At Ypres, the first successful gassing, they were fired from artillery. The canisters hit the ground and excreted the gas, which is heavier than air so it sank into the trenches.
    But only related to chlorine gas.  Mustard gas was deployed via shell.  Negating their claim that they were still within the bounds of the Hague convention.
  
"Fatally injured victims sometimes took four or five weeks to die of mustard gas exposure."  Damn...
Actually The Hague convention said gas shells could not be used so the Germans found a technical loophole. When gas was first used the Germans simply opened containers of chlorine gas when the wind was at their backs. *Technically*, it didn't violate the conventions rules as they weren't projectiles.
    so they essentially shit in the wind and let mother nature do the killing?
        Yep. First people to encounter it were Algerian and Canadian troops. Didn't even move, they didn't know what it was. Terrible way to die.

                        I suggest watching "Storming Juno", it covers the Canadian landings. Severely underappreciated movie.
                            Thanks, I'll give that a view
                            Never heard of it, thanks!
                        Or how Canadian troops had the right to liberate Rome. Mark Clark disobeyed orders to flank the city and cut off the German retreat, instead he marched American troops through the city. 
                    Also gonna add that we were in both world wars before the United States since we still had strong ties to Britain
                    back in early 2000's afghabistan photos were leaked showing Canadian special forces dragging prisoners of war into base after a series of highly successful raids. the Canadian DOD (or whatever it's called) was able to cover up their involvement for years by saying they were American troops. 
                    Check out the battle of Beaumont Hamel and the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. An entire colonies army wiped out in less than 10 minutes.
                    Visited Amiens this summer, right before the centennial for the battle of the Somme, and the Canadians had a very nice memorial/ museum, and it's one of the only places where you can walk through original trenches. I think it was the spot where the Newfoundland regiment earned their"Royal" status as they fought like crazy and lost an enormous amount of their forces.
                    My great grandfather was a canadian soldier in WW1. Took an MG burst to the arm and lost the whole thing.

That man was amazing.

Always used to say the best day of his life was the day they came out with Velcro laced shoes...
                Yes I am aware of all this, though you must keep in mind the Canadians would have been completely routed had the German high command known how effective the gas attacks would've been. It was supposed to be just a test to see how the gas would work, no one was expecting for it to decimate enemy lines. That's not to take away from the incredible bravery and courage of the Canadians, but the German failure can be really pinned on the high command for not planning for a full attack after the gas attacks, or at least saving the gas for a true offensive. 
                Surely the guy had to have had some formal education in sciences? How else does one "realize" that pissing on a cloth and breathing through it lets you survive the gas?

Then the explanation was added later.
                    They have these short clips they play on CBC showing epic historical moments in Canadian history and there was one about this. I think he was a chemistry teacher or something. 
    I learned this from Hardcore History!
    Still a dick move, but something tells me  they  weren't too worried about that.
As mentioned below this outlawed projectiles which is why the initial use of gas in WWI was by just opening containers and letting it drift with the wind. I think it is more interesting that the escalation from there shows how "laws of war" work in general. 

When you think about it you probably wonder who enforces the laws of war: There is no policeman of war, certainly Ares will not come down and punish the guilty.

What happens is kind of a multi step process.

1. First it is a gentleman's agreement between nations. Country A and B basically have a discussion some time before the war and say "If we go to war you don't do X, and we won't either. Then we can have a good clean war!"

2. Country A breaks rule X, probably just a little. Now what? Well Country B has already stopped trading with them, so sanctions are not going to be an added punishment. The only thing B can do is to take reprisals by engaging in the same banned activity or a different (hopefully proportional) banned activity.

3. Now Country A is not happy. Sure they may have broken rule X, but they feel like Country B is breaking the rules worse than they did. Country A expands their banned practices a bit. Bit by bit the war, which was probably hell anyway, gets worse and worse for the countries involved. 20 years later these two countries are used as an example of why you don't engage in military practices that everyone agreed not to do.
    >When you think about it you probably wonder who enforces the laws of war: There is no policeman of war

The winner is judge, jury, and persecutor (sic). The policemen are the soldiers and whoever has the biggest and best police force get to uphold their laws.
        Yeah that's why you don't start fights you can't finish...*Japan*. 
    Country A is a dick for breaking the rules first, I totally understand country B though, just trying to stay alive
    WWII expresses the "gentlemen's agreement" very well if you look at The Nazis' attitude towards the different fronts. WWI does as well but not to the extremes of the second.
    Well Ares certainly won't. I didn't kill him in God of War for nothing
The Germans tried to get around it initially by opening up well positioned cans full of gas when the wind condition was right. They claimed that they weren't using the asphyxiant as a projectile with that method.
Mustard gas is also okay because it's asphyxiating **and** deleterious.
Hey! That says "using projectiles". There isn't anything wrong with just opening canisters of gas when it is windy, right?
Also, another fun fact: France was the first country to use a gas (tear gas iirc) in WWI. Germany just went above and beyond in retaliation. 
    Tear gas sounds much more humane compared to deadly chlorine though. I doubt soldiers died due to any tear gas. Police uses it extensively during most protests/rallies nowadays. 
Yep, Gas WAS Illegal, the second Hague Convention further extended the list of banned weapons of war against signatory powers. Once one side broke the  treaty however (Germany in Ypres), all bets were off. The Allies ended up using more gas than the Central Powers if I recall correctly.
Yup, the Germans way around that was to launch artillery shells with a special casing around it to where it would technically not be against the hague convention.
If I am not mistaken, they loopholed this by having gas canisters planted in the field and then releasing the gas with the wind.
Good Ol Russians making this happen

    I assume you'd just remember Hague convention, that what you're talking about or trying to remember has to do with gas warfare, Google it and voila. Much like many other things we remember snippets of it and through research, be it going to the library or referencing a book of yore or Googling it, you find the exact place it is in and cite it.

This is also the reason why those with great memory and read/watch things a lot tend to be able to write research work pretty quickly and accurately. I know it took a tenth of the time for me to write anything versus that of the average of my university mates.
You're correct, but the German's went around this by opening gas containers down wind from the enemy. Causing it to drift to their lines. Thus making it not being used in a projectile form.
Didn't Germany use chlorine gas all the time in WW1 though?
The use of poison gas performed by all major belligerents throughout World War I constituted war crimes as its use violated the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited the use of "poison or poisoned weapons" in warfare.
  
So pretty much every nation involved in WWI committed war crimes according to the Hague conventions.
I've got to say. I went through about eightish minutes worth of this thread before I remembered I'm in the Battlefield 1 subreddit and not some r/history thread.
Projectiles... so you're saying I can still run around with a large gas canister as a backpack and try to trailgaser people?
Was gonna say this.
Yet the US didn't use gas themselves. They made some for other Entente countries though. 
This doesn't even get into the fact that the way gas was initially used was as a released cloud to skirt these exact conventions. The specific mention of projectiles was meant to stop the use of gas in artillery shells, so what the hell who cares about releasing a giant cloud of gas and having it roll down wind, right?
You can also use gas against your own civilians.

Who cares about the peasants.
Hitler did nothing wrong


    He's just a kid, leave him alone!
        He fought in WWI, little older than a kid. 

People would joke years later about how they had the opportunity to shoot Hitler in WWI but didn't. If they only knew. 

I forget exactly who it was Hitler met with, but they shared war stories and found out they were at the same place,  at the same time on opposing fronts. They were in trenches 70 yards across from each other. That's when they would joke with the person and say how he had the chance to shoot him, haha. 
            Wasn't he like a message runner though? 
                He had an iron cross first class which were not given out lightly
                    Say what you want about Hitler but he was a fanatical soilder. He put his life on the line multiple times and I think at one point took 5 French soldiers prisoners by him self. He was a very good ground solider. Luckily I suppose that doesn't translate into a good person.... I would say leader but he was arguably a good leader.... just sucked at the human rights shit and military problems.
                        Most of his stories are proven fabricated. The capture of the French soldiers being the most notable. 
                            Oh shit.... Is that true? 

Now I need to go read up on that.... If that is the case then my bad. Its really hard to tell with Hitler because so many things have been slandered because of what he did
                                Yeah I agree. There's never been a slander campaign like the one after WWII. History will be written by the victors.
                        Maybe fighting in the war fucked his head up 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
                            After listening to the absolute horrors of that war I'm inclined to agree. And there can be no doubt that the terms the French and English forced on the Germans paved the way to Hitler taking power.
                        He wasn't even that bad with the military problems as a leader. He was heavily involved with the planning and execution of the invasions of Poland and France, and some of his suggestions for those plans turned out to be highly successful. His failures as a military leader can pretty much all be chalked up to British intelligence being really good at its job or Hitler's inner circle being filled with sycophants giving him inaccurate reports. 
                    Most of Hitler's great militaristic achievements never occurred, they were mainly made up by the Nazi regime during their reign. It was done to glorify Hitler and portray him as this strong militia who fought heroicly against the enemies
                        As far as I know no one has been able to convincingly discount the military honours he very clearly had since before anyone thought anything of him politically
                "You know what we usually say? Well just shoot _that_ one."
                Being a message runner could mean running through some pretty dangerous conditions under bombardment and gas attack and etc. though. It wasn't like he got a safe job. I mean he was injured and hospitalized twice in the war, once when a shell hit his dugout, and another from a gas attack.
                You say that as if it was some lowly position.   Runners had stones and that was recognized.  
            On October 14, 1918, Hitler himself got wounded by gas.
                Its why he never resorted to using it against enemy combatants. 
                    Yup! Just some Jews, but who cares about them right guys!
            Yeah but then maybe Rommel or Goebbels would have risen to power, and they weren't as insane and stupid as Hitler was, they might have actually made the war last longer

    You spelled national hero wrong. He did get the iron cross afterall
    idk, i heard he made some terrible art
        It was decent
    [Did you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRPEsRp3utc) that the Germans were not prone to using gas weapons in WWII because of Hitlers experience and injuries suffered from them during WWI while he served in the German military.
        I think it could be argued that gas weapons of the time would not have been nearly as useful in WW2. They were a hassle to use even in WW1 with static positions on both sides. Considering the nature of WW2, if people thought that gas was a war-winner, you can be sure they'd use it.
    Here you dropped this: /s

        Oh thanks, I really thought he is dead serious haha

    Dang, that's a good joke. I didn't get it before the edit.
    Even if one thought that Hitler did nothing *morally* wrong, I think everybody can agree that he did things wrong *strategically*
    Didn't Hitler still fight for the Germans in WW1 though?
        Nobody was right in WW1, people fought for their homelands.  Even Anne Franks' father was a soldier for the German army.
            WW1 is not the black and what good vs evil war that WW2 was.

It's pretty much a decade
                            So the US didnt invade Iraq to stop ISIS after 9/11??
It kinda surprises me that Hitler never used gas in combat considering how frivolous he was with it elsewhere. 
    He experienced it and was afraid it would be used against his own troops, IIRC. Obviously the Jews were a different subject for him.
    With the amount of civilian bombing in WW2 on both sides, adding gas would of been terrifying.

Just team chat in general would be nice. There are so few people on consuls mic'd up that having it so you can only talk to your squad is pretty much pointless. 
    But typing on console is ridiculous and by the time you could type a sentence you'd be dead.
        They could make better/customizable presets for chat, like in rocket league. Wow!
            Yeah. I play a lot of overwatch and I wish for that too. The presets they have are useful but sometimes you just need to be able to say "go healer" "why are you two the same hero?!?!" "Why is our team all stack  heroes we're defending!"
                Hanzo is totally a healer, he just prevents the damage from happening in the first place.

                Right number in bf1
            They should at least add a quick button for "Thanks" on pc. 

so many times when I see a medic coming all the way from 20 meters to revive me and it's just a hustle to use that chat wheel to say Thanks  in the middle of combat. I can't count the times I died while trying to wheel chat to say thanks and get killed again :/

Overwatch has a single button for saying Thanks iirc, 1 click and it says thanks. 
            We have Go Go Go, but I need Go left, Go right, stop.
            Or release a chatpad for the controller like the 360. 
            Apex has a very simple and effective communication system also. Don't know why there are some things all games just dont adopt.
        I don't disagree with that. What i'm getting at is more that it would be helpful to be able to voice chat with the whole team and not just your squad. 
            Oh yeah. I misunderstood your comment.
        No you just face the wall and no one attacks you. It's law 
        We're talking about BF1, you're dead anyway. 
    And the ones that do are playing shitty rap music in the mic
    I had to turn VOIP off on console. Too much distracting chatter and random noises. Probably the environment the Console player is in. Whereas with PC at least they're predominantly in an isolated area of the house (apologies for the generalisation). 
        That makes sense. Consoles are generally in a living room where the family gathers, where as a lot of people will have a dedicated computer room or area. 
    Also now with party chat via psn even if a couple people are mic'd up they are probably chatting in party chat. On ps3 I made a lot of gaming friends by just getting into a game where a couple of them were already friends and chatting. Usually people were stoked to find someone else with a mic on. Now (at least in my experience) we all talk in a party outside the game.
I was playing the for honor beta and teamed up with a German dude. His English was pretty good but has a heavy accent. He lost a long duel when someone else came up and tossed him off the edge. He lost it and went off on the most glorious tirade I've ever heard playing game video games and I didn't understand a word of it.
    Had a similar experience in BF1 but with my Finnish friend. His rant inspired me to start learning that beautiful language lol.
        [This will get you far](http://i.imgur.com/2vhgoGN.png) 
            Wait that phrase means all those things?
                Ofcourse! It would be a shame to waste such a good phrase, so instead of using it once, we can use it multiple times! But don't worry, [finnish language is very well organized](http://i.imgur.com/0bMxF0R.jpg) 
    I play BF with a German dude that I found in a match, now he's an important member of our squad.  Sadly he stays calm and collected most of the time so I don't get to hear any glorious tirades such as you experienced.

Care to share?
    Check out Dan Carlin's hardcore history about WWI. Fucking. Insane.
        also https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGreatWar
        And actually, *any* of the references Carlin frequently cites, particularly Peter Hart and his books about the BEF and Passchendaele are amazing. Even general [Erich von Falkenhayn](https://archive.org/details/germangeneralsta00falk) himself has some unique insight.
    At the 2nd Battle of Ypres the Germans just let loose a ton of gas downwind at the French troops and completely pushed them out. The Germans didn't expect it to succeed so well and didn't have a push planned, so no real territory changed hands. After Ypres troops were better prepared for gas attacks as seen by Canadian troops taking high ground and holding their ground in future attacks.
Yeah, it's not like the idea of rules of war were suddenly thought up after WWI. 
    No, of course, but it is known that the German Kaiser Wilhelm was a firm criticizer of the rules of war. He is famous for saying that the concordats and declarations were just "pieces of paper". You could expect that from a man whose first act of war was attacking a neutral country
        The initial goal wasn't so much to attack Belgium so much as march through it on their way to France, but the Belgians had other plans and delayed the Germans long enough for the Brits and French to prepare themselves and send help
            [deleted]
                Dan Carlin taught me that.
                    I didn't even see your comment, and Dan Carlin popped into my head (Quote: yadda-yadda-yadda.  End Quote.)

Man, if Dan Carlin was a History Teacher or professor, his classes would be full.
                    He taught me that....agin and agin and agin and agin.

I'lll never hear the word again the same, I'll always think of the way he says it.
                    Keith Heading told me that joke!
                Firstly, internally the Holocaust was considered self defense by the Nazis. That doesn't make it any better in the slightest. 

Secondly, at what point do you stop considering it self defense? What the Germans did would be equivalent to me attacking four of my neighbors because I assume that they're going to attack me at some point in the future. 

Thirdly, was it really even seen as self defense internally? The Germans had been planning for a war in which they would occupy a plurality of mainland Europe since Germany was an independent state. That sounds less like self defense, and more like premeditated murder.
                Schlieffen Plan Best Plan
            Yeah, the Germans weren't so bad. They just wanted to intimidate a neutral country so they could march their army through it, to attack another neutral country. 
                I'm not trying to defend the German logic, what they did to Belgium in WW1 is some absolutely awful stuff...also France was in no way neutral at that point...when Germany declared war on Russia after Russia first declared war on Austria-Hungary for invading Russia-supported Serbia, France and England both declared war on Germany a whole two weeks before Germany enacted their plan
                    

1. What do you mean "France was in now way neutral at that point"? One of the reasons the Schlieffen Plan failed was because the French were hesitant to mobilize, and at the Skirmish at Joncherey the French moved their troops 10 km from their own border in order to show the Germans they did not want war.

2. Austria-Hungary was the one to declare war on Russia, not the other way around, and at that point Germany had already declared war on Russia (Germany was the one to declare war).

3. War was not declared between Austria-Hungary and Russia until August 6, 1914. Three days after Germany had declared war on France, two days after Germany had invaded Belgium, and four days after Germany had invaded Luxembourg. I have no idea what you mean by "France and England both declared war on Germany a whole two weeks before Germany enacted their plan"
    Would you like a lesson, sir, in the rules of war? Or perhaps your children would?
And even when the Germans first started using gas, they exploited loopholes that technically circumvented the Hague provisions against chemical warfare (let's just leave these canisters of chlorine gas open and let the wind take it across no man's land). But after first Ypres it's horror became pretty apparent to everyone, even the Germans.
Im sorry, is this part of the Geneva Convention? 

If it isnt, wouldn't that make it... you know... irrelevant? 

Edit: OPs post is specificallly talking about the Geneva Convention of 1928, aka the Geneva Protocol, that banned gasses in war *because of* ww1. Other written rules of war are completely irrelevant to this post.   Ya'll niggas need some google skills.  
    There were documents of international rights and practice of war that existed before the Geneva convention. That was written in 1907 and WWI was 1914-1918. 
        Actually the first Geneva Convention was held in the 1800s, but it doesnt change the fact that OPs post is specifically talking about the Geneva Convention (of 1926) which banned gas in war, so other written rules of war are, as I said, irrelevant.  
            The OPs post is about the legality of gas attacks during warfare, which is why he posted the prior precedent.  Relevant and informative.
                You may wanna reread his post then.
                    Can't understand why you are downvoted.
                        Because people are dumb. Simple as that, and nothing can be done about it.
                    The OP in this context is the person who started this comment chain.
                        But that's the person I'm saying posted an irrelevant.... fuck it I'm done.
                            Ok then. The guy posted something that shows using poisons in warfare was prohibited before WW1 started. In the picture posted by OP someone says that's it's ok to use gas because the Geneva Convention hasn't been written yet, therefore it is relevant.
                That's only partly true. OPs post is specifically about the Geneva convention.
            You really struggle at reading comprehension, social awareness and basic context, don't you?
    For everybody fighting here; both are correct.

Yes, gas was against the rules of war as per the Hague Convention. BUT tha dood is also correct that the Convention in question was specifically the Geneva Convention, which had not yet taken place. So while they may be pedantic, they are still correct. 

Everybody is correct. Nobody fucking cares, it's all a joke.
Holy. Pedant. 
Germans were the first to use lethal gas. French had already used tear gas in a few battles. 

Both sides then started trying to one-up each other on lethal gas despite both the Entente and Central Powers being signatories to the Hauge Convention (not the Geneva Convention).
    But they didn't violate the convention rules as it bans gas projectiles. The first time gas was used the Germans simply opened containers of chlorine gas while the wind was at their backs. 
        Nice comment. Read that anywhere? ;)
            Ah, looked at your post history and it seems you're insinuating I read your reply and then typed mine. But if you look at the times, I posted my reply 2 hours *before* yours. Good try.
                Wow that's actually really strange that we both used almost identical wording. 

Maybe it's one of those things where I read yours and subconsciously typed it thinking it was my own original thought.

Regardless, I was just fucking with you. Couldn't care less whether or not someone used my comment on reddit. 
            ? Do you want sources? I know this from my knowledge of WWI history. First learned about it I think when I was listening to Dan Carlin's hardcore history podcast, I think episode 2 or 3 of blueprint for Armageddon.
And sinking civilian merchant ships, and feigning surrender, and murdering POWS; problem with international law in WWI is, how close to losing a war would you get before you'd start breaking it?
It was the Americans who used shotguns...
    Ya but it was Germans who banned use of them meaning German soldiers aren't aloud to use them but Americans didn't ban them so they were aloud to use well the Germans were not 
        Why did the germans ban use of them?
            To op
                Lol
            I think it was because they caused internal bleeding/wounds that were hard to treat and caused many deaths so Germany called them inhuman and tried to get them bannned
                Oh, thanks
        Oh, thank you!
Should they be more quiet then?
The French started it with tear gas but that wasn't really seen as a violation but one thing led to another and everyone was gasing everyone in the end, I do think the Germans used the first lethal chemical gas though if I remember correctly, go watch The Great War on YouTube if you want to learn more.
    Yeah I actually heard it from that series. Great videos.
I don't understand how game devs don't just add a chatbox and enable keyboard support. Hell, both the 360 and ps3 supported keyboards for typing messages, ffs. 
Already seen the ones you mentioned me in lol
When I'm mic'd up I usually shout "FIX bayonets!" Like the characters before we start. And try to pretend I'm in the game. "It's an honor dying with you men!" "We're out manned and outgunned!" 
    *affix bayonets
        but is bayonet is broken!

Have a nice day 
*1918 and bf1 stretches the truth a bit. ;)
But doesn't enemy death mean that the tactic worked, therefor making them look like a victor?
    Gas hardly ever kills anyone, just annoys and forces both sides into an endless stalemate of SMG's and shotguns
        i dunno if you used it, gas actually kills a whole lot of people, and even when it doesn't it can still be used tactically.

tl;dr you're a scrub
            Tactically? Yeah like forcing your teammates to have terrible suppression effects for 15+ seconds when you guys spam it everywhere? Amazing tactics, good job.
Whining about it makes you look like a noob.
    Whining about me whining makes you look like a noob
Hey man, 1918 was a different time.

    It's weird I see a huge overlap between racists and video games. I never see this in sports or even sport games.  It's interesting bc it used to be jocks who were assholes but nowadays they're all the dickheads are nerds.
        That's because you're essentially anonymous when playing video games. 
        i mean most of the racism is to be an "edgy memester"
        People will say anything when their face is hidden behind a computer screen.
            anything
         Because people who play video games are gross
        Jocks play video games
    Red Orchestra is full of them, specifically if you play on the German side
        Yeah. The White Supremacists never play as the Soviets, and I'm sure everyone can guess why.
    I don't know, I feel like I would be hard-pressed to find an opponent on chess.com who's fucked my mom
Oh thank god I thought I was the only one, I remember an Amiens game becoming a lot more intense when a bunch of seemingly okay players suddenly started talking about how race mixing is destroying Europe and how we need to "keep our blood pure by deporting all non-whites"

Yeah there are a lot of racists playing battlefield for some reason 
    It's extra surreal when you're on a European server and you get actual irl Germans from 2017, on the virtual German team from 1917, raving about Jewish socialism raping German culture and destroying the continent. 
        Now this was something I did not expect to read
    I think 99% of those people are just kidding around. I'm an extremely mild mannered person "in real life." But when I'm on battlefield 1 I don't know what happens to me. Something takes over and I have to teabag absolutely everyone and remind everyone that their mothers all blew me last night.  

It's cathartic. 
        I dunno man, they've all seemed pretty serious so far, there's a difference between excessive jokes and genuinely expressing an argument to deport everyone who isn't white 

Also I don't really buy the kidding around thing, still seems super immature and makes the game feel kinda toxic, if you get catharsis from acting like an 8 year old then there's something wrong with you 
        You're my spirit animal mane 
    I was on, ballroom (can’t remember if that’s the name) and watched two people going at it over one of them having some offensive emblem towards Jewish people, entire chat descended into a lot of Jewish and ww2 jokes…
It's got nothing on wargames warchat
    But there you have all the Eastern Europeans and Russians.
It takes so long to report someone, too. Bloody Origin. 
Oh boy you've never played wargame red dragon have you
White is a nation now?
    [White Nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism). Of course 'white' is not a nation, but it's not even a race. None of their views are based in reality.
I see, you haven't been on /r/altright.
*patriots
Well those are just happy accidents
lol i know that feeling
It's because when parachuting, you are considered to be a non threat and defenseless because you have no avenue of escaping enemy fire. So you are essentially at that point a non-combatant until you reach the ground, which makes shooting at you a war crime. HOWEVER, this only applies to ejecting pilots. The law of war does not prohibit firing upon paratroops or other persons who are or appear to be bound upon hostile missions while such persons are descending by parachute. Persons other than those mentioned in the preceding sentence who are descending by parachute from disabled aircraft may not be fired upon.
    But people bailing on bf1 have a weapon with them.
        All pilots have a standard issue sidearm for defense if they need to eject. It can also be used to hunt for food while waiting for rescue from remote areas. 
            I wouldn't really consider a double barreled shotgun a standard issue sidearm.
                It's also a video game. I'm talking more about in real life. 
                    Yea I get too into these discussions.
                6 years but whatever

In real life, double barreled shotguns were used for SIS pilots due to the fact they could be used for hunting. Most had slugs and birdshot. This includes during ww1

Another cool fact is that in WW2, there was a German double barrel which also had a rifle attached that pilots used. The rifle commonly used soft point rounds which were illegal to shoot people with, but were fine against animals.
                    That actually makes alot of sense, you learn something new everyday haha.
                        The More You Moe
      I feel like it is about pilots being valuable POWs. I don't know how to say it outside of chivallary. Personally I would say shoot them, because it is war. Especially if they just bombed a position. Pilots are expensive to train and use.

 You cannot hold back in a total war scenario. What if they get back to friendlies and fly again just to kill more of your side.

 I would hate myself for sure, but you have a gun and an expensive asset which is dangerous. If I had the skill to just shoot the parachute just enough to make them break their legs I would.
        I appreciate this response.
             Thanks. I would feel guilty if I ever did it especially prioritizing life as an asset, but pretty sure I would be enraged in full war if I saw the destruction on my friends or such by pilots while being a grunt or such, and wouldn't give two fucks.

 Pilots who hit the ground still are a danger. Do they not carry pistols?

 I don't know honestly. War sucks, period. Even these videos of Ukraine is just like hell, how many soldiers just died.

 Pilots shouldn't be immune to that. No difference in pushing a button as an asset or a grunt pulling a trigger. Short of cost. Feels bad man typing this.

                    Wars for tea and opium too. 
                    Yep. There was also one over a bucket. There are a lot of stupid wars. Such as the Emo Wars.
            Unless you're Saudi Arabia of course. 
                Paying us off first before you fuck us
            U think it's still about oil mate?
        Or Arm Bears.  That shit gets out of hand real fast.
    The thing is though America was not involved until the interception of the Zimmerman telegram and after a ton of US ships were sunk but gas was still being used before they joined
        The Germans initially used the gas, and the way they did it was by burying the cylinders into the ground and taking the lids off when the wind was to their backs. Their thought was that by doing it that way it wasn't a violation of The Hague convention. After a few grizzly uses of this, the brits and French said fuck it, and put it in their artillery rounds because fuck you, the Germans opened Pandora's box by using it first. 

Source - dan carlin's hardcore history
    > don't sink boats we like

We didn't really care about the Lusitania, only 128 Americans died. You're statement still stands though, since the U.S.S. Maine started the Span-Am war.
        Newspapers started the Spanish-American War. 
            Hearst started the Spanish-American war*
                Hearst and Pulitzer
    It was a *British* Vessel, Germany *did* say they were going to sink in months in advance, Germany *also* said it was because passenger vessels were carrying arms for Britain and uh... yeah it all turned out to be true.
        It had over 100 Americans on it and already a few Americans had died on other ships sank by the Germans. Still, fuck Britain for carrying arms on a passenger ship. It's like using a human shield.
    I know you said among others.. but i like how you mentioned US but not Russia, as if it wasn't a way bigger player in the war...
    George carlin once said "If you have brown people, we will bomb you!"
    the hero we needed in 1916
    Well it was still a war between signatory powers, even if the US wasn't one. Them not adopting it doesn't mean they aren't bound by it.
    If you don't want your passenger boats sunk, don't fill them with munitions. 
    Gas was used long before the US entered the war in April 1917.  The Battle of Ypres saw the first use of poison gas l, by Germany, in 1915.  

If anything the Hague Conferences were an effort by the ruling European parties to try and slow down the massive arms race that exploded at the turn of the century.  To the monarchs, especially Tsar Nicholas of Russia, the massive stockpiling and development of new arms posed a direct threat to their power in the long run.  This was especially true with Russia, who was farther behind in industrialization than its Western European counterparts.

Therefore, it could be argued that the agreements at the Hague Conferences were more of an attempt to "slow down" the arms race rather than stop it completely.  That would explain why many of the propositions at the Hague Conference either had a short expiration date or why some of the other more developed powers decided not to sign them.
        Interesting points, but you're like 3 months late haha
    Or be aggro on Twitter.
        .
    Not that u where needed to win the war. 
So fun fact, Japan had not ratified the Geneva conventions during WW2, so the prosecution of Japanese war crimes was incredibly difficult 
    That doesn't sound very fun!
        I guess you had to be there.
came here to say this. They "released" the gas
    I'm imagining them opening up cans with one hand pinching their nose like it's that Tupperware you left in the refrigerator for far too long.
        Pretty much, only relying on wind direction not to blow it back in your face and gas masks with very limited effectiveness instead of pinching their nose.
            Yeah I remembered they time they did that and the wind changed and they killed their own first wave of troops. 
                I believe that was the first British use.  When the Germans first used chlorine gas (they had already attempted to use "tear gas" on the russians)  they devastated the French colonial troops impacted. It's believed that if they had actually pushed the gap instead of using it as a test they could have opened up the lines. 
                    The French were the first to use gas, but it was tear gas. Germany used lethal gas first. 
        What do you think they're barbarians? Of course they used clothespins instead of their fingers; they had the technology.
        There were instances where the gas they released did blow back into their own lines.
        Probably in the beginning it was similar to that haha! They had to time it with the wind direction (which was typically blowing towards the German lines).
            Why didn't they shoot it then behind enemy lines
                From the Hague Convention of 1899

>This declaration states that, in any war between signatory powers, the parties will abstain from using **projectiles** "the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases." Ratified by all major powers, except the United States.
        PROTIP: Baked beans work great as a mold starter. 
        Put it in the freezer, then take it out for a bit and open it inside a bin bag
Ding ding ding. We have a winner. It was a loophole but I think they eventually used gas projectiles towards the end of the war when they were losing.
    Both sides did, IIRC the British were the first to use them 
        The Germans were the first to use gas. They attempted it against the Russians early in the war, but it was too cold. Later they caused a massive gas cloud at Ypres that was the first successful gassing of the war.
            Operation Disinfection
            Sorry, I thought we were referring to the first to use real projectiles 
                Depends on your definition of projectiles, but in both instances I believe they were fired as artillery shells that released gas on impact.
                    At Bolimów I think so, not at Ypres though. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres):
>German troops carried 5,730 gas cylinders, weighing 90 pounds (41 kg) each, to the front by hand. The cylinders, opened by hand, relied on the prevailing wind to carry the gas towards enemy lines. Because of this method of dispersal, a large number of German soldiers were injured or killed while carrying out the attack.
                        Not at the Battle of Ypres, but near Ypres at Langemark according to Wikipedia. Also that's weird, the Wikipedia article and book I'm reading said that Bolimow was an artillery shelling that was ineffective because the it was so cold that the gas froze.
            Not the last time the Germans succeeded in using gas.
    Also, couldn't they have argued there was a purpose for like shrapnel or something? Making it no longer the sole purpose?
How were they delivered if not being projectiles?
    wind and hope it goes towards enemy
    They were. At Ypres, the first successful gassing, they were fired from artillery. The canisters hit the ground and excreted the gas, which is heavier than air so it sank into the trenches.
But only related to chlorine gas.  Mustard gas was deployed via shell.  Negating their claim that they were still within the bounds of the Hague convention.
  
"Fatally injured victims sometimes took four or five weeks to die of mustard gas exposure."  Damn...
so they essentially shit in the wind and let mother nature do the killing?
    Yep. First people to encounter it were Algerian and Canadian troops. Didn't even move, they didn't know what it was. Terrible way to die.

                Amen, you never hear about their beach invasions of Normandy either. Shame
                    I suggest watching "Storming Juno", it covers the Canadian landings. Severely underappreciated movie.
                        Thanks, I'll give that a view
                        Never heard of it, thanks!
                    Or how Canadian troops had the right to liberate Rome. Mark Clark disobeyed orders to flank the city and cut off the German retreat, instead he marched American troops through the city. 
                Also gonna add that we were in both world wars before the United States since we still had strong ties to Britain
                back in early 2000's afghabistan photos were leaked showing Canadian special forces dragging prisoners of war into base after a series of highly successful raids. the Canadian DOD (or whatever it's called) was able to cover up their involvement for years by saying they were American troops. 
                Check out the battle of Beaumont Hamel and the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. An entire colonies army wiped out in less than 10 minutes.
                Visited Amiens this summer, right before the centennial for the battle of the Somme, and the Canadians had a very nice memorial/ museum, and it's one of the only places where you can walk through original trenches. I think it was the spot where the Newfoundland regiment earned their"Royal" status as they fought like crazy and lost an enormous amount of their forces.
                My great grandfather was a canadian soldier in WW1. Took an MG burst to the arm and lost the whole thing.

That man was amazing.

Always used to say the best day of his life was the day they came out with Velcro laced shoes...
            Yes I am aware of all this, though you must keep in mind the Canadians would have been completely routed had the German high command known how effective the gas attacks would've been. It was supposed to be just a test to see how the gas would work, no one was expecting for it to decimate enemy lines. That's not to take away from the incredible bravery and courage of the Canadians, but the German failure can be really pinned on the high command for not planning for a full attack after the gas attacks, or at least saving the gas for a true offensive. 
            Surely the guy had to have had some formal education in sciences? How else does one "realize" that pissing on a cloth and breathing through it lets you survive the gas?

Then the explanation was added later.
                They have these short clips they play on CBC showing epic historical moments in Canadian history and there was one about this. I think he was a chemistry teacher or something. 
I learned this from Hardcore History!
Still a dick move, but something tells me  they  weren't too worried about that.
>When you think about it you probably wonder who enforces the laws of war: There is no policeman of war

The winner is judge, jury, and persecutor (sic). The policemen are the soldiers and whoever has the biggest and best police force get to uphold their laws.
    Yeah that's why you don't start fights you can't finish...*Japan*. 
Country A is a dick for breaking the rules first, I totally understand country B though, just trying to stay alive
WWII expresses the "gentlemen's agreement" very well if you look at The Nazis' attitude towards the different fronts. WWI does as well but not to the extremes of the second.
Well Ares certainly won't. I didn't kill him in God of War for nothing
Tear gas sounds much more humane compared to deadly chlorine though. I doubt soldiers died due to any tear gas. Police uses it extensively during most protests/rallies nowadays. 
I assume you'd just remember Hague convention, that what you're talking about or trying to remember has to do with gas warfare, Google it and voila. Much like many other things we remember snippets of it and through research, be it going to the library or referencing a book of yore or Googling it, you find the exact place it is in and cite it.

This is also the reason why those with great memory and read/watch things a lot tend to be able to write research work pretty quickly and accurately. I know it took a tenth of the time for me to write anything versus that of the average of my university mates.
He's just a kid, leave him alone!
    He fought in WWI, little older than a kid. 

People would joke years later about how they had the opportunity to shoot Hitler in WWI but didn't. If they only knew. 

I forget exactly who it was Hitler met with, but they shared war stories and found out they were at the same place,  at the same time on opposing fronts. They were in trenches 70 yards across from each other. That's when they would joke with the person and say how he had the chance to shoot him, haha. 
        Wasn't he like a message runner though? 
            He had an iron cross first class which were not given out lightly
                Say what you want about Hitler but he was a fanatical soilder. He put his life on the line multiple times and I think at one point took 5 French soldiers prisoners by him self. He was a very good ground solider. Luckily I suppose that doesn't translate into a good person.... I would say leader but he was arguably a good leader.... just sucked at the human rights shit and military problems.
                    Most of his stories are proven fabricated. The capture of the French soldiers being the most notable. 
                        Oh shit.... Is that true? 

Now I need to go read up on that.... If that is the case then my bad. Its really hard to tell with Hitler because so many things have been slandered because of what he did
                            Yeah I agree. There's never been a slander campaign like the one after WWII. History will be written by the victors.
                    Maybe fighting in the war fucked his head up 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
                        After listening to the absolute horrors of that war I'm inclined to agree. And there can be no doubt that the terms the French and English forced on the Germans paved the way to Hitler taking power.
                    He wasn't even that bad with the military problems as a leader. He was heavily involved with the planning and execution of the invasions of Poland and France, and some of his suggestions for those plans turned out to be highly successful. His failures as a military leader can pretty much all be chalked up to British intelligence being really good at its job or Hitler's inner circle being filled with sycophants giving him inaccurate reports. 
                Most of Hitler's great militaristic achievements never occurred, they were mainly made up by the Nazi regime during their reign. It was done to glorify Hitler and portray him as this strong militia who fought heroicly against the enemies
                    As far as I know no one has been able to convincingly discount the military honours he very clearly had since before anyone thought anything of him politically
            "You know what we usually say? Well just shoot _that_ one."
            Being a message runner could mean running through some pretty dangerous conditions under bombardment and gas attack and etc. though. It wasn't like he got a safe job. I mean he was injured and hospitalized twice in the war, once when a shell hit his dugout, and another from a gas attack.
            You say that as if it was some lowly position.   Runners had stones and that was recognized.  
        On October 14, 1918, Hitler himself got wounded by gas.
            Its why he never resorted to using it against enemy combatants. 
                Yup! Just some Jews, but who cares about them right guys!
        Yeah but then maybe Rommel or Goebbels would have risen to power, and they weren't as insane and stupid as Hitler was, they might have actually made the war last longer

idk, i heard he made some terrible art
    It was decent
[Did you know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRPEsRp3utc) that the Germans were not prone to using gas weapons in WWII because of Hitlers experience and injuries suffered from them during WWI while he served in the German military.
    I think it could be argued that gas weapons of the time would not have been nearly as useful in WW2. They were a hassle to use even in WW1 with static positions on both sides. Considering the nature of WW2, if people thought that gas was a war-winner, you can be sure they'd use it.

Dang, that's a good joke. I didn't get it before the edit.
Even if one thought that Hitler did nothing *morally* wrong, I think everybody can agree that he did things wrong *strategically*
Didn't Hitler still fight for the Germans in WW1 though?
    Nobody was right in WW1, people fought for their homelands.  Even Anne Franks' father was a soldier for the German army.

He experienced it and was afraid it would be used against his own troops, IIRC. Obviously the Jews were a different subject for him.
With the amount of civilian bombing in WW2 on both sides, adding gas would of been terrifying.

But typing on console is ridiculous and by the time you could type a sentence you'd be dead.
    They could make better/customizable presets for chat, like in rocket league. Wow!
        Yeah. I play a lot of overwatch and I wish for that too. The presets they have are useful but sometimes you just need to be able to say "go healer" "why are you two the same hero?!?!" "Why is our team all stack  heroes we're defending!"
            Hanzo is totally a healer, he just prevents the damage from happening in the first place.

            Right number in bf1
        They should at least add a quick button for "Thanks" on pc. 

so many times when I see a medic coming all the way from 20 meters to revive me and it's just a hustle to use that chat wheel to say Thanks  in the middle of combat. I can't count the times I died while trying to wheel chat to say thanks and get killed again :/

Overwatch has a single button for saying Thanks iirc, 1 click and it says thanks. 
        We have Go Go Go, but I need Go left, Go right, stop.
        Or release a chatpad for the controller like the 360. 
        Apex has a very simple and effective communication system also. Don't know why there are some things all games just dont adopt.
    I don't disagree with that. What i'm getting at is more that it would be helpful to be able to voice chat with the whole team and not just your squad. 
        Oh yeah. I misunderstood your comment.
    No you just face the wall and no one attacks you. It's law 
    We're talking about BF1, you're dead anyway. 
And the ones that do are playing shitty rap music in the mic
I had to turn VOIP off on console. Too much distracting chatter and random noises. Probably the environment the Console player is in. Whereas with PC at least they're predominantly in an isolated area of the house (apologies for the generalisation). 
    That makes sense. Consoles are generally in a living room where the family gathers, where as a lot of people will have a dedicated computer room or area. 
Also now with party chat via psn even if a couple people are mic'd up they are probably chatting in party chat. On ps3 I made a lot of gaming friends by just getting into a game where a couple of them were already friends and chatting. Usually people were stoked to find someone else with a mic on. Now (at least in my experience) we all talk in a party outside the game.
Had a similar experience in BF1 but with my Finnish friend. His rant inspired me to start learning that beautiful language lol.
    [This will get you far](http://i.imgur.com/2vhgoGN.png) 
        Wait that phrase means all those things?
            Ofcourse! It would be a shame to waste such a good phrase, so instead of using it once, we can use it multiple times! But don't worry, [finnish language is very well organized](http://i.imgur.com/0bMxF0R.jpg) 
I play BF with a German dude that I found in a match, now he's an important member of our squad.  Sadly he stays calm and collected most of the time so I don't get to hear any glorious tirades such as you experienced. 
I loved whispering things to people right before assassinating them. Halo 2 really was the best.

Check out Dan Carlin's hardcore history about WWI. Fucking. Insane.
    also https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGreatWar
    And actually, *any* of the references Carlin frequently cites, particularly Peter Hart and his books about the BEF and Passchendaele are amazing. Even general [Erich von Falkenhayn](https://archive.org/details/germangeneralsta00falk) himself has some unique insight.
At the 2nd Battle of Ypres the Germans just let loose a ton of gas downwind at the French troops and completely pushed them out. The Germans didn't expect it to succeed so well and didn't have a push planned, so no real territory changed hands. After Ypres troops were better prepared for gas attacks as seen by Canadian troops taking high ground and holding their ground in future attacks.
No, of course, but it is known that the German Kaiser Wilhelm was a firm criticizer of the rules of war. He is famous for saying that the concordats and declarations were just "pieces of paper". You could expect that from a man whose first act of war was attacking a neutral country
    The initial goal wasn't so much to attack Belgium so much as march through it on their way to France, but the Belgians had other plans and delayed the Germans long enough for the Brits and French to prepare themselves and send help
        [deleted]
            Dan Carlin taught me that.
                I didn't even see your comment, and Dan Carlin popped into my head (Quote: yadda-yadda-yadda.  End Quote.)

Man, if Dan Carlin was a History Teacher or professor, his classes would be full.
                He taught me that....agin and agin and agin and agin.

I'lll never hear the word again the same, I'll always think of the way he says it.
                Keith Heading told me that joke!
            Firstly, internally the Holocaust was considered self defense by the Nazis. That doesn't make it any better in the slightest. 

Secondly, at what point do you stop considering it self defense? What the Germans did would be equivalent to me attacking four of my neighbors because I assume that they're going to attack me at some point in the future. 

Thirdly, was it really even seen as self defense internally? The Germans had been planning for a war in which they would occupy a plurality of mainland Europe since Germany was an independent state. That sounds less like self defense, and more like premeditated murder.
            Schlieffen Plan Best Plan
        Yeah, the Germans weren't so bad. They just wanted to intimidate a neutral country so they could march their army through it, to attack another neutral country. 
            I'm not trying to defend the German logic, what they did to Belgium in WW1 is some absolutely awful stuff...also France was in no way neutral at that point...when Germany declared war on Russia after Russia first declared war on Austria-Hungary for invading Russia-supported Serbia, France and England both declared war on Germany a whole two weeks before Germany enacted their plan
                

1. What do you mean "France was in now way neutral at that point"? One of the reasons the Schlieffen Plan failed was because the French were hesitant to mobilize, and at the Skirmish at Joncherey the French moved their troops 10 km from their own border in order to show the Germans they did not want war.

2. Austria-Hungary was the one to declare war on Russia, not the other way around, and at that point Germany had already declared war on Russia (Germany was the one to declare war).

3. War was not declared between Austria-Hungary and Russia until August 6, 1914. Three days after Germany had declared war on France, two days after Germany had invaded Belgium, and four days after Germany had invaded Luxembourg. I have no idea what you mean by "France and England both declared war on Germany a whole two weeks before Germany enacted their plan"
Would you like a lesson, sir, in the rules of war? Or perhaps your children would?
There were documents of international rights and practice of war that existed before the Geneva convention. That was written in 1907 and WWI was 1914-1918. 
    Actually the first Geneva Convention was held in the 1800s, but it doesnt change the fact that OPs post is specifically talking about the Geneva Convention (of 1926) which banned gas in war, so other written rules of war are, as I said, irrelevant.  
        The OPs post is about the legality of gas attacks during warfare, which is why he posted the prior precedent.  Relevant and informative.
            You may wanna reread his post then.
                Can't understand why you are downvoted.
                    Because people are dumb. Simple as that, and nothing can be done about it.
                The OP in this context is the person who started this comment chain.
                    But that's the person I'm saying posted an irrelevant.... fuck it I'm done.
                        Ok then. The guy posted something that shows using poisons in warfare was prohibited before WW1 started. In the picture posted by OP someone says that's it's ok to use gas because the Geneva Convention hasn't been written yet, therefore it is relevant.
            That's only partly true. OPs post is specifically about the Geneva convention.
        You really struggle at reading comprehension, social awareness and basic context, don't you?
For everybody fighting here; both are correct.

Yes, gas was against the rules of war as per the Hague Convention. BUT tha dood is also correct that the Convention in question was specifically the Geneva Convention, which had not yet taken place. So while they may be pedantic, they are still correct. 

Everybody is correct. Nobody fucking cares, it's all a joke.
But they didn't violate the convention rules as it bans gas projectiles. The first time gas was used the Germans simply opened containers of chlorine gas while the wind was at their backs. 
    Nice comment. Read that anywhere? ;)
        Ah, looked at your post history and it seems you're insinuating I read your reply and then typed mine. But if you look at the times, I posted my reply 2 hours *before* yours. Good try.
            Wow that's actually really strange that we both used almost identical wording. 

Maybe it's one of those things where I read yours and subconsciously typed it thinking it was my own original thought.

Regardless, I was just fucking with you. Couldn't care less whether or not someone used my comment on reddit. 
        ? Do you want sources? I know this from my knowledge of WWI history. First learned about it I think when I was listening to Dan Carlin's hardcore history podcast, I think episode 2 or 3 of blueprint for Armageddon.
Ya but it was Germans who banned use of them meaning German soldiers aren't aloud to use them but Americans didn't ban them so they were aloud to use well the Germans were not 
    Why did the germans ban use of them?
        To op
            Lol
        I think it was because they caused internal bleeding/wounds that were hard to treat and caused many deaths so Germany called them inhuman and tried to get them bannned

Gas hardly ever kills anyone, just annoys and forces both sides into an endless stalemate of SMG's and shotguns
    i dunno if you used it, gas actually kills a whole lot of people, and even when it doesn't it can still be used tactically.

tl;dr you're a scrub
        Tactically? Yeah like forcing your teammates to have terrible suppression effects for 15+ seconds when you guys spam it everywhere? Amazing tactics, good job.

It's extra surreal when you're on a European server and you get actual irl Germans from 2017, on the virtual German team from 1917, raving about Jewish socialism raping German culture and destroying the continent. 
    Now this was something I did not expect to read
I think 99% of those people are just kidding around. I'm an extremely mild mannered person "in real life." But when I'm on battlefield 1 I don't know what happens to me. Something takes over and I have to teabag absolutely everyone and remind everyone that their mothers all blew me last night.  

It's cathartic. 
    I dunno man, they've all seemed pretty serious so far, there's a difference between excessive jokes and genuinely expressing an argument to deport everyone who isn't white 

Also I don't really buy the kidding around thing, still seems super immature and makes the game feel kinda toxic, if you get catharsis from acting like an 8 year old then there's something wrong with you

    All pilots have a standard issue sidearm for defense if they need to eject. It can also be used to hunt for food while waiting for rescue from remote areas. 
        I wouldn't really consider a double barreled shotgun a standard issue sidearm.
            It's also a video game. I'm talking more about in real life. 
                Yea I get too into these discussions.
            6 years but whatever

In real life, double barreled shotguns were used for SIS pilots due to the fact they could be used for hunting. Most had slugs and birdshot. This includes during ww1

Another cool fact is that in WW2, there was a German double barrel which also had a rifle attached that pilots used. The rifle commonly used soft point rounds which were illegal to shoot people with, but were fine against animals.
                That actually makes alot of sense, you learn something new everyday haha.
                    The More You Moe
  I feel like it is about pilots being valuable POWs. I don't know how to say it outside of chivallary. Personally I would say shoot them, because it is war. Especially if they just bombed a position. Pilots are expensive to train and use.

 You cannot hold back in a total war scenario. What if they get back to friendlies and fly again just to kill more of your side.

 I would hate myself for sure, but you have a gun and an expensive asset which is dangerous. If I had the skill to just shoot the parachute just enough to make them break their legs I would.
    I appreciate this response.
         Thanks. I would feel guilty if I ever did it especially prioritizing life as an asset, but pretty sure I would be enraged in full war if I saw the destruction on my friends or such by pilots while being a grunt or such, and wouldn't give two fucks.

 Pilots who hit the ground still are a danger. Do they not carry pistols?

 I don't know honestly. War sucks, period. Even these videos of Ukraine is just like hell, how many soldiers just died.

 Pilots shouldn't be immune to that. No difference in pushing a button as an asset or a grunt pulling a trigger. Short of cost. Feels bad man typing this.
This is the best, simply put point I had read in a while. Very well done.
Also don't use jet fuel to melt our steel beams.

    Or Arm Bears.  That shit gets out of hand real fast.
The thing is though America was not involved until the interception of the Zimmerman telegram and after a ton of US ships were sunk but gas was still being used before they joined
    The Germans initially used the gas, and the way they did it was by burying the cylinders into the ground and taking the lids off when the wind was to their backs. Their thought was that by doing it that way it wasn't a violation of The Hague convention. After a few grizzly uses of this, the brits and French said fuck it, and put it in their artillery rounds because fuck you, the Germans opened Pandora's box by using it first. 

Source - dan carlin's hardcore history
> don't sink boats we like

We didn't really care about the Lusitania, only 128 Americans died. You're statement still stands though, since the U.S.S. Maine started the Span-Am war.
    Newspapers started the Spanish-American War. 
        Hearst started the Spanish-American war*
            Hearst and Pulitzer
It was a *British* Vessel, Germany *did* say they were going to sink in months in advance, Germany *also* said it was because passenger vessels were carrying arms for Britain and uh... yeah it all turned out to be true.
    It had over 100 Americans on it and already a few Americans had died on other ships sank by the Germans. Still, fuck Britain for carrying arms on a passenger ship. It's like using a human shield.
I know you said among others.. but i like how you mentioned US but not Russia, as if it wasn't a way bigger player in the war...
George carlin once said "If you have brown people, we will bomb you!"
the hero we needed in 1916
Well it was still a war between signatory powers, even if the US wasn't one. Them not adopting it doesn't mean they aren't bound by it.
If you don't want your passenger boats sunk, don't fill them with munitions. 
Gas was used long before the US entered the war in April 1917.  The Battle of Ypres saw the first use of poison gas l, by Germany, in 1915.  

If anything the Hague Conferences were an effort by the ruling European parties to try and slow down the massive arms race that exploded at the turn of the century.  To the monarchs, especially Tsar Nicholas of Russia, the massive stockpiling and development of new arms posed a direct threat to their power in the long run.  This was especially true with Russia, who was farther behind in industrialization than its Western European counterparts.

Therefore, it could be argued that the agreements at the Hague Conferences were more of an attempt to "slow down" the arms race rather than stop it completely.  That would explain why many of the propositions at the Hague Conference either had a short expiration date or why some of the other more developed powers decided not to sign them.
    Interesting points, but you're like 3 months late haha
Or be aggro on Twitter.
    .
Not that u where needed to win the war. 
That doesn't sound very fun!
    I guess you had to be there.
I'm imagining them opening up cans with one hand pinching their nose like it's that Tupperware you left in the refrigerator for far too long.
    Pretty much, only relying on wind direction not to blow it back in your face and gas masks with very limited effectiveness instead of pinching their nose.
        Yeah I remembered they time they did that and the wind changed and they killed their own first wave of troops. 
            I believe that was the first British use.  When the Germans first used chlorine gas (they had already attempted to use "tear gas" on the russians)  they devastated the French colonial troops impacted. It's believed that if they had actually pushed the gap instead of using it as a test they could have opened up the lines. 
                The French were the first to use gas, but it was tear gas. Germany used lethal gas first. 
    What do you think they're barbarians? Of course they used clothespins instead of their fingers; they had the technology.
    There were instances where the gas they released did blow back into their own lines.
    Probably in the beginning it was similar to that haha! They had to time it with the wind direction (which was typically blowing towards the German lines).
        Why didn't they shoot it then behind enemy lines
            From the Hague Convention of 1899

>This declaration states that, in any war between signatory powers, the parties will abstain from using **projectiles** "the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases." Ratified by all major powers, except the United States.
    PROTIP: Baked beans work great as a mold starter. 
    Put it in the freezer, then take it out for a bit and open it inside a bin bag
Both sides did, IIRC the British were the first to use them 
    The Germans were the first to use gas. They attempted it against the Russians early in the war, but it was too cold. Later they caused a massive gas cloud at Ypres that was the first successful gassing of the war.
        Operation Disinfection
        Sorry, I thought we were referring to the first to use real projectiles 
            Depends on your definition of projectiles, but in both instances I believe they were fired as artillery shells that released gas on impact.
                At Bolimów I think so, not at Ypres though. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres):
>German troops carried 5,730 gas cylinders, weighing 90 pounds (41 kg) each, to the front by hand. The cylinders, opened by hand, relied on the prevailing wind to carry the gas towards enemy lines. Because of this method of dispersal, a large number of German soldiers were injured or killed while carrying out the attack.
                    Not at the Battle of Ypres, but near Ypres at Langemark according to Wikipedia. Also that's weird, the Wikipedia article and book I'm reading said that Bolimow was an artillery shelling that was ineffective because the it was so cold that the gas froze.
        Not the last time the Germans succeeded in using gas.
Also, couldn't they have argued there was a purpose for like shrapnel or something? Making it no longer the sole purpose?
wind and hope it goes towards enemy
They were. At Ypres, the first successful gassing, they were fired from artillery. The canisters hit the ground and excreted the gas, which is heavier than air so it sank into the trenches.
Yep. First people to encounter it were Algerian and Canadian troops. Didn't even move, they didn't know what it was. Terrible way to die.

            Also gonna add that we were in both world wars before the United States since we still had strong ties to Britain
            back in early 2000's afghabistan photos were leaked showing Canadian special forces dragging prisoners of war into base after a series of highly successful raids. the Canadian DOD (or whatever it's called) was able to cover up their involvement for years by saying they were American troops. 
            Check out the battle of Beaumont Hamel and the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. An entire colonies army wiped out in less than 10 minutes.
            Visited Amiens this summer, right before the centennial for the battle of the Somme, and the Canadians had a very nice memorial/ museum, and it's one of the only places where you can walk through original trenches. I think it was the spot where the Newfoundland regiment earned their"Royal" status as they fought like crazy and lost an enormous amount of their forces.
            My great grandfather was a canadian soldier in WW1. Took an MG burst to the arm and lost the whole thing.

        Yes I am aware of all this, though you must keep in mind the Canadians would have been completely routed had the German high command known how effective the gas attacks would've been. It was supposed to be just a test to see how the gas would work, no one was expecting for it to decimate enemy lines. That's not to take away from the incredible bravery and courage of the Canadians, but the German failure can be really pinned on the high command for not planning for a full attack after the gas attacks, or at least saving the gas for a true offensive. 
        Surely the guy had to have had some formal education in sciences? How else does one "realize" that pissing on a cloth and breathing through it lets you survive the gas?

                I just imagine him thinking, "what would  better than breathing this?? Gotta stick my head in the latrine! Oh wow my morning piss actually is helping! 'Guys! Breath your piss!'" 

Then the explanation was added later.
            They have these short clips they play on CBC showing epic historical moments in Canadian history and there was one about this. I think he was a chemistry teacher or something. 
Yeah that's why you don't start fights you can't finish...*Japan*. 
He fought in WWI, little older than a kid. 

People would joke years later about how they had the opportunity to shoot Hitler in WWI but didn't. If they only knew. 

I forget exactly who it was Hitler met with, but they shared war stories and found out they were at the same place,  at the same time on opposing fronts. They were in trenches 70 yards across from each other. That's when they would joke with the person and say how he had the chance to shoot him, haha. 
    Wasn't he like a message runner though? 
        He had an iron cross first class which were not given out lightly
            Say what you want about Hitler but he was a fanatical soilder. He put his life on the line multiple times and I think at one point took 5 French soldiers prisoners by him self. He was a very good ground solider. Luckily I suppose that doesn't translate into a good person.... I would say leader but he was arguably a good leader.... just sucked at the human rights shit and military problems.
                Most of his stories are proven fabricated. The capture of the French soldiers being the most notable. 
                    Oh shit.... Is that true? 

Now I need to go read up on that.... If that is the case then my bad. Its really hard to tell with Hitler because so many things have been slandered because of what he did
                        Yeah I agree. There's never been a slander campaign like the one after WWII. History will be written by the victors.
                Maybe fighting in the war fucked his head up 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
                    After listening to the absolute horrors of that war I'm inclined to agree. And there can be no doubt that the terms the French and English forced on the Germans paved the way to Hitler taking power.
                He wasn't even that bad with the military problems as a leader. He was heavily involved with the planning and execution of the invasions of Poland and France, and some of his suggestions for those plans turned out to be highly successful. His failures as a military leader can pretty much all be chalked up to British intelligence being really good at its job or Hitler's inner circle being filled with sycophants giving him inaccurate reports. 
            Most of Hitler's great militaristic achievements never occurred, they were mainly made up by the Nazi regime during their reign. It was done to glorify Hitler and portray him as this strong militia who fought heroicly against the enemies
                As far as I know no one has been able to convincingly discount the military honours he very clearly had since before anyone thought anything of him politically
        "You know what we usually say? Well just shoot _that_ one."
        Being a message runner could mean running through some pretty dangerous conditions under bombardment and gas attack and etc. though. It wasn't like he got a safe job. I mean he was injured and hospitalized twice in the war, once when a shell hit his dugout, and another from a gas attack.
        You say that as if it was some lowly position.   Runners had stones and that was recognized.  
    On October 14, 1918, Hitler himself got wounded by gas.
        Its why he never resorted to using it against enemy combatants. 
            Yup! Just some Jews, but who cares about them right guys!
    Yeah but then maybe Rommel or Goebbels would have risen to power, and they weren't as insane and stupid as Hitler was, they might have actually made the war last longer

It was decent
I think it could be argued that gas weapons of the time would not have been nearly as useful in WW2. They were a hassle to use even in WW1 with static positions on both sides. Considering the nature of WW2, if people thought that gas was a war-winner, you can be sure they'd use it.
Oh thanks, I really thought he is dead serious haha
    When I commented he had a score of -3, just trying to help.
Nobody was right in WW1, people fought for their homelands.  Even Anne Franks' father was a soldier for the German army.
    WW1 is not the black and what good vs evil war that WW2 was.

    They should at least add a quick button for "Thanks" on pc. 

so many times when I see a medic coming all the way from 20 meters to revive me and it's just a hustle to use that chat wheel to say Thanks  in the middle of combat. I can't count the times I died while trying to wheel chat to say thanks and get killed again :/

Overwatch has a single button for saying Thanks iirc, 1 click and it says thanks. 
    We have Go Go Go, but I need Go left, Go right, stop.
    Or release a chatpad for the controller like the 360. 
    Apex has a very simple and effective communication system also. Don't know why there are some things all games just dont adopt.
I don't disagree with that. What i'm getting at is more that it would be helpful to be able to voice chat with the whole team and not just your squad. 
    Oh yeah. I misunderstood your comment.
No you just face the wall and no one attacks you. It's law

And actually, *any* of the references Carlin frequently cites, particularly Peter Hart and his books about the BEF and Passchendaele are amazing. Even general [Erich von Falkenhayn](https://archive.org/details/germangeneralsta00falk) himself has some unique insight.
The initial goal wasn't so much to attack Belgium so much as march through it on their way to France, but the Belgians had other plans and delayed the Germans long enough for the Brits and French to prepare themselves and send help
    [deleted]
        Dan Carlin taught me that.
            I didn't even see your comment, and Dan Carlin popped into my head (Quote: yadda-yadda-yadda.  End Quote.)

Man, if Dan Carlin was a History Teacher or professor, his classes would be full.
            He taught me that....agin and agin and agin and agin.

I'lll never hear the word again the same, I'll always think of the way he says it.
            Keith Heading told me that joke!
        Firstly, internally the Holocaust was considered self defense by the Nazis. That doesn't make it any better in the slightest. 

Secondly, at what point do you stop considering it self defense? What the Germans did would be equivalent to me attacking four of my neighbors because I assume that they're going to attack me at some point in the future. 

Thirdly, was it really even seen as self defense internally? The Germans had been planning for a war in which they would occupy a plurality of mainland Europe since Germany was an independent state. That sounds less like self defense, and more like premeditated murder.
        Schlieffen Plan Best Plan
    Yeah, the Germans weren't so bad. They just wanted to intimidate a neutral country so they could march their army through it, to attack another neutral country. 
        I'm not trying to defend the German logic, what they did to Belgium in WW1 is some absolutely awful stuff...also France was in no way neutral at that point...when Germany declared war on Russia after Russia first declared war on Austria-Hungary for invading Russia-supported Serbia, France and England both declared war on Germany a whole two weeks before Germany enacted their plan
            

1. What do you mean "France was in now way neutral at that point"? One of the reasons the Schlieffen Plan failed was because the French were hesitant to mobilize, and at the Skirmish at Joncherey the French moved their troops 10 km from their own border in order to show the Germans they did not want war.

2. Austria-Hungary was the one to declare war on Russia, not the other way around, and at that point Germany had already declared war on Russia (Germany was the one to declare war).

3. War was not declared between Austria-Hungary and Russia until August 6, 1914. Three days after Germany had declared war on France, two days after Germany had invaded Belgium, and four days after Germany had invaded Luxembourg. I have no idea what you mean by "France and England both declared war on Germany a whole two weeks before Germany enacted their plan"
Actually the first Geneva Convention was held in the 1800s, but it doesnt change the fact that OPs post is specifically talking about the Geneva Convention (of 1926) which banned gas in war, so other written rules of war are, as I said, irrelevant.  
    The OPs post is about the legality of gas attacks during warfare, which is why he posted the prior precedent.  Relevant and informative.
        You may wanna reread his post then.
            Can't understand why you are downvoted.
                Because people are dumb. Simple as that, and nothing can be done about it.
            The OP in this context is the person who started this comment chain.
                But that's the person I'm saying posted an irrelevant.... fuck it I'm done.
                    Ok then. The guy posted something that shows using poisons in warfare was prohibited before WW1 started. In the picture posted by OP someone says that's it's ok to use gas because the Geneva Convention hasn't been written yet, therefore it is relevant.
        That's only partly true. OPs post is specifically about the Geneva convention.
    You really struggle at reading comprehension, social awareness and basic context, don't you?
Nice comment. Read that anywhere? ;)
    Ah, looked at your post history and it seems you're insinuating I read your reply and then typed mine. But if you look at the times, I posted my reply 2 hours *before* yours. Good try.
        Wow that's actually really strange that we both used almost identical wording. 

Maybe it's one of those things where I read yours and subconsciously typed it thinking it was my own original thought.

Regardless, I was just fucking with you. Couldn't care less whether or not someone used my comment on reddit. 
    ? Do you want sources? I know this from my knowledge of WWI history. First learned about it I think when I was listening to Dan Carlin's hardcore history podcast, I think episode 2 or 3 of blueprint for Armageddon.
Why did the germans ban use of them?
    To op
        Lol
    I think it was because they caused internal bleeding/wounds that were hard to treat and caused many deaths so Germany called them inhuman and tried to get them bannned
        Oh, thanks

        Just realized I misread your post, I thought you were complaining people were role playing, my bad! 
Have a nice day 
i dunno if you used it, gas actually kills a whole lot of people, and even when it doesn't it can still be used tactically.

tl;dr you're a scrub
    Tactically? Yeah like forcing your teammates to have terrible suppression effects for 15+ seconds when you guys spam it everywhere? Amazing tactics, good job.
That's because you're essentially anonymous when playing video games.

Jocks play video games
Yeah. The White Supremacists never play as the Soviets, and I'm sure everyone can guess why.
Now this was something I did not expect to read
I dunno man, they've all seemed pretty serious so far, there's a difference between excessive jokes and genuinely expressing an argument to deport everyone who isn't white 

Also I don't really buy the kidding around thing, still seems super immature and makes the game feel kinda toxic, if you get catharsis from acting like an 8 year old then there's something wrong with you 
You're my spirit animal mane 
All pilots have a standard issue sidearm for defense if they need to eject. It can also be used to hunt for food while waiting for rescue from remote areas. 
    I wouldn't really consider a double barreled shotgun a standard issue sidearm.
        It's also a video game. I'm talking more about in real life. 
            Yea I get too into these discussions.
        6 years but whatever

In real life, double barreled shotguns were used for SIS pilots due to the fact they could be used for hunting. Most had slugs and birdshot. This includes during ww1

Another cool fact is that in WW2, there was a German double barrel which also had a rifle attached that pilots used. The rifle commonly used soft point rounds which were illegal to shoot people with, but were fine against animals.
            That actually makes alot of sense, you learn something new everyday haha.
                The More You Moe
I appreciate this response.
     Thanks. I would feel guilty if I ever did it especially prioritizing life as an asset, but pretty sure I would be enraged in full war if I saw the destruction on my friends or such by pilots while being a grunt or such, and wouldn't give two fucks.

 Pilots who hit the ground still are a danger. Do they not carry pistols?

 I don't know honestly. War sucks, period. Even these videos of Ukraine is just like hell, how many soldiers just died.

 Pilots shouldn't be immune to that. No difference in pushing a button as an asset or a grunt pulling a trigger. Short of cost. Feels bad man typing this.

The Germans initially used the gas, and the way they did it was by burying the cylinders into the ground and taking the lids off when the wind was to their backs. Their thought was that by doing it that way it wasn't a violation of The Hague convention. After a few grizzly uses of this, the brits and French said fuck it, and put it in their artillery rounds because fuck you, the Germans opened Pandora's box by using it first.

Newspapers started the Spanish-American War. 
    Hearst started the Spanish-American war*
        Hearst and Pulitzer
It had over 100 Americans on it and already a few Americans had died on other ships sank by the Germans. Still, fuck Britain for carrying arms on a passenger ship. It's like using a human shield.
Interesting points, but you're like 3 months late haha
.
I guess you had to be there.
Pretty much, only relying on wind direction not to blow it back in your face and gas masks with very limited effectiveness instead of pinching their nose.
    Yeah I remembered they time they did that and the wind changed and they killed their own first wave of troops. 
        I believe that was the first British use.  When the Germans first used chlorine gas (they had already attempted to use "tear gas" on the russians)  they devastated the French colonial troops impacted. It's believed that if they had actually pushed the gap instead of using it as a test they could have opened up the lines. 
            The French were the first to use gas, but it was tear gas. Germany used lethal gas first. 
What do you think they're barbarians? Of course they used clothespins instead of their fingers; they had the technology.
There were instances where the gas they released did blow back into their own lines.
Probably in the beginning it was similar to that haha! They had to time it with the wind direction (which was typically blowing towards the German lines).
    Why didn't they shoot it then behind enemy lines
        From the Hague Convention of 1899

>This declaration states that, in any war between signatory powers, the parties will abstain from using **projectiles** "the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases." Ratified by all major powers, except the United States.
PROTIP: Baked beans work great as a mold starter. 
Put it in the freezer, then take it out for a bit and open it inside a bin bag
The Germans were the first to use gas. They attempted it against the Russians early in the war, but it was too cold. Later they caused a massive gas cloud at Ypres that was the first successful gassing of the war.
    Operation Disinfection
    Sorry, I thought we were referring to the first to use real projectiles 
        Depends on your definition of projectiles, but in both instances I believe they were fired as artillery shells that released gas on impact.
            At Bolimów I think so, not at Ypres though. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres):
>German troops carried 5,730 gas cylinders, weighing 90 pounds (41 kg) each, to the front by hand. The cylinders, opened by hand, relied on the prevailing wind to carry the gas towards enemy lines. Because of this method of dispersal, a large number of German soldiers were injured or killed while carrying out the attack.
                Not at the Battle of Ypres, but near Ypres at Langemark according to Wikipedia. Also that's weird, the Wikipedia article and book I'm reading said that Bolimow was an artillery shelling that was ineffective because the it was so cold that the gas froze.
    Not the last time the Germans succeeded in using gas.

Then the explanation was added later.
        They have these short clips they play on CBC showing epic historical moments in Canadian history and there was one about this. I think he was a chemistry teacher or something. 
Wasn't he like a message runner though? 
    He had an iron cross first class which were not given out lightly
        Say what you want about Hitler but he was a fanatical soilder. He put his life on the line multiple times and I think at one point took 5 French soldiers prisoners by him self. He was a very good ground solider. Luckily I suppose that doesn't translate into a good person.... I would say leader but he was arguably a good leader.... just sucked at the human rights shit and military problems.
            Most of his stories are proven fabricated. The capture of the French soldiers being the most notable. 
                Oh shit.... Is that true? 

Now I need to go read up on that.... If that is the case then my bad. Its really hard to tell with Hitler because so many things have been slandered because of what he did
                    Yeah I agree. There's never been a slander campaign like the one after WWII. History will be written by the victors.
            Maybe fighting in the war fucked his head up 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
                After listening to the absolute horrors of that war I'm inclined to agree. And there can be no doubt that the terms the French and English forced on the Germans paved the way to Hitler taking power.
            He wasn't even that bad with the military problems as a leader. He was heavily involved with the planning and execution of the invasions of Poland and France, and some of his suggestions for those plans turned out to be highly successful. His failures as a military leader can pretty much all be chalked up to British intelligence being really good at its job or Hitler's inner circle being filled with sycophants giving him inaccurate reports. 
        Most of Hitler's great militaristic achievements never occurred, they were mainly made up by the Nazi regime during their reign. It was done to glorify Hitler and portray him as this strong militia who fought heroicly against the enemies
            As far as I know no one has been able to convincingly discount the military honours he very clearly had since before anyone thought anything of him politically
    "You know what we usually say? Well just shoot _that_ one."
    Being a message runner could mean running through some pretty dangerous conditions under bombardment and gas attack and etc. though. It wasn't like he got a safe job. I mean he was injured and hospitalized twice in the war, once when a shell hit his dugout, and another from a gas attack.
    You say that as if it was some lowly position.   Runners had stones and that was recognized.  
On October 14, 1918, Hitler himself got wounded by gas.
    Its why he never resorted to using it against enemy combatants. 
        Yup! Just some Jews, but who cares about them right guys!
Yeah but then maybe Rommel or Goebbels would have risen to power, and they weren't as insane and stupid as Hitler was, they might have actually made the war last longer

They should at least add a quick button for "Thanks" on pc. 

so many times when I see a medic coming all the way from 20 meters to revive me and it's just a hustle to use that chat wheel to say Thanks  in the middle of combat. I can't count the times I died while trying to wheel chat to say thanks and get killed again :/

Overwatch has a single button for saying Thanks iirc, 1 click and it says thanks. 
We have Go Go Go, but I need Go left, Go right, stop.
Or release a chatpad for the controller like the 360. 
Apex has a very simple and effective communication system also. Don't know why there are some things all games just dont adopt.
Oh yeah. I misunderstood your comment.
Wait that phrase means all those things?
    Ofcourse! It would be a shame to waste such a good phrase, so instead of using it once, we can use it multiple times! But don't worry, [finnish language is very well organized](http://i.imgur.com/0bMxF0R.jpg)

    Dan Carlin taught me that.
        I didn't even see your comment, and Dan Carlin popped into my head (Quote: yadda-yadda-yadda.  End Quote.)

Man, if Dan Carlin was a History Teacher or professor, his classes would be full.
        He taught me that....agin and agin and agin and agin.

I'lll never hear the word again the same, I'll always think of the way he says it.
        Keith Heading told me that joke!
    Firstly, internally the Holocaust was considered self defense by the Nazis. That doesn't make it any better in the slightest. 

Secondly, at what point do you stop considering it self defense? What the Germans did would be equivalent to me attacking four of my neighbors because I assume that they're going to attack me at some point in the future. 

Thirdly, was it really even seen as self defense internally? The Germans had been planning for a war in which they would occupy a plurality of mainland Europe since Germany was an independent state. That sounds less like self defense, and more like premeditated murder.
    Schlieffen Plan Best Plan
Yeah, the Germans weren't so bad. They just wanted to intimidate a neutral country so they could march their army through it, to attack another neutral country. 
    I'm not trying to defend the German logic, what they did to Belgium in WW1 is some absolutely awful stuff...also France was in no way neutral at that point...when Germany declared war on Russia after Russia first declared war on Austria-Hungary for invading Russia-supported Serbia, France and England both declared war on Germany a whole two weeks before Germany enacted their plan
        

1. What do you mean "France was in now way neutral at that point"? One of the reasons the Schlieffen Plan failed was because the French were hesitant to mobilize, and at the Skirmish at Joncherey the French moved their troops 10 km from their own border in order to show the Germans they did not want war.

2. Austria-Hungary was the one to declare war on Russia, not the other way around, and at that point Germany had already declared war on Russia (Germany was the one to declare war).

3. War was not declared between Austria-Hungary and Russia until August 6, 1914. Three days after Germany had declared war on France, two days after Germany had invaded Belgium, and four days after Germany had invaded Luxembourg. I have no idea what you mean by "France and England both declared war on Germany a whole two weeks before Germany enacted their plan"
The OPs post is about the legality of gas attacks during warfare, which is why he posted the prior precedent.  Relevant and informative.
    You may wanna reread his post then.
        Can't understand why you are downvoted.
            Because people are dumb. Simple as that, and nothing can be done about it.
        The OP in this context is the person who started this comment chain.
            But that's the person I'm saying posted an irrelevant.... fuck it I'm done.
                Ok then. The guy posted something that shows using poisons in warfare was prohibited before WW1 started. In the picture posted by OP someone says that's it's ok to use gas because the Geneva Convention hasn't been written yet, therefore it is relevant.
    That's only partly true. OPs post is specifically about the Geneva convention.
You really struggle at reading comprehension, social awareness and basic context, don't you?
Ah, looked at your post history and it seems you're insinuating I read your reply and then typed mine. But if you look at the times, I posted my reply 2 hours *before* yours. Good try.
    Wow that's actually really strange that we both used almost identical wording. 

Maybe it's one of those things where I read yours and subconsciously typed it thinking it was my own original thought.

Regardless, I was just fucking with you. Couldn't care less whether or not someone used my comment on reddit. 
? Do you want sources? I know this from my knowledge of WWI history. First learned about it I think when I was listening to Dan Carlin's hardcore history podcast, I think episode 2 or 3 of blueprint for Armageddon.
To op
    Lol
I think it was because they caused internal bleeding/wounds that were hard to treat and caused many deaths so Germany called them inhuman and tried to get them bannned

I wouldn't really consider a double barreled shotgun a standard issue sidearm.
    It's also a video game. I'm talking more about in real life. 
        Yea I get too into these discussions.
    6 years but whatever

In real life, double barreled shotguns were used for SIS pilots due to the fact they could be used for hunting. Most had slugs and birdshot. This includes during ww1

Another cool fact is that in WW2, there was a German double barrel which also had a rifle attached that pilots used. The rifle commonly used soft point rounds which were illegal to shoot people with, but were fine against animals.
        That actually makes alot of sense, you learn something new everyday haha.
            The More You Moe
 Thanks. I would feel guilty if I ever did it especially prioritizing life as an asset, but pretty sure I would be enraged in full war if I saw the destruction on my friends or such by pilots while being a grunt or such, and wouldn't give two fucks.

 Pilots who hit the ground still are a danger. Do they not carry pistols?

 I don't know honestly. War sucks, period. Even these videos of Ukraine is just like hell, how many soldiers just died.

 Pilots shouldn't be immune to that. No difference in pushing a button as an asset or a grunt pulling a trigger. Short of cost. Feels bad man typing this.
Or bananas.

U think it's still about oil mate?
Hearst started the Spanish-American war*
    Hearst and Pulitzer
Yeah I remembered they time they did that and the wind changed and they killed their own first wave of troops. 
    I believe that was the first British use.  When the Germans first used chlorine gas (they had already attempted to use "tear gas" on the russians)  they devastated the French colonial troops impacted. It's believed that if they had actually pushed the gap instead of using it as a test they could have opened up the lines. 
        The French were the first to use gas, but it was tear gas. Germany used lethal gas first. 
Why didn't they shoot it then behind enemy lines
    From the Hague Convention of 1899

>This declaration states that, in any war between signatory powers, the parties will abstain from using **projectiles** "the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases." Ratified by all major powers, except the United States.
Operation Disinfection
Sorry, I thought we were referring to the first to use real projectiles 
    Depends on your definition of projectiles, but in both instances I believe they were fired as artillery shells that released gas on impact.
        At Bolimów I think so, not at Ypres though. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres):
>German troops carried 5,730 gas cylinders, weighing 90 pounds (41 kg) each, to the front by hand. The cylinders, opened by hand, relied on the prevailing wind to carry the gas towards enemy lines. Because of this method of dispersal, a large number of German soldiers were injured or killed while carrying out the attack.
            Not at the Battle of Ypres, but near Ypres at Langemark according to Wikipedia. Also that's weird, the Wikipedia article and book I'm reading said that Bolimow was an artillery shelling that was ineffective because the it was so cold that the gas froze.
Not the last time the Germans succeeded in using gas.
Canada's military doesn't get the respect it deserves.

        *Vimy
    Amen, you never hear about their beach invasions of Normandy either. Shame
        I suggest watching "Storming Juno", it covers the Canadian landings. Severely underappreciated movie.
            Thanks, I'll give that a view
            Never heard of it, thanks!
        Or how Canadian troops had the right to liberate Rome. Mark Clark disobeyed orders to flank the city and cut off the German retreat, instead he marched American troops through the city. 
    Also gonna add that we were in both world wars before the United States since we still had strong ties to Britain
    back in early 2000's afghabistan photos were leaked showing Canadian special forces dragging prisoners of war into base after a series of highly successful raids. the Canadian DOD (or whatever it's called) was able to cover up their involvement for years by saying they were American troops. 
    Check out the battle of Beaumont Hamel and the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. An entire colonies army wiped out in less than 10 minutes.
    Visited Amiens this summer, right before the centennial for the battle of the Somme, and the Canadians had a very nice memorial/ museum, and it's one of the only places where you can walk through original trenches. I think it was the spot where the Newfoundland regiment earned their"Royal" status as they fought like crazy and lost an enormous amount of their forces.
    My great grandfather was a canadian soldier in WW1. Took an MG burst to the arm and lost the whole thing.

That man was amazing.

Always used to say the best day of his life was the day they came out with Velcro laced shoes...
Yes I am aware of all this, though you must keep in mind the Canadians would have been completely routed had the German high command known how effective the gas attacks would've been. It was supposed to be just a test to see how the gas would work, no one was expecting for it to decimate enemy lines. That's not to take away from the incredible bravery and courage of the Canadians, but the German failure can be really pinned on the high command for not planning for a full attack after the gas attacks, or at least saving the gas for a true offensive. 
Surely the guy had to have had some formal education in sciences? How else does one "realize" that pissing on a cloth and breathing through it lets you survive the gas?

    Hey not sure if sarcasm on your part, but I'm pretty sure the guy above you is joking about the US's habit of messing with the governments of [Banana Republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic)
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Wars
            huh TIL. although the locations of these military actions also seem to coincide with banana republics, so I guess the terminology is related?

            Oh, interesting!
        I was serious, I didn't know about that, thanks!
    Wars for tea and opium too. 
    Yep. There was also one over a bucket. There are a lot of stupid wars. Such as the Emo Wars.
Paying us off first before you fuck us

I believe that was the first British use.  When the Germans first used chlorine gas (they had already attempted to use "tear gas" on the russians)  they devastated the French colonial troops impacted. It's believed that if they had actually pushed the gap instead of using it as a test they could have opened up the lines. 
    The French were the first to use gas, but it was tear gas. Germany used lethal gas first. 
From the Hague Convention of 1899

>This declaration states that, in any war between signatory powers, the parties will abstain from using **projectiles** "the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases." Ratified by all major powers, except the United States.
Depends on your definition of projectiles, but in both instances I believe they were fired as artillery shells that released gas on impact.
    At Bolimów I think so, not at Ypres though. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres):
>German troops carried 5,730 gas cylinders, weighing 90 pounds (41 kg) each, to the front by hand. The cylinders, opened by hand, relied on the prevailing wind to carry the gas towards enemy lines. Because of this method of dispersal, a large number of German soldiers were injured or killed while carrying out the attack.
        Not at the Battle of Ypres, but near Ypres at Langemark according to Wikipedia. Also that's weird, the Wikipedia article and book I'm reading said that Bolimow was an artillery shelling that was ineffective because the it was so cold that the gas froze.

Amen, you never hear about their beach invasions of Normandy either. Shame
    I suggest watching "Storming Juno", it covers the Canadian landings. Severely underappreciated movie.
        Thanks, I'll give that a view
        Never heard of it, thanks!
    Or how Canadian troops had the right to liberate Rome. Mark Clark disobeyed orders to flank the city and cut off the German retreat, instead he marched American troops through the city. 
Also gonna add that we were in both world wars before the United States since we still had strong ties to Britain
back in early 2000's afghabistan photos were leaked showing Canadian special forces dragging prisoners of war into base after a series of highly successful raids. the Canadian DOD (or whatever it's called) was able to cover up their involvement for years by saying they were American troops. 
Check out the battle of Beaumont Hamel and the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. An entire colonies army wiped out in less than 10 minutes.
Visited Amiens this summer, right before the centennial for the battle of the Somme, and the Canadians had a very nice memorial/ museum, and it's one of the only places where you can walk through original trenches. I think it was the spot where the Newfoundland regiment earned their"Royal" status as they fought like crazy and lost an enormous amount of their forces.
My great grandfather was a canadian soldier in WW1. Took an MG burst to the arm and lost the whole thing.

That man was amazing.

Always used to say the best day of his life was the day they came out with Velcro laced shoes...

    I just imagine him thinking, "what would  better than breathing this?? Gotta stick my head in the latrine! Oh wow my morning piss actually is helping! 'Guys! Breath your piss!'" 

Then the explanation was added later.
They have these short clips they play on CBC showing epic historical moments in Canadian history and there was one about this. I think he was a chemistry teacher or something. 
Say what you want about Hitler but he was a fanatical soilder. He put his life on the line multiple times and I think at one point took 5 French soldiers prisoners by him self. He was a very good ground solider. Luckily I suppose that doesn't translate into a good person.... I would say leader but he was arguably a good leader.... just sucked at the human rights shit and military problems.
    Most of his stories are proven fabricated. The capture of the French soldiers being the most notable. 
        Oh shit.... Is that true? 

Now I need to go read up on that.... If that is the case then my bad. Its really hard to tell with Hitler because so many things have been slandered because of what he did
            Yeah I agree. There's never been a slander campaign like the one after WWII. History will be written by the victors.
    Maybe fighting in the war fucked his head up 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
        After listening to the absolute horrors of that war I'm inclined to agree. And there can be no doubt that the terms the French and English forced on the Germans paved the way to Hitler taking power.
    He wasn't even that bad with the military problems as a leader. He was heavily involved with the planning and execution of the invasions of Poland and France, and some of his suggestions for those plans turned out to be highly successful. His failures as a military leader can pretty much all be chalked up to British intelligence being really good at its job or Hitler's inner circle being filled with sycophants giving him inaccurate reports. 
Most of Hitler's great militaristic achievements never occurred, they were mainly made up by the Nazi regime during their reign. It was done to glorify Hitler and portray him as this strong militia who fought heroicly against the enemies
    As far as I know no one has been able to convincingly discount the military honours he very clearly had since before anyone thought anything of him politically
Yup! Just some Jews, but who cares about them right guys!
Eh... Is it?
    Well the image overall is very funny.
While getting shot on the Western Front
    In complete silence since it was all quiet ^^^^/s
        On the Western Front, no one can hear you scream
His book may have helped
    You mean the one he released in 1925?
    He wrote that book while in prison for trying to overthrow the goddamn government a decade after ww1
        5 years are not a decade.

I didn't even see your comment, and Dan Carlin popped into my head (Quote: yadda-yadda-yadda.  End Quote.)

Man, if Dan Carlin was a History Teacher or professor, his classes would be full.
He taught me that....agin and agin and agin and agin.

I'lll never hear the word again the same, I'll always think of the way he says it.
Keith Heading told me that joke!


1. What do you mean "France was in now way neutral at that point"? One of the reasons the Schlieffen Plan failed was because the French were hesitant to mobilize, and at the Skirmish at Joncherey the French moved their troops 10 km from their own border in order to show the Germans they did not want war.

2. Austria-Hungary was the one to declare war on Russia, not the other way around, and at that point Germany had already declared war on Russia (Germany was the one to declare war).

3. War was not declared between Austria-Hungary and Russia until August 6, 1914. Three days after Germany had declared war on France, two days after Germany had invaded Belgium, and four days after Germany had invaded Luxembourg. I have no idea what you mean by "France and England both declared war on Germany a whole two weeks before Germany enacted their plan"
Can't understand why you are downvoted.
    Because people are dumb. Simple as that, and nothing can be done about it.
The OP in this context is the person who started this comment chain.
    But that's the person I'm saying posted an irrelevant.... fuck it I'm done.
        Ok then. The guy posted something that shows using poisons in warfare was prohibited before WW1 started. In the picture posted by OP someone says that's it's ok to use gas because the Geneva Convention hasn't been written yet, therefore it is relevant.
Yea I get too into these discussions.
That actually makes alot of sense, you learn something new everyday haha.
