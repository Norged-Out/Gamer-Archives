[[Quite possibly the smoothest behemoth escape I’ve seen]]





One can only speculate what would have happened if the plane had not rescued this brave soldier.
    A parachute would deploy from his arse like in all other BF games.
        Only if he was a pilot???
            We're all pilots on this blessed day.
                Speak for yourself.
                    I am all pilots on this blessed day!
                        Happy cake day ❤
                            22 days old, but thanks!
            I dont know why you have dislikes, regular soldiers dont have this
                All soldiers have parashutes.
                    Wow really? Bought the game a month after the release and never noticed. TIL
                        Parachutes only work when you are a certain amount of distance from the ground.
                            Are there any buildings or such tall enough in this one? I remember abusing the mechanic a lot more in previous games. 
                                I've never seen the prompt to open parachute when jumping from buildings. Honestly I thought they had removed it completely from base kit.

It's much better this way, earlier BF titles had practically no fall damage at all, it was stupid.
                                There now is a minimum distance you have to be from the ground to activate it. But I assume their are few buildings that are high enough.
                            This would happen if you keep turned on the option of the automatic parachute deployment. I've always turned off the option in every bf i played 
                                Yes but bf1 still has a minimum distance it is allowed to deploy unlike (or much higher than) bf4. I also have autodeploy disabled.
                    not in batllefield 1
                        Yes they do. Everyone has a parachute in BF1.

Have you literally never bailed from a Bomber to cap a flag before?
                            because only pilots have parachutes?
                                You and the five people upvoting you really need to jump in a BF1 match and bail from a plane.

**Everyone has a parachute.**
                                    try to jump from bridge or ledge on sinai
                                    afaik you only get the parachute if you enter a plane
                        they absolutely do; you can parachute from the cliffs of Sinai as infantry, cavalry, tanker, and you can do it again and again. Lack of big buildings is probably why people don't notice. Fall damage is also really inconsistent so I don't recommend using the parachute 
                        Yes they do. Stop spreading misinformation. https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/4x42et/quickie_do_all_classes_have_parachutes_or_just/
                Wow never knew people were this clueless to think that only pilots had parachutes
    SPECULATE, MOTHERFUCKER!
This is the definition of "only in Battlefield". Only thing missing is the Battlefield music after the clip ends.
    *Piano Jazz theme from BC1 plays*
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OriJfIlF8ag
            Just hearing this brings back so many great memories. Really hoping for a return to the BC1 style campaign again. 
                TBH I'd be quite happy with a re-release for PC since we never got it!
                Honestly best BF campaign hands down
                    That's a pretty low bar though (BC1 was still great, no question)
                Although you mentioned campaign specifically, BC1 was my popped cherry in the online multiplayer world. I'm truly keeping my fingers crossed for the BC3 rumors. A military fps (BC 1&2) with a lot of character in itself.
                Rumor has it the BF installment for 2019 will be BC3.  Unfortunately I missed BC1. 
            Awesome. Always wondered who actually recorded it
                [removed]
                    Llama 
            Thank you so much for this
            Aw. Now Sadstolgic.
            Goosebumps irl. Thanks.
            Man, the Bad Company games have such a unique feel. 
            Now can someone put them together?
            This brings back so many fond memories of the game even from the BC1 beta. Damn I miss that game
            Jesus, I've been looking for that song for years. 
        Omg the feels 
        Hah, "battlefield music" refers to the intro to 1942, not some BC bitch boi shit

            I know, I still like the BC music though.
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9iBJ7r315E 

Not my video but I thought it was a gross injustice to show the clip without music.

Honestly I don't even know why OP would have posted that garbage
        Have my upvote you lovely SOB. That theme still gives me chills.
        Excellent editing. Thanks for posting this. Only in Battlefield...
            Oh it's not mine. Someone posted the link in the comments somewhere so I just wanted more people to see it
        Unpopular opinion time:

I think BF3's edit of the theme is the best. 
        That was beautiful *tear*
        I think it's astonishing how well this fits together with another Battlefield theme:

http://www.youtubemultiplier.com/5a6a7e91de302-only-in-battlefield-one.php

(Maximize the left video!)

Works even better in my opinion
            Wow that worked amazing although the play button doesn't seem to work on mobile it only played one of the videos so I had to quickly tap em
        It’d be perfect if it was the BF1 version of the theme.
        Man this is so amazing.  
Also it makes me want BF2143 and Titan mode!!!!!!!
        That was amazing! 
        Thank you for this. I have beef with Gaming Bible ever since they shared a GTA clip I made and posted on reddit, but they credited some guy who reposted it and claimed it as his own. I messaged Gaming Bible on Facebook but heard nothing back.

And you’re right; it’s much better with the music!
        But that's the shit music, why not use the classic BF theme that actually fits the setting?
            If you can find one up to your standards then be my guest. It's just a fact that this is better than a muted 4:3 Instagram version
            https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/7sxlks/_/dt8zun8
        Also it's uncropped and unwatermarked without shitty intro/outro videos :) you're the man
    Ba dum dum dum dumdum! Ba dum dum dum dumdum!
    Bf2142 intro reborn baby
        1942*
        a NUMBER off my friend
    I know it's a deliberate marketing tagline, but holy shit stuff like this is literally "only in Battlefield", nothing else comes close
    That or the James Bond theme. 
    It's also a definition of progress in gaming industry. When I was a kid I had a blast playing this https://youtu.be/faJ0Jd5HaRg?t=239 , today it looks like some green and brown areas mixed together ...
        Red Baron is the game that made me want a WWI fps. BF1 made one of my childhood game wishes come true.
    I feel like the Indiana Jones theme would work best here, with the crescendo as he gets into the plane. 
    You mean the only thing missing is the terrible hip fire that completely misses everything
    I couldn't help but here the Indiana Jones tune
    More like the James Bond theme. 
    [deleted]
        I thought it was the actual escape with the music at the end. :(
    It’s amazing that no other game franchise has been able to replicate this sort of gameplay. 

From the outside this looks completely coordinated but in battlefield it could really be either one. 

Truly a great series 
    It’s ok I basically played that tune with escalation in my head as the video ended. 
    **SAIL!**
That's what it must be like to play with friends in your squad. LOL
    Nah. It's usually. "Dude where are you?" "Let's flank this guys...fuck he just went all rambo again." "Bro help me!" "Ha fuck you bro, good luck." That happens to me.
        I end up either in a Solo squad because they're all private or in a squad with the newbie who doesn't move the train an inch while using the howitzer.

I had to take a break from the game because though I don't mind playing MP solo it does wear on me.
            Well if you got a mic and play PS4 you can add me. I like meeting new people but im not always available since I work and study. Username is coconio. Let me know.
                I don't have the game for PS4 but thank you! It's tough finding reasonably chill people to play with on PC.
                How is it on PS4 these days? When I was playing about 6 months ago it was basically not possible to get into a non-empty operations match, and when you did it was a massive beat down.
                    I think that was due to a problem with DICE's matchmaking rather than player group size. I play on Xbone which has the smaller player base of all the systems and I can get into operations reasonably well still. 
                    It really depends. Also I play conquest more becuase I don't  have much time to play long matches.
        My squad goes full medics so it's a constant stream of people yelling "I NEED A SCOOP" "I GOT YOUR SCOOP".
    Add me "lilmoog" 
        Will do, I'm Darthriordan
Insert Indiana Jones Theme. And did that medic walk to his death?
    *EXPLOSIONS GETTING CLOSER*

SUPPORT: WE'RE TRAPPED, WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT

MEDIC: You go I'll hold them back

SUPPORT: ??!?!

MEDIC: GAWWAGAHAHHAAHAHAHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

    How do you NOT hear that as he's flying away?!
    I prefer the Pirates of the Caribbean theme
    Theme song played in my head as well, seems a perfect fit.
    That's exactly what I was thinking!
    I hum that song whenever things get really crazy in any game...or when I'm about to attempt something incredibly foolish.

        Ironic....
            He could save others from death, but not himself...
                Playing medic I have come to accept my self running into a room with teammates holding the respawn button while I am left alone and facing the waves of angry ottoman attackers.

Jumping into the fire was probably cathartic. 
                    When I was a Fire Marshall in the Navy their was a gas leak in a room below decks. (Basically a basement) Two men were stuck down there and I ran in without a breathing device to pull them out. Didn’t hesitate for a second. I only managed to pulled one guy out. Later my supervisor told me I was either brave or dumb for doing that. 

Here’s the thing, when they said leak I thought they meant water leak. So I ran in there thinking the room was flooding, not filling with murder vapors. 
                        Brotherman, keep that last part to yourself and accept the hero-ness. It is well deserved. 
                Never has a meme been more relevant 
            Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
                Its not a story DICE would tell you 
                    Bullshit, you just have to play 40 hours and buy the DLC first.
                    >Its not a story DLC would tell you 

FTFY
    Out of curiosity, what makes this "obviously taken off instagram?" I've personally never used it, so I'm not sure what's giving it away.

        Wouldn‘t have to be instagram, but the watermark in the upper left and the „gaming bible“ tag in the upper right give away that it‘s been taken from somewhere. Then the square format speaks for instagram. 
            I appreciate the insight, thank you!
Wow! That's epic! I love how you jump onto any vehicle in the game in any situation. The entering animations make it even better looking. It makes me wonder why they didn't add exit animations. 
    Would take too long to show especially when you are in hurry like a crashing plane
        But it would be hilarious, like in GTA V when you have the huge plane and are about to crash
        Sounds like a bonus to me. Forces players who use vehicles to *commit* to the vehicles unless they can maneuver a safe place to disembark. Also gets good anti-vehicle players more rightly-earned kills.
            But then we wouldn't have many clips of people jumping out of jets to shoot people with handheld weapons.
    Why couldn’t  they make Star Wars like this 
    To be honest I love the enter animations for this game. It's something that I did know I needed in a Battlefield and I hope they never take it out. 
    I dunno, it seems really dumb to me. Immersion breaking. 
        LITERALLY. UNPLAYABLE. 
Du dun dun da dun dun - "Only in Battlefield".

        You probably don't know about the whole "Only in battlefield" thing.  


            Should be sound and music that's the best one
    I was hoping for the pirates of the Caribbean music to blast towards the end.
        Did everyone see that?       
Because I will *not* be doing it again
    Holy shit. That gave me some intense goosebumps.

Holy hell that is epic
I can hear the James Bond theme in the background 
This made r/all. We did it boys. We made it big time
Anyone else hear the Pirates of the Caribbean theme in their head for some reason 
I see you're an alumni of the Prometheus School of Running Away From Things

what I like about the Battlefield games is the realism 
The pilot was in his squad too, this is real teamwork
Couldn't he just have parachuted off?
    But that’s not video worthy 
        Someone should have told the medic, they didn't have to draw straws for the plane seat
Daaammmnnn
Only in battlefield. 
Welp. Guess I've got to go play Battlefield again
Only in Battlefield...
“WITNESS MEEEE!!”

*that medic probably*
that's some James Bond shit!

    Holy hell. This needs to be top.
that still only counts as one
_Cue Seven Nation Army Remix_
This is probably the coolest thing I’ve ever seen in a video game 
That was fucking boss
Not bad, but cool guys don't look at explosions.
Pilot: Oh my god how did you just appear?! You didn’t even have to climb in!
I love it when a plan comes together.
If you listen very, very carefully...the theme tune to "indiana jones" plays quietly in the background as he makes his improbable escape. 
Damn that behemoth exploding reminds me of my asshole after taco Tuesday. KERSPLOOOOSH!!!

Looks like a James Bond movie kind of escape.

Watching that dude run away and die in a firey blaze really sealed in the epicness. 
Cinematic af
Indiana jones theme was playing in my head there. 
this is INSANE wth this makes me want to start playing these games again
Some of the most epic stuff happens in battlefield! That's why I love it
That’s really cool
Now that’s just fucking impressive.
Yooo whaaat?!?!?! That’s amazing, bravo.
r/madlads
Man that was some Michael Bay shit right there.
The prometheus school of running away from things offers you a scholarship.
You just saw your buddy get engulfed in flames
U/UnsurmountableRaid
Indy!
'Bond, James Bond'
SICK
I heard the BF theme in my head
Cues 007 Theme Music
The way the medic just accepts his fate gets me everytime.
so that's where the other gif comes from!
Was expecting a parajump for the duration of the video.

That ending hit hard.
What gun is that at the beginning?
The best thing I see today.
I. N. C. R. E. D. I. B. L. E
I'm buying this game.
Pilot: Hop on chap! Have a ride!
That's got James Bond written all over it 
DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
OMFG
Holy fuck... 
Fucking Badass!  
So is this James Bond lost episode ?
Ill admit, i didnt see that one comin...nice :)

Fuck this game is cool as fuuuuurrrkkk
I'm buying bf1 
Damn dude 
What game is this?
    the laws of physics violator
Wow, so hard to press F. 
This is some classic 1942 shenanigans. Just grab any bomber and scoop up your friend holding down "E"
Some of the most epic stuff happens in battlefield! That's why I love it


RIP squadmate engulfed in flames
This is like an action movie
This would be sick in a movie. That part where the medic gets dead was amazing. 
this game is so sick. do alot of people play still?
There has to be sure.
I love it when a plan comes together
This should be movie!
Was not expecting that
Teammate's gonna return in one of your next games as your arch nemesis
I ve got a smelting tool in the Behemoth, exit to the epicness of this clip really needs sound.
Anyone else hearing A Team Theme playing behind, followed by Soldier yelling "I love it when a plan comes together!" at backseat of plane?
And I was listening to the 7 Nation Army coincidence? Yes btw wow
This needs to be a commerical, I'd buy it again.
Directed by Michael Bay
Wwwwhhhaaatttt??!!! That's honestly 💯 percent bullshit. Can that be faked? Moon landing like?
[deleted]
    literally who cares

also personally whenever im on top of a blimp and its gonna explode id rather run off it long ways for that sweet battlefield epicness
    Tbh its better if he was
Fucking savage
Love these vids...

But...am I the only one who thinks parachuting onto an enemy airship and hanging out on it is kind of a chickenshit strategy?
    It's a bit scrubby, but still good fun. 
His Dough-Boi didn't make it though..
Couldn’t be any more choreographed 
This is really dope but the adrenaline never kicks in because there is nothing at stake with these games— if you die you’ll just respawn five seconds later. This is why these games are starting to fade away. There isn’t anymore adrenaline. 
When you look back at the blimp exploding you can tell if it's a fake they edited that in but it's still a cool gift.
People still play this game? Neat
    I bet you have some sort of brain damage and never get any attention so you have to come here to comment completely fucking stupid comments that make you feel special because "i dOnT pLaY oLd GamEs dO peOPle sTiLL pLAy tHIs gamE and i aM fUckInG rEtaRtED" WHY WOULDN'T PEOPLE PLAY THE NEWEST FUCKING BF GAME?
        Yeah

i didnt even know u can enter a plane in this game, though only way is spawning in one
A parachute would deploy from his arse like in all other BF games.
    Only if he was a pilot???
        We're all pilots on this blessed day.
            Speak for yourself.
                I am all pilots on this blessed day!
                    Happy cake day ❤
                        22 days old, but thanks!
        I dont know why you have dislikes, regular soldiers dont have this
            All soldiers have parashutes.
                Wow really? Bought the game a month after the release and never noticed. TIL
                    Parachutes only work when you are a certain amount of distance from the ground.
                        Are there any buildings or such tall enough in this one? I remember abusing the mechanic a lot more in previous games. 
                            I've never seen the prompt to open parachute when jumping from buildings. Honestly I thought they had removed it completely from base kit.

It's much better this way, earlier BF titles had practically no fall damage at all, it was stupid.
                            There now is a minimum distance you have to be from the ground to activate it. But I assume their are few buildings that are high enough.
                        This would happen if you keep turned on the option of the automatic parachute deployment. I've always turned off the option in every bf i played 
                            Yes but bf1 still has a minimum distance it is allowed to deploy unlike (or much higher than) bf4. I also have autodeploy disabled.
                not in batllefield 1
                    Yes they do. Everyone has a parachute in BF1.

Have you literally never bailed from a Bomber to cap a flag before?
                        because only pilots have parachutes?
                            You and the five people upvoting you really need to jump in a BF1 match and bail from a plane.

**Everyone has a parachute.**
                                try to jump from bridge or ledge on sinai
                                afaik you only get the parachute if you enter a plane
                    they absolutely do; you can parachute from the cliffs of Sinai as infantry, cavalry, tanker, and you can do it again and again. Lack of big buildings is probably why people don't notice. Fall damage is also really inconsistent so I don't recommend using the parachute 
                    Yes they do. Stop spreading misinformation. https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/4x42et/quickie_do_all_classes_have_parachutes_or_just/
            Wow never knew people were this clueless to think that only pilots had parachutes
SPECULATE, MOTHERFUCKER!

        Just hearing this brings back so many great memories. Really hoping for a return to the BC1 style campaign again. 
            TBH I'd be quite happy with a re-release for PC since we never got it!
            Honestly best BF campaign hands down
                That's a pretty low bar though (BC1 was still great, no question)
            Although you mentioned campaign specifically, BC1 was my popped cherry in the online multiplayer world. I'm truly keeping my fingers crossed for the BC3 rumors. A military fps (BC 1&2) with a lot of character in itself.
            Rumor has it the BF installment for 2019 will be BC3.  Unfortunately I missed BC1. 
        Awesome. Always wondered who actually recorded it

        Man, the Bad Company games have such a unique feel. 
        Now can someone put them together?
        This brings back so many fond memories of the game even from the BC1 beta. Damn I miss that game
        Jesus, I've been looking for that song for years. 
    Omg the feels 
    Hah, "battlefield music" refers to the intro to 1942, not some BC bitch boi shit

        I know, I still like the BC music though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9iBJ7r315E 

Not my video but I thought it was a gross injustice to show the clip without music.

Honestly I don't even know why OP would have posted that garbage
    Have my upvote you lovely SOB. That theme still gives me chills.
    Excellent editing. Thanks for posting this. Only in Battlefield...
        Oh it's not mine. Someone posted the link in the comments somewhere so I just wanted more people to see it
    Unpopular opinion time:

I think BF3's edit of the theme is the best. 
    That was beautiful *tear*
    I think it's astonishing how well this fits together with another Battlefield theme:

http://www.youtubemultiplier.com/5a6a7e91de302-only-in-battlefield-one.php

(Maximize the left video!)

Works even better in my opinion
        Wow that worked amazing although the play button doesn't seem to work on mobile it only played one of the videos so I had to quickly tap em
    It’d be perfect if it was the BF1 version of the theme.
    Man this is so amazing.  
Also it makes me want BF2143 and Titan mode!!!!!!!
    That was amazing! 
    Thank you for this. I have beef with Gaming Bible ever since they shared a GTA clip I made and posted on reddit, but they credited some guy who reposted it and claimed it as his own. I messaged Gaming Bible on Facebook but heard nothing back.

And you’re right; it’s much better with the music!
    But that's the shit music, why not use the classic BF theme that actually fits the setting?
        If you can find one up to your standards then be my guest. It's just a fact that this is better than a muted 4:3 Instagram version
        https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/7sxlks/_/dt8zun8
    Also it's uncropped and unwatermarked without shitty intro/outro videos :) you're the man
Ba dum dum dum dumdum! Ba dum dum dum dumdum!
Bf2142 intro reborn baby
    1942*
    a NUMBER off my friend
I know it's a deliberate marketing tagline, but holy shit stuff like this is literally "only in Battlefield", nothing else comes close
That or the James Bond theme. 
It's also a definition of progress in gaming industry. When I was a kid I had a blast playing this https://youtu.be/faJ0Jd5HaRg?t=239 , today it looks like some green and brown areas mixed together ...
    Red Baron is the game that made me want a WWI fps. BF1 made one of my childhood game wishes come true.
I feel like the Indiana Jones theme would work best here, with the crescendo as he gets into the plane. 
You mean the only thing missing is the terrible hip fire that completely misses everything
I couldn't help but here the Indiana Jones tune
More like the James Bond theme. 
[deleted]
    I thought it was the actual escape with the music at the end. :(
It’s amazing that no other game franchise has been able to replicate this sort of gameplay. 

From the outside this looks completely coordinated but in battlefield it could really be either one. 

Truly a great series 
It’s ok I basically played that tune with escalation in my head as the video ended. 
**SAIL!**
Nah. It's usually. "Dude where are you?" "Let's flank this guys...fuck he just went all rambo again." "Bro help me!" "Ha fuck you bro, good luck." That happens to me.
    I end up either in a Solo squad because they're all private or in a squad with the newbie who doesn't move the train an inch while using the howitzer.

I had to take a break from the game because though I don't mind playing MP solo it does wear on me.
        Well if you got a mic and play PS4 you can add me. I like meeting new people but im not always available since I work and study. Username is coconio. Let me know.
            I don't have the game for PS4 but thank you! It's tough finding reasonably chill people to play with on PC.
            How is it on PS4 these days? When I was playing about 6 months ago it was basically not possible to get into a non-empty operations match, and when you did it was a massive beat down.
                I think that was due to a problem with DICE's matchmaking rather than player group size. I play on Xbone which has the smaller player base of all the systems and I can get into operations reasonably well still. 
                It really depends. Also I play conquest more becuase I don't  have much time to play long matches.
    My squad goes full medics so it's a constant stream of people yelling "I NEED A SCOOP" "I GOT YOUR SCOOP".
Add me "lilmoog" 
    Will do, I'm Darthriordan

    Thank you for this
    That was awesome!
How do you NOT hear that as he's flying away?!
I prefer the Pirates of the Caribbean theme
Theme song played in my head as well, seems a perfect fit.
That's exactly what I was thinking!
I hum that song whenever things get really crazy in any game...or when I'm about to attempt something incredibly foolish.

    Ironic....
        He could save others from death, but not himself...
            Playing medic I have come to accept my self running into a room with teammates holding the respawn button while I am left alone and facing the waves of angry ottoman attackers.

Jumping into the fire was probably cathartic. 
                When I was a Fire Marshall in the Navy their was a gas leak in a room below decks. (Basically a basement) Two men were stuck down there and I ran in without a breathing device to pull them out. Didn’t hesitate for a second. I only managed to pulled one guy out. Later my supervisor told me I was either brave or dumb for doing that. 

Here’s the thing, when they said leak I thought they meant water leak. So I ran in there thinking the room was flooding, not filling with murder vapors. 
                    Brotherman, keep that last part to yourself and accept the hero-ness. It is well deserved. 
            Never has a meme been more relevant 
        Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
            Its not a story DICE would tell you 
                Bullshit, you just have to play 40 hours and buy the DLC first.
                >Its not a story DLC would tell you 

FTFY
Out of curiosity, what makes this "obviously taken off instagram?" I've personally never used it, so I'm not sure what's giving it away.

    Wouldn‘t have to be instagram, but the watermark in the upper left and the „gaming bible“ tag in the upper right give away that it‘s been taken from somewhere. Then the square format speaks for instagram. 
        I appreciate the insight, thank you!
Would take too long to show especially when you are in hurry like a crashing plane
    But it would be hilarious, like in GTA V when you have the huge plane and are about to crash
    Sounds like a bonus to me. Forces players who use vehicles to *commit* to the vehicles unless they can maneuver a safe place to disembark. Also gets good anti-vehicle players more rightly-earned kills.
        But then we wouldn't have many clips of people jumping out of jets to shoot people with handheld weapons.
Why couldn’t  they make Star Wars like this 
To be honest I love the enter animations for this game. It's something that I did know I needed in a Battlefield and I hope they never take it out. 
I dunno, it seems really dumb to me. Immersion breaking. 
    LITERALLY. UNPLAYABLE.

                        There now is a minimum distance you have to be from the ground to activate it. But I assume their are few buildings that are high enough.
                    This would happen if you keep turned on the option of the automatic parachute deployment. I've always turned off the option in every bf i played 
                        Yes but bf1 still has a minimum distance it is allowed to deploy unlike (or much higher than) bf4. I also have autodeploy disabled.
            not in batllefield 1
                Yes they do. Everyone has a parachute in BF1.

Have you literally never bailed from a Bomber to cap a flag before?
                    because only pilots have parachutes?
                        You and the five people upvoting you really need to jump in a BF1 match and bail from a plane.

**Everyone has a parachute.**
                            try to jump from bridge or ledge on sinai
                            afaik you only get the parachute if you enter a plane
                they absolutely do; you can parachute from the cliffs of Sinai as infantry, cavalry, tanker, and you can do it again and again. Lack of big buildings is probably why people don't notice. Fall damage is also really inconsistent so I don't recommend using the parachute 
                Yes they do. Stop spreading misinformation. https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/4x42et/quickie_do_all_classes_have_parachutes_or_just/
        Wow never knew people were this clueless to think that only pilots had parachutes

    Just hearing this brings back so many great memories. Really hoping for a return to the BC1 style campaign again. 
        TBH I'd be quite happy with a re-release for PC since we never got it!
        Honestly best BF campaign hands down
            That's a pretty low bar though (BC1 was still great, no question)
        Although you mentioned campaign specifically, BC1 was my popped cherry in the online multiplayer world. I'm truly keeping my fingers crossed for the BC3 rumors. A military fps (BC 1&2) with a lot of character in itself.
        Rumor has it the BF installment for 2019 will be BC3.  Unfortunately I missed BC1. 
    Awesome. Always wondered who actually recorded it

    Goosebumps irl. Thanks.
    Man, the Bad Company games have such a unique feel. 
    Now can someone put them together?
    This brings back so many fond memories of the game even from the BC1 beta. Damn I miss that game
    Jesus, I've been looking for that song for years. 
Omg the feels 
Hah, "battlefield music" refers to the intro to 1942, not some BC bitch boi shit

    I know, I still like the BC music though.
Have my upvote you lovely SOB. That theme still gives me chills.
Excellent editing. Thanks for posting this. Only in Battlefield...
    Oh it's not mine. Someone posted the link in the comments somewhere so I just wanted more people to see it
Unpopular opinion time:

I think BF3's edit of the theme is the best. 
That was beautiful *tear*
I think it's astonishing how well this fits together with another Battlefield theme:

http://www.youtubemultiplier.com/5a6a7e91de302-only-in-battlefield-one.php

(Maximize the left video!)

Works even better in my opinion
    Wow that worked amazing although the play button doesn't seem to work on mobile it only played one of the videos so I had to quickly tap em
It’d be perfect if it was the BF1 version of the theme.
Man this is so amazing.  
Also it makes me want BF2143 and Titan mode!!!!!!!
That was amazing! 
Thank you for this. I have beef with Gaming Bible ever since they shared a GTA clip I made and posted on reddit, but they credited some guy who reposted it and claimed it as his own. I messaged Gaming Bible on Facebook but heard nothing back.

And you’re right; it’s much better with the music!
But that's the shit music, why not use the classic BF theme that actually fits the setting?
    If you can find one up to your standards then be my guest. It's just a fact that this is better than a muted 4:3 Instagram version
    https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/7sxlks/_/dt8zun8
Also it's uncropped and unwatermarked without shitty intro/outro videos :) you're the man
1942*
a NUMBER off my friend
Red Baron is the game that made me want a WWI fps. BF1 made one of my childhood game wishes come true.
I thought it was the actual escape with the music at the end. :(
I end up either in a Solo squad because they're all private or in a squad with the newbie who doesn't move the train an inch while using the howitzer.

I had to take a break from the game because though I don't mind playing MP solo it does wear on me.
    Well if you got a mic and play PS4 you can add me. I like meeting new people but im not always available since I work and study. Username is coconio. Let me know.
        I don't have the game for PS4 but thank you! It's tough finding reasonably chill people to play with on PC.
        How is it on PS4 these days? When I was playing about 6 months ago it was basically not possible to get into a non-empty operations match, and when you did it was a massive beat down.
            I think that was due to a problem with DICE's matchmaking rather than player group size. I play on Xbone which has the smaller player base of all the systems and I can get into operations reasonably well still. 
            It really depends. Also I play conquest more becuase I don't  have much time to play long matches.
My squad goes full medics so it's a constant stream of people yelling "I NEED A SCOOP" "I GOT YOUR SCOOP".
Will do, I'm Darthriordan
Some body give this man gold. 

Edit: this ironic gold has made me laugh more than Reddit ever has.

Thanks for the laugh stranger!
    Some body gave this man gold.
        Some body once told me
            The gold was gonna role me. 
                The world was gonna gold me
                    Gold gold gold gold gold gold
                        Jole Heyman? 
                        Okay Glumgold chill out.
                        Well...
                    Somebody once told me the world is gonna gold me.
                Ive got a smelting tool in the shed.
                    She was looking kinda gold with her finger and her gold and the shape of gold on her goldhead
            Somebody touched ma spaguett
                There’s vomit on his sweater already 
                I SEE A FACE

    what kind of fucking person would do this
Damn that's hilarious
Audibly laughed at how dumb it'd be trying to hold them back in that situation.

That last support quote has me imagining him shrugging violently like DUDE WAT
Happy cake day
Thank you for this
That was awesome!
Ironic....
    He could save others from death, but not himself...
        Playing medic I have come to accept my self running into a room with teammates holding the respawn button while I am left alone and facing the waves of angry ottoman attackers.

Jumping into the fire was probably cathartic. 
            When I was a Fire Marshall in the Navy their was a gas leak in a room below decks. (Basically a basement) Two men were stuck down there and I ran in without a breathing device to pull them out. Didn’t hesitate for a second. I only managed to pulled one guy out. Later my supervisor told me I was either brave or dumb for doing that. 

Here’s the thing, when they said leak I thought they meant water leak. So I ran in there thinking the room was flooding, not filling with murder vapors. 
                Brotherman, keep that last part to yourself and accept the hero-ness. It is well deserved. 
        Never has a meme been more relevant 
    Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
        Its not a story DICE would tell you 
            Bullshit, you just have to play 40 hours and buy the DLC first.
            >Its not a story DLC would tell you 

FTFY
Wouldn‘t have to be instagram, but the watermark in the upper left and the „gaming bible“ tag in the upper right give away that it‘s been taken from somewhere. Then the square format speaks for instagram. 
    I appreciate the insight, thank you!
But it would be hilarious, like in GTA V when you have the huge plane and are about to crash
Sounds like a bonus to me. Forces players who use vehicles to *commit* to the vehicles unless they can maneuver a safe place to disembark. Also gets good anti-vehicle players more rightly-earned kills.
    But then we wouldn't have many clips of people jumping out of jets to shoot people with handheld weapons.
LITERALLY. UNPLAYABLE. 
m'airship
I teared up to this reference....
F
You probably don't know about the whole "Only in battlefield" thing.  


    Should be sound and music that's the best one
Did everyone see that?       
Because I will *not* be doing it again
Pssst, look up.

I dont know why you have dislikes, regular soldiers dont have this
    All soldiers have parashutes.
        Wow really? Bought the game a month after the release and never noticed. TIL
            Parachutes only work when you are a certain amount of distance from the ground.
                Are there any buildings or such tall enough in this one? I remember abusing the mechanic a lot more in previous games. 
                    I've never seen the prompt to open parachute when jumping from buildings. Honestly I thought they had removed it completely from base kit.

Must be someone from /r/firstworldanarchists

Playing medic I have come to accept my self running into a room with teammates holding the respawn button while I am left alone and facing the waves of angry ottoman attackers.

Jumping into the fire was probably cathartic. 
    When I was a Fire Marshall in the Navy their was a gas leak in a room below decks. (Basically a basement) Two men were stuck down there and I ran in without a breathing device to pull them out. Didn’t hesitate for a second. I only managed to pulled one guy out. Later my supervisor told me I was either brave or dumb for doing that. 

Here’s the thing, when they said leak I thought they meant water leak. So I ran in there thinking the room was flooding, not filling with murder vapors. 
        Brotherman, keep that last part to yourself and accept the hero-ness. It is well deserved. 
Never has a meme been more relevant 
Its not a story DICE would tell you 
    Bullshit, you just have to play 40 hours and buy the DLC first.

Wow really? Bought the game a month after the release and never noticed. TIL
    Parachutes only work when you are a certain amount of distance from the ground.
        Are there any buildings or such tall enough in this one? I remember abusing the mechanic a lot more in previous games. 
            I've never seen the prompt to open parachute when jumping from buildings. Honestly I thought they had removed it completely from base kit.

It's much better this way, earlier BF titles had practically no fall damage at all, it was stupid.
            There now is a minimum distance you have to be from the ground to activate it. But I assume their are few buildings that are high enough.
        This would happen if you keep turned on the option of the automatic parachute deployment. I've always turned off the option in every bf i played 
            Yes but bf1 still has a minimum distance it is allowed to deploy unlike (or much higher than) bf4. I also have autodeploy disabled.
not in batllefield 1
    Yes they do. Everyone has a parachute in BF1.

Have you literally never bailed from a Bomber to cap a flag before?
        because only pilots have parachutes?
            You and the five people upvoting you really need to jump in a BF1 match and bail from a plane.

**Everyone has a parachute.**
                try to jump from bridge or ledge on sinai
                afaik you only get the parachute if you enter a plane
    they absolutely do; you can parachute from the cliffs of Sinai as infantry, cavalry, tanker, and you can do it again and again. Lack of big buildings is probably why people don't notice. Fall damage is also really inconsistent so I don't recommend using the parachute 
    Yes they do. Stop spreading misinformation. https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/4x42et/quickie_do_all_classes_have_parachutes_or_just/
That's a pretty low bar though (BC1 was still great, no question)

I think that was due to a problem with DICE's matchmaking rather than player group size. I play on Xbone which has the smaller player base of all the systems and I can get into operations reasonably well still. 
It really depends. Also I play conquest more becuase I don't  have much time to play long matches.
The gold was gonna role me.
