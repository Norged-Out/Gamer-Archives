[[Battlefield 1 is actually better than Battlefield 2042 in this time.]]





BF1 will be that way for a long time. Yet, people insist on playing the "latest and greatest" but 2042 is definitely not the greatest and probably never will be.
    Ive learned that most cod fans insist on buying the latest game even if everyone and their mother knows it will me hot garbage

              cough Vanguard cough
So I was playing 2042 for the last few weeks and just couldn’t do it anymore. I need to feel like I’m actually playing BF when I play BF. I spent the last 3 years or so on and off playing BFV. Decided on a whim to go back to BF1 and it’s just crazy how much more love and dedication went into it vs. 2042. BF1 and BFV are truly amazing.
Pls. Do.not.buy. 2042. EA needs to realise what we want and that they can't sell us garbage like that anymore. Sadly, a big part of the fanbse is proving them right. The next bf will be even worse and i blame each and every one who buys this garbage.
Bf1 Verdun and tannenburg really good shooters I have played in the ww1 era.
Still playing it since its release, I just hate the balancing (including Chinese hackers on eu-servers, exploiters, toxicity in the chat… ).btw, the game is pretty good and FUN ! No comparison possible with that 2042.
Hard take to post in this sub
Battlefield 2042 isn’t bad, it’s just in the beta like every other battlefield. Remember that battlefield 1 also had a beta that came with its own doohickeys.

Edit: oh wait… I’m wrong.
    The other battlefields had good basics that stayed. 2042 has basic issues, that are embedded in the game (specialists for instance). The. Problems. Of. 2042. Are. Not. The. Bugs.
    Battlefield 1 had developers who were able to use their experience to fine tune the game, 2042, has mostly new developers from different franchises...I said all that to say, I don't think the comparison you highlighted will be remotely the same going forward.
Not even controversial.
Just wish multiplayer was free, but yeah. Just got it for Christmas and I’m having a blast on the campings. However you spell it.

        I am assuming they are talking about DLC
            No. Xbox. You need a subscription to play online unfortunately.
