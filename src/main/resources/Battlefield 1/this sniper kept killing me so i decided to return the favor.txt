[[this sniper kept killing me so i decided to return the favor]]





Ah, yes, my great grandfather shared a similar story. 
    "Well, sonny... Back during the Great War, I suffered many casualties at the hands of a single German sniper."

"Umm... *casualties*?"

"But do not worry, boy. I learned from those multiple deaths, and returned to combat in a plane, which I parachuted out of, and then proceeded to glide down to the roof of the building in which the sniper was camped out."

"Okay, this sounds a bit--"

"Then I tossed some dynamite above his position and sent his kraut ass flying."

"Then what?"

"Tea bagged him."
        Gee whizz grandpa, I'm glad you finally got gud.
            Grandpa: How's that sound billy?

Billy: Sounds like your fulla shit Granpa

        Casualties can also mean injuries, so its *possible*
        Casualties can be dead or injured. Not a criticism of your story, it was funny as fuck, it's just a commonly misunderstood word.
        A "casualtie" can be just an injury. 
            A casualty is a non-plural version of "casualtie"
        that moment you realize your spawning as a brand new troop and not the one you just died as.
I love this! I don't understand why so many people don't try to take out "high priority" targets more often. I had a match a while ago where someone on the enemy team sat behind E on Sinai in a tank the WHOLE match. We would capture it, run away, then he'd drive right back up and recapture the objective. I must have ran at him 20 times in a row as assault throwing AT grenades, trying to drop mines, using the AT gun. I got close to killing him so many times, while spamming chat to go kill the dude and no one ever bothered trying. He finished like 50-0 and nobody cared. Sure I tunneled hard but at that point we were being dominated and I just wanted him dead. Long rant but sometimes taking out that pesky sniper or tank driver can really pay off. 
    Everything a sniper kills me and they are sitting somewhere I can reach, I make an effort to kill them after I respawn. 
        As a sniper that constantly moves positions. If I keep killing a specific player and that player eventually kills me I normally congratulate them. I sure as hell don't camp unless it's useful to defend an area.
            I follow the rules of "never take more than 2 shots from the same position."
                I've not really used scout much, but is it possible to avoid that scope glare? I feel like I barely see then anymore.
                    Iron sights = no glare.
                        Pretty sure the marksman version doesn't have glare either.
                            Best of both worlds with only a fraction of the disadvantages that the Infantry and the Sniper have to deal with.
                                What's the infantry disadvantage? 
                                    no zoomy zoomy makes for less shooty shooty
                        Go full Simo Hayha (I never spell his last name right fight me) on them. 

Seriously iron sights plus the periscope and you're good to go.

                                I do a fantastic Salma Hayek impression!
                                    How good are you with a boa constrictor?
                                ACKCHUALLY ES "SOME MORE HI-HAT" FIR WHEN YOU RELLY LIKE THE DRUMMER
                            On hardcore mode this is very fun to do and a lot of people get pissed off when you killed them with an ironsight weapon from 400m away
                            No kidding. Periscope is a godsend on the Sinai Operation when defending. I came out with the highest team score by doing basically nothing but spotting. I killed maybe 10 players, but all my points came from spots
                        Isn't it 4x or less zoom for no glare?
                    Any scope at x4 or lower will not give out a glint. 
                    Only the Sniper version has glint. Marksman doesn't.
                    <6x magnification is no scope glare

                Always relocate. For every class. 
            I don't like playing Scout much, but every now and then if no one on my team is spotting I'll take it upon myself to do it and help out the guys in planes/mortars/etc. Anyway if I ever get a kill where I think "I would be annoyed if that happened to me", I wait a few seconds fixated on my last shot until I think they've had time to respawn, so they don't see me move in killcam. Then I run away to a new spot and aim right where I just was. I feel like about half the time this results in a kill, and if it works once, you can usually get them a couple more times before they realize what you're doing.
                Yea that's a pretty good way to get kills but it does encourage the other player to start thinking ahead of you if they actually want to pursue you. It's given me quite a few good chase and hunt stories.
                    Even if they get me in the end I got them at least a few times first. People like you are great, keep hunting
            Yeah and a smart sniper never stands by the window. He stands further back in the dark. 

Edit: Back in mah time, we didn't have no fancy prone to rely on.
                Not a sniper, but I make it a point to never stand close to any window or wall. I've seen people clip through walls fairly often, and I think we've all seen plenty of conspicuous rifle barrels sticking out of openings
                    I love taking dynamite to the walls at that point it's so satisfying watching the walls crumble in bf1
            Coming from r/all. You are autistic explaining a real good strategy of not staying in the same place while sniping! You identity as a sniper that constantly moves? Lol wut 
                Well yeah if he stays in the same place he will get noticed and likely killed.  He will instead kill a few people and then move to another location and hide out. Snipers far too often stay in one place and become easy targets. 
                    Woah such revelating commentary! 
                Explaining that in a game i play a sniper class and don't stay in the same place to be useful and not get killed as much. If you are coming from r/all be aware of the sub you are coming into and what we are talking about.
        Snipers and bipodders. If you're going to stay in the same place after killing me expect my knife in your chest.
            Expect two incendiary traps. 
            /r/iamverybadass
                He's just having fun. Not a big deal really.
            And my axe. 
        I have the same goal, but I usually either end up running down the same sight-line and getting killed or I do make it up to him and empty my entire clip into the ground right next to him and get killed.
            That's why you kill him with a shovel!
        [BFF did it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7R1mn6fxsE)
        Often times in hardcore it's not even possible to know where the snipers are... that said if I find them it feels good when I kill them.
    Yea I went 31-0 as a tank and the other team finally they decided to gang up on me. That is the one issue with battlefield is there is no overall commander.
        RIP BF2 commander :(
            I mean, it's not like people actually listened to the commander.
                I was a great commander in BF2. I remember one match I was complimented so many times by my team. I can't put how good that memory is into words.

FeltGoodMan!
                In BF2 people did listen to the commander because he was literally fighting in the battle. All the commander had to do was enter the trailer to use his special powers. Dropping supplies and vehicles on top of enemies was hysterical as well. 
                    I remember seeing a supply drop come in and always landing on top of a building at Karkand
    Wouldn't it be cool to have over time, if an enemy keeps getting spotted without dying for a longer and longer time it puts a bounty on him? Maybe double the points?
        That is a nifty idea you got there
    Battlefield needs more players like you 
    I play with a squad of people and we dedicate ourselves to being that squad focused purely on getting rid of pesky things like that. We never get top of scoreboard but it is very easy to see when our actions allow our team to breakthrough and take an objective.
    Yeah I played a domination match and this tank was just sitting at the edge of the map picking people off at C. I was literally the only one making an effort to try and take him out. Never have I been so frustrated with a team before. 
        I honestly get more frustrated when those fuckers are on my own team. I've actually killed one of my own teammates when in hardcore mode for doing this.
            Oh no. Someone is playing the game in a way he has fun and not how you like it. Better teamkill him.
    I was on the match (yesterday?), you're talking about the lethaldeath player, right? That dude had such a high K/D ratio
    Yeah same. It's nice when I'm running in a squad with my buddies and we can flank the enemy in operations to take out their AA or stationary guns or even a building with dynamite. 
    This is exactly how I've been feeling lately. I play medic mostly and I just hope one of the many assault players would destroy it. I don't play assault but I end up having to switch classes when I die just to try to take out the tank alone.
    We might've been in the same game! I tried charging the tank a few times but either it or snipers would get me.

Eventually we took every objective but E and F and turned it around. But man that freaking tank was blowing everyone up.
    tunneled?
        Focusing on one thing in particular.
    Had a motherfucker do that on Rush, just sat in the tank on the cliffs talking shit, killed him a few times, by the time he couldn't have a tank anymore he quit
    I was playing Sinai operations and there was this one landship stirring at spawn (In a restricted area for us, I'm pretty sure), just mortaring the hell out of our team. Kept yelling at the bombers to fuck him up but no one listened and he ended up like 42-2. At least he wasn't taking the objective like with you though, might have been why we won.
    Learn to use the barrage bomber. Perfect way to get rid of good or ignored tankers. 

You can 1 shot any tank. 
    The tank drivers make the match a lot of the time (and whether people take them out or not). Picking something other than the A7V puts the team at a disadvantage imo
I know 1 stick of dynamite would've killed him. But I probably would've used all 3. Just to rub salt in the wound 
    If it was me, you best believe I would have used all of em.
        And blown yourself up in the process.  Or get shot by someone else just as you're about to detonate it
            By any means necessary. 

If I have to die with em it's fine, knowing they won't kill me from that same spot is worth my death.
                The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
    i would have tried to throw one, slipped and died and then a horse would probably piss on me.
        That's my fetish
            Slipping and dying? 
                You can only do it once, but man is it sexy 
Yesterday took out a sniper with a well placed shot through that hole in the iron windscreen that he puts down to supposedly stay safe. I swear sniping in this game is tons more satisfying.
    Once you get the Martini Henry it is even better.
        Oh man but they nerfed it haven't they? I used the Russian sniper rifle.
            I dont think so actually. To me it still seems just as powerful.
            Ironically they actually nerfed the Russians RoF. 
                Aww i loved that gun
                    its still great, dont worry. I barely even noticed the change.
            Hopefully they don't nerf it. Martini Henry is a great example of a really fun gun that requires real skill to use it to its full effect. I think DICE got it right with this one.
                It doesn't take much skill really 
                I seem to remember something about a nerf in the patch notes.
    I like taking out snipers with a well placed AT rocket. If you miss you're dead, but it's satisfying to overkill so hard.
    I don't get why people use that shield. Most of the time it's like "hey I'm right behind this hole shoot me here!" Free head shots.
Good kill but you only get a 9/10 for no bagging.
    Funny thing is I did t bag him at the end but I couldn't fit it in the 15 seconds :/
        Outstanding soldier 10/10

            Ahh ok, never heard of 9gag but yeah.. what ever
                I will try to clarify for you.


Basically, there is this cesspool of cancer called 9gag, similar to reddit, but instead, the community is more toxic, more reposty, and most hot posts are admin mosts that have generated upvotes. retards just farm upvotes over their for nooooo reason by posting their reactions, like 
>Came here to write this

>Idk how I feel about this.

Etc.

TL;DR, 9Gag is the cancer of internet.
                    Sorry mate, never heard of it. Sounds shit btw.. I'll avoid it if ai can. Thanks for the heads up. 
                        yeah, sorry for assuming...
                            No wukkers, see you on the battlefield. 
I wish these building were fully destructable

so much camping happens in them
I prefer the limpet charges to accomplish through wall kills. Pesky snipers one the floor above you camping the stairway? Throw the limpet charge on the ceiling above you and it will level half the house. Great kill by the way. The way you approach it makes it look like you are doing gods work! 
    Genius
        I do the same, just drop ammo pack, grab another limpet and rinse/repeat until all the houses are levelled
I feel you, I feel you so much fellow non-scout.

        Snipers just love it when a tank hunter landship decides to play with them... bonus points if your crew on the guns is getting angles on other targets while you do.

Ive noticed peeps on buildings that I've never been able to get to. Is this how they get there? Parachute? 
    Yep.  People getting on top of parts of the Cheteau on Ballroom Blitz can be annoying little bastards especially scouts.
    yep!
        Ahhh... now to figure out how the hell to do it.
            i keep trying. im like 1/100.  i always just barely miss sticking the landing.
So was he playing with no volume on or something? Shouldn't it have made a sound when they landed? 
    Most generally players don't pay attention to noise. If he was sniping chances are he was looking through the scope and assumed it was a teammate. 
        Yeah, most players are absolutely clueless to sounds around them. Granted that sometimes it's tough to distinguish between enemies and your own loud ass teammates... 
No one's really going to care about this comment but I need to say it eventually.  I'm a huge FPS fan and have been forever, since Duck Hunt even.  I stopped around Black Ops 2.  There's something I think had always been missing and it is nails on chalkboard to me when I think about it.  Dead bodies need to remain in field all game and not vanish in multiplayer games.  Can you imagine that shit?  Wander into some snipers den in some game, dead bodies everywhere?  You know that fucker has that place on lock and you might be next, or might wander up the steps to see the sniper gone and the room empty.  /bam a shell drops you through the window, that was what was going down.  Now you're another one in the pile, better luck next respawn.
    I'm sure there are technical reason why they don't do this, but I agree it would be awesome.
        They'll all tell you it's too taxing on memory.
    Quit then too. Member rainbow six vegas? Ahh
        I missed that one.  Would hear about it a lot from all the headshot honchos in different games.
            Truely golden at one point. Had to abanfon it too. Smh
The house at E where all the scrubs with no skill hide. Ahhh, like fine wine. I have also enjoyed finding new ways to blow it up using assault class gadgets - and more recently, limpet! - every time I play this map. Keep fighting the good fight, OP!
    Whenever I get the mortar Artillery Truck I make it my business to paste all the houses around that area, especially in Operations, as you're almost always guaranteed to have the place overrun with snipers. Whatever I can't blow up I'll gas and blind.
    AT mine grenade at the top of the first staircase for most buildings like these 
I hate that dynamite doesn't stick to surfaces like c4 did on pretty much all previous BF games. 
    Well it is a bundle of dynamite and not C4. Limpets stick though.
        I don't see why c4 would stick to begin with anyway.  Will a limpet destroy tanks? 
            Yeah man, two will destroy anything, one will do serious damage.
                That's better than the dynamite.  2 on a tank and it's disabled and barely destroyed.  
Smoothest entry into a sniper perch.
Needs some Mission Impossible music to go along with it.
    ...And a windhelm scream just to add some comedic elements to it. 
Mostly run as support, and I have a loadout with limpets and HE mortars if I need to  take out buildings with troublesome snipers.
They really need to add bullet drop to snipers. There are far too many in this game. 
    There is bullet drop though, 12ms^2, which is faster than on earth. People just compensate via re-zeroing.
        Imo the bullet drop feels linear. I guess that's appropriate though, I remember reading the BF devs in 4 added artificially high drop to sniper and cannon rounds. At realistic setting and BF engagement ranges it was point and click.

Here in 1 I think they opted for 'sweet spot' instead of artificial bullet drop to address the same issue. 
        I think he probably wants it to be much more like BF4 and I don't disagree. And zeroing seems almost unnoticeable in this game unfortunately 
    That and add scope glint to Marksman variants. If you dont want your postition given away while you ADS the surroundings you should be forced to use insights.
        Agree
    There is bullet drop. Its just not as drastic as it was in past bf games.
        It's so unnoticeable that I don't even consider there to be bullet drop in this game. 
    I really wish there was bullet drop. It's the reason I can't snipe in this game. 

I'm accustomed to the other battlefield games where you had to account for bullet drop so I'm consistently aiming above peoples heads in BF1 to always have to bullets fly over them. 
        There is bullet drop in BF1, it's just not artificially magnified as much as in past titles.
If I could up vote that 100 times I would.

Hahahaha I imagined when you were parachuting your character was like "hehehe!" in an evil way.
Straight outta 007
It's always fun to stick a Limpet on the lower supports of that house and watch a snipers hopes and dreams crumble around him 
Calculated! well done!
I thought you were going to throw it down the chimney
DY-NO-MITE!
Did anyone else expect him to crash through the roof and crushing the sniper? That would've made this video 10 times better, that's for sure. 
Why does this look like it runs smoother than my gaming PC? Makes me sad I've never gotten my game to run perfectly yet :(
    Have you tried lowering the settings.  Depending on your GPU and CPU  that's prolly it.  I have gtx980 and can run on ultra 1080p 60fps
/r/BetterEveryLoop 
this redefines petty. i love it.
Same mentality people should use for tanks instead of bitching about it 
Too bad there aren't any killcams lol
Would've just been easier to put an AT mine at the bottom and bring the entire house down around him. Also removes the house from being used as a snipe point. 
Now only if this had the James Bond theme song in it. Brilliant. Mission accomplished agent
haha! that was filthy!
Words cannot describe how much I want to do this now
Good.......good.

This is something i would do with a limpet charge. Probably intentionally killing both of us.
I love doing this. I recently discovered my calling for blowing up stuff.
Squadmate- "Sniper on the roof!" 
BOOM
Me -"what roof?"
No feeling in the world like getting tracked down and killed for rustling some jimmies.

If I was the sniper I would've had the biggest smile on my face because he fucking rekt you so many times you had to completely change your game plan just for him. Now I wanna go play hahaha.
    If I would it be him after the first kill, I would have use the AT Rocket Launcher and took out the upper part of the house. What I do always to prevent little scrub snipers to have easy kills.
It's like overgrown in cod4.  
Did you waste a plane to do this? If so: fuck you.
    He didnt have a plane class so no
    Eh they're a dime a dozen 
Wait, no t-bag?

"Umm... *casualties*?"

"But do not worry, boy. I learned from those multiple deaths, and returned to combat in a plane, which I parachuted out of, and then proceeded to glide down to the roof of the building in which the sniper was camped out."

"Okay, this sounds a bit--"

"Then I tossed some dynamite above his position and sent his kraut ass flying."

"Then what?"

"Tea bagged him."

    As a sniper that constantly moves positions. If I keep killing a specific player and that player eventually kills me I normally congratulate them. I sure as hell don't camp unless it's useful to defend an area.
        I follow the rules of "never take more than 2 shots from the same position."
            I've not really used scout much, but is it possible to avoid that scope glare? I feel like I barely see then anymore.
                Iron sights = no glare.
                    Pretty sure the marksman version doesn't have glare either.
                        Best of both worlds with only a fraction of the disadvantages that the Infantry and the Sniper have to deal with.
                            What's the infantry disadvantage? 
                                no zoomy zoomy makes for less shooty shooty
                    Go full Simo Hayha (I never spell his last name right fight me) on them. 

Seriously iron sights plus the periscope and you're good to go.

                            I do a fantastic Salma Hayek impression!
                                How good are you with a boa constrictor?
                            ACKCHUALLY ES "SOME MORE HI-HAT" FIR WHEN YOU RELLY LIKE THE DRUMMER
                        On hardcore mode this is very fun to do and a lot of people get pissed off when you killed them with an ironsight weapon from 400m away
                        No kidding. Periscope is a godsend on the Sinai Operation when defending. I came out with the highest team score by doing basically nothing but spotting. I killed maybe 10 players, but all my points came from spots
                    Isn't it 4x or less zoom for no glare?
                Any scope at x4 or lower will not give out a glint. 
                Only the Sniper version has glint. Marksman doesn't.
                <6x magnification is no scope glare

            Always relocate. For every class. 
        I don't like playing Scout much, but every now and then if no one on my team is spotting I'll take it upon myself to do it and help out the guys in planes/mortars/etc. Anyway if I ever get a kill where I think "I would be annoyed if that happened to me", I wait a few seconds fixated on my last shot until I think they've had time to respawn, so they don't see me move in killcam. Then I run away to a new spot and aim right where I just was. I feel like about half the time this results in a kill, and if it works once, you can usually get them a couple more times before they realize what you're doing.
            Yea that's a pretty good way to get kills but it does encourage the other player to start thinking ahead of you if they actually want to pursue you. It's given me quite a few good chase and hunt stories.
                Even if they get me in the end I got them at least a few times first. People like you are great, keep hunting
        Yeah and a smart sniper never stands by the window. He stands further back in the dark. 

Edit: Back in mah time, we didn't have no fancy prone to rely on.
            Not a sniper, but I make it a point to never stand close to any window or wall. I've seen people clip through walls fairly often, and I think we've all seen plenty of conspicuous rifle barrels sticking out of openings
                I love taking dynamite to the walls at that point it's so satisfying watching the walls crumble in bf1
        Coming from r/all. You are autistic explaining a real good strategy of not staying in the same place while sniping! You identity as a sniper that constantly moves? Lol wut 
            Well yeah if he stays in the same place he will get noticed and likely killed.  He will instead kill a few people and then move to another location and hide out. Snipers far too often stay in one place and become easy targets. 
                Woah such revelating commentary! 
            Explaining that in a game i play a sniper class and don't stay in the same place to be useful and not get killed as much. If you are coming from r/all be aware of the sub you are coming into and what we are talking about.
    Snipers and bipodders. If you're going to stay in the same place after killing me expect my knife in your chest.
        Expect two incendiary traps. 
        /r/iamverybadass
            He's just having fun. Not a big deal really.
        And my axe. 
    I have the same goal, but I usually either end up running down the same sight-line and getting killed or I do make it up to him and empty my entire clip into the ground right next to him and get killed.
        That's why you kill him with a shovel!
    [BFF did it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7R1mn6fxsE)
    Often times in hardcore it's not even possible to know where the snipers are... that said if I find them it feels good when I kill them.
Yea I went 31-0 as a tank and the other team finally they decided to gang up on me. That is the one issue with battlefield is there is no overall commander.
    RIP BF2 commander :(
        I mean, it's not like people actually listened to the commander.
            I was a great commander in BF2. I remember one match I was complimented so many times by my team. I can't put how good that memory is into words.

FeltGoodMan!
            In BF2 people did listen to the commander because he was literally fighting in the battle. All the commander had to do was enter the trailer to use his special powers. Dropping supplies and vehicles on top of enemies was hysterical as well. 
                I remember seeing a supply drop come in and always landing on top of a building at Karkand
Wouldn't it be cool to have over time, if an enemy keeps getting spotted without dying for a longer and longer time it puts a bounty on him? Maybe double the points?
    That is a nifty idea you got there
Battlefield needs more players like you 
I play with a squad of people and we dedicate ourselves to being that squad focused purely on getting rid of pesky things like that. We never get top of scoreboard but it is very easy to see when our actions allow our team to breakthrough and take an objective.
Yeah I played a domination match and this tank was just sitting at the edge of the map picking people off at C. I was literally the only one making an effort to try and take him out. Never have I been so frustrated with a team before. 
    I honestly get more frustrated when those fuckers are on my own team. I've actually killed one of my own teammates when in hardcore mode for doing this.
        Oh no. Someone is playing the game in a way he has fun and not how you like it. Better teamkill him.
I was on the match (yesterday?), you're talking about the lethaldeath player, right? That dude had such a high K/D ratio
Yeah same. It's nice when I'm running in a squad with my buddies and we can flank the enemy in operations to take out their AA or stationary guns or even a building with dynamite. 
This is exactly how I've been feeling lately. I play medic mostly and I just hope one of the many assault players would destroy it. I don't play assault but I end up having to switch classes when I die just to try to take out the tank alone.
We might've been in the same game! I tried charging the tank a few times but either it or snipers would get me.

Eventually we took every objective but E and F and turned it around. But man that freaking tank was blowing everyone up.
tunneled?
    Focusing on one thing in particular.
Had a motherfucker do that on Rush, just sat in the tank on the cliffs talking shit, killed him a few times, by the time he couldn't have a tank anymore he quit
I was playing Sinai operations and there was this one landship stirring at spawn (In a restricted area for us, I'm pretty sure), just mortaring the hell out of our team. Kept yelling at the bombers to fuck him up but no one listened and he ended up like 42-2. At least he wasn't taking the objective like with you though, might have been why we won.
Learn to use the barrage bomber. Perfect way to get rid of good or ignored tankers. 

You can 1 shot any tank. 
The tank drivers make the match a lot of the time (and whether people take them out or not). Picking something other than the A7V puts the team at a disadvantage imo
If it was me, you best believe I would have used all of em.
    And blown yourself up in the process.  Or get shot by someone else just as you're about to detonate it
        By any means necessary. 

If I have to die with em it's fine, knowing they won't kill me from that same spot is worth my death.
            The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
i would have tried to throw one, slipped and died and then a horse would probably piss on me.
    That's my fetish
        Slipping and dying? 
            You can only do it once, but man is it sexy 
Once you get the Martini Henry it is even better.
    Oh man but they nerfed it haven't they? I used the Russian sniper rifle.
        I dont think so actually. To me it still seems just as powerful.
        Ironically they actually nerfed the Russians RoF. 
            Aww i loved that gun
                its still great, dont worry. I barely even noticed the change.
        Hopefully they don't nerf it. Martini Henry is a great example of a really fun gun that requires real skill to use it to its full effect. I think DICE got it right with this one.
            It doesn't take much skill really 
            I seem to remember something about a nerf in the patch notes.
I like taking out snipers with a well placed AT rocket. If you miss you're dead, but it's satisfying to overkill so hard.
I don't get why people use that shield. Most of the time it's like "hey I'm right behind this hole shoot me here!" Free head shots.
Funny thing is I did t bag him at the end but I couldn't fit it in the 15 seconds :/

                Sorry mate, never heard of it. Sounds shit btw.. I'll avoid it if ai can. Thanks for the heads up. 
                    yeah, sorry for assuming...
                        No wukkers, see you on the battlefield. 
Genius
    I do the same, just drop ammo pack, grab another limpet and rinse/repeat until all the houses are levelled
[deleted]
    Snipers just love it when a tank hunter landship decides to play with them... bonus points if your crew on the guns is getting angles on other targets while you do.
Yep.  People getting on top of parts of the Cheteau on Ballroom Blitz can be annoying little bastards especially scouts.
yep!
    Ahhh... now to figure out how the hell to do it.
        i keep trying. im like 1/100.  i always just barely miss sticking the landing.
Most generally players don't pay attention to noise. If he was sniping chances are he was looking through the scope and assumed it was a teammate. 
    Yeah, most players are absolutely clueless to sounds around them. Granted that sometimes it's tough to distinguish between enemies and your own loud ass teammates... 
I'm sure there are technical reason why they don't do this, but I agree it would be awesome.
    They'll all tell you it's too taxing on memory.
Quit then too. Member rainbow six vegas? Ahh
    I missed that one.  Would hear about it a lot from all the headshot honchos in different games.
        Truely golden at one point. Had to abanfon it too. Smh
Whenever I get the mortar Artillery Truck I make it my business to paste all the houses around that area, especially in Operations, as you're almost always guaranteed to have the place overrun with snipers. Whatever I can't blow up I'll gas and blind.
AT mine grenade at the top of the first staircase for most buildings like these 
Well it is a bundle of dynamite and not C4. Limpets stick though.
    I don't see why c4 would stick to begin with anyway.  Will a limpet destroy tanks? 
        Yeah man, two will destroy anything, one will do serious damage.
            That's better than the dynamite.  2 on a tank and it's disabled and barely destroyed.  
...And a windhelm scream just to add some comedic elements to it. 
There is bullet drop though, 12ms^2, which is faster than on earth. People just compensate via re-zeroing.
    Imo the bullet drop feels linear. I guess that's appropriate though, I remember reading the BF devs in 4 added artificially high drop to sniper and cannon rounds. At realistic setting and BF engagement ranges it was point and click.

Here in 1 I think they opted for 'sweet spot' instead of artificial bullet drop to address the same issue. 
    I think he probably wants it to be much more like BF4 and I don't disagree. And zeroing seems almost unnoticeable in this game unfortunately 
That and add scope glint to Marksman variants. If you dont want your postition given away while you ADS the surroundings you should be forced to use insights.
    Agree
There is bullet drop. Its just not as drastic as it was in past bf games.
    It's so unnoticeable that I don't even consider there to be bullet drop in this game. 
I really wish there was bullet drop. It's the reason I can't snipe in this game. 

I'm accustomed to the other battlefield games where you had to account for bullet drop so I'm consistently aiming above peoples heads in BF1 to always have to bullets fly over them. 
    There is bullet drop in BF1, it's just not artificially magnified as much as in past titles.
Yes
Have you tried lowering the settings.  Depending on your GPU and CPU  that's prolly it.  I have gtx980 and can run on ultra 1080p 60fps
If I would it be him after the first kill, I would have use the AT Rocket Launcher and took out the upper part of the house. What I do always to prevent little scrub snipers to have easy kills.
He didnt have a plane class so no
Eh they're a dime a dozen

Casualties can also mean injuries, so its *possible*
Casualties can be dead or injured. Not a criticism of your story, it was funny as fuck, it's just a commonly misunderstood word.
A "casualtie" can be just an injury. 
    A casualty is a non-plural version of "casualtie"
that moment you realize your spawning as a brand new troop and not the one you just died as.
As a sniper that constantly moves positions. If I keep killing a specific player and that player eventually kills me I normally congratulate them. I sure as hell don't camp unless it's useful to defend an area.
    I follow the rules of "never take more than 2 shots from the same position."
        I've not really used scout much, but is it possible to avoid that scope glare? I feel like I barely see then anymore.

                No kidding. Periscope is a godsend on the Sinai Operation when defending. I came out with the highest team score by doing basically nothing but spotting. I killed maybe 10 players, but all my points came from spots
            Isn't it 4x or less zoom for no glare?
        Any scope at x4 or lower will not give out a glint. 
        Only the Sniper version has glint. Marksman doesn't.
        <6x magnification is no scope glare

    Always relocate. For every class. 
I don't like playing Scout much, but every now and then if no one on my team is spotting I'll take it upon myself to do it and help out the guys in planes/mortars/etc. Anyway if I ever get a kill where I think "I would be annoyed if that happened to me", I wait a few seconds fixated on my last shot until I think they've had time to respawn, so they don't see me move in killcam. Then I run away to a new spot and aim right where I just was. I feel like about half the time this results in a kill, and if it works once, you can usually get them a couple more times before they realize what you're doing.
    Yea that's a pretty good way to get kills but it does encourage the other player to start thinking ahead of you if they actually want to pursue you. It's given me quite a few good chase and hunt stories.
        Even if they get me in the end I got them at least a few times first. People like you are great, keep hunting
Yeah and a smart sniper never stands by the window. He stands further back in the dark. 

Edit: Back in mah time, we didn't have no fancy prone to rely on.
    Not a sniper, but I make it a point to never stand close to any window or wall. I've seen people clip through walls fairly often, and I think we've all seen plenty of conspicuous rifle barrels sticking out of openings
        I love taking dynamite to the walls at that point it's so satisfying watching the walls crumble in bf1
Coming from r/all. You are autistic explaining a real good strategy of not staying in the same place while sniping! You identity as a sniper that constantly moves? Lol wut 
    Well yeah if he stays in the same place he will get noticed and likely killed.  He will instead kill a few people and then move to another location and hide out. Snipers far too often stay in one place and become easy targets. 
        Woah such revelating commentary! 
    Explaining that in a game i play a sniper class and don't stay in the same place to be useful and not get killed as much. If you are coming from r/all be aware of the sub you are coming into and what we are talking about.
Expect two incendiary traps.

    He's just having fun. Not a big deal really.
And my axe. 
That's why you kill him with a shovel!
I mean, it's not like people actually listened to the commander.
    I was a great commander in BF2. I remember one match I was complimented so many times by my team. I can't put how good that memory is into words.

FeltGoodMan!
    In BF2 people did listen to the commander because he was literally fighting in the battle. All the commander had to do was enter the trailer to use his special powers. Dropping supplies and vehicles on top of enemies was hysterical as well. 
        I remember seeing a supply drop come in and always landing on top of a building at Karkand
Oh no. Someone is playing the game in a way he has fun and not how you like it. Better teamkill him.
By any means necessary. 

If I have to die with em it's fine, knowing they won't kill me from that same spot is worth my death.
    The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
Slipping and dying? 
    You can only do it once, but man is it sexy 
I dont think so actually. To me it still seems just as powerful.
Ironically they actually nerfed the Russians RoF. 
    Aww i loved that gun
        its still great, dont worry. I barely even noticed the change.
Hopefully they don't nerf it. Martini Henry is a great example of a really fun gun that requires real skill to use it to its full effect. I think DICE got it right with this one.
    It doesn't take much skill really 
    I seem to remember something about a nerf in the patch notes.
I 'member.

The ragdoll scream at the end had me dying. 
Ahh ok, never heard of 9gag but yeah.. what ever
    I will try to clarify for you.


Basically, there is this cesspool of cancer called 9gag, similar to reddit, but instead, the community is more toxic, more reposty, and most hot posts are admin mosts that have generated upvotes. retards just farm upvotes over their for nooooo reason by posting their reactions, like 
>Came here to write this

>Idk how I feel about this.

Etc.

TL;DR, 9Gag is the cancer of internet.
        Sorry mate, never heard of it. Sounds shit btw.. I'll avoid it if ai can. Thanks for the heads up. 
            yeah, sorry for assuming...
                No wukkers, see you on the battlefield. 
i keep trying. im like 1/100.  i always just barely miss sticking the landing.
Truely golden at one point. Had to abanfon it too. Smh
Yeah man, two will destroy anything, one will do serious damage.
    That's better than the dynamite.  2 on a tank and it's disabled and barely destroyed.  
I've not really used scout much, but is it possible to avoid that scope glare? I feel like I barely see then anymore.
    Iron sights = no glare.
        Pretty sure the marksman version doesn't have glare either.
            Best of both worlds with only a fraction of the disadvantages that the Infantry and the Sniper have to deal with.
                What's the infantry disadvantage? 
                    no zoomy zoomy makes for less shooty shooty
        Go full Simo Hayha (I never spell his last name right fight me) on them. 

Seriously iron sights plus the periscope and you're good to go.
