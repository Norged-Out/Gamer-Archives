[[Field manual on how to survive tank attacks]]





only compatable with light tanks
    Well of course. Landships and Heavies can't shake their heads back. This frustrates them and causes them to shoot you in anger.
        I thought it was common knowledge that Landships and Heavies see head shaking as a sign of aggression?
            I'm pretty sure they don't enter enclosed circles.
                just make sure you aren't screeching like a chimpanzee
                    But this method works *EXTREMELY* well in bar fights.
                I believe those are actually seatanks you're thinking of 
                    Correct and you *have* to make a circle, **NOT** an oval.
            Heavy tanks and landships are assholes. Light tanks actually have a personality 
                As a heavy tanker, this is 100% accurate. 
                    Also Heavy Tanker. I went 40-0 yesterday capturing and defending flags and I dont understand the "A good team will take down a tank in seconds" or the "Here I had the choice for a monster and I chose the piddly little cardboard cut out of a cartoon tank".  

What is the advantage of a light tank? They pose no threat to me when I am tanking, and with the rocket gun are easily destroyed when I am assault. Which leads me on to my next (first?) point which is it's never a good opposition that kills a tank it's bad decision making by the driver.

                            This is one of the most fun experiences for me in tank combat.
                            What if they see you coming from range? The only problem I have is when I don't watch the flow of a game and end up surrounded
                                You hook them. They think they will have it easy so they usually follow you. You must find something to drive around and to cover you so he has to move to shoot you. Meanwhile you drop mines on your way and make sure he has to keep following you. Then, BOOM.
                                    The mines are the real equalizers. 
                                    Mines are brutal if you don't steer clear of the main choke points. Learnt that the hard way.
                        the howitzer.
                            I know that it got nerfed for being too accurate, but does it have an advantage over the main cannon on a heavy? Does it have better reload etc?
                                

Reload slower bullet drop heavy but it does 40dmg to heavy tank
                                    That and the mines and ability to fire at range that is less accurate for the heavy if you are good with it.
                                    Is that 2 shots to disable? That's good
            Just dont look into its eyes!

        Lady and Gentlemen the David Attenborough of Tanks.
        I'll kill any of you in a heavy tank!
    I've always seen light tanks as having a personality - they look quite cute for the most part
        They're like twingos with a gun
            Well they are both Renaults
        They're ducks.
            Witches? 
                BURN THEM!
                    She turned me into a newt!
                        ....I got better
                        I got better...
        I find the A7V cuter. The boxy boxiness boxness of it makes it look vulnerable and sometimes confused.

Which of course makes me giggle whenever I make it panic  and wiggle around like a mentally crippled turtle before getting killed because I missed my rocket shot.
            "mentally crippled turtle" is also the perfect description for a heavy tank that's fallen on its side
            Chicks "giggle" ...guys "laugh"
    As a heavy tanker whenever I try to do this they throw a grenade at me. I've been broken and trust no one
    Light tanks have heart and empathy, heavies are ruthless killing machines hell bent on destruction 
        And every land ship is called Steve. Just Steve 
            HEY!  STEVE!
            Makes sense.  As a genuine Steve myself, the tank hunter landship is my favorite tank.  Although the Light Flanker is a close second.
                Landships are also adorable in the youre way too slow to catch me way
    Nah, I've done it with an AV7 before. I was running from him and he had me right in his sights, clear line of fire. I was close to death, so I decided "fuck it", and turned around shaking my head frantically before I kept running. I survived, so he either A) got distracted by a closer and more dangerous target, B) understood me and had mercy on me, or C) was a really bad shot. Most likely A or B.
        If it was me in that AV7, then it was probably C.
    Heavy tanks are a slightly [different approach](http://xboxdvr.com/gamer/EA705/video/25471326) 
    [Can confirm it is effective against modern tanks too](https://streamable.com/2a0yh)
I tried this today. He thought about it for a second, then ran me over.
    At least you tried.
    He clearly remembers Steamboat Willie and thought better of it.
    It's not about winning. It's about having fun. 
Is that tank made using only letters??
    Holy shit I think you're right.  What the fuck?
        apparently it was a game key for BF1
            [deleted]
                I think it's an O with an s inside. 
    I need to know why!
        Because the person who made the comic used Google Image search to find a picture of a tank in the right style, and that letters one came up first.
        https://redd.it/59lt4v 
        Ain't nothing but a heart ache
    Not only letters, but they used quite a few.
        Rear wheel looks like theta even...
     yup. I tracked down the source: http://n810l3.deviantart.com/art/Renault-Ft-17-Light-tank-496479509

he also did the Japanese Type-95 tank in this style http://n810l3.deviantart.com/art/Type-95-Ha-Go-light-tank-495972913 
        Good job. But.... why lol
            seems like the guy who made it liked to play world of tanks and one of the caption on the image is: "I've been bored so I "drew" one of my favorite light tank." I think that should fill all the plot holes.
                damn, i was hoping it was some kind of art style using typesetting i never heard of. boring.
                    oh if you want art made of letters there's thousands of it. it's called [typography](https://www.google.com/search?q=typography+art&safe=off&tbm=isch). Enjoy!
    Im almost tempted to highlight them to show other people. But I dont have the want, need, or time to do that
    You mean like ASCII? Doesn't look like it :)

I do see the letters though.

Can confirm this doesn't work on xbox
    As a tanker on Xbox I have yet to encounter anyone doing this but if it happens ill be sure to extend the courtesy and let them live. Most of my encounters are people shooting normal bullets at me, I never show mercy to these people because I assume there fresh from hardline and haven't caught on.
        Bless your soul. I just get blown away when I do this on XB. 


I like it when people shoot normal bullets at me when I'm flying. Yeah it does a little damage, but it also really helps me spot infantry and then take them out on the next pass. 
            Last time I fired at a plane, I destroyed it with my Hellriegel.

So naturally, I'm going to waste no less than 100 rounds per life shooting at planes from now on.
                That's seriously badass, I love the Hellriegel and it's my main weapon. But, that plane must've been severely weakened; I have nearly 40 service stars with the attack plane and have never been brought down by any weapon carried by infantry, aside for one time a guy caught a headshot on me with a really nice shot from the SMLE infantry.


The worst my plane takes is usually on a low pass ~3 players simultaneously shoot me with LMGs and I might get 30 damage. And I fly pretty low and risky for the most part. But tbf if a squad concentrated on a low passing plane, you could definitely take down a plane with full health. 
                    It definitely was. I've never done more than 10 damage to a plane by myself. I have found that the Tankgewehr will do ~30 damage to a plane, although I haven't taken one down with it.

And 40 service stars, awesome. I have a lot of fun with attack planes but I'm still figuring out how to aim bombs well.
                        Man I fucking love the attack plane, it's my bread 'n butter. If you're flying low and slow you can pretty much just aim directly between the lines of the bomb cam sights, but more speed and altitude requires you to "lead" the target a bit and takes some getting used to. Some guys say they don't even use the bomb cam, but I do every time. 


Honestly finding the little bastards (infantry) is half the battle. But I get a lot of multi kills just blindly bombing contested objs, or just knowing maps and where infantry clusters. 
                            I adore the attack plane too. The standard version is so versatile. You can blast other planes to bits if you sneak up on them. The flares will turn the tide of battle at a flag for the chaps on the ground, and the bombs can finish a tank. Strafing too is awesome fun, especially when someone spots a sniper on a perch somewhere.
                                Default loadout of the attack plane FTW. I've messed around with the other planes/loadouts and I always come back to the attack plane ground support. Those multi kill bomb drops are fucking satisfying too.


Snipers are a prime target for me when I'm flying, usually they're trying to take a pot shot at you so the scope glare gives them away even if they aren't spotted. Then they eat a round from my main MG as I'm making my next pass :D
                            I have gotten a pretty good feel for bombing in third person, but in the rare event my comrades on the ground have actually spotted some enemies, giving me a good target, I'll line it up with the bombsight to make sure it hits.
                                Sometimes if I'm coming in on a low and risky pass while lighting up my main MG, I might not bother to swap to bomb cam so that I don't hit the fucking ground. Other than that it's a bitch for me to land bombs in third person, but it'd be a handy skill for the reason stated above. While I was learning to bomb the ground I lost several planes by staying in the bomb cam too long.  
                                    I've found it helps to divebomb - you get a better view of the ground and can kind of see where the bombs are falling.  It also seems to drop the bombs in a smaller area, so you're more likely to get kills instead of hitmarkers (assuming you drop your bombs on target).  

With the bombsight it seems better to fly level, but that hasn't worked as well for me in the third person view as divebombing.
                    I wish I had gotten it on video but I took down a bomber with a mondragon storm once. Totally an accident but I shoot at every plane now just in case. 
                        That's awesome! I'd have loved to see that clip, bummer. I even saved a clip from the one time a scout caught me with a headshot in a plane because it was so sweet lol.  


The biggest threat to planes as a ground troop is directly killing the pilot with a headshot, and that's likely what you did unless the plane was down to very little health. I think I do ~3 dmg when I shoot at planes with the SMLE infantry/carbine. I play scout now and then and sometimes I try for that sweet headshot to a pilot. But I just miss and hit the fucking plane :/
                            If it ever happens again I'll make sure to send it to you!! It was definitely the plane though whole thing exploded and I thought it was a crazy coincidence until I got the vehicle destroyed points.

Keep trying with that SMLE it'll happen eventually I'm sure
                                No shit! That's crazy. Must have nailed the engine while it had low health or something, I think that's the only way it could happen? Either way that's cool as hell. 


And yeah I'm always taking pot shots at planes with my rifle bit at best I'll get a few damage points. Someday!
                    I've nailed a couple planes with my AT rifle. Although I've missed WAY more than I've ever hit
                        I hear that, I'm like 2/50 for hitting planes with my AT rocket gun lol. Never took one down, just did modest damage. Maybe they weren't solid hits, idk. 
                            Yeah that's probably what I'm at lol. Usually I wait until I'm on a flag and wait for bombers to come straight at me on a pass, that way I don't really have to lead them. Taken a few out with field guns that way too, that's always fun.
                                Haha yeah that's usually how I end up on the receiving end of this scenario. I'll be in the attack plane flying way too low and slow for a bomb run, and next thing I know I'm dead via blast from field gun/tank/arty truck.
                    A single LMG can do even 50 damage on a bomber if it's slow and close enough for a long burst.
                        I fly pretty low, slow and risky sometimes when I'm attempting precision bomb drops, receive ground fire regularly and I've never gotten that much damage in a pass. But, that's just my experience. Maybe I'm just playing against a bunch of dumbasses, idk. 
                    I think this is somewhat related to the discussion. [I managed to one shot an attack plane with the armored train's cannon-like turret.](http://xboxdvr.com/gamer/Vance079/video/25472320) I don't know if this is something common to happen, for I started playing a week ago, but it felt just nice!
                        I did it once with the field gun. I'll probably never be able to do it again.
                        Nice shot! I have many hours in the attack plane and have only been brought down maybe 6-7 times by ground weapons of any sort, and I've never done it personally. Not super common, but it does happen. I'm sure that was super satisfying.
                    MG15 here, I just shoot at you fuckers all day long. Then I run Assault just yesterday, have a plane flying over head so I shoot it with my shotgun and I get the "Vehicle Disabled."

Kind of pissed, kind of interested. 
                        Old thread resurrection! MG15 is the best if you're going to do it.


Yesterday I finished off a plane with the Martini-Henry and it felt real nice. 
            I only do it when the AAs have been disabled or otherwise unavailable. I'll set up prone with a telescopic bar, far enough away from the actual multiple squad assault going on that the plane will focus on me and waste the bombs/flares on me instead of smashing my team.

So far I have disabled one plane, shot out one pilot and died a fuck load of times. Doesn't help my stats but sure helps my team.
                Yeah that's not a bad way if going about it, sometimes I do waste my time trying to get one guy shooting at me and it certainly does me away from the action. Honestly any annoyance you can create on a pilot ultimately helps your team. 


But to my original point, if you're standing among 5-6 of your teammates and shoot at my plane for a second, best believe I'm going for that sweet 5-6x  multi-kill bomb drop now that I know where you guys are haha.
                I do admire people who do this and I have seen a couple of support guys together drive off a good bomber. 
            Unless it is from a support gun, in which case, the lewis and m1909 can take planes down in a clip
                From full health? From my experience they arent quite that damaging, but I'd love to be proven wrong. Also distance would become an issue pretty fast, conditions would have to be just right and a very good shooter.


If I ever get taken down solely by infantry primary weapons I'll be sure to post the clip. 
            I always shoot planes with my LMG.  I never do a huge amount of damage but I know that sort of thing is annoying when I'm a pilot, so when I'm on the ground I figure I might as well.
            Well yeah plans makes sense they were wood and canvas so bullets should damage them
        What about hardline?
            In hardline normal bullets can damage pretty much every vehicle so I'm assuming people still think it's a game mechanic and are learning the hard way that its not.
                Even tanks?
                    There are no tanks in hardline
                        Oh
            Hardline vehicles are damaged by gunfire
                Oh, thanks
        It happened to me once. I didn't process what he was doing until 5 seconds after I disintigrated him with my main cannon. 
        I've tried it a few times ha, it doesn't work 
    On overwatch I get away with it sometimes on 1v1s I know I'll lose. 
        Get out. 
Btw everybody this is purely a PC phenomenon in case you didnt know. XB1 You shake your head and six squad mates spawn on you, 5 die and 1 revives everyone for a solid 2k kill for the tank to finish.
    Xbox sensitivity is usually pretty low so it's hard to get your head to shake. Plus the general population is younger so they don't care
        What about those using a xim4?  It allows keyboard/mouse control on consoles. 
            if you're going to use a pc/m to play a shooter on console you might as well play on pc, im sure the amount of people that use this thing is very, very, very, very small.
                But then you wouldn't have an incredible advantage over your peers. 
                    being able to move your character and adjust your aim simultaneously gives you an advantage over 75% of this game's population so anything else is kind of irrelevant 
                I play on both actually. Sometimes the cost of upgrading can be a setback so in my times of need I use my xb1.  
            I pretty sure the mouse just simulates controller joystick movement, at least on ps4
                That's the way I understand it. 
            You're still restricted to the capped sensitivity of the game. 
            I personally consider it cheating 
                So would a steering wheel on console be cheating vs controller?  It's only adding on peripherals not adding aim bots or changing the code. 
                    A steering wheel or rockband controller are peripherals supported natively on console and the developers of those games design the game with that in mind. Keyboard and mouse give players a clear edge in aim and even worse, the console aim assist makes it incredibly easy. A player using a mouse on console is a workaround, not a peripheral. They trick the console into thinking it's a controller, and it gives a clear advantage to the user. Luckily they are still pricy and not a widespread issue, but if they were more widely used then I would hope something would be done about them. Now if Microsoft or a game developer released their own kb+m and designed there game to balance it with controllers, that would be a different story. 
                Thats because it is cheating
Holy poop that was me!

 You'll have better luck if you shake your head side-to-side for "no" instead of up and down for "yes".
    Technically up and down would be nodding not shaking, the picture is all sorts of messed up

Thanks for the game key hidden in the tank. Really smart
    If you've already used it, what was it? The rear wheel thing doesn't look like a letter to me
Can this be used if ANY one sees you laying on the ground. It's fucking hard to stay hidden. At the end of each round I see that I'm the only one that has 20 kills but 19 deaths? Anyone else?
Thank you so much for this helpful guide. I was lost before.
As someone who has never played BF1 what's this all about? 
    There is a craze at the moment to plead with the tanker for your life when you are cornered and alone.
[60% of the time - it works every time.](https://youtu.be/pjvQFtlNQ-M)
    That doesn't make any sense. 
        see the edit I made to the original comment. 
Don't forget to say "tanks" when he leaves
Yesterday on Suez I came across a Scout, spared him despite him harassing me earlier with K Bullets. The only reason I have shown clemency was because of his location, i was at the frontline basically facing the enemies behind the dunes, and he was on his team's frontline being active and not nesting somewhere across the map. He tried to escape but I pinned him down between my tank and my team, he then proceeded to aggressively shake his head, and I went on to take care of a couple assaults who were harassing me.

I racked 36-0 in that game with the majority of it from nesting snipers outside the map.
Disclaimer: this only has 20% chance of success due to the insane bloodlust of most players. 
Man may outsmart me, but I have not yet met man who can outsmart bullet
For Indian tanks, shake head side to side
I feel the need to print this out, frame it, and go hang it in a random war exhibit when no ones looking
Instructions unclear, shook my head up and down and now I'm dead.
If you bastards just stop shooting at me and my friends I won't have to kill you. (Level ten heavy tanker)
I've been bamboozled again!
whats with shaking the head tho?
    It's like gesturing "don't"
        But the arrows go up and down which is nodding yes not shaking no

Literally unplayable
Codex unlocked. 
Spelled unaggressively incorrectly. I'm calling fake!
    Also put arrows for nodding yes instead of shaking no
Artillery trucks are completely unpredictable in this regard.
Tried this on PlayStation.. confirmed that they don't give a shit and still kill you
I actually have a world war one manual and it says pretty much the same as this. 
Works every time
I just crawl under them and set a charge.
So this is why i died. I didn't go prone. My lil brother asked me "dude why the fuck did you just stand there and shake your gun back and forth?"
only noobs do this correct way is crouch slide left and right si its harder to hit you.
Can confirm this works on PS4 40% of the time.
Only ever works with F-17s?
    Yes Landships can't shake their heads back. This frustrates them and causes them to shoot you in anger. Heavies are just dicks
        I had the funniest thing happen yesterday with a heavy on ballroom blitz. I was a medic on foot, capped A and was heading to D on the left side when one showed up (driver was the only one in the tank) and he spotted me but wasn't fast or accurate enough enough to get me with his first shot so I rushed him. I stayed on either side or behind him and because the main gun only has a 35¬∞ field of view he could never get his main gun on me to take a shot. I danced with him for at least 3 minutes while my three friends in my party capped E and defended it. When I saw they died advised them to spawn on me with dynamite. It was so amazingly ridiculous. 
Light tank is the worst example to pick. If you're an assault, you can easily beat it. Throw both AT grenades in quick succession and you're already halfway there, follow that up with an incendiary and you should only need one AT rocket to finish the job. 
To be honest i will kill you, i will wait for some medic revives you and then i will kill all of you again.

I dont have soul, sorry.
How do you even aggressively shake your head ??
No one I've come across on PS4 do this. If you don't shake your head, I'm blasting your face with the shotgun on the heavy tank and going about my day
I read "how to survive shark tank attacks" .. and I thought to myself, why would anyone go in a tank with a hungry shark?
Sorry im still going to kill you. Because WAR.
Heavy tanker here. I would very slowly try to run you over. It's too risky to leave anything alive behind me when it takes half the match to turn around. Besides the gunners will probably shoot at you anyway. 
1.) Lie down

our make you into a pancake 
Due to the extremely wide and flexible third person view that sees everything, you cant hide from tanks. Whereas you could in BF4. You just cant in this game. DICE really  needs to address this. 
I tried this and the tank sat for a second and then shot and killed me :(
I'm so completely confused by this. Granted I'm not a big online shooter guy but I played a few of the old battlefields and some CoD back in the day. Why wouldn't the tank kill him? It's the whole object of the game. And can't the dude who gets saved come back and kill you? Plus don't the kills help you get more points for leveling and stuff? I'm not knocking it or anything I just can't fathom how this happens.
    Cause it's funny. 

9 times out of 10, it's a scout that finds himself face to face 1 on 1 with a tank. Scouts have no AT capabilities except a light AT grenade if they're packing it over a frag or one of the others. Even then, his 1 grenade won't kill the tank from full health.

It's a guaranteed kill for the tanker so the wagging back and forth amuses and entertains the savage metal beast and buys the soldier some mercy.

Only works with light tanks though. Heavy tankers are just dicks. üòÇ
        Can confirm.


am heavy tanker and I kill everything
        What about K ammo?
            They do 5 damage and you get 4 shots. 
        Okay this makes a bit more sense when you put it this way.

        Are tanks that OP?
            It's a tank vs a guy with a rifle.. Yes..
                I mean relative to other games with tanks. There's tanks in older battlefields but I've never heard of this, at least not widespread.
                    All the post means is that when you are 1v1 with a tank, try going prone and shakin your head for mercy since it works sometimes and you have nothing to lose really since they will generally kill you. A tank vs infantry 1 on 1 is generally favored to the tank, but tanks are probably the weakest they've ever been in this game since a single assault can easily take one down if he has some decent cover or people distracting the tank. . 
                        Can confirm, mines destroy anything
I did this. The driver got out of the tank to beat me to death
Well of course. Landships and Heavies can't shake their heads back. This frustrates them and causes them to shoot you in anger.
    I thought it was common knowledge that Landships and Heavies see head shaking as a sign of aggression?
        I'm pretty sure they don't enter enclosed circles.
            just make sure you aren't screeching like a chimpanzee
                But this method works *EXTREMELY* well in bar fights.
            I believe those are actually seatanks you're thinking of 
                Correct and you *have* to make a circle, **NOT** an oval.
        Heavy tanks and landships are assholes. Light tanks actually have a personality 
            As a heavy tanker, this is 100% accurate. 
                Also Heavy Tanker. I went 40-0 yesterday capturing and defending flags and I dont understand the "A good team will take down a tank in seconds" or the "Here I had the choice for a monster and I chose the piddly little cardboard cut out of a cartoon tank".  

What is the advantage of a light tank? They pose no threat to me when I am tanking, and with the rocket gun are easily destroyed when I am assault. Which leads me on to my next (first?) point which is it's never a good opposition that kills a tank it's bad decision making by the driver.

                        This is one of the most fun experiences for me in tank combat.
                        What if they see you coming from range? The only problem I have is when I don't watch the flow of a game and end up surrounded
                            You hook them. They think they will have it easy so they usually follow you. You must find something to drive around and to cover you so he has to move to shoot you. Meanwhile you drop mines on your way and make sure he has to keep following you. Then, BOOM.
                                The mines are the real equalizers. 
                                Mines are brutal if you don't steer clear of the main choke points. Learnt that the hard way.
                    the howitzer.
                        I know that it got nerfed for being too accurate, but does it have an advantage over the main cannon on a heavy? Does it have better reload etc?
                            

Reload slower bullet drop heavy but it does 40dmg to heavy tank
                                That and the mines and ability to fire at range that is less accurate for the heavy if you are good with it.
                                Is that 2 shots to disable? That's good
        Just dont look into its eyes!

I've always seen light tanks as having a personality - they look quite cute for the most part
    They're like twingos with a gun
        Well they are both Renaults
    They're ducks.

    I find the A7V cuter. The boxy boxiness boxness of it makes it look vulnerable and sometimes confused.

Which of course makes me giggle whenever I make it panic  and wiggle around like a mentally crippled turtle before getting killed because I missed my rocket shot.
        "mentally crippled turtle" is also the perfect description for a heavy tank that's fallen on its side
        Chicks "giggle" ...guys "laugh"
As a heavy tanker whenever I try to do this they throw a grenade at me. I've been broken and trust no one
Light tanks have heart and empathy, heavies are ruthless killing machines hell bent on destruction 
    And every land ship is called Steve. Just Steve 
        HEY!  STEVE!
        Makes sense.  As a genuine Steve myself, the tank hunter landship is my favorite tank.  Although the Light Flanker is a close second.
            Landships are also adorable in the youre way too slow to catch me way
Nah, I've done it with an AV7 before. I was running from him and he had me right in his sights, clear line of fire. I was close to death, so I decided "fuck it", and turned around shaking my head frantically before I kept running. I survived, so he either A) got distracted by a closer and more dangerous target, B) understood me and had mercy on me, or C) was a really bad shot. Most likely A or B.
    If it was me in that AV7, then it was probably C.
Heavy tanks are a slightly [different approach](http://xboxdvr.com/gamer/EA705/video/25471326)

 yup. I tracked down the source: http://n810l3.deviantart.com/art/Renault-Ft-17-Light-tank-496479509

he also did the Japanese Type-95 tank in this style http://n810l3.deviantart.com/art/Type-95-Ha-Go-light-tank-495972913 
    Good job. But.... why lol
        seems like the guy who made it liked to play world of tanks and one of the caption on the image is: "I've been bored so I "drew" one of my favorite light tank." I think that should fill all the plot holes.
            damn, i was hoping it was some kind of art style using typesetting i never heard of. boring.
                oh if you want art made of letters there's thousands of it. it's called [typography](https://www.google.com/search?q=typography+art&safe=off&tbm=isch). Enjoy!
Im almost tempted to highlight them to show other people. But I dont have the want, need, or time to do that
You mean like ASCII? Doesn't look like it :)

As a tanker on Xbox I have yet to encounter anyone doing this but if it happens ill be sure to extend the courtesy and let them live. Most of my encounters are people shooting normal bullets at me, I never show mercy to these people because I assume there fresh from hardline and haven't caught on.
    Bless your soul. I just get blown away when I do this on XB. 


I like it when people shoot normal bullets at me when I'm flying. Yeah it does a little damage, but it also really helps me spot infantry and then take them out on the next pass. 
        Last time I fired at a plane, I destroyed it with my Hellriegel.

So naturally, I'm going to waste no less than 100 rounds per life shooting at planes from now on.
            That's seriously badass, I love the Hellriegel and it's my main weapon. But, that plane must've been severely weakened; I have nearly 40 service stars with the attack plane and have never been brought down by any weapon carried by infantry, aside for one time a guy caught a headshot on me with a really nice shot from the SMLE infantry.


The worst my plane takes is usually on a low pass ~3 players simultaneously shoot me with LMGs and I might get 30 damage. And I fly pretty low and risky for the most part. But tbf if a squad concentrated on a low passing plane, you could definitely take down a plane with full health. 
                It definitely was. I've never done more than 10 damage to a plane by myself. I have found that the Tankgewehr will do ~30 damage to a plane, although I haven't taken one down with it.

And 40 service stars, awesome. I have a lot of fun with attack planes but I'm still figuring out how to aim bombs well.
                    Man I fucking love the attack plane, it's my bread 'n butter. If you're flying low and slow you can pretty much just aim directly between the lines of the bomb cam sights, but more speed and altitude requires you to "lead" the target a bit and takes some getting used to. Some guys say they don't even use the bomb cam, but I do every time. 


Honestly finding the little bastards (infantry) is half the battle. But I get a lot of multi kills just blindly bombing contested objs, or just knowing maps and where infantry clusters. 
                        I adore the attack plane too. The standard version is so versatile. You can blast other planes to bits if you sneak up on them. The flares will turn the tide of battle at a flag for the chaps on the ground, and the bombs can finish a tank. Strafing too is awesome fun, especially when someone spots a sniper on a perch somewhere.
                            Default loadout of the attack plane FTW. I've messed around with the other planes/loadouts and I always come back to the attack plane ground support. Those multi kill bomb drops are fucking satisfying too.


Snipers are a prime target for me when I'm flying, usually they're trying to take a pot shot at you so the scope glare gives them away even if they aren't spotted. Then they eat a round from my main MG as I'm making my next pass :D
                        I have gotten a pretty good feel for bombing in third person, but in the rare event my comrades on the ground have actually spotted some enemies, giving me a good target, I'll line it up with the bombsight to make sure it hits.
                            Sometimes if I'm coming in on a low and risky pass while lighting up my main MG, I might not bother to swap to bomb cam so that I don't hit the fucking ground. Other than that it's a bitch for me to land bombs in third person, but it'd be a handy skill for the reason stated above. While I was learning to bomb the ground I lost several planes by staying in the bomb cam too long.  
                                I've found it helps to divebomb - you get a better view of the ground and can kind of see where the bombs are falling.  It also seems to drop the bombs in a smaller area, so you're more likely to get kills instead of hitmarkers (assuming you drop your bombs on target).  

With the bombsight it seems better to fly level, but that hasn't worked as well for me in the third person view as divebombing.
                I wish I had gotten it on video but I took down a bomber with a mondragon storm once. Totally an accident but I shoot at every plane now just in case. 
                    That's awesome! I'd have loved to see that clip, bummer. I even saved a clip from the one time a scout caught me with a headshot in a plane because it was so sweet lol.  


The biggest threat to planes as a ground troop is directly killing the pilot with a headshot, and that's likely what you did unless the plane was down to very little health. I think I do ~3 dmg when I shoot at planes with the SMLE infantry/carbine. I play scout now and then and sometimes I try for that sweet headshot to a pilot. But I just miss and hit the fucking plane :/
                        If it ever happens again I'll make sure to send it to you!! It was definitely the plane though whole thing exploded and I thought it was a crazy coincidence until I got the vehicle destroyed points.

Keep trying with that SMLE it'll happen eventually I'm sure
                            No shit! That's crazy. Must have nailed the engine while it had low health or something, I think that's the only way it could happen? Either way that's cool as hell. 


And yeah I'm always taking pot shots at planes with my rifle bit at best I'll get a few damage points. Someday!
                I've nailed a couple planes with my AT rifle. Although I've missed WAY more than I've ever hit
                    I hear that, I'm like 2/50 for hitting planes with my AT rocket gun lol. Never took one down, just did modest damage. Maybe they weren't solid hits, idk. 
                        Yeah that's probably what I'm at lol. Usually I wait until I'm on a flag and wait for bombers to come straight at me on a pass, that way I don't really have to lead them. Taken a few out with field guns that way too, that's always fun.
                            Haha yeah that's usually how I end up on the receiving end of this scenario. I'll be in the attack plane flying way too low and slow for a bomb run, and next thing I know I'm dead via blast from field gun/tank/arty truck.
                A single LMG can do even 50 damage on a bomber if it's slow and close enough for a long burst.
                    I fly pretty low, slow and risky sometimes when I'm attempting precision bomb drops, receive ground fire regularly and I've never gotten that much damage in a pass. But, that's just my experience. Maybe I'm just playing against a bunch of dumbasses, idk. 
                I think this is somewhat related to the discussion. [I managed to one shot an attack plane with the armored train's cannon-like turret.](http://xboxdvr.com/gamer/Vance079/video/25472320) I don't know if this is something common to happen, for I started playing a week ago, but it felt just nice!
                    I did it once with the field gun. I'll probably never be able to do it again.
                    Nice shot! I have many hours in the attack plane and have only been brought down maybe 6-7 times by ground weapons of any sort, and I've never done it personally. Not super common, but it does happen. I'm sure that was super satisfying.
                MG15 here, I just shoot at you fuckers all day long. Then I run Assault just yesterday, have a plane flying over head so I shoot it with my shotgun and I get the "Vehicle Disabled."

Kind of pissed, kind of interested. 
                    Old thread resurrection! MG15 is the best if you're going to do it.


Yesterday I finished off a plane with the Martini-Henry and it felt real nice. 
        I only do it when the AAs have been disabled or otherwise unavailable. I'll set up prone with a telescopic bar, far enough away from the actual multiple squad assault going on that the plane will focus on me and waste the bombs/flares on me instead of smashing my team.

So far I have disabled one plane, shot out one pilot and died a fuck load of times. Doesn't help my stats but sure helps my team.
            Yeah that's not a bad way if going about it, sometimes I do waste my time trying to get one guy shooting at me and it certainly does me away from the action. Honestly any annoyance you can create on a pilot ultimately helps your team. 


But to my original point, if you're standing among 5-6 of your teammates and shoot at my plane for a second, best believe I'm going for that sweet 5-6x  multi-kill bomb drop now that I know where you guys are haha.
            I do admire people who do this and I have seen a couple of support guys together drive off a good bomber. 
        Unless it is from a support gun, in which case, the lewis and m1909 can take planes down in a clip
            From full health? From my experience they arent quite that damaging, but I'd love to be proven wrong. Also distance would become an issue pretty fast, conditions would have to be just right and a very good shooter.


If I ever get taken down solely by infantry primary weapons I'll be sure to post the clip. 
        I always shoot planes with my LMG.  I never do a huge amount of damage but I know that sort of thing is annoying when I'm a pilot, so when I'm on the ground I figure I might as well.
        Well yeah plans makes sense they were wood and canvas so bullets should damage them
    What about hardline?
        In hardline normal bullets can damage pretty much every vehicle so I'm assuming people still think it's a game mechanic and are learning the hard way that its not.
            Even tanks?
                There are no tanks in hardline
                    Oh
        Hardline vehicles are damaged by gunfire
            Oh, thanks
    It happened to me once. I didn't process what he was doing until 5 seconds after I disintigrated him with my main cannon. 
    I've tried it a few times ha, it doesn't work 
On overwatch I get away with it sometimes on 1v1s I know I'll lose. 
    Get out. 
Xbox sensitivity is usually pretty low so it's hard to get your head to shake. Plus the general population is younger so they don't care
    What about those using a xim4?  It allows keyboard/mouse control on consoles. 
        if you're going to use a pc/m to play a shooter on console you might as well play on pc, im sure the amount of people that use this thing is very, very, very, very small.
            But then you wouldn't have an incredible advantage over your peers. 
                being able to move your character and adjust your aim simultaneously gives you an advantage over 75% of this game's population so anything else is kind of irrelevant 
            I play on both actually. Sometimes the cost of upgrading can be a setback so in my times of need I use my xb1.  
        I pretty sure the mouse just simulates controller joystick movement, at least on ps4
            That's the way I understand it. 
        You're still restricted to the capped sensitivity of the game. 
        I personally consider it cheating 
            So would a steering wheel on console be cheating vs controller?  It's only adding on peripherals not adding aim bots or changing the code. 
                A steering wheel or rockband controller are peripherals supported natively on console and the developers of those games design the game with that in mind. Keyboard and mouse give players a clear edge in aim and even worse, the console aim assist makes it incredibly easy. A player using a mouse on console is a workaround, not a peripheral. They trick the console into thinking it's a controller, and it gives a clear advantage to the user. Luckily they are still pricy and not a widespread issue, but if they were more widely used then I would hope something would be done about them. Now if Microsoft or a game developer released their own kb+m and designed there game to balance it with controllers, that would be a different story. 
            Thats because it is cheating
Me too! https://redd.it/59lt4v

There is a craze at the moment to plead with the tanker for your life when you are cornered and alone.
That doesn't make any sense. 
    see the edit I made to the original comment. 
It's like gesturing "don't"
    But the arrows go up and down which is nodding yes not shaking no

Literally unplayable
Also put arrows for nodding yes instead of shaking no
Yes Landships can't shake their heads back. This frustrates them and causes them to shoot you in anger. Heavies are just dicks
    I had the funniest thing happen yesterday with a heavy on ballroom blitz. I was a medic on foot, capped A and was heading to D on the left side when one showed up (driver was the only one in the tank) and he spotted me but wasn't fast or accurate enough enough to get me with his first shot so I rushed him. I stayed on either side or behind him and because the main gun only has a 35¬∞ field of view he could never get his main gun on me to take a shot. I danced with him for at least 3 minutes while my three friends in my party capped E and defended it. When I saw they died advised them to spawn on me with dynamite. It was so amazingly ridiculous. 
Cause it's funny. 

9 times out of 10, it's a scout that finds himself face to face 1 on 1 with a tank. Scouts have no AT capabilities except a light AT grenade if they're packing it over a frag or one of the others. Even then, his 1 grenade won't kill the tank from full health.

It's a guaranteed kill for the tanker so the wagging back and forth amuses and entertains the savage metal beast and buys the soldier some mercy.

Only works with light tanks though. Heavy tankers are just dicks. üòÇ
    Can confirm.

        They do 5 damage and you get 4 shots.

                        You hook them. They think they will have it easy so they usually follow you. You must find something to drive around and to cover you so he has to move to shoot you. Meanwhile you drop mines on your way and make sure he has to keep following you. Then, BOOM.
                            The mines are the real equalizers. 
                            Mines are brutal if you don't steer clear of the main choke points. Learnt that the hard way.
                the howitzer.
                    I know that it got nerfed for being too accurate, but does it have an advantage over the main cannon on a heavy? Does it have better reload etc?
                        

Reload slower bullet drop heavy but it does 40dmg to heavy tank
                            That and the mines and ability to fire at range that is less accurate for the heavy if you are good with it.
                            Is that 2 shots to disable? That's good
    Just dont look into its eyes!

I'll kill any of you in a heavy tank!
They're like twingos with a gun
    Well they are both Renaults
They're ducks.

I find the A7V cuter. The boxy boxiness boxness of it makes it look vulnerable and sometimes confused.

Which of course makes me giggle whenever I make it panic  and wiggle around like a mentally crippled turtle before getting killed because I missed my rocket shot.
    "mentally crippled turtle" is also the perfect description for a heavy tank that's fallen on its side
    Chicks "giggle" ...guys "laugh"
And every land ship is called Steve. Just Steve 
    HEY!  STEVE!
    Makes sense.  As a genuine Steve myself, the tank hunter landship is my favorite tank.  Although the Light Flanker is a close second.
        Landships are also adorable in the youre way too slow to catch me way
If it was me in that AV7, then it was probably C.
apparently it was a game key for BF1

        I think it's an O with an s inside. 
Because the person who made the comic used Google Image search to find a picture of a tank in the right style, and that letters one came up first.

Ain't nothing but a heart ache
Rear wheel looks like theta even...
Good job. But.... why lol
    seems like the guy who made it liked to play world of tanks and one of the caption on the image is: "I've been bored so I "drew" one of my favorite light tank." I think that should fill all the plot holes.
        damn, i was hoping it was some kind of art style using typesetting i never heard of. boring.
            oh if you want art made of letters there's thousands of it. it's called [typography](https://www.google.com/search?q=typography+art&safe=off&tbm=isch). Enjoy!
Bless your soul. I just get blown away when I do this on XB. 


I like it when people shoot normal bullets at me when I'm flying. Yeah it does a little damage, but it also really helps me spot infantry and then take them out on the next pass. 
    Last time I fired at a plane, I destroyed it with my Hellriegel.

So naturally, I'm going to waste no less than 100 rounds per life shooting at planes from now on.
        That's seriously badass, I love the Hellriegel and it's my main weapon. But, that plane must've been severely weakened; I have nearly 40 service stars with the attack plane and have never been brought down by any weapon carried by infantry, aside for one time a guy caught a headshot on me with a really nice shot from the SMLE infantry.


The worst my plane takes is usually on a low pass ~3 players simultaneously shoot me with LMGs and I might get 30 damage. And I fly pretty low and risky for the most part. But tbf if a squad concentrated on a low passing plane, you could definitely take down a plane with full health. 
            It definitely was. I've never done more than 10 damage to a plane by myself. I have found that the Tankgewehr will do ~30 damage to a plane, although I haven't taken one down with it.

And 40 service stars, awesome. I have a lot of fun with attack planes but I'm still figuring out how to aim bombs well.
                Man I fucking love the attack plane, it's my bread 'n butter. If you're flying low and slow you can pretty much just aim directly between the lines of the bomb cam sights, but more speed and altitude requires you to "lead" the target a bit and takes some getting used to. Some guys say they don't even use the bomb cam, but I do every time. 


Honestly finding the little bastards (infantry) is half the battle. But I get a lot of multi kills just blindly bombing contested objs, or just knowing maps and where infantry clusters. 
                    I adore the attack plane too. The standard version is so versatile. You can blast other planes to bits if you sneak up on them. The flares will turn the tide of battle at a flag for the chaps on the ground, and the bombs can finish a tank. Strafing too is awesome fun, especially when someone spots a sniper on a perch somewhere.
                        Default loadout of the attack plane FTW. I've messed around with the other planes/loadouts and I always come back to the attack plane ground support. Those multi kill bomb drops are fucking satisfying too.


Snipers are a prime target for me when I'm flying, usually they're trying to take a pot shot at you so the scope glare gives them away even if they aren't spotted. Then they eat a round from my main MG as I'm making my next pass :D
                    I have gotten a pretty good feel for bombing in third person, but in the rare event my comrades on the ground have actually spotted some enemies, giving me a good target, I'll line it up with the bombsight to make sure it hits.
                        Sometimes if I'm coming in on a low and risky pass while lighting up my main MG, I might not bother to swap to bomb cam so that I don't hit the fucking ground. Other than that it's a bitch for me to land bombs in third person, but it'd be a handy skill for the reason stated above. While I was learning to bomb the ground I lost several planes by staying in the bomb cam too long.  
                            I've found it helps to divebomb - you get a better view of the ground and can kind of see where the bombs are falling.  It also seems to drop the bombs in a smaller area, so you're more likely to get kills instead of hitmarkers (assuming you drop your bombs on target).  

With the bombsight it seems better to fly level, but that hasn't worked as well for me in the third person view as divebombing.
            I wish I had gotten it on video but I took down a bomber with a mondragon storm once. Totally an accident but I shoot at every plane now just in case. 
                That's awesome! I'd have loved to see that clip, bummer. I even saved a clip from the one time a scout caught me with a headshot in a plane because it was so sweet lol.  


The biggest threat to planes as a ground troop is directly killing the pilot with a headshot, and that's likely what you did unless the plane was down to very little health. I think I do ~3 dmg when I shoot at planes with the SMLE infantry/carbine. I play scout now and then and sometimes I try for that sweet headshot to a pilot. But I just miss and hit the fucking plane :/
                    If it ever happens again I'll make sure to send it to you!! It was definitely the plane though whole thing exploded and I thought it was a crazy coincidence until I got the vehicle destroyed points.

Keep trying with that SMLE it'll happen eventually I'm sure
                        No shit! That's crazy. Must have nailed the engine while it had low health or something, I think that's the only way it could happen? Either way that's cool as hell. 


And yeah I'm always taking pot shots at planes with my rifle bit at best I'll get a few damage points. Someday!
            I've nailed a couple planes with my AT rifle. Although I've missed WAY more than I've ever hit
                I hear that, I'm like 2/50 for hitting planes with my AT rocket gun lol. Never took one down, just did modest damage. Maybe they weren't solid hits, idk. 
                    Yeah that's probably what I'm at lol. Usually I wait until I'm on a flag and wait for bombers to come straight at me on a pass, that way I don't really have to lead them. Taken a few out with field guns that way too, that's always fun.
                        Haha yeah that's usually how I end up on the receiving end of this scenario. I'll be in the attack plane flying way too low and slow for a bomb run, and next thing I know I'm dead via blast from field gun/tank/arty truck.
            A single LMG can do even 50 damage on a bomber if it's slow and close enough for a long burst.
                I fly pretty low, slow and risky sometimes when I'm attempting precision bomb drops, receive ground fire regularly and I've never gotten that much damage in a pass. But, that's just my experience. Maybe I'm just playing against a bunch of dumbasses, idk. 
            I think this is somewhat related to the discussion. [I managed to one shot an attack plane with the armored train's cannon-like turret.](http://xboxdvr.com/gamer/Vance079/video/25472320) I don't know if this is something common to happen, for I started playing a week ago, but it felt just nice!
                I did it once with the field gun. I'll probably never be able to do it again.
                Nice shot! I have many hours in the attack plane and have only been brought down maybe 6-7 times by ground weapons of any sort, and I've never done it personally. Not super common, but it does happen. I'm sure that was super satisfying.
            MG15 here, I just shoot at you fuckers all day long. Then I run Assault just yesterday, have a plane flying over head so I shoot it with my shotgun and I get the "Vehicle Disabled."

Kind of pissed, kind of interested. 
                Old thread resurrection! MG15 is the best if you're going to do it.


Yesterday I finished off a plane with the Martini-Henry and it felt real nice. 
    I only do it when the AAs have been disabled or otherwise unavailable. I'll set up prone with a telescopic bar, far enough away from the actual multiple squad assault going on that the plane will focus on me and waste the bombs/flares on me instead of smashing my team.

So far I have disabled one plane, shot out one pilot and died a fuck load of times. Doesn't help my stats but sure helps my team.
        Yeah that's not a bad way if going about it, sometimes I do waste my time trying to get one guy shooting at me and it certainly does me away from the action. Honestly any annoyance you can create on a pilot ultimately helps your team. 


But to my original point, if you're standing among 5-6 of your teammates and shoot at my plane for a second, best believe I'm going for that sweet 5-6x  multi-kill bomb drop now that I know where you guys are haha.
        I do admire people who do this and I have seen a couple of support guys together drive off a good bomber. 
    Unless it is from a support gun, in which case, the lewis and m1909 can take planes down in a clip
        From full health? From my experience they arent quite that damaging, but I'd love to be proven wrong. Also distance would become an issue pretty fast, conditions would have to be just right and a very good shooter.


If I ever get taken down solely by infantry primary weapons I'll be sure to post the clip. 
    I always shoot planes with my LMG.  I never do a huge amount of damage but I know that sort of thing is annoying when I'm a pilot, so when I'm on the ground I figure I might as well.
    Well yeah plans makes sense they were wood and canvas so bullets should damage them
What about hardline?
    In hardline normal bullets can damage pretty much every vehicle so I'm assuming people still think it's a game mechanic and are learning the hard way that its not.
        Even tanks?
            There are no tanks in hardline
                Oh
    Hardline vehicles are damaged by gunfire
        Oh, thanks
It happened to me once. I didn't process what he was doing until 5 seconds after I disintigrated him with my main cannon. 
I've tried it a few times ha, it doesn't work 
Get out. 
What about those using a xim4?  It allows keyboard/mouse control on consoles. 
    if you're going to use a pc/m to play a shooter on console you might as well play on pc, im sure the amount of people that use this thing is very, very, very, very small.
        But then you wouldn't have an incredible advantage over your peers. 
            being able to move your character and adjust your aim simultaneously gives you an advantage over 75% of this game's population so anything else is kind of irrelevant 
        I play on both actually. Sometimes the cost of upgrading can be a setback so in my times of need I use my xb1.  
    I pretty sure the mouse just simulates controller joystick movement, at least on ps4
        That's the way I understand it. 
    You're still restricted to the capped sensitivity of the game. 
    I personally consider it cheating 
        So would a steering wheel on console be cheating vs controller?  It's only adding on peripherals not adding aim bots or changing the code. 
            A steering wheel or rockband controller are peripherals supported natively on console and the developers of those games design the game with that in mind. Keyboard and mouse give players a clear edge in aim and even worse, the console aim assist makes it incredibly easy. A player using a mouse on console is a workaround, not a peripheral. They trick the console into thinking it's a controller, and it gives a clear advantage to the user. Luckily they are still pricy and not a widespread issue, but if they were more widely used then I would hope something would be done about them. Now if Microsoft or a game developer released their own kb+m and designed there game to balance it with controllers, that would be a different story. 
        Thats because it is cheating

    Fury with Brad Pitt.
see the edit I made to the original comment. 
But the arrows go up and down which is nodding yes not shaking no

Literally unplayable
I had the funniest thing happen yesterday with a heavy on ballroom blitz. I was a medic on foot, capped A and was heading to D on the left side when one showed up (driver was the only one in the tank) and he spotted me but wasn't fast or accurate enough enough to get me with his first shot so I rushed him. I stayed on either side or behind him and because the main gun only has a 35¬∞ field of view he could never get his main gun on me to take a shot. I danced with him for at least 3 minutes while my three friends in my party capped E and defended it. When I saw they died advised them to spawn on me with dynamite. It was so amazingly ridiculous. 
Can confirm.


am heavy tanker and I kill everything
What about K ammo?
    They do 5 damage and you get 4 shots. 
Okay this makes a bit more sense when you put it this way.
Are tanks that OP?
    It's a tank vs a guy with a rifle.. Yes..
        I mean relative to other games with tanks. There's tanks in older battlefields but I've never heard of this, at least not widespread.
            All the post means is that when you are 1v1 with a tank, try going prone and shakin your head for mercy since it works sometimes and you have nothing to lose really since they will generally kill you. A tank vs infantry 1 on 1 is generally favored to the tank, but tanks are probably the weakest they've ever been in this game since a single assault can easily take one down if he has some decent cover or people distracting the tank. . 
                Can confirm, mines destroy anything
I'm pretty sure they don't enter enclosed circles.
    just make sure you aren't screeching like a chimpanzee
        But this method works *EXTREMELY* well in bar fights.
    I believe those are actually seatanks you're thinking of 
        Correct and you *have* to make a circle, **NOT** an oval.
Heavy tanks and landships are assholes. Light tanks actually have a personality 
    As a heavy tanker, this is 100% accurate. 
        Also Heavy Tanker. I went 40-0 yesterday capturing and defending flags and I dont understand the "A good team will take down a tank in seconds" or the "Here I had the choice for a monster and I chose the piddly little cardboard cut out of a cartoon tank".  

What is the advantage of a light tank? They pose no threat to me when I am tanking, and with the rocket gun are easily destroyed when I am assault. Which leads me on to my next (first?) point which is it's never a good opposition that kills a tank it's bad decision making by the driver.

                This is one of the most fun experiences for me in tank combat.
                What if they see you coming from range? The only problem I have is when I don't watch the flow of a game and end up surrounded
                    You hook them. They think they will have it easy so they usually follow you. You must find something to drive around and to cover you so he has to move to shoot you. Meanwhile you drop mines on your way and make sure he has to keep following you. Then, BOOM.
                        The mines are the real equalizers. 
                        Mines are brutal if you don't steer clear of the main choke points. Learnt that the hard way.
            the howitzer.
                I know that it got nerfed for being too accurate, but does it have an advantage over the main cannon on a heavy? Does it have better reload etc?
                    

Reload slower bullet drop heavy but it does 40dmg to heavy tank
                        That and the mines and ability to fire at range that is less accurate for the heavy if you are good with it.
                        Is that 2 shots to disable? That's good

I only do it when the AAs have been disabled or otherwise unavailable. I'll set up prone with a telescopic bar, far enough away from the actual multiple squad assault going on that the plane will focus on me and waste the bombs/flares on me instead of smashing my team.

So far I have disabled one plane, shot out one pilot and died a fuck load of times. Doesn't help my stats but sure helps my team.
    Yeah that's not a bad way if going about it, sometimes I do waste my time trying to get one guy shooting at me and it certainly does me away from the action. Honestly any annoyance you can create on a pilot ultimately helps your team. 


But to my original point, if you're standing among 5-6 of your teammates and shoot at my plane for a second, best believe I'm going for that sweet 5-6x  multi-kill bomb drop now that I know where you guys are haha.
    I do admire people who do this and I have seen a couple of support guys together drive off a good bomber. 
Unless it is from a support gun, in which case, the lewis and m1909 can take planes down in a clip
    From full health? From my experience they arent quite that damaging, but I'd love to be proven wrong. Also distance would become an issue pretty fast, conditions would have to be just right and a very good shooter.


If I ever get taken down solely by infantry primary weapons I'll be sure to post the clip. 
I always shoot planes with my LMG.  I never do a huge amount of damage but I know that sort of thing is annoying when I'm a pilot, so when I'm on the ground I figure I might as well.
Well yeah plans makes sense they were wood and canvas so bullets should damage them
In hardline normal bullets can damage pretty much every vehicle so I'm assuming people still think it's a game mechanic and are learning the hard way that its not.
    Even tanks?
        There are no tanks in hardline
            Oh
Hardline vehicles are damaged by gunfire
    Oh, thanks
if you're going to use a pc/m to play a shooter on console you might as well play on pc, im sure the amount of people that use this thing is very, very, very, very small.
    But then you wouldn't have an incredible advantage over your peers. 
        being able to move your character and adjust your aim simultaneously gives you an advantage over 75% of this game's population so anything else is kind of irrelevant 
    I play on both actually. Sometimes the cost of upgrading can be a setback so in my times of need I use my xb1.  
I pretty sure the mouse just simulates controller joystick movement, at least on ps4
    That's the way I understand it. 
You're still restricted to the capped sensitivity of the game. 
I personally consider it cheating 
    So would a steering wheel on console be cheating vs controller?  It's only adding on peripherals not adding aim bots or changing the code. 
        A steering wheel or rockband controller are peripherals supported natively on console and the developers of those games design the game with that in mind. Keyboard and mouse give players a clear edge in aim and even worse, the console aim assist makes it incredibly easy. A player using a mouse on console is a workaround, not a peripheral. They trick the console into thinking it's a controller, and it gives a clear advantage to the user. Luckily they are still pricy and not a widespread issue, but if they were more widely used then I would hope something would be done about them. Now if Microsoft or a game developer released their own kb+m and designed there game to balance it with controllers, that would be a different story. 
    Thats because it is cheating
Fury with Brad Pitt.
They do 5 damage and you get 4 shots. 
It's a tank vs a guy with a rifle.. Yes..
    I mean relative to other games with tanks. There's tanks in older battlefields but I've never heard of this, at least not widespread.
        All the post means is that when you are 1v1 with a tank, try going prone and shakin your head for mercy since it works sometimes and you have nothing to lose really since they will generally kill you. A tank vs infantry 1 on 1 is generally favored to the tank, but tanks are probably the weakest they've ever been in this game since a single assault can easily take one down if he has some decent cover or people distracting the tank. . 
            Can confirm, mines destroy anything
just make sure you aren't screeching like a chimpanzee
    But this method works *EXTREMELY* well in bar fights.
I believe those are actually seatanks you're thinking of 
    Correct and you *have* to make a circle, **NOT** an oval.
As a heavy tanker, this is 100% accurate. 
    Also Heavy Tanker. I went 40-0 yesterday capturing and defending flags and I dont understand the "A good team will take down a tank in seconds" or the "Here I had the choice for a monster and I chose the piddly little cardboard cut out of a cartoon tank".  

What is the advantage of a light tank? They pose no threat to me when I am tanking, and with the rocket gun are easily destroyed when I am assault. Which leads me on to my next (first?) point which is it's never a good opposition that kills a tank it's bad decision making by the driver.

            This is one of the most fun experiences for me in tank combat.
            What if they see you coming from range? The only problem I have is when I don't watch the flow of a game and end up surrounded
                You hook them. They think they will have it easy so they usually follow you. You must find something to drive around and to cover you so he has to move to shoot you. Meanwhile you drop mines on your way and make sure he has to keep following you. Then, BOOM.
                    The mines are the real equalizers. 
                    Mines are brutal if you don't steer clear of the main choke points. Learnt that the hard way.
        the howitzer.
            I know that it got nerfed for being too accurate, but does it have an advantage over the main cannon on a heavy? Does it have better reload etc?
                

Reload slower bullet drop heavy but it does 40dmg to heavy tank
                    That and the mines and ability to fire at range that is less accurate for the heavy if you are good with it.
                    Is that 2 shots to disable? That's good
No one asked if anyone asked.

BURN THEM!
    She turned me into a newt!
        ....I got better
        I got better...
Landships are also adorable in the youre way too slow to catch me way
I think it's an O with an s inside. 
damn, i was hoping it was some kind of art style using typesetting i never heard of. boring.
    oh if you want art made of letters there's thousands of it. it's called [typography](https://www.google.com/search?q=typography+art&safe=off&tbm=isch). Enjoy!
That's seriously badass, I love the Hellriegel and it's my main weapon. But, that plane must've been severely weakened; I have nearly 40 service stars with the attack plane and have never been brought down by any weapon carried by infantry, aside for one time a guy caught a headshot on me with a really nice shot from the SMLE infantry.


The worst my plane takes is usually on a low pass ~3 players simultaneously shoot me with LMGs and I might get 30 damage. And I fly pretty low and risky for the most part. But tbf if a squad concentrated on a low passing plane, you could definitely take down a plane with full health. 
    It definitely was. I've never done more than 10 damage to a plane by myself. I have found that the Tankgewehr will do ~30 damage to a plane, although I haven't taken one down with it.

And 40 service stars, awesome. I have a lot of fun with attack planes but I'm still figuring out how to aim bombs well.
        Man I fucking love the attack plane, it's my bread 'n butter. If you're flying low and slow you can pretty much just aim directly between the lines of the bomb cam sights, but more speed and altitude requires you to "lead" the target a bit and takes some getting used to. Some guys say they don't even use the bomb cam, but I do every time. 


Honestly finding the little bastards (infantry) is half the battle. But I get a lot of multi kills just blindly bombing contested objs, or just knowing maps and where infantry clusters. 
            I adore the attack plane too. The standard version is so versatile. You can blast other planes to bits if you sneak up on them. The flares will turn the tide of battle at a flag for the chaps on the ground, and the bombs can finish a tank. Strafing too is awesome fun, especially when someone spots a sniper on a perch somewhere.
                Default loadout of the attack plane FTW. I've messed around with the other planes/loadouts and I always come back to the attack plane ground support. Those multi kill bomb drops are fucking satisfying too.


Snipers are a prime target for me when I'm flying, usually they're trying to take a pot shot at you so the scope glare gives them away even if they aren't spotted. Then they eat a round from my main MG as I'm making my next pass :D
            I have gotten a pretty good feel for bombing in third person, but in the rare event my comrades on the ground have actually spotted some enemies, giving me a good target, I'll line it up with the bombsight to make sure it hits.
                Sometimes if I'm coming in on a low and risky pass while lighting up my main MG, I might not bother to swap to bomb cam so that I don't hit the fucking ground. Other than that it's a bitch for me to land bombs in third person, but it'd be a handy skill for the reason stated above. While I was learning to bomb the ground I lost several planes by staying in the bomb cam too long.  
                    I've found it helps to divebomb - you get a better view of the ground and can kind of see where the bombs are falling.  It also seems to drop the bombs in a smaller area, so you're more likely to get kills instead of hitmarkers (assuming you drop your bombs on target).  

With the bombsight it seems better to fly level, but that hasn't worked as well for me in the third person view as divebombing.
    I wish I had gotten it on video but I took down a bomber with a mondragon storm once. Totally an accident but I shoot at every plane now just in case. 
        That's awesome! I'd have loved to see that clip, bummer. I even saved a clip from the one time a scout caught me with a headshot in a plane because it was so sweet lol.  


The biggest threat to planes as a ground troop is directly killing the pilot with a headshot, and that's likely what you did unless the plane was down to very little health. I think I do ~3 dmg when I shoot at planes with the SMLE infantry/carbine. I play scout now and then and sometimes I try for that sweet headshot to a pilot. But I just miss and hit the fucking plane :/
            If it ever happens again I'll make sure to send it to you!! It was definitely the plane though whole thing exploded and I thought it was a crazy coincidence until I got the vehicle destroyed points.

Keep trying with that SMLE it'll happen eventually I'm sure
                No shit! That's crazy. Must have nailed the engine while it had low health or something, I think that's the only way it could happen? Either way that's cool as hell. 


And yeah I'm always taking pot shots at planes with my rifle bit at best I'll get a few damage points. Someday!
    I've nailed a couple planes with my AT rifle. Although I've missed WAY more than I've ever hit
        I hear that, I'm like 2/50 for hitting planes with my AT rocket gun lol. Never took one down, just did modest damage. Maybe they weren't solid hits, idk. 
            Yeah that's probably what I'm at lol. Usually I wait until I'm on a flag and wait for bombers to come straight at me on a pass, that way I don't really have to lead them. Taken a few out with field guns that way too, that's always fun.
                Haha yeah that's usually how I end up on the receiving end of this scenario. I'll be in the attack plane flying way too low and slow for a bomb run, and next thing I know I'm dead via blast from field gun/tank/arty truck.
    A single LMG can do even 50 damage on a bomber if it's slow and close enough for a long burst.
        I fly pretty low, slow and risky sometimes when I'm attempting precision bomb drops, receive ground fire regularly and I've never gotten that much damage in a pass. But, that's just my experience. Maybe I'm just playing against a bunch of dumbasses, idk. 
    I think this is somewhat related to the discussion. [I managed to one shot an attack plane with the armored train's cannon-like turret.](http://xboxdvr.com/gamer/Vance079/video/25472320) I don't know if this is something common to happen, for I started playing a week ago, but it felt just nice!
        I did it once with the field gun. I'll probably never be able to do it again.
        Nice shot! I have many hours in the attack plane and have only been brought down maybe 6-7 times by ground weapons of any sort, and I've never done it personally. Not super common, but it does happen. I'm sure that was super satisfying.
    MG15 here, I just shoot at you fuckers all day long. Then I run Assault just yesterday, have a plane flying over head so I shoot it with my shotgun and I get the "Vehicle Disabled."

Kind of pissed, kind of interested.

            I've found it helps to divebomb - you get a better view of the ground and can kind of see where the bombs are falling.  It also seems to drop the bombs in a smaller area, so you're more likely to get kills instead of hitmarkers (assuming you drop your bombs on target).  

With the bombsight it seems better to fly level, but that hasn't worked as well for me in the third person view as divebombing.
That's awesome! I'd have loved to see that clip, bummer. I even saved a clip from the one time a scout caught me with a headshot in a plane because it was so sweet lol.  


The biggest threat to planes as a ground troop is directly killing the pilot with a headshot, and that's likely what you did unless the plane was down to very little health. I think I do ~3 dmg when I shoot at planes with the SMLE infantry/carbine. I play scout now and then and sometimes I try for that sweet headshot to a pilot. But I just miss and hit the fucking plane :/
    If it ever happens again I'll make sure to send it to you!! It was definitely the plane though whole thing exploded and I thought it was a crazy coincidence until I got the vehicle destroyed points.

Keep trying with that SMLE it'll happen eventually I'm sure
        No shit! That's crazy. Must have nailed the engine while it had low health or something, I think that's the only way it could happen? Either way that's cool as hell. 


And yeah I'm always taking pot shots at planes with my rifle bit at best I'll get a few damage points. Someday!
I hear that, I'm like 2/50 for hitting planes with my AT rocket gun lol. Never took one down, just did modest damage. Maybe they weren't solid hits, idk. 
    Yeah that's probably what I'm at lol. Usually I wait until I'm on a flag and wait for bombers to come straight at me on a pass, that way I don't really have to lead them. Taken a few out with field guns that way too, that's always fun.
        Haha yeah that's usually how I end up on the receiving end of this scenario. I'll be in the attack plane flying way too low and slow for a bomb run, and next thing I know I'm dead via blast from field gun/tank/arty truck.
I fly pretty low, slow and risky sometimes when I'm attempting precision bomb drops, receive ground fire regularly and I've never gotten that much damage in a pass. But, that's just my experience. Maybe I'm just playing against a bunch of dumbasses, idk. 
I did it once with the field gun. I'll probably never be able to do it again.
Nice shot! I have many hours in the attack plane and have only been brought down maybe 6-7 times by ground weapons of any sort, and I've never done it personally. Not super common, but it does happen. I'm sure that was super satisfying.
Old thread resurrection! MG15 is the best if you're going to do it.


Yesterday I finished off a plane with the Martini-Henry and it felt real nice. 
Oh
Can confirm, mines destroy anything
This is one of the most fun experiences for me in tank combat.
What if they see you coming from range? The only problem I have is when I don't watch the flow of a game and end up surrounded
    You hook them. They think they will have it easy so they usually follow you. You must find something to drive around and to cover you so he has to move to shoot you. Meanwhile you drop mines on your way and make sure he has to keep following you. Then, BOOM.
        The mines are the real equalizers. 
        Mines are brutal if you don't steer clear of the main choke points. Learnt that the hard way.
I know that it got nerfed for being too accurate, but does it have an advantage over the main cannon on a heavy? Does it have better reload etc?
    

Reload slower bullet drop heavy but it does 40dmg to heavy tank
        That and the mines and ability to fire at range that is less accurate for the heavy if you are good with it.
        Is that 2 shots to disable? That's good
I didn't know  reddit was for shitty Facebook posts. Nice try though  
    Thanks, only the best for you bud.
I adore the attack plane too. The standard version is so versatile. You can blast other planes to bits if you sneak up on them. The flares will turn the tide of battle at a flag for the chaps on the ground, and the bombs can finish a tank. Strafing too is awesome fun, especially when someone spots a sniper on a perch somewhere.
    Default loadout of the attack plane FTW. I've messed around with the other planes/loadouts and I always come back to the attack plane ground support. Those multi kill bomb drops are fucking satisfying too.


Snipers are a prime target for me when I'm flying, usually they're trying to take a pot shot at you so the scope glare gives them away even if they aren't spotted. Then they eat a round from my main MG as I'm making my next pass :D
I have gotten a pretty good feel for bombing in third person, but in the rare event my comrades on the ground have actually spotted some enemies, giving me a good target, I'll line it up with the bombsight to make sure it hits.
    Sometimes if I'm coming in on a low and risky pass while lighting up my main MG, I might not bother to swap to bomb cam so that I don't hit the fucking ground.
