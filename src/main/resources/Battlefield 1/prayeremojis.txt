WE ARE BF1 

HEY!
            Now look at this objective that I just found

When I say GO,  be ready to follow

GO

PLAY THE OBJECTIVE, DON'T SNIPE! 
                Ugh, LET'S TRY SOMETHING ELSE
                    Now watch and learn! We can't go wrong!

They'll trip and die on this tripwire bomb!

                        *three teammates run into tripwire bomb. BTW its Hardcore so they all die*

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!???
                            *Yes, mom! I would jump off that bridge if my friends did!*
                This is going down in history!  

Get it? Because it's ww1?


                What if I snipe in the objective? After flare gunning for our advance? Is this acceptable?
                    Step 1: Dont give a fuck about what is acceptable. Have fun playing what you want. Sure PTFO is good and helping your m8s is even better, but in the end, no one will give a shit how you play.
                        Good, I'll join hardcore servers and run over everybody on my team with my tank.  After all I need to keep my tracks greased up.  Thanks for helping me out.
                            That's the spirit!
            This meme never dies
                I love this meme
                    Honestly the best meme of all time
                    Shit for once, I don't think I know this meme. What's this referencing?
                        Search yoitube "We are number one". 

The singer had cancer and people created this meme to help him with money. Every video has the donation web in the description. Anyways its  similar to what happened with bee movie or All Stars (shrek song).
                            Oh lol after rereading the thread it makes sense now. For some reason I couldn't tell it was we are number one. 
            ALL HAIL THE BRANCH

DONT TOUCH THAT
    Don't worry there's only a 5 megabyte Origin installer on there anyways.
    It's fine, it's the PC version, it has a download code.

    YOU SCRATCHED MY CD
    DONT DROP THAT SHIT
    It's ok, it's installed on the HDD, the PC only needs it to tell if the game is legit.
    Meh, just insert the code in origin and DL it :p 
#YOU'RE GETTING FINGERPRINTS ON IT GODDAMMIT

I just spent ten minutes explaining to a six year old who just got a PlayStation 4 about proper disc etiquette. He listened, then did the exact opposite of it.

He's shit at Ratchet & Clank as well.
    So many of my old GameCube games are ruined, which is disappointing. This is important stuff, i didn't transition from cartridges well
    5 minutes ago I just had that conversation with my 54 year old father as he took BF1 out to play Fallout 4. It's not that they don't understand; they just don't care. 
    why would a six year old have a ps4?
        .75411)
            The SNES launched at $199 in 1990, which is almost $366 in 2015 dollars. It's even cheaper!
            Still though, *six*? I'd say six is a little young for all but a small few of the games on the ps4.
                too young? like kids who owned NES in the past?
                    Shit, I didn't have video games until I was like 14.
                        Very much the same. My parents were hardcore against videogames, always making play outside and stuff. Probably why I play so many games now Ive moved out, because I was never allowed to as a kid. Also why I suck at games.
                            I like to believe I'm decent at most games but it's probably why I play way too many games now, too.  Such a huge backlog, so little time.
                    Why are you just repeating the same thing as the guy above me? Pretty sure you know what I'm saying.
                        well, you seems not getting a kid get their own ps4, it might be better due to them need to use big monitor, easier for parents to control instead of let them use smartphone, which is more personal
        Cause they're cheap (250) and have kid friendly games on them. Don't need online for a kid so that's another $50 saved. 
        Uhhh well I had a PS1 when I was six so it makes sense that a six year old today would have a PS4. Why is that weird?
        Not sure but I'm letting my 8 yr old nephew play OVERWATCH and he's dominating! Such a proud aunt
        PS4 slim was about €199 here. His dad is also pretty keen to play Battlefield 1.
Clearly this is how Dice patch games...
Mod approved, 
And remember the Christmas noob.
    Is this a real thing? The whole bf get a lot of new players around this time of the year? This is my first BF( bought on launch)
        Every AAA multiplayer title that releases before Christmas will get Christmas noobs.
        Yep it's a real thing and it's our job to enact the blood rite of brutally killing them for being Christmas noobs.
        Yes. It happens every year!

WTF IS A CD ROM?
    It appears to be an ancient physical media from the late 20th century.
        Nah bro, it's an old old wooden ship from civil war times. 
    But it has the [DVD logo on it](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/DVD_logo.svg/2000px-DVD_logo.svg.png)
        fun fact: BF2 was available on DVD or 5 CD's. so all of the numbered BF games have been available on DVD. 
        Different names same shitty technology. DVD is just a larger density/capacity than what CD is.
            Oh no its not the same at all!!!


*♪♫Ohhhhh♫♪*

I can't be assed to rhyme a song about a cd.


Anyway

> a CD is composed of one thick layer of polycarbonate with a data layer on top, followed by a metal layer that reflects the laser beam onto the sensor, followed by a metal-protecting lacquer, topped by the surface layer. The DVD structure is a lot different. It actually consists of 2 polycarbonate discs glued together, each 0.6 mm thick. The data layer and the reflective metal layer are located right in the middle of the disc.

If CDs and DVDs are the same shitty tech, then HD-DVD and Blurays are the same shitty tech as DVDs and CDs, just with more pits and bumps
                Same shit more layers added. Optical is dead anyways has been for many years.
#NO NO DON'T TOUCH THAT
He bought it on disc?!
    Why wouldn't you?
        You'll never use the disc? (This is a disc of the PC version)
            Eyyyy
            1. Box versions are cheaper
2. Box look cool
        I havent bought a physical copy of a game in years. I never resell my games so why bother having a disc that can get lost or scratched? Or need 6 to install yet you lost one? Or dont even have a disc drive? 

 
He is scratching it. 
Probably should have made the disk infinite warfare or something because he's about to break it in half. 
"Please let us pray for those who play as support to drop ammo and those who play as medic to heal the wounded" The Pope (2016)
Just got the game.  I know I'm tribute for the noob harvest. 
If you've ever seen this part of mass, then you know what happens next to that disk, lol.
So did he soak this in holy water before the blessing?
#DANK
What's significant about Rudy Giuliani holding a video game?
When supper had ended, he took the disc;

he placed it in the PS4.

He took controllers, handed them to his disciples, and said:

"Take these all of you and kick ass with them. These are the NPC's which will be given up for you. 

Do this because you can't beat me."
    Unfortunately the PS4 couldn't read the disc as it was disc 1 of 5 for the PC version
    Catholic spotted
👏👏👏👏
Heading right for objective Jesus
The Pope always scratches my disks when he comes over to play.
So I know I'm asking this in a pretty biased sub, but do you think BF1 is worth the price tag on it? I absolutely love the campaigns of Battlefield games but how is the multiplayer? Is it worth $60?
    I paid $27 for it on Black Friday (ps4).
        Same, just about. 
    You can almost certainly get it for under 60. I paid 54CDN on greenmangaming less than two weeks ago. 

I can only tell you that my experience has been enjoyable. I play a 1.5-2 hours a day and have fun almost every match. I play as medic so even if I can't catch a break in a match and getting killed constantly, I find reviving people to be pretty rewarding.

I'm not a big online FPS guy. I played a lot of COD4 and Modern Warfare 2 online back in the day but none lately. This is my first online BF game and it's good fun. The chat can be a shitshow sometimes but that's universal.
    Battlefield is worth nothing without multiplayer. I might just start considering to buy it if you offered it for $10 or less if that were the case. 

With multiplayer, it's worth FAR more then the $60. 
    it's good. it is a bit of a return to BC2. there are vehicles and stuff, but it really favors infantry combat. i enjoy it. the early grind sucks, and there's times you join a server to be on the receiving end of a stomp, but that's BF. 

overall it's a great addition to the BF family. it's a solid game and is becoming one of my favorites in the series. i still liked the feel of BC2 more, but i do enjoy shooting people with bolt actions. YMMV. 

i'd try and get it on sale. but if you've got 60 to drop on a game BF1 is a good choice. 
    >  I absolutely love the campaigns of Battlefield games but how is the multiplayer? Is it worth $60?

well good news.. there is no campain so it's all multiplayer.. 

has BF ever had a campaign other then some short mission that teaches you how the mechanics work so you just don't just into the game and shit the bed? 
        Is there really no campaign?

Also, I have no idea what you're talking about. Battlefield has some of the most intense campaigns of any shooter game.

I know we're supposed to go easy on the Christmas kids....BUT, today I had 2 separate medics fail to revive me.

Medic 1 ran over to me and just started slowly shooting me with his pistol, and Medic 2 ran over to me, and just started running back and forth right on top of my body.

It was so frustrating.
    I do what medic 1 did to people playing as a scout and camping in a useless spot. 
The lords table is prepared.
He is about to eat that whole disk. Props if he he does it.
Down visiting family and am very excited to get home and run my huot through the annual harvest. 
Lord God, giver of BF1 Disc, we bless You for your Heavenly kindness. Now time to go and rape some noobs.
I expected this to be a gif where he snaps the disc in half.
When I'm not PTFO with altar boys, I'm PTFO on rush.


Can you do the same thing but with the new Run The Jewels disc?
    Digital downloads bro. 
    RTJ 🙏
If only I could afford it, I'd totally hold it like that! 
Wait...WHY DOES HE HAVE A PHYSICAL COPY? 
I didn't get it :(

God bless.
This is fun brilliant....you know the pipe is a dope sniper 
    Nah the pope is 100% a medic. 
This game is amazing. Brought back my passion for gaming 
The pope would approve of the game if he played it tbh.
I am so glad that so many of us thought the same thing. That fucker doesn't need to touch a disc like that.
The reality is that a Polish Catholic priest would bless it. Heck, they  can bless routers. 
That *is not* SOCOM II in his hands !
This is exactly why I go for digital copies only these days. People holding my discs like that. STAHP.
Clearly an error. That disc has a "1" instead of a "3" on it

            Same shit more layers added. Optical is dead anyways has been for many years.
Why wouldn't you?
    You'll never use the disc? (This is a disc of the PC version)
        Eyyyy
        1. Box versions are cheaper
2. Box look cool
    I havent bought a physical copy of a game in years. I never resell my games so why bother having a disc that can get lost or scratched? Or need 6 to install yet you lost one? Or dont even have a disc drive? 

 
Unfortunately the PS4 couldn't read the disc as it was disc 1 of 5 for the PC version
Catholic spotted
I paid $27 for it on Black Friday (ps4).
    Same, just about. 
You can almost certainly get it for under 60. I paid 54CDN on greenmangaming less than two weeks ago. 

I can only tell you that my experience has been enjoyable. I play a 1.5-2 hours a day and have fun almost every match. I play as medic so even if I can't catch a break in a match and getting killed constantly, I find reviving people to be pretty rewarding.

I'm not a big online FPS guy. I played a lot of COD4 and Modern Warfare 2 online back in the day but none lately. This is my first online BF game and it's good fun. The chat can be a shitshow sometimes but that's universal.
Battlefield is worth nothing without multiplayer. I might just start considering to buy it if you offered it for $10 or less if that were the case. 

With multiplayer, it's worth FAR more then the $60. 
it's good. it is a bit of a return to BC2. there are vehicles and stuff, but it really favors infantry combat. i enjoy it. the early grind sucks, and there's times you join a server to be on the receiving end of a stomp, but that's BF. 

overall it's a great addition to the BF family. it's a solid game and is becoming one of my favorites in the series. i still liked the feel of BC2 more, but i do enjoy shooting people with bolt actions. YMMV. 

i'd try and get it on sale. but if you've got 60 to drop on a game BF1 is a good choice. 
>  I absolutely love the campaigns of Battlefield games but how is the multiplayer? Is it worth $60?

well good news.. there is no campain so it's all multiplayer.. 

has BF ever had a campaign other then some short mission that teaches you how the mechanics work so you just don't just into the game and shit the bed? 
    Is there really no campaign?

Also, I have no idea what you're talking about. Battlefield has some of the most intense campaigns of any shooter game.
I do what medic 1 did to people playing as a scout and camping in a useless spot. 
Digital downloads bro. 
RTJ 🙏
Catholic Mass. The Eucharist has been replaced with a BF1 disc.
    Oh i meant battlefield ahaha
Name checks out.
Nah the pope is 100% a medic. 
Water is wet 
    There are people in here who thought it was real, so I mean...
Ba-ba-biddly-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

WE ARE BF1 

HEY!
    Now look at this objective that I just found

When I say GO,  be ready to follow

GO

PLAY THE OBJECTIVE, DON'T SNIPE! 
        Ugh, LET'S TRY SOMETHING ELSE
            Now watch and learn! We can't go wrong!

They'll trip and die on this tripwire bomb!

                *three teammates run into tripwire bomb. BTW its Hardcore so they all die*

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!???
                    *Yes, mom! I would jump off that bridge if my friends did!*
        This is going down in history!  

Get it? Because it's ww1?


        What if I snipe in the objective? After flare gunning for our advance? Is this acceptable?
            Step 1: Dont give a fuck about what is acceptable. Have fun playing what you want. Sure PTFO is good and helping your m8s is even better, but in the end, no one will give a shit how you play.
                Good, I'll join hardcore servers and run over everybody on my team with my tank.  After all I need to keep my tracks greased up.  Thanks for helping me out.
                    That's the spirit!
    This meme never dies
        I love this meme
            Honestly the best meme of all time
            Shit for once, I don't think I know this meme. What's this referencing?
                Search yoitube "We are number one". 

The singer had cancer and people created this meme to help him with money. Every video has the donation web in the description. Anyways its  similar to what happened with bee movie or All Stars (shrek song).
                    Oh lol after rereading the thread it makes sense now. For some reason I couldn't tell it was we are number one. 
    ALL HAIL THE BRANCH

Probably disc #1/6. Shout-out to those who have GTA V PC on disc.

    Yeah, give me back my game!

I am one with the force, and the force is with me.

*rez teammate*

I am one with the force, and the force is with me.

*throws down a med-crate while rezzing a whole squad on the objective, while mortars explode all around*

I am one with the force, and the force is with me.

*bullets wizz by while reviving two more teammates*

I am one with the force, and the force is with me.

*throws smoke down the choke point while reviving another squad, bullets and tank shells whizz by through the smoke*


    I was picturing the exact same thing haha
        [deleted]
            Right then
    Yup, when i get back from vacation I am playing a round with friends like this... 
    I am one with the force.
        And the force is with me.... UAHHHHHHHHHH

    The SNES launched at $199 in 1990, which is almost $366 in 2015 dollars. It's even cheaper!
    Still though, *six*? I'd say six is a little young for all but a small few of the games on the ps4.
        too young? like kids who owned NES in the past?
            Shit, I didn't have video games until I was like 14.
                Very much the same. My parents were hardcore against videogames, always making play outside and stuff. Probably why I play so many games now Ive moved out, because I was never allowed to as a kid. Also why I suck at games.
                    I like to believe I'm decent at most games but it's probably why I play way too many games now, too.  Such a huge backlog, so little time.
            Why are you just repeating the same thing as the guy above me? Pretty sure you know what I'm saying.
                well, you seems not getting a kid get their own ps4, it might be better due to them need to use big monitor, easier for parents to control instead of let them use smartphone, which is more personal
Cause they're cheap (250) and have kid friendly games on them. Don't need online for a kid so that's another $50 saved. 
Uhhh well I had a PS1 when I was six so it makes sense that a six year old today would have a PS4. Why is that weird?
Not sure but I'm letting my 8 yr old nephew play OVERWATCH and he's dominating! Such a proud aunt
PS4 slim was about €199 here. His dad is also pretty keen to play Battlefield 1.
Every AAA multiplayer title that releases before Christmas will get Christmas noobs.
Yep it's a real thing and it's our job to enact the blood rite of brutally killing them for being Christmas noobs.
Yes. It happens every year!
Why are people so fucked
hey can i have flair? 

preferably

turniptrump 
 
We are glad you joined us!
Nah bro, it's an old old wooden ship from civil war times. 
fun fact: BF2 was available on DVD or 5 CD's. so all of the numbered BF games have been available on DVD. 
Different names same shitty technology. DVD is just a larger density/capacity than what CD is.
    Oh no its not the same at all!!!


*♪♫Ohhhhh♫♪*

I can't be assed to rhyme a song about a cd.


Anyway

> a CD is composed of one thick layer of polycarbonate with a data layer on top, followed by a metal layer that reflects the laser beam onto the sensor, followed by a metal-protecting lacquer, topped by the surface layer. The DVD structure is a lot different. It actually consists of 2 polycarbonate discs glued together, each 0.6 mm thick. The data layer and the reflective metal layer are located right in the middle of the disc.
