        Yo I know this was posted a week ago but if you guys get a group from Reddit going, I'd love to play. Most of my friends play sporadically if ever lol
    What do you mean?? This is clearly legit, just like those "look what i found in the trash bin today" posts with a photo of a gamecube with a Windwaker collectors edition on r/gaming.
        Also those "my wife died today so im taking off some steam by playing God of War in my mancave"-posts.
        Oh, man I love windwaker
    Mom says it's my turn with the friends
    just have 6 pc
        You‚Äôre not even the op but rip
    Best part is there‚Äôs not even 5 on the other team
Especially when they run out of ammo in their primary and erratically hipfire the last person with a pistol
    It's almost as if it's me and my first post. Feeling slightly attacked now.
        Holy shit that was cancerous to watch
            Yup, yeah it was...
                I personally think I got better between then and now
                    Lmao good for you then, I remember my first season I had a 0.1 KD, now I maintain a 1.1 average.
                        Remember when Ela's sub was actually good?
                            Lmao yup, ngl it was a bit too good though.
                            It still is. As long as you can control recoil it‚Äôs probably one of the best defense guns, at least top 10

            For a console clip it wasn't /that/ bad
                Uhhhh I'm gonna be honest on console I'd be pissed if that guy killed my team like that.
                    I'd be more upset with me and my team for having the worst situational awareness of all time

        Woah woah woah, this is only a 4k you son of a gun
    Right at the bott‚Ä¶.

No wait that‚Äôs the pc keys
    Its not the consoles fault it's just his aim
    Not an excuse for bad aim
    [removed]
        Pc has changed me
    I literally typed that when I posted my first ace, I think that might have been part of the title
        Haha that's funny, I meant nothing personal!
            Don't worry, I was a literal copper back then.
the insane one taps like wtf
    Pretty sure he‚Äôs cheating
        yeah keyboard and mouse on consol
            Beat me to it
                lmao i hate those players so much
        He just drinks more water.
Yet they still always get to hot...
    People are dumb.
        This sub is dumb tbh
            100 percent agreed.
            It feels that way with every game I play, that I feel bad for being whatever rank I am, worse than my friends etc., and then I go on reddit and get reminded that most of the population of these games are casual shitters and then I feel better about myself.
                The problem isn't being casual the problem is when you go on something like like r/dota2 and everyone there is better than every pro player. Ever.
                    I didn't say there's anything wrong with being a casual, it just makes me feel better about being bad.
                    It's not just limited to the sub. 90% of Dota players seem to think they're pros stuck in MMR hell.
            Agreed but I‚Äôm addicted to Siege so I‚Äôm not leaving anytime soon
                That's the same case for me. I can't stand this sub 90% of the time but every once in a blue moon there will be a few good posts.
"Pulled a John Wick" type beat
    John wick from fortnite invaded my soul and possessed me for this 5k
Thanks so much man, this was an actually funny post. Too bad the main sub is just filled with people getting super lucky aces or clutches, and of course, the occasional soft core porn.

Edit: forgot to mention, it‚Äôs also filled to the brim with people doing things they act like are once in a lifetime, such as Castle barricade someone outside and defuse, or reinforce a wall and defuse, or fake defuse. Too many to count.
    >level 1

I saw someone post "OMG THIS GUY WOULD BE SO MAD" and it's just him doing some basic prefire from an open barricade and it catches some casual player... Pretty grim wont lie
    I saw a post of a guy on plane hitting a one tap in a custom game
        That was a pretty sick one tap tho
    Isn't this the main sub?
    this is the main sub
        This is the sub main

Stop trashtalking the girl doing cosplay and also linking there patron with imply nude Kappa
This is so unbelievably true. ‚ÄúCheck out this sick ace‚Äù it‚Äôs kind of starting to degrade this subreddit.

This was posted in livestreamfail and got 900 upvotes but ironically only got 31 upvotes in r/overwatch lol
            Yeah pretty much all of those are just people who are dumb af and just walk into the bomb
        As somebody who kinds religiously plays Overwatch and heavily use r/overwatch I love this comment and everything it stands for
        I mean, this game isn't too different from overwatch now.
        Tbf that sub's issues also have a lot to do with how it's moderated. It's set up in such a way that even fan art can't easily be shared and that's some real bullshit.
            I hate when fanart makes up the majority of a subreddit
                It's just bad when any one thing makes up the majority of a subreddit. This sub still has a decent amount of variety for its size but I can definitely see that going away as it quickly makes its way to the 1mil subscribers count.
Bro what a clip I wish I could play like that
tHaT fLiCk ThO!!
"Sorry for the bad aim, only level 10 on console lol."  You forgot to have the enemy team reinforcing with 1 minute left in the round and a level 5 Rook who never shoots during the entire round.
There's no way that you didn't steal that from pro league footage. The aim is far too accurate.

Lol they‚Äôre always like level 50 too. And they‚Äôre playing against like copper 5s with .1 kds
    Lol my first ace was exactly that.
all this is missing is a "german man lose acog xD" for the ultimate shitpost
    Haha funny jewish fbi women lost big zoom scope
This is fucking gold
    No this is copper

Is this copper thunt? xddd im plat 0.5 and would NEVER let myself get flanked like that

why are there ppl like this in the game who dont play good all the time???
    wtf are you bad try play like this and this is staged lol bad

 
EDIT: lmao you guys cant understand ANYTHING without /(letter)?
        [removed]
            I..I think they were both joking dude?
        Made me laugh
Fake, the bomb was a paid actor
    The turret is the directors son
This post makes me so happy. Every clip I see on here I‚Äôm just blown away by how bad they are, then the comments are just totally dick riding them
    Im just saying, as long as its their first ace, im happy for them, idk why everyone hates aces I just think good for them and move on
was this in a plat game!?!?
But that‚Äôs a 4k
    It's a 5K because the quality of the gameplay kills the viewer
        This was the best joke on this entire post
            Agreed
    nah man rewatch 5k big gameplay was nuts
        congrats on ace man, where do i find enemies this bad?
            You just have to be on the team that isnt mine
            Im a plat2 player, you can clearly see that. OP is hacking, you can tell by the way his aim snaps to players.
                He seems to know where all the enemies are somehow so I agree with your notion of hacking
        You must have intimidated the 5th pretty bad to make him quit like that.
    I can't believe I had to scroll this far for someone to point out there were only four üòÇ
    That‚Äôs the best part
The more you watch this the funnier it gets
    r/bettereveryloop
How do you have 5 friends
Accurate reenactment of my teammates every game
The sledge got me
Nice shot, try your map knowledge and you'll be champion no time
Reddit* sorry I just had to it was bothering me
    fug post ruined
This is funny as fuck because it is so accurate...they‚Äôre legit shooting braindead vegetables who play using an eyetracker to control their characters
Nice
Deadass
Bro your so good
Champion Rank , . . . . I will never get that good
Holy crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How‚Äôd you find the squad I always get when I solo Q??
Omg are you beaulo?????
Pretty much
I wish I had friends to play R6 with lmao
I love how it was only 4 kills too
That was fucking hectic
Holy shit bro how did you do this, the enemies couldnt have been anything less than diamond
    bro üòéüí™
If this were on console it‚Äôd be perfect
You forgot to knife the ground at the end
This was obviously staged
    R/whoosh
BRO, HOW!? YOU HAVE TO BE A PRO IN DISGUISE
And then they get more upvotes than the people who legitimately have a great ace or 4k.
I love that its not even a 5k
[removed]
    [removed]
Wow! Do you have any tips for a toilet paper 4?
    lmao toilet paper
Actually true
Like I could ever get a 5K.
so true
And in the midst of all its a 4K
That. Was. Incredible.
WOAH SUPER JOB EPIC ACE
Imagine getting aces. Haha hah 

*cries in <5 aces since game launch*
Meanwhile I get sniped through the wall by one Valk pistol bullet 10 seconds into the round trying to breach some random second story window.
And it‚Äôs not even a 5k
    lol! This is the first post i see to mention it XD
You should go pro
The truth though
Hey you're pretty good
Every time I see Ace clips or 1v4 clutches I always wonder what I have to do so I can have opponents as special as them. I always seem to have a team that tries to play with their monitors off, meanwhile the enemy team is a bunch of Beaulo clones.
The heck, how??! I‚Äôve been playing for a year, and absolutely nothing like that has happened to me welp... That guy is truly OP
Honestly, im just impressed that you have 5 friends
Sorry for his aim. He's on console.
So true
should've gone pro league
The f- squad....
That's me tho...
‚ÄúGameplay‚Äù btw LOL
Hahaha straight facts
LOOK AT THIS 5K
Yeah, and they're 5k or 4k are always "INSANE, INCREDIBLE" and smthg like that, lol
Lul
Couldn't stop laughing, great 5k dude. Wish I had all that skill
SiCk 5K BruoH
It was a 1v5 we decided to knife fight. I am awful at them. I aced
Yeah basically
Hahaha I thought you killed your own team for the sake of a bit.
My favourite part is it‚Äôs only a 4 k
I miss house!!
Can we talk about that sledge at the end tho trying to hammer an indestructible wall
You forgot to spas out with your mouse at the end.
I felt like I needed to comment cause it was at 299
Yo balolouuolo or however the fuck his name is pronounced , that u?
I have so many questions on what was happening during that round..
TRUUUUUE
Not to mention that this was a 4K lmao
OP I can't believe you forgot to film this with your phone vertically while simultaneously shaking like you have parkinsons.
You forgot the part where literally every single fucking one of then is some console kid playing causal against new players
This is so clearly staged as you can see there are only 4 people when the title says 5k. Thought we wouldn't notice, huh.
Your 5k isn't impressive if the enemies are clueless

Change my mind
That gunfight doe its as if enemy wasnt seeing you ur a god bro
Just look at the clown fiesta that r/overwatch is. Quick play highlights of a 6k dva bomb gets to hot every day.
OH MY GOD YOU SHOULD GO TO PROLEAGUE
BROOOOO!!!!! OH MY GOSH SICK ACE OH MY GOSHHHHHHHHHH
You make me laugh so hard :D
Hahahaha I needed this
Well yes, but actually yes
I‚Äôm 100% that‚Äôs four üôÉ. Maybe learn to count?
    He killed himself after reading your comment so it's 5
People who think this is a real game ü§°
Is nobody going to comment on that first "headshot" on Zofia?
This is the truest fucking shit i've ever seen, I often browse the controversial posts and this is all I see.
I know this is casual, but it reminds me too much of Copper 5
Flair this with NSFW dude...Jesus.
Bro that's so good bro how did you do that bro wanna squad up bro what rank are you bro bro
obligatory ‚ÄúCONSOLE IS UNDERRATED‚Äù
Not realistic at all. It's not on console.
[removed]
lol
Wow I guess you really unleashed your ‚ÄúInner John Wick‚Äù
Calm down meaty Marley 

Props to op everyone

Edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger
Honestly thoüòÇ
LMFAOO this is actually the funniest shit ive ever seen on reddit
and most of the time its played out on secure area casual on ps4
Nah bro you playing against bots that's not even fair to even slaughter them like this...

Nice ace tho, those one taps were nasty
Total setup
I have so many questions. 

I don't know. Guess I'll take them to my grave.
[deleted]
    This is a joke btw
why it looks like its on a local server?
ngl I would probably die to that
Yea those guys were all snorting COC and drinking hard liquor
You have just ruined every mans career
Did I forget to mention for you to look at this 5k? As well as signing up for our lord and savior Jesus Christ. He gave me two tickets to a cruise piloted by a Nigerian Prince funded from an offshore bank account.
Wow seems legit
Oh lord
Thank you so much for this!
Lmaoooo this made me laugh so hard
Guys i can confirm this clip is from a real ranked game, i was the zofia on the other team using the turret.
Lmao it's sad but true I love it!
It's one of those times where the player wasn't good, just that the other team was bad.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Is this really what the games like
Thing is, there wouldn't be any 5k at a level worth checking out. It's definitely rare which is why people still click on the videos.
Queue epic gamer moment music*
This is the best and most accurate post ever. Thank you for this
HAHAHA wtf
This is how it looks like when they let the slow kid intentionally win lol
House gone but not forgotten
holy shit this was the best post in a long time
This became a friend meetup.
MSG me ur discord am lonely
All headshots. Obvious hax.
nobody got knifed i see.
What kind of psychotic human being uses 'C' to vault??????
All headshot god ace
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ my new favorite video that was really good
Finally someone says the truth!
Someone FINALLY POSTED SOMETHING ABOUT IT, THANK YOU
Can y'all be my friend?
the sledge and zofia cracked me *upppp*
Thought this was legit for a second and then watched it a second time and read the title
    When he waltz up to the turret with his pistol I knew it had to be lol
        Well I kinda thought so too but zofia was reloading so its a bit more belivable
thank god someone finally did this, seeing all these console casual copper aces get tiring
I‚Äôve never seen a more true post
Tell me about it.
"Yeah I kinda feel like I was possessed by John Wick in this game üòéüòé"
I didn't know you could put the turret on the pool table o.O
lmfao
not accurate , not a console player
I‚Äôm dead
Bruh copper is wack
4K*
Nice ace man good job /s
*Ubisofts gameplay trailers
That last guy got me
Watch 10 other people make a post exactly like this with a slightly different title.
Damn
i like how the ash was just shooting outside lol
I love how it‚Äôs not even 5
Wow
21 k upvotes?? wtf
thank god someone said. it if it‚Äôs not clean don‚Äôt post
Excuse you? Thats a 4K
good shootin brother, some of the best I've seen on this sub
u/vredditdownloader
What in the potato special needs shit did I just watch.
This clip is way too accurate to how I get most of my ace's
Best part is that it's only a 4k
The more I watch the more it hurts
That's only 4 though you tryna trick me ha fool nice try but not funny didn't laugh lmao lmfao lmfaorofl
I wish I was lucky enough to get opponents as bad the ones in those videos
The real joke was that it‚Äôs only 4 people
Lmao yes, every 5k I see has such potato play from both sides
4?
Lesson learned: You don't need too many friends .. just the right amount who are willing to go nuts with you for a good time
iS tHAt aN ACe
Note how he only kills four people. Definitely a good description of all the 5ks I see on the internet.

Edit: I can't spell and refuse to read things before I post...
It bothers me that the attackers are defending
thats really how it be
Nice ace clutch
To finish it off tachanka tks himself
That was so epic
Free week be like:
reddit*
Console clips in a nutshell
At least he landed more shots than I did <:I
okay, fair. but that's a 4 k
Pretty accurate XD.
60 FOV
I am so confused rn
Almost thought it was real until I saw that sledge lol
no mouse spasm at the end 0/10 immersion
Tachanka too... insult to injury, I like it
4k*
Typical hackers
Love playing with AI too!
Woah dude i can't believe how skilled you are ur pretty much john wick lol
That ace tho
I love how he made this purposely trying to look bad but still hit 4 headshots
Damn you guy's are real gatekeepers about this shit, let people post their videos in peace, there's a reason Reddit has up/downvotes.
It physically and mentally pains me to watch this
If your pc is that nice and the way you aim and Move is that bad it‚Äôs sad
Oh my fuck that was painful
Lmao
Ummmmm.... where's kill #5?? üòÇ
1337
True lulw
That‚Äôs a 4k
The skill in that play is inhuman this man needs to be stoped

What a epic gamer moment
Finally someone said it, every time I‚Äôve said it I just get downvoted into oblivion
And that's a fact
Looking in the comments and people out here giving out their IGN to play with others.. thats some wholesome content
This is not me.
holy fuck that was an insane play
My first ace!!! hope you guys enojoy!!!!!!!
No hit markers?
What do you mean???? Those were pro plays
This is a bruh moment
Wow that aim worse than most console players
No one seems to notice there's also only 4 people on the other team lol
Im glad this is being addressed lol
tachanka did an amazing work
Look at this 5k
Wtf.
suCh HigH SkIlL gAmEPlaY
How did you find this footage of me?
Precisely
Lmaooooo I'm dead, thx
That aim tho
So true
They play against comatosed people but at least they're a potato
The fact that it was a 4K makes it that much better
Epic mobile gamer moves!
Did you do this with your keyboard and mouse upside down?

That aim....
Is this how diamond matches are, sorry never seen them, dun know how evolved they are from gold
Lol obviously fake
I‚Äôd laugh at your potato aim but mines just as bad...however my ‚Äúflicks‚Äù seem to never miss when I start shooting from corner to corner panicking lol
Ebic vin
Sledge is the best
5k? only saw a 4 k. should have blown up you and the last guy. fake
Damn dude, congrats on your 34k, i was your first comment and have never seen a post grow so big from new good job
    Thanks bby was trying to take the piss out of the skill cap of this subreddit. Deadset look at the Rocket league and you see people with thousands of hours pulling off some insane play and get like 50 upvotes haha. It's pretty funny that there are a ton of people in the comments saying "go pro" as a meme but I'm deadset going for it this October so we'll see how that goes. 

Chuck some of those comments in the next clip :?
        No problem lol
That aim though
I‚Äôm in this vid
That sledge trying to break the wall lmao
Um it was a 1 v 4
    That‚Äôs part of the joke
This is the most meta post I‚Äôve ever seen, and every bit of it is true
YOU KILL TACHANKY KANG
You only killed 4 people though
Bruh you only killed 4 people!!
I only have enough friends to post "Look at this instant win"
Ur bad
The copper V
When you take the special kids to paintball just so you can practice
And there arent even 5 people.. Nice.
.
You missed the intense 1v1 knife duel
This is still so relevent
Wait so how did Sofia get shot twice in the head with the pmm
Wow I get my comment deleted for saying "console moment" but this chad, full on makes fun of all of the console stereotypes and has 38k upvotes. Mods mad.

    Yo I know this was posted a week ago but if you guys get a group from Reddit going, I'd love to play. Most of my friends play sporadically if ever lol
What do you mean?? This is clearly legit, just like those "look what i found in the trash bin today" posts with a photo of a gamecube with a Windwaker collectors edition on r/gaming.
    Also those "my wife died today so im taking off some steam by playing God of War in my mancave"-posts.
    Oh, man I love windwaker
Mom says it's my turn with the friends
just have 6 pc
    You‚Äôre not even the op but rip
Best part is there‚Äôs not even 5 on the other team
It's almost as if it's me and my first post. Feeling slightly attacked now.
    Holy shit that was cancerous to watch
        Yup, yeah it was...
            I personally think I got better between then and now
                Lmao good for you then, I remember my first season I had a 0.1 KD, now I maintain a 1.1 average.
                    Remember when Ela's sub was actually good?
                        Lmao yup, ngl it was a bit too good though.
                        It still is. As long as you can control recoil it‚Äôs probably one of the best defense guns, at least top 10
                            ^^^^I'm ^^^^on ^^^^console ^^^^though...

        For a console clip it wasn't /that/ bad
            Uhhhh I'm gonna be honest on console I'd be pissed if that guy killed my team like that.
                I'd be more upset with me and my team for having the worst situational awareness of all time

        thanks for the gold!
    Woah woah woah, this is only a 4k you son of a gun
Right at the bott‚Ä¶.

No wait that‚Äôs the pc keys
Its not the consoles fault it's just his aim
Not an excuse for bad aim
[removed]
    Pc has changed me
I literally typed that when I posted my first ace, I think that might have been part of the title
    Haha that's funny, I meant nothing personal!
        Don't worry, I was a literal copper back then.
Pretty sure he‚Äôs cheating
    yeah keyboard and mouse on consol
        Beat me to it
            lmao i hate those players so much
    He just drinks more water.
People are dumb.
    This sub is dumb tbh
        100 percent agreed.
        It feels that way with every game I play, that I feel bad for being whatever rank I am, worse than my friends etc., and then I go on reddit and get reminded that most of the population of these games are casual shitters and then I feel better about myself.
            The problem isn't being casual the problem is when you go on something like like r/dota2 and everyone there is better than every pro player. Ever.
                I didn't say there's anything wrong with being a casual, it just makes me feel better about being bad.
                It's not just limited to the sub. 90% of Dota players seem to think they're pros stuck in MMR hell.
        Agreed but I‚Äôm addicted to Siege so I‚Äôm not leaving anytime soon
            That's the same case for me. I can't stand this sub 90% of the time but every once in a blue moon there will be a few good posts.
John wick from fortnite invaded my soul and possessed me for this 5k
>level 1

I saw someone post "OMG THIS GUY WOULD BE SO MAD" and it's just him doing some basic prefire from an open barricade and it catches some casual player... Pretty grim wont lie
I saw a post of a guy on plane hitting a one tap in a custom game
    That was a pretty sick one tap tho
Isn't this the main sub?
this is the main sub

This was posted in livestreamfail and got 900 upvotes but ironically only got 31 upvotes in r/overwatch lol
        Yeah pretty much all of those are just people who are dumb af and just walk into the bomb
    As somebody who kinds religiously plays Overwatch and heavily use r/overwatch I love this comment and everything it stands for
    I mean, this game isn't too different from overwatch now.
    Tbf that sub's issues also have a lot to do with how it's moderated. It's set up in such a way that even fan art can't easily be shared and that's some real bullshit.
        I hate when fanart makes up the majority of a subreddit
            It's just bad when any one thing makes up the majority of a subreddit. This sub still has a decent amount of variety for its size but I can definitely see that going away as it quickly makes its way to the 1mil subscribers count.

The turret is the directors son
Im just saying, as long as its their first ace, im happy for them, idk why everyone hates aces I just think good for them and move on
It's a 5K because the quality of the gameplay kills the viewer
    This was the best joke on this entire post
        Agreed
nah man rewatch 5k big gameplay was nuts
    congrats on ace man, where do i find enemies this bad?
        You just have to be on the team that isnt mine
        Im a plat2 player, you can clearly see that. OP is hacking, you can tell by the way his aim snaps to players.
            He seems to know where all the enemies are somehow so I agree with your notion of hacking
    You must have intimidated the 5th pretty bad to make him quit like that.

###exDEEEEEEEEEEEE
thanks for the gold!
Don't worry, I was a literal copper back then.
Beat me to it
    lmao i hate those players so much
100 percent agreed.
It feels that way with every game I play, that I feel bad for being whatever rank I am, worse than my friends etc., and then I go on reddit and get reminded that most of the population of these games are casual shitters and then I feel better about myself.
    The problem isn't being casual the problem is when you go on something like like r/dota2 and everyone there is better than every pro player. Ever.
        I didn't say there's anything wrong with being a casual, it just makes me feel better about being bad.
        It's not just limited to the sub. 90% of Dota players seem to think they're pros stuck in MMR hell.
Agreed but I‚Äôm addicted to Siege so I‚Äôm not leaving anytime soon
    That's the same case for me. I can't stand this sub 90% of the time but every once in a blue moon there will be a few good posts.

Yeah pretty much all of those are just people who are dumb af and just walk into the bomb
I hate when fanart makes up the majority of a subreddit
    It's just bad when any one thing makes up the majority of a subreddit. This sub still has a decent amount of variety for its size but I can definitely see that going away as it quickly makes its way to the 1mil subscribers count.

Agreed
You just have to be on the team that isnt mine
Im a plat2 player, you can clearly see that. OP is hacking, you can tell by the way his aim snaps to players.
    He seems to know where all the enemies are somehow so I agree with your notion of hacking

I personally think I got better between then and now
    Lmao good for you then, I remember my first season I had a 0.1 KD, now I maintain a 1.1 average.
        Remember when Ela's sub was actually good?
            Lmao yup, ngl it was a bit too good though.
            It still is. As long as you can control recoil it‚Äôs probably one of the best defense guns, at least top 10
                ^^^^I'm ^^^^on ^^^^console ^^^^though...
Uhhhh I'm gonna be honest on console I'd be pissed if that guy killed my team like that.
    I'd be more upset with me and my team for having the worst situational awareness of all time
