[[Jynxzi Watches The WORST Clip of 2023]]





He‚Äôs the only person on earth that still has to blink manuallyüíÄ
    He has Tourettes Syndrome.
        Is this true? Seems more like r/fakedisordercringe to me. If I'm wrong, then I'm sorry. I just haven't seen it addressed anywhere.
            You‚Äôre super wrong the fuck? Go back to that sub and see how much people make it their identity. You can see something‚Äôs up with him but people that fake would NEVER leave it up to guess work
                Unless he's not trying to make it his identity and just likes to be loud and goofy. Nobody really knows. I know he said he had it once, but we don't know if it was a joke or not. OCD can also manifest itself in tics.
                    As far as I know his Blinking is the only tic he has. But I am not sure about the rest of his behavior.
                        I'm not either. That's what I'm saying - none of us really know, so I don't think it makes sense to say with confidence anything one way or the other. I also don't think it's that important - if he does have a disorder, he can keep it private, and that's fine. If he doesn't and it's just a character he plays, it's kinda cringe, but whatever, if people enjoy it and he's not making fun of stereotypes, then that's fine too. Might not be everyone's cup of tea, but that's okay.
                            I have no reason not to believe him. He said his blinking is a tick. Thats all.
                                It could be. The rest of his behaviour though?
                                    No idea. I just laugh at his videos from time to time.
                                    it's called a personality.
        Does he actually?

                Idk if he's joking or what
Say what you want about Jynxzi, but he's done a lot for bringing Siege back into the limelight.
    I like the guy. I haven‚Äôt played Siege in years but I almost always stop scrolling when his TikToks come by. Dude is legitimately funny, i feel like he doesn‚Äôt smash his camera enough anymore tho.
    jynxzi is the goat and you can't say otherwise
        FR, he truly is the goat. His fans in chat though, uhhhh, might need some help.
        jynxzi is the goat, but the people that meatride him are not LMAO
        Otherwise
            Same.
    It‚Äôs more so his younger fanbase that give him a bad rep with the way they try and emulate him, I think he seems like a solid guy
        Younger fans do it with all popular streamers or YouTubers though. They don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs a persona and that the person making videos is (usually) pretty normal
    The hells a limelight
        A lime thats a light
        https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/limelight

^saved you a copy paste, an enter, and a click
    His fans are all brainless 13-year-old boys who don't use they mic except to say slurs, I don't think Jynxzi has brought Siege into the limelight unless that limelight is in a kindergarten.
        Speak for yourself. I know more adults that watch him than kids. I‚Äôm 24 I watch him pretty often and the few 30yr olds I know that play r6, LOVE jynxzi
            I don't believe you.
                I really don‚Äôt care to make you believe me. Just telling you my personal experience.
                    I‚Äôm almost 30, have literally never played siege, don‚Äôt even follow this subreddit, literally only stopped on this recommended post because i saw it was Jynxi, but i saw a couple of his videos recommended on my YT page (mostly the tim reaction ones) and i found him hilarious and am honestly thinking about trying out siege now. totally anecdotal but oh well ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è couple of my friends found him funny too. 

but i can very easily see how younger kids could try to imitate him and totally miss the mark.
        Siege has always had the most toxic fan base on Xbox for years, doesn‚Äôt really need any help
    I haven‚Äôt played in years and don‚Äôt want to, but I do watch Jynxzi as well as other of my friends. He‚Äôs definitely a great person for the community
    jynxzi is the reason i even got back into the game lol
Say what you want about him. He is the face of this game and his audience is the next generation of Rainbow Six. You are in the minority and you have been passed by.
    All facts
    If the army of toxic kids who try and fail to Imitate him is the next generation of siege players then the game's going to be majorly fucked in the future if/when Jynxi quits if there's no one to replace him
        Dude blew up overnight after playing this game for 8 years. Hes just starting to become a thing. Hes not quitting anytime soon.
            He is going to quit eventually. If there isn't other upcoming creators to breathe more life we are fucked, but with the following he has I don't think it'll take long for new prospecting creators to rise up, but if that doesn't happen and the toxicity all the new players failing to imitate him permeate, the game is going to go right back to where it was before him
                You realize he got TimtheTatman and DoctorDisrespect playing the game? Tim has also brought all of his other streaming friends to the game. 

Its better now than it ever has been.
    I've never heard of this guy in my life
        Literally the number 1 twitch streamer for the past few months.
I like how everyone blames him for the run and gun meta
    He is the exact opposite of run and gun. Jynxi is Mr. Angles. All he does is hold pixels and play smart.
        For real. He'll be the first to stop a video on attack in the first few seconds and ask "why aren't we droning?"
    This is news to me lol. I've literally never heard this before
        It happens quite a bit here. I think mostly from a lot of his fans being like that
    I‚Äôve never seen someone say this but he literally always calls people out for not droning and always tells people to hold angles so that‚Äôs crazy if people really say that
    Beaulo and oozie are more to ‚Äúblame‚Äù
        Yeah as well as Spoit and Shaiko
            Yep
This is my spirit animal when I play rainbow
Hes Loud and only encourages the squeaker to rage n scream in game. Can't stand him. Loud doesn't = funny
     Nah you wrong 
Tyler 1 and Junko prove that loud does in fact = funny
Edit: After you downvote my comment please lookup KingCobraJFS
        That's just like your opinion man
            Fuck you
jynxzi my beloved
Man Tyler1 looks like he lost weight.
How tf is this man considered popular
    So we‚Äôre in copper.
        GOOD AIM!!!

                        gyatt
    His audience are all only 5-or-6, the next time you see a Jynxzi charm in-game you should place a bet with your friends that the Jynxzi fan is gonna have squeakervoice. You can always make free money on betting that Jynxzis fans will be actual children who got no business playing siege.
        I‚Äôm 26, in med school, and a massive fan. Call me whatever you want, but jizzo is funny af to watch and I do learn from watching him.
            As if the American medical system needed another L to add to the pile
                you just seem like a miserable person
                    Dog I said this two months ago.
        And you're bitching because?
            Because his fanbase aren't reliable teammates and they make for uninteresting opponents because they're all children. I think an intelligent reader would've gleaned this from what I said earlier about how they're all only six or seven. Stupid question.
                I‚Äôm 35 and a big fan of
                    Someone your age should at least be embarrassed to admit that. To me this is like admitting you're super into Yo Gabba Gabba at your age, this is indicative of a heartbreaking degree of arrested development.
                        you said your issue is that the fanbase is children

when presented with a fan who isn‚Äôt a child, you simply insult them, unprompted?

seems like you are the common issue
                            Well first of all its the Internet so there's a good chance he's just lying about his age because he feels called out. Second of all, really sad extremely embarrassing men get into children's media all the time. The bronies existed, people in their 40s watch Bluey‚Ñ¢, a small demographic of adults will always watch content for drooling children to cope with the fact that they're unhappy being adults instead of getting therapy. That's not my problem that's apparently this guy's.
                                you said your issue is the fanbase is children

but now you describe the content as specifically being *for* children

just say you don‚Äôt like the streamer if that‚Äôs all it is
                                    I can have two issues with this problem at once. I don't really draw much of a distinction between children and extremely embarrassing adults who act like children. I do think Jynxzis fanbase is mostly actual children though. Sure maybe some demographic as high as 5-6% of his audience might be failsons in their 20s and 30s but that's no concern of mine because I've been hating on the Jynxzi community since day one and youse guys are the only adult Jynxzi fans I've seen so far, the overwhelming plurality of his fans are gonna be kids.
And I don't know anything about the streamer, I don't know what he does. I'm sure Jynxzi as a person and content creator is fine, I'm not gonna watch him. My problem is with his extremely annoying fanbase of highschoolers-at-best who've flooded into siege in the past two years.
                                thats a lot of projection lil bro
                                    It's been a month since I wrote this and I've only become more convinced that I was completely correct in saying this, matter of fact I took exactly this take not two days ago and everyone agreed with me then.

So as embarrassing as it is that you decided to respond to a month-old thread nobody's thought about since back then, I actually am pleased that I'm so consistently right that I'm right months in advance of everyone else. It's good to be the smartest guy in the community and it is my privilege that you reminded me that I am.
                        Why do you care so much
                            I don't. This is like the eighty-fifth most important thing I'm doing this morning. I literally don't think of youse guys for more than a second of sincere annoyance any time you're brought up and that quickly goes away.
                        I‚Äôm also super into Yo Gabba Gabba, how did you know?!
                            Call it me recognizing a pattern of behavior
                I'm asking because you type as if you're educated and yet use over-generalizations and fallacies to bitch and moan about something that doesn't affect you unless you actively insert yourself into the conversation. No one cares if you don't like a streamer but quit saying shit like "all his fanbase" when generalizations are the most idiotic and braindead thing you can say when trying to SEEM smart. Mute up dude
            Bitching is when I don't like something
                No bitching is when you don't like something and then go on and on about it and complain about the people who do. No one would have a problem with the dude if he said "I personally don't like Jynxzi" rather than him saying "all Jynxzi fans are children if you like him you're immature"
    Have you seen this playerbase?
        Extremely autistic?
            In like a super bad unloving child kinda way, yes
                No wonder I love this game so much :/
    He is considered popular because hundreds of thousands of people pay $5/per month so that they can support him
This dude is insufferable. How can you watch this?!
    He's not for everyone, but he's actually very knowledgeable of how Siege should be played. I'm convinced most of what he does is an act to be entertaining. I mean he was #1 on Twitch at one point, so say what you want about him but he's doing great things for the Siege community
        His older streams when chat wasn‚Äôt weird were way more chill he just overreacts and yells bcs that‚Äôs what goes viral
    Smooth brains think alike. That's how
    Loud = haha
    Your time‚Äôs up old man. The please has been uttered, no takebacksies. I don‚Äôt make the rules ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    It is the siege community after all
Jynxzi‚Äôs the tyler1 of r6
He's unfunny but, he did bring a whole Lotta people to siege to be fair
Damn why do you guys give a shit what this person thinks? I‚Äôm tired of streamers
    redditors ain't ready to discover that not everyone is gonna be like them
    Children, the answer is always children.
        You have "Get off my lawn you damn kids" energy
            Don't be ridiculous kids don't play on lawns anymore.
                Replace "lawn" with "R6S game" and it'll make more sense to you
                    Well you're describing that one Simpsons scene where they ask that guy to imagine a world without Republicans and its just a field where everyone on earth is smiling and dancing and holding hands for me right now, so yeah I think that'd improve Rainbow Six a lot, thank you for asking.
                        Depending on which character they asked, you may have likened your line of thinking with a complete moron's. In fact, most guys in the Simpsons are complete morons, and you should know better than them.
                            They say the inability to understand metaphors is a sign of poor critical-thinking skills and may be indicative of some diseases of the mind. You might wanna get yourself seen by a therapist if you haven't already.
    not everybody in the world is gonna be like you and act how you want them to act once you grow a pair and face the real word you might realise that kid.
Cringe.
Worst Siege YouTuber.
    He‚Äôs the worst but brings in more views and more players than every siege streamer hands down. He‚Äôs also the one who brought siege back. But he‚Äôs the worst
        Yeah man it's subjective. He's the worst to me. I don't like him because he's obnoxious, toxic, and annoying. Those are not things I appreciate about anyone or any group of gamers, let alone someone with as big of a following as Jynxzi.
When he stops faking a speech impediment he's almost entertaining to watch. Says what my brain screams mid-match. Then he remembers to fake a speech impediment and my enjoyment of a clip drops to zero.   


So unnecessary.
    He‚Äôs trilling. But ya its funny when he uses it correctly but it drives me nuts when he throws one in where it makes absolutely no sense.
If this is the face of siege it really reflects the community.
Am I the only person who can‚Äôt stand him? Yeah I get it‚Äôs all an act/bit but at some point it goes so far and comes back around to being actually cringe
Imagine getting this worked up over a video game. Yikes
I'm glad I quit when I did if this is the face of siege. Holy shit.
Their IQ drops bc when it‚Äôs a 1v5 they get all cocky w it. They think it‚Äôs a easy dub now tsk tsk
He‚Äôs got a good point. Why the fuck, as a defender, would you go outside? I‚Äôve never understood that in any sense
True dat
He has Tourettes Syndrome.
    Is this true? Seems more like r/fakedisordercringe to me. If I'm wrong, then I'm sorry. I just haven't seen it addressed anywhere.

            No bitching is when you don't like something and then go on and on about it and complain about the people who do. No one would have a problem with the dude if he said "I personally don't like Jynxzi" rather than him saying "all Jynxzi fans are children if you like him you're immature"
Have you seen this playerbase?
    Extremely autistic?
        In like a super bad unloving child kinda way, yes
            No wonder I love this game so much :/
He is considered popular because hundreds of thousands of people pay $5/per month so that they can support him
He's not for everyone, but he's actually very knowledgeable of how Siege should be played. I'm convinced most of what he does is an act to be entertaining. I mean he was #1 on Twitch at one point, so say what you want about him but he's doing great things for the Siege community
    His older streams when chat wasn‚Äôt weird were way more chill he just overreacts and yells bcs that‚Äôs what goes viral
Smooth brains think alike. That's how
Loud = haha
Your time‚Äôs up old man. The please has been uttered, no takebacksies. I don‚Äôt make the rules ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It is the siege community after all
redditors ain't ready to discover that not everyone is gonna be like them
Children, the answer is always children.
    You have "Get off my lawn you damn kids" energy
        Don't be ridiculous kids don't play on lawns anymore.
            Replace "lawn" with "R6S game" and it'll make more sense to you
                Well you're describing that one Simpsons scene where they ask that guy to imagine a world without Republicans and its just a field where everyone on earth is smiling and dancing and holding hands for me right now, so yeah I think that'd improve Rainbow Six a lot, thank you for asking.
                    Depending on which character they asked, you may have likened your line of thinking with a complete moron's. In fact, most guys in the Simpsons are complete morons, and you should know better than them.
                        They say the inability to understand metaphors is a sign of poor critical-thinking skills and may be indicative of some diseases of the mind. You might wanna get yourself seen by a therapist if you haven't already.
not everybody in the world is gonna be like you and act how you want them to act once you grow a pair and face the real word you might realise that kid.
He‚Äôs the worst but brings in more views and more players than every siege streamer hands down. He‚Äôs also the one who brought siege back. But he‚Äôs the worst
    Yeah man it's subjective. He's the worst to me. I don't like him because he's obnoxious, toxic, and annoying. Those are not things I appreciate about anyone or any group of gamers, let alone someone with as big of a following as Jynxzi.
He‚Äôs trilling. But ya its funny when he uses it correctly but it drives me nuts when he throws one in where it makes absolutely no sense.
Is this true? Seems more like r/fakedisordercringe to me. If I'm wrong, then I'm sorry. I just haven't seen it addressed anywhere.
    You‚Äôre super wrong the fuck? Go back to that sub and see how much people make it their identity. You can see something‚Äôs up with him but people that fake would NEVER leave it up to guess work
        Unless he's not trying to make it his identity and just likes to be loud and goofy. Nobody really knows. I know he said he had it once, but we don't know if it was a joke or not. OCD can also manifest itself in tics.
            As far as I know his Blinking is the only tic he has. But I am not sure about the rest of his behavior.
                I'm not either. That's what I'm saying - none of us really know, so I don't think it makes sense to say with confidence anything one way or the other. I also don't think it's that important - if he does have a disorder, he can keep it private, and that's fine. If he doesn't and it's just a character he plays, it's kinda cringe, but whatever, if people enjoy it and he's not making fun of stereotypes, then that's fine too. Might not be everyone's cup of tea, but that's okay.
                    I have no reason not to believe him. He said his blinking is a tick. Thats all.
                        It could be. The rest of his behaviour though?
                            No idea. I just laugh at his videos from time to time.
                            it's called a personality.
Does he actually?
    https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8AfeQoF/
        Idk if he's joking or what
FR, he truly is the goat. His fans in chat though, uhhhh, might need some help.
jynxzi is the goat, but the people that meatride him are not LMAO
Otherwise
    Same.
Younger fans do it with all popular streamers or YouTubers though. They don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs a persona and that the person making videos is (usually) pretty normal

Speak for yourself. I know more adults that watch him than kids. I‚Äôm 24 I watch him pretty often and the few 30yr olds I know that play r6, LOVE jynxzi
    I don't believe you.
        I really don‚Äôt care to make you believe me. Just telling you my personal experience.
            I‚Äôm almost 30, have literally never played siege, don‚Äôt even follow this subreddit, literally only stopped on this recommended post because i saw it was Jynxi, but i saw a couple of his videos recommended on my YT page (mostly the tim reaction ones) and i found him hilarious and am honestly thinking about trying out siege now. totally anecdotal but oh well ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è couple of my friends found him funny too. 

but i can very easily see how younger kids could try to imitate him and totally miss the mark.
Siege has always had the most toxic fan base on Xbox for years, doesn‚Äôt really need any help
Dude blew up overnight after playing this game for 8 years. Hes just starting to become a thing. Hes not quitting anytime soon.
    He is going to quit eventually. If there isn't other upcoming creators to breathe more life we are fucked, but with the following he has I don't think it'll take long for new prospecting creators to rise up, but if that doesn't happen and the toxicity all the new players failing to imitate him permeate, the game is going to go right back to where it was before him
        You realize he got TimtheTatman and DoctorDisrespect playing the game? Tim has also brought all of his other streaming friends to the game. 

Its better now than it ever has been.
Literally the number 1 twitch streamer for the past few months.
For real. He'll be the first to stop a video on attack in the first few seconds and ask "why aren't we droning?"
It happens quite a bit here. I think mostly from a lot of his fans being like that
Yeah as well as Spoit and Shaiko
    Yep
That's just like your opinion man
    Fuck you

I‚Äôm 26, in med school, and a massive fan. Call me whatever you want, but jizzo is funny af to watch and I do learn from watching him.
    As if the American medical system needed another L to add to the pile
        you just seem like a miserable person
            Dog I said this two months ago.
And you're bitching because?
    Because his fanbase aren't reliable teammates and they make for uninteresting opponents because they're all children. I think an intelligent reader would've gleaned this from what I said earlier about how they're all only six or seven. Stupid question.
        I‚Äôm 35 and a big fan of
            Someone your age should at least be embarrassed to admit that. To me this is like admitting you're super into Yo Gabba Gabba at your age, this is indicative of a heartbreaking degree of arrested development.
                you said your issue is that the fanbase is children

when presented with a fan who isn‚Äôt a child, you simply insult them, unprompted?

seems like you are the common issue
                    Well first of all its the Internet so there's a good chance he's just lying about his age because he feels called out. Second of all, really sad extremely embarrassing men get into children's media all the time. The bronies existed, people in their 40s watch Bluey‚Ñ¢, a small demographic of adults will always watch content for drooling children to cope with the fact that they're unhappy being adults instead of getting therapy. That's not my problem that's apparently this guy's.
                        you said your issue is the fanbase is children

but now you describe the content as specifically being *for* children

just say you don‚Äôt like the streamer if that‚Äôs all it is
                            I can have two issues with this problem at once. I don't really draw much of a distinction between children and extremely embarrassing adults who act like children. I do think Jynxzis fanbase is mostly actual children though. Sure maybe some demographic as high as 5-6% of his audience might be failsons in their 20s and 30s but that's no concern of mine because I've been hating on the Jynxzi community since day one and youse guys are the only adult Jynxzi fans I've seen so far, the overwhelming plurality of his fans are gonna be kids.
And I don't know anything about the streamer, I don't know what he does. I'm sure Jynxzi as a person and content creator is fine, I'm not gonna watch him. My problem is with his extremely annoying fanbase of highschoolers-at-best who've flooded into siege in the past two years.
                        thats a lot of projection lil bro
                            It's been a month since I wrote this and I've only become more convinced that I was completely correct in saying this, matter of fact I took exactly this take not two days ago and everyone agreed with me then.

So as embarrassing as it is that you decided to respond to a month-old thread nobody's thought about since back then, I actually am pleased that I'm so consistently right that I'm right months in advance of everyone else. It's good to be the smartest guy in the community and it is my privilege that you reminded me that I am.
                Why do you care so much
                    I don't. This is like the eighty-fifth most important thing I'm doing this morning. I literally don't think of youse guys for more than a second of sincere annoyance any time you're brought up and that quickly goes away.
                I‚Äôm also super into Yo Gabba Gabba, how did you know?!
                    Call it me recognizing a pattern of behavior
        I'm asking because you type as if you're educated and yet use over-generalizations and fallacies to bitch and moan about something that doesn't affect you unless you actively insert yourself into the conversation. No one cares if you don't like a streamer but quit saying shit like "all his fanbase" when generalizations are the most idiotic and braindead thing you can say when trying to SEEM smart. Mute up dude

I‚Äôm almost 30, have literally never played siege, don‚Äôt even follow this subreddit, literally only stopped on this recommended post because i saw it was Jynxi, but i saw a couple of his videos recommended on my YT page (mostly the tim reaction ones) and i found him hilarious and am honestly thinking about trying out siege now. totally anecdotal but oh well ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è couple of my friends found him funny too. 

but i can very easily see how younger kids could try to imitate him and totally miss the mark.

Dog I said this two months ago.
Someone your age should at least be embarrassed to admit that. To me this is like admitting you're super into Yo Gabba Gabba at your age, this is indicative of a heartbreaking degree of arrested development.
    you said your issue is that the fanbase is children

when presented with a fan who isn‚Äôt a child, you simply insult them, unprompted?

seems like you are the common issue
        Well first of all its the Internet so there's a good chance he's just lying about his age because he feels called out. Second of all, really sad extremely embarrassing men get into children's media all the time. The bronies existed, people in their 40s watch Bluey‚Ñ¢, a small demographic of adults will always watch content for drooling children to cope with the fact that they're unhappy being adults instead of getting therapy. That's not my problem that's apparently this guy's.
            you said your issue is the fanbase is children

but now you describe the content as specifically being *for* children

just say you don‚Äôt like the streamer if that‚Äôs all it is
                I can have two issues with this problem at once. I don't really draw much of a distinction between children and extremely embarrassing adults who act like children. I do think Jynxzis fanbase is mostly actual children though. Sure maybe some demographic as high as 5-6% of his audience might be failsons in their 20s and 30s but that's no concern of mine because I've been hating on the Jynxzi community since day one and youse guys are the only adult Jynxzi fans I've seen so far, the overwhelming plurality of his fans are gonna be kids.
And I don't know anything about the streamer, I don't know what he does. I'm sure Jynxzi as a person and content creator is fine, I'm not gonna watch him. My problem is with his extremely annoying fanbase of highschoolers-at-best who've flooded into siege in the past two years.
            thats a lot of projection lil bro
                It's been a month since I wrote this and I've only become more convinced that I was completely correct in saying this, matter of fact I took exactly this take not two days ago and everyone agreed with me then.

So as embarrassing as it is that you decided to respond to a month-old thread nobody's thought about since back then, I actually am pleased that I'm so consistently right that I'm right months in advance of everyone else. It's good to be the smartest guy in the community and it is my privilege that you reminded me that I am.
    Why do you care so much
        I don't. This is like the eighty-fifth most important thing I'm doing this morning. I literally don't think of youse guys for more than a second of sincere annoyance any time you're brought up and that quickly goes away.
    I‚Äôm also super into Yo Gabba Gabba, how did you know?!
        Call it me recognizing a pattern of behavior
Well you're describing that one Simpsons scene where they ask that guy to imagine a world without Republicans and its just a field where everyone on earth is smiling and dancing and holding hands for me right now, so yeah I think that'd improve Rainbow Six a lot, thank you for asking.
    Depending on which character they asked, you may have likened your line of thinking with a complete moron's. In fact, most guys in the Simpsons are complete morons, and you should know better than them.
        They say the inability to understand metaphors is a sign of poor critical-thinking skills and may be indicative of some diseases of the mind. You might wanna get yourself seen by a therapist if you haven't already.
I'm not either. That's what I'm saying - none of us really know, so I don't think it makes sense to say with confidence anything one way or the other. I also don't think it's that important - if he does have a disorder, he can keep it private, and that's fine. If he doesn't and it's just a character he plays, it's kinda cringe, but whatever, if people enjoy it and he's not making fun of stereotypes, then that's fine too. Might not be everyone's cup of tea, but that's okay.
    I have no reason not to believe him. He said his blinking is a tick. Thats all.
        It could be. The rest of his behaviour though?
            No idea. I just laugh at his videos from time to time.
