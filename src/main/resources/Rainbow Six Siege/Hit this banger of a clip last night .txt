[[Hit this banger of a clip last night ]]





I think this might be the worst one I’ve seen this week
    I take pride in that
        I love playing piss drunk and wasting a 32 round shotty clip as Alibi and getting the kill last shell, bout the same thing
            ya only difference is that I was sober
                Don’t admit that shit guy
                    honestly I thought it was hilarious
                        she ain’t pretty, but she’s mine.
                            This comment with that username fucking floored me lmao
                        Same, gg, I gotta good laugh
The whole lobby was aluminum 7
    Tin foil hat 9
        Wood plank 4
            Cardboard 2
                Cold chicken wing 4
                    Pudding 5
                        Jr. 3
    Plastic Bag 3
I'm going to assume he's champ
    Ya ranked number one in the world 💪💪
        Lmfao your profile pic got me
How did Finka not go down after the first few shots
    Probably nano boosts
        You’re powered up. Get in there!
            I am unstoppable.
            *Hammer down!*
        Can she spam those when she’s shot??? I’m a new player this szn like Silver IV and always die to her and Doc
            Can’t spam them there’s a cooldown
                Ah ok ty
                    Her ability also gives every attacker reduced recoil and picks up downed teammates when used
This looks like the most average R6 play
Two re’s in a tard
dirt 9
Sometimes I think it’s too late to get into r6 cuz the skill level must be so high, then I watch videos like this and I’m ready to join
    You could deff start better than a lot of people. So many people are SO bad lol
"BADDDDDDD AIM" -Jynxi
    Was thinking about sending it to him
    Nah he’d go “BATHDDDD AIM”
We not making it out of copper with this one 🔥🔥🔥🔥
    Stuck in aluminum 3 for ever 😔
Gotta start somewhere
    I've been playing since new dawn and this was by far the worst I have ever played
Tom clancy didnt die for this bruh
    No he lived so this can happen
According to Jynxi “worst clip of the week”
This must have been in a Wood 3 lobby 😂
My god it’s Jason born
So we're in mashed potato 3
Rank is Spaghetti And Meatballs IV
I absolutely love this.

I would be proud to have you on my squad any day!

    Aluminum 3 for ever
*how it feels to chew bronze lobbies*
What?
    Plastic lobbies you wouldn't understand
        I remember those days back during beta
If I was spectating you, I would be halfway between yelling a slur and jumping out of my seat before I saw the victory screen. Congratulations, welcome to the team.
I love how you can immediately tell hes on console/controller
Baddddd aim
This is incredible
Did they buff the pistol? (I havnt played thorn in a while)
    I think that they were both on low health from my primary, but the pistol is decent you just can't see shit
        Love how you get defensive instantly, especially when you have no idea what the question was for, you trying to tell us something? I was asking about the recoil, it used to be unplayable but here you are lazer beaming them, now you could have some great control but idk.
            Sorry though you were referring to the damage considering that they both died pretty quickly to the pistol opposed to the actual primary. Recoil wise it wasn't that bad. Not trying to get defensive
                Nah, that gun shoots fast so it makes sense they would die quickly (atleast in reality). You had a good play tho
I’m brain dead now.
    Glad to spread it
🥔🥔🥔
Dayum bro you gotta coach me on how to aim
John wick 5: lobotomy
I saw you stop to clip the finka part😏
This clip smells like Pennies
I swear console is an entirely different game
“I’m diamond 1”
Damn bro, this was definitely THE clip I’ve ever seen!
    It is indeed one of the clips of the time
How many bullets does it take to get to the center of a Finka pop?
    Let's find out.... One mag, two mags
Yall both suck at shooting.
    Aluminum 3 baby 💪💪💪
What in the retarnation

What rank u r tho?
    I have not touched ranked since y6
        Same my g I played it 5 years ago what platform you on 
What level are you?
            I think I'm 200 plus on xbox
                Yh I'm 250 myself but 1 tip 1 season focus on just stay in obj win every good fight tye smartest u will rank up when u get plat meet good teammates not childish niggers that understand when yall lose or win all team effort
Holy controller aim
    New input device just dropped
        Professionals use a goddamn HOTAS and trackir, get your shit together
            Nvm r/anarchychess was breaching containment again
every day i see a console clip im further convinced that i am of the top percent of gunskill in this game when it comes to controller



edit: and it makes me even sadder that whenever i try to post a clip i just get "post submitted" and it never goes up on the sub, so i cant even back up what i claim
nice clip
    Thanks
        all good man it was pretty solid
The fuck did I just watch. I can’t wait to get back into console Oh my god.
Stormtrooper
think weve got different ideas of what a banger is 🤣
Impressive
    Thanks
peak champ gameplay right here folks
Wut? Lol
My teammates in ranked
The enemy team all need to delete the game... and YOU... keep practicing.
Good shit man, totally juked him
I suck at this game so bad lol. For some reason single elimination games give me weird anxiety.
Watching siege gameplay from console players is like watching a monkey try to perform brain surgery
The biggest problem with skill based matchmaking is now the game thinks your good rather than your enemy's just sucked. Now you may get put with people seal clubbing in non ranked when the jerks should be playing ranked.
I don’t play this game much. Is that tilted peeking around corners considered best practice?
    Yes definitely! I usually give you a huge advantage as opposed to staying straight
paid actors
    🤫
Shi🥁🥁 aim
What is that lobby
    Aluminum 3
is this console siege?
    Most definitely
I want my 58 seconds back
Apologize to Tom Clancy right now
    He is the one that let it happen. If he was truly angry I would have disconnected from the server. He willed this into existence by making my game crash earlier while playing stand and forcing me into a quick match.
Styrofoam 5 lobbies
What rank is this?????????
    Aluminum 3
        dawg this is fuckin newcomer😭
            No my friend this is quick match
                i know my friend it was a joke.
🥔
Mashed potato 4?
By the grace of God, how are you that inaccurate?
    I'm built different
Amazing what an amazing clip
    The lobbys were tin can 3
    Thanks!
I just don’t understand how . Thanks for the laugh tho
Old boy wood ranked.
how do i get my reticle that small
So we're in copper
    Aluminum 3 baby
I’m mad you wasted my life on waiting for something cool to happen. 
You owe me $10 
$yajeeeb
    Your wrong something cool did happen.... I got the best double kill of me life
This is console right?

No mouse movements look like that.

But geez lol this whole thing.
    Ya controller
This clip is fucking garbage lol
Good but you might wanna turn that sensitivity down way too high
Hop over on fortnight
This gotta be copper
Banger of of a clip, more like bang my head against the wall. Glad you got the win tho, all that matters
Way lobby is that ?!! This is terrible lmaoo
Banger clip standards have fallen in the mud
☹️
This shits so bad I wanna off myself
First guy has no survival instincts second guy accidentally turned his aim assist off
Used condom 47
gddddrrrrr aimm 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
most toxic community
I don’t even play this game that was horrible this is the first clip I’m seeing on this sub
Before I even saw what buttons the screen said were for each throwable I could tell this was console cause the slow leaning direction switches🤣🤘🏻
Glad to see my grandmother is getting better at rainbow six
I would love to watch you try and play counter strike with aim like that lmao
    I actually got counterstrike not too long ago. Haven't played yet though
average controller lobby
This gotta be the most controller user gameplay I’ve ever seen.
So we’re in champ
Woorrrrst clip of the day
Bro got that 2-3 business days reaction time💀
    Nuh uh
Consoles man, they always hit harder than my mnk
I wish my enemies were like this, I have this weird bug where they shoot back
    I just think that the other team was having a glitch where the team is a bunch of dirt 3 autistic apes
Where are these players? How can I find them? Every game I play feels like I am fighting 5 Sam Fishers yet I constantly see these below avg ai clips everywhere.
Dude the extended double kill ?? That was nasty
Is recoil non-existent in the rainbow six universe?

This popped up on my feed from “similar communities”
    No it definitely is. I think I have good recoil control and shit aim
So we’re in champ
this gotta b dirt 3
Lol this game looks so slow and clunky with the movement 🤣🤣🤣🤣
All i hear is jinxy screaming “bad aim bad aim”
Reporting because OP stole my gameplay footage
Best clip of the day
Lol I wish I could get games like that so I can get used to the game again. I tried playing last week and every match was me getting wall banged by John wick.
Finka got outplayed when you ran around that column
    I have no idea what she was looking at or where her headset was
        She was running on stealth game NPC logic, and investigating your last known position
Clip of the day
so we in plastic 4
Mud puddle 6 quality here boys
Proves how garbage this game is
Are you hacking?
Worstclipoftheday
even copper v aint that bad
Your the reason shampoo has instructions
[deleted]
    I found it funny
Why tf did u clip this💀
    Funi
    More to the point, why did you post this?
        Funi
God damn that controller turning always cracks me up lol
This is King shit
Truly the clip of all time
Ba🥁🥁🥁d Aim
Sooooii were in copper
So we’re in copper
So we’re in copper
So we’re in copper
so we’re in copper
So we're in copper.
So we’re in copper
Why don't your guns have recoil?
    I'm just like that
Your  movement and crosshair placement is awful
    Thanks!
        Np
Siege is such a boring game let's hold angles for 5mins guys, yall could never play apex or anything close to a real fps
All the times u got shot at I would had died on Pc, really shows how much of a advantage you have on this game. I’m surprised it doesn’t have aim assist like cod where its flat out aimbotting it’s so good people rather play controller bc of it

You are just bad at this game

    What the fuck Is bro on about. Console players can't play in PC lobbies and PC players can't play in console lobbies. It doesn't even matter. I feel like you're complaining about them having no AA and being able to survive better because they don't get hit but you're also the type of person to complain about AA.
        I’m talking the difference between pc and console goofy on pc all those times he survived he would had most likely died if it was on pc servers bc people actually have decent Aim and u wouldn’t react or be able to turn around fast enough to shoot back unless your champion level
            Again it doesn't matter because both platforms are separated. Besides he didn't have good aim either, pretty sure it's just them being bad and not completely because it's on console.
                It’s harder to aim on console, and it’s pretty easy to tell if someone is zim, because I used to think it wasn’t a big deal but seeings clips like this of how bad or how much worse people are on console it impresses me when I see pros on console that have such good aim
                    It's weird because all the lobbies I get in everyone including me actually has decent aim so I'm not sure why this clip is here.
                    It’s not about controller being bad it’s about the player being bad
                    Bro there are plenty of good players on console dawg, there’s just a lot of bad ones too. Not just pros.
                        dawg
Below mid
any players wanna be my friend? i’m not that good at the game and i don’t rllly have any friends rn
Hop that errru on ROBLOX!!!!
