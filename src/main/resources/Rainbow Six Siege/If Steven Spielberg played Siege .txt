Well I wish I could reply to the young barcode name man but it seems I have been blocked. All I wanted to say is that I apologise that I posted a fun video and it offend you so much that you decided to block and report me for selfharm. I do understand we don't know what happening in someone else's life but there is no need to be so unhappy on a social media platform. From my side I apologise for causing you discomfort. Hope you have a wonderful day
    Good man.
WARDEN⁉️

                Wow I am so scared. More like 39yo boomer desperately looking for attention on reddit. Holy shit  it took ya almost 500 games to hit dia? It took me 25% less games lmao. You're just not interesting to watch and not good at the game. I'd slap the shit out of ya in 1v1, I have a 1.5kd and constantly carrying top500 champs lmao.

                    Oh shut the fuck up you dork
                    >it took me 25% less games

Oh yeah? I hit Diamond in about ~25-30 games every season since Ranked 2.0 came out. If you are so great why does it take you so long to hit Diamond? Should be easy. I’m starting to think maybe you’re not as good as you think you are 🤔
                    Sad individual spends his time bitching on an R6 subreddit. Fuck off ya nerd lmao.
                    Majority of this kid’s comments are all just trying to start something with people, why is this kid even allowed in the sub…

                    >39yo boomer

Lol. Do you even know what a boomer is, or do you think anyone above 18 is a boomer? Are you just jealous that this man is making entertaining content, and all you can do is complain?

                    Hey man, looking at your other comments, you gotta get some help. The way you act, even if it’s online, is pretty disheartening…
                    I didnt ask kid and don’t care honestly why don’t you just stfu.
                    It took you 500 games? Wow what a loser it only took me 400 games!!!

What a fucken loser🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
                    No way you wrote all this and were like, “yeah that sounds badass as fuck.”
                    I'll put you on a T-Shirt. 1v1 shitter.
    Having just looked at the last 24 hours of “hot,” posts in the sub The overwhelming majority is clips of gameplay just like this one.

Have you commented on all the other ones to stop their self-promotion?

Maybe you’re just in the wrong sub altogether.
