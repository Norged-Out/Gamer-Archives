[[That’s just cheating]]





Thought the “that’s just cheating” was in reference to the ability to see all traps and stuff. 

Then I saw the killcam 😂 

Ban Hammer definitely gonna get laid down on that person
    Lmao
    Lmaoo that’s exactly what I thought
    remember when they brought in YouTubers to beta test this game and people complained about PULSE being too op?
        id assume that’s because it’s an ability where it seems busted at first but it’s actual utility, while powerful, is still inconsistent

i’d also compare it to solis off launch where a lot of people thought it was busted due to the capabilities for roaming and counterplant, except it doesn’t exactly translate that way since solis is generally more fluid than pulse due to the higher range

it’s also that there was no meta yet and that if people were playing it with not much an opinion of the options, then they might’ve thought pulse was busted solely because of the utility to see heartbeats (or that it was stronger then, which I don’t know) which while a good pick probably would not take over some other operators, jager, doc, and rook considered just as examples
Wow. This is the most “watch until the end” video I have ever seen.
    Fr
jesus, doesn't even try to hide it.
    I really doubt it’s Jesus of all people
        Haha this made me laugh
        What part of "walking on water" and "5000x fish duplication glitch 2023 still working" made you think he wasnt cheating?
            Bro got admin commands
        Yup but they never said what it was either
Wtf lol
In the most respectful way possible watching you play made me frustrated, impacting the bottom of the door will destroy both and that’s a free kill, make sure not to hesitate on a operator like solis
    I usually play a lot better than this. I’ll have to get a clip, but I’m never that slow.
        We all have our moments
    It was hard to watch not pre aiming or anything just mindlessly walking out to
There was a bug reported several times that killcams are very glitched when person is rapping

What I would recommend to your gameplay: be more confident, in situations like this, if you see someone is on drone, rappel, smash the barricade, impact the claymore, and go. You waited 10 second in total, and broke the barricade fir a long time, if he got off the drone a few seconds after you saw hin droning, he would just pre aim you, and get a free kill. Also, if you throw your impact close enough you can destroy the barricade with the claymore, even after a single punch, making the runout even quicker
    I understand completely what you are saying and the claymores scare the shit out of me and I should’ve had taken that long to go out of the door
        Throw the impact underneath the barricade next time, the splash should break the barricade and the claymore. If you know where they are, just do it and run out like a bat out of hell. Especially with the p90, you can hit a dink and run back in before they even know what happened
            Thank you
            For some reason the P90 feels like a terrible weapon to me. Is it because I aim for the chest instead of the head most of the time?
                I mean it's a close range smg, but from far away if you're just a little accurate, normally you can get a recoil heads hot. But yeah, it's kind of a peashooter otherwise, just try and aim a bit higher, not necessarily for headshots but just upper chest and you might get lucky.
                You should always aim headlevel in siege
                    I do, but when I get into gunfights I tend to aim down to the chest out of fear of missing the head
    Right 😂 he did all that just to get wrecked. He could of simply impact the bottom door and it destroy claymore and door
        He didn’t “get wrecked” there was nothing he could do the guy was cheating
    True but the dude shot thru a solid dmn object tf
        Yeah
            Glitched kill cam, when he runs out you can see the bullets coming from the top not through the walls. This kid is just trash 😂
                I thought the same thing. Op should go back to the actual replay and watch.
I don't understand how this post is so highly rated. It's not cheating, they likely aren't even exploiting. The start of this post literally explains everything. You had such a delay between using your gadget and it actually activating + you rubber banded. His player model (and thus the kill cam) desynced because of your own connection to the server.

Also it's console, you are hardly ever going to find genuine cheaters (excluding MnK, Cronus etc). The one cheat that worked on all platforms, the GPU/ capture card hacks, got absolutely legally choke slammed by Ubisoft. 

TL;DR: no hacks involved, seek an ethernet cable.
    this
looks like lag, cheats dont do that
    Yeah it’s clearly lag. The solis gadget stutters for a weird second, and there’s connectivity issue symbols in the bottom right
It definitely seems more like a desync issue. on his screen he was probably up higher on repel. You can see the bullet trails coming from closer to the window.
i just spent 20 seconds saying "just impact it" more and more aggressive each time just to see you died to a bug and now im just befuddled
    Literally. Bro was making so much noise I was waiting for him to insta die the moment he ran out.
It's a killcam/replay glitch he was repelled happened to me it's no biggie
This is definitely lag/killcam glitch you should’ve impacted the barricade the second you saw him droning on rappel maybe don’t take 30 seconds and make a million sound cues before you run out
He is not cheating. It’s a replay/kill cam bug that’s been around for years. He must have been rappelling or closer to the stairs.
    You can’t see him on the wall at all when he steps out
        just vis bug
Not cheating, people are so dumb
Mm idk… prob just skill issue
    Found the hacker👍
        Figured it obvious that that was meant to be sarcastic humor
I disagree with anyone saying that it is a glitch you can see that solis picked up he was on his phone not on repel
    You saw him with Solis more than 20 seconds prior. Plus I'm pretty sure you can even hear him go on repel at 1:59. This is just a case of unfortunate desync.
    you can repel on phone too tho?!?!
You’re just bad it seems
I swear it's always on chateau too. I had the single most blatant cheater, he swung through walls, like a no clipping spider man with a full auto kali. wasnt headshots only though so phew
It's more like some kind of lag. The bullets come from the roof and in the replay he shoots the ground but not looking at you. So yeah, it's just probably lag.
Why would you cheat on a game this old?
Holy shit he actually was cheating
    No it’s a unfortunate visual glitch that happens lots of times
        Omg kiss me now😫💦

    Thank you for sharing
    😂
R6 players are just straight different.
Does this season feel off to anyone else, between the playlist changes and seemingly more cheaters it just feels off to last season.
Bad him
You sure do love orange huh?
I was going to say you took too long until I saw the replay, but when not going against cheaters, it’s definitely best to speed that process up
What you mean that was a legit kill
On Console too??? That's wild
🤣😂😂😂
Ur on console tho? That’s probably just a bug, it looked like he shot u from the roof
We need to start publicizing the names of cheaters in posts like this
Not cheating! It was a very subtle flick. Not surprised no one saw it
He's just got a better gaming chair
Holy shit can you break the claymore any slower
He was cheating but that’s the most obvious runout I’ve ever seen
what in the hell?
Homeboy said “stay inside”
At first I thought he was just repelled on bedroom window or something and just heard you melee and nade 4 times and I was like, what did you expect? He was waiting for you, but then I saw the killcam
damn
so many things wrong with this video
He’s not cheating 😂🤡 this game sometimes has glitched kill cams. When he runs outs you can see the bullets coming from the top not through the walls, a normal player can hear your goofy self struggling to open a door LOL
Bro you suck pull door open start running impact then peak
bro just has a better gaming chair, skill issue tbh
You’re using a laser pointer.. gross
Hey I’m new to siege do any of y’all got tips
dang
Nah that's not cheating he just has a better gaming chair than you
What the hell is that ability, the new iq? Haven’t played in a while
See the First Mw2 had modded lobbies that let you have way more options then this just looking through buildings with aim bot how is this fun in any way
I can turn a blind eye to this bc he ran out
Skill issue
And this is why I play with cross play off
Slow decision making and just a laggy killcam...
Seems like a skill issue
Skill gapped he's just genuinely better
Nah he just has a good gaming chair
I think he was on rappel and the killcam bugged him onto the ground from your pov
.
Honestly people that runout deserve that
What a cool dude! /s
Ace. 👍
How was ace cheating? I don’t get the caption
Uses game enabled wall hack. Gets actual wall hacked
Yeah nah, two nights ago I ran into a cav that had no hit box apparently even after me and a teammate mag dumped, chat after that round was livid so I bet ur chat was livid if that guy did the same to your team
I didn’t expect that
Skill issue
When did the rainbow Ops get tech thats better than ghosts? Tf?
He just got a good gaming chair,he’s not cheating
Visual bug I think
Blue jackets
he’s not cheating it’s just a random rappel glitch, on your screen (solis) there appears to be no one on the rappel which is a client sided bug that is ubisoft’s fault because they did render the other guy (ace) on the rappel but on ace’s side he did the full animation of the rappel when he got onto it which is why it’s client sided. this happened to me too lol
Cheaters gotta be the most pathetic creatures on the planet lmaoo o
