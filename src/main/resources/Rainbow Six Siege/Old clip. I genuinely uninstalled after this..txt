[[Old clip. I genuinely uninstalled after this.]]





this was me yesterday. It was a 1v4. So embarrassing ü§£
This is the funniest shit I've ever seen
Look at old Hereford! I miss that basement site sometimes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
    You can still play in it
        How?
            Play the situations for some reason they havent changed the maps for hereford base
                man. we lost two maps with the situations and training grounds removal. old Hereford and Bartlett u. damnit...they just gotta ruin the fun of the game with each update.
My gggaaawwwdddd that‚Äôs ridiculous! like how aren‚Äôt you laughing at this still! I‚Äôve only seen this stuff in comedy action flicks. I bet that Boi is still spinning and shooting at 1 foot an hour to this day.
    Definitely laughing now but when it happened I just couldn‚Äôt help but be pissed lol.
        Can't even blame you, if this shit happened to me I would uninstall on the spot.
        I feel that so bad my boy did this in the tub back in the old chalet and missed every bullet point blank range It wasnt me and I unistalled the game
Big lols the slow 180 trick shot
The hit detection in this game makes Battelfield 4 durring launch week look like a masterpiece
    The hit detection is really accurate... Play the video slower
    Launch week ?
I'm currently at work and cannot stop laughing at this lmaooo. Everyone looking at me like i'm crazy
Ah the good ol days when ash had no hit box
This game used to be so pretty. What the hell happened?
    Most likely competitive players complaining about shadows so they stripped the game of any beauty so it can look dull and "visible".
        hurr durr, someone hid behind body we have to rmeove them now!!
    That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying
Ah i miss old rainbow
The freeze frame while seeing "YO IM BOB 628" above the head is killing me right now haha.
It‚Äôs Ash, you stood no chance.
    it was bob 628, it was over before the match had even begun
He sauced on you so hard and it was a fucking accident lmao
Old Hereford god I miss you
Lol
Brooo what I really thought I would've seen it all from siege but im baffled by seeing this smh
Till this day the hit boxes are still fucked üòÇ
This didn‚Äôt make sense until I realized it was ash
how on gods green earth did any of her shots hit you
The true gameplay of siege is learning to overcome the constant storm of bullshit that is Ubisoft
I would uninstall too if I got killed by YO IM BOB 628
I don't give a fuck what anyone says, this version of the game looks 10x better than what we have now.

And I didn't even start playing this early, so you can't say I'm nostalgic about it. I started in the very beginning of Burnt Horizon, when the lighting was already updated.

Siege fell off.
Aimlabs is free
Ahhh, back when siege didn't look like a Fortnite reboot. Good ole days.

    Surly this is a copypasta??
        I thought it was too. They're referencing stuff that just isn't true. Shotguns got a huge buff on the new season release.

                    I do not disagree that siege is not nearly as good as it once was. I just found your comment chaotic and amusing
                        [removed]
                            I think they hit Ash maybe twice. The rest were whiffs.
    Bro, learn to use a fucking comma.
    I didn't know they let children play Siege

            My God and there are 22 of you
The muzzle flash off the plywood looked really good. On my phone screen for a split second I thought this was like edited gopro footage to look like a fps
Wtf lol
that is the funniest clip i think i‚Äôve ever seen
Back when the game was fun bc it was simple
I would‚Äôve yeeted my whole setup üòÇüòÇ
Cheaters suck
I really want to try old siege
HUH?????????
This is pretty much every one of my deaths anymore. Most of the killcams I watch are people holding the trigger down and hoping to hit me. And they usually hit my head.
Old hardford ‚ù§Ô∏è
I miss old Hereford base
Till this day the hit boxes are still fucked üòÇ
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.  
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).  
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.  
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because OP was already dead.
Haven't played the game but is siege even fun?
Looks like you found out the hard way how bad Ashe's hit box used to be
LMAO
Console clips always make me slightly concerned
i this feel so much i remember playing years ago and nothing scared me more than new players especially when the game had its free weeks. new players were so unpredictable and they were always getting lucky headshots and wall bangs off me.
LMFAOOO
How is that possible w/ hacks?
Why does old siege look so much better?!?
You can still play in it
