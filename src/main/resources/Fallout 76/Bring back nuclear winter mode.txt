[[Bring back nuclear winter mode]]


The title says it all. With the tv series coming out, the servers finally have enough players for nuclear winter 2.0. Bring it back, it was the best mode in the game. People stopped playing it because there were no directions or tutorials. People didnâ€™t know that you could build a camp blueprint and use it in the final zones.


The question is "are the people on the servers wanting to play battle royale or are they wanting to play Fallout". People stopped playing it because the number of people wanting to play PvP is rather low, to the point where they outright removed entire quests from the main game since no one wanted to do them.
Yeah it kills me they never even released the other 2 NW maps. The problem is They used those servers for custom and private worlds though. Bethesda isnt gonna take those servers away from people paying for them to give players something for free
