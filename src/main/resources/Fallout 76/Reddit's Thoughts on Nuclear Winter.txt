[[Reddit's Thoughts on Nuclear Winter]]


Hi guys, I hope you can help me.

I want to make a video on 'Reddit's Thoughts on Nuclear Winter' and have a bunch of input from the community.

It's all well and good sifting through posts but all I want is a short explanation of people's thoughts from a couple of days in Nuclear Winter.

Any help you could give would be massively appreciated.

I look forward to your input, Wastelanders!


I’ve noticed that the player base, who like the game, were very sceptical of NW before it was released and have found themselves surprised at how much they like it. I include myself in that group. People who already disliked the game were unlikely to be swayed to liking it it by the mode.
    I would put myself in the same boat there; I was a skeptic but this has fully converted me! - I'm glad you're enjoying it, have you sunk many hours in yet?
        A bit. I’m really really bad at it though!
            Haha, likewise! Just about to hit Level 10 after a 7 Kill - 2nd placement!
    I downloaded the free play on Xbox last night so I’ll get my first try at it tonight, I liked the other fallout games but decided to pass because of the criticism but gonna go in with a clear mind of that.
        I played it when it first came out, was kinda eh about it. I went back when Wild Appalachia came out and have been hooked ever since. An open 
mind is good, there’s good in there, but no question there’s faults and bugs too. And almost to a woman or man every player that likes it is excited for NPCs coming in, so even fans miss that aspect of the game.
            Ye idk I’m kinda of the type of player that just plays through the bugs, takes a lot for me to consider something broken....coming from anthem and division on Xbox and I have them the most lol
                God, yeah I get that! They had a very rocky launch! Glad you've put that aside though and gave it a blast!
                    Haha free play days, it’s gonna have to earn my money lol nuclear winter could tho depending on how it goes
                        Interesting take! Thank you for your input and hopefully I'll see you in Appalachia, my GT is the same as my username if you wanna have a game or two?
                            Haha I’m west coast US so odds are you’ll be sleeping by the time I’m on, but I’ll send you a FR just in case the stars align lol
            Yeah, I feel you! After dropping £175 on the PA Edition, I felt obliged too, although not too happy about it as more problems came up. Recently though, with the new content I've loved it! Are you holding out for NPCs or are you jumping back into it for some Nuclear Winter?
        Always good to leave other's opinions behind and give something a try for yourself! I hope you enjoy it as much as a lot of us have!
    Yep me too. I hated Fallout 76 at launch and uninstalled in January, and I hated the idea of NW when it was announced. However, I've been playing Nuclear Wasteland non-stop for the last couple of days. Super fun.
        It's an absolute blast! I love it! Have you played much AM or have any plans to play it again soon?
            AM as in adventure mode? Probably not until Wastelanders comes out. I have done most of the stuff in the base game and I'd rather come back fresh after a year off with a shit tonne of new content to do. Wild Appalachia was cool but from what I read didn't have THAT much content.
                Yeah, my bad! AM as in Adventure Mode! That's fair enough though, I'm sure a lot of people will do what they did with NW and jump back into it when Wastelanders drops with the NPCs! Thank you for your feedback though!
I always try to like Fallout 76, but it just inspires me to play Fallout 4 for another round. I tried Nuclear Winter, and thought it was fine for that sort of game mode. I just wonder how many people will be tricked into buying this game thinking that Nuclear Winter is already in the game. Might be a fresh batch of angries next week.
    I did consider this myself seeing as there's no information beyond the end of the trial week! - Did NW make you want to return somewhat however?
        It did make me want to return. I returned to try it, and then gave adventure mode a go. Traveled across the map to a quest, and was a bit frustrated to hear my quest giver, a codsworth, tell me to go gather ingredients for some sort of dish. I didn't really want to play chef, so I started a fresh Fallout 4 play through. I still want to like Fallout 76 for some reason, so maybe I'll give it another try when the NPC update rolls around. NW won't keep me around, never really cared for the PVP in Fallout 76.
            No, I wholeheartedly understand that! Definitely isn't enough to stick around for if you aren't overly keen from the get go. I like AM and NW but much prefer NW and I solely started playing again for it! Hope to see you back in Appalachia soon though!
Compared to other battle royale games it does have various issues. Frame rate during gun fights can be rough at times. I've had a number of lag issues and the game has crashed mid-game. 

Also there is a bug with the 50. Lmg that causes you to continually fire even if you aren't holding the trigger which makes you waste ammo and reveal yourself.

Outside of that the game mode is fun.
    I have noticed a few frame drops that can cause issues with the gameplay but no crashes thankfully! I've also only had a Gatling Gun carry on shooting a second or two after I stopped, which wasn't great but it hasn't happened since.

There is a few problems to iron out but I'm hoping 'post beta' will bring those fixes!
        Yeah at first me and my brother were frustrated with the game thinking this was a full legit release but knowing it's not even in beta makes me very hopeful in the future over how it will play. 

It'll be difficult to beat Apex Legends which has a ton of quality of life changes that make it more appealing to people who like battle royale. But this being a fallout twist will definitely keep people interested.
            Yeah, it's not the cleanest experience but to be fair to them, like you say, it's a Fallout twist. - Something to at least spice up the game a bit!
You're going to get very different responses from this sub and the Fo76 specific sub.
    Of course! That's the plan, I'll factor that in too! Have you played much of yet and if so, thoughts on it?
Long backstory first but here goes: 


I played FO76 for about 2 months after launch but gave up because there was no content. I reinstalled shortly before Wild Appalachia started and I’ve been playing every week since. Usually not a ton because there’s still just not that much content, but between survival challenge weapons, pretty much weekly content drops (up until a few weeks ago), I was spending at least 5-10 hours a week. Since NW came out, I’ve been playing 2-4 hours every DAY. 


This mode is so much damn fun in my opinion. It has great replayability and a good rewards system compared to pretty much any other content in adventure mode. It’s a really great addition to the game and I’m super surprised at how well made it was. PvP sucks in adventure and survival but it feels really good here. I’m super hyped for Wastelanders to come out with some traditional Fallout content but in the meantime, this was the best case scenario. A fun, well-designed mode that’ll keep me busy until then (plus vault raids soon, which will hopefully be as well-made as this).
    Wow, that was very insightful! Thank you so much! I was the same, I always dipped in and out but since the new content roadmap started, I've been on it a tonne! It is an absolute blast though, I do love this mode! I'm just hoping they keep updating it! Are you going to continue sinking time into it even when the new content drops or will you just use it to pass time until then?
        I’ll keep playing probably until I get all the rewards but unless they add more rewards past level 100 (which I think is the last rank with known rewards) I’ll probably stop playing there. Maybe I’ll hop in if friends want to play but I expect that by that point I’ll be pretty bored of the mode and won’t have any incentive to keep going after that. I don’t know when I’ll reach that rank, but I’m going to keep playing until I do even if it’s after Wastelanders drops (or if I get extremely bored before then I’ll stop but I feel like I won’t because this is just such so much fun to play right now).


Good luck on your video!
            Right on, man! Keep grinding whilst you enjoy it and I'm sure it'll be a good time! Thank you, goull have to check it out when it's done! Should be this week!
I personally think it's great sounding. I haven't played nw yet, but I think that this will be nice. I just hope that they don't revert to all their work on this.
    It's awesome that you like the sound of it without even playing it yet! They must have done something right!
        Well I just know from my experience that 76 was great and surprised me, so I think it will surprise me and be great again
            Well put, be sure to give it a go and get back to me if/whenever you have time! Enjoy Appalachia!
                I will.
Making a PvP gamemode with fallouts clunky feel doesn’t work. The sensitivity in fallout is so off compared to other games.
    This was always a concern, at least one for me, it's not a notoriously fluid game and little bits here and there show that again. Have you played much of it and do you still play Adventure Mode?
        I played for like an hour. And no I haven’t played adventure mode.
I would enjoy seeing a link to your channel, i want to see the video you post, sounds like it could be a rather interesting topic!
    Of course, I appreciate that! You can find it below!

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX7zRZ0eUl_Fe9I-dqjugLA

There will of course be other content for Fallout in the coming days!
Awesome!!!!’ F076 is back baby!!!
    Haha! That's the spirit!!! You enjoying NW and come back or have you been a supporter or regular player through the good and bad?
Almost makes me just want a deathmatch mode. 
 
 Just do what Operation Anchorage did and have it all be a simulation designed to help the Americans fight the Chinese. 

 You'd have to make new maps but I don't think it'd be too hard to do.
    That honestly sounds like something they do after they release wastelanders.
        I really do hope so! Is there anything after this and NPCs you'd want next?
            I want an eyebot companion that follows me around, even if it doesn't do anything and is purely cosmetic I'm still wantvit anyway
                I didn't know I wanted this until now! That would be awesome or like a dog or something to travel with you like ESO, that would be cool!
                    like it wouldn't even have to do anything you could have different skins for the eyebot to make it into a balloon that follows you around or a miniature cargo bot, and you could do that with other animals that could just follow you around cosmetically like a squirrel friend or opossum friend or a beaver friend etc.
    I have thought about a deathmatch mode or even like a horde mode, that would be fun! Would be great additions!
I was dreading it when the leaks came out, but I thought it would kill some time until Wastelanders which lets face It, everyone knew was gonna be NPCs.

Surprisingly, I've absolutely loved it so far. I also know a spawn route that gives me 3 yellow crates, 5 blue crates, and 2 black crates (No, I'm not sharing my secrets) so I usually end up within the top 6.
    Well my DMs are open if you wanna share the loot! ;) Have you played a lot of it by now? - Also I believe you're the first to mention it as a way to kill time before the next DLC and personally I hadn't thought for even a moment about the next DLC being NPCs, prior to the announcement of course!
I have play Fallout 76 since it came out and have toughed through it since the beginning. I thought  based on the size of the map they would do a Battle Royale eventually and I was skeptical cause I dont like that type of game. But it puts everyone on an even playing field no matter the skill level or player level. Its also interesting that thereis regular Adventure Mode, Survival Mode, and now Nuclear Winter so a lot of options to play for just one game. So I enjoy it a lot, maybe not my teammates cause I did accidentally dropped a nuke on a allies forehead the other day.
    Haha! Brilliant! I'm guessing he was no longer a team mate of yours after that and instead was a grilled corpse?

I'm definitely glad they handled balance the way they did, truth be told I haven't played Survival for that reason but like you say, it's great there's so much to do now! I'm glad you like the additions and  stuck through it!
So far so good, never liked pubg to much run run sniped, fortnight to much cartoon, apex prefer hit-scan, and now I’m actually liking NW
    Much like myself, couldn't get to grips with the others for similar reasons but this is a welcome change! Will it stand the test of time and keep players interested though?
My only complaint thus far is the perk point system and how your SPECIAL stats are that of your adventure character.  Im all for playing NW but dislike how I need to level up in adventure if im to max out my SPECIAL stats in order to equip better cards.
    Yeah, there was always going to be a catch with using one character for all! They could have avoided it and made it skill and luck based in terms of RNG and whatnot but it's a real shame for sure. - Have you overlooked this though and put much time into the game's new mode?
        I have, yeah.  Despite not being able to fully enjoy the perk card system I still enjoy playing for all the rest that it offers.
I personally kinda felt like fo76 was trash, went back wth a clear mind for free Xbox week thing, I love BR and stuff, I love fallout but dang, it’s laggy af and just buggy and they really need to tackle these issues imo before they move on to other stuff. (Also I have no problems with frame rate or anything else as I have a XBOX...)
    I've not had major issues, just some slight performance hiccups persay, unsure whether mine are internet or game based though. Sorry you didn't have a great first experience! Will you give it a go if it improves after the pre-beta period is finished and it becomes a full game mode? Also do you like what you have seen when it does work?
        I’m kind of in the middle, I actually am trying to push through some of the bugs in regular adventure mode but honestly i already explored the whole map back in beta and I find myself not caring enough to get back on and play. I think after wastelanders comes out I’ll give it one more shot!!!
            It's weird I actually just spent the majority of today cruising through Adventure Mode but a few moments did frustrate me but I swore to myself I'd have a break from NW! - Hopefully Wastelanders can retain your interest!
It's...there. That's all I can say.

I have been enjoying the base game a lot though.
    Ah, I'm glad you're enjoying the base game still! Have you put much time into Nuclear Winter at all or is it not for you?
[removed]
    Well I hope it's good and brings you back! Based on the DLC so far, I believe it will be! Are you enjoying NW though or is it just that game has already set a low bar and it's just something for you to enjoy in the meantime?
As someone who likes Fallout 76 in general, I thought that the idea of it was stupid and it wasn't going to be good at all. After trying it, despite me being absolute trash, I love it.
    Myself and many others it seems are in the same boat with you there, pal! Minus Apex I wasn't a massive BR fan but this was a good addition! I personally am curious to see if it can hold its own and if it keeps being updated over time! I'm glad you're enjoying it though!
        I completely agree, the only BR games I've liked are; Nuclear Winter, Apex Legends, and Minecraft:Hunger Games. I'm excited for them to work on it more and release a full version. My only complaints are that matches are to short for the time to get in them, and I occasionally glitch so that no button does anything besides open the menu to quit.
            After cursing myself last night, I experienced my first game breaking glitch when reviving someone, the Power Armor I was in entered an animation and never finished it, it just locked up, I could back out of the game fully or just let the storm take me so I waited. It will be brilliant when it's polished up a bit!
                Yeah that's happened to me once. For me it mostly happens when I exit the map and try to open my pipboy to quick, it's like the game doesn't like it so it just locks up.
It's alot of fun surprisingly,  a welcome one
    Awesome stuff! I'm glad you're enjoying it! Did you get to play much of the base game with all the new content or was this reason for you to boot the game up again?
        I only played the beta of the base game, and that was enough for me at t that point to not buy it at launch and after seeing every other issues that came with it after the fact im glad I didnt do it.  But now at this point and at this stage and with also the BR mode added I'm quite likely to buy it and play both the base game and Nuclear winter after the free week trial runs out.
            Wow that's brill! Glad to see you're back in Appalachia! - At least you'll join on a much cleaner and smoother experience! :)
I'm playing with the free trial and it's been a lot of fun I even won a few games, I have no idea now to access anything I won tho,  is it just perk card packs?
    It's perk card packs which appear to only be for this mode, I could be wrong though! There's also stuff for Adventure Mode like items for your camp, icons, etc! Do you think you'll get the game after this week or will you wait beyond the sales and for the addition of even more content?
        I am having a good time so far, but yeah I think I'll give it some time before I really sink my teeth into it. I'm enjoying where the game is headed and think the aspect of reclaiming the wastes is a good one. The idea of running around with buddies and hookin and jabbin across West Appalachia is something has always been what draws me in, so I'm sure in time I'll definitely be back on later down the line, as a humble trader.
            Well I hope to see you back in Appalachia, pal! - Good to see you'll give it another chance!
It's a surprisingly good BR, but it suffers a lot of the bugs and problems that go along with the main game. Gunplay is pretty terrible and performance is abysmal on PC for me. With some improvement it could be really good
    Yeah, it's definitely a shame but without being a standalone game, I think it's part and parcel of it coming packaged with Fallout 76. - Will you come back after the pre-beta has finished or maybe even play some of the Adventure Mode in the meantime?
I love it, so fun
    I'm so glad you're having fun with it! Did you play much base game or did this bring you back?
        Oh yeah, I’ve been playing constantly since launch. I love fallout 76. For the last few months I’ve mainly been doing PVP in survival, there’s a huge advantage there if you have good gear. The beauty of NW is it equals the playing field, as well as gives advantage to teams that work together. I also love the decision making involved. Do I engage? Do I revive? Do I need to find better loot? It’s so fun, and how PVP was meant to be
            That's a nice breathe of fresh air, it's awesome you stuck through it all! Hopefully it's paid off for you! Thank you for the comparisons on the other modes too and how you've played it prior to this! - I hope you continue to enjoy Appalachia!
A battle royale in the fallout universe is a great idea and would work really well, but pumping resources into developing it instead of fixing the mess that has been FO 76 just makes me more reluctant to buy it because it seems like they will never really fix their initial problems.
    Of course, that's perfectly fair! Do you reckon you'll ever pick it up again and dive in and what would that take?
        I actually never played it, after the initial bad reception I decided to wait a while
I was one of the few that seemed to not be in an uproar over the BR mode before it was actually released. It seems that many people are quick to judge things lately long before they get their hands on it. Just keep an open mind and give things a shot when you actually are able to!

With all that said, I've actually had a really good time playing it. I am not a huge BR fan, but Adventure and Survival mode began becoming sort of stale for me. It's definitely a nice change up for now. Although seeing all the updates coming is what keeps me excited for the future of the game!
    I admittedly was part of that crowd and definitely regret it; especially seeing how well the mode turned out! - If you know roughly, can you guess how many hours you put in before it started getting stale and was it just the game that got boring or did the issues that came with it put you off too?
        I've put over 300 hours into the game, so I'm sure it's just that I've done basically all of the content. Of course it's the new events and items they release that keeps me coming back. I will say that the big reason I still play so much is because I'm always on with my best friend. We always wanted a fallout co-op game so 76 really scratches that itch.
            That's really nice to hear! It must be cool just sinking hours into it with a buddy! Thank you for getting back to me though, helps a lot!
                No problem! I will say that without my buddy playing, I probably wouldn't have put in 300 hours by now. Maybe more like 200. But I still enjoy playing solo too. It's just way easier to put in a ton of hours in a day when we play.
I love the mode. My only issues with it are technical-- frame rates, environmental collisions (getting stuck on so much shit constantly!!!), stuff other BRs have sorted since they were built around the mode, that 76 will have to tweak to make smoother. I think its super fun though.  
Personally I've also encountered issues where I couldn't select or see spawn locations of my team mates at start, that happened once. Not sure if that was a client issue or a controller issue, as I do use an XBox controller to play the game on PC.
    >I love the mode. My only issues with it are technical-- frame rates, environmental collisions (getting stuck on so much shit constantly!!!), stuff other BRs have sorted since they were built around the mode, that 76 will have to tweak to make smoother. I think its super fun though.

Don't tell people you use an *Xbox* controller for PC on the internet!!! Haha! Yeah, there is a few issues, especially getting stuck, I get that a lot. Even playing Adventure Mode today, I've realised it happens a lot less there for some reason.  (Maybe different areas, interiors, etc. but still!)
        Bwahahaha I know, I play all my other games with my keyboard and mouse but for some reason, Fallout just feels better on a controller. T_T lol.
I think I'm in a weird space where I thought it was ok but only played for like 3 hours at launch and deleted it soon after to make space for other games, and it wasn'quite my cup of tea . I came back cos I was interested in the full PvP experience, and I'm really enjoying it, especially with the large variety of weapons you can get in quick succession.
    That's definitely a new take on this whole thing! It's great that they've managed to pull you back though, especially now there's so much for you to enjoy if you do decide to go back to Adventure Mode at some point!
Actually only played fallout 3 and 4, but just got on that trial for 76 and damn it’s amazing!!! Debating on getting the tricentennial or just the regular. On Xbox they are both 50% off. But yeah after watching all the negative YouTube videos when the game launched I got turned off. But after e3 and that trial I am hyped.


Yeah nw is a fun lil mode to mess around with.
    Unrelated but I did do a video on the stuff in the Tricentennial Edition which may help! With the sale though, it's worth it! - So glad you're enjoying it and coming from the free trial!
        Link?
            Here you go, Sir: https://youtu.be/OjL7omLk5a0
                Nice! Thanks
                    No problem; thank you for checking it out! Hope it helps you!
    lolwut

If you're gonna buy a shitty game like Fallout 76 don't settle for 50% off.

Amazon has it for $17, Walmart has it for $17.

Damn fools and their digital copies. One of these days people will learn.

Walmart has the Tricentennial edition for $20. All that edition does is give you some shitty cosmetic skins.

A $3 charge for those shitty skins is much more appropriate than the $20 ShitThesda tried to get at launch.
        Idc digital is the way to go. Why leave the house when I could just download the game? Been fully digital since 2017 over 40 games. #JumpIn the future of gaming. Just like music,  discs will be a thing of the past. Just look at game pass. Ok bye.
        Ah I'm sorry you're not overly impressed by the Tricentennial Edition content! I'd have to agree somewhat about digital copies, you can't beat having a case to display and a physical disc to take to a friend's house or whatever! I got the content as I preordered the PA Edition and it just happened to come with it! If you don't mind me asking, have you played the new mode or are you not returning until further additions are made?
Im not a fan of BR games to start with but I still gave it a chance. That being said, I think I would rather play any other Battle Royale game.

I dont see it lasting that long. For one no one is unironically going to buy FO76 Battle Royale, FO76 isnt selling anymore copies, everyone who hasn't bought it by now, never will. Two, the community is too small, even now when its free to play it still takes much longer to actually find games than other BR games, after free weekend and everyone gets bored of it, itll be forgotten. The game was never designed for Battle Royale gameplay, and after the hype dies down, people will move away from it.
    I have mentioned this in a few other responses, the loads times and all the waiting make it feel like an afterthought not a fluid part of the game you can just drop into. - Did you own 76 before this or did you hop onto it with the Trial Week?
Nuclear winter is a shitty cash grab,same as 76. Bethesda has took that series and fucking destroyed it.
    Did you not enjoy 76 and has this just added 'insult to injury' or did you remotely enjoy it from launch, etc?
        "Facebook and YouTube are my main source of news"

This is a sub for hating on anything that deviates from FO2.  Try over at /r/fo76, they're a bit more likely to have actually played the game.
            Thank you for the feedback, I had the the same response on r/fo76 regarding here however! Can't hurt to have both sides, although that will be a factor explored in the video it seems! - Have you yourself played it if you don't mind my asking?
                500 hours or so total in 76.  Probably 1000 in FO4, not sure about 3 and NV, but a fair amount.  I'm not a big fan of the NW part, because I suck at PvP, but I've been impressed with the little bit I have played (Just made rank 2 while you were waiting for my reply, so maybe 45 minutes)

Great stuff! Hardcore fan then? ;) It's cool that you're not massively into it but respect what they have done with it! :)
                        I didn't really get into the franchise until about a year after FO4 came out.  I watched a streamer playing it and was intrigued, picked it up later and just loved playing it.  Picked up older ones to play through just to experience them.  I even waited a month or so after 76 came out before I picked it up.

I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore fan.  People that have FO tattoos...yeah that's hardcore.  I'm most certainly a fan though.
                            That's great! A lot of people came in through Fallout 4! Weird of you to mention I do actually have a tattoo of Vault Boy on my forearm! Haha! I'll try and remember to include it in the video to show you! :')
                    What system are you on? I know some pretty good loot routes if you're on ps4 and want to squad up.
                        PC, and my schedule is crap so I never know when I'll be playing anyway.  Thanks for the offer though!
                        Gotta love this community! Nice of you to offer! <3
            If you look in a thread like this that asks for opinions, you’ll see every other one upvoted but the moment someone gives a negative one then immediately they get all of their news from fake sources and get downvoted.

This thread is like the 76 sub. Downvote anything negative and pretend anyone who didn’t like it is in the wrong.
                If you go back even a couple months, you couldn't open your mouth about 76 here without getting down-voted unless you were shit talking it.  Right now it seems to be swinging the other way, but it seems relatively civil unless you just spew bile without decent reasoning.

The 76 sub is definitely a fan sub, but I'm not sure I'd expect otherwise.  And civil complaints are very well tolerated.

I'll be frank, the game isn't nearly that bad, though it's not totally great.  The new mode seems to be well liked though.  And I think it's a whole lot less deserving of the vitriol than it was at launch.
                    Well put! I'm trying my best to take in as much as I can and see both sides, I like it and nothing will change that for the moment! I'll definitely be sure to include your take on this as a broader look though! Do you have any experience with the new mode, if so how have you found it?
                Of course, I understand there'll always be bias and protection over stuff people like. It's human nature sadly but it doesn't mean we can't have a good conversation about this! I'm replying to everyone and looking at every side of this! Do you care to share your experience with the new mode at all?
                    Tbh, I’ll probably never play 76 again. If they release private servers and mods then maybe but as it stands now, it’s a very clunky game built on an engine that already felt clunky in 2004.
                        That's a fair enough comment, sucks that you don't feel like you can play it again! Hopefully once servers and mods are added you can jump back in!
                            Adding mods directly contradict their cheap and reused assets they sell in their shop. Mods ruin the whole ‘games as a service’ model they’ve set up.

There’s many great games to play and as someone with a career and a healthy life, I just can’t justify playing a mediocre game in this lifetime more than I already have.
        Ive never enjoyed it. Its a bugging mess. Spent my whole check on it and fell through the damn map 30 minutes into the game. Its a bs cash grab and always will be.
            I'm sorry it wasn't what you had hoped for! - I haven't been unfortunate as to experience any glitches as such, that's a real shame. Thank you for your feedback though!
                You are just about the nicest person on this subreddit. If i say anything that isnt praising 76, i get hailed with insults and a storm of down votes. Im just gonna leave this subreddit. Its literally being turned into r/fo76
                    No, of course! People can be very defensive of something they enjoy! Sometimes too much so! All the best though!
            [deleted]
                At points I personally found all the new content a little overwhelming but that's only due to the sheer amount added! - It definitely got better from Jan-Feb onwards!
I would put myself in the same boat there; I was a skeptic but this has fully converted me! - I'm glad you're enjoying it, have you sunk many hours in yet?
    A bit. I’m really really bad at it though!
        Haha, likewise! Just about to hit Level 10 after a 7 Kill - 2nd placement!
I downloaded the free play on Xbox last night so I’ll get my first try at it tonight, I liked the other fallout games but decided to pass because of the criticism but gonna go in with a clear mind of that.
    I played it when it first came out, was kinda eh about it. I went back when Wild Appalachia came out and have been hooked ever since. An open 
mind is good, there’s good in there, but no question there’s faults and bugs too. And almost to a woman or man every player that likes it is excited for NPCs coming in, so even fans miss that aspect of the game.
        Ye idk I’m kinda of the type of player that just plays through the bugs, takes a lot for me to consider something broken....coming from anthem and division on Xbox and I have them the most lol
            God, yeah I get that! They had a very rocky launch! Glad you've put that aside though and gave it a blast!
                Haha free play days, it’s gonna have to earn my money lol nuclear winter could tho depending on how it goes
                    Interesting take! Thank you for your input and hopefully I'll see you in Appalachia, my GT is the same as my username if you wanna have a game or two?
                        Haha I’m west coast US so odds are you’ll be sleeping by the time I’m on, but I’ll send you a FR just in case the stars align lol
        Yeah, I feel you! After dropping £175 on the PA Edition, I felt obliged too, although not too happy about it as more problems came up. Recently though, with the new content I've loved it! Are you holding out for NPCs or are you jumping back into it for some Nuclear Winter?
    Always good to leave other's opinions behind and give something a try for yourself! I hope you enjoy it as much as a lot of us have!
Yep me too. I hated Fallout 76 at launch and uninstalled in January, and I hated the idea of NW when it was announced. However, I've been playing Nuclear Wasteland non-stop for the last couple of days. Super fun.
    It's an absolute blast! I love it! Have you played much AM or have any plans to play it again soon?
        AM as in adventure mode? Probably not until Wastelanders comes out. I have done most of the stuff in the base game and I'd rather come back fresh after a year off with a shit tonne of new content to do. Wild Appalachia was cool but from what I read didn't have THAT much content.
            Yeah, my bad! AM as in Adventure Mode! That's fair enough though, I'm sure a lot of people will do what they did with NW and jump back into it when Wastelanders drops with the NPCs! Thank you for your feedback though!
I did consider this myself seeing as there's no information beyond the end of the trial week! - Did NW make you want to return somewhat however?
    It did make me want to return. I returned to try it, and then gave adventure mode a go. Traveled across the map to a quest, and was a bit frustrated to hear my quest giver, a codsworth, tell me to go gather ingredients for some sort of dish. I didn't really want to play chef, so I started a fresh Fallout 4 play through. I still want to like Fallout 76 for some reason, so maybe I'll give it another try when the NPC update rolls around. NW won't keep me around, never really cared for the PVP in Fallout 76.
        No, I wholeheartedly understand that! Definitely isn't enough to stick around for if you aren't overly keen from the get go. I like AM and NW but much prefer NW and I solely started playing again for it! Hope to see you back in Appalachia soon though!
I have noticed a few frame drops that can cause issues with the gameplay but no crashes thankfully! I've also only had a Gatling Gun carry on shooting a second or two after I stopped, which wasn't great but it hasn't happened since.

There is a few problems to iron out but I'm hoping 'post beta' will bring those fixes!
    Yeah at first me and my brother were frustrated with the game thinking this was a full legit release but knowing it's not even in beta makes me very hopeful in the future over how it will play. 

It'll be difficult to beat Apex Legends which has a ton of quality of life changes that make it more appealing to people who like battle royale. But this being a fallout twist will definitely keep people interested.
        Yeah, it's not the cleanest experience but to be fair to them, like you say, it's a Fallout twist. - Something to at least spice up the game a bit!
Of course! That's the plan, I'll factor that in too! Have you played much of yet and if so, thoughts on it?
Wow, that was very insightful! Thank you so much! I was the same, I always dipped in and out but since the new content roadmap started, I've been on it a tonne! It is an absolute blast though, I do love this mode! I'm just hoping they keep updating it! Are you going to continue sinking time into it even when the new content drops or will you just use it to pass time until then?
    I’ll keep playing probably until I get all the rewards but unless they add more rewards past level 100 (which I think is the last rank with known rewards) I’ll probably stop playing there. Maybe I’ll hop in if friends want to play but I expect that by that point I’ll be pretty bored of the mode and won’t have any incentive to keep going after that. I don’t know when I’ll reach that rank, but I’m going to keep playing until I do even if it’s after Wastelanders drops (or if I get extremely bored before then I’ll stop but I feel like I won’t because this is just such so much fun to play right now).


Good luck on your video!
        Right on, man! Keep grinding whilst you enjoy it and I'm sure it'll be a good time! Thank you, goull have to check it out when it's done! Should be this week!
It's awesome that you like the sound of it without even playing it yet! They must have done something right!
    Well I just know from my experience that 76 was great and surprised me, so I think it will surprise me and be great again
        Well put, be sure to give it a go and get back to me if/whenever you have time! Enjoy Appalachia!
            I will.
This was always a concern, at least one for me, it's not a notoriously fluid game and little bits here and there show that again. Have you played much of it and do you still play Adventure Mode?
    I played for like an hour. And no I haven’t played adventure mode.
Of course, I appreciate that! You can find it below!

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX7zRZ0eUl_Fe9I-dqjugLA

There will of course be other content for Fallout in the coming days!
Haha! That's the spirit!!! You enjoying NW and come back or have you been a supporter or regular player through the good and bad?
That honestly sounds like something they do after they release wastelanders.
    I really do hope so! Is there anything after this and NPCs you'd want next?
        I want an eyebot companion that follows me around, even if it doesn't do anything and is purely cosmetic I'm still wantvit anyway
            I didn't know I wanted this until now! That would be awesome or like a dog or something to travel with you like ESO, that would be cool!
                like it wouldn't even have to do anything you could have different skins for the eyebot to make it into a balloon that follows you around or a miniature cargo bot, and you could do that with other animals that could just follow you around cosmetically like a squirrel friend or opossum friend or a beaver friend etc.
I have thought about a deathmatch mode or even like a horde mode, that would be fun! Would be great additions!
Well my DMs are open if you wanna share the loot! ;) Have you played a lot of it by now? - Also I believe you're the first to mention it as a way to kill time before the next DLC and personally I hadn't thought for even a moment about the next DLC being NPCs, prior to the announcement of course!
Haha! Brilliant! I'm guessing he was no longer a team mate of yours after that and instead was a grilled corpse?

I'm definitely glad they handled balance the way they did, truth be told I haven't played Survival for that reason but like you say, it's great there's so much to do now! I'm glad you like the additions and  stuck through it!
Much like myself, couldn't get to grips with the others for similar reasons but this is a welcome change! Will it stand the test of time and keep players interested though?
Yeah, there was always going to be a catch with using one character for all! They could have avoided it and made it skill and luck based in terms of RNG and whatnot but it's a real shame for sure. - Have you overlooked this though and put much time into the game's new mode?
    I have, yeah.  Despite not being able to fully enjoy the perk card system I still enjoy playing for all the rest that it offers.
I've not had major issues, just some slight performance hiccups persay, unsure whether mine are internet or game based though. Sorry you didn't have a great first experience! Will you give it a go if it improves after the pre-beta period is finished and it becomes a full game mode? Also do you like what you have seen when it does work?
    I’m kind of in the middle, I actually am trying to push through some of the bugs in regular adventure mode but honestly i already explored the whole map back in beta and I find myself not caring enough to get back on and play. I think after wastelanders comes out I’ll give it one more shot!!!
        It's weird I actually just spent the majority of today cruising through Adventure Mode but a few moments did frustrate me but I swore to myself I'd have a break from NW! - Hopefully Wastelanders can retain your interest!
Ah, I'm glad you're enjoying the base game still! Have you put much time into Nuclear Winter at all or is it not for you?
Well I hope it's good and brings you back! Based on the DLC so far, I believe it will be! Are you enjoying NW though or is it just that game has already set a low bar and it's just something for you to enjoy in the meantime?
Myself and many others it seems are in the same boat with you there, pal! Minus Apex I wasn't a massive BR fan but this was a good addition! I personally am curious to see if it can hold its own and if it keeps being updated over time! I'm glad you're enjoying it though!
    I completely agree, the only BR games I've liked are; Nuclear Winter, Apex Legends, and Minecraft:Hunger Games. I'm excited for them to work on it more and release a full version. My only complaints are that matches are to short for the time to get in them, and I occasionally glitch so that no button does anything besides open the menu to quit.
        After cursing myself last night, I experienced my first game breaking glitch when reviving someone, the Power Armor I was in entered an animation and never finished it, it just locked up, I could back out of the game fully or just let the storm take me so I waited. It will be brilliant when it's polished up a bit!
            Yeah that's happened to me once. For me it mostly happens when I exit the map and try to open my pipboy to quick, it's like the game doesn't like it so it just locks up.
Awesome stuff! I'm glad you're enjoying it! Did you get to play much of the base game with all the new content or was this reason for you to boot the game up again?
    I only played the beta of the base game, and that was enough for me at t that point to not buy it at launch and after seeing every other issues that came with it after the fact im glad I didnt do it.  But now at this point and at this stage and with also the BR mode added I'm quite likely to buy it and play both the base game and Nuclear winter after the free week trial runs out.
        Wow that's brill! Glad to see you're back in Appalachia! - At least you'll join on a much cleaner and smoother experience! :)
It's perk card packs which appear to only be for this mode, I could be wrong though! There's also stuff for Adventure Mode like items for your camp, icons, etc! Do you think you'll get the game after this week or will you wait beyond the sales and for the addition of even more content?
    I am having a good time so far, but yeah I think I'll give it some time before I really sink my teeth into it. I'm enjoying where the game is headed and think the aspect of reclaiming the wastes is a good one. The idea of running around with buddies and hookin and jabbin across West Appalachia is something has always been what draws me in, so I'm sure in time I'll definitely be back on later down the line, as a humble trader.
        Well I hope to see you back in Appalachia, pal! - Good to see you'll give it another chance!
Yeah, it's definitely a shame but without being a standalone game, I think it's part and parcel of it coming packaged with Fallout 76. - Will you come back after the pre-beta has finished or maybe even play some of the Adventure Mode in the meantime?
I'm so glad you're having fun with it! Did you play much base game or did this bring you back?
    Oh yeah, I’ve been playing constantly since launch. I love fallout 76. For the last few months I’ve mainly been doing PVP in survival, there’s a huge advantage there if you have good gear. The beauty of NW is it equals the playing field, as well as gives advantage to teams that work together. I also love the decision making involved. Do I engage? Do I revive? Do I need to find better loot? It’s so fun, and how PVP was meant to be
        That's a nice breathe of fresh air, it's awesome you stuck through it all! Hopefully it's paid off for you! Thank you for the comparisons on the other modes too and how you've played it prior to this! - I hope you continue to enjoy Appalachia!
Of course, that's perfectly fair! Do you reckon you'll ever pick it up again and dive in and what would that take?
    I actually never played it, after the initial bad reception I decided to wait a while
I admittedly was part of that crowd and definitely regret it; especially seeing how well the mode turned out! - If you know roughly, can you guess how many hours you put in before it started getting stale and was it just the game that got boring or did the issues that came with it put you off too?
    I've put over 300 hours into the game, so I'm sure it's just that I've done basically all of the content. Of course it's the new events and items they release that keeps me coming back. I will say that the big reason I still play so much is because I'm always on with my best friend. We always wanted a fallout co-op game so 76 really scratches that itch.
        That's really nice to hear! It must be cool just sinking hours into it with a buddy! Thank you for getting back to me though, helps a lot!
            No problem! I will say that without my buddy playing, I probably wouldn't have put in 300 hours by now. Maybe more like 200. But I still enjoy playing solo too. It's just way easier to put in a ton of hours in a day when we play.
>I love the mode. My only issues with it are technical-- frame rates, environmental collisions (getting stuck on so much shit constantly!!!), stuff other BRs have sorted since they were built around the mode, that 76 will have to tweak to make smoother. I think its super fun though.

Don't tell people you use an *Xbox* controller for PC on the internet!!! Haha! Yeah, there is a few issues, especially getting stuck, I get that a lot. Even playing Adventure Mode today, I've realised it happens a lot less there for some reason.  (Maybe different areas, interiors, etc. but still!)
    Bwahahaha I know, I play all my other games with my keyboard and mouse but for some reason, Fallout just feels better on a controller. T_T lol.
That's definitely a new take on this whole thing! It's great that they've managed to pull you back though, especially now there's so much for you to enjoy if you do decide to go back to Adventure Mode at some point!
Unrelated but I did do a video on the stuff in the Tricentennial Edition which may help! With the sale though, it's worth it! - So glad you're enjoying it and coming from the free trial!
    Link?
        Here you go, Sir: https://youtu.be/OjL7omLk5a0
            Nice! Thanks
                No problem; thank you for checking it out! Hope it helps you!
lolwut

If you're gonna buy a shitty game like Fallout 76 don't settle for 50% off.

Amazon has it for $17, Walmart has it for $17.

Damn fools and their digital copies. One of these days people will learn.

Walmart has the Tricentennial edition for $20. All that edition does is give you some shitty cosmetic skins.

A $3 charge for those shitty skins is much more appropriate than the $20 ShitThesda tried to get at launch.
    Idc digital is the way to go. Why leave the house when I could just download the game? Been fully digital since 2017 over 40 games. #JumpIn the future of gaming. Just like music,  discs will be a thing of the past. Just look at game pass. Ok bye.
    Ah I'm sorry you're not overly impressed by the Tricentennial Edition content! I'd have to agree somewhat about digital copies, you can't beat having a case to display and a physical disc to take to a friend's house or whatever! I got the content as I preordered the PA Edition and it just happened to come with it! If you don't mind me asking, have you played the new mode or are you not returning until further additions are made?
I have mentioned this in a few other responses, the loads times and all the waiting make it feel like an afterthought not a fluid part of the game you can just drop into. - Did you own 76 before this or did you hop onto it with the Trial Week?
Did you not enjoy 76 and has this just added 'insult to injury' or did you remotely enjoy it from launch, etc?
    "Facebook and YouTube are my main source of news"

This is a sub for hating on anything that deviates from FO2.  Try over at /r/fo76, they're a bit more likely to have actually played the game.
        Thank you for the feedback, I had the the same response on r/fo76 regarding here however! Can't hurt to have both sides, although that will be a factor explored in the video it seems! - Have you yourself played it if you don't mind my asking?
            500 hours or so total in 76.  Probably 1000 in FO4, not sure about 3 and NV, but a fair amount.  I'm not a big fan of the NW part, because I suck at PvP, but I've been impressed with the little bit I have played (Just made rank 2 while you were waiting for my reply, so maybe 45 minutes)

Great stuff! Hardcore fan then? ;) It's cool that you're not massively into it but respect what they have done with it! :)
                    I didn't really get into the franchise until about a year after FO4 came out.  I watched a streamer playing it and was intrigued, picked it up later and just loved playing it.  Picked up older ones to play through just to experience them.  I even waited a month or so after 76 came out before I picked it up.

I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore fan.  People that have FO tattoos...yeah that's hardcore.  I'm most certainly a fan though.
                        That's great! A lot of people came in through Fallout 4! Weird of you to mention I do actually have a tattoo of Vault Boy on my forearm! Haha! I'll try and remember to include it in the video to show you! :')
                What system are you on? I know some pretty good loot routes if you're on ps4 and want to squad up.
                    PC, and my schedule is crap so I never know when I'll be playing anyway.  Thanks for the offer though!
                    Gotta love this community! Nice of you to offer! <3
        If you look in a thread like this that asks for opinions, you’ll see every other one upvoted but the moment someone gives a negative one then immediately they get all of their news from fake sources and get downvoted.

This thread is like the 76 sub. Downvote anything negative and pretend anyone who didn’t like it is in the wrong.
            If you go back even a couple months, you couldn't open your mouth about 76 here without getting down-voted unless you were shit talking it.  Right now it seems to be swinging the other way, but it seems relatively civil unless you just spew bile without decent reasoning.

The 76 sub is definitely a fan sub, but I'm not sure I'd expect otherwise.  And civil complaints are very well tolerated.

I'll be frank, the game isn't nearly that bad, though it's not totally great.  The new mode seems to be well liked though.  And I think it's a whole lot less deserving of the vitriol than it was at launch.

I'm replying to everyone and looking at every side of this! Do you care to share your experience with the new mode at all?
                Tbh, I’ll probably never play 76 again. If they release private servers and mods then maybe but as it stands now, it’s a very clunky game built on an engine that already felt clunky in 2004.
                    That's a fair enough comment, sucks that you don't feel like you can play it again! Hopefully once servers and mods are added you can jump back in!
                        Adding mods directly contradict their cheap and reused assets they sell in their shop. Mods ruin the whole ‘games as a service’ model they’ve set up.

There’s many great games to play and as someone with a career and a healthy life, I just can’t justify playing a mediocre game in this lifetime more than I already have.
    Ive never enjoyed it. Its a bugging mess. Spent my whole check on it and fell through the damn map 30 minutes into the game. Its a bs cash grab and always will be.

Maybe I’ll hop in if friends want to play but I expect that by that point I’ll be pretty bored of the mode and won’t have any incentive to keep going after that. I don’t know when I’ll reach that rank, but I’m going to keep playing until I do even if it’s after Wastelanders drops (or if I get extremely bored before then I’ll stop but I feel like I won’t because this is just such so much fun to play right now).


Good luck on your video!
    Right on, man! Keep grinding whilst you enjoy it and I'm sure it'll be a good time! Thank you, goull have to check it out when it's done! Should be this week!
Well I just know from my experience that 76 was great and surprised me, so I think it will surprise me and be great again
    Well put, be sure to give it a go and get back to me if/whenever you have time! Enjoy Appalachia!
        I will.
I played for like an hour. And no I haven’t played adventure mode.
I really do hope so! Is there anything after this and NPCs you'd want next?
    I want an eyebot companion that follows me around, even if it doesn't do anything and is purely cosmetic I'm still wantvit anyway
        I didn't know I wanted this until now! That would be awesome or like a dog or something to travel with you like ESO, that would be cool!
            like it wouldn't even have to do anything you could have different skins for the eyebot to make it into a balloon that follows you around or a miniature cargo bot, and you could do that with other animals that could just follow you around cosmetically like a squirrel friend or opossum friend or a beaver friend etc.
I have, yeah.  Despite not being able to fully enjoy the perk card system I still enjoy playing for all the rest that it offers.
I’m kind of in the middle, I actually am trying to push through some of the bugs in regular adventure mode but honestly i already explored the whole map back in beta and I find myself not caring enough to get back on and play. I think after wastelanders comes out I’ll give it one more shot!!!
    It's weird I actually just spent the majority of today cruising through Adventure Mode but a few moments did frustrate me but I swore to myself I'd have a break from NW! - Hopefully Wastelanders can retain your interest!
I completely agree, the only BR games I've liked are; Nuclear Winter, Apex Legends, and Minecraft:Hunger Games. I'm excited for them to work on it more and release a full version. My only complaints are that matches are to short for the time to get in them, and I occasionally glitch so that no button does anything besides open the menu to quit.
    After cursing myself last night, I experienced my first game breaking glitch when reviving someone, the Power Armor I was in entered an animation and never finished it, it just locked up, I could back out of the game fully or just let the storm take me so I waited. It will be brilliant when it's polished up a bit!
        Yeah that's happened to me once. For me it mostly happens when I exit the map and try to open my pipboy to quick, it's like the game doesn't like it so it just locks up.
I only played the beta of the base game, and that was enough for me at t that point to not buy it at launch and after seeing every other issues that came with it after the fact im glad I didnt do it.  But now at this point and at this stage and with also the BR mode added I'm quite likely to buy it and play both the base game and Nuclear winter after the free week trial runs out.
    Wow that's brill! Glad to see you're back in Appalachia! - At least you'll join on a much cleaner and smoother experience! :)
I am having a good time so far, but yeah I think I'll give it some time before I really sink my teeth into it. I'm enjoying where the game is headed and think the aspect of reclaiming the wastes is a good one. The idea of running around with buddies and hookin and jabbin across West Appalachia is something has always been what draws me in, so I'm sure in time I'll definitely be back on later down the line, as a humble trader.
    Well I hope to see you back in Appalachia, pal! - Good to see you'll give it another chance!
Oh yeah, I’ve been playing constantly since launch. I love fallout 76. For the last few months I’ve mainly been doing PVP in survival, there’s a huge advantage there if you have good gear. The beauty of NW is it equals the playing field, as well as gives advantage to teams that work together. I also love the decision making involved. Do I engage? Do I revive? Do I need to find better loot? It’s so fun, and how PVP was meant to be
    That's a nice breathe of fresh air, it's awesome you stuck through it all! Hopefully it's paid off for you! Thank you for the comparisons on the other modes too and how you've played it prior to this! - I hope you continue to enjoy Appalachia!
I actually never played it, after the initial bad reception I decided to wait a while
I've put over 300 hours into the game, so I'm sure it's just that I've done basically all of the content. Of course it's the new events and items they release that keeps me coming back. I will say that the big reason I still play so much is because I'm always on with my best friend. We always wanted a fallout co-op game so 76 really scratches that itch.
    That's really nice to hear! It must be cool just sinking hours into it with a buddy! Thank you for getting back to me though, helps a lot!
        No problem! I will say that without my buddy playing, I probably wouldn't have put in 300 hours by now. Maybe more like 200. But I still enjoy playing solo too. It's just way easier to put in a ton of hours in a day when we play.
Bwahahaha I know, I play all my other games with my keyboard and mouse but for some reason, Fallout just feels better on a controller. T_T lol.
Link?
    Here you go, Sir: https://youtu.be/OjL7omLk5a0
        Nice! Thanks
            No problem; thank you for checking it out! Hope it helps you!
Idc digital is the way to go. Why leave the house when I could just download the game? Been fully digital since 2017 over 40 games. #JumpIn the future of gaming. Just like music,  discs will be a thing of the past. Just look at game pass. Ok bye.
Ah I'm sorry you're not overly impressed by the Tricentennial Edition content! I'd have to agree somewhat about digital copies, you can't beat having a case to display and a physical disc to take to a friend's house or whatever! I got the content as I preordered the PA Edition and it just happened to come with it! If you don't mind me asking, have you played the new mode or are you not returning until further additions are made?
"Facebook and YouTube are my main source of news"

This is a sub for hating on anything that deviates from FO2.  Try over at /r/fo76, they're a bit more likely to have actually played the game.
    Thank you for the feedback, I had the the same response on r/fo76 regarding here however! Can't hurt to have both sides, although that will be a factor explored in the video it seems! - Have you yourself played it if you don't mind my asking?
        500 hours or so total in 76.  Probably 1000 in FO4, not sure about 3 and NV, but a fair amount.  I'm not a big fan of the NW part, because I suck at PvP, but I've been impressed with the little bit I have played (Just made rank 2 while you were waiting for my reply, so maybe 45 minutes)
            >500 hours or so total in 76.  Probably 1000 in FO4, not sure about 3 and NV, but a fair amount.

Great stuff! Hardcore fan then? ;) It's cool that you're not massively into it but respect what they have done with it! :)
                I didn't really get into the franchise until about a year after FO4 came out.  I watched a streamer playing it and was intrigued, picked it up later and just loved playing it.  Picked up older ones to play through just to experience them.  I even waited a month or so after 76 came out before I picked it up.

I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore fan.  People that have FO tattoos...yeah that's hardcore.  I'm most certainly a fan though.
                    That's great! A lot of people came in through Fallout 4! Weird of you to mention I do actually have a tattoo of Vault Boy on my forearm! Haha! I'll try and remember to include it in the video to show you! :')
            What system are you on? I know some pretty good loot routes if you're on ps4 and want to squad up.
                PC, and my schedule is crap so I never know when I'll be playing anyway.  Thanks for the offer though!
                Gotta love this community! Nice of you to offer! <3
    If you look in a thread like this that asks for opinions, you’ll see every other one upvoted but the moment someone gives a negative one then immediately they get all of their news from fake sources and get downvoted.

This thread is like the 76 sub. Downvote anything negative and pretend anyone who didn’t like it is in the wrong.
        If you go back even a couple months, you couldn't open your mouth about 76 here without getting down-voted unless you were shit talking it.  Right now it seems to be swinging the other way, but it seems relatively civil unless you just spew bile without decent reasoning.

The 76 sub is definitely a fan sub, but I'm not sure I'd expect otherwise.  And civil complaints are very well tolerated.

I'll be frank, the game isn't nearly that bad, though it's not totally great.  The new mode seems to be well liked though.  And I think it's a whole lot less deserving of the vitriol than it was at launch.
            Well put! I'm trying my best to take in as much as I can and see both sides, I like it and nothing will change that for the moment! I'll definitely be sure to include your take on this as a broader look though! Do you have any experience with the new mode, if so how have you found it?
        Of course, I understand there'll always be bias and protection over stuff people like. It's human nature sadly but it doesn't mean we can't have a good conversation about this! I'm replying to everyone and looking at every side of this! Do you care to share your experience with the new mode at all?
            Tbh, I’ll probably never play 76 again. If they release private servers and mods then maybe but as it stands now, it’s a very clunky game built on an engine that already felt clunky in 2004.
                That's a fair enough comment, sucks that you don't feel like you can play it again! Hopefully once servers and mods are added you can jump back in!
                    Adding mods directly contradict their cheap and reused assets they sell in their shop. Mods ruin the whole ‘games as a service’ model they’ve set up.

There’s many great games to play and as someone with a career and a healthy life, I just can’t justify playing a mediocre game in this lifetime more than I already have.
Ive never enjoyed it. Its a bugging mess. Spent my whole check on it and fell through the damn map 30 minutes into the game. Its a bs cash grab and always will be.
    I'm sorry it wasn't what you had hoped for! - I haven't been unfortunate as to experience any glitches as such, that's a real shame. Thank you for your feedback though!
        You are just about the nicest person on this subreddit. If i say anything that isnt praising 76, i get hailed with insults and a storm of down votes. Im just gonna leave this subreddit. Its literally being turned into r/fo76
            No, of course! People can be very defensive of something they enjoy! Sometimes too much so! All the best though!
    [deleted]
        At points I personally found all the new content a little overwhelming but that's only due to the sheer amount added! - It definitely got better from Jan-Feb onwards!
Haha, likewise! Just about to hit Level 10 after a 7 Kill - 2nd placement!
Ye idk I’m kinda of the type of player that just plays through the bugs, takes a lot for me to consider something broken....coming from anthem and division on Xbox and I have them the most lol
    God, yeah I get that! They had a very rocky launch! Glad you've put that aside though and gave it a blast!
        Haha free play days, it’s gonna have to earn my money lol nuclear winter could tho depending on how it goes
            Interesting take! Thank you for your input and hopefully I'll see you in Appalachia, my GT is the same as my username if you wanna have a game or two?
                Haha I’m west coast US so odds are you’ll be sleeping by the time I’m on, but I’ll send you a FR just in case the stars align lol
Yeah, I feel you! After dropping £175 on the PA Edition, I felt obliged too, although not too happy about it as more problems came up. Recently though, with the new content I've loved it! Are you holding out for NPCs or are you jumping back into it for some Nuclear Winter?
AM as in adventure mode? Probably not until Wastelanders comes out. I have done most of the stuff in the base game and I'd rather come back fresh after a year off with a shit tonne of new content to do. Wild Appalachia was cool but from what I read didn't have THAT much content.
    Yeah, my bad! AM as in Adventure Mode! That's fair enough though, I'm sure a lot of people will do what they did with NW and jump back into it when Wastelanders drops with the NPCs! Thank you for your feedback though!
No, I wholeheartedly understand that! Definitely isn't enough to stick around for if you aren't overly keen from the get go. I like AM and NW but much prefer NW and I solely started playing again for it! Hope to see you back in Appalachia soon though!
Yeah, it's not the cleanest experience but to be fair to them, like you say, it's a Fallout twist. - Something to at least spice up the game a bit!

    That's a fair enough comment, sucks that you don't feel like you can play it again! Hopefully once servers and mods are added you can jump back in!
        Adding mods directly contradict their cheap and reused assets they sell in their shop. Mods ruin the whole ‘games as a service’ model they’ve set up.

There’s many great games to play and as someone with a career and a healthy life, I just can’t justify playing a mediocre game in this lifetime more than I already have.
No, of course! People can be very defensive of something they enjoy! Sometimes too much so! All the best though!
Interesting take! Thank you for your input and hopefully I'll see you in Appalachia, my GT is the same as my username if you wanna have a game or two?
    Haha I’m west coast US so odds are you’ll be sleeping by the time I’m on, but I’ll send you a FR just in case the stars align lol
I didn't really get into the franchise until about a year after FO4 came out.  I watched a streamer playing it and was intrigued, picked it up later and just loved playing it.  Picked up older ones to play through just to experience them.  I even waited a month or so after 76 came out before I picked it up.

I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore fan.  People that have FO tattoos...yeah that's hardcore.  I'm most certainly a fan though.
    That's great! A lot of people came in through Fallout 4! Weird of you to mention I do actually have a tattoo of Vault Boy on my forearm! Haha! I'll try and remember to include it in the video to show you! :')
PC, and my schedule is crap so I never know when I'll be playing anyway.  Thanks for the offer though!
Gotta love this community! Nice of you to offer! <3
