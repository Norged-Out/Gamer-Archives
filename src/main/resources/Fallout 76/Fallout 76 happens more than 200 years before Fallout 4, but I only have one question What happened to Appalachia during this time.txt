[[Fallout 76 happens more than 200 years before Fallout 4, but I only have one question What happened to Appalachia during this time]]


I love the game and come back to it every major update. But while playing, I can't avoid thinking about where are our influence in USA. What happened to Vault 76 and 79? The gold we recovered?

I've seen a theory saying that Vault 76 nuked Appalachia into oblivion at some point during this 200 years, but what do you think?

What happened to the region in these 200 years?


Itâ€™s unknown. 

The prevailing theory is that the 76 dwellers nuked it into oblivion. If you look at the lore surrounding the now removed nuclear winter mode, Appalachia was being destroyed by a Pyroclastic Storm. The dwellers then needed to fight to become overseer of Vault 51.

While Vault 51 and most of the lore is in the base game (Adventure Mode), it isnâ€™t clear if the events of Nuclear Winter are canon.
    In addition, they were trying to become the overseer to earn the hellfire prototype suit, the only safe way out of the region.

They also registered unwittingly for the vault in the shelter claim center.
        Wow, I didnâ€™t know about that last part.

Love that kind of dark lore in the series.
        So its confirmed that X-01 (and thus Hellfire) were made post war right?

Speaking of,what is the Enclave up to during the events of Fallout 76?
Didn't play the game so idk.
            Raven Rock and the Oil Rig are consolidating power and preparing for the storylines of 3 and 2. The Enclave of Fallout 76 are at the Winterspring Bunker, which killed all members who weren't on board with continuing the war and then self-imploded because they became too cartoonishly evil. It's just a sentient computer now.
                Damn dude,I mean I knew the Enclave was a group of ruthless idealogues,but that just seems dumb : continue the war effort,with what? How about regrouping with what's left of the country lol.

And then they all just kinda died and a ZAX took over?

Man,that just sound like Bethesda writing tbh.
                    Ekhart was believed insane even by other enclave members. He is very much meant to be portrayed as illogical.
                    Ekhart was a hard liner. They lost communication with the Oil Rig / President, so he pulled rank. It turns out that Appalachia had active nuke silos, FEV and a communist robot factory. He had the resources and was fanatical enough. The ZAK computer called MODUS was the active computer of the Winterspring Bunker and sort of just watching everything happen and assisted. When the rank and file realized that Ekhart was too fucking crazy they mutinied. In the mutiny they destroyed part of MODUS' data bank and it went crazy and gassed everyone in the Bunker. So when you start the game it's Just MODUS left in Appalachia.

It's all told to you via audio logs and computer terminals.
                    Pretty much every government has plan to continue fighting if need be after nuclear Armageddon. This isnâ€™t bad writing it a reflection of reality.
                        Compared to their usual MO of "Oh boy here I go killing again" this is their most reasonable enclave story.  I kinda wish we could launch off map nukes at modus's discretion for extra rewards as a kind of enclave wants to continue the war.
            No, it isnâ€™t. X-01 is confirmed to be pre-war during both 4 (nuka world has the creation of quantum X-01 in 2076) and 76 (via whitespring bunker terminals). Hellfire isnâ€™t 100% certain to be pre-war, but a prototype was shipped to vault 51 in 2080 from an Enclave facility, so it was probably started pre-war at least.

Thereâ€™s too much for me to quickly answer on the Enclave, so Iâ€™m just going to direct you to the fallout wiki. Go to the congressional bunker page and work from there. Youâ€™ll also want to look at the Site J page, and to know the newly-revived responders are getting supplies given to them by some remnants of the Appalachian Enclave without their knowledge.
            X-01 is pre war, APA 1, 2, and 3 (hellfire) are post war.
    Nuclear winter took place in 2102. It''s currently 2103 in FO76.
    Yup you needed to become overseer in order to get the hellfire power armor to survive that storm
It gets blown to hell.

The river you see on the East coast of the map is flowing to DC, that river that's empty. Raven Rock is like 20KM away from Harpers ferry...so yeah I really don't see there being such a radical change over that short of a distance otherwise. 

Also explains why there's no mention of any lush land just over the hills there.
>What happened to Appalachia during this time?

Completely unknown. Unless Bethesda makes Fallout 76 non-canon, we'll probably see a reference in the next Fallout game.  


My assumption is that everyone nuked themselves and the region is desolate.
    Wait? It's canon?
        Yes, itâ€™s canon. Most Fallout games are.
            That's awful
                Why?  What part of the FO76 lore is bothering you?
                    The Brotherhood being on the East Coast in any capacity.
                        And yet, it fits and makes sense with the prior lore.

Maxson would have wanted to make connections across the country, but would have been willing to redact any incidents that suggested weakness among the Brotherhood.

As stories continue, new information is part of the progress.  There was a time when it was unthinkable that Darth Vader was Lukeâ€™s father.
                            Not really, it only fits because of the narrative that Bethesda is pushing surrounding the Brotherhood. They were a small organisation bent on hoarding tech and producing new tech. 

But Bethesda seems to want to make them bigger and stronger than they ever were. They can't just leave them as they were, imo the brotherhood have never been all that good in Bethesda games. 

Lyons Brotherhood makes sense, Maxson's (FO4) makes sense. But FO76? The organisation is too small, far too small. Barely the force they were. It's stupid and it's Bethesda feeling the need to shove the Brotherhood into everything instead of leaving them be.
                                The prior lore indicates the original Brotherhood was much different from the BoS in FO1-4.

Thereâ€™s no lore conflict. The only conflict is based upon dogged nostalgia.
                                    No, that's actually wrong. The Brotherhood in FO3 splintered off as part of Lyons expedition to the East. The reason the outcasts exist is because they stayed true to the Brotherhood's ideals. It took them over 150 years to expand that far due to their isolationism, conflicts with the Enclave and dwindling numbers. 

FO4's Brotherhood is closer to the original's ideals without the isolationism. 

To say that Maxson and the Elders, the founders of the original Brotherhood's core tennants would send out an expidition that early, with as little numbers as they had, is ludicrous. 

Also, I'm not old enough for it to be nostalgia.
                                The Brotherhood in Appalachia is literally five dudes who recruited like a dozen other dudes, got lost, and then (are implied to eventually) fucking die. That's it. People are acting like this is absolutely lore shattering when it's absolutely nothing of note at all.
                                >They were a small organisation bent on hoarding tech

No. They weren't. For some reason people like to act like they've played the original games.

The brotherhood's entire prime directive is to prevent another armageddon. Hoarding tech is the most common method, but they will happily destroy technological advancements (mariposa/oil rig).

They also openly and willingly traded technology with the hub in fallout 1 and became the ncr's research and development in fallout 2.
                                    That Fallout 2 point was actually mentioned in FO1 ending slides then retconned in FO2 to them becoming more isolationist (but not aggressive).
                        Its perfectly explained and makes total sense
                Apparently you can't dislike anything FO on this sub
                    You can dislike however you want. But assuming something isn't cannon because you don't like it is just willful ignorance
                        I never assumed it wasn't, I simply didn't know because I didn't care.

Also I'm done with this thread
                            This isnâ€™t an airport.

Thereâ€™s no need to announce your departure.
                                Then why did you come to say goodbye?
                                    Apparently you _werenâ€™t_ done with this threadâ€¦ ðŸ¤£

Edit: And, thereâ€™s the vulgarity.  Further proving my point.
                    Weâ€™re just disagreeing thereâ€™s probably lots of that donâ€™t like 76
        its canon until bethesda says so
What happened to the group of people who kept launching nukes at their own region? Who kept injecting themselves with "serums" they got from the Enclave? Who started walking around in the toxic waste of the Pitt for fun? Yeah they're fucked.
I firmly believe that Appalachia turned into a post-scarcity utopia built upon the radioactive bats, but every attempt to leave the region taxed the flux supply lines too much, and any expansion wave collapsed.
    Would make for a great future DLC or something, returning to 76's map but 200~ years later and it being an isolated utopia desparately trying to maintain and expand.
i like the idea that they sealed themselves off when outside raiders and stuff got worse.
I might be miss remembering something but wasn't there a terminal entry in fallout 3 at the Citadel or somewhere that said the area in question was a radioactive hell hole?
    There was mention of Vault 76 but it didn't mention anything about radioactivity. It did say that 76 was a control vault that was meant to open after 20 years, after which the inhabitants would be pushed back into the world to rebuild.
My personal head canon until its explained is some new threat swept into Appalachia, wiped out most people again, 76 dwellers fought it with nukes and the area is now uninhabitable
Provided science works like it should, there's a great [theory](https://youtu.be/SJzb5zfdX1o) that the folks in Vault 76 got out way too early, and everything is still radioactive and contaminated, dooming them to a slow and painful death
The RNG for food was too high and everyone died
I don't think they nuked themselves to oblivion necessarily, as in the story currently, the scorched are gone.  Honestly, I'm starting to believe it became an enclave center and sealed itself away. With the return of the responders being shadow funded by the enclave, I'm starting to believe it becomes the main enclave "utopia" and kills anyone who goes within their region. I think this might actually be where most of the enclave soldiers we see in FO3 grew up. I think patrols just kill anyone that comes to the region, so they don't report back. Also nuclear winter took place in 2102, I think in 76, it's now 2103, so it never happened.
Somebody noticed that the radiation storms in Fallout 4 are derived from winds blowing in from Appalachia.

So, the Appalachian region is still summoning raid bosses 210 years after the great war.
    Wait, I thought they were always blowing in from the Glowing Sea?
        Itâ€™s definitely from the glowing sea.
            If anything the radstorms in 76 are from the glowing sea,  not the other way around
It renuked itself to kill the scorched
Canonically, we have absolutely 0 idea, none, whatso ever, we'll likely get a reference in the next Fallout game.......in about 2032 but til that happens, we just have no idea  


The common theories are, they blew themselves to oblivion or the outside raiders and other Fallout factions crept in until they destroyed anything the Dwellers built assuming they didn't blow themselves up first  


A personal theory of my own is that even if they didn't nuke themselves, the fallout from surrounding ares would slowly eat away at the lush Appalachia lands, the water would become more and more irradiated as it flows from elsewhere, the weather would blow in (think the rad storms in Fo4) and just turn Appalachia into what the rest of the Fallout Worlds look like
    I thought the canon was the pyroclastic fire aka Nuclear Winter event, where the prize was the prototype Hellfire suite to allow the surviving Responder to become the overseer of Vault 51.
Well assuming itâ€™s not like the glowing sea with all the nukes that went off, Iâ€™d always assumed it formed its own government, I mean they have the people, they have water purification systems, agriculture plus lots of lumper and mills. And the gold that a government would need. Or maybe all the different towns and factions just became several city-states
Quick question does anyone recommend fo76?
    Depends on what you enjoy in a fallout game.

It has great lore, probably the best world space to date, great exploration, weapons and gear ain't too bad and it has plenty of builds to choose from. The base game quests aren't really standard fallout more like lore hunts in a way, but the ones in the free DLC are and are pretty fun.
    I highly recommend it.


If your on XBOX add me, I'm taking a break till good Friday but I'll be on then once more.
        I mean yeah I'm on Xbox but I don't have fallout 76
    I do, its just FO4 without an indepth story but a better world.
Not more than 200 years. It's 185 years before fallout 4. How none of the 76 fanbois mentioned this in the thread is beyond me. How you got to more than 200 years is baffling.
My theory is the Scorched Plague came back, stronger, the the point where the vaccine didn't work and killed everyone off.
    But would the plague then die out on its own? Otherwise it would spread
Either nuked itself to death or a simulation. Who would want Fallout 76 to be a sim? Sounds like a Modus move
presumably? nuked to high hell, everyone dies and it's left uninhabitable.
As long as Sunny and the pipe survive, that's all that matters.
I imagine others are right, and they've nuked themselves irresponsible and also partially out of necessity. Scorched still exists despite inoculations and nuclear bombs. We know there's a bubbling storyline with the Enclave essentially puppet mastering the Responders, so it'll be interesting to see how it plays out. Perhaps if Nuclear Winter is cannon, the only things in the hellhole of Appalachia are scorched and a new set of Management foe the Enclave in their bunker. Maybe that's how they somehow re-enter the storyline in the future.

I'd love to see the Responders somewhere helping some region thrive. Their nature to help though might have driven them out, or perhaps they go to the Pitt to do good, but by Fallout 3, they're a distant dead memory. It all depends on where the story goes. I imagine the Brotherhood would head out at some point either through a loss to the Enclave/Responders or if victorious perhaps seeing the writing on the wall and their inability to stop the misuse of nukes. Perhaps they all migrate in another region where hostilities exist or even the opposite where they're thriving but disconnected from the events for the last 200 years.
Appalachia survived the bombs intact, but oh no, the secret government not-uranium mine was making mutant bats that carried a disease, and projections say in a few years the disease will cover the earth if it's not stopped now. We need to do the right thing and launch the last remaining missiles to lose this paradise but stop the disease that will end all life on earth.  


Like in game the bomb then blows up a tiny circle that lasts for a few minutes then goes back to normal and you can keep playing anyway and new quests keep coming.  But metafiction wise I think you are really supposed to think of those events as the start, middle and end of the story.
There is nothing , people from fallout 76 had few years to rebuild until china knew and nuked america again
In addition, they were trying to become the overseer to earn the hellfire prototype suit, the only safe way out of the region.

They also registered unwittingly for the vault in the shelter claim center.

Thereâ€™s no lore conflict. The only conflict is based upon dogged nostalgia.
                            No, that's actually wrong. The Brotherhood in FO3 splintered off as part of Lyons expedition to the East. The reason the outcasts exist is because they stayed true to the Brotherhood's ideals. It took them over 150 years to expand that far due to their isolationism, conflicts with the Enclave and dwindling numbers. 

FO4's Brotherhood is closer to the original's ideals without the isolationism. 

To say that Maxson and the Elders, the founders of the original Brotherhood's core tennants would send out an expidition that early, with as little numbers as they had, is ludicrous. 

Also, I'm not old enough for it to be nostalgia.
                        The Brotherhood in Appalachia is literally five dudes who recruited like a dozen other dudes, got lost, and then (are implied to eventually) fucking die. That's it. People are acting like this is absolutely lore shattering when it's absolutely nothing of note at all.
                        >They were a small organisation bent on hoarding tech

No. They weren't. For some reason people like to act like they've played the original games.

The brotherhood's entire prime directive is to prevent another armageddon. Hoarding tech is the most common method, but they will happily destroy technological advancements (mariposa/oil rig).

They also openly and willingly traded technology with the hub in fallout 1 and became the ncr's research and development in fallout 2.
                            That Fallout 2 point was actually mentioned in FO1 ending slides then retconned in FO2 to them becoming more isolationist (but not aggressive).
                Its perfectly explained and makes total sense
        Apparently you can't dislike anything FO on this sub
            You can dislike however you want. But assuming something isn't cannon because you don't like it is just willful ignorance
                I never assumed it wasn't, I simply didn't know because I didn't care.

Also I'm done with this thread
                    This isnâ€™t an airport.

Thereâ€™s no need to announce your departure.
                        Then why did you come to say goodbye?
                            Apparently you _werenâ€™t_ done with this threadâ€¦ ðŸ¤£

Edit: And, thereâ€™s the vulgarity.  Further proving my point.
            Weâ€™re just disagreeing thereâ€™s probably lots of that donâ€™t like 76
its canon until bethesda says so
Itâ€™s definitely from the glowing sea.
    If anything the radstorms in 76 are from the glowing sea,  not the other way around
I mean yeah I'm on Xbox but I don't have fallout 76
Raven Rock and the Oil Rig are consolidating power and preparing for the storylines of 3 and 2. The Enclave of Fallout 76 are at the Winterspring Bunker, which killed all members who weren't on board with continuing the war and then self-imploded because they became too cartoonishly evil. It's just a sentient computer now.
    Damn dude,I mean I knew the Enclave was a group of ruthless idealogues,but that just seems dumb : continue the war effort,with what? How about regrouping with what's left of the country lol.

And then they all just kinda died and a ZAX took over?

Man,that just sound like Bethesda writing tbh.
        Ekhart was believed insane even by other enclave members. He is very much meant to be portrayed as illogical.
        Ekhart was a hard liner. They lost communication with the Oil Rig / President, so he pulled rank. It turns out that Appalachia had active nuke silos, FEV and a communist robot factory. He had the resources and was fanatical enough. The ZAK computer called MODUS was the active computer of the Winterspring Bunker and sort of just watching everything happen and assisted. When the rank and file realized that Ekhart was too fucking crazy they mutinied. In the mutiny they destroyed part of MODUS' data bank and it went crazy and gassed everyone in the Bunker. So when you start the game it's Just MODUS left in Appalachia.

It's all told to you via audio logs and computer terminals.
        Pretty much every government has plan to continue fighting if need be after nuclear Armageddon. This isnâ€™t bad writing it a reflection of reality.
            Compared to their usual MO of "Oh boy here I go killing again" this is their most reasonable enclave story.  I kinda wish we could launch off map nukes at modus's discretion for extra rewards as a kind of enclave wants to continue the war.
No, it isnâ€™t. X-01 is confirmed to be pre-war during both 4 (nuka world has the creation of quantum X-01 in 2076) and 76 (via whitespring bunker terminals). Hellfire isnâ€™t 100% certain to be pre-war, but a prototype was shipped to vault 51 in 2080 from an Enclave facility, so it was probably started pre-war at least.

Thereâ€™s too much for me to quickly answer on the Enclave, so Iâ€™m just going to direct you to the fallout wiki. Go to the congressional bunker page and work from there. Youâ€™ll also want to look at the Site J page, and to know the newly-revived responders are getting supplies given to them by some remnants of the Appalachian Enclave without their knowledge.
X-01 is pre war, APA 1, 2, and 3 (hellfire) are post war.
That's awful
    Why?  What part of the FO76 lore is bothering you?
        The Brotherhood being on the East Coast in any capacity.
            And yet, it fits and makes sense with the prior lore.

Maxson would have wanted to make connections across the country, but would have been willing to redact any incidents that suggested weakness among the Brotherhood.

As stories continue, new information is part of the progress.  There was a time when it was unthinkable that Darth Vader was Lukeâ€™s father.
                Not really, it only fits because of the narrative that Bethesda is pushing surrounding the Brotherhood. They were a small organisation bent on hoarding tech and producing new tech. 

But Bethesda seems to want to make them bigger and stronger than they ever were. They can't just leave them as they were, imo the brotherhood have never been all that good in Bethesda games. 

Lyons Brotherhood makes sense, Maxson's (FO4) makes sense. But FO76? The organisation is too small, far too small. Barely the force they were. It's stupid and it's Bethesda feeling the need to shove the Brotherhood into everything instead of leaving them be.
