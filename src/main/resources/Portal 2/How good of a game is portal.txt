[[How good of a game is portal]]


I think I‚Äôm going to be playing it soon, I ran across the song Still Alive, and I fell in love with it but it seems I would understand the song more and enjoy it better if I played the games. Without spoiling the games for me, what do you like about Portal?

Edit: Thank you for all the feedback about the game, I‚Äôm definitely going to be buying it once I get my next paycheck

And for anyone wondering why I didn‚Äôt play it sooner, I didn‚Äôt grow up in a house that had a system that could play games, but now that I‚Äôve moved out and have an actually career and Xbox I‚Äôll definitely play it


It is universally considered a masterpiece, and is one of the few games that actually fits that description
    portal 1 isn't a masterpiece tho
        Portal 1 is definitely a masterpiece. I can't think of a single part of that game that I'd change. 

Portal 2 of course iterated on a way I never thought possible and I think most consider it one of the best games of all time.
            I would more consider this a great success
                Surely you mean ‚ÄúHuge Success‚Äù
                    It‚Äôs hard to overstate my satisfaction.
                        Aperture Science
                            We do what we must, because we can
            there's some things i can definitely say i would've changed on portal 1
                Can u tell them? Myself i would have added more stuff to do with the missile turrets
                    well i mean the game isn't really interesting until the last few chambers and even then it's kinda boring. maybe because i already know the entire story of portal. but when i played it, i didn't understand the hype. maybe it's because i don't live in 2007
                        I mean, you aren‚Äôt necessarily wrong, but you are biased by comparing it with Portal 2, mostly because Portal 2 spoils you. If Portal 1 is a 10/10, Portal 2 is 12/10

To put it another way that (hopefully) makes sense, it‚Äôs like comparing Minecraft pre and post aquatic update. It‚Äôll night and day in terms of difference and it‚Äôs actually very difficult to play versions before the 1.13 Aquatic Update. The game was effectively universally upgraded and made significantly better. ***But***, that doesn‚Äôt mean that Minecraft before 1.13 was shit or even any less of a masterpiece, because it very much was.
                            but what am i supposed to do? be covered in nostalgia that i don't have? i played it in 2023 and so my opinions will be from 2023
                                He said you aren‚Äôt necessarily wrong. You can have your own opinions based on your own experience of the game, and if you think it isn‚Äôt as good then that‚Äôs ok. The guy above was explaining the hype behind it and why it was successful back in the 2000‚Äôs
                                    i think i would've enjoyed it more if there wasn't such a big hype around it. i heard only praises about F.E.A.R. but when i finally played it, i didn't enjoy it that much. my expectations were set too high from hearing the praises from fans
Portal has great puzzles that really make you feel smart once you've solved them, and it's full of humour along the way. Takes 2-3 hours to complete.

Portal 2 is everything good about Portal, except with more characters, an actual plot, 10x funnier, way more content, and is just the perfect sequel. Takes 7-8 hours to complete.
    2-3 hours assumes I‚Äôm not a total idiot that took well over an hour on one section
        yeah, really it depends how good you are at solving puzzles. took me 3 hours, took a friend 5 or 6.
            or how much sleep you got
        Same. A couple puzzles made me put down the controller and walk away because the frustration was too much. Came back the next day and breezed right through 'em.
        Yeah, I know the feeling.

But whether you're good or bad, expect *Portal 2* to take *much* longer than *Portal 1*.
    Portal 1 took me 6-7 hours and portal 2 took me 10-15 hours
    2-3 hours? It took me less than 10 minutes (yes haha funny speedrun joke I know)
    mastahpeece
Portal 1 and 2 are games that even to this day are still great games, they don't feel old at all and could even still compete with games released today!
Portal has a good atmosphere, great humor, an interesting AI, and fun puzzles.

Portal 2 takes everything great about Portal, turns it up to 11, adds new mechanics, and gives it an actual plot.

Both are two of the best games ever made.
Portal is thw best game in existence
    Half life is better as a game, but portal is the best puzzle game
    no half life is better üò§üò§ü¶Öü¶Öü¶Ö
        Half Life is higher quality for those who appreciate it, but Portal is a game everyone can enjoy IMO

                Half-Life: Full-life Consequences

John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.

John Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said "its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences" so he had to go.

John Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.

The contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said "its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys".

John Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.

"I cant give you my lisense officer" John Freeman said

"Why not?" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.

"Because you are headcrab zombie" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking "my brother is in trouble there" and went faster.

John Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw "Ravenholm" with someons writing under it saying "u shudnt come here" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.

John Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.

John Freeman said "Zombie goasts leave this place" and the zombie goasts said "but this is our house" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.

Then John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.

When John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said "John Freeman! Over here!" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.

Gordon Freeman said "its time to end this ones and for all!" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said "thanks i could help, bro" and Gordon Freeman said "you should come here earlier next time" and they laughed.

The laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled "LOOK OUT BRO!" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said "NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!" and John Freeman walked real fast out.

John Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.

"I'll get you back evil boss!" John Freeman yelled at the top of lungs.

to be continued..?
                    I actually read all your shitpost. Good job.
                        It's a pretty infamously bad fanfic in the Half-Life community. Got a Garry's Mod narration and everything.
                            I still read it. I didnt knew it xD
                                It's pretty funny, here's a YouTube version https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOHxyZaZlaOs&ved=2ahUKEwim6JTKtq79AhWaR_EDHb3ECwkQtwJ6BAgPEAI&usg=AOvVaw1lzHCsfFf2jLzX6rbFtGL4
                    I remember seeing the Garry's Mod video of that and its sequels. Fun times.
                        Yeah that video series was really funny. I was actually pretty sad when John sacrificed himself at the end
                WHAT THE FUCK üêü
Portal 1 doesn‚Äôt really have much in the way of a plot, and it‚Äôs quite short, but it‚Äôs got great puzzles and is a hell of a lot of fun.

Portal 2 is better in almost every conceivable way, it‚Äôs the perfect sequel and one of the best games ever made.
Portal 2 is the highest rated game on steam. The creator of Mario (believed to be one of the most talented videogame designers in history) praised Portal when it came out. These things don't happen often.
Portal 1 and 2 are amazing, sad you listened to the song first because I'm pretty sure you get some spoliers tho
As it was made in 2011, portal 2 that is (portal still alive 2009) it was definitely ahead of its time, well made, and unique imo. It‚Äôs not ALL puzzles but that‚Äôs the premise of the game, you‚Äôre a test subject forced to go through these tests by a higher power GLaDOS and she makes funny witty comments while you‚Äôre playing so you don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù alone. It exercises your brain so good it hurts and it‚Äôs a game that has an interesting, kinda dark backstory (I suggest you read the comics AFTER portal still alive). And if you‚Äôve played half life maybe you‚Äôll notice some Easter eggs here and there so I‚Äôve heard. It‚Äôs just an awesome game and I‚Äôve actually convinced my bf a few days to start playing it and he loves it, he almost broke his controller a few times but he LOVES IT. Portal still alive can easily be finished in a day in two hours or so maybe 3 (idk I finished it in 4) but portal 2 is much longer and better in general but you need to play the games in order ofc. It‚Äôs safe to say if you end up liking portal still alive, you‚Äôll LOVE portal 2.
I would say that Portal 1 is like a practice session for Portal 2. Both are fun to play. And the storyline is incredible in both. Amazing voice acting
While Portal 2 is objectively better in every way, portal 1 is still an amazing puzzle game with a unique sense of humor.

That's probably why it got a sequel in the first place.
Just a heads up: even though still alive joyous, the game is not. It's actually quite creepy. Not a horror game in any way but it has this creepy atmosphere.
    Not creepy, just dark humor.
Portal is my favorite game. It starts with a very cool, straightforward puzzle solver premise. But soon you begin to notice things are ‚Ä¶ not quite right. I won‚Äôt spoil it for you, but do listen and explore as you play.

Then play portal 2 which is the best sequel ever made (to me)
Portal is one of my inspirations to pursue game development. I've spent years absorbing game design principles through the game's developer comentary and the developers' talks on youtube. I don't know how it is for others, but the highest praise I can give to media in general is that "it inspires me"
the question isn't if you should play portal, it's how many times you should play it over again.
Funne robot lady
Portal is the most unique game series I‚Äôve ever played. It‚Äôs innovative, and fantastic, and you‚Äôll love it. Seriously. Don‚Äôt read to many spoilers, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Don‚Äôt look for the solutions of puzzles online either. Just go with it. You can do it!
Portal is a nice cup of hot chocolate. Portal 2 is a whole dang adventure
It's a 15 year old game that people are *still* making new levels for. That says it all.

Make a STEAM account, put both of them on your wishlist, and wait for the next sale.
I personally like how the games really bend the reality their set in with the portal gun. I just generally like games that have unconventional mechanics, and portal is certainly on the top. While other games in this "genre" exist, such as Superliminal and probably a lot of other games that I don't know, I literally got Portal 1 and 2 in a bundle for 2 euros. Compared that to other games (I think Superliminal is about 20) that's the biggest deal in the entirety of gaming.
Portal is great as an intro as it's a relatively short game, Portal 2 is the same but moooore and it's so good. Play them both immediately!
I like its unique humour, its weird and wonderful characters, its absurd amount of secrets and the beauty and puzzling nature of its gameplay. Once you realise the game is for you, you'll never back out.
Awesome puzzle fun with amazingly written, witty humor! Personally one of my favorite games. :P
Im 37 and recently started playing video games again via the Switch. Most games are very boring despite the high rating, except for Portal. I even replayed it from the beginning to the end. Will be doing a third run sometime soon.
Good. Portal 2 is amazing
It‚Äôs a brilliant game. I can‚Äôt think of a type of gamer it won‚Äôt appeal to.
best game i‚Äôve ever played in my entire life
I loved the first one because it just got better and better. The ending was absolutely amazing. Portal 2 changes some things but it expands each amazing thing in the original and makes it better. Pick it up now.
It's a great game and 2 is even better
imo, portal 2 is the best game of all time, so please play these games. You will not regret it (unless you do)
Epic
Mostly the feeling of being a glowing brain genius when completing a hard chamber.
The best. Portal 2 is an unforgettable experience. I still remember playing for the first time and feeling overwhelmed but then eventually figuring out the exit was so rewarding. I played it through multiple times on several platforms and still really enjoy it. Coop is amazing.
Portal is quite literally a masterpiece, although I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôre gonna get many varying reviews by asking a question like that to a community dedicated to fans of the game.
Portal 1 took me an hour and a half. Portal 2 took 8 hours
So you know how sometimes when you hype something up, it‚Äôs hard for that thing to live up to expectations even if it‚Äôs really good?

I‚Äôve never worried about hyping the Portal series up too much.
The portal games easily take the top spot for greatest puzzle games of all time. They frequently get top 10 in greatest *games* of all time. The second one is easily my number one game.
Yes
Quite
Is this even a question?
It's 2023 how have you not played it...
Just came to say I was looking through Steam games today for some options, recently smashed out Fary Cry 5, Far Cry 6, RDR2, CP 2077 (omg), and yet... I still look at Portal and play Still Alive and Want You Gone on Spotify.  What an incredible game.  I'm not sure if it was the combination of puzzles, humour which hit me just right, but all up what an incredible game.  God I wish there was more.  Maybe Black Mesa could help. That was a joke, haha, fat chance.  I need more Portal humour.  And cake.
What answer do you expect from a portal subreddit
Going to a portal subreddit and asking if portal is a good game is on the same level as going to Church and asking if you should read the bible.
    I asked how good of a game it was, not if it was good or not. Then I asked what people liked about the game. I‚Äôm in the one piece subreddit, doesn‚Äôt mean I think it‚Äôs the best anime in the world
Portal 1 is the greatest piece of media ever displayed on a computer monitor. 
Portal 2 is a game released in 2011.
    I seem to have angered the portal 2 fans. Lol
        Portal 2 is everything good about portal 1 multiplied by a hundred
            Not agreeing with the other person but Portal 1s movement is far tighter and less floaty than Portal 2s and the way props interact with the world in P1 is superior to P2 at least IMO. Also I felt P1s chambers were more open to unconventional solutions than P2s which was IMO more fun.

Those are minor things though, you're right about the vast majority of other things.
            Plot wise yes, it actually has one instead of not. But the humor is dumb and the atmosphere is completely different.
                Atmosphere is different yes, but not worse. And the humor is the best in any videogame.
                    Ah yes, i love being reminded I‚Äôm fat and adopted by a British man every 3 seconds. Truly game of the year writing.
                        Happens once‚Ä¶ In reference to another character doing it once‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre going to complain about a game overusing something make sure sure it‚Äôs actually done repeatedly‚Ä¶
mediocre
Now, I'm rather biased, being part of the Portal subreddit and all, but I've played through the first game (I prefer it over the sequel by a LOT) like 30 times. It's one of my favorites, if not my absolute favorite game of all time.
The portal series is very good. I find it to be one of my favorites among all games. Portal 1/2 both have amazingly implemented soundtracks. The music of a game can shape it a lot. Then the lore: I think it is made pretty nicely too. In portal 1 you get no introduction, you get into testing immediately, but everything becomes clearer later on (dont wanna put any spoilers, i would elaborate further tho). So in short: it is masterpiece and the overwhelmingly positive rating on steam is certainly deserved.
They are both super good games and are quite enjoyable, some people prefer the 1st over the second but then some people like myself prefer the 2nd due to being longer and having a larger story
Portal 2 took me 2 days. It was worth it
portal 1 isn't a masterpiece tho
    Portal 1 is definitely a masterpiece. I can't think of a single part of that game that I'd change. 

Portal 2 of course iterated on a way I never thought possible and I think most consider it one of the best games of all time.

            Half-Life: Full-life Consequences

John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.

John Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat.

                I actually read all your shitpost. Good job.
                    It's a pretty infamously bad fanfic in the Half-Life community. Got a Garry's Mod narration and everything.
                        I still read it. I didnt knew it xD
                            It's pretty funny, here's a YouTube version https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOHxyZaZlaOs&ved=2ahUKEwim6JTKtq79AhWaR_EDHb3ECwkQtwJ6BAgPEAI&usg=AOvVaw1lzHCsfFf2jLzX6rbFtGL4
                I remember seeing the Garry's Mod video of that and its sequels. Fun times.
                    Yeah that video series was really funny. I was actually pretty sad when John sacrificed himself at the end

        Not agreeing with the other person but Portal 1s movement is far tighter and less floaty than Portal 2s and the way props interact with the world in P1 is superior to P2 at least IMO. Also I felt P1s chambers were more open to unconventional solutions than P2s which was IMO more fun.

Those are minor things though, you're right about the vast majority of other things.

Portal 2 of course iterated on a way I never thought possible and I think most consider it one of the best games of all time.
    I would more consider this a great success
        Surely you mean ‚ÄúHuge Success‚Äù
            It‚Äôs hard to overstate my satisfaction.

                    We do what we must, because we can
    there's some things i can definitely say i would've changed on portal 1
        Can u tell them? Myself i would have added more stuff to do with the missile turrets
            well i mean the game isn't really interesting until the last few chambers and even then it's kinda boring. maybe because i already know the entire story of portal. but when i played it, i didn't understand the hype. maybe it's because i don't live in 2007
                I mean, you aren‚Äôt necessarily wrong, but you are biased by comparing it with Portal 2, mostly because Portal 2 spoils you. If Portal 1 is a 10/10, Portal 2 is 12/10

To put it another way that (hopefully) makes sense, it‚Äôs like comparing Minecraft pre and post aquatic update. It‚Äôll night and day in terms of difference and it‚Äôs actually very difficult to play versions before the 1.13 Aquatic Update. The game was effectively universally upgraded and made significantly better. ***But***, that doesn‚Äôt mean that Minecraft before 1.13 was shit or even any less of a masterpiece, because it very much was.
                    but what am i supposed to do? be covered in nostalgia that i don't have? i played it in 2023 and so my opinions will be from 2023
                        He said you aren‚Äôt necessarily wrong. You can have your own opinions based on your own experience of the game, and if you think it isn‚Äôt as good then that‚Äôs ok. The guy above was explaining the hype behind it and why it was successful back in the 2000‚Äôs
                            i think i would've enjoyed it more if there wasn't such a big hype around it. i heard only praises about F.E.A.R. but when i finally played it, i didn't enjoy it that much. my expectations were set too high from hearing the praises from fans
yeah, really it depends how good you are at solving puzzles. took me 3 hours, took a friend 5 or 6.
    or how much sleep you got
Same. A couple puzzles made me put down the controller and walk away because the frustration was too much. Came back the next day and breezed right through 'em.
Yeah, I know the feeling.

But whether you're good or bad, expect *Portal 2* to take *much* longer than *Portal 1*.
Half Life is higher quality for those who appreciate it, but Portal is a game everyone can enjoy IMO

        Half-Life: Full-life Consequences

John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.

John Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said "its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences" so he had to go.

John Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.

The contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said "its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys".

John Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.

"I cant give you my lisense officer" John Freeman said

"Why not?" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.

"Because you are headcrab zombie" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking "my brother is in trouble there" and went faster.

John Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw "Ravenholm" with someons writing under it saying "u shudnt come here" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.

John Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.

John Freeman said "Zombie goasts leave this place" and the zombie goasts said "but this is our house" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.

Then John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.

When John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said "John Freeman! Over here!" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.

Gordon Freeman said "its time to end this ones and for all!" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said "thanks i could help, bro" and Gordon Freeman said "you should come here earlier next time" and they laughed.

The laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled "LOOK OUT BRO!" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said "NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!" and John Freeman walked real fast out.

John Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.

"I'll get you back evil boss!" John Freeman yelled at the top of lungs.

            I actually read all your shitpost. Good job.
                It's a pretty infamously bad fanfic in the Half-Life community. Got a Garry's Mod narration and everything.
                    I still read it. I didnt knew it xD
                        It's pretty funny, here's a YouTube version https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOHxyZaZlaOs&ved=2ahUKEwim6JTKtq79AhWaR_EDHb3ECwkQtwJ6BAgPEAI&usg=AOvVaw1lzHCsfFf2jLzX6rbFtGL4
            I remember seeing the Garry's Mod video of that and its sequels. Fun times.
                Yeah that video series was really funny. I was actually pretty sad when John sacrificed himself at the end
        WHAT THE FUCK üêü
Portal 2 is everything good about portal 1 multiplied by a hundred
    Not agreeing with the other person but Portal 1s movement is far tighter and less floaty than Portal 2s and the way props interact with the world in P1 is superior to P2 at least IMO. Also I felt P1s chambers were more open to unconventional solutions than P2s which was IMO more fun.

Those are minor things though, you're right about the vast majority of other things.
    Plot wise yes, it actually has one instead of not. But the humor is dumb and the atmosphere is completely different.
        Atmosphere is different yes, but not worse. And the humor is the best in any videogame.
            Ah yes, i love being reminded I‚Äôm fat and adopted by a British man every 3 seconds. Truly game of the year writing.

He said you aren‚Äôt necessarily wrong. You can have your own opinions based on your own experience of the game, and if you think it isn‚Äôt as good then that‚Äôs ok. The guy above was explaining the hype behind it and why it was successful back in the 2000‚Äôs
    i think i would've enjoyed it more if there wasn't such a big hype around it. i heard only praises about F.E.A.R. but when i finally played it, i didn't enjoy it that much. my expectations were set too high from hearing the praises from fans
