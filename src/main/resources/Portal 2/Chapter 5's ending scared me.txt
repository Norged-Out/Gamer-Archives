[[Chapter 5's ending scared me]]





Actually... why do we have to leave right now?
    Me: "is this the part where he kills me?"
        Not yet
        That would be 'The Part Where He Kills You'.
            “AAH! Well.. this is the part where he kills us!” “Hii! This is the part where I kill you!”

The Part Where He Kills You
    8 year old me was SO shocked and hurt when that happened haha
        YES, and, at the end of the game, I heard everything Wheatley had to say about me, it was awful, having to constantly take him down while he told everything he hated about you, it just hurt...
            I KNOW!! I’m still hurt about that... I mean, even still, I really like him, but... it still feels bitter haha. I just wish he hadn’t turned on Chell like that.
                GLaDOS's corrupting ass body made him
        How would you have reacted if your first play through was now and not then back when you are 8 years old?
            I’m really sorry for the late reply!! I wasn’t on this account for a while. But I probably would’ve been also shocked and hurt, just a bit less lol.
    Do you have ANY idea how good this feels?
        I did this!  Tiny little Wheatley did this!
            You didn't do anything. She did all the work
                Oh really? That’s what the two do you think. Is it?
"Well, how about now? NOW WHO'S A MORON? Could a MORON PUNCH! YOU! INTO! THIS! PIT? Huh? Could a moron do THAT?"
"Uh oh."
    Wheatley: COULD A MORON PUNCH! YOU! INTO! THIS! PIT!? HUH!? could a moron do THAT!?
Me: y e s
    Yes punching is something that requires little intelligence
        # Y E S
        In fairness, throwing a good punch, especially under pressure, takes a little more wit than people give it credit for.
            What if you have a robot arm to do the punching for you?
        Even less
    “Yes, only a moron would do that”
    NOWAITWHEATLEYIMSTILLINHEREITSGOINGTOBREAKAAAAH
Me: * laughs because we beat Glados *

Wheatley: * laughs *

Me: * laughs *

Wheatley: **the laugh of satan**
    You: Starts laughing
Wheatley: laughs harder to beat the competition
With every CHELL of my body (please don't hate me)
    Dammit you made the joke before i could

Kudos
    r/angryupvote
I still love him. Dumb funny little British core
    If Gordon Freeman gets in smash and we get spirits from other Valve games, we need a Wheatley spirt
        I know it's been 3 years, but we should enhance it to be Wheatley on the Aperture mainframe
    I love how he plays basically the same character in The Good Place.
        wait i had no idea he was in the good place! that’s so cool
            Just the one episode, maybe two, but God love him, he's the same adorable idiot.
    I think you meant bri'ish
        Stephen Merchant has a Bristolian accent, so no.
            I dunno about accents
                Obviously.
                    not obviously, but how do you know which is which
                        That's a hell of a question. What country are you from? I assume you have various accents there. How do you tell them apart?
                            Yeah. But that's different because English is my second language.
                                Ah, fair enough!
First time I played (on early release day thanks to the ARG) I was kinda sad that the game was so short... Then I fell 4km into a salt mine!
I've replayed portal 2 so many times i cant remember my first playthrough
Portal 2 isn't worth the 10 bucks









Because its worth at least 30.
    I'm glad Valve released it at $10.
        Same. It makes it even more of a deal
    The second I realised my shitty laptop can run the Portal demo, I just bought the Portal+2 package and have no regrets.

    Really late reply, I know.

The flip side to this argument is that Wheatley seems to pin every single negative thing that has ever happened to him on other people. Right after confronting GLaDOS, he accuses the player of bossing him around, despite himself giving pretty much every single instruction so far.

Later on, when he accidentally(?) disables the funnel ride after seeing a giant wall of panel arms hurtling the player’s way, he chimes in that “you told me to turn off the funnel”, deflecting the blame from himself and putting it on Chell and GLaDOS.

He’s actually been willing to sacrifice the player for a long time, and considers handing them over to GLaDOS at the turret manufacturing line, before coming up with the genuinely helpful idea of swapping the turret model out.
On my first playthrough I thought it was part of his plan to escape and that he was just pretending to be evil. I was surely mistaken.
Wheatley being left in space forever broke me. Chell please go get him!!
    Then you’d better read Blue Sky! It’s an amazing fan fiction and I highly recommend it!
        \^\^\^ Absolutely this. Read Blue Sky, even if fanfics usually aren't your thing, it reads like a continuation of Portal 2 and Half Life, it's amazing and I wish it were canon.

    Wheatley did a jojo reference :o
“You’ the moron designed to make me an idiot” probably my favorite line in a game.
To be fair, apparently being in that body really messes up your mental processes. Or should I remind you of his his itch when we later meet up with him?
With every chell of my body
me on my 27th play through
It's how the devs wanted you to think :)

You don't trust GLaDOS but do wheatley for a plot twist
He’s tooooooooooooooooooooooooo cuuuuuuutttttttteeeeee
It hurt so much the first time I played, I loved (I still do) him so much and felt so hurt lol
Me on my fourth playthrough: with every cell in my body
He was a lovable dork with an adorable British accent. And when that happened, I was like “WHY THO?!”
 I finished Portal 2 yesterday. It’s a really good game, but honestly, I prefer just the charm of portal 1. Not much of a story, just like 19 tests, and a quick boss fight.
you really should trust me tbh despite what i have done
*DONT YOU DARE BİTCH*
Still would’ve taken him with me at the end
Holmes vs Moriarty...

Socrates vs SMASHY SPIKE PLATE!
Me: "oh this game was shorter than I thought"

Me a second later falling in a bottomless pit: "oh n o o o o o"
Chell: heh
Wheatley: Haha
Wheatley: Hahahaha
Wheatley: *HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA*
This is the part where he kills you
Well done meme
Yep

the funny thing is that i got notified about this post right after watching Crisis On Infinite Earths LMAO
It's not his fault. He's literally destined to do everything wrong.
The music for this part though
TAG SPOILER
    The game is almost 10 years old
        I know but some people haven't played it yet.
            By that logic we shouldn't say the "No, I am your father" line even though Star Wars is 40 years old
                That line is really iconic. Even people who have no interest in star wars know that line. But this is a meme that people who have played Portal 2 will only understand.
                    This is on the portal subreddit, most people here have played both portal games
                    Portal 2 sold over 6,000,000 copies
                        What harm would it do to flag as spoiler? The people who are interested in Portal but haven't played the second game will appreciate it.
    If you come to a game's subreddit, you probably have already played that game
I still trust him do
I actually couldn't believe people liked him. He annoyed the shit out of me from the first syllable he spoke.
Lol yeah
Wheatley wasn't evil, it was GLaDOS's body corrupting him. And GLaDOS herself became nice almost immediately after being disconnected and Wheatley regretted everything after. Doubt I'm the first one to think this
it was my first introduction to betrayal. oh how i wished i had listened
GLaDOS screaming in Ch.5 was genuinely harrowing on my first playthrough
I trust Wheatley. The problem is that he doesn’t trust me/Chell. GLaDOS says “You didn’t do anything, she did all the work” and he’s like “Oh really??? That’s what the TWO OF YOU think, is it???” 

Then you get to the boss battle, and he’s just going on about how you failed a trust exercise by not catching him when he said he could die, and you didn’t warn him about your history with GLaDOS, and how you used him to get to the portal gun and was planning to get rid of him all along once he’d outlived his usefulness to you and also that you and GLaDOS were secretly best friends conspiring against him the entire time and-

Yeah. Wheatley has some pretty serious trust issues. He turns against you because he’s the one who doesn’t trust you.
My heart broke when I couldn't trust him.
