[[Why is GLaDOS so massive in portal 2‚Äôs ost art]]





For dramatic effect
    omg it‚Äôs queen!!!!
Its a teaser for Portal 3 where you get shrunk i can confirm my uncle works for VALVe
    Don‚Äôt you mean VALV·¥±?
        No my uncle told me it‚Äôs spelt VALVe as well
        What is VALV to the power of E?
            Not Three
                What‚Äôs a three?
                    you mean tree?
    It‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm VALVe.
    True, my dad works at Scott cawthom
Symbolism ig
    This. GLaDOS is much more than we see and  Chell is tiny in comporison.
A metaphor, sure GLaDOS isn‚Äôt physically that big, but her presence is. Even as a potato
    This.
She's actually closer to the camera than Chell is
    GLaDOS controls all the cameras in there.


‚ÄúI ADJUSTED THE PERSPECTIVE TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT OUR ROLES. WE WOULDN‚ÄôT WANT ANYONE‚ÄôS IMPORTANCE TO BE MISREPRESENTED, AFTER ALL.‚Äù
    You know what, that actually kinda makes sense...
        Lol no it doesn‚Äôt, the light from her eye is shining down on Chell
            Oh yeah, lmao
                the light is in front of chell
            You know what, that actually makes a lot of sense.
            It's on the lens
I love this picture so much. Especially if you think the person is Cave Johnson
    It can't be.
because it looks cool?
    The only correct answer
chell is short
I really hope glados gets this big somday
    Not gonna lie, I think I do too after reading your comment
    GLaDOS builds herself a gigantic mech suit like something out of Pacific Rim, except instead of fighting monsters she just uses it to leave the Aperture facility and go visit Chell on the surface
    wat
Just imagine how much mixed feeling of uncanny, excited, yet terrified of the giant GlaDOS look infront of you the remains of Aperture has left. While on the headphone start to play Cara Mia Addio.
mercator projection
Actual Father Ted moment.

This cow is small. The others are just far away.
To make her more intimidating, also could be a forced production Glados being closer to the camera than the figure that I think is supposed to be Chell
poetic license
cause it looks cool
cuz it's hotter that way. i mean what
It looks badass
Cuz shes silly like that :3
She built a tiny Chell replica so she could feel even more superior
    Best reply ever
The bether question is "where are they/we?" Like there are a lot of realy long wires and piaces of stone stairs on the floor, where in Aperture Science there are THIS many non-iron stairs sets with SO MANY steps?
I think it's to represent how much more powerful GLaDOS is compared to the Chell or the player. She's like a God watching over us and shining her light on us meaning she's watching us.
That‚Äôs just a tiny person
This was a triumph
I've been wondering about this for over a decade now and it is so weird.
Idk, maybe she is closet t√¥ the camera or Valve just made this because yes
That‚Äôs not Chell. That‚Äôs a gnome-mate.
Perspective
Chell is just tiny
So she looks cooler than she already is
To make it look like she is in charge, or is meant to be in charge, of the facility

Having eyes on everything
because it‚Äôs cool and dramatic and serious and the artists are talented and cool and stuff and idk what else i‚Äôm stupid
It looks cool
Probably some metaphor
Maybe Chell is just rlly small
Because Caroline is in there too.
because it's not meant to be taken literally
Chell is 5'9
It looks cooler
To show her power
They used forced perspective when they took the photo. Like how they made the Hobbits look small in the Lord of the Rings.
She's in the skybox
One interpretation that I've heard is that everything in the picture is meant to be some kind of regret/mistake cave johnson made (him behing the guy in the middle), with the rubble being just a general gist of how he mannaged aperture. And glados (putting charoline in a computer) being his biggest mistake/regret. Hence, she is huge. Because she is his biggest mistake/regret.
For content purposes
because this is from Rattmanns' perspective

edite: a grammar
let me answer that question by answering a different question.  
"Whats the meaning of life"  
idk.
    42
Ost Art
Idk, big robot mommy tho
Seriously though, I think they said somewhere they wanted her to be this big, but it just wasn't plactical in gameplay.
Looks cool
because shes a big machine
its cool

Whoever that is is just realllllyyyyyyyy tiny ü§è
