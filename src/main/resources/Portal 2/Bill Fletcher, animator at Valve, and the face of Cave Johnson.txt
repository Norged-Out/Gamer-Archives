[[Bill Fletcher, animator at Valve, and the face of Cave Johnson]]





 No way, HE‚ÄôS ACTUALLY REAL!!!!!
    LOLLLLLL
    Cave Johnson was so successful they made him IRL
I played soccer with this man's son when I was 10
    What happened if you won? Was he going to burn your house down with some combustible lemons or would you just wake up in a test chamber?
        Thankfully, we played on the same team lol
            Cooperative testing initiative
                Now you‚Äôre playing with (foot)balls.

            Sending the link to a Google search for an image is somehow way funnier than the image itself
                3rd result is the furry porn game that steam won't stop recommending me, not sure how I feel about it
                    Changed isn't a furry porn game tho?
                        Sorry he meant *Furry fetish game
                    for me its the second result
            Funny enough, my dad knew his dad bc they both worked in video games. I was the kid with the dad who worked at Xbox, but like.. for real.
    Did he cheat using Portals?
    Go thunderbirds lol
    I was in a club with this same guy in college too, small world.
    Did he offer you lemons?
        Not to my memory. It's entirely possible that he did supply orange slices, though. All the parents took turns bringing snacks to practice.
            I bet he got those oranges from an Orange Box
    Weird flex
        Just a true statement
    Soccer, right ü´§
        Valve is in Seattle, that's what we call it here. Lol
    I would say you are lying but why the heck would you lie about that
What, you telling me it WASN'T JK Simmons himself as the model?
    The portrait kind of looks like a combination of both of their faces
        I'm pretty certain they used the animator for the young cave and jk simmons for the old, and just combined them for the middle aged portrait.

Source: I'm an artist and that's how I would do it.
            i'm an artist and i wouldn't do that (i don't know how)
        Anything could be possible I suppose.
    I honestly thought they used him as well. Maybe not for the younger Cave. Older Cave does look like him.
I saw him in a documentary about Valve and it was quite obvious that they used him for Cave Johnson. Also are we just gonna ignore Caroline besides him?
    No, I'm not supposed to fall for homocidal robots. Anyways, that's Laura Dubuk, a Valve artist. I was wondering why it looked like they were having lunch with Deadpool, turns out they're at Comic-con and there are more photos.

    It‚Äôs a mantis man.
        You‚Äôll know when the test starts.
    Looks like a Gremlin
        Looks like a maquette of Daffy from Gremlins 2.
            My money is on Lenny. We should have a kid and see what they think.
                Lenny's ears are droopy and longer, and his skin's a muddy brown.
            This guy Gremlins.
                I have probably seen the Gremlins about fifteen times and Gremlins 2 maybe five times.
                    But have you found out where did the gremlins go?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKX9fGvF63E
        Yeah pretty sure it's a Gremlin.
    Show some respect! That is Caroline and she's the BACKBONE of this facility!

Oh, lab boys wanted me to let you know: If you see any gremlins running around...do let us know, we had a couple break out of their testing tracks and now they're running around the facility screwing things up for the rest of us. Remember, see a gremlin, flag down a testing associate, because that little green bastard's not part of the test.
        I read this with his voice lmao
            Same here

Pretty sure everyone did
                This is true, read it in his voice too
        Oh Mister Johnson, you flatter me!
        Definitely something Cave Johnson would say lol
        I feel like someone needs to make a Cave Johnson bot like the ones in other game and movie subs. Missed opportunity.
    It's a Gremlin from the movie Gremlins.

Jesus am I that old that there's people on here now that don't know what Gremlins is?!
        Next year, that movie is 40 years old... realised that after watching it the other day
        For the amount of Redditers that watch RedLetterMedia, they should know what Gremlins are by now.
            That particular gremlin in the photo might actually be one of the few in Redlettermedia‚Äôs ‚Äúcare‚Äù
        Yes.

Whole adults.
        I know the movie but wouldn‚Äôt have recognised that as one of them.

Not stripe

    That's Spike, you can tell by the eyebrow ridge! Gremlins 2 iirc
    Her name is GLaD05. 

I was told she brought cake.
        I did.
            MOM?!?!
    Caroline
The video game industry is wild. Some project manager casually asks a random dude doing animation work if he wants his picture taken to be used in Valve‚Äôs upcoming puzzle game or whatever during a break at the water fountain and next thing he knows he‚Äôs the face of the video game equivalent of Doc Brown in one of the most critically acclaimed games in history.
    I'm pretty sure the face for Eli Vance was just some guy they encountered 

I'm not sure about that I might be thinking of the random folks they used for the rebels and civilians
        Eli Vance was actually a homeless guy, they met Kleiner in an elevator lol
        A more unnerving fact is that one of the corpse models in hl2 uses an image of an actual dead man‚Äôs burnt face.
            Oh I'm aware

In fact I have the base image saved on my phone if you want me to DM it to you
                Nah, please don‚Äôt.
                    Understandable
                Morbid curiosity is getting the best of me. I kinda want to see it
                    I'll send it to you

Be warned it's a literal corpse so yeah
                        Oh dear. Thanks
        Also both Valve intro screen guys were just random people pulled off the street
    When I worked for Sigil when they were making Vanguard (long dead MMO), it was random
People who were the VAs. The little mousey receptionist was the female gnome, that‚Äôs the one I remember
Funny how you didn't recognize Caroline face model beside him.

And don‚Äôt forget Caroline! She‚Äôs pretty as a postcard, too. Sorry fellas. She‚Äôs married: TO SCIENCE!
Alright, I've been thinking. When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade - make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons, what am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager. Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons. Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down! With the lemons. I'm going to to get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!
    Burning people! He's saying what we're all thinking!
No, there‚Äôs no way that woman is the face of Cave Johnson
Did he grow the vintage sideburns for the role, or is that just the look he always rocks?
....... WAT
HE'S REAL COMBUSTIBLE LEMONS ARE REAL
I think I‚Äôve seen this photo before, but I thought it was a cosplay.
Who‚Äôs Gremlin is that.
And she‚Äôs pretty as a post card, too
showed this to my friend and he said, i quote, "why do they both look like wax figures that would be used in stop motion animations"
this guy also looks like the sniper in team fortress.

Coincidence? I don't think so.
yes sir mister johons!
What's with the red hand with finger gloves across the table? Biker devil?

Love it all these years later.
Is that a gremlin behind him? Like from the movie gremlins?
THE JOHNSON IS REAL!!!!!
When life gives you lemons, you grow sideburns.
Therapist: Cave Johnson isn‚Äôt real he can‚Äôt hurt you 

Real Cave Johnson:
You can‚Äôt convince me that‚Äôs not Cave dimension-hopping again and trying to stay undercover.
He didn‚Äôt even animate his own face üò≠
Don‚Äôt let him blow your house up with lemons.

No one let that man get his hands on some lemons

Fake. There‚Äôs no WAY he would be drinking out of a Black Mesa mug.
 Who‚Äôs the lovely lady?
Cool! Also, why is there a gremlin puppet on a stand behind them?
Gremlin over there tripping balls
Aperture Science will be real
Have to wonder if Mike Stoklasa and Rich Evans are at that convention, too.  And if that Gremlin still smells like Toppling Goliath Pseudo-Sue?
Low key looks like merasmus

oh shit he's real

    Sending the link to a Google search for an image is somehow way funnier than the image itself
        3rd result is the furry porn game that steam won't stop recommending me, not sure how I feel about it
            Changed isn't a furry porn game tho?
                Sorry he meant *Furry fetish game
            for me its the second result
    Funny enough, my dad knew his dad bc they both worked in video games. I was the kid with the dad who worked at Xbox, but like.. for real.
Not to my memory. It's entirely possible that he did supply orange slices, though. All the parents took turns bringing snacks to practice.
    I bet he got those oranges from an Orange Box
Just a true statement
Valve is in Seattle, that's what we call it here. Lol
I'm pretty certain they used the animator for the young cave and jk simmons for the old, and just combined them for the middle aged portrait.

Source: I'm an artist and that's how I would do it.
    i'm an artist and i wouldn't do that (i don't know how)
Anything could be possible I suppose.
Oh my god the last one with the second cave ü§£ü§£
Too bad, she's married! 

**To science!**
Hissssss

Eeeeewwwwww ü§¢

Looks like a maquette of Daffy from Gremlins 2.
    My money is on Lenny. We should have a kid and see what they think.
        Lenny's ears are droopy and longer, and his skin's a muddy brown.
    This guy Gremlins.
        I have probably seen the Gremlins about fifteen times and Gremlins 2 maybe five times.
            But have you found out where did the gremlins go?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKX9fGvF63E
Yeah pretty sure it's a Gremlin.
I read this with his voice lmao
    Same here

Pretty sure everyone did
        This is true, read it in his voice too
Oh Mister Johnson, you flatter me!
Definitely something Cave Johnson would say lol
I feel like someone needs to make a Cave Johnson bot like the ones in other game and movie subs. Missed opportunity.
Next year, that movie is 40 years old... realised that after watching it the other day
For the amount of Redditers that watch RedLetterMedia, they should know what Gremlins are by now.
    That particular gremlin in the photo might actually be one of the few in Redlettermedia‚Äôs ‚Äúcare‚Äù
Yes.

Whole adults.
I know the movie but wouldn‚Äôt have recognised that as one of them.

The average age of reddit is early 20s.

Eli Vance was actually a homeless guy, they met Kleiner in an elevator lol
A more unnerving fact is that one of the corpse models in hl2 uses an image of an actual dead man‚Äôs burnt face.
    Oh I'm aware

In fact I have the base image saved on my phone if you want me to DM it to you
        Nah, please don‚Äôt.
            Understandable
        Morbid curiosity is getting the best of me. I kinda want to see it
            I'll send it to you

Be warned it's a literal corpse so yeah
                Oh dear. Thanks
