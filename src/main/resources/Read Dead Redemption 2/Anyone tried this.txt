[[Anyone tried this]]





I actually respect the developers for taking object modifications into cutscenes and that the action doesn't break the game.
    I stole a wagon one time that had a woman on it who never got off.  I assumed she would just be gone, or hop off before the wagon pulled into the barn. Nope. Rolled right in there with her and as the doors closed she was still sitting on it. Felt a little bad for that one. I hadn’t intended to be a human trafficker.
        You weren’t paid extra either I bet 

Shamus is cheap
            Ackshually, it’s spelt “Seamus”
                Semenus
                Fucking Irish (as in Hibernian)
        Dont feel bad. He will sell her for a good price. He sells other kinds of “wagons”
    well...it sure as shit breaks the interaction though lol

can't cover for everything in open world games
        It makes it funny. What more do you want?
            Mexico DLC
                Undead nightmare 2!
                    I haven't actually played games regularly in many years now, but I swear on my Granny, I would buy a brand new Xbox if Undead Nightmare 2 was released.
                Sepia filter?
                    waltuh
                I heard that's going to be released the same day as Half-Life 3
            Online content
                For GTAV? Sure!
                    Shark cards oo-haha
                60fps with duelsense support
            I don't want any more, I said devs can't cover for everything...they just can't

I didn't mean to come off as disappointed or demanding
            liars dice
        [I can't not post this](https://youtu.be/Brp5iwZoCoc)
            Actually laughed out loud at that, that's amazing
                The comedic timing is astonishingly good, it's too perfect!
            [Viva la Dirt League ](https://youtube.com/@VivaLaDirtLeague) needs to do a video based on this
            Oh my god incredible 😭
            This had me full on crying and snorting from how hard I was laughing, the comedic timing is impeccable 😂
            I would like to give my humble thanks to you for this humorous video. I laughed so hard some spittle was expelled
            I'd always get jump scared by these things even when intentionally hunting for them.
            He heard food and decided it wasn’t time to die
            Omg lol!
            I cried laughing at this, the final part with uncle had me dying.
            This is fucking hilarious! I laughed way too much at that
            Since I hated the everloving shit out of John, I took great pleasure in watching that. Thank you.
                What, why?
                    He was just a really shitty character. I never played RDR 1, so I had no nostalgic feelings towards him, which probably helps. Worst father\\husband\\gangmember ever. Constantly fucking up, constantly overestimating himself. Just a huge letdown after playing as Arthur.
                        I don't hate him but I do have pretty much the same thoughts on him being a disappointment after playing Arthur. Arthur does a lot of bad things but felt like he was capable where John was just... a fuck up. It also felt like there was just less depth to his character, which is probably in part due to spending less time with him. On the other hand I liked Arthur pretty quickly so there's got to be more to it than just time.

I wonder if it's also because I also haven't played RDR 1 so I didn't get attached to whatever he becomes in that game.
                        Yea, I wish they had the option where you could switch back to Arthur after completing the main quest.

I, also, never played RDR1, but that's kind of the thing... RDR2 is a prequel to RDR1. So the guy has to have room to grow through RDR1.
                            He’s a whiny lil bitch in rd1 too.
                        Fair.
            Eh it's a mod, but it's funny
        Seemed pretty realistic to me
            yea the fac that the dude just accepts a leaking oil tank on his property is especially realistic
                You've clearly never fenced stolen oil drums before
        are speedrunners using this? sounds like a wet dream for a glitcher.
        ^damnit
        Not being covered would be if neither character reacted.
        At least he still got paid tho right
    This has been a thing since Red Dead Revolver. I remember playing as Manny Quinn and setting people/myself on fire during cutscenes. Thought it was hilarious then, and still do now lol
    the fact that that works is insane. 

rockstar is incredible
        Its not hard to make it work, they actually don't have to code anything special, just manipulate coordinates of objects so they stand in right place, detach the camera from player and start animations. They don't despawn the cart and spawn a new one for the cutscene, it's the exact same one and that's why it kept its holes.
        [deleted]
            most cut scenes do work like that, because it's far easier
                [deleted]
                    I mean, the fact that you can shoot holes in an oil tank for the oil to drop out, that you can light the oil by shooting at it, that the fire follows the trail of the oil, and that the tank explodes when the oil reaches the fire, I can’t think of any other open world game with that level of interaction with the world
                        MGSV had a pretty advanced level of interaction with the world
                        Why did the gun shot ignite the oil?

Why did the oil explode?

Cartoon logic is prevalent here.
                            it's a game there supposed to be fun
                            You’re right, Oil needs to be atomized to ignite. I’m an hvac technician but I’m ok with the liberties the game took.
                        [deleted]
                            GTA 5 - interactive world?? HOW?? It's extremely un-interactive. In GTA 4 you could walk into fast foods and buy and eat food. Here everything other than pre-scripted shops is closed.
                    They’re still incredible.
                    It’s far easier to do pre rendered cutscenes than real time cutscenes, don’t speak with such confidence on things you’re ignorant about.
                        [deleted]
                        The sheer irony of this statement.
                        Oh fuck you you pretentious dick.
            Oh shut the fuck up lol
                Hah. I had the same reaction.
            [deleted]
    They don't really have a choice because the cutscene is not a video, it's actually still in the live game. The only reason we had video playback cutscenes was it was too hard to program/write all that junk into the live game. Also, the graphics were too crappy back then. But now, the graphics are so good that the cutscene can be done with live in-game footage.
        But normally in other games, the explosion would happen, but the main character and the guy talking would act like nothing is happening, until the cutscene ends, and then they suddenly cry out in pain from being on fire.
            Never change Bethesda. Never change.
    It sucks when your horse wanders into a campfire and self immolates before you can end the conversation. Actually, now that I think back on it that was actually pretty awesome. I love this game
    Yeah actually worked seamlessly with the cinematic
        It's all in-engine, there was no cinematic or cutscene. It may seem pedantic but it's relevant because that's the reason it works.
            It's a cinematic in-engine as opposed to a pre-rendered cinrmatic, or cutscene if you will since cinematics are often implied to be more .. cinematic
                There was no cut, so it definitely wasn't a cutscene. It was an animation, not a cinematic.
    Like the cougar in the house building scene! :)

        It just won’t leave him alone!
    There's a lot of Youtube vids showing these things in RDR2 and it's hilarious. Where they intentionally throw dynamite (or what have you) and everyone is burning up as they're talking during the cutscenes. 

There was one with Strauss and his face was melting. It was gruesome but funny to see him carry on the conversation like normal (and Rockstar's body deformation when they get burned is almost too real).
    I wish other sections had this kind kind of freedom lmao. Usually it just fails if you do it slightly wrong.
    Do we lose honor by doing this
I will now
    Came here to say this lol. Definitely gonna try!
        Where did he get that Oil tanker anyways? I don't recall a mission driving one and never seen it before this clip.
            Pouring Forth Oil is the mission but you can find them at Cornwall Kerosene And Tar and on the road in between there and Valentine
    Ya I wanna run away as the fire tries to catch me
Man this is gold, I love this! Thanks for sharing OP!

            Oil that is
    hell nah they still exist 😭
Well now that I've seen you do it, I don't have to try that particular thing, but this is useful knowledge for other shenanigans
    Just slowly roll her right into the center of town
        With your horse waiting to pick you up, then go ride back out to the starting point, light it then walk away in slow motion
            I was gonna play another game tomorrow, almost finishing it. But that can wait. Saint denis bought to have a canon event
    I now want to trot around town with a flame trail behind me

        “You’re telling me I’m a storybook character from a hundred years from now, living inside a fancy electric box? Mister, the craziest story I’ve ever heard!”
            Is that an actual quote from the game?
                No, just made it up with my best Arthur voice.
                    Nice work!
    "Okay, I'll catch ya later then."
    The timing for all of it was too good.
    It’s like this is such a minor inconvenience for him and a daily occurrence
    "Not again"
The fact you can do this is and the cutscene changes is crazy lol, Rockstar really the 🐐s*

            Yes
        Corrected 😂 I was high
    [deleted]
    It’s not that deep bro, it’s just a cutscene that plays in real time, it’s not like they went out of their way to make that a possibility it’s a happy accident
        A lot of other games, the characters would not react to the explosion even if it’s in real time, it would just occur in the background.
    It’s not really a cutscene though, it’s just a fixed camera with live gameplay
    Rockstar really the 🐐s anus
If AI ever tries to take over the world because of what it’s learned, it’ll be from how we’ve all treated that specific fence hahahahahhaa
    It’s his hairline and voice I think
        It's definitely the hair.. just shave it and grow a beard already dude lmao
How many times did you blow yourself up before making it in though? That’s the real question
    If you find the person who made this video, ask them I guess.
I like how NPCs remember your previous misdeeds. I had probably shot up that one farm outside of emerald ranch about 20 times. Now, every time I ride by there they start shooting at me immediately.
    If you change your horse, clothes and hair, you can reset that behaviour, but as soon as they catch you doing anything bad again they'll see through the disguise and be back to shooting you on sight.
        I’ve never had luck getting this method to work :(
        Ohhhhhh
Arthur just gets up and says "damnit" and walks away.....
The awkward walk away at the end is fantastic
Makes “got something for you” sound a lot more menacing when you know what’s coming.
    He still gets off all casually like even if he dies it’s still the funniest thing he’s ever done
The main thing is, Artie got his $50 from Seamus right before it blows! Good timing!
    $50?!

He gives me $40 for a carriage...

Oil must've been cheap as shit in those days for an entire tanker to only be worth a tenner.
        or seamus is a cheapskate and gonna make bank with that oil
Reminds me of a video where a player got off the horse just before a cutscene of the group riding a long distance. So Arthur just runs beside the others who are riding.

Edit [found it](https://youtu.be/rZyrAhX63l0?si=FJgtSgopdjEizg-1)
    That music tho
    I've done that in the mission. It doesn't outright fail, but you cannot progress without the horse, your horse is still have way to Colter, and you cannot whistle for it at that range.
    The same thing happened to me accidentally in the mission you capture Ramon Cortez with Sadie lmaoooo

Still blows my mind how old this game is. Also that they created this insanely in-depth world and did nothing else with it. No DLC? They could kept this game going for years, but instead wanted to focus on online and make it a half assed gta5 online. Could have just put all resources into single player content
    They didn’t really do much with online either. Rockstar resources goes mostly to managing GTA Online.
    I hate to say it, but sounds like the time of the Story DLC is dead. Don't look back.

Because game production is more expensive and takes longer, I see them "sorta" releasing DLC in the online mode, the way they continued Lamar and Franklin's story in the GTA Online DLC. That way, Rockstar somewhat satisfies fans wanting some story DLC but Rockstar sneakily makes money back with the microtransactions. Such is the way now.
        It’s just odd that they still could have made money off of content had they just put out more single player content
    Shit, even online would have been cool if they had some sort of regular co-op instead of the weird one-off mission things.
I’ve played this game for 1,183 hours, and I’ve never known you could do this. It’s incredible that I’m still learning new things about it.
Looks like money exchanged hands.  No refunds
    Seems like a clean wholesome transaction. I see nothing wrong here.
Absolutely brilliant
At least one person has
Real time cutscenes are superior
Now I'm gonna have to drive through Valentine.
I've never done that but sometimes I take the flammable moonshine draw bullseyes on the ground with it ride my horse up to a small adjacent cliff jump of and try to crash down in the middle. Kinda like horse darts for online. I also like to hogtie NPCs and use my horse rearing to stomp them to death. Good times man.
What did we saying about literally ghost riding the whip
"You're a good man, Arthur Morgan"
Did u really rip the youtube short and reuploaded it so you dont have to give credit or whats going on here?
🤣
Does he respawn?
    He’ll respawn but he’ll be all bandaged up from his injuries. It’s awesome
    Yes all fencekeepers respawn after they get killed. Same with storekeepers and bartenders
        And trappers. I saw a guy on YouTube accidentally shoot one and he respawned a couple days later still with a bloody chest lol.
    Yup I killed him 3 times yesterday, lol.
Lmao
😂😂
LOL!
"dammit"
    HAPPY CAKE DAY DAMMIT
And yet another “I didn’t even know you could do that” moment this game keeps delivering years after release
Gotta shake that shit off, playa. 🤣
This is the funniest shit I've seen all day.
man, the fact that you can do this in a game is mind boggling
You kill them horses
I always sell the oil wagons at the fence. The man gives really good money.
Yippykayo, Motherfucker!
    First thing that came to mind. Now I have urge to watch Die Hard 2.
Arthur: Damnit!
Lmao this is funny as fuck
And killed the horses?  This is worse than killing the dog.
You Sir are now my hero.

That was satisfying in every possible way.
Reason #5046 why live cutscenes are the best
“When this wagon hits 8.8 mph you’re going to see some serious shit!”
That took time to come up with and the cutscene that covered it, amazing. This fuggin game is THE BEST EVER.
“Dammit.”
[deleted]
    Actually pretty realistic. No air means no explosion.
Saint Dennis is about to suffer my next episode of Violence, Thank you OP.
When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit
Awesome. Just another statement of the details that Rockstar added to this amazing game.
I frickin love this game
This is so weird, I was just taking wagons to the fence like 20 minutes ago.
I’ve never had any luck finding the oil wagon but that is pretty cool and I imagine it pays the most of any of the wagons you can sell at the fence
    They’re quite common, they spawn in their natural habitat at the Cornwall Oil Fields.
        Ohh, well thank you for the info 🤠
Didn't know Seamus had unique dialogue if you bring him oil wagons

Great job burning horses alive, you sick people
I’m in love with you.
Hmmm Seamus would never buy those from me! That's pretty awesome!
Arthur: *sigh* dammit
Wow! This is so awesome! Poor horse lol
No but I bloody want to now
WHATTT I didnt know you could do this that’s so cool
The horses are OK, right?
Fucking devious lmao
Nice work, 47.

*A LITERAL EXPLOSION*

That was fucking amazing. Bravo 👏
I never find oil wagon in free roam, how i played over 400 h now

Nope. No one.

lol he paid you too
Anyone else notice his arm blow off and then suddenly reappear
But did you get paid?
Seamus dies? He can do that?!?!
Do you get wanted for car bombing people?
Got a good laugh out of this. Then I read some of the comments....and I thought I was harsh with my playing. Some of you take the cake 👀👀
Damn Arthur is a tank
Does the guy respawn though?
No, but I'm glad you did it haha
This game is the best ever made. The developers thought of almost every little thing possible to do
Uh.the.horses?
I did not know you can light the oil on fire
Thats was amazing
I love Rockstar

This is art
What a wonderful clip.
The best game ever developed
Lmfao
Poor horses
rockstar job description: attention to detail
Brilliant!!
No wonder gta 6 is taking time
This is absolutely crazy...
Looks like a blast!
Poor horsie :(
“Mission passed, respect +”
Lmao

It blows his arm off, but the cutscene respawns it onto his corpse with the old one lying next to him.
This was great 🤣
What about the horse someone probably
He'll be fine
I thought Arthur was going to reach 88mph on that sucker.
🤣🤣🤣
Did he respawn?
The fuck did the horses do to deserve that?
And just like that his plans for the afternoon changed.

 _Grabs keyboard_
Bah god!
*nervously looks back at fire trail*
This was funny as fuck. “ Got something for ya…”
How long does it leak oil for? Is it unlimited or does it have real contents?

Poor horse
Dammit.
Damm I miss this game. First thing I'm buying when I get a console back.
I can't stop laughing!
That was amazing! Reminds me of a time I escaped the law and I don’t think the game expected me to ride into the water with my crew. Next thing I knew the cutscene was all of us completely underwater talking about the next part of the plan, complete with air bubbles leaving Arthur’s mouth while he talked. Was laughing so hard
Nice repost
    Ditto
“Oil!” 

As he looks at it draining out the two bullet holes
Amazing.  Well done!
that’s AWESOME
How many attempts did it take before you pulled it off?
Well no but im not suprised it works
shoot the enter tank, nothing happens.

shoot the trail of oil, lights up on fire
Creative as hell!
Good to know the ol flame trail mechanic from gta carried over to rdr2
He handed the money over just in time ;)
Love how the guy just drops the payment into Arthur's hand and the tank just explodes, abruptly interrupting the cutscene. Wish more games did that.
Fuck yea
Wow I can't believe I haven't thought of this. I tried all kinds of stupid things with the oil wagons. My fav was backing up to the entrance of a saloon and throwing dynamite at it.
The cutscenese allow this kind of stupidity but you steer away during the actual mission and you fail.
Lol good thinking ive never even turned in an oil cart but this was entertaining
Good thing Seamus paid you first.
I love this game so much. Kinda got a little depressed after I finished it since there’s no other games out there that compare to it
Nope but nice didn't know you could do that
You can light the fucking OIl? I had no idea.
This is awesome. 

Wish I could get another oil cart.
Lol amazing!
God I love this game. If GTA6 is like this, it’s gonna be a game changer
bruh lol. “damnit!”
No because I don’t have the game because I’m poor
This is like a looney tunes cartoon. There was an episode called bunker hill bunny where they did this exact same thing.
I miss that game so much I need a new Xbox
God, I love the shit that gamers come up with
What’s extra cool is the oil only empty’s to the line. So if you were to shoot under those holes, more will come out.
I love this sub.
I really need to get back into this game
You sir are a genius
Bro I’m high asf, I though he said All in all 😂😂😂🚗
Where can you get that tanker or whatever it is called
These are fun too:

Wanna replay this game so bad
I can't remember the PS2 game that did something similar except you couldn't just shoot the trail you had to get the muzzle flash to strike the fuel. Unless you had incendiary ammo.
Nice game!
Dam'it.
This was amazing
JESUS CHRIST, I gasped outloud
Well, obviously. Or else there wouldn't have been a video of it.
Yeah the person on highlightreel a few days ago. Assuming thats where you got the idea from.
Exquisite
I felt bad for the horse. 🥲🥲🥲

It's great to be able to do that kind of things though.
😂🤣😂🤣
Professor Odd

Nurse Weird

Mr.Awkward MD
did he get payed
Wow. This game still amazes me!!!
They should keep developing the game and add more to it!
That’s awesome!
Wow I did not but you can actually sell them but whatever :/
Clever
When this game launched someone uploaded a vídeo of a family chasing arthur through the whole map.

I need it!
Lmao
You know how to makie friends
Don’t spend it all in one place
[Oh Arthur](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/s/kuXZHA2pft)
I tried this right after I found the third meteorite and lost it :( can’t go back and get it either.
That’s the evilest thing I can imagine
No I like horses
I bough this game on Friday. Wanted to play it for years after hearing it’s so good. I wasn’t prepared for how slow everything is. Just walking or doing anything feels like I’m moving through molasses. Sticking with it for a few hours, spending way too much time riding horse from place to place. The gun reticle is a small dot. The controls are a mess. Hold this and press this, hold this then release this. I accidentally shot my gun at a wood fence and got a bounty. All I’m doing is dirty work for Dutch. The game is a massive slow grind. Not sure I can hang. Maybe uninstall soon but hate to waste the money. It’s real nice visually but too dang slow and grindy. It feels like a western survival sim. I thought it was an rpg/3rd person shooter. Maybe a really overrated game, or just not for me. Maybe both. It really bugs me that you can’t bring some boys along by your choice for a mission. Also really bugs me you can’t manually save during a mission.
    You basically follow the story, complete mission and advance thru the chapters. This way you'll finish the game in no time.

BUT, the majority here (including myself), like the other stuffs. When you are not doing missions, you can roam around, explore places, hunt, do fishing, treasure hunting, train robbery etc.

Mission wise, it is not a big game, but everything else is very detailed, you can spend months doing stuff. 

To me, this game is one of the best games (if not THE best) ever created.

Just take a look at this video above. I've played this game for over a year & I didn't know that I could do it! That's insane.
you’re a good man arthur morgan
This was epic. Omfg funny
“Dammit”
Oh shit I didn’t watch it all the way thru!! Good rockstart is awesome even tho they suck ass for making invisible snipers and forcing you to do shit

I’ll be back
that was awesome
Ollie ahkbar
Ain’t no way this game this detailed. I need to finish
I did try to do this. Seamus would not buy the cart, he wouldn’t open the doors. There was a pop up explaining why, but I don’t remember what it said.
😂😂😂🤣🤣
When this baby gets up to 8mph, you're gonna see some serious shit
Well done, 47
Came here to say this lol. Definitely gonna try!
Cutscene skips be like
Hell, I'm impressed.
Lmao
I had no idea that it worked like that and it’s so cool that it does.
The new Oregon trail looks wild
It's been established that horses can't get up to 88 miles an hour. You need a steam train with some boosted fuel. That should fix your explosion problems.
No but I'm going to now
Reminds me of Golden Eye where you can throw a grande out of a window just before a mission ends and then in the cutscene it explodes.
Thought OP was doing some weird version of Snake. Was not disappointed.
Still learning new things about this game… wow
Rdr2 never fails to amaze me
Not yet
how much does the fence pay you for oil?
😂😂😂
didn';t even get paid.
Back to the future style
bros a trailblazer
The amount of details in this game....such a gem
Lmao great work
Do it on the first Reverend Swanson mission. You can chase the oil guy for a long time.
“Damnit.”
That's hilarious 😂
This is why real time cutscenes are the best
"Ugh, damn it."  LMAO
This game never ceases to amaze me
Those poor horses
Amazing
How is this not the greatest game of all time.
    It is
😂 that’s ace, did u still get paid
Prepare to have your video reuploaded to YouTube titled "This is why real time cutscenes are superior"
Lol
Hahahahaha amazing
Always a buyer for oi- aaaaaaaaaah
Bro got the top post in the entire subreddit in just 3 days. Congrats!
That is funny as hell, 🤣
this game is fucking amazing haha.
I love Arthur’s look of like “what the fuck” as if he had no clue how that happened
That chicken at the end
Y’all doing that while I’m still on chapter 1 story mode 💀
I have had sex 202 times and only 2 were women
The “damnit” as he gets up makes it. Laughed way too hard at that.
Fuc&$:g awesome
Does Seamus survive? Because I don't think this is part of the story.
I've got a plan! Imma do this but instead take it back to camp and put the wagon next to Micah 😌
No, because that’s my go to fence and him dying is bad for business
Wow
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
"Got something here for you."
You sir. Are the smartest person alive.
If you ain't ever done this, you ain't a real RDR2 fan.
That was really cool
This is the greatest game
I once threw a dynamite just before starting a mission where hosea and Seamus are sitting together. Seamus was killed and hosea still did the mission with injuries
Most detailed and immersive video game of all time. Adding an amazing story only helped solidify it as my favorite. They outdid themselves with this one. Fingers crossed for gta 6
I was going to post this clip earlier then the algorithm threw it on my feed, 25 days late. Almost like it was telling me “nope, that’s a repost, dumbass”.

Anyways, got somethin’ here for ya.
That’s great 😂🤣 poor guy just wanted to buy a stolen wagon 😂🤣
Epic
That is absolutely twisted af. I love it. Fuck that two-bit, cheap hick, anyway
Yes I have
bro i gotta try that wtf 🤣🤣🤣
So going to try his
This game is amazing
That’s unbelievable. How awesome is that!!!  Love it
Next time I see an oil wagon I'm blowing it up cause it just killed my horse
No, I will inevitably die haha. That's some real outlaw shit🍻😂
no bro that’s just you
“Oil, good-“ Not so good now is it?
Does he respawn
Did you get the cash for it? Or did explosion cut it off
That was funny
Hilarious
But did he get paid?
Never thought to kill shamus I needed his loot 😂
‘Do I still get paid?’
Where can you find one?
“Dammit.”
This is why R* games are SO FUN. I love doing things like this in missions trying to kill NPC’s that aren’t supposed to die. You can do something 6 years later that nobody else has ever thought of.
Imagine you go slightly faster with no oil in it. That's peak game detail right there.
Nope, but I am now🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ur so mad boy
I never tried it before!
You stole this video and got 40k views you are a Disgrace
🤣🤣🤣
Lmao! Poor Seamus
Ok now someone do this and ride into a clan meeting. Ok, I’ll try..

The details are insane
what a nice detail tbh lol
The the attention to detail is absolutely amazing in this game!
I stole a wagon one time that had a woman on it who never got off.  I assumed she would just be gone, or hop off before the wagon pulled into the barn. Nope. Rolled right in there with her and as the doors closed she was still sitting on it. Felt a little bad for that one. I hadn’t intended to be a human trafficker.
    You weren’t paid extra either I bet 

Shamus is cheap
        Ackshually, it’s spelt “Seamus”
            Semenus
            Fucking Irish (as in Hibernian)
    Dont feel bad. He will sell her for a good price. He sells other kinds of “wagons”
well...it sure as shit breaks the interaction though lol

can't cover for everything in open world games
    It makes it funny. What more do you want?
        Mexico DLC
            Undead nightmare 2!
                I haven't actually played games regularly in many years now, but I swear on my Granny, I would buy a brand new Xbox if Undead Nightmare 2 was released.
            Sepia filter?
                waltuh
            I heard that's going to be released the same day as Half-Life 3
        Online content
            For GTAV? Sure!
                Shark cards oo-haha
            60fps with duelsense support
        I don't want any more, I said devs can't cover for everything...they just can't

I didn't mean to come off as disappointed or demanding
        liars dice
    [I can't not post this](https://youtu.be/Brp5iwZoCoc)
        Actually laughed out loud at that, that's amazing
            The comedic timing is astonishingly good, it's too perfect!
        [Viva la Dirt League ](https://youtube.com/@VivaLaDirtLeague) needs to do a video based on this
        Oh my god incredible 😭
        This had me full on crying and snorting from how hard I was laughing, the comedic timing is impeccable 😂
        I would like to give my humble thanks to you for this humorous video. I laughed so hard some spittle was expelled
        I'd always get jump scared by these things even when intentionally hunting for them.
        He heard food and decided it wasn’t time to die
        Omg lol!
        I cried laughing at this, the final part with uncle had me dying.
        This is fucking hilarious! I laughed way too much at that
        Since I hated the everloving shit out of John, I took great pleasure in watching that. Thank you.
            What, why?
                He was just a really shitty character. I never played RDR 1, so I had no nostalgic feelings towards him, which probably helps. Worst father\\husband\\gangmember ever. Constantly fucking up, constantly overestimating himself. Just a huge letdown after playing as Arthur.
                    I don't hate him but I do have pretty much the same thoughts on him being a disappointment after playing Arthur. Arthur does a lot of bad things but felt like he was capable where John was just... a fuck up. It also felt like there was just less depth to his character, which is probably in part due to spending less time with him. On the other hand I liked Arthur pretty quickly so there's got to be more to it than just time.

I wonder if it's also because I also haven't played RDR 1 so I didn't get attached to whatever he becomes in that game.
                    Yea, I wish they had the option where you could switch back to Arthur after completing the main quest.

I, also, never played RDR1, but that's kind of the thing... RDR2 is a prequel to RDR1. So the guy has to have room to grow through RDR1.
                        He’s a whiny lil bitch in rd1 too.
                    Fair.
        Eh it's a mod, but it's funny
    Seemed pretty realistic to me
        yea the fac that the dude just accepts a leaking oil tank on his property is especially realistic
            You've clearly never fenced stolen oil drums before
    are speedrunners using this? sounds like a wet dream for a glitcher.
    ^damnit
    Not being covered would be if neither character reacted.
    At least he still got paid tho right
This has been a thing since Red Dead Revolver. I remember playing as Manny Quinn and setting people/myself on fire during cutscenes. Thought it was hilarious then, and still do now lol
the fact that that works is insane. 

rockstar is incredible
    Its not hard to make it work, they actually don't have to code anything special, just manipulate coordinates of objects so they stand in right place, detach the camera from player and start animations. They don't despawn the cart and spawn a new one for the cutscene, it's the exact same one and that's why it kept its holes.
    [deleted]
        most cut scenes do work like that, because it's far easier
            [deleted]
                I mean, the fact that you can shoot holes in an oil tank for the oil to drop out, that you can light the oil by shooting at it, that the fire follows the trail of the oil, and that the tank explodes when the oil reaches the fire, I can’t think of any other open world game with that level of interaction with the world
                    MGSV had a pretty advanced level of interaction with the world
                    Why did the gun shot ignite the oil?

Why did the oil explode?

Cartoon logic is prevalent here.
                        it's a game there supposed to be fun
                        You’re right, Oil needs to be atomized to ignite. I’m an hvac technician but I’m ok with the liberties the game took.
                    [deleted]
                        GTA 5 - interactive world?? HOW?? It's extremely un-interactive. In GTA 4 you could walk into fast foods and buy and eat food. Here everything other than pre-scripted shops is closed.
                They’re still incredible.
                It’s far easier to do pre rendered cutscenes than real time cutscenes, don’t speak with such confidence on things you’re ignorant about.
                    [deleted]
                    The sheer irony of this statement.
                    Oh fuck you you pretentious dick.
        Oh shut the fuck up lol
            Hah. I had the same reaction.
        [deleted]
They don't really have a choice because the cutscene is not a video, it's actually still in the live game. The only reason we had video playback cutscenes was it was too hard to program/write all that junk into the live game. Also, the graphics were too crappy back then. But now, the graphics are so good that the cutscene can be done with live in-game footage.
    But normally in other games, the explosion would happen, but the main character and the guy talking would act like nothing is happening, until the cutscene ends, and then they suddenly cry out in pain from being on fire.
        Never change Bethesda. Never change.
It sucks when your horse wanders into a campfire and self immolates before you can end the conversation. Actually, now that I think back on it that was actually pretty awesome. I love this game
Yeah actually worked seamlessly with the cinematic
    It's all in-engine, there was no cinematic or cutscene. It may seem pedantic but it's relevant because that's the reason it works.
        It's a cinematic in-engine as opposed to a pre-rendered cinrmatic, or cutscene if you will since cinematics are often implied to be more .. cinematic
            There was no cut, so it definitely wasn't a cutscene. It was an animation, not a cinematic.
Like the cougar in the house building scene! :)
    

https://youtu.be/Brp5iwZoCoc?si=n_2hzNyVEeUq8lzF
    It just won’t leave him alone!
There's a lot of Youtube vids showing these things in RDR2 and it's hilarious. Where they intentionally throw dynamite (or what have you) and everyone is burning up as they're talking during the cutscenes. 

There was one with Strauss and his face was melting. It was gruesome but funny to see him carry on the conversation like normal (and Rockstar's body deformation when they get burned is almost too real).
I wish other sections had this kind kind of freedom lmao. Usually it just fails if you do it slightly wrong.
Do we lose honor by doing this
Came here to say this lol. Definitely gonna try!
    Where did he get that Oil tanker anyways? I don't recall a mission driving one and never seen it before this clip.
        Pouring Forth Oil is the mission but you can find them at Cornwall Kerosene And Tar and on the road in between there and Valentine

Just slowly roll her right into the center of town
    With your horse waiting to pick you up, then go ride back out to the starting point, light it then walk away in slow motion

    “You’re telling me I’m a storybook character from a hundred years from now, living inside a fancy electric box? Mister, the craziest story I’ve ever heard!”

            No, just made it up with my best Arthur voice.
                Nice work!

[deleted]
It’s not that deep bro, it’s just a cutscene that plays in real time, it’s not like they went out of their way to make that a possibility it’s a happy accident
    A lot of other games, the characters would not react to the explosion even if it’s in real time, it would just occur in the background.
It’s not really a cutscene though, it’s just a fixed camera with live gameplay
Rockstar really the 🐐s anus
It’s his hairline and voice I think
    It's definitely the hair.. just shave it and grow a beard already dude lmao
If you find the person who made this video, ask them I guess.
If you change your horse, clothes and hair, you can reset that behaviour, but as soon as they catch you doing anything bad again they'll see through the disguise and be back to shooting you on sight.
    I’ve never had luck getting this method to work :(
    Ohhhhhh
He still gets off all casually like even if he dies it’s still the funniest thing he’s ever done
$50?!

He gives me $40 for a carriage...

Oil must've been cheap as shit in those days for an entire tanker to only be worth a tenner.
    or seamus is a cheapskate and gonna make bank with that oil
That music tho
I've done that in the mission. It doesn't outright fail, but you cannot progress without the horse, your horse is still have way to Colter, and you cannot whistle for it at that range.
The same thing happened to me accidentally in the mission you capture Ramon Cortez with Sadie lmaoooo
I was JUST thinking what would be the best place to do this and you nailed it on the head. Thanks for the idea!

They didn’t really do much with online either. Rockstar resources goes mostly to managing GTA Online.
I hate to say it, but sounds like the time of the Story DLC is dead. Don't look back.

Because game production is more expensive and takes longer, I see them "sorta" releasing DLC in the online mode, the way they continued Lamar and Franklin's story in the GTA Online DLC. That way, Rockstar somewhat satisfies fans wanting some story DLC but Rockstar sneakily makes money back with the microtransactions. Such is the way now.
    It’s just odd that they still could have made money off of content had they just put out more single player content
Shit, even online would have been cool if they had some sort of regular co-op instead of the weird one-off mission things.
Seems like a clean wholesome transaction. I see nothing wrong here.
He’ll respawn but he’ll be all bandaged up from his injuries. It’s awesome
Yes all fencekeepers respawn after they get killed. Same with storekeepers and bartenders
    And trappers. I saw a guy on YouTube accidentally shoot one and he respawned a couple days later still with a bloody chest lol.
Yup I killed him 3 times yesterday, lol.
HAPPY CAKE DAY DAMMIT
First thing that came to mind. Now I have urge to watch Die Hard 2.
Actually pretty realistic. No air means no explosion.
They’re quite common, they spawn in their natural habitat at the Cornwall Oil Fields.
    Ohh, well thank you for the info 🤠

Ditto
You basically follow the story, complete mission and advance thru the chapters. This way you'll finish the game in no time.

BUT, the majority here (including myself), like the other stuffs. When you are not doing missions, you can roam around, explore places, hunt, do fishing, treasure hunting, train robbery etc.

Mission wise, it is not a big game, but everything else is very detailed, you can spend months doing stuff. 

To me, this game is one of the best games (if not THE best) ever created.

Just take a look at this video above. I've played this game for over a year & I didn't know that I could do it! That's insane.

    Actually laughed out loud at that, that's amazing
        The comedic timing is astonishingly good, it's too perfect!
    [Viva la Dirt League ](https://youtube.com/@VivaLaDirtLeague) needs to do a video based on this
    Oh my god incredible 😭
    This had me full on crying and snorting from how hard I was laughing, the comedic timing is impeccable 😂
    I would like to give my humble thanks to you for this humorous video. I laughed so hard some spittle was expelled
    I'd always get jump scared by these things even when intentionally hunting for them.
    He heard food and decided it wasn’t time to die
    Omg lol!
    I cried laughing at this, the final part with uncle had me dying.
    This is fucking hilarious! I laughed way too much at that
    Since I hated the everloving shit out of John, I took great pleasure in watching that. Thank you.
        What, why?
            He was just a really shitty character. I never played RDR 1, so I had no nostalgic feelings towards him, which probably helps. Worst father\\husband\\gangmember ever. Constantly fucking up, constantly overestimating himself. Just a huge letdown after playing as Arthur.
                I don't hate him but I do have pretty much the same thoughts on him being a disappointment after playing Arthur. Arthur does a lot of bad things but felt like he was capable where John was just... a fuck up. It also felt like there was just less depth to his character, which is probably in part due to spending less time with him. On the other hand I liked Arthur pretty quickly so there's got to be more to it than just time.

I wonder if it's also because I also haven't played RDR 1 so I didn't get attached to whatever he becomes in that game.
                Yea, I wish they had the option where you could switch back to Arthur after completing the main quest.

I, also, never played RDR1, but that's kind of the thing... RDR2 is a prequel to RDR1. So the guy has to have room to grow through RDR1.
                    He’s a whiny lil bitch in rd1 too.
                Fair.
    Eh it's a mod, but it's funny
Seemed pretty realistic to me
    yea the fac that the dude just accepts a leaking oil tank on his property is especially realistic
        You've clearly never fenced stolen oil drums before
are speedrunners using this? sounds like a wet dream for a glitcher.
^damnit
Not being covered would be if neither character reacted.
At least he still got paid tho right
Its not hard to make it work, they actually don't have to code anything special, just manipulate coordinates of objects so they stand in right place, detach the camera from player and start animations. They don't despawn the cart and spawn a new one for the cutscene, it's the exact same one and that's why it kept its holes.
[deleted]
    most cut scenes do work like that, because it's far easier
        [deleted]
            I mean, the fact that you can shoot holes in an oil tank for the oil to drop out, that you can light the oil by shooting at it, that the fire follows the trail of the oil, and that the tank explodes when the oil reaches the fire, I can’t think of any other open world game with that level of interaction with the world
                MGSV had a pretty advanced level of interaction with the world
                Why did the gun shot ignite the oil?

Why did the oil explode?

Cartoon logic is prevalent here.
                    it's a game there supposed to be fun
                    You’re right, Oil needs to be atomized to ignite. I’m an hvac technician but I’m ok with the liberties the game took.
                [deleted]
                    GTA 5 - interactive world?? HOW?? It's extremely un-interactive. In GTA 4 you could walk into fast foods and buy and eat food. Here everything other than pre-scripted shops is closed.
            They’re still incredible.
            It’s far easier to do pre rendered cutscenes than real time cutscenes, don’t speak with such confidence on things you’re ignorant about.
                [deleted]
                The sheer irony of this statement.
                Oh fuck you you pretentious dick.
    Oh shut the fuck up lol
        Hah. I had the same reaction.
    [deleted]
But normally in other games, the explosion would happen, but the main character and the guy talking would act like nothing is happening, until the cutscene ends, and then they suddenly cry out in pain from being on fire.
    Never change Bethesda. Never change.
It's all in-engine, there was no cinematic or cutscene. It may seem pedantic but it's relevant because that's the reason it works.
    It's a cinematic in-engine as opposed to a pre-rendered cinrmatic, or cutscene if you will since cinematics are often implied to be more .. cinematic
        There was no cut, so it definitely wasn't a cutscene. It was an animation, not a cinematic.
It just won’t leave him alone!
Where did he get that Oil tanker anyways? I don't recall a mission driving one and never seen it before this clip.
    Pouring Forth Oil is the mission but you can find them at Cornwall Kerosene And Tar and on the road in between there and Valentine

    Next thing you know, ol' Jed's a millionaire

Be a Beverly Hill-Bill-Leeee^e^^e
    Oil that is
With your horse waiting to pick you up, then go ride back out to the starting point, light it then walk away in slow motion
    I was gonna play another game tomorrow, almost finishing it. But that can wait. Saint denis bought to have a canon event
“You’re telling me I’m a storybook character from a hundred years from now, living inside a fancy electric box? Mister, the craziest story I’ve ever heard!”
    Is that an actual quote from the game?
        No, just made it up with my best Arthur voice.
            Nice work!
It’s pajamas?
    It's bananas!
        It's coming down the stairs!
It's a minor spelling mistake does it matter that much?
    He’s just making joke’s
        He’s making joke’s what?
            It's a minor spelling mistake, does it....

Wait... Shit.
                woosh's
                    Woosh's what?
    Yes
Corrected 😂 I was high
A lot of other games, the characters would not react to the explosion even if it’s in real time, it would just occur in the background.
It's definitely the hair.. just shave it and grow a beard already dude lmao
I’ve never had luck getting this method to work :(
Ohhhhhh
or seamus is a cheapskate and gonna make bank with that oil
