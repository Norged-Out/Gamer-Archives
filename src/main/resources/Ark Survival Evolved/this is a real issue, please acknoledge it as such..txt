[[this is a real issue, please acknoledge it as such.]]


i just recently stopped playing ark survival evolved. over ~~25000~~ (edit: more like 18k-20k) hours, and im 17. i have spent more time playing that game, i fucking hated it. but i had so much invested.  
this is a real issue with younger people, im glad ark was there for me through some shit in my life, but i could have done so many productive things in my life with those hours...

please, if you have over 10k hours in a game, and you find yourself waking up JUST to get on, and sacrificing things for it, pay the money for a therapist, it helped me so much. pick up a hobby.

this is not a joke and its a real issue with the younger population, realize the issue, and fix it. or your not going to have a life.

edit1:i didnt think about it, id have to do the math but AFK time has some play in it, i used to leave my game on to avoid people watching the decay timer. maybe +/- some hours for that.

math is assuming 8 hours for a year is about 3000 hours. so realistically probably about 18-20k hours of non afk time?

(edit: NON AFK time)


hey man i‚Äôm sorry this has caused you so much stress. I just want you to know that when you‚Äôre 17, you‚Äôre not supposed to ‚Äúhave a life‚Äù

You‚Äôre supposed to be a boring teen who doesn‚Äôt have any idea what the fuck the rest of their life will look like. Ironically, any time you spent worried about wasting time doing things you like, e.g. playing Ark, is a waste of your time when you should be just be fooling around and being young. I promise to you dude. You‚Äôre okay. Honestly your hours are pretty impressive and yea I would say maybe find a new game to hyperfocus on lol but don‚Äôt feel bad. Clearly you have a great passion for the dino game. That is real. That isn‚Äôt something you need to be therapized for. Enjoy having the ability to spend so much time doing nothing man. Someday life might just start and then suddenly you‚Äôll be wishing you hadn‚Äôt worried so much about getting there and were still able to just play Dino game all day and night‚Ä¶
    I would half agree with you mainly due to the hours put In. I definitely had my fair share of gaming hours and yes I regret playing so much because I could have been spending time learning that I love let's say cars and making a life around that. This situation is different judging from the part where he said "tough times" but he obviously is regretting playing sooo much and it makes sense. He also has relized that there is so much more to life than games. That's what matters is making that realization stepping back from that one thing but keeping in mind it's okay to play games.
        yea i totally agree that‚Äôs why i said the hours are impressive if anything. Stop doing that, probably don‚Äôt play dino game cus maybe you‚Äôll slip back into that, but don‚Äôt be ashamed just move on. Who the fuck cares? At least we have the privilege to ‚Äúwaste our time‚Äù we could be child slaves in the industrial boom.
            Yes no shame just move on I agree.
    His life already started. He may find out later that he actually enjoys spending time outside a computer and he has responsibilities and little free time left. Or even worse...gaming is highly addictive and he might never find out what other things life has to offer due to this.

Gaming is fun but it's another activity and shouldn't be the sole source of entertainment or "passion" in anyone's life, much less a kid. He is still in development btw. For the record, I also judge binging on series or movies or endless scrolling as sole hobbies.
        ya i‚Äôm not saying to go back to being a hardcore gamer pal‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm saying that spending a couple years being a gamer playing dino game isn‚Äôt shameful. it isn‚Äôt your place to judge people for how they spend their time. not everybody has to be great and do great or worthwhile things. it‚Äôs cool, inherently, to go on adventures, but it‚Äôs not our business if someone would rather raise digital dinos. peace!
            I would agree with all that you were saying if the gaming hours he listed weren't so extreme and he wasn't a *kid* that is still growing. So many hours before the screen and being hyperstimulated do mess up with your neural connections, especially at that age. If it's a summer or two being cooped up building bases or raising high-level Gigas, it's harmless, but that's not what it sounds like in OP's situation.

Here, have your "peace" back. I'm not a "bro" nor in a Seth Rogen comedy üëã
                this\^  
im not talking about having something to escape, and thats what it was for me for say the first thousand hours, but after that it became a dependancy, and THATS where its bad.
                    I'm happy that you are actively trying to break free from that dependency, looking to do things and trying to enjoy your time also offline ‚ú®Ô∏è You're 17 and really young and I'm sure you have lots of cool stuff and experiences ahead of you! Whatever you live, try to live with awareness and purpose.

Good luck  ‚ú®Ô∏è üçÄ
                        you‚Äôre such a weirdo dude bro. chill out my guy you need to take it easy and deflate your huge airhead this isn‚Äôt r/lifeadvice your attitude is wack as hell i‚Äôm not gonna pretend i‚Äôm not being extra but you‚Äôre gross you meed to chill fr
                    i‚Äôm glad you got help but i want to clarify dude i‚Äôm not saying what you were doing was okay. I‚Äôm saying the alternatives for someone your age aren‚Äôt gonna be amazing or necessarily worthwhile. So fucking what you played too much video games! You don‚Äôt have to warn others. It‚Äôs a part of living and learning. You‚Äôre past that, so just do better. Jesus christ you reddit crowd are so dramatic‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt that serious lmao thos guy *actually* pulled a Zoolander on me
‚Äú‚Ä¶and i‚Äôm not your bro.‚Äù
                suck my dick bro you don‚Äôt get to decide whether or not you are a ‚Äúbro‚Äù you don‚Äôt have to be a douche

                        you‚Äôre really funny guy? you know jokes?

    Society doesnt really allow for that though. making freinds and aquantences and egtting involved in extra curreiculars teams/groups gives you an incredible advantage in gettings jobs and general life support.
        that‚Äôs not necessarily true i don‚Äôt think the richest people on the planet spent their time playing sports or chumming it up i think they sat and worked and worked and worked. There are different paths. You can work to the top, you can settle somewhere in the middle, or you can live small. No wrong answers. We‚Äôve already reached the final frontier. We are discovering the power of quantum computing and AI is evolving every day. Let the kid play dino game.
            Richest people in world are the Arnault family who are the biggest construction company in the world. Bernard the current fmaily head got his start with a small loan of $15 mil and just bought a bunch of already successful cosmetic companies. He is litterally the out of touch manchild stereotype you sin in movies and shows.

Elon 2nd richest has a history of "co founding" successful companies where hes basically the "ideas guy" and his partner does all the work. Hes now a full time twitter troll, with a wake of failed bussiness and relationships behind him.

Bezos at spot 3 started out with a small loan fo $300k from the bank of mum and dad and once again immediately hired other people to do the work for him. Now hes head of the most explotative company in the world.

We do not live in a meritocracy we live in a captalist plutarchy.
    This is sketchy advice. He basically played around 6 hours per day on average if he literally never skipped a day, ever. OP is very mature for acknowledging how it took over his life.
    10,000+ hours in a game that will eventually get deleted instead of spending some of that time developing their character, skills and relationships is not ok. Stop trying to make each other feel better about a genuine addiction. This will harm a young adults future.
I hear you. Separating from my soon-to-be-ex husband due to many reasons, one being in an online gaming addiction as a coping mechanism for the stuff that is wrong in his life. I used to LOVE Ark, I got into it during the pandemic. Husband started to play it so we could do something together.

ASA came out and we were moving to a new place. Once there, STBXH would spend 12-22 hours DAILY online on ASA. In the meantime, we were living a in a dusty place cramped with boxes. But he continued playing because "its your favorite game and I just want us to be setup for the boss fights quicker!" No dude, I want you to help me unpack, clean and for you to get a job and take your meds and go to therapy.

It ruined Ark for me.
    Damn üòÇ dude is a no-life man-child
        He was not like that when we met, but he went through a rough patch caused by health problems and then it all went downhill. Unfortunately, there are people who don't know how to cope with pain in a healthy manner and resort to addictive habits to numb it all out.

It's really sad watching someone you love push you and any help offered away, whilst they are just digging themselves into a deeper hole. But it's up to him to get a grip on his life now.
In my 40s I realized this about Destiny.  I did LOVE the game, but realized I had a compulsion to get on daily so I could get my faults, weeklys, etc.  I was playing just to stay with the meta.  I played times u really wasn't having fun for fear of not raiding that week or missing out on a drop.  So I quit it entirely one day.
    Same, played destiny from 17-26 years old and then realized how much time I was wasting just bc fomo and really didn‚Äôt enjoy the game that much anymore and quit cold turkey, havnt looked back since.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love ark but that‚Äôs the exact reason why I can‚Äôt play it anymore it either has to be your life or you have to not care and just mess around playing it casually do succeed you have to no life it and it makes you feel guilty for playing other games or doing other things it‚Äôs an amazing game and I truly miss it but I just can‚Äôt do it anymore
I would say it's okay for your hobbies to be games and for you to play them a lot if that's what makes you happy just make a little time for yourself and others as well. A written schedule for the day actually helped me understand how productive I actually was despite all my game playing, I would always feel down that I wasn't productive enough. 

My one tidbit is to not let anyone/ something else/ social media change how you feel about doing those things and make you feel down/ affect how you feel about your hobbies because it's also a very REAL serious issue. ü•∞ I have at least 3k hours in mhw, 3k hours in animal crossing and a couple hundred in a lot of other games as a little proof that I am also gamer. ü¶ç
This happens. I played WoW for years, and it did take over for a bit, but like all addictions, you have to just ...will yourself to stop. I have had my fair share of playing late, getting up early, etc with Ark. I realized it, uninstalled it, and havn't gone back. It wasn't easy, but like WoW, I have more important things to do, and I am not a child anymore.
Did you play every waking hour when you weren't at school?  25000 is almost 3 years of straight gaming.
    Right the math don't math up
    i didnt think about it, id have to do the math but AFK time has some play in it, i used to leave my game on to avoid people watching the decay timer. maybe +/- some hours for that.  
math is assuming 8 hours for a year is about 3000 hours. so realistically probably about 18-20k hours? ill put that into the edit right now
        I don't believe it. I could make a guess and say i played 40k hours. You can literally see hours played on any platform. There are people who play this game for a living and have no where near 20k
    probably going off steam playtime, which include time afk looking at wiki or leaving game running to load mods for server etc...
Cut your losses and go learn a trade so you can get a job.
    This i would honestly say getting certified for a trade like elctrician or plumbing or mechanic is the single best thing you can do to secure a comfortable life, to the point you should leave school to start earlier if possible.
    If OP can hyper focus like this on something he loves but also hates, I can damn well guarantee he could do the same with a trade and do journeyman level work much sooner than an apprenticeship would end and artisanal quality work very quickly.
        working on it actually, ive been a fan of engineering and ive just recently enrolled for some community college classes for my senior year.
            Hell yeah my dude. After seeing the opportunities in life thrown my wife‚Äôs way as an engineer I recommend absolutely everyone to get a stem degree. Doesn‚Äôt matter if they use it in their careers, the odds are just better in their favor having a stem degree. You can get hired in practically any corporation with a stem degree and you basically are limited by you aren‚Äôt a lawyer, and you aren‚Äôt a doctor, but you can work anywhere.
    20k hours is over 2 years straight! If you spend the your next 20k hours in a trade you will be very happy in your 30‚Äôs you‚Äôll be set up for success. Also look back at your play time and appreciate the fact you live in a time where you can spend 20k hours playing a game.
Look dude. I was your age a few years ago. I‚Äôm 23 now. Avid gamer. Had thousands upon thousands of game time in WoW. I think I had like 5 years played time total by the time I was 19? And that‚Äôs just in that game alone. 
Now I‚Äôm a neuroscientist. As a teenager, you‚Äôre not supposed to have a life. Everyone else your age is what? Partying? At least you‚Äôre safe in your bedroom. Point is: don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it. You have the rest of your life ahead of you.
Take this as a learning opportunity, learn how to balance life & hobbies, put this energy towards college or a career when you‚Äôre out of high school.
Hey man, I feel you. I dropped outta HS my sophomore year, took me 2 weeks to get my GED but couldn‚Äôt do shit cause I didn‚Äôt graduate HS. Spent an ABSURD amount of time on ark and made some awesome friends that I still talk to 8 years later. It helped me cope with personal issues and funny enough, helped substantially with time management. Don‚Äôt look at it all as a negative.
Fuck that. I'm 20 years older and times were different, but I was partying and chasing girls and ducking off. Sad to see THAT many hours spent on anything.. imagine of he put 25000 into a real physical hobby how badass he would be at it. I'm a huge gamer but balance man.  Also you have to be REAL careful with anything in the mmo world.  You can easily become a slave to them.. I say best case you just o in at launch and give it 3-4 months then jump off. Now I only play single player games for the most part 

To each his own
In 2015 when I get out the army, I picked up ESO. Over the next 6 years I played every day, at least 6-8 hours a day. Maybe more. I didn't give any other game a try. I missed out of so many different things in life. I lost 6 jobs and was almost homeless. One day I got into a big fight with the people I was playing with and didn't log on for a few days to spite them, that turned into a few weeks, which ended up being 2 years now. All of a sudden I had time to do other things, the world opened up to me. I remember it became more of a chore to do anything, and I dreaded playing the game, but the time and money investment is what got me to stay. Fast forward to now, I still play, mostly casually, a few hours a week now, mostly cause my wife plays with me. I did take a few short brakes from ESO to play ARK 24/7 too. Then DayZ nonstop. I don't wish this kind of lifestyle on anyone. Games are fun, but they should never be a chore or control your life.
I have somewhere between 10k and 15k hours just between rust and dayz and I will tell you that I can relate, there has been times where the "waking up just to get on" has been a real problem and it will pass and life goes on... don't regret it because you know you had good times and learned valuable lessons whether it's social skills or strategy or just learning common sense you know... look for the positives in the situation rather than fixating on the negs...

Everything gonna be alright Lil bro![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
Totally agree I mean u are 17 it's okay to have fun at that age, yet 25k hours u could of definitely made some strides for the future, I have the same problem I feel like the only thing that gives me enjoyment in life is playing.
As a 30 yo I am only now getting mad about how much time I wasted in video games trying to escape my life instead of improving it. So good for you op on figuring that out younger then I did! In our defense though video games are cool and where else will we be able to live out our fantasies of being a wizard or a alien or whatever! Also gotta realize the social aspect some of my best/longest friends were met on a video game! Heck I met my best friends on ark looking for featherlights in abzone on val! ü§£ my tribe in the game is now my tribe irl! My best advice is moderation!
"... and I'm 17."

You're a kid. You're not supposed to have a life. You're supposed to enjoy being happy while it lasts. Stop complaining about having free time. Once you become an adult those 8 hours a day of ARK will turn into 8 hours a day of work.

Enjoy it while you can. Happy trails.
    Couldn‚Äôt agree more lmao.
I'm 36 years old and I have been playing D2 everyday since February 19th, 2008. I'm over 100k hours in. I'm a no-lifer. You are inspiring kid. Maybe I can break away from D2 one day.. yea right..
    are you talking about destiny two?
        Diablo II LOD. I have never played console just PC. Destiny doesn't look like a game I could play for more than 5 minutes. Tbh.
            id love to believe you but 100k hours is crazy. could you throw some proof out?
Please just enjoy it. Ark or anything, life gets a lot less full of time after 21 and I wish I would‚Äôve made more time for myself as a kid‚Ä¶
Why is everyone writing so long stories I don't have time to read bruh
    bippity bop  
bippity boo  
you deserve wet socks  
wet socks for you!
        Aww hell naw man 
I just don't like reading texts for hours
My ark playtime was 1.2k hours (ark mobile)
BEFORE I DELETED IT
I‚Äôve put a lot of hours into Ark too. I hosted a server on xbox and on PC for a few years. I‚Äôve played mod servers relentlessly and made a lot of friends and of course gamer enemies. üëç

Ark is one of the best strategy multiplayer games I‚Äôve played over the years. Going way back, I was laddering at the top of more than a few games. I‚Äôve been called a cheater when I wasn‚Äôt cheating so many time I can‚Äôt count them. 

I don‚Äôt think of my time spent as a gamer as wasted. No way. I‚Äôm proud of it. It all comes down to having a purpose as a human being and waking up in the morning with that purpose in mind. That‚Äôs really what‚Äôs important regardless of what the purpose is. Remember that. As long as you have purpose, you‚Äôre doing it right.
    problem is when that purpose is overriding things like school, eating, and important social events. i skipped a funeral to do a raid, yeah it wasnt someone i knew super well, but they were blood. and i regret skipping it to play a game.
Honestly its terrible that you feel this way, but nobody made you spend that much time on a game. You have to learn how to balance entertainment and the rest of life on your own and eventually you'll find the right mix. Maybe try a summer job or somethin to get ya on a schedule of sorts.
As an adult gamer, hold on to your games cause when you get older and start to lose your ability to do stuff you will need some way to escape

    Interesting take considering OP didn‚Äôt blame ‚Äúthe game‚Äù or ‚Äúthe company‚Äù in any way what so ever.
    who said i was blaming the game company? i dont think alot of games make their game inherently addictive. im acknoledging the faults i have and trying to make people notice the shit behavior they might also have. ARK is an amazing game, my hours speak to that, and i cant think of alot of happy moments in my life where ark wasnt involved. but i wish that i didnt spend 20k hours raising dinos, and fucking around inside. because im feeling the consequences of that dependecy now as im preparing for college and my real life. my grades were shit because i was playing a game about dinos, so now i cant go to a four year. thats the type of fuck up im referencing
        I wouldn‚Äôt discount the significance of going to a community college. In my state many of the community colleges guarantee admission to a 4-year after completing your AA. In community college, focus on completing your core curriculum and figure out where you want to go from there. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid to take a gap year between AA and State University either to spend time volunteering with an organization like Peace Corps, WWOOF, or similar. That world experience helps pad your resume and give additional experience when you come back to finish your degree.

It‚Äôs just high school, and your future employers don‚Äôt care. If you played online, you may even have connections to others that could help you get to where you want to be - just because you‚Äôre online friends doesn‚Äôt make them any less important in your network.

EDIT: I‚Äôm not sure why someone downvoted me. I went to a 4-year and later continued my education at a community college. The education received was comparable, and the money saved by going to a community college was significant ($120 per credit vs. $300 per credit). It‚Äôs perfectly fine to go to a community college for your core curriculum and later transfer to a 4-year.
            i do have connections from ark actually, ive got a friend in MIT whos a professor and said hed willing to send in a recommendation. im hoping that if i decide to take that route im able to do so. we will see!
                As someone who works in the music industry where connections are EVERYTHING, the best piece of advice I have for people in other fields (or heading into other fields in your case) is never be afraid to lean on connections. I‚Äôve seen far too many skilled people fail simply because they didn‚Äôt put the time in to nurturing connections they have and the less talented person did.
Maybe that is someones hobby. Just because you feel like you wasted your life does not mean someone else does their time will come if need be
    "and you find yourself waking up JUST to get on, and sacrificing things for it, pay the money for a therapist, it helped me so much"  
im referencing the idea of sacrificing things in your life for a game.
Bunch of cry babies pussies if you ask me. Man this new generation is soft.
    would you be saying the same thing about a 17yo being addicted to drugs? your just fucking insensitive.   
  
P.S- m not comparing a gaming addiction to heroin, im talking about those kinds of addictions, the kind where you start depending on it.
Best advice is to hop back on ark and finish what you started
    Yah no one likes a quitter
    i still hop on fiber craft every now and then just to play with friends. never going back to official lol
We love you!
Ark is better when you already have all your i‚Äôs dotted and t‚Äôs crossed,
Career and life set out
I think it‚Äôs a good lesson to be learned that applies everywhere in life. Addiction. I know you hear that word and panic or think ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt addiction‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs important to take everything in moderation. 
I was a lifelong World of Warcraft players, one of the loading screens says ‚ÄúRemember to take everything in moderation, including World of Warcraft!‚Äù Didn‚Äôt really resonance til I got older and was like ‚Äúoh, I get it‚Äù. Haha sounds silly. But at least you recognized it and got it front of it. I struggle with an addictive personality, I have to limit my game time like a 9 year old, lol. I could easily sink back into that, but I have a house, job, etc. I can‚Äôt afford to burn 8 hours a day anymore.
Good on you for getting in front of it! You got this.
If you want to really get depressed, multiply that play time by minimum wage and see how much money you could have in the bank.
    Imagine working 12 years at 40 hours a week minimum wage. No thanks I‚Äôd rather play ark
        Good luck paying for the bills to support your gameplay with no job, unless you're one of those who has no shame sucking on the governments tit while the rest of us actually contribute to society.
            Minimum wage workers are the most government subsidized people in the country they get foodstamps and Medicaid to help them.

All I‚Äôm saying is the money you think would be in the bank wouldn‚Äôt be there and the depression would be higher
                I see your point, but a job gives some sense of purpose, pride, and accomplishment, not to mention the social aspects.  Yes, you meet people playing games online, but actually interacting with people face to face is different.
This was me and my boyfriend in 2018-2020. I stopped playing until recently but chose single player on easy mode on ASA. I wanted a chill experience without the negativity that i experienced in pvp ark in 2018. Which is a whole separate issue but yea.. i limit my time on the game now and im chillin
You see your dedication for this game, what do you have planned for the rest of your life. You see the launch of most AAA games now being shit. Use thus passion for this dinosaur game and use it to learn to make your own better ark type shit if you don't have an idea what to do. There's plenty of free sources online to get a head start. I'm not sure what's used now a days and I haven't been there for years but codeacademy has free coding lessons to get started
You say get a hobby, I say gaming is a hobby.

Obviously, if it's caused you distress and getting a therapist helped you then props to you for having the mental fortitude to ask for help, not everyone does.
Hey just wanted to say great post.  But it‚Äôs not just the younger generation suffering from video game addiction.  It‚Äôs happening to tons of people and is a very very real threat to mental health.
I tried to play ark and when a buddy explained that he needed me to wake up every hour or so all night for like a week for some fake baby dragon j decided that I'd play casually but anything more than that just wasn't for me.
People don't realize how dangerous a gaming addiction can be. No matter how old you are, how many hours you have put in a game or the fact that "it's not like i'm doing drugs", it can destroy a life. Gaming is supposed to be fun. It's not supposed to make you obsessed to the point that you don't take care of yourself.
Not just an issue for younger folks. Many people want an escape, and many forget they have to come back to the real world.
I've never had that much time in any game, I had less than 8k in the game I played the most ever and it took me 8 years to even clock that much on it.
Feel like this is something every younger gamer eventually realizes that gaming needs to have a balance and games with a ingame rust offline raid culture like ark is really demanding and somewhat unfair sucks people in and becomes more of a time waster not only cause they‚Äôre spending more time on it than other games but the time spent is just logging in to
Maintain and protect things you have not having fun. That‚Äôs why people who play these games are a specific type of gamer that clearly thinks it‚Äôs much more serious or has that type of aggressive gaming culture.
    I played a lot of ark but offline and even offline the grind and difficulty feels unbalanced at times and ‚Äúsingle player mode‚Äù is a appeasement joke that makes the game the opposite and like youre a 4 year old playing it.  Ark is fun but take breaks prioritize shit. It‚Äôs just one of them games eventually the online base would disappear anyway when you get bored and some other guy whose probably a douche will build there lol
Imagine paying a therapist for your Ark addiction. I have those hours and im 25 with full time job, house, brand new car, wife that doesn't work, 800 credit score, investments, and easily saving money for my retirement. I been playing ark like 6 hours a day since i was 17 and still do. Just make smart financial decisions, and create time for yourself, if you use all your free time for ark who gives a shit. Just make sure you got your business done at the end of the day.
    thats the issue, it wasnt in moderation, im sure playing for 6 hours a day is fine for alot of people, but what i had was a problem. 12-18 hours a day is no longer for fun. the therapist had alot to do with stuff outside of ark and mostly dealing with the emotions around the addiction rather than the addiction. game addiction often has underlying issues rather then just "hehe game fun"
I mean it‚Äôs great you got out of the loop hole now as you‚Äôre going into adulthood, it took me until the age of 23 to really call it quits. Hate this shit ass game with its horrible developers. Always being blue balled and just always being disappointed. Ark has so much potential but the devs are just so bad it‚Äôs sad. Really loved this game but man I wasted soo much time on it.
I wish my girlfriend's son thought this way. All that kid  does is sit around and play video games and he expects his mom just to take care of him. He's 21 going on 22. The kid doesn't even have a driver's license. I've known him for 4 years and he's worked a total of 2 weeks out of those 4 years
44 year old dude here. I have an addiction to Sea of Thieves. When I was younger I would vehemently deny ‚Äúgaming addiction‚Äù. It‚Äôs very real. 

I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve seen the light. Good luck Sir!
    appreciate it! and sea of theives is fun as shit, got maybe 200 hours in it lol
I would half agree with you mainly due to the hours put In. I definitely had my fair share of gaming hours and yes I regret playing so much because I could have been spending time learning that I love let's say cars and making a life around that. This situation is different judging from the part where he said "tough times" but he obviously is regretting playing sooo much and it makes sense. He also has relized that there is so much more to life than games. That's what matters is making that realization stepping back from that one thing but keeping in mind it's okay to play games.
    yea i totally agree that‚Äôs why i said the hours are impressive if anything. Stop doing that, probably don‚Äôt play dino game cus maybe you‚Äôll slip back into that, but don‚Äôt be ashamed just move on. Who the fuck cares? At least we have the privilege to ‚Äúwaste our time‚Äù we could be child slaves in the industrial boom.
        Yes no shame just move on I agree.
His life already started. He may find out later that he actually enjoys spending time outside a computer and he has responsibilities and little free time left. Or even worse...gaming is highly addictive and he might never find out what other things life has to offer due to this.

Gaming is fun but it's another activity and shouldn't be the sole source of entertainment or "passion" in anyone's life, much less a kid. He is still in development btw. For the record, I also judge binging on series or movies or endless scrolling as sole hobbies.
    ya i‚Äôm not saying to go back to being a hardcore gamer pal‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm saying that spending a couple years being a gamer playing dino game isn‚Äôt shameful. it isn‚Äôt your place to judge people for how they spend their time. not everybody has to be great and do great or worthwhile things. it‚Äôs cool, inherently, to go on adventures, but it‚Äôs not our business if someone would rather raise digital dinos. peace!
        I would agree with all that you were saying if the gaming hours he listed weren't so extreme and he wasn't a *kid* that is still growing. So many hours before the screen and being hyperstimulated do mess up with your neural connections, especially at that age. If it's a summer or two being cooped up building bases or raising high-level Gigas, it's harmless, but that's not what it sounds like in OP's situation.

Here, have your "peace" back. I'm not a "bro" nor in a Seth Rogen comedy üëã
            this\^  
im not talking about having something to escape, and thats what it was for me for say the first thousand hours, but after that it became a dependancy, and THATS where its bad.
                I'm happy that you are actively trying to break free from that dependency, looking to do things and trying to enjoy your time also offline ‚ú®Ô∏è You're 17 and really young and I'm sure you have lots of cool stuff and experiences ahead of you! Whatever you live, try to live with awareness and purpose.

Good luck  ‚ú®Ô∏è üçÄ

                i‚Äôm glad you got help but i want to clarify dude i‚Äôm not saying what you were doing was okay. I‚Äôm saying the alternatives for someone your age aren‚Äôt gonna be amazing or necessarily worthwhile. So fucking what you played too much video games! You don‚Äôt have to warn others. It‚Äôs a part of living and learning. You‚Äôre past that, so just do better. Jesus christ you reddit crowd are so dramatic‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt that serious lmao thos guy *actually* pulled a Zoolander on me

Society doesnt really allow for that though. making freinds and aquantences and egtting involved in extra curreiculars teams/groups gives you an incredible advantage in gettings jobs and general life support.
    that‚Äôs not necessarily true i don‚Äôt think the richest people on the planet spent their time playing sports or chumming it up i think they sat and worked and worked and worked. There are different paths. You can work to the top, you can settle somewhere in the middle, or you can live small. No wrong answers. We‚Äôve already reached the final frontier. We are discovering the power of quantum computing and AI is evolving every day. Let the kid play dino game.
        Richest people in world are the Arnault family who are the biggest construction company in the world. Bernard the current fmaily head got his start with a small loan of $15 mil and just bought a bunch of already successful cosmetic companies. He is litterally the out of touch manchild stereotype you sin in movies and shows.

Elon 2nd richest has a history of "co founding" successful companies where hes basically the "ideas guy" and his partner does all the work. Hes now a full time twitter troll, with a wake of failed bussiness and relationships behind him.

Bezos at spot 3 started out with a small loan fo $300k from the bank of mum and dad and once again immediately hired other people to do the work for him. Now hes head of the most explotative company in the world.

We do not live in a meritocracy we live in a captalist plutarchy.
This is sketchy advice. He basically played around 6 hours per day on average if he literally never skipped a day, ever. OP is very mature for acknowledging how it took over his life.
10,000+ hours in a game that will eventually get deleted instead of spending some of that time developing their character, skills and relationships is not ok. Stop trying to make each other feel better about a genuine addiction. This will harm a young adults future.
Damn üòÇ dude is a no-life man-child
    He was not like that when we met, but he went through a rough patch caused by health problems and then it all went downhill. Unfortunately, there are people who don't know how to cope with pain in a healthy manner and resort to addictive habits to numb it all out.

It's really sad watching someone you love push you and any help offered away, whilst they are just digging themselves into a deeper hole. But it's up to him to get a grip on his life now.
Same, played destiny from 17-26 years old and then realized how much time I was wasting just bc fomo and really didn‚Äôt enjoy the game that much anymore and quit cold turkey, havnt looked back since.
Right the math don't math up
i didnt think about it, id have to do the math but AFK time has some play in it, i used to leave my game on to avoid people watching the decay timer. maybe +/- some hours for that.  
math is assuming 8 hours for a year is about 3000 hours. so realistically probably about 18-20k hours? ill put that into the edit right now
    I don't believe it. I could make a guess and say i played 40k hours. You can literally see hours played on any platform. There are people who play this game for a living and have no where near 20k
probably going off steam playtime, which include time afk looking at wiki or leaving game running to load mods for server etc...
This i would honestly say getting certified for a trade like elctrician or plumbing or mechanic is the single best thing you can do to secure a comfortable life, to the point you should leave school to start earlier if possible.
If OP can hyper focus like this on something he loves but also hates, I can damn well guarantee he could do the same with a trade and do journeyman level work much sooner than an apprenticeship would end and artisanal quality work very quickly.
    working on it actually, ive been a fan of engineering and ive just recently enrolled for some community college classes for my senior year.
        Hell yeah my dude. After seeing the opportunities in life thrown my wife‚Äôs way as an engineer I recommend absolutely everyone to get a stem degree. Doesn‚Äôt matter if they use it in their careers, the odds are just better in their favor having a stem degree. You can get hired in practically any corporation with a stem degree and you basically are limited by you aren‚Äôt a lawyer, and you aren‚Äôt a doctor, but you can work anywhere.
20k hours is over 2 years straight! If you spend the your next 20k hours in a trade you will be very happy in your 30‚Äôs you‚Äôll be set up for success. Also look back at your play time and appreciate the fact you live in a time where you can spend 20k hours playing a game.
Couldn‚Äôt agree more lmao.
are you talking about destiny two?
    Diablo II LOD. I have never played console just PC. Destiny doesn't look like a game I could play for more than 5 minutes. Tbh.
        id love to believe you but 100k hours is crazy. could you throw some proof out?
bippity bop  
bippity boo  
you deserve wet socks  
wet socks for you!
    Aww hell naw man 
I just don't like reading texts for hours
My ark playtime was 1.2k hours (ark mobile)
BEFORE I DELETED IT
problem is when that purpose is overriding things like school, eating, and important social events. i skipped a funeral to do a raid, yeah it wasnt someone i knew super well, but they were blood. and i regret skipping it to play a game.
Interesting take considering OP didn‚Äôt blame ‚Äúthe game‚Äù or ‚Äúthe company‚Äù in any way what so ever.
who said i was blaming the game company? i dont think alot of games make their game inherently addictive. im acknoledging the faults i have and trying to make people notice the shit behavior they might also have. ARK is an amazing game, my hours speak to that, and i cant think of alot of happy moments in my life where ark wasnt involved. but i wish that i didnt spend 20k hours raising dinos, and fucking around inside. because im feeling the consequences of that dependecy now as im preparing for college and my real life. my grades were shit because i was playing a game about dinos, so now i cant go to a four year. thats the type of fuck up im referencing
    I wouldn‚Äôt discount the significance of going to a community college. In my state many of the community colleges guarantee admission to a 4-year after completing your AA. In community college, focus on completing your core curriculum and figure out where you want to go from there. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid to take a gap year between AA and State University either to spend time volunteering with an organization like Peace Corps, WWOOF, or similar. That world experience helps pad your resume and give additional experience when you come back to finish your degree.

It‚Äôs just high school, and your future employers don‚Äôt care. If you played online, you may even have connections to others that could help you get to where you want to be - just because you‚Äôre online friends doesn‚Äôt make them any less important in your network.

EDIT: I‚Äôm not sure why someone downvoted me. I went to a 4-year and later continued my education at a community college. The education received was comparable, and the money saved by going to a community college was significant ($120 per credit vs. $300 per credit). It‚Äôs perfectly fine to go to a community college for your core curriculum and later transfer to a 4-year.
        i do have connections from ark actually, ive got a friend in MIT whos a professor and said hed willing to send in a recommendation. im hoping that if i decide to take that route im able to do so. we will see!
            As someone who works in the music industry where connections are EVERYTHING, the best piece of advice I have for people in other fields (or heading into other fields in your case) is never be afraid to lean on connections. I‚Äôve seen far too many skilled people fail simply because they didn‚Äôt put the time in to nurturing connections they have and the less talented person did.
"and you find yourself waking up JUST to get on, and sacrificing things for it, pay the money for a therapist, it helped me so much"  
im referencing the idea of sacrificing things in your life for a game.
would you be saying the same thing about a 17yo being addicted to drugs? your just fucking insensitive.   
  
P.S- m not comparing a gaming addiction to heroin, im talking about those kinds of addictions, the kind where you start depending on it.
Yah no one likes a quitter
i still hop on fiber craft every now and then just to play with friends. never going back to official lol
Imagine working 12 years at 40 hours a week minimum wage. No thanks I‚Äôd rather play ark
    Good luck paying for the bills to support your gameplay with no job, unless you're one of those who has no shame sucking on the governments tit while the rest of us actually contribute to society.
        Minimum wage workers are the most government subsidized people in the country they get foodstamps and Medicaid to help them.

All I‚Äôm saying is the money you think would be in the bank wouldn‚Äôt be there and the depression would be higher
            I see your point, but a job gives some sense of purpose, pride, and accomplishment, not to mention the social aspects.  Yes, you meet people playing games online, but actually interacting with people face to face is different.
I played a lot of ark but offline and even offline the grind and difficulty feels unbalanced at times and ‚Äúsingle player mode‚Äù is a appeasement joke that makes the game the opposite and like youre a 4 year old playing it.  Ark is fun but take breaks prioritize shit. It‚Äôs just one of them games eventually the online base would disappear anyway when you get bored and some other guy whose probably a douche will build there lol
thats the issue, it wasnt in moderation, im sure playing for 6 hours a day is fine for alot of people, but what i had was a problem. 12-18 hours a day is no longer for fun. the therapist had alot to do with stuff outside of ark and mostly dealing with the emotions around the addiction rather than the addiction. game addiction often has underlying issues rather then just "hehe game fun"
appreciate it! and sea of theives is fun as shit, got maybe 200 hours in it lol
yea i totally agree that‚Äôs why i said the hours are impressive if anything. Stop doing that, probably don‚Äôt play dino game cus maybe you‚Äôll slip back into that, but don‚Äôt be ashamed just move on. Who the fuck cares?
