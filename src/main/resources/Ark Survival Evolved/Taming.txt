[[Taming]]


How the heck do you take a Dino on this game? I‚Äôm playing Ark Ascended on Xbox and I tamed this Dino doing absolutely nothing! It just jumped at me and then it was tamed?! I‚Äôm so confused, please help!

So i remember my confusion back in 2014 so I will try to make it as simple as I can.

Most creatures you see in this game are tameable. The methods vary a little bit. 

1. MOST (Like 75%) are so called Knock-out tames. I will explain it in more detail since it's the most important one.

It means you have to get  the Dino unconscious. And then when you walk up to it you can open it's inventory and put meat or berries in. 

Once they're hungry they will eat and everytime they eat the taming bar fills up a little. If the food is tastier the bar will fill more ( kibble, prime meat, mutton are the best).  

Sometimes a dino might wake up before it eats enough to tame so you want to put narcotic or narco berries in it's inventory and forcefeed it that. ( IT WONT EAT NAFCOTICS AUTOMATICLY LIKE THE FOOD YOU HAVE TO PRESS E)

It's also best to wait and then put the food in since by that point they will eat everything at once because their more hungry and the effectiveness won't go down. Once the bar is full. Bingo your new Dino.

*How do you get them unconcious ?*

Many things can inflict torpor your fists or a slingshot. However I recommend waiting until you unlock narcotic. You make narcotic by mixing spoiled meat and narco berries in a mortar and pestle (which you can unlock pretty early.) the narcotic itself is used to make Dinos stay asleep longer.

But if you mix Narcotic with an arrow you get a tranq arrow. Shoot from somewhere high and you can knock most things out. 


2. Some have passive taming. You have to put the right food into the last slot and then you can feed the manually. By walking up to them or in that case you showed the Dino will steal it from you and that way tame. 

3. Specific taming methods. 

Now Ark has like 200 creatures so some have one of a kind taming methods. I recommend looking most of them up. There aren't that many of them. 

4. Get an Egg

From some creatures you have to get an egg which you can hatch and imprint. But there aren't tames like this on the island I believe.

5. Imprint 

Now this isn't a taming method. But a method you can get a new tame in ASA without taming. In ASA you will see babies. If you kill the parents and walk up to it you can imprint it. It will eventually grow up to be an adult. 

GOOD RULE OF THUMB
- If it has sharp teeth don't try to passive tame it. Don't walk up to a spino to feed it berries. The only carnivore passive tame in this game I believe is the carchadontosaurus. 
- Herbivores are usually friendly except if they have long claws beware of the tickle chicken. 
- Don't fly though the redwoods only above unless you want a hug
- Make use of bolas in the early game. 


O and start Singleplayer if your new. Hope I could somewhat help and didn't confuse you more.
    I love ‚Äútickle chickens‚Äù
        I always call them "Murder Turkeys"
    \*Diplodocus has entered the chat\*
        Well he doesn't do damage he's like a therizinotryhard.
    Hyenadon is also passive, gotta be hidden
        Such good doggos they just want pets.
    Arthroplura and mantis are passive tames. Hyenadon. The new scorched lizard. Vultures are passive. Titanoboa. Theres a bunch that arent in asa yet too as far as passive tame carnis.
        The new scorched lizard is a ko tame  even if the way you gotta knock it out is rather unique
            Fair point. It works kinda like the equus or the andrew, but true it does get ko'd technically. So its more of a cross between equus and elemental/karkinos, you ride it and knock it out with a unique method.
        The new Deinosuchus is passive too, I think.
        I didn't count Arthoplaura because for me it's in the creepy crawlys edition. 
Scorched earth dinos I didn't mention because I didn't wanna rattle through all the the dlcs. Fjordhawk is a passive tame too. 

Hyeanadon I honestly forgot about thx
    Such a well thought out and informative response. Take my up-doots!
    Hyenadon are also a passive tame
It grabbed berries out of your inventory. That‚Äôs how you tame it.
    That is so confusing ü´§ I‚Äôm still tryna figure out the controls of this game lol
        There are a variation of ways to tame depending on what Dino you‚Äôre after. The most common for most Dino‚Äôs is to knock it unconscious and feed it the preferred food while keeping it asleep until it is tamed. 

A good way to check is using the dododex app
        Dododex and the official wiki are good for figuring stuff out. Dododex has a good calculator for telling you the resources you need to tame something, and the wiki has a page on the controls and on basically everything.

https://ark.wiki.gg/wiki/Controls

This is the page I used to figure out the controls when I first started playing.¬†
        they like to steal things, so if they steal food from you that would be used to tame them, it will act like a sort of passive taming.

sorry if this is a bit confusing of a explanation :(
The trick to taming this dino is by having berries in inventory and pray it steals berries other than other stuff. Thats how i tamed mines. Ezpz

P.S i love how you named it Rando, because it was a random tame üòÖ
    It always steals the last hotbar slot if you have something there (rip my spyglas)
        They always take my spyglass and run straight into a pack of carnos üòûüòû
            Always my parachute... Don't know how many times I've chased those down ty
        I was trading with someone. Half a stack of metal and bro stole that and i never saw him again
    Yeah, didn‚Äôt think anyone would catch that üòÇ
        I named one of my tames "please don't die"..... because they were all getting got by carnos or raptors..... and guess what happened to "please don't die"?
            He begged for mercy?
            Lived a long and happy life then peacefully passed away in their sleep from old age?
                That's exactly what happened. After he was mauled by a tickle chicken.
    So that's how I got that random pego when I first started. I accidentally killed it immediately because I didn't know it was a shoulder pet and I was stabbing at piranhas and he got in the way. I thought you had to punch them in the face at the exact moment they steal because that's what happened lol
        Lmao ü§£
You've received some good general advise. So I want to talk a bit more in depth about the ones that are present in the image specifically...

Firstly, there's the **Pegomastyx** (the larger one a.k.a pego/pegger/fuzz thief/moth\*# F&\*%&#NG pie&% of \*&\^% son of a %\^$&\^!). 

The taming mechanic for these is stealing berries from you. Had it not been so low level (I assume low/default settings) it would have taken several rounds of stealing berries to tame. Where it would grab some, run away from you, then come back after a while. Something important to note about these is that they will steal other stuff from you if berries are not in your inventory or on your bar. But they will almost always take what is on the last slot of your bar before anything else (Because that's where the taming food is meant to go). The only exceptions are if there's nothing there and/or something in your hands. 

When it steals from you. You have until the bag in it's hands disappears to reclaim your items by killing it. A bola can stop it in it's tracks. But like all things that can be bola'd, if they have a leap forward attack (sabers, raptors, pegos) you need to side step as you bola and not get in front of them when attacking, while they are bola'd with a pego this is especially important, because when you attack it you cancel the cooldown on it's ability to steal from you.

So for instance it could steal the best weapon you ever had, then you bola it and start attacking it in time to kill it and get it back. but you stood too close to it's front and it stole from you again, which overwrites the last item it stole.

When one pego steals from you look out. Because they often spawn in groups of 3. So if you get hit by one another is likely not far behind and it's easy to loose 2 or 3 valuables and have to pick a pego to chase down. Letting the other stuff disappear in the process. One neat trick you can do is use their taming mechanic to keep track of where the pegos in the area you're operating in are. Just let one steal some berries from your last slot (I always keep stim berries on last slot as I can eat them running at full speed to escape something and they're easy to replace). Then use the taming tracker to put a marker on them. 

On PvP these can be used to steal from other players. They can also be commanded to harvest specific bushes for berries. And while they have low yield as a berry picker, they're pretty good at finding seeds while doing so. Which isn't a bad way to obtain all desired seeds early on.

Now as for **Compies**...Be careful. Those hearts are not for you. That's a sign that their respective damage is boosted by being within range of another of their kind that is the opposite sex (called a mate boost). And individual Compy or even a pair won't attack unless provoked. But the ones that follow you around will occasionally call out to others of their kind to enlist help. Once they have 3 or more it's dinner time. They'll attack you from all side. often 5-10 of them. Every additional member in the group adds a damage multiplier to each individual up to 7. So these can become very dangerous, very quickly.

They are also a bit annoying to actually tame. Because they are a knockout tame but they only tame off raw high quality meats (prime, prime fish and mutton). Those have a quicker spoil timer and are more difficult to obtain when starting out. They really aren't worth the effort either from a practicality stand point. Of course not everything you tame will be about practicality or optimal trajectory. Somethings you'll just like and want or tame because it was convenient. That's fine too. It's just to say that compies are outmatched as pack hunters by virtually everything else you could tame and they have the least utility as a shoulder pet. I'd personally rather let 4 raw prime spoil in my inventory than feed it to a knocked compy. Because being made into narcotic is more useful in theory than a compy is in practice.
    I was about to ask too, why the heck those little guys (Compies) keep following me, I thought they were glitched or something‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt know it was a trick/ambush. Also while I‚Äôm here asking questions. What are those little things in the corner when you mount a Dino? There‚Äôs a green one holding hands for one and another it‚Äôs red with a volume symbol that‚Äôs slashes and there‚Äôs a timer?
        Those are status effect icons. [Here](https://ark.wiki.gg/wiki/Category:Status_effect_icons) you'll be able to pick them out and read the descriptions. A few will have a timer or percentage sign on them in-game. Indicating time remaining or severity of effect. Generally speaking if a status effect has a chalk scribbled green background it's good and if it's red it's bad.

I think the ones you specifically mention are:

Fist bump = You have the imprint bonus (raises base damage and damage resistance while the person who has full imprint - from raising the animal properly - is riding it).

Speaker icon = It's special ability has been silenced/muted for a time (can be from effect of another creature or simply a cooldown on using an ability).
            Ohhh, thx so much!
                I should also mention that there is a function in-game to show extended HUD information. This will actually put a brief description over those icons (as well as showing temperature outside time and that sort of info). See the HUD section of [this](https://ark.wiki.gg/wiki/Controls) page to find what the control for that is for your platform/input device.
It steals a stack of food from your inventory to tame 
The more food in the stack the faster it'll tame
    Its berries it has to steal for it to tame. It stealking meat or any type of food wont work. Tho you are right about the high amount of food in stack the faster the tame will be
Several different ways of taming, according to different creatures, pego is the only one that does that. This compy, for instance you have to knock out, recommend tranq arrows, find some prime meat to put in their inventory once they are knocked out. Prime meat can be gotten early game by killing babies(just be aware of the parents) and diplodocus, since they can push you around but do no damage, unless they push you into something or off a cliff.
Get dododex.

Honestly huge help in this game. :)
For compy‚Äôs, it‚Äôs a knock out prime meat tame. Very annoying to do
You had food in your inventory which it stole and ate which tamed the pegostomax, most tames are knock outs though meaning you raise their torpor high with things like a club or tranq arrows and you put food in their inventory
Tame*
That's called a passive tame. It took berries from your inventory, especially if those berries were in the last slot of your hotbar. There are some other dinos that require passive tame methods as well, such as being handfed certain foods in the wild or using special methods that might require some Googling to figure out. 

A grand majority of the dinos are knockout tamed which as the name suggests, requires you to knock the dinos out via punching, clubbing, slingshot, tranq arrows and so on. Then when the dinos fall unconscious, you would put its preferred taming foods into its inventory, possibly along with some narcoberries or narcotics. If the torpor is dropping faster than it is gaining taming progress, then you will need to forcefeed it those narcoberries or narcotics to keep it sleeping and wait until it finishes taming.

I recommend looking up some of the things you're interested in doing or taming on ark.wiki.gg or Dododex, which are highly useful and informative resources. YouTube also has almost everything you might want to know as well
Most tames are knockouts. But that one is a special kind of passive tame. It steals berries from you and depending on berries and amount it took can tame pretty quick sometimes instant. But yeah most tames need to be dealt torpor to be knocked out and fed food
Pegomastax steal from your inventory. If it steals berriers, it begins to tame. 

This one is very low level, so it probably tamed instantly with a single berry, giving you a shock.

They steal from your 0 hotbar slot first, so it is advisable to hold some trash item or berries there, otherwise they will steal a random stack from you, which can be expensive.

---

Pegos have a relatively unique taming mechanic.

For most other things you need to knock them unconcious with thing that do torpor damage(like clubs, rocks from a slingshot, narcotic arrows, etc.)
This dino has a specific tame method that is different from from other dinos. You can tame it by accident sometimes. It will jump at you and steal the item that is put into the last slot of your hotbar (slot 0). If there is no item there, then it will steal a random item from your inventory. It can steal anything from you.

A good strategy is to have some crap item on slot 0, like a few berries, so it won't steal something important form you. However this dino will tame itself by stealing food from you. So if there is food on slot 0 and it steals, it can just tame itself. Usually for high levels you need more steal attempts, but for a low level even a few berries can be enough.

So that's what happened. You had some food in slot 0, guy stole it and tamed himself by accident. Just keep him. You can carry him on your shoulder and give him items to carry for you. If you have a shoulder pet and give it something, when  you pick it up, the item will only weigh half for you. So if you give it 10kg and pick it up, it will only count as 5 for you, which is pretty nice.
That happened the first time I ran into one to. Then I said, no you thief!! I then killed them as my tame and took my stuff back‚Ä¶üòÇ
Most animals you see will be knockout tames (meaning you need tranq arrows or blunt force like your fist to knock them out) like the dodo or parasaur for example and then need you to input food like berries or meat into their inventory for them to consume. Then there are passive tames where you feed them something or pet them like with the hyenadon and Moschops. Finally there is the creature you‚Äôre talking about which is the most annoying piece of shit in this game called the pegomastax (I think that‚Äôs how you spell it) where if you have berries in your last slot and he steals something from you. It tames him and he can steal stuff from other people and also fight for you but it can‚Äôt do much as it‚Äôs weak. Can maybe kill a dilo at best. If you wanna know what specific things eat and how to knock them out then download an app called Dododex. It‚Äôs helped me out drastically
How to tame? A fist and an iron will
Btw ark on vanilla is hard af when you‚Äôre new so feel free to tweak the settings to get used to the game. Faster takes, more exp, etc.
    *tames
That's at peggy. It gets tamed by stealing from you. I love those little guys there so skrungaly
Dododex app. It‚Äôll tell you how to tame anything and how long it‚Äôll take. The tips section will also help you learn how to deal with each creature
