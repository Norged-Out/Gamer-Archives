[[Fasolasuchus Taming is the worse taming design EVER!]]


Need other peoples opinions on this because imo Fasolasuchus is the worse designed taming method in Ark mainly due to how tedious it is to do, even with buffed taming rates, shit still takes forever even when you find a metal node or bones or salt rocks.

Trying to tame like a lvl 145 with 13k torp takes hours, how people have the patience to even attempt these tames on official blows my mind.

This method wouldn't be so bad if you didn't lose control after ever little rock or something you hit atleast that way you wouldn't get threw off as much.

Sorry, rant over ü§£


Just wait until the Shastasaurus comes out and you have to feed it metal foundations from your hotbar.
    Pretty sure for Shasta all we have to do is scrape off stuff from it's back. Atleast that's what the dossier says
        Megachelon but you are the fish school
            real
If they just increased the amount of torpor done with each hit it would be fine imo
    Wish they'd tie that amount to the taming rate of the server. Also, metal and salt nodes give more torpor afaik.
        Yeah I know but they still don't do that much
        Why would they tie the taming rate of a new dinosaur to the taming rate modifier? Wildcard are just new developers dude, give them a break! /s ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
            They aren't really a new dev anymore
            it‚Äôs not tied to taming rate just like how knocking out a creature with tranqs isn‚Äôt. Why would taming speed affect creature knockout and not creature resistance?
                Because in this specific case *it is the taming method*. Feeding it shit when its sleeping isnt the problem here.  
Everything else with a novel method has its speed increased by taming rates, so why tf not.
                    try dino resistance.
                I haven't tested it but it might be tied to dino damage resistance.

        can confirm this works amazingly
    I can imagine the server with increased lv cap and no one would just tame Fasolasuchus,ever
        Me, on a lvl 300 server, almost everyone has a max level one.
You have never experienced the amargs my friend
    God I don‚Äôt want to think about that. We have a few years before that fresh hell is unleashed on us again.
    Imo Amargasaurus is the shittiest they made so far
        Nah Shadowmanes and Megachelon or what ever the fuck its called are far worse. At least you can just trap the Amarga and do it pretty safely. The shadowmanes, even in a trap take forever, need fish in fucking baskets (So damned tedious to get big ones.) and half the time will decide "You know what fuck you, you lose all the taming process now for no reason. Get bent nerd."

Then there's the turtle cunts. Words can not describe how utterly asinine taming those things are. I refuse to believe Wildcard tested it themselves. And if they did, they're massive massochists and need help. It's just so god damned awful.
            If you're struggling with shadowmanes so much you're doing it wrong, they're incredibly easy to trap and feed through the walls, as for the megachelon i do agree it's quite bad.
                Yeah, no, I've tried a lot of different "Best shadomane traps."  It doesn't matter how, when, or where you feed them. Sometimes the game just says fuck you. I can feed one 10 times just fine, then on the 11th, while doing the exact same thing I had done the past 10 successful feeds, the game goes "Hmm nah its agro'd now. Fuck you."

It's genuinly just broken. They may have fixed it. I haven't played genesis, let alone Ark in a while. Either way, it at the very least used to be that way.
                    If you only played genesis when it first came out then yes, otherwise they are perfectly fine as far as i know, everyone i played with had no issues with them and i never heard of anyone else struggling with it.
        It doesn't help that the amargs really aren't even that good...so it makes their pain in the ass taming process that much worse
Try taming a rhyniognatha and hitting all of the cravings.
    I've done that for every one my tribe has. At least 90 of them. Usually 3-6 at a time. We made sure we had all the infrastructure to do cravings right next to the trap
        I have a trap with a stack of each craving prepped and ready to go. The PITA one is the golden egg one. I usually take a duck and go to gen 2 and hunt until I get bored.
            I'm on ASA. I have a gated section of river to throw my hespers out in
            How do you get golden egg? I have about 20 hesper's and nada
                I think they have to kill enough fish
                They have to hunt on their own and then they lay. Hard to set it up in an auto fashion. Would have to section off a pond or something and place oviraptors all around.
I used to think the same, my first one took me about 4-5 hours to just KO which was not worth it at all, but now theres some tutorials on youtube that makes it A LOT easier. If you go to the ARK Wiki and Scorched Earth and look at all the salt spawns in the dunes you can set a marker on the ones closest to the faso you are about to tame in a row, and just follow your markers. It went from taking 4-5 hours to KO one to 10-15 minutes to KO one! 

Not sure if this is allowed (Not my video, this is the one I used which was a lot more helpful than the ones people pumped out day one) https://youtu.be/_z9fgsYtNi4 This helped a ton for me and made it a lot easier :) 

Edit: He shows off the best method at about 3:10 in the video, really helps a lot:)
    See I've done the salt dunes, my problem is I keep getting thrown off when I hit a salt node at a weird angle, going off too high of a dune with throw me off, accidentally hitting a tree at a weird angle... throws me off.
        Yeah sometimes it bugs out when hitting some things too, happens a bit with salt nodes too where some runs are clean and some runs it just randomly kicks you off which can be a bit annoying. It also helps a little to have a friend with you if possible to clear out the wildlife around you if something goes wrong too! But yeah it can be really annoying, but found it to be a lot more reliable than searching for metal etc along the cliffs. 

What I did was just keep killing them around the area I had marked and waited for a decent one to spawn :)
        One thing I noticed is you gotta be careful with the water veins. They auto kick you off because they are counted as a structure or something. Those and the occasional note "ruin" that's actually just a small pillar
All they need to do is make the stupid things not kick you off from running over a stick
    Like dead dinosaur bodies or some bones or tiny desert houses.
I actually think its pretty good by design. The torpor is just too high so it gets tedious.

Shadowmane for example are way worse imo because one last screw up or something you cant control can fuck everything up
    Yeah they could double the torpor per salt node and I wouldn‚Äôt complain about the random kick offs and other struggles. It would be fun if it was a little more rewarding per hit. I just tamed my third about an hour ago and im officially over it and never want to do it again because of how unnecessarily difficult it is. Its just not as fun as it could be
        I mean, even if you get thrown off you dont ruin the tame because you just knock it and dont tame it yet. Thats why i think its a good method when adjusted to feel rewarding.
            Yeah i agree i dont think the need to change anything about it besides the abysmal amount of torpor they give you per node. I thought the Andrews in fjord were sort of tedious but they were still very fun. But yeah getting kicked off the faso for hitting a salt node at the wrong angle is such a kick in the nuts after barely gaining any torp beforehand
    Nah I‚Äôve tamed tons of shadowmane and trapping them makes it easy. The fasolo is awful because of how many things that can unpreventably go wrong during the taming process.
        Yeah but you dont loose any effectiveness
I dragged it up to the metal and bone clusters around the green ob and knocked out a 140 roughly 10 minutes
    i learned to tame mine there too, its actually fun to tame them now that i figured out a good method after a couple attempts and not giving up :)
I tried taming a 150 and started with the salt nodes until I ran out and switched to normal rocks. The Fasola kept throwing me off for unclear reasons and then aggroing to random wild babies which it couldn't kill without help, and there were like a dozen each time. After hours I had it to 11 of 13k torpor and then failed, because it aggroed to a whole mess of carnos and vultures and bled out. Failing after hours and hours just to tame a dinosaur of that tier is ridiculous. Shadowmanes feel like a vacation after that.
    I had this happen with one I was taming lol. Spent an hour on a 145 and when I knocked it down I was surrounded by at least 40-60  argies/vultures, was trying to kite them away and got to far and it spawned a carno inside the fas I was taming, every bird in the area started attacking it and the fas was the unfortunate victim of circumstance
Why the hell can't we just have another KO tame??? Is it too much to ask lol
Tried it once‚Ä¶ took me 20min for not even half of the topor bar. 
Then I force tamed this mf. 
Sometimes I think the devs don‚Äòt even play their own game.
    Absolutely they don't.

You know this when you try to tame 10-20 level 140+ dinos on official to get good stats to start breeding with.

Not only due spawn rates mean you have to "scout" over 2000 dinos to find your 10-20 level 140+ ones, but then you have to go through the taming process that many times.

There was a reason that they doubled taming speed a couple years after release to become the "new default", and CONSTANTLY run increased multiplier events.  Because vanilla 1x is double old vanilla, and STILL too slow for anyone who isn't playing 60+ hours/week.

I remember my first Bronto tame on the first server I played on.  14 hours.  I set alarms through the night so I could wake up, apply narcotics, make sure there were enough berries, and then go back to sleep.  Twice through the night.

Fuck that.

Every single dev should be forced to play solo on an official server.  And they take a 50% pay cut until they beat Gamma Overseer (not even alpha, we'll let them get by with Gamma!).

No help from anyone else.  It's really not that hard to clear all that content.  But the sheer quantity of boss-capable tames you have to do, and the breeding, to do that is HUGE.
I can confirm, it‚Äôs takes hourssss to tame a 150. Not only hours but you better stuff 20 c4/grenades in a tame out beside where you are trying to tame the Faso. You‚Äôll get knocked off a lot and the torpor doesn‚Äôt restart but god I‚Äôd rather jump off a bridge honestly. 

Also, if anyone brings up that salt rocks do more torpor, I‚Äôm gonna finally spontaneously combust.
It's an hour tops for a high level, if you aren't getting dismounted constantly. It's really not that bad at all. Here is my haul from over the week with the event, I got lucky and got one with 44 health and another with 41 stam. You don't really need melee for these guys but it is nice to have.

    Do you not see the problem in taking an entire hour to tame a single creature?
        Obviously I don't considering how many I have tamed on official, it's a very good tame and I don't think people have caught on to how useful they are. They have a raise time similar to a giga.
            It doesn't matter how useful it is. Taking an entire hour actively taming something is just fucking ridiculous.
                You guys clearly never played back when things used to take hours and hours (like the theri for example, when it came out there was no kibble for it and it was a 12+ hour tame)  an hour or two is nothing, if it really bothers you, you can always play on a custom/single player server.
                    So, just because it was worse, it means it can't be bad now? What the hell kind of logic is that?


Also, no, that's not how that works. You can have max taming speed, and it still won't affect the Falo because you increase its torpor by hitting it into rocks. Not its taming bar.
                        Dude you need to relax. Tbh your entire conversation with me has been a lot of you whining about the game mechanic, I think you need to just get gud, They are hard to tame for a reason. It's one of the FEW tames that takes time, and it's up there with Gigas, carchar, the bug, and  a couple others. It's way better than it used to be it's not even comparable so honestly you are talking out of your ass with the it was worse so it can be bad now argument.
The taming is fun. They just need to fix the god damn torpor applied per collision.
It's simple enough, it just takes absolutely forever. Wish the torpor scaled with taming speed.

I had my Argy follow me on distance 2 while I did it, on passive. When you get "thrown" if you don't touch WASD you stay on its back and can just look up for a pickup from your bird, as the Faso can't chomp you on its back.  Let it burrow again, then pop him back out.

Easily done with a grenade by the way. No need for C4.
Amargasaurus would like a word with you
It sucks even at higher taming rates cause taming doesn't affect that part. Riding him into things is building torpor, like shooting stuff with tranq arrows. Once you build the torpor and knock it out, then the boosted taming will help it tame faster. 

Sadly there doesn't seem to be any setting to make it easier. Even lowering wild torpor doesn't actually effect their torpor.
It's far easier with a second person flying as a spotter. They mark the next patch of rocks and then find the one after that
Couldn‚Äôt be worse than a troodon but I haven‚Äôt tried fasolasuchus yet
    Troodons you hust feed baby gigas too its a cake walk
amargasaurus enters the chat
I just got done taming my third and told myself ‚Äúthis is unnecessarily difficult and im not doing this ever again‚Äù and pulled out my phone and this was the first post i saw lol. 

Its just not as fun as it should be. It could be if the torpor per hit was doubled. I wouldn‚Äôt mind it at all if it would go up at least more than a millimeter per salt rock.
i think the taming method itself is ok it just takes way too long to give the thing torpor , id cut the amount of rocks it needs to hit in half or maybe even more , the creature is not even close to good enough to justify it being such a pain in the ass to tame
Clearly never tried taming a titanosaur solo with a quetzal
I had to give up on any high level ones, hell even level 30+ for my own sanity. Got a male and female so I‚Äôm breeding my way to higher levels
Taming rate dont change the torpor given. u can change the torpor on settings.
Nah, im sure reaper queen (still worth) and Megachelon are the most tedious. The first being hard as fuck and the latter being super buggy and very, very annoying.
Increased taming rates won't help you knock it out. That has nothing to do with torpor. Takes the same amount of time to ko on x1 you just don't need as much kibble. I agree. I spent 5 hours taming a 135 and just as I knocked it the server went down. I almost spent 5 hours knocking for nothing
I am on a boosted taming server (however it does not effect torpidity which is the process you are talking about) 

I have knocked out a 150 in about 20 minutes, 2 140s in about 30 and my first ever took me about a hour to figure out. It is not bad if you mark all salt nodes in the desert or look closely for little green dots on the map. (Mostly they‚Äôre salt, and bones work too)

All in all, yea this systems SUUUUCKS but once you do it a few times and get familiar with the desert it really isn‚Äôt bad at all. P.S. they‚Äôre bad ass tames üòú
I saw someone mention they were taming for over an hour on official, ended up needing the toilet, and struggled for a long while to hold it in so they could finish the tame. They had to run to the bathroom in the end, and lost the tame.

That's bad design.
They're easily done if you take them out into the dunes where all the salt spawns are. It still takes time and you may get buck a couple of times, but there are plenty of spawns out there to tame it. I did a 145 in roughly 20-30 mins.
Its not terrible if you know where to go it only takes me about 40 minutes to an hour to knock out a fasola granted the highest ive found was a 120 but still near blue ob in the deep desert there are plenty of salt rocks and bones to hit to get you at least 40%-50% of the way there then just head down towards green ob and keep doing the same thing. Still annoying to tame but not the worst lol
It‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôd rather not have only knockout and feed tames. They are more than fine, but variety is also good. Takes 2 hours or less, even on Official for a 150, if you know what you are doing. Just mark a lot of the ruins and salt locations on your map and track them. It‚Äôs easiest to do it in the NW part of the map moving counterclockwise. Stay somewhat closer inland in case you need to reset your control timer with a normal rock. 2 hours is still slightly steep, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too long or too short. That‚Äôs just on salt nodes. It‚Äôs way faster if you use locations with metal, obsidian, crystal etc. The salt method is just chiller and less chance of getting dismounted. I‚Äôd go with the latter.
Solo tamed a 140 on official 1x rates. Was fun and not that difficult. I have all my map markers in the north/ northwest desert marking salt and a few bones. Knocked off twice because it likes to bug out of the ground instead of destroying something sometimes. Had several grenades, canteens, and a shovel. If you get knocked off, start running to the next point whilst waiting for it to deagro and dig again. Torpor loss is very slow. Probs took 10-14 salt areas. Only salt and a bit of stone used. Honestly more fun than just sitting there and shooting something many times.
I think it‚Äôs probably a bad strategy you‚Äôre using because I‚Äôve tamed quite a few 140 to 150 fasos on official rates, the trick is to know where all the salt piles are beforehand and only go for those. Takes like 15-30 minutes to knock out a very high level one or max level one, if it kicks you off I just run away straight until it loses aggro and then repeat.
I gotta say taming one on official only using rocks was annoying even for a low level but I do like that the taming bar doesn't start over if it did that I'd probably never have one. They look awesome but seriously there moves are kinda a let down they don't seem useful on pve and idk how you would use them on pvp lol people could just run out of the circle before you get stunned and the tail whip is so weak might as well use a thorny dragon if you wanna do that.
I remember when it took 14 days to raise a baby wyvern on official with no cryos, I swear wild card hates players with jobs or lives outside of ark
There's a method of finding salt rocks out in the dunes nd pinging it and doing em in a row
I actually think it's a really good idea but badly executed small lil cliffs knocking you off and a horribly long knockout kills all the fun from getting one
Theyre immune to torpor so they will be badass manticore boss dinos. I just can't get any over level 75 to spawn to try and tame =[
I present the giant crab. Which doesn‚Äôt torpor via arrows or bullets, but by *fucking cannon fire only to its head*
Rates impact taming speed, not torpor gain.  Torpor gain is the issue, it needs to be buffed at least when hitting certain materials.
My game had a weird glitch where the first time taming it wouldn't burrow and walked like a 3rd around the map. Had to follow it for over an hour, ended up naming it the Proclaimer for walking 500 miles.
I was on one of those fucks for like an hour when it ramped over a rock instead of breaking it and kicked me off 
Biggest piss take I've had on ark
Idk, that gaint sea turtle is nuts. I never could tame it. The tut...gaint squid was crazy too, had to feed it my tames while I shoved black pearls down its mouth. Took me many tames and tries (f-in whale shark, lol)
Heard the Oasisaur is tough to tame too.
Ever since Gen1/2 every new tame has had some convoluted passive tame process.
I‚Äôm still yet to even see one spawn in
Cant belive people voted for this lame ass creature
Ehhh, I might take long, but it cant even begin to compare to amarg taming
I found that i can get a 150 knocked in about 30-40 minutes on x6 taming rates.  Planning your trip in the dunes focusing solely on salt is the way to go.  To try your best not to get knocked off you want to aim the crystal at the side of the faso's hitbox.
There's a reason to why imemersive taming was one of my most used mods on ase
i mean boosted taming rates won‚Äôt make it go unconscious faster because it‚Äôs not feeding when you‚Äôre running it into rocks you‚Äôre basically tranqing it
It's pretty easy imo, I play on 1x and it took me maybe half an hour to knock out a 140. The biggest problem was temperature.
Hmm. So, where are you taming this thing?

We've tamed several 120+, and 2 150s. 

We never left the desert. Even trying to hit nodes near the water nodes or structures is iffy and we avoided them. The last 2 we've tamed we've tried solo and its went okay, but we have a lot of salt marked in the area for us to go from one to the next. we also took ghillie, and cactus broth to reduce aggro if we got dismounted.

The longest it took us to tame one, the first time, was about 1.5hour.

The taming system is new, but if you follow a few rules to avoid being thrown off, such as staying in the desert at the very least, it's not that bad to tame them.

I wouldnt say its a skill issue, just that you werent using an effective method of taming.
It is I agree I spent 3 hours taming a 130 they need to up the torpor on rocks
Offical server taming pve hard as the dam areas filled with pillers or train tracks on my server, plus when knocked out been stuck underneath both times and lost effectiveness due to other Dinos hitting it trying to get at me
The taming method itself isn‚Äôt horrible. Just go get salt rocks in the dunes and follow nooblets. The real problem is the constant fucking heat waves and sand storms and the fasolo bucking you off every time you bump into ruins. I tried for 2 hours straight and got it to like 80% torpor then the torp reset. Fuck it I just forcetamed it at that point cuz it‚Äôs bullshit.
It‚Äôs a lot easier if you have a tribemate scouting out  bones/salt/metal/etc, I had a buddy fly on our phoenix and point out all of the nodes. It still took like, half an hour though
If there's anything to add at least there was a mod that was released not too long ago that makes it a but easier, a 140 took only twentyish minutes for me to down after 3 dismounts, just need to do a dino wipe before hand because it replaces the base fasalosuchus spawns with the mod's easier to tame ones
No i think its quite good for how OP the dino is.
Selling ark mobile amber accounts lmk
you should uninstall the game, clearly it's far too difficult for you
    Why is every response on here this? "I don't like x part of the game" "oh yea you should uninstall and leave the server"
        They probably tamed a lvl 5 and went ‚Äúthat wasnt so bad‚Äù lmao
Pretty sure for Shasta all we have to do is scrape off stuff from it's back. Atleast that's what the dossier says
    Megachelon but you are the fish school
        real
Wish they'd tie that amount to the taming rate of the server. Also, metal and salt nodes give more torpor afaik.
    Yeah I know but they still don't do that much

        They aren't really a new dev anymore
        it‚Äôs not tied to taming rate just like how knocking out a creature with tranqs isn‚Äôt. Why would taming speed affect creature knockout and not creature resistance?
            Because in this specific case *it is the taming method*. Feeding it shit when its sleeping isnt the problem here.  
Everything else with a novel method has its speed increased by taming rates, so why tf not.
                try dino resistance.
            I haven't tested it but it might be tied to dino damage resistance.

        I'm on ASA. I have a gated section of river to throw my hespers out in
        How do you get golden egg? I have about 20 hesper's and nada

    Yeah but you dont loose any effectiveness
i learned to tame mine there too, its actually fun to tame them now that i figured out a good method after a couple attempts and not giving up :)
I had this happen with one I was taming lol. Spent an hour on a 145 and when I knocked it down I was surrounded by at least 40-60  argies/vultures, was trying to kite them away and got to far and it spawned a carno inside the fas I was taming, every bird in the area started attacking it and the fas was the unfortunate victim of circumstance
Absolutely they don't.

You know this when you try to tame 10-20 level 140+ dinos on official to get good stats to start breeding with.

Not only due spawn rates mean you have to "scout" over 2000 dinos to find your 10-20 level 140+ ones, but then you have to go through the taming process that many times.

There was a reason that they doubled taming speed a couple years after release to become the "new default", and CONSTANTLY run increased multiplier events.  Because vanilla 1x is double old vanilla, and STILL too slow for anyone who isn't playing 60+ hours/week.

I remember my first Bronto tame on the first server I played on.  14 hours.  I set alarms through the night so I could wake up, apply narcotics, make sure there were enough berries, and then go back to sleep.  Twice through the night.

Fuck that.

Every single dev should be forced to play solo on an official server.  And they take a 50% pay cut until they beat Gamma Overseer (not even alpha, we'll let them get by with Gamma!).

No help from anyone else.  It's really not that hard to clear all that content.  But the sheer quantity of boss-capable tames you have to do, and the breeding, to do that is HUGE.
Do you not see the problem in taking an entire hour to tame a single creature?
    Obviously I don't considering how many I have tamed on official, it's a very good tame and I don't think people have caught on to how useful they are. They have a raise time similar to a giga.
        It doesn't matter how useful it is. Taking an entire hour actively taming something is just fucking ridiculous.
            You guys clearly never played back when things used to take hours and hours (like the theri for example, when it came out there was no kibble for it and it was a 12+ hour tame)  an hour or two is nothing, if it really bothers you, you can always play on a custom/single player server.
                So, just because it was worse, it means it can't be bad now? What the hell kind of logic is that?


Also, no, that's not how that works. You can have max taming speed, and it still won't affect the Falo because you increase its torpor by hitting it into rocks. Not its taming bar.
                    Dude you need to relax. Tbh your entire conversation with me has been a lot of you whining about the game mechanic, I think you need to just get gud, They are hard to tame for a reason. It's one of the FEW tames that takes time, and it's up there with Gigas, carchar, the bug, and  a couple others. It's way better than it used to be it's not even comparable so honestly you are talking out of your ass with the it was worse so it can be bad now argument.
Troodons you hust feed baby gigas too its a cake walk
Why is every response on here this? "I don't like x part of the game" "oh yea you should uninstall and leave the server"
    They probably tamed a lvl 5 and went ‚Äúthat wasnt so bad‚Äù lmao
Megachelon but you are the fish school
    real
Yeah I know but they still don't do that much
Why would they tie the taming rate of a new dinosaur to the taming rate modifier? Wildcard are just new developers dude, give them a break! /s ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    They aren't really a new dev anymore
    it‚Äôs not tied to taming rate just like how knocking out a creature with tranqs isn‚Äôt. Why would taming speed affect creature knockout and not creature resistance?
        Because in this specific case *it is the taming method*. Feeding it shit when its sleeping isnt the problem here.  
Everything else with a novel method has its speed increased by taming rates, so why tf not.
            try dino resistance.
        I haven't tested it but it might be tied to dino damage resistance.
can confirm this works amazingly
Me, on a lvl 300 server, almost everyone has a max level one.
Nah Shadowmanes and Megachelon or what ever the fuck its called are far worse. At least you can just trap the Amarga and do it pretty safely. The shadowmanes, even in a trap take forever, need fish in fucking baskets (So damned tedious to get big ones.) and half the time will decide "You know what fuck you, you lose all the taming process now for no reason. Get bent nerd."

Then there's the turtle cunts. Words can not describe how utterly asinine taming those things are. I refuse to believe Wildcard tested it themselves. And if they did, they're massive massochists and need help. It's just so god damned awful.
    If you're struggling with shadowmanes so much you're doing it wrong, they're incredibly easy to trap and feed through the walls, as for the megachelon i do agree it's quite bad.
        Yeah, no, I've tried a lot of different "Best shadomane traps."  It doesn't matter how, when, or where you feed them. Sometimes the game just says fuck you. I can feed one 10 times just fine, then on the 11th, while doing the exact same thing I had done the past 10 successful feeds, the game goes "Hmm nah its agro'd now. Fuck you."

It's genuinly just broken. They may have fixed it. I haven't played genesis, let alone Ark in a while. Either way, it at the very least used to be that way.
            If you only played genesis when it first came out then yes, otherwise they are perfectly fine as far as i know, everyone i played with had no issues with them and i never heard of anyone else struggling with it.
It doesn't help that the amargs really aren't even that good...so it makes their pain in the ass taming process that much worse
I have a trap with a stack of each craving prepped and ready to go. The PITA one is the golden egg one. I usually take a duck and go to gen 2 and hunt until I get bored.
    I'm on ASA. I have a gated section of river to throw my hespers out in
    How do you get golden egg? I have about 20 hesper's and nada
        I think they have to kill enough fish
        They have to hunt on their own and then they lay. Hard to set it up in an auto fashion. Would have to section off a pond or something and place oviraptors all around.
Yeah sometimes it bugs out when hitting some things too, happens a bit with salt nodes too where some runs are clean and some runs it just randomly kicks you off which can be a bit annoying. It also helps a little to have a friend with you if possible to clear out the wildlife around you if something goes wrong too! But yeah it can be really annoying, but found it to be a lot more reliable than searching for metal etc along the cliffs. 

What I did was just keep killing them around the area I had marked and waited for a decent one to spawn :)
One thing I noticed is you gotta be careful with the water veins. They auto kick you off because they are counted as a structure or something. Those and the occasional note "ruin" that's actually just a small pillar
I mean, even if you get thrown off you dont ruin the tame because you just knock it and dont tame it yet. Thats why i think its a good method when adjusted to feel rewarding.
    Yeah i agree i dont think the need to change anything about it besides the abysmal amount of torpor they give you per node. I thought the Andrews in fjord were sort of tedious but they were still very fun. But yeah getting kicked off the faso for hitting a salt node at the wrong angle is such a kick in the nuts after barely gaining any torp beforehand
Yeah but you dont loose any effectiveness
