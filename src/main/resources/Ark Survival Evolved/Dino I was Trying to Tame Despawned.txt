[[Dino I was Trying to Tame Despawned]]


I was with my friends shooting at this giganotosaurus on the map Extincion and it suddenly despawned in this clip, any ideas or reasons why this happened? Help would be appreciated thank you! 


Get ark'd
    Classic
He was just meshing around
    If i could give you an award i would
    lmao
I think it walked onto a place where it shouldn't have been able to walk so the game freaked out and zaped em
    Yeah I think it jumped into the cliff edge, got considered as being in mesh and deleted
[deleted]
    No sadly, we looked around the area and he was completely and around the area whwre he usually spawns :(
I think it clipped inside of the rock and was garbage collected.
It usuallt goes under mesh. use K mode to check.
    You do realize he's clearly playing on an Xbox with his quick actions on the bottom let alone you're assuming he's playing single player where he'd be allowed to look. Multi-player he'd only be able to orbit cam and still wouldn't see it because it meshed and got deleted.
    >It usuallt goes under mesh. use K mode to check.

Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, he's playing MULTIPLAYER on XBOX. He has no access to that.
        isnâ€™t k mode just orbital cam or am I stupid
            He's on XBOX he doesn't have the K button.   


Xbox you DO have orbital camera apparently but  


Hold down the back button

  
Use the stick to select the orbital camera
Trust me, ARK did you a favor.  Those Carnies die way too easy.
    Itâ€™s a Giga lol.
        Gigas die faster than anything else.
        gigas die even faster
        so? Itâ€™s a carnivore isnâ€™t it
It clipped into the mesh which deletes stuff.
Just Ark things
bro rage quitted
Blink and you'll miss him.
It went straight back into it's pokeball
The Ark giveth, and the Ark taketh. Usually the Ark taketh.
    The ark hath given me 2 lvl 292 lightning wyver eggs,  of opposite genders, it shall never taketh this away from me
        Famous last words...
            Yeah i losg my female while on extinction cause i wasnt payng attention and flying in the wastelands... now i only have 3 males, cause i lost citrus as well do to a bug when transfering servers. The ark hath taketh away... i also set up a grave system after that since those were the first creatures, plus a thyla lost with citrus, that i was actually attatched to this playthrough. Actually i think those were some of the first i did lose
Thatâ€™s ark for ya
He said your mother was a squirrel and your father smelled of elderberries
    Hamster, his mother was a hamster

Edit: it means his mom is a slut and his dad is a drunk
Welcome to Ark my friend!
The dino found the backrooms
Lol
Itâ€™s because ARK is fucking bad
Did u go over there it might of just rendered out of view
Render distance maybe
The dino:

Fairly normal ark experience tbf
Brainworms got him
Maybe an internet issue?
Welcome to ark
My bad I got hungry
Ark gonna Ark.
He just activated his cloaking field
Paid roughly $40 for them to take steps backwards in development, for a minor graphics upgrade. They brought back bugs that were fixed before, and nuked all the current official servers so anyone who still had stuff on there lost everything and has to pay to start over from scratch.
Lol what... Did you think you were playing a finished game or something? You will pay retail price twice and you will like it!
If you're on a server, it could've been a dino wipe
Went out of render range? Go get em.
Giga's have a bad habit of doing this, ive seen it three times myself now, and been accused of wiping dinosaurs while my servers players were trying to tame one like twice now.
Ahhh first time?? ðŸ« 
The way you just looked around for it made me chuckle
Why not just trap it? Gigas are too hard to just flat tame and there's no guarantee that they don't just run off and despawn anyways.

Essentially, if a dino goes out of render distance OUTSIDE of it's spawn container, it will despawn. If it's inside the spawn container, it will pop back up when you go near.

Frustrating, but a lesson to be learned. At least Extinction has the easiest giga farm run in the game. Just run up along the west side of the snow biome and kill everything that normally spawns in the wasteland. Eventually a giga will pop up assuming there isn't one already.

What is that sight picture lol
itâ€™s always the gigas, too. i hate it
Looked like a wilddino wipe command to me.
Solo taming a giga without a trap be like
Me and my boy was playin ark while we were trying to tame up a max lvl Stego in the early game. So we knocked it out and let itâ€™s food deplete since you donâ€™t need narcs using crops, we needed to wait a little over an hour for it to be ready so we ran back to base to burn some time. Whenever it was time to go back to the tame and put my crops in the stego completely despawned and was no longer on the ground unconsciousâ€¦
