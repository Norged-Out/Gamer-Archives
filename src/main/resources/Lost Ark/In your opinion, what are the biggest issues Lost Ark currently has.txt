[[In your opinion, what are the biggest issues Lost Ark currently has]]


I have my own issues with the game, but after speaking to few of my friends, who recently quit and few who still play, they all had different things to say about the game and why they quit or why they still play, so I'm kinda curious to what other people think about biggest issues currently in the game.


Too much homework.
    Indeed, the game just takes too much damn time that they should rename it Lost Life.

Some changes that would be good is combining chaos dung and guardian raids like cube and boss rush. They have you fight guardians on a huge map which is hardly used for anything besides running to guardian. they might as well add some mobs in it and have us do both at same time while also just reducing it to 1 time a day per character. Also guardians should have a chance to be dropped as mount in all honestly since some of them would be sick as mounts, but doubt they ever do that.

Another change is to legion raids that would just have you do highest ilvl raid you can do for gold. All you'd have to do in our current version is Brel for each character at i490+ and it just gives you x3 gold which would reduce time spent raiding. It makes no sense having high ilvl characters having to go back to do old raids that they sweep through like a chore besides time sink. If they are worried about gold inflation just have it where the box cost 3x gold as well as giving x3 resources. KR also has it where they aren't locked into doing only 3 legion raids a week so you can still go back and do old ones for cards or to help a friend out if need be.

Some small changes that would help out is automatically doing log in check for guilds for each character I log into while getting the highest reward for each quest for guild. Same with una tasks just accept the 3 unas I did prior day on that character so I can just go about business a little fast.

Personally, I hope this year they look into reducing time spent on the game and realize it's not healthy for players. It doesn't have to be these changes, but hope we get some before even more players quit cause of it.
        They straight up reject the idea of reducing chaos and guardians raid to 1/day already. Merging the 2 would be the most interesting option, but there’s no chance they will do it. Smilegate just doubles down on keeping player doing repetitive homework.
            Yeah, and it's causing the game to die. The amount of zero effort braindead content this game makes you do purely to generate currency and keep up with market prices is crazy.

It's legit like clocking in on a factory assembly line job just to pay bills. Hard to keep people playing who actually have a real job already.

I sometimes convert item cost into legion raid gold rewards. Like "huh, this 87 quality ring costs 10 Vykas..." - it's messed up once you consider the time spent on farming the gold. Unless you deeply enjoy the content even after 50+ repeats it's just a bad time that's also paid very badly.
                Korean games never change their mind b4 playerbase goes to shit. 

 Just look at KR with how they treat new players and Card set gatekeeping? 1490 express when current content is 1600+ and a scuffed LoS clone instead of making LoS 18 baseline or reworking cards completly. Ontop of being too greedy to give new players 5x3 for 2-3 months. 4x3 no LoS 20 roster ppl surely gonna get into brels. No rewards to help new players in raids etc.
                    Yeah. It's a shame bc this game has such an amazing foundational setup of controls, art style and gameplay mechanics.

It's just so bogged down by legacy system clutter, upgrade system inflation and stubborn anti-player grind.

And on top, the grind for currency lacks sufficient break points, so new players at entry ilvl have to compete for party spots against established endgame players and their armada of alts.
                        The inflation part of upgrading is slowly killing my desire to continue even though i mostly enjoy the game. I'm only honing one brel character while generating mats from 4  characters regularly and its still not enough. Then we also have to generate mats for fuzion material while also spending gold to craft it. Why does it cost gold to craft something on top of the activity energy? The inflated cost of upgrading a character encourages RMT.
                        Anti-player while simultaneously being pro-revenue generating 🤣
                            The top 10% probably spends more than the remaining 90%.
                            Do you truly think that’s a contradiction? If so, you learned nothing from Diablo Immortal and all the other games that prioritize their monetization over longevity and offered quality. Lost Ark makes more money by squeezing idiots dry who drop the game soon afterwards than by cultivating a long term low spending player base.

So yeah, it is often very much anti player to be pro maximized revenue. Hell, it almost always is.
                    I was always curious whether KR had a gatekeeping problem also, I guess it's just a problem of the game.. but they should figure out a way to get people to wanna help new players with some kind of reward or what not.
                Yeah and for people that have jobs you quickly realize you can buy 50k gold for 15 bucks.. just demotivates you even more to do homework. If I really liked the raids I’d log in to do those then buy 50k gold a week to keep up with progression. Boom just solved the time issue with lost ark.
            Its a calculated biz decision, if they give you those QOL changes, certainly they know ppl will not fury/frustrated swipe. The whole game is working on player mental, they want to infuriate player to swipe anyway possible.
            They did say that the amount of “chores” is what they feel to be the minimum level of effort in the last LOA-on
                If they actually were forced to play their own game I bet they would change their mind.
            Honestly after returning to the game in Nov, I'm ready to stop again. Raids are fun the first few times, but get boring after you do them even 3 or 4 times a week for multiple weeks.
            I like doing all of my chaos dungeons and guardian raids. I wish I had more stuff to do because I’m done in the first hour I play 🤷 I only have 3 characters rn
                Then create more characters

&#x200B;

Why are you for more homework ?
                    Why so I can get burnt out and complain like everyone in this thread? Lol I will be soon with express pass. I like doing all of the daily stuff there’s nothing wrong with me enjoying it. You don’t HAVE to do it. You also get rested bonus…
            Players double down on doing it. You don't have to
                This attitude about content makes players realize their time is being wasted, though. The reward in proportion to time spent is just too low.

And once people realize this, they are just one step away from quitting.
                    the biggest lost ark lie told by streamers: "Lost ark respects your time"
        >All you'd have to do in our current version is Brel for each character at i490+ and it just gives you x3 gold

Better yet remove 3 of the 6 gates.They realized its a bad idea and corrected it with akkan.

Gate 6 is a waiting game too which sucks balls when you're over geared.
        > realize it's not healthy for players

lol. they KNOW it's not healthy for players and are very much aware of the minimum time investment to get a return on the game. as i and many people have said from the beginning, the game is designed from the ground up to extract as much time and investment from players as possible. thinking they dont realize or dont know is very naive.
        Yeah I hate the idea that I still am compelled to run Valtan/Vykas. Like please I've done hundreds of times now i'm so bored of them BUT I CANT STOP BECAUSE THEY GIVE SO MUCH GOLD A WEEK.
        i agree with u on most points , except doing old raids , if u dont give intensive to do older raids will be abondoned . and other players will not be able to enjoy it , hence gatekeeping
    reddit's anti-user changes are unacceptable
    Yep

1) There's too much to do and not enough time to do it w/o sacrificing large parts of your real life. Every wipe in a homework raid is another few minutes of your time gone and further extending the amount of time you need to clear everything. Now, you don't "need" to clear everything but not doing so means you're most likely leaving gold on the table which leads me into my next point:

2) Too much focus around market simulator and not enough on actually playing the game. The game revolves around gold too heavily. Everything takes gold and the more progress you make, the more gold you need to sustain it all. The more progress you make the more silver you need which leads back to point #1 about homework. Sure you can do everything rested, but a) you still have to do it eventually and b) you're leaving loot on the table (i.e. silver which is needed in ludicrous amounts). Both points 1 and 2 then leads to:

3) Gatekeeping. You're short on time and you've got gold you still need to earn. All these raids requires you to pass Gate 0: the Party Finder. You can start your own raid but if you're near on-ilvl, doubtful many will want to join your party. The next gate you need to pass is 0.5: Finding supports so your raid can start. Once the raid starts, you have to hope that things go smooth and nobody is an imposter. Wiping once or twice due to bad luck is understandable. Wiping repeatedly at the same mech means your time has been wasted and you're probably back to the party finder. Not the worst if it was a DPS imposter. Fairly bad if it was a support imposter because now you're back to waiting for a support to try again. Whats the solution for the average person? Over-hone your toon so it looks more attractive. Get it 5x3 or better. What does all of that take? Points 1 and 2.

Bottomline, it's a vicious cycle of corporate greed trying to get people to swipe which leads to each point returning upon itself.
        I don't think someone summarized it any better than this
It's all calculated to make the most profit out of player's misery, and people believing That they will change that to " accommodate" us are on copium, sadly, (but I understand them)
    I agree, and I only play 3 characters, 1475, 1460 and 1430. I do everything on rested but I am so fed up with wasting hours doing something with 0 risk reward, and then wasting hours looking for raids with other burned out people who are probably way more burned out than myself taking 1500s over me, and I don't blame them, because it's a symptom of the burnout and fomo and the daily and weekly repetitive homework is the root imo.
        I recently started the Witcher 3. It's like a breath of fresh air.  Looking forward to Blue Protocol and Diablo 4.

Some things I'm looking for in my next long term game: (1) near simultaneous content release {within 1 week allowing for different patch days}. (2) amount of daily/weekly required activities. (3) how much time do I spend looking at a loading screen.
            Me too actually, Witcher 3 is one of my all time favorites and I finally recently upgraded to a PC that game run the HD update pretty well.  A friend of mine got me to try Albion online and I'm liking it so far but not sure how much of a time commitment it is later on.
                Albione online is great. Played it for a long time.

The good thing about albion is that there is no time commitment unless you do zvz. And zvz is kinda meh, i never liked it.

So unless you do zvz, hell - you can just do whatever u want and whenever u want.

No dailies, no weeklies, nothing you " have " to do.

The only issue with the game is that when ur veteran, you dont have much to do. Its when u like level up everything u need, when ur so rich that loot doesnt really mean anything like it used to - eh.

I had lot of fun with the game. The potential for epic moments in it is high, especially if you play solo and if you use the game mechanics against others. Used to make some vids here and there - here one funny moment of baiting people :D [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpSYykrEQzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpSYykrEQzQ)
                    hooly shitoe haha that looks fun. I'm actually great with that kind of expiration date, end-game in mmos is overrated.
    I feel like the load time only makes this worse. Want to drop in for a quick chaos dungeon? Make sure you have at least 10 minutes for the game to load. After you're in the game, you need to load your character, and then load into the chaos dungeons as well. With an additional loading screen between the two dungeons. Then the loading screen when you're done with the second dungeon.
    Exactly this. God forbid gamers have a life or want to try other games zzzz - I get they want people to keep player login count high, but ffs relax
    The true asnwer. Others mention gatekeeping but gatekeeping is just a side effect of too much homework. Too much homework is the root of many issues in this game, gatekeeping included
        No it's the other way around. There is a lot of homework, but you can choose how much of it to do. The problem is there is pressure to do *all* your homework to keep up with gatekeeping standards so you can actually do fun content. If all kinds of players (hardcore, casual, anything in between) could fill their own parties without affecting each other I don't see a problem. But casual lobbies don't exist because all the supports go to juicer/hardcore lobbies. So I'm pretty sure support shortage is the root of the problem here.

Eliminating homework would just turn this game into a different kind of game, the kind that intentionally limits your grinding ability so no players can normally get far ahead (unless you swipe), and that's how they artificially keep the even ground. But that's a backwards way to go about solving the problem.
            I agree with you in that its gatekeeping that is the problem of pressure to do all the homework to keep up but disagree the root. The root of why gatekeeping exists is b/c they allow such a vast power differential between players who queue for the same activity. Match making in games that offer equalized / standardized characters doesn't face this same issue.

If Ilevel was used strictly to gain accesss to content and character systems were adjusted to give slight benefits. Gatekeeping would almost disappear because waiting for 5 minutes for someone who has slightly higher damage reduction/output no longer is worth the time cost. Along with a complete removal of a players ability to outgear content.
                Gatekeeping is the same as getting solar stuff and books in improving honing RNG, becuz it has no pity system, a group can fail infinitely etc. Higher ilevel/item =/= automatic clear but rather like a RNG boost in honing, it reduce the chance of failure.
         Homeworks are mat gating. Gatekeeping is essential to money making for the company, it pressures ppl to swipe in order to catchup.
    I only raid with my main and after doing Brel G1 to G6 I just don't want to play for the rest of the day...
        I did brel 1-6 on my main last week and logged off for the week lol..
            Hahaha yeah I feel you, the game has started to feel more like a chore than anything else. 

I recently started playing Deep Rock Galactic and it's just been refreshing.
                I’ve been playing Sons of the Forest and valorant.
                    Recently went back to eldenring ring. Lost ark is.
        Never done 5-6 brel, and don't feel like doing them cause doing 1-4 on 2 characters drains me for the whole week.
            Never seen 6 because the prog groups I've been in have abandoned in 5 pretty quickly.

                [deleted]
                    Sounds like an user problem.
    This, 

I find most enjoyment in doing inferno mode, but if I want to also progress my character at a reasonable pace, it's either i do all my homework, which is boring, or do inferno and have fun. It's been a couple weeks now where I just skip doing dailies for the entire day on the days I run inferno.  5/6 of my chars have been full rested for a while now and it's the best balance i can do
    I left due to too much FOMO.  I was doing only rested on all of my characters, but every reset night, I'd feel like I'd have to play for hours and hours and hours to complete every raid that I have on my 6 man 1460-1520 roster.    


Taking 10 minutes to log in (maybe not literally, but you know), so I can get my daily login bonus.  Just way too much FOMO.  I realized I was logging in just so I didn't fall behind.  I wasn't actually having fun doing dailies (especially una dailies).
    Silver forces you to create alts imo.
        That's part of it. I actually like alts as most of the classes in this game are satisfying to play. My gripe is I'm starting to hate gearing them up because of abyssmal drops on accessories. Across 16 characters, i've probably got 3 very average drops that i'm currently using. Evertything else has had to be purchased off market/AH which also comes with the pheon tax.
    Agree. They could at least utilise the rest bonus system to make 1 CD/Guardians spend all 100/100 rest bonus. It will become more like weekly stuff and players would get 50% rewards .
    Every raid feels like homework now. Valtan, clown, vykas and Brel(1-6) feel like a chore to do.
    The solution is to take alts and connect/tie to main and if main completes content (i.e., chaos dungeon, raids, etc) it should also complete on the connected alt.
    Reminder that the homework keeps you from enjoying the rest of the game or helping your fellow players. Too much time spent trying to break from brel prison and clown (or so I hear, I'm not that far).
        "homework" IS the rest of the game.  
The game also pays you to do that "homework" so you can go back and help your fellow players with a good reason to do old content.
    Currently hit burnout and took a week break. Spent all my gold on master summoner books and now know I have to farm a shit ton of gold for spec accessories that will be outdated in a month. 

My will to play is low right now (probably my fault for having 6 characters over 1490 not 1590). But I can't even be half assed at finishing the Brel title since there's just too many time sucks to get trapped in 5 for an hour.
        Relic accessories aren't outdated even in KR. Ancient accessories are a very minor upgrade over relic for their price.
            1 level of engravings (if you replace all 5 +3/+5 relics with +3/+6 ancient) and a little bit of STR/DEX/INT isn’t really a lot. Ancients don’t even give increased stats of crit/spec/swift. We will be good with relics for quite a long time
        U can go over 1590 o.o?
            Meant 1490 haha.
                Hahhahah mine all over 1520 but i only play 5 char and if i got time i do weekly on 6th one, and yeah getting title help a lot and its the diff betweeen 1 hour bre and 5 hour bre. It also help i got 2 sup which dont need much invest yet so i can pump everytjing into my dps.
        >now know I have to farm a shit ton of gold for spec accessories that will be outdated in a month.

Here is the neat thing: You actually DON'T know. Relic accessories are VERY much still relevant in KR. :)
    This will never change lol the only way not to do hw is to swip and that's how they get revenue

They dont want to make it easier for f2p ppl. They need whales
    yep. doing the same guardian 12 times a day is so fucking boring.

i only do my chores with rested and i'm getting sick of this game. can't wait for new POE season and new games
    Chaos Dungeons, Guardian Raids, Daily Unas, Guild Tasks, Chaos Gates, Field Bosses, Adventure Island, Stronghold/Life Energy, Cube, Boss Rush, Weekly Unas, Challenge Guardian Raids, Challenge Abyssal Dungeons, Pirate Ship, Legion Raids 3x6, Rowen Weeklies (Happy Anniversary!) and of course, Limited-time Events! That's not including extra credit like Bussing, Guild Events, PvP, or going through that stack of Platinum Field Tickets!
    Bump
    This is just such a stupid take. YOU are the one doing 12 character on 1500+ and having heavily FOMO issues, SG nor AGS is forcing you to do that. I play fucking 4 chars and one of them is 1500+ and I have zero problems to keep up with others even my friend which plays lesser chars stopped for a while playing lost ark and started now again a few week ago and I dont know if he is a wizard but he is close to my GS and I haven’t stopped playing.
        The game does not even give you enough silver to hone if you just have one main.  And as you hone the alts you dig yourself into a deeper hole.  It's absolutely by the game's design.
            The fuck am i reading? Then you and many other do definitly something wrong. My main is 1560 with 1x 1460 1x 1445 and 1x 1415 im sitting on close to 120m silver and 1,17m raw gold + over 500 L Shard Bags. And I haven’t even spent money dunno what u guys do wrong especially those who swipe too.
                You have four characters? l2read and stop being so madge?
                    Yes and I did my first alt when my main was around 1490 out of boredom even without them I would have more than enough silver. Then you should stop spreading missinformation and quit the game or learn how to spend your recourses or stop getting catched by FOMO. If you want everything in a week like many of the other whiny guys here then play a shooter or smth but not a MMO.
    Yea I quit last week as I just could not do anymore chaos/guardians/boss rush/cube. I did brel 1 to 6 and felt like ok nothing else coming. Best to quit now as I cannot see myself doing hw just to go up a few ilvls for brel hm or akkan.
    Just to get the bossrush tickets, I ended up having 21 characters and yes, burnt out by myself.

But the community affected me as well. I'm having a high roster of 234 so far by just doing tower, daily, weekly stuff, recently did learn Valtan but not vykas.   
Community wise being mocked for having high roster and still wanting to learn the fight because how dare I not being an expert and not cheating into reclear groups because I don't want to hinder them to progress.  


So I was looking for a guild. "Don't burn out yourself, just play like you feel like it" 2 hours later "omg people we should clear brel g2 finally, we've been trying since two weeks, you should be willing to spend 6 hours a day 3-4 days a week so we can finally progress. Oh, and you. You didn't do Vykas, Clown and Brel so far, so prepare for Vykas mechs, learn clown mechs and do the marios in perfection. What? You didn't have the time to learn prokel? How dare you?

And the explanations. "We are running down, to the left over the outside to the inside, straight back  up, in an ellipse straight to the middle and back to the left where we run to the right again" one fail after "mimimi why didn't you do what I just said" sorry? Was trying to follow but honestly, that explanation was terrible.  


Valtan wise with randoms was finishing me off. So many groups where supports are dying first by falling off the map going on a insulting rampage when others were dying in ghost phase and quit spamming after the first wipe and so on. 

I just quit raiding by myself and just buy carrieruns now. Much less troubles, less insultings and I am having fun again. Not doing all the homework and just play how I feel like it.

But one big issue is honing as well. And don't get me started with tripods, when you fail 15 times the 25% chance in a row. I feel like the displayed chance doesn't match the actual chance, even if it might be correct. But RNG just hates me.
Too much dailies. Also the way new players get introduced to raids is terrible. They are pretty much forced to pay to watch someone do the content for them until they overgear it.
    Right now I'm 1560 and I've really enjoyed the game, but if I was just starting the game and someone recommended me to pay for a bus, I would have quit right away.
        Yeah I was amazed when ATK was talking about how he recommended his friend to take a bus. Like bruv you play 200 chars and won´t even help a brother out? Can´t imagine any1 sticking around if they aren´t into it or have friends helping
            Yeah I was playing with a friend and I would not raid with my Paladin to raid only with him to make it easier for him to get accepted, because I've been in that spot sometimes that my friends would just go "Oh just get to X level by yourself" then why am I even bothering playing the game if I'm going to play by myself?

He still quit because he didn't enjoy how the legion raids work (weekly homework).
                That's basically where I'm at. The weekly homework doesn't feel great after beating it so many times. It was fun beating valtan close to ilvl, but now it's just boring, and you end up spending more time in PF because people still gate keep.
        This is why I left my last guild
Gatekeeping - we want more new players, but won’t play with new players
    Exactly the issue I‘m facing as returning player with only 1380
    Someone said homework above. Gatekeeping is in part due to how much homework there is. Your time is limited because of the homework which makes gatekeeping almost required to complete content quickly enough.

Weekly and daily content required to complete in order to keep up, at least in my opinion, is one of the largest contributors to gatekeeping.
        In my opinion learning parties are inpractical bc of lock outs. I have plenty of time, but hosting a learning party is a huge time commitment and I'd rather just join and help out for about an hour and not deal with being stuck on gate 2 if the group disbands. 

Let us repeat raids and do something about bussing game would be way better.
            Bussing is interesting. Its value is huge, you can double your gold intake by bussing. The problem is that it essentially ruins the new player experience completely.

I’m not against bussing but I also think that its gotten out of hand, as well, which has also contributed to gatekeeping.
                I ran Argos bus the other day, and one of the passengers was a 1370 mokoko bard with an okay build, and she played with us doing normal bard stuff and did the mechanics too. So sad that she had to pay 1500g for the privilege of just doing the raid normally as a new player. And "funny" thing is that she was lucky to not get gatekept from even joining the bus, some drivers I ran with refused to take mokokos because they don't know how to use AH (fair enough).
                    Isn’t there also a trusted status restriction on the AH? So it is reasonable to think that a mokoko player wouldn’t have a trusted account. So they may know how to use AH but can’t? This is what I have heard, I don’t keep track of these things though.
                Well I'm in the opinion that buses are fine (I bus from time to time). I just want unlimited entries for raids cuz I want to do them when I'm bored. I don't want lock outs. 

But unlimited entries= unlimited buses so that's what they'll have to tackle. Or tbh if it's unlimited entry there might be too much competition for bussing and prices would be down?
                    Heck, some players might just start joining old raids for fun or even carrying friends or guildies if they could run the same raid multiple times on the same character. People freak out about unlimited runs = unlimited busses, but it really weakens the power of a busser when other people can just fill that slot.
                    >But unlimited entries= unlimited buses so that's what they'll have to tackle. Or tbh if it's unlimited entry there might be too much competition for bussing and prices would be down?

Unlimited busses capitulates on itself. Prices would become extremely low and filling a bus would take even longer than it does now because of how many other lobbies there would be.
                    No lockout are coming in the next KR update right? So next year you’ll have no lockouts lol
                        No there's still lock outs lol. They just removed the 3 legion raids limiter. You can still only enter valtan once per week with one character.
                    Final fantasy ran into this issue and aside from their content being _usually_ harder to bus for large numbers, what it simply does is make the reward structure go like this:

- If you clear with all 8 players new to the raid or haven't consumed their weekly lockout, 2 chests of loot.

- if 1-4 player has already cleared this week, only 1 chest drops.

- If 5-8 players have already cleared, no chest drops.

You can just do your own 2 chest run as a seasoned player then simply join a friend in a learning or prog party, they'll get 1 chest or zero chest, but clearing the raid gives a guaranteed drop which counts towards their gear progression. The chests are more akin to the box we buy after raid clear from the side menu in lost ark.

Would people be against getting a vykas clear if it only meant they don't get to buy the chest and double their wings? I think a lot of people would be, and it's a shame that Lost Ark's answer isn't to strike a middle ground but rather just declare open warfare against the idea of player choice repetition.
            \+10000 learning party means that you risk that your character won't finish the raid at that week and you lose gold. you sacrifice your own resources to teach someone. they put a design to reduces buses and in return make the learning partis way more difficult. 

I wouldn't mind join learning party on character I already did the clear with and just joining for help but this is not the case
            Just give people ability to run more legion raids without lock out, but you get very little in loot and your character is lowered to lowest ilevel requirements so no bus
        They can introduce extra rewards for having a mokoko in your raid, and that’ll be solved
            Don't worry I'll take that juicy compensation as I boost my good mokoko friends sjsjsggsv and kdkfllflf
                They’re already getting boosted, its irrelevant.
                    but now other will be incentivised to boost too with that compensation. yum yum
                        The bots are already paying really well, people who dont care are already incentivized.

You’re willfully ignoring that this allows many mokokos to actually get to play the game, be helped and feel like part of the community, your “worries” are already happening.
            Good idea and they give mokoko status to players who haven't played for a month or two months
            Depending on the raid, time to complete with someone you have to teach or carry, etc. The gold value is anywhere between 4,500 to 8,000. Unless there is a way to compensate based on time spent in a raid with a mokoko and reward based on how far above the average completion time it is, it isn’t feasible. 

I’m not advocating for gatekeeping. I just don’t think any rewards they would be willing to add, would deter a lot of people. Especially when you consider new raid tiers, new soft reset gear. That Vykas with a mokoko could cause so much time to lapse a persons alt might not get a Brel clear because that person only has 2-3 hours on that Sunday. This is essentially allowing a mokoko to grief someone elses roster progression because of time jailge.

Unfortunately, that is how the game is inherently designed.
    Honestly, this, which leads into another topic: the shitty elitist player base. 

They're a small fraction of the community, but man are they loud as fuck.
    as someone that recently came back, the constant quitting before even giving an attempt in matchmaker is really maddening.
        Just a quick advice, never run content through matchmaking except maybe abyssal dungeons. You will get matched with people who juat wanna be carried, and they will usually ask to quit dungeon as soon as they say there is no juiced character in the party.
            My problem right now (just hit 1400ilvl) is that matchmaking groups usually can't clear, and pf groups are either busses or reject my applications, wanting higher ilvl.
                Stick to yoho, trust me.
                    Not sure what you mean
                    Deska is way easier and I get much better teammates too. When I was doing yoho we would constantly fail. Fuck that
                        ...you can't do deskaluda at 1400. Velganos is cancer in a pug setting. So stick to Yoho until 1415.
            yah, I'm getting the picture. so cancerous
            i actually had a 1490 in my party that did less damage than my 1410. Ended up carrying them. They were fully maxed on Argos gear (no valtan or vykas relic) so I assume it was one of the early whale swipers.
    The game design punishes you for helping each other. Got another 5+ characters of raids, then card runs, then islands, and don't forget the time to do stuff you want in or out of the game. And when you fail a raid it costs money to get more supplies to go again.
    This is largely due to how difficult it is to gear up to the communities standards.

It's pretty bad in WoW as well for the same reasons.

A game like FFXIV where day 1 of raiding you can be raid ready extremely quickly and has hard ilvl caps on current content has very little gatekeeping because the only thing to consider is player skill as the gear is basically a non-issue and class balance is ridiculously good.

Going from a 4x3 to a 5x3 in Lost Ark especially for newer players that don't already have grudge or another leg book is insanely expensive. Then you still need to hone well above what is required for the raid to be accepted. It's just bad game design at the end of the day. Nobody should be trying to follow WoW's model of designing a game based on toxicity.
    Preach, teach new players how to play the game and the content so they can teach others further down the line
    I´d spend 3x the time in a raid helping a new person if I could get 3x the amount of my raids done.

Or just in general let me q 6x clown for my roster on the same char. 

idk give me options.
        nah. double or triple the gold earned from raids and reduce gold earning characters proportionally.

sg will never tho. they want us to grind and when we get sick of the grind it incentives spending real money to skip the grind. converting f2p into p2p is the endgame for sg and let be honest that shit works so well.

also reducing gold earning characters and boosting gold per raid will never fly because building characters also generates profits for them.  the game is designed to min max profits
    Bump
    The game is forcing you to gatekeep others because there is too much homework in this game. 

You dont have time to help others because you have so much to do and your time is limited. Its the game's fault.
    [deleted]
        There aren't many learning lobbies. It's not that deep, my guy.

Sure, there's some that want a free carry, but these are mostly not new players. New players tend to still be enamored of the game, have less homework, and want to actually experience the raid.

Even on ilvl parties gatekeep.
    This
    I felt that one brother I did my first vykas and I did pretty good on studying it but the one thing I didn't look at was calling in or out after blue black orbs and got flamed for wasting people's time and that I should join a learning party so I made a learning party went 2 hours without anyone joining ):
The dailies that you are expected to do become so tedious down the line that you just don't want to do them. Running them once a week or every day, rested or not, doesn't matter. They are not fun and it's precisely where you spend most of your time which is counter-intuitive.

If you skip them it slows your progression down to a halt. And if you don't progress then you have big trouble with the party finder. There is a curve and anyone below it has to compensate somehow. 

&#x200B;

Also no hard reset. This is how you get new players to get into the game. Hard resets, clean slate, even the playing field every 2 years or so. A powerpass and express events do not really work as you are still stuck with low roster, no cards  and you have to grind for months to get the gold needed for gear and other stuff. Asking my friend to join the game so he can grind non-stop for months while i carry him 24/7 until he can catch up is not how you get friends to try the game. In other MMOs a friend joins and within a week we are doing dungeons and raids together. QoL is how you keep players around.
The biggest issue with Lost Ark is its whole business model.  Everything else is a consequence of that.

Lost Ark is a game that wants players to work their asses of keep up with content releases while simultaneously dangling the possibility of just swiping to skip the grind.  Boring daily chores?  That's a feature, not a bug.  If the daily grind was actually fun and engaging then not as many people would pay to skip it.  Gatekeeping?  Only natural in a game that both requires a ton of work to gear up and also demands that players repeat the same over and over for income.

I don't know how you would fix these things without fundamentally changing the way the game works.
    Everything revolves around gold too much so it makes players feel like they should be maximizing their gold returns each week through raid homework.
    Yup, thats why the best thing that could happen to this game is a total relaunch and make it a real action rpg with loot and diverse content... Make raids an option for endgame loot but not THE only way. 

but this will never happen because it goes against what the korean studio wants from this game. They would need to practically relaunch the game with a new vision.

At this point they are waaaay too buried in their current game model to do a change this drastic.
        the grind will always exist so their is an incentive to pay to skip it.
Gatekeeping. And the fact this game is not that alt friendly. At this point of the game, you cannot leave alts, even if they are properly/over geared, at iLvl. You are forced to push your roster +20 ilvl above the minimum, multiply that by 6 characters, it gets incredibly expensive. Then you have to grind them all weekly/daily just to recoup the gold investment and break even. And its just going to get worse the higher we push. 

Then if you’re playing a dps, you then have to wait like 20+ min sometimes in a lobby for a support. You invest in all that grind for what? To sit in a lobby praying for a support? There is so much grind and time needed to simply just play the game aka raids. The game wastes your time. 

I honestly completely stopped playing my alts. I only play my main because its the only one who doesn’t get gatekept since its 1560.
Legion Raids are the biggest Win & also the biggest Loose. It's the only way to progress gear. Wipe mechanics causes gatekeeping. Legion Raids in LOA splits the community, causes toxicity. Players NEED to do Legion Raids on many characters and thus causing the anxiety to complete all of them while having a lot of dailies to do as well.
Time wasting content like Cube and Una dailies.
    Hate both. Boring asf.
I think there are 2 big issues. First is that the most boring content is the most rewarding, where you're heavily incentivized to spend a ridiculous number of hours grinding boring content to progress your character.

Second is the alt system. It is absolute garbage. There should be no relation between your alts such that they make progressing your main multiple times faster.

The end result of these 2 issues is just an absolute grindfest of boring content to finish all your homework every week. And because of that, everyone gets super upset if something goes wrong in raids, and just fuels the gatekeeping.

The most challenging content should be the most rewarding by far. Clearing brel g6 should give you more value than one 3-minute chaos dungeon run. It would at least mean you'd be able to play and progress just by doing raids and skipping the trash dailies. But it's just not a viable way to progress.
Number 1 issue is community gatekeeping since that is what will irreparably sour a player's experience when they have it happen every week. However, that issue is present because of a variety of issues that boils down to game design. Homework raids having party wipe mechs for one person's mistake, the 6 character gold limit and 3 weekly raids, the amount of daily homework, ability to inspect almost every facet of another player's progression, raids allowing hugely overgeared players rather than syncing them down after a certain point, etc.

Bit of a controversial take but I think bussing is also one of the biggest issues in this game. It fuels FOMO by making players who don't bus feel further and further behind, it further discourages playing with new players, and it even helps bots since there are plenty of players who will happily bus them. Some bussers delude themselves by saying they're helping new players by carrying them but the prevalence of busses discourages learning parties, dilutes the pool of competent pug raiders by bussing unskilled players until they get titles, and removes skilled players from the potential pool of pug raiders since they're bussing instead of doing standard runs. Really wish bussing was a bannable offense. It would still happen privately in discords but at least it wouldn't be clogging up over half of the party finder with WTS listings.
    With AGS tweeting a cartoon of a mokoko riding a bus with the text on it something like "tip your driver", I'm not expecting anything to change anytime soon.
        I mean, even if AGS hate  buses is on SG to do anything about it. They can sugest it but then all regions will need to remove busing and that's something that will upset a lot of people as well.
            But based on the tweet AGS doesn't hate busses. For anything to happen AGS needs to think it's a problem enough to bring it up with SG.  SG isn't watching the 'global' region. Based on the tweet it seems they're fine with the status quo.

Edit: they do all kinds of things that upset a bunch of people. Look at pheongate. There were people complaining about the golden frog issue handling.
                Busing is the way to retain new player to give them hope and progression to look forward to, of cuz smilegate likes it and encourages it, more players retained more possiblity of swipe, why not. A raid structure like lost ark, if without busing will die out pretty fast.
                    Or you create an incentive that encourages seasoned players to help new players. FF14 has a random queue that gives extra rewards, so you queue into low level dungeons but get the same rewards. A mentorship program could be added to the game. FF14 has that as well, and mentors get rewards. I've heard not all people who sign up are good mentors, but the company is trying.
                        Idk what smilegate will do, certainly thats possible if player count start to thin out. All raid mmo goes throughthe same thing/path, the other easy way is to move group wipe to hard/hell level, like different tier with different loot.
            Yeah, people shit on AGS too much sometimes. Sure, they're to blame for quite a few things, but SG also deserves a lot more criticism for the shit they're responsible for.
                I think it's fine to criticize AGS in this case. AGS could have tweeted "we're actively working on the bussing issue with SG." Instead they tweeted a cartoon that said "tip your driver".
                    Well, we don't know the nature of their contract with SG, and will likely never will.

Maybe they're in a position where they can't even mention it. I wouldn't be surprised, tbh.
    Your 2nd paragraph has all the reasons that I also hate the amount of bussing going on in this game. I can't imagine being a new player who does the grind to hit a certain ilvl for a new raid and gets told to take a bus because nobody wants to play legitimately with you without payment. I would quit immediately.
    [deleted]
        Reading all this makes it painfully clear you only play p2w mmos with mechanics in place to punish free players. The worse part is how willing you are to guzzle it all down, as are many others I'm sure.
            [deleted]
                I never said that you were wrong. I said that it's clear you only play p2w mmos that are designed to punish f2p players and are willing to guzzle it down. But that's just the state of anything f2p. That's why I stick to ff 14. I pay 15 a month and play a solid mmo that respects my time, doesn't punish new players, and puts everyone on the same playing field with no monetary advantages besides buying level ups.
The reason I came here is because I wanted to see the state of things because Lost Ark DOES have pretty damn good combat, visuals, and presentation and I wanted to see if it was worth it to come back. Your absurd comment, among other things, just made me feel gross and not want to even log in again. So back to ff 14 I go.
Im stuck on old content because no one is queuing for it and It "needs" 4 players to start. My friend wants to carry me but we still need 2 more players...shit is dumb as fuck.
    Yeah I thought i would hop into a Vykas hard lobby as a 1500+ to help out some 1460s get it done. I think we waited for almost an hour for supports as people trickled in and out. The game is honestly hopeless in this regard, and not going to get any better.
        Unfortunately, the 1460s in the current game aren't as skilled or geared as the 1460s when vykas was just released. Even on my paladin I ended up getting jailed trying to help 1460s 'cause they didn't do enough damage. Two people did 50% of the dps in gate 1, but gate 2 was the real jail when ppl just kept dying to stupid things. In the end, they got dps checked hard.
If you fall behind you stay behind.  

If it isn't character item level, it's roster level, or achievements.  

Its just hard to return to the game, then once you're back in, it feels like a lit of pressure to maintain your roster.
Biggest issue is the game doesnt matter , only raids and classes , with the systems that give such classes power , everything else literally can be thrown away and still be the same game , game could be a meny accesible from character selection that literally says honing , raid , chaos , such and such and thats it and still be 99% of the game , everything else does not matter and thats really bad
    I definitely see where youre coming from BUT you get runes, vitality potions, skill points etc from unas, rapports, and all the different collectibles. Yes if u dont have those, you can still do the raids completely fine. But they are still big part of the game if you want to min max your roster
        Yeah but realistically speaking thats just the incentive you have for doing all of that stuff , like every single one of those you already get as your character level up and gating those behind doing horizontal is well as i said just incentive so you do that stuff ,so its nothing unique ,and rapport and collectibles just give stats and barely nothing else besides map percentage ,and the other collectibles are more of the same , they are just systems for the lulz and barely make a difference besides skillpoints and runes you can alocate them anywhere else they dont need to be where they at and the game would still be the same ,so thats what i mean , when you really look into it beside the raids and playable characters everything else is just a shell to say you have something to do
            It’s still really important and some classes are pretty poor or below their ceiling without out it, if the skill screen load out was shown then I’d deny a lot of gunslingers for not having close to max skill point or lunar reapers for not having all their wealth runes. It’s not essentially but you really gimp your damage on some classes without some of the horizontal prog to the point where you do way less damage on some classes
                Yes but my point is , those skillpoints can just be givem to you as you level up , the so called "skill point" potion doesnt need to exist just like all of the other stats they give u as potions , they already give you stats , the other couple can be just included there ,its just a fancy way of getting them and thats it, runes as well they can just give them to you by doing guardians and chaos and that it ,the horizontal its just a fancy system to get them ,or the runes could just no exist and the abilities give more of what the runes already give and thats it ,or you can reduce stagger on bossed so you dont need overwhelm and classes can tranform faster so you dont need wealth , its just a fancy system of stuff you already have to keep you occupued but its not necessary because you already have it
                    So do you want non-raid content to matter or not? They have to have some reward for horizontal or else as you said it doesn’t matter. I don’t understand what you want if you don’t want the game to just be raids but also don’t want non-raid content progression to have power rewards? Some classes need those rewards or they have shit damage in raids so it’s not like those rewards don’t matter. Sure it’s a ‘fancy’ way of getting them but this is literally how video games work, you play them to progress, it’s like you guys have never played a video game before lol
                        Bruh how are you so dense lol , my point is ,the only reason horizontal matters its because of the rewards , but seeing it from outside the only reason horizontal gets done are the skillpoints and some runes , as a whole horizontal doesnt matter and the game would still be the same without it , im not arguing if the stuff matters or not ,of course skillpoints matter  my point is either you do it good or you dont and horizontal content is done like shit and behind it they are gating vital resources that they can just give in any other way and bot lose vita development time on horizontal content they dont know how to do ,of course i would like horizontal content to matter z but i want it to matter in a gameplay way , not matter just because it gives u skillpoints and other stuff that its only there to progress on other horizontal stuff that is at best half baked
                            If you are trying to say horizontal is shit and only required because of the skill points and runes then sure. Considering that there isn’t much required horizontal content and most people don’t play the horizontal content past what is required I doubt they will change it up much and just continue with adding small islands and events in the manner they have been doing
                                I know they will not change it because they dont need to , my point is the horizontal content is pointless and the game doesnt need it , it would still be the same game or better and the only reason it its there its because losr ark wants to mimick games like diablo and poe eithout understanding it is neither
                        They should just make side content give cosmetics IMO.  You need to do quite a bit of (IMO boring) side content to max out on skill pots.  Uninteresting side content is not why I play MMOs.  I'm a min maxer though, so I dredged through them.
The only driving force behind any activity behind this game is FOMO
    Which is player driven. Everyone knows it's the opposite, the longer you wait the easier it is to hone/gear.
    True. It was really hard for me to continue playing when all my friends rushed off to other guilds to progress through the content faster which led them to sitting around waiting for the next content update while I'm still enjoying taking my time.
        The best part is not having to do the whole learning prog. Getting to ilvl for raids 1 month after it comes out means that there are more players who know the mechanics. I've experienced learning runs and the same person was dying on the same mechanic for 2 hours+. Some people are just extremely bad at learning mechanics.
Game is exausting, 

I decided to "quit" because it was such a grindfest. 

I enjoy games where you play one character and one character only.  In lost ark it's almost a must to have alts to progress. 

Great game nonetheless.
    Hope you come back someday :) The game def is grindy but it can still be a lot of fun. Gatekeeping sucks though
        Thanks brother, 
I truely hope so aswell. 

I only reached around Ilvl 1405, and by the time I got there nobody took raiding seriouse and I could only "progress" through buss...  

I'm holding my fingers
            When I started playing the game back at launch I only had one character that I slowly pushed, I was among the last people to reach T3 of the people that started at launch because I took my time searching mokkokos and doing all the collectibles (also I changed servers and character before I reached lvl 50 too, so I missed all the Argos fiasco that people cried about)
I played only one character up until brel release almost, my character was always ready for content on release., now I started playing multiple characters but honestly it's possible to play slowly and be ready for content, it's just your gold income that will be a bit lower but other than that it's possible to play less then 6 characters.
If gold is really an issue and the feel of slower progress compared to others good solution is to just park alts at 1415-1445 range and just do raids with them and nothing else.
I don't have a +20 weapon right now so I'm "technically behind" based on some no lifers but I know I'll get there soon enough when it becomes relevant or needed, right now having a +20 brell stuff is only for flex and not needed at all for any current content.

Probably gatekeeping for people who don't have friends or an active guild.  


The second is the large amount of homework.
    Both are intertwined, if you didn't need to do so much homework to keep up you wouldn't mind taking a new player in raids. Without reducing homework gatekeep will only remain and make worst, specially after Brel HM.
A lot of dead content which is off putting for new players to do so much solo content or have to pass on stuff because they need a group to clear it, a couple QoL stuff like not being able to practice mechs from raids aside from like clown stuff, the horizontal content lacks any fun element to it and is mostly just fueled by FOMO. I just started playing about a month ago (1452.5 ilvl) so my opinion is obviously biased but that’s my 2 cents. All that being said I love the game and am having a lot of fun
gamedesign  resolve around  "Alts."

Also no other interesting activity other than doing the same thing 6 times.
    That’s why it’s best to play 6 different classes. An example is LoL where you do the same thing every match, but to change it up, you play a different champ or role
        While I see where you’re coming from it doesn’t apply to Lost Ark. Raids are literally sequenced with very small windows of variability. MOBAs require the same map because of the seemingly infinite combinations and interactions between heroes and game outcomes (and quite literally everything in between). So alts don’t achieve the same effect, it’s just different colours, positioning and tempo to do the identical dance 6x.
            I agree with this. LoL also has different runes/items that slightly diversify your champs playstyle and is still viable. There's really only a 2-way deviation in builds for lost ark chars and more often than not, there is a theoretical best build that significantly out-paces the other.
        Maybe at starts true but after a while you get used to character gameplay and they are feels the same .I can do chaos -guardians while watching movie :D Even better when playing paladin I can do all raids watching second monitor.
        Nah PvP games can't be compared. Every game feels different because your opponents are playing differently and they're picking different champions. Also the game is competitive so that spices up every match. Lost Ark becomes repetitive even if you have 6 different classes and the fact that you have to play 6 different classes just to 'fend off' the monotony of doing the same thing is indicative of the game's terrible gameplay loop.
I hate the party/raid wipes, it’s just no fun
    It would also help with gatekeeping if you dont have to depend on all 7 other players being good.
        Yeah I think it would
    I know they're meant to be anti-bussing, but there's got to be another way to approach it.
        There is a very simple approach, don't let people overgear content so much (ilvl cap on content) and then you can create less raid wipe mechs along with stricter dps checks and busing with a low amount of drivers instantly becomes unviable and only actual great players would be able to pull it off. ATM any average Joe can bus since they are so far ahead they barely take damage and just delete bars.

That is my biggest grip with LA (besides the obvious of too much dailies/weeklies). It is also what makes more than half of the classes "bad" because only burst builds really perform well in such short encounters, it trivializes content so quickly it is ridiculous. Some people already are miles ahead in item level BEFORE a new raid drops.
Gatekeeping and the community toxicity.
There are definitely issues that stick out a bit more than others. The biggest issue conceptually is probably the obvious low quality of communication between developers and publishers. I think this is the top of the umbrella for a lot of issues like tooltip translations, content releases, and public relations.

Another thing that I haven't seen mentioned yet is the godforsaken load time to launch the game. I know friends that have taken breaks, and when deciding to play again, they genuinely lose interest in the time between pressing launch and seeing their character screen. With bot prevention being another fairly objective issue in the game, I don't see the justification for this egregious of a load time (not to mention other games using the same anticheat with a fraction of launch time)

Within gameplay there are a few things. The lack of supports is obvious, but hopefully will be somewhat fixed with the release of artist. 

Chores are a big one for me. I see absolutely no logic in the daily chores having 2 lockouts. The fact that when doing chaos dungeons or guardian raids, halfway through we have to go back into the menu and reload into another instance, that makes no sense to me. With the wait time for full groups in legion raids, and the way selling/purchasing works on the auction house, I think we spend WAY too much time in menus, and not enough time playing the game.

There are other things that could use improvement, some of the monetization like pheon cost on ability stones, I think they have an illogical content trickle where we should have been front loaded more classes and skins, and class balance could always be improved upon. None of those things though would have the impact that the above issues being fixed would have on the game from my perspective.
    Load times for sure is a huge negative that seems to be very overlooked by AGS.
Gatekeeping and daily homework are the 2 big things I'd like to see addressed in the near future.  


Smilegate is tackling gatekeeping in steps already with the addition of easier card sets to get for new players, but I'd like to see some sort of horizontal combat-related rewards powerpass because the reason people are gatekept based on their roster level is because it correlates with a lack of skill points and other horizontal combat-related rewards.  


Daily homework is the tough one. Smilegate does everything based on data so as long as players are doing their dailies they won't see them as a problem despite community outcry.
Gate keeping, homework, and extremely alt heavy.
Lack of solo content - this is a bit personal but not being to grind/farm stuff on your own kinda sucks. If you dont include islands you have: chaos dungeon(too easy), guardian raid(worse solo), cube(worse solo and boring overall), and boss rush(not bad but not enough). 

Overly team dependent at times - this one feels bad the longer you play. Think of every wrong orb collected in valtan g1, every failed g1 vykas gate, every misplaced speed/slow puddle in vykas g2. You just slowly get grinded down realizing that 1 persons fuck up can and will end your run and it wouldn't be so bad but this often just leads to people getting salty and dispanding and potentially fucking up your progression on a char for a week.

Less viable content the farther you go- all you have in end game is weeklies and dailies. The same repeatable content every week until new content comes. Mainly what sucks here is guardian raids and dungeons and slowly lossing rewards from previous dungeons. You have to do the same guardian everyday(sometimes on multiple chars), and you get to say bye every guardian before that, most story bosses, t2 ocean abyssal, t3 abyssal, and even argos.

Lastly progression feels kinda bad- i say kinda because at the start of t3 its actually alright. Your honing at LEAST once a day getting new guardians to fight and unlocking new legion raids and so on. But around 1445 you start getting multiple caps on how fast you can progress. Your gold gated, material gates, and time gated on weeklys and dailys and the only way to get around it is alts but that cause new problems in itself.
People say homework and I agree, but I also want to add new player experience. The game is dead until 1415. Legendary Accs need their Pheon cost removed so people under 1415 can make cheap gear and play with each other instead of needing to buy a bus.
Too much stuff to do. You have to do your daily and weekly stuff on at least 6 characters for a decent progression speed. Economy is based on the gold income of 6 characters.


Either add rest bonus for legion raids OR let people apply a multiplication. Like rewards x6 on a single character but you won’t be able to earn gold on others. You basically take their gold entry. It would reduce homework. I would also make legion raid tokens that you need for gear family bound. Early gatekeeping would be reduced.
    This would increase gatekeeping. People would just say “don’t play on this character get on your main and just claim the gold on it”. Did you even think this through
        with that logic everything that gets added to the game is somehow increasing gatekeeping even when it's just 100 weapon dmg from some special mokokoseed found somewhere in the early area and can never be found again after you passed it. Like bro stop that shit. How do they even find out that you have characters better geared than the character you're applying with? We dont have a user database yet.

If you can ''Share'' every single drop from raids(Accessories, tokens ect + without a pheons cost) with your roster, you can easily gear your alts up with your main and if you feel like playing your alt, just go with it.

Have you ever throught about to create your own party/raid? Because if you really wanna play your low geared alt in the current high end content, then it's you trying to get carried and not everyone else gatekeeping you.
            Wait is there actually a special Mokoko seed early game that you are supposed to find? 😂
Boring homework for months without meaningful updates.
    Prepare yourself for 6 months of homework just for 3 gates Akkan that will be fun to prog for a week or two before you put it on farm.

what bot prevention?
        the market cap and buying cooldown
Not new player friendly at all 

Don't get enough raid mats, who wants to keep grinding the same thing just to get set bonuses every week on every alt, it's an absolute chore and dull as it gets.

BC prices.
I truly enjoyed the story, but the endgame just stops everything.
6x3 of the same raids is kinda mehh. It doesnt matter if you have 6 different chars, its always the same. Just do raids quick to gain gold which you lose because your chance to lvl up is 3%.

and this is actually what kills the game: ppl getting bored doing the same stuff again and again.
Biggest issue:

Endgame being all about raiding and nothing else.

You have a vast World but its a lie, is just a big unas map which is used mainly as a tutorial.

Ull end up in any queuing for a raid in the end.

Boooooring.
    This is the only mmo I’ve ever played. Could you explain what other games do do end game that isn’t repetitive content? And share examples
        14 has tons to do besides endgame raiding. that has also nothing to do with gaining power. rouge like dungeons, leveling the 19 different classes on a single character, collecting glamour (skins), housing, crafting and gathering with actual systems behind them and tons of other stuff that isnt homework or some weekly lockout
        In other mmos you could go to several older maps to farm something for example. But in this gane since the loot progression AND gold is gated in raids, theres nothing else to do but to raid. You cant go and farm a certain boss or a certain dungeon because everything is worth nothing in comparison to raid loot and gold.

The world is vast and beautifull but since drops are non existent (this game is not a conventional action arpg of loot collecting), you end up standing in town waiting for a queue. 

Unas, island souls etc doesnt count because those are collectibles, you dont earn thibgs that you can sell in the store to progress exploring the game. All is funneled in raids. 

This limits the experience greatly and missuses the vast amount of content this game has in terms of exploration and diversity. It just pleases hsrdcore raid players, which is not innerhently bad, but it turns out bad when is your only gameplan to keep people in.
            I disagree focusing in end game raiding is bad for Lost Ark, if anything is one of the strongest points and the biggest appeal of the game. The issue is how hard and grindy can get to progress specially after Brel Raid, the cost of honing is insane and the only way to do it is doing homework with 6 characters every day.   


That's the biggest flaw in my opinion, and what make focusing in more horizontal content pointless since the grind make player ignore it. If you could gain gear progression or have a true reset in gearing this wouldn't be an issue but SG refused out of fear to do so, so they keep delaying the matter and making things worst. There is a reason even in KR people is tired of doing chaos and guardian for 4 years non stop, having no alternatives to progress towards the raid is soulcrushing.
                Players ignore horizontal content not because of the grind, but Because the return of time invested on it is puny in comparison to the raid benefits.

Why would you invest time in content outside the raids of it is not only time consuming but also borderline useless in comparison?

On top of that, add the raid problem that you just mentioned. At this point the powercreep in gear is unberable already in global, and in korea is beyond it.
        My best example would be WoW (a subsciption based) where you can go back to older raids from previous Expansions to farm for free skins/transmog, pets, and mounts for the Cosmetic End-game.
            So repetitive content locked behind a weekly limited rng wall for 0 gain?
                If you don't want free stuff from easy soloable voluntary content, then don't do it? I prefer that over the constant raiding hamster wheel for Gold that is Lost Ark.
                    You tried giving an example for non-repetitive content and I pointed out that it is and worse then you what you were making it out to be.
                        It is non-repetitive because it is voluntary, i.e. you don't have to redo old content for cosmetic stuff if you don't want to. It is a repetitive chore if you make it become a chore. In Lost Ark, you need gold for nearly everything and the only way to get gold is through Time (Legion raids) or Money (Swipe).
                            It is repetitive if you want to get the thing you are hunting for which is the reason you are doing it. Just because its voluntary doesn't mean it is not repetitive and still has weekly lock outs and RNG behind it which means you could possibily never get those items.
                                Grinding cosmetics is repetitive anyways. Can sugar coat it, but it'll still be repetitive grinding. Tried a game where one outfit was locked at an abysmal 1% drop rate. Ran the dungeon 330 times for it. 

Swapping to support main instead is less stress. Easy to get into lobbies regardless. Have 3 supports and 3 alt dps. Can always use the supports to funnel the mats into 1 dps if I want to anyways.
        Best example I can think of is gear appearance: LA - Cash shop/Market purchase of Cash shop items OR spam chaos dungeons and pray you get lucky for 1 skin per class.

WoW -  you have almost 20 years worth of gear appearances obtainable from pretty much everything that you can use to make your character look unique and completely badass. 

I love T2 DB armor I'd love to be able to tmog it as my gear skin.
    The homework is annoying, but I agree, the biggest disappointment with this game is that spending time in the gorgeous world is next to useless once youve gotten a certain level of collectibles.
        So, just like WoW and FFXIV.
            Yeah I feel like that is a problem for most of the popular MMOs, you are in the same place most of the time and do the world exploration a few times and never look back. So a lot of beautifull maps and zones are there rotting since they are obsolete.
            Maybe its a problem with the genre, I haven't played those. Im just saying how I feel about lost ark 🙂
    Agree, raids are fine but it's literally a chore at this point
        As and endgame option is a greatvidea to have difficult raids... For the people that like raiding,

But gating everything behind raids is stupid korean lazy design.

What a waste of potential on a game.
            Nail on the head mate, raids are fine but shouldn't be the single point of progression,
1. Gatekeeping

2. Jailers

3. Pheons

4. Class balance

5. New players forced to buy bus.

6. Bots

7. Too much daily bs to do

8. Stone cutting rng
The player culture. You don't *have* to play this game like a second job, you don't *have* to have a full roster 1490+ and do dailies on 12 characters. But that's what a lot of people *choose* to do, and then they bring a super grumpy attitude to everything with the excuse that "the game made me do it."
No vertical solo content, there are just too many factors affect group wipe mech. No solo means this game automatically lock itself out from ppl like solo.
    It is a mmo and even then you can do everything solo except raids and even then some of them can be solo carried. I don’t get this comment……
        Most mmo has content for both group and solo, the true is solo biased player base is much bigger then group in general. When the game decays, you will have dufficulty to find 8 person to do raid, and the players leaving isnt those got gatekeeping but those experieced one got burnout, this is how raid die, lost ark isnt the first but wont be the last neither.
            Buddy, it is a mmo. It is made for people looking to interact with other people. You can’t solo current raids or dungeons in WoW and FFXIV and are ilvl capped in those games too. This genre caters towards people who want to play with others, this isn’t made for solo players who have every other genre and game heavily catered towards them. MMO’s that cater to a more solo style is what kills the game cause that makes less interaction between people and no connection to the game and they just leave. Go play Genshin, PoE, or Albion or countless other titles made for you.
                Raid itself cant be substained once players count dips below critical mass, to survive it has to have  some solo content in place, or constantly reinvent the game, like battlefield or CoD.
                    If a MMO doesn't have players then it is a dead game and even solo players are going to leave cause then there is no economy or no reason to play. Catering towards solo players in a MMO is the quickest way to kill MMO's cause solo players don't have any commitment and move on to new trends fast and have no connections to the community. Idk how u fail to understand the niche MMO's provide....they are not made for the solo player and never were lol
    Go play a SP game then?

Why would an MMO be designed for players to do things solo?

    [deleted]
        Right
        lol then he swiped his ass off because I started 2 months ago and I have been playing everyday for 10+ hours and I just got to 1500 today. Swiped ALOT and I had help too. Let’s not even talk about the fact that his roster level is probably 100 and he will be gatekept unless he’s in a group
    You CAN play one character and even only play its 1-2 highest raids (and mostly-unrested chaos dungeons and guardian raids, and some of the chaos gates, adventure islands and other stuff) - that way you can make just about enough gold, honing materials and gems to keep progressing the character to be ready (on minimum ilvl and gems lvls) for every new raid's release, just can't really be overgeared for the new raid and can't spend substantial amounts of gold on non-honing/gearing stuff such as crystalline aura, skins and pets, need to make do with the free ones (or spend real money), and can't take too large or frequent breaks (but can take a couple of days away from the game now and then).
        that is absolutely not true.

I only spent money on the two express event passes, I have about 3.5m worth of stuff to sell, I am currently 1576 ilvl and almost full level 9 gems.

I only play one main in a realistic manner. I also got a bard that's 1460 that I may or may not do raids with. I also got a second sorc that I will very rarely do any raid with, usually only argos and I got a reaper that I only buy buss from once in a while. Their only real purpose is lopang when I need silver and peyto/fernanda card packs. I do not run guardians or chaos with them except in the very rare occurence (I may have ran 2 turtles in the past month).

Alts are NOT even close to required.
            Agreed. Only have one main 1560 and I have a 1460 bard that I never play. You don’t need alts.
            Ok, then maybe there is even more leeway than I thought, the players I know (who have been able to catch up and keep up playing 1 character) started playing a month after launch and spent 0 money, but my point was also that alts are NOT required to progress main, they are just required if one wants to play more, have more bifrosts / card-buying characters, and such stuff.
                Ahh yes the "I play 6 characters and I don't have any time" crowd. It's so ironic that they chose to make and play that many characters when it's not necessary.
                    I choose to play multiple characters because I can and want to, I am aware I am this way actually less efficient and progress more slowly (and would only maybe be more efficient if I played an unreasonable number of hours per day or if I played in the most unfun ways) - my brother and I started at the same time, he plays half the hours per week than I, and has progressed much more quickly than I, in ilvl and even in horizontal content (in everything except roster lvl), in big part because he plays only one character. Once I finally decide on 1-2 classes I want to play the most or/and once I'll have less time, I'll likely play only 1-2 characters, if I don't quit raiding / quit entirely (by) then.
    You don't necessarily need alts, they just help with gold income, silver income, and fun. I only push with bound leapstones and I reached Valtan a week after release, Vykas on release, Clown on release, and I had two chars ready for Brelshaza on release. 

>The fact that we are still doing a year-old raid weekly is very dumb. There should've been a system where if you get your gear from the raid then you don't have to do it anymore, you can still do the raid but only for fun and not be something you MUST do. 

I don't understand the system you're proposing or why you even need one. If you want to do the raid, do it. If you don't want to do it, don't do it. I don't like Kakul, I do Kakul on 1 char only for the mats. Rarely do I do 18 raids weekly.
    The fact that we'll still being doing Valtan/Vykas for probably another whole year should tell you something.
Impossible to hone your gear- needing so much shit for it and the failure rate being so high u end up wasting so much materials its a nightmare 😭 Main reason why I stopped playing because the new continents require high levels and no matter how much I play I cant hone my gear to a correct lvl!!
It too often feels like you have to do everything you can possibly do with all your characters every week or else you will get left behind and gatekept.
Too much chores. Obviously some parts of the game are fun, but the longer I've played, the amount of fun has consistently shrunk and the amount of repetition has increased. Things like chaos dungeons and unas were never fun to begin with from day one but are just less and less bearable. The only thing that keeps me going is trying new characters every month more or less. I get to go through the building process and practicing to master the class(also limited which sucks as I'd enjoy doing more legion raids even without rewards). I'll probably start tackling hellmode when I find a group of chill people to play it with but once I've exhausted characters I enjoy, I'll surely quit to never return as I won't want to play catchup later for a character release.
The fact that you always feel behind unless you log in daily. Can only imagine what HM Valtan groups will be like after HM BREL? HM VALTAN, 1550+
\- Poor new player onboarding process for end game  
\- Inability to repeat raids for no/signifigantly reduced rewards  
\- No item level scaling/sync for raids.   
\- metric-ton of dalies spread across different modes requiring multiple loading screens.  
\- Lots of RNG related to actual progression spread across too many different systems. (Cards shouldn't exist, Ability Stones shouldn't exist, Engravings should be part of a basic talent-tree, Tripod levels shouldn't have RNG tied to them, etc etc.)

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, it's F2P. F2P devs would rather take 1 million dollars in a day over 1 trillion dollars in a week. It's all about the short-term pump and dump.
Card system is garbage, To much rng shoved into every system, feels like too much homework to do when u have a growing alt roster, bots galore
PLAY AS IF IT’S YOUR MAIN IRL JOB or be left behind also stupid homeworks
Everything bring 2x especially this game being alt heavy
The fact its so hard to find a learning party, even if I make one people don't watch a video, so for me to clear brel I need plc title to get that I need to do brel and I need to learn brel.. catch 22
If they deleted boss rush and cube and just made chaos dungeon drop more gems and silver, I'd be quite happy.

Oh and Unas...just give me 15 leapstones or whatever on daily login without farming loading screens.
I'll add to the symphony of "too much homework" replies and add that there are too many completely fucking useless daily/weekly tasks that are VERY uninteresting to do, yet you have to do them otherwise you lose out on stuff. Obviously you don't "have" to, but you know what I mean. If you're interested in progressing in the game and enjoy seeing your characters get stronger, you do "have" to. 

&#x200B;

I'm sorry but Unas are just dogshit. What's the point of doing them on each individual alt you have exactly? Same with shit like the bloodstone exchange. You should be able to set shit up so that it happens automatically and you can focus on actually playing the game. Instead you have to spend like 30 mins a week just swapping between alts and bringing them to the same fucking npc to buy the same shit you do every week. 

&#x200B;

It's all fomo-based, of course, but that's the way the game is designed isn't it? I'm fine with some fomo, but it's a bit much as it is. I've seriously lost a lot of my drive to play the game recently and the only thing that keeps me going is artist release coming up and me being 6 cards away from LoS30. But even then, I find myself just thinking "meh, do I even care" more and more the last few days. I'm just about ready to move on to something else and I definitely don't think I'll be back once I do. Way too much time lost on this. Raids should never be 18 a week, even if some are super fast at this point. An account's raid income should come from like, 3 raids a week that's it. The rest is just do as you want/need if you want to grind gear on some alts etc. There's so much other shit to do in the game but most people don't even try to because you can't unless you play this like a full time job.

&#x200B;

I love the combat and the raids in this game, just like most people, but yeah, I legitimately can't see myself sticking around for Brel HM.
Dailies ground me into a paste and ability stones were just depressing.

I took just a literal one-day break from the game at one point shortly before clown release to just chill with some friends and literally couldn't stand the thought of logging in after that, so I realized it was time to quit. Never looked back.
The community 💀
1. Bots
2. Disconnects
3. Quality tapping missing a pity system where every 100 rolls or 1000 if you want to get sadistic should guarantee an increase in 1
    Yikes, disconnects are probably a you issue at this point. And there are way more prevalent issues than bots, asking users to do 2 guardians and 2 chaos each day make people quit way before any bots do
        Yikes, can you please explain what happened to me and my group here then.  
Also, none of us 8 got any re-entry ticket. Yikes.

https://preview.redd.it/6u24bwr61sma1.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb78f2f6bd3f39adcd959ce6da00b79d997d0177
            O no, you missed out on 5 Brel horns in the 15th week you’re definitely gonna quit the game now I’m sure. What makes people quit the game are the endless chores and burnouts. This is one unfortunate thing that happened to you that impacts maybe 15 min of your time, chores are 2-3 hours a day
                O no my bad, I guess I didn't read the title of OP's post and that disconnects that are surprisingly happening until now is **NOT** a big issue.

Imagine reading. Yikes.
        Kek, op asked for biggest issues and disconnects are hands down one of the biggest issues since it has and will continue to actually ruins players' immersion/experience/raids.

Meanwhile you on the other hand think 2 guardians and 2 chaos a day is a big issue when players can opt to skip them or use rest bonus. Imagine not using rest bonus in 2023. Players are given an option when it comes to homework, but they can't do anything when it comes to the servers/disconnects XDDDD
gatekeeping. the topic and word has been beat to death. my arti is 1500 with 1 piece of brel gear and I was getting denied from other 1500+ clown groups with my clown title on and 218 rosters lmao. this was multiple groups. I literally alt f4d. also making your own group really doesnt help, it never fills. or you’ll wait an hour just to find everyone plus a support.

sad part is its easier to find a brel group on ilvl. if it’s old content people want you 50ilvls overhoned so it takes 10 minutes to clear. doesnt matter that I can do clown deathless or that i’m 1500 ilvl. I need to be 1525 omegalul

also content, mainly replayable content. I want something like infinite chaos dungeon that I can spam and play my main more. i’ve been getting bored with my alts but I love my arti, but there’s only so much I can do on him and carrying night fox yoho gets old
Disconnects - imagine losing your weekly entry to the only thing that you like about this game (legion raids) and not getting a re-entry ticket when it is also caused by a server issue.
dailies feel like a full time job :(
bots
They could give that engravings support system to every mokoko. It'd help tons with gatekeeping and progressing!
Literally feels like a job. And this is me quitting 3 months ago. It was fun but nobody wants to work in a game.
It’s really overwhelming when you first start, the sheer number of currencies is insane. I’m new and I love the combat but I just can’t get my head around all the different interfaces and I feel like if I don’t learn everything I’ll gimp myself. (I like to min max in other mmos)
Dailies take too long and/or are too repetitive/boring. I like just about everything else
Way to much daily
Newcomer/Veteran gap.  It is impossible to improve gear at low levels without a Power Pass, and even with a Power Pass, it is difficult to reach all achievements due to empty matchmaking for raids
Stupid dailies, just make it 1x of both.
It’s talked about to death on Reddit but the biggest thing for me is the pheon system. I genuinely hate the whole concept of them, and the fact that I know they will never be removed or even changed in a beneficial way kills my desire to come back.
Gatekeeping and pheons 
I personally have been gate kept from doing vykas on my 1480 summoner many times just because I'm not 1500 and I havent done brel it's insane how people now on the fastest raids with the ilvl we are at now just gatekeeping new and lower ilvl alts just cause it's not 1500 and pheons dude I had 200 pheons and lost all of them trying to get a better stone for a 5x3 to this day I dont have a 5x3 on my dps alts since I'm a support most of my gold just goes to funnel my dps alts into higher content but the rng and pheons cost even with the nerf on pheons it's almost impossible for me at least.
Pheons and grind tie for first place.

Pheon literally gates players from build testing in practical scenarios (rather than relying on Trixion), stop players from diversifying builds or having multiple characters, replaceable engravings, etc.

The grind keeps all the new mokokos from access to the meat of the content in late tier 3 where there's raids of all sorts. 

And in second place, tie between botting and gatekeeping.
community
Too many dailies, too many buses making you feel kinda crappy playing the game as intended for half the weekly income, too many imposters unwilling to go through learning groups
Game is just too hard to get back into. Quit for six months missed clown and Brel release now I can't get into parties or learn the raids like everyone else did sure I can watch videos but that is no where near the same practice as wiping for hours and getting first hand experience with every single mechanic. Idk just something wrong with the game that needs to be looked at
more server merges i have friends on some servers were rowen pvp isnt even do able at peak hours 

merge more servers so that its easier to do islands and things
I feel like most issues are clear with homework (daily and weekly) that makes gatekeeping harsher. Specially in the current momento of the game, we are doing a 6 gate raid for months and now we will be doing the same 6 gate raid, more annoying and time consuming to do to get a new set of gear again... This will increase the gap between active players and ocasional players not to meantion how further and further behind new players are. Wich will make gatekeep even worst as well.
Too much useless and boring "content", the most horrible UI/UX I've ever seen.
playerbase
For a game who's progression is hard locked behind how many alts you have to raid/sell carries on, there's WAYYYY too much buildup required to play a new class.  
 Pheons, tripods, character level, engravings, ability stone, accessories, gems, shards, etc.  


 And the worst part is all of these things besides character level can be nullified or completely bypassed by spending money on G2G or the cash shop.  It makes wanting to play a new class extremely daunting.
Toxic community, BOTS
i feel like the bots that we ignore because we're so use to,turns new players off a lot. every single new player I've met i ask them hows the game... they all say what's up with the bots?... great first impression..
Bussing.
No way to casually enjoy the game its really hard to sell this game to my friends because you have to do so much work to get started and it's non stop hw until you're set up on at least 3 characters
the only reason gatekeeping exists is the support shortage

if there were more than enough supports to go around then support parties of on-ilvl people would exist and it would be fine, but as is rn all the supports go to like 1520 valtan parties while everyone who's 1445-1460 just buys a bus cuz they can never make their own party and get 2 supports
IMO there's too many small problems with Lost Ark:- 

* Too many dailies/homework 
* The ability to run earlier raids but then no incentive to help out new players like FF14 
* Supports and their skill set which deters people from playing them Gold earners being 6 (it should be a multiple or 4 to match the 3:1 ratio between DPS and support) 
* Current PVP 3v3 is broken/dead and they continue to add more PVP content before fixing it 
* Outdated characters not being worked on (WD and Scrapper mainly) and popular changes being asked for ignored (sorry Glaiver) 
* Ship liners and sailing quests in general 
* Adventure islands not accounting for dead servers or off timings 
* Some instances will have the full 30 players and the next one will have 1-5 (you should all be in a collective waiting spot and then it splits accordingly for limited spots)
* Legacy content that doesn't make sense anymore like some random ass engravings and the old Guardian Raid maps. 

The list goes on, that's just on the top of my head. All of these are really frustrating and little by little chip at you and make you wanna quit.
If you miss prog of a new raid, you're basically fucked. Even if you try and do learning parties the learning parties are always out of sync as far as the level of progression, you're always going back to the very beginning. It's pure pain and given raiding is tied to progression it can really stall your progress.  


No idea how a new player is supposed to get past this let alone someone who simply was on holidays when a raid was dropped (looking at you brel, xmas holidays) :D
dailys are boring as fuck and take too long. after stronghold reaches lv50+ there should be a research that reduces your daily homework. 1 chaos dungeon per char instead of 2 with double rewards. that alone is enough to make me happy, i don't mind doing double guardians
Too much homework..

I hate gate 5-6 brelshaza, caliligos sucks, doing 2 guardians on each character sucks even with rest bonus
I just feel so good after uninstalling, like I quit a really dangerous drug or something.
Homeworks led to gatekeeping, fomo and toxic behaviors.

Fk this game
Everything is time gated in this game.  Honing materials, gold, relic gear mats from legion raids, even "side" content like Una task reputations and most collectibles are all time gated.  This means that if you take a break or stop being efficient for a certain period of time, you're behind for that period of that.  If you quit for 6 months then return, you're 6 months behind.  There's nothing you can really do as a player to close the gap outside of swiping (this is by design).  If I play a game like BDO and I'm making 6B a day while the average person makes 1-2B, I can quit for 6 months and catch up relatively quickly in my progression.  

Time gated content and the lack of content for a single character forces players into playing ATLEAST 6 characters to not fall behind.  Then, because you have so much content to do on 6 characters everyday/week, people start gatekeeping legion raids.

Any new or returning player is then forced into a weird situation where they might wanna learn the raids but no one wants to accept them for fear of being jailed / having their time wasted.  The raids are also fairly difficult at first.  The mechanics are not obvious at all.  It's not uncommon to die to something and have no clue what you died to.  If I go raid in an MMO like World of Warcraft, I can walk into a raid completely blind and be fairly confident that most of the mechanics will be fairly obvious.  Not to mention you have multiple gates per raid that you need to learn, each of which have multiple raid wiping mechanics if a single person fucks up.  Even once you do all your research on the fight until you have a basic understanding of most mechanics, you go look in party finder and no one accepts you because you don't have 5x3, lvl 10 gems, high roster level, LOS18, no title.  You're then forced into a situation where you NEED to get the legion raid done that week to not miss out on the relic gear mats.  So you have to decide to either: spam refresh for hours hoping to find a learning party, buy a bus, or keep honing for a couple more weeks until you're way above Ilvl for that raid.  This is why everyone buys a bus.  It makes more sense to just buy a bus to not miss out on relic gear mats so that you have a better chance of not being gatekept in the future.

In order to fix some of these issues what we need is:

*  A way for players to practice the raid mechanics (similar to Prokel in Trixxion) for every single raid.
*  Some sort of Sherpa mechanic where veterans are incentivized to help newer players in exchange for some sort of reward.  And new players know that they're in an environment where they're not being a burden on 7 other people.
* Maybe some sort of incentive to hit that Matchmaking button so that new players have a quick way to get familiar with some of the fights without feeling like they're a burden on a premade group in party finder.
My friends are not playing anymore, so I would say low player base and some servers dying, with no migration possibilities. Playing  this game alone sucks.
Being locked out of content for the week on your main after clearing once. It forces you to make alts if you want to play more and creates a "weekly homework" mentality.
Chaos dungeon importance.... skipping chaos dungeon especially on your main hurts you more than skipping legion raids. I am not a fan of chaos dungeon, I think it's poorly designed so i only do it daily on my main, gold earner alts do rested only and I can feel the shards blackhole/silver blackhole.
gatekeeping

the game is very terrible for new players tbh
Immagine you want to return on this game and you face several issues:

1)Bots
2)Huge grind walls to catch up
3)Necessity of alts to catch up and remain relevant
4)Keep farm same content over and over on multiple characters
5)Balance issue in terms of how some build perform and how much gear is required to make said build work.
6)Overwhelming amount of horizontal progression to do


Overall, feels more like a chore than playing the game for fun.
The raids are too heavily centered around wipe mechanics, often feels more like a puzzle game and that everything I built for my character doesn't really matter.

It brings a lot of toxicity and we don't play with new players because of them.

I cant think of anyone liking the mechs, otherwise trying to skip them wouldn't be a thing.
I think the most overlooked one is accessibility in general.    

 I wouldn't mind doing the homework if the experience wasn't so miserable. You can't sneak in a chaos dungeon whenever you have a few minutes of free time because the game takes so long to start and when it does actually start you feel like you have to do all your dailies because you already went through launching the game. Not to mention a lot of the dailies are loading screens and menus that lag your game when you open them. I would leave my game open to jump in and chat with people from time to time but it uses 60% of my computer resources with nothing on the screen and EAC is preventing me from launching a lot of other games at the same time.     

The community aspect of the game is pretty much destroyed and is all in discord just because of how hard it is to be social in game. This is an MMORPG but the MMO part is only felt on discord and party finder and I feel like it's not the problem of gameplay or design itself but the difficulty of accessing the game.    

I'm surprised how they managed to make one of the smoothest and most polished mmos I've played with:  
* Longest launch time I've ever seen in any game.
* Loading screens every few steps.
* Confusing, bloated and extremely laggy UI.
* Chat, friends and guild systems so bad that it's hardly manageable without discord.
* Very resource hungry game without much happening on the screen.    

Edit: typos
My biggest pet peeve is with how much of your income is gated behind Legion Raids. I love the raids in this game. It's super fun to clear it on my main, and even a handful of my alts on most weeks. But 18 raids a week feels trash, especially when it's the same one again and again.  


Now you might say "nobody is forcing you to do 18 raids a week". And you're right - nobody is. But if I want to progress my main, my options to do so is limited if I'm opting out of raids. In my opinion, the game could benefit from having a more diversified gameplay loop. Not just eat, sleep, raid, repeat with Chaos/Guardians to fill the gap.
3rd party RMT enjoyers  
Amazon Game Studios  
Easy Anti-Cheat  


the game is fine, the fault lies with selfish players and incompetent publishers
1. A system were is mandatory to have a roster with many alts in order to progress in the game. ( Don't try to justify it with "you don't have to play many characters, you can play just one) because that's bullshit, you can't progress in the game with the weekly gold of one single character because that's less than 15k a week, which is nothing.
2. The fact that we are so behind from Korea, it was told that we would catch up fast and it has been already a year since the release, and we are still one year behind Korea. Aero was released a year ago and we are getting artist next week, we won't ever catch up and this rate and that is painful, because we could all be playing RU server with VPN and enjoy the content that they should have release already in here. The raids are kind of understandable, the characters not.
3. As mentioned before, character's release is not content, it is something that should be done instantly since the release in Korea, nobody cares about creating a berserker woman in fking 2024... we wan't the characters now, not after years.
4. Uncontrolable bot situation. In a f2p game with an open market and trade system, the bots destroy the whole enviorment, and it is sad but there is no way to stop it. Ban waves are useless and people just need to check steamcharts to corraborate that, after a ban wave the same amount of bots are back into the game 1 week after.
5. PvP is the biggest trash I have seen in a long time, and I love PvP in mmo's.
6. Gatekeeping is ridiculous, and the biggest reason why most of the people I know have left the game. As simple as limiting the party ilevel, if there is a 1490+ group in valtan, that they could neither have supports 1460+ in their group and only 1490+ supps. It is just an example. A group 1460? then you can't invite 1480's+ in your group... etc.
7. The point 6. would also fix the bus situation, which is already ridiculous, over half of the groups for any raid in the game, is a bus.
8. 21 classes + announced for 2023 in Korea are DPS, only 3 classes are support. Disgusting for a game were it is a must to have support for the content. No more words needed.
9. Supps are designed like shit. 2 skills to give atk.p and 2 skills to shield. Then a heal in x and atk.p in z. Boring as fuck.
10. The list could go on and on but fuck it, I'm tired of writing for something that didn't change in over 5 years in Korea, and certainly won't change in EU/NA just because we aren't happy with the game design. Have a good day!
A lot of the issues revolve around monetization and cultural issues, i.e. Koreans tend to be more accepting of the techniques Smilegate uses than NA and Europe.  

Given the success of Diablo Immortal, I don't necessarily blame Smilegate for what they do, except that it represents a massive misunderstanding of the Western MMO market.  We grew up with games like Everquest, WoW, FFXI, FFXIV, Wildstar, AoC, DOAC, etc.  We're used to a subscription model even if in recent years, most MMOs have migrated to the F2P model. 

LOA has a mobile monetization strategy, and that's just not going to sit well with the Western MMO audience because I think many of us avoid mobile games because of the monetization.  AGS did remove some of the worst elements (Mileage shop, Yoz jar, Esther weapons), but they still left in enough to drive people away.  

If AGS could negotiate with SG to remove a lot of the monetization and maybe give people a compelling offer to get the aura, I think they'd have a lot more players.

Beyond that, the bots are insane, they need to at least finish the captcha.
couldn’t you just look at any of the 872772 complaint threads
The whiny playerbase and the design of the specialisation class.
Running a teaching party should be more rewarding than bus runs. No idea if this is possible but it would help the game alot imo.

The most fun experience in this game is doing legion raids with everyone knowing what they're doing. Worst experience (after honing) is the opposite, wiping and getting jailed because of one or a few new players.

Reducing daily chaos/guardian to 1 won't change much since the new meta would be to do it on more alts.. or even on alt accounts.
Probably downvoted opinion but:  The whiny/negative playerbase.  The only thing that's demotivating me to play the game is when I open discord, forum, etc and only see people complaining and being negative about everything. Like just quit if you hate the game so much.

Not saying you cant dislike the game, or have any negativity about it. I'm mostly referring to the people that just constantly are negative about everything, never positive. Brings the mood down and demotivates me to keep playing.
Not much, amazing game.
The amount of homework and the disparity between KR and NA. They have so much content and it feels like we have none
    I don't understand this either... Yea the daily grind is ridiculous but we have a ton of content... What they should do tho is reduce the shard/honing cost on the top end after brel hm comes out. The grind is ridiculous and i dont think NA has the patience to wait 4-6mo for akkan.
    We got wayyyyyyyyyyy more content than they did during the time we’ve had lost ark, what are you even talking about. In 1 year we got as much as they did in 3 years
Their pvp scene is non existent, their “hard” raids keeps getting nerfed to the point good players can beat it with 1 hand, feels like a job, bots.
Personally I feel like the horizontal continent is sometimes not rewarding at the end of the day considering the amount of work and time you put in it. It doesn't help that most of it is RNG also which in the end results in doing horizontal content look pointless. Pursuing vertical content on the other hand will result in being gate kept and sometimes it's hard to find a static for this content
At least for me, LF Sup waiting times. While it's a problem across MMOs with very few of them solving it, it really drags out the party finder experience.
    The problem is also thtt the game revolves around supports but there are only 2.

You can of course do raids without supps but it takes more time and coordination. And it seems raids are now designed with supports in mind. 

There is also a missed opportunity with Fighters, you are telling me we have 5 fighters all damage dealers but coming from a land where ki , meditation, balance, etc. is the norm there is no fighter that fulfills the support role by taking care of their teammates with their spiritual background/knowledge? Kinda like Karma from LoL,  Anikka is basically Ionia.

The Summoner could have a third class engraving being a support role. Kinda how Azena/Innana, help you in the story. Many creatures at her command and all they do is attack but not protect/support the team.
        They kinda wanted to rework soulfist into dps/support hybrid like gunlancer year ago but it was 30% dps nerf for some marginal support benefits and really not popular with really anyone so they backtracked. If not for being a dragon ball homage it should've been a support really, hell, Wei is soulfist++ and he heals just by standing near people.

Also the only way Azena knows how to support is sending as many ancient spears as needed to kill the bully...
            I didn't know about that Soulfist rework.

But I think Wardancer/striker and Scrapper are too much punch already. And Soulfist is too many beams and energy balls but lacks the punchy side of Dragon Ball. They don't know how to design classes.

And they also failed at the Azena - Summoner conversion, because as you said Azena makes spears rain every second but it's one of the slowest skills for the Summoner in cast, animation and cooldown animation.
                For soulfist punchy you'd have to take out like half a tripods from Pummel and put them in a new skill because almost all martial moves are fist handwaves or hitting with our hip. Most energy attacks are also trash. It is a bit sad to see that there is 0 build variance between class engravings. Both use the same skills, tripods, spread of gems and are only distinct by small change in speed.
        Can someone please give this man a job at SG
            Ty. But don't get me started in Arthetine's classes. So much technology but apparently it all goes boom.

The Scouter could have another engraving( why only 2 branches?) where the drone can shield and reduce damage or create safe zones for the party. Or just another class that uses the drone and other devices to help the team.

People say that we don't have male mages or assassins because they need to create the body/models but they went and created the specialist classes, when we could have had more supports with the current models.

(and save this for later but the mages and assassins are going to recycle the striker/gunners' bodies)

Edit: I thought at first that the  Arcanist was a support class, with her cards being buffs for the party or nerfs for the enemy and different utilities for different situations all ruled by RNG.
    We have 1 week until this problem is temporarily fixed. Then people will just make their artist a lopang slave later on.

 But short term there's going to be alot of supports here soon!
        In low-level content, sure, but how many of them will even make it to Brel?
            Even those that do make it will not have yearning and I assume not many pugs wants to deal with that.
            Brel G6 is Dps shortage
                This is not true.  I have both sups and DPS in my roster.  My sups are still instant-accepted in 5-6 runs while my DPS often end up sitting in lobbies waiting for sups...
                    weds to friday is lf supp then it slowly changes to lf DPS starting around Sunday night onward from my experience
                    probably because you are playing dps early in week where there is supp shortage.Later in week there are lot of support for last 2 gate.
                        Nope, I don't play *either* until 'later in the week' (at least by this subreddit's standards...).  I have an actual job and don't have time to run a bunch of raids on Wednesdays.  The majority of my raids happen on the weekend.
            Only the people already doing that content on supports lol. There may be a few outliers who switch to support main because of artist, but it won't be the majority.
New player experience… this is the issue that prevents growth and sustainability
I wish it wasnt so repetitive/grindy just to keep up with the latest content. Example: when hard Brel was announcement the time frame was just enough to get enough honor shards in chaos dungeons for a average hone to 1560.
A lot of issues could be solved by just giving gold for 1 character in the raids instead of 6.

Gatekeeping would be less since people would be more willing to take time in a raid because gold is the main thing people want from their 6 characters.

"Homework" issue would be less since you'd only raid more if you wanted to instead of feeling forced to do the raids 6 times.

I'm not sure how much gold the gold earning character should get from the raids though to help keep up the honing of alts. Maybe honing of characters that are lower level than your main should have reduced costs in gold? I don't know I'm just brainstorming.

To answer your question the biggest issues I hear people say is homework and party finder.
Idk if it s such a big problem per se, but i hate bots and gatekeeping, homework isnt that bad due to the rest system
since I never lived the gatekeeping part of the game and I like playing the game so I don't mind doing all the stuff , I don't see (gatekeeping and homework) as problem to my end.
no class reroll system =/
Hmm, maybe Gatekeeping (that I am unaffected of because all my chars are geared) but its certainly really shitty for new players to get into the game.. and we need a fresh and steady influx of new players.

Other than that on a personal note (its not gamebreaking) but its really tough to see KR have an open API and have nice tools and pages while we have nothing of this. That would personally be one of my biggest QoL things to get.
Bots. All MMOs can have bots but implement barriers that make them nonexistent unless you really look. AGS games thus far have an open gate with only minor inconveniences which hurt players more than bots.
Bots imho.

Still bots:

they cause artificial inflation because of RMTers buying out low price stuff. Unsustainable inflation pushes away the average player, because in order to keep up with RMTers and whales they have to slave on dailies and farm raids on 6 chars. So they contribute to FOMO even more than the game is already doing by design.

Bots also push away new players, because lets be honest if at the beginning I saw this many ZXCXZADASDHs while levelling I would have unistalled the game. (Now I'm already invested/addicted :()

And then when the few new players who got past HH spam, see prices on the market (see my first point) for gearing their main...

As of late I'm seeing more and more of them on my server (Neria EUC), it is showing as busy again on prime time which would be incredibly good for me were not for the 6-7 chennels I see while doing leapstone unas in Shushire.

I might be wrong and speculating too much on bots effect, but I genuinely think they exacerbate most issues pointed out in this very thread.

o/
Party wipes arent very fun tbh.
The problem are djkkkilllffn and ghigguyllidd and all their friends
All the homework you have is self imposed, you can play 1 characer and do all homework in like 1h every day, but ofc if u get 10 characters the homework piles up. my personal issue is the rng upgrades, rng stones,rng gear,rng quality,rng bracers,rng drops, too much rng. that is the biggest issue of the game. my oppinion.
Shitty publisher and an even shittier dev.
Bots
Bots
Necessity of a static group of 8. A lot really goes into this (gatekeeping, bussing, etc.), but it really is the thing that put the damper on me really wanting to progress much these days.
Bots
burnout and BC prices
Need harsher punishment for RMT players. 

I understand bots are an on going problem, but if people stop fucking buying from them, they'll eventually slow down since it won't be worth it.

Also, why the fuck are bots still advertising in party finder?
the endgame for me is always auction house/market so the biggest issue is bots.
1.bots

2.servers and performance, and other ags/sgs  blunders

[2.in](https://2.in) game systems (gacha)

3.repetitive bland and excess grind (chaos, guardians, unas is over half of LA)

4.dwindling players

5.class identity seem to fall into a "league of legends champion" design principal. all classes have 8 spells and awakening, and almost all are orb spenders and gauge managers. this leads to some very simplified gameplay persistent across a lot of classes in lost ark 

6.i can see raid quality increasing by huge leaps just from argos-brel, but it seems that legion raids themselves could use more work on the actual mechanics (just swapping out stagger check mechanics for more unique mechanics or even safety dances with other checks would alone improve each gate, have less than half of raids use a meter mechanic)

&#x200B;

made a list why idk, 1-6, 1 and 2 are by far the largest problems
The lack of power passes for new players.
As somebody still new to the game (just hit 50) the world is dead, handful of bots per zone
Too much time to setup 15min of raid gameplay which is always the same. I do play with guild and we have to do spreadsheets and shit like that just to group up chars for busses and normal runs. If you go without guild it’s still party finder 15min… pretty shit

Tldr; it’s not easy to jump in and just queue content with people.
Chaos dungeon just so boring
Forcing the whole playerbase through mechanically difficult content to progress. Casual players are needed in an MMO ecosystem. FFXIV does a great job in this regard with making hardcore, even midcore content optional, but worth it.

And secondly, AGS censorship.
i am still lvling up so my views are from there

1. bots, yea too many of them.
2. quest lines bring u to too many places
3. gold is the main issue. i want to build all these advanced trade skills tools and am like no gold :(
4. getting to a certain gear score to be able to play a certain area.
Pheon and the money lock system
If they reduced the amount of daily garbage you have to do by at least half I would consider coming back. Until then lost ark is dead to me. LMAO no way im doing 2x chaos gate and guardians every day its a literal snoozefest
Just need 1 word lmao - - > pheons
Chaos, guardians, unas, both, weekly-daily, cubes-boss r, silver and shard cost. Like, give me mats playing fun content, legions,
Been said 3thousand times already: gatekeeping+too many dailies
The biggest issue is that smilegate do not read any of this valid and important feedback.
Every day is hours a bad hours of things I don’t really want to do. Not doing them leads to lack of silver or materials to continue improving, which sucks.

I see no reason why I need to do 14 chaos dungeons and guardians a week per character unless I want to bite the bullet and progress slower (which I do on some, but not my main)
way too many repetitive homework tasks. the only way to push your character being doing every homework task non stop. its boring. both my friends who loved the game for a long time quit because they didnt ever want to do another guardian or chaos dungeon again in their life.

raids have too many gates and each encounter takes way too long. i dont want to wipe on minute 15 of brel gate 6. its fucking awful. no gate should take longer than 8 minutes.
Finding people in the dungeon finder for the content below endgame...
Can't solo this.
Last week I wanted a day off lost ark so I took a vacation day off work just to do Lost ark homework so I can have a free night after work. 

That's tuff.
Being able to see people's gear. I swear if it wasn't possible, more people would complete their homework a lot faster because 9/10 times when you get jailed is because someone doesn't know what the fuck is going on in the raid moreso than a lack of DPS.
I need 200k gold to get 5x3 so I can join Brel lobbies. That will take a month of chores, games are meant to be fun not chores. When D4 comes out there’s a huge chance I quit if it’s any good.
Brelshaza and party finder. There isn't enough supports at that ilvl, so waiting for the raid to start is such a pain. Sometimes it takes 30+ min to start and that makes me not want to attempt it at all

I just wanna hop onto the game, start a raid instantly and clear within reasonable time. Brel really took the enjoyment out of the game even though the gates are fun once I'm inside with a competent group
Game time has significantly gone down because there no new content and Brel hard is not new content IMO.  Introducing another character like artist will not make it new as it’s doing the old content once again.   G spam for South Vern and Rowen.
Not giving me 30 selection packs /s
[deleted]
    Feel you man, it’s like what else if there to do when you quit? You gotta find something else to do for fun to take your mind off the game and soon you’ll just let go and not look back
Homework. We started 6 friends and got another 5friends of friends. Now only two of them left playing the game. I quit 3 weeks ago and I don't see my self going back to this workload. Had 6 chars all brel. With only one g6
PHEON i can suffer the rest but not this shit
I know I'm not alone here how is lack of support not being mentioned more? Gatekeeping is related but support lack feels like the absolute root of the problem. I don't mind doing my homework, I just fuckin hate waiting an hour to get to do my damn homework. I just wanna play the game. Just drop party finder and have a matchmaking that gives you 2 supports. Sure you'd have que times but you'd play eventually. I know that's a shit solution I just idk man sitting in PF with 6 people for 30 minutes makes me want to die. I literally need a second game to play while I sit in lobbies. But EaC even prevents that so fuck me
RNG stacked on RNG stacked on RNG
Existing
Too much homework, I quit to get my life back. Now when I log in I want to do a raid but my static replaced me and I don’t want to pug. Doesn’t help that I kinda suck at mechs too
Pheon.
I think bussing is a real issue.  New players are forced to bus. No body will take them because of gatekeeping.
I want an alternate story quest line where Armen doesn't interrupt every god damn fight
HONING
Make the CD and guardian raid entry from 2 to 1. Ffs 12 CD a day killed my motivation.
Nothing to do besides raids. Raids get boring after a while because you do them so many times a week.
Gate kept by life
Besides the awesome points already said. I have to say classes are badly designed.

Yes it feels cool to land hard hitting skills, Doomsday and Explosion animation and sound effects are perfect. Arti's bombs feel cool, GL's blasting stuff is cool.

But more than half skills of many characters are useless and it gets worse if you point out that not all are useless, but some are counters and weak point skills.

So we need to use counter skills in rotations and sometimes we miss the counter because it's on cooldown.

But also it doesn't matter if you wanna add some skills to your rotation because they look cool, many of them do low damage or have 0 utility outside of buffing yourself for the high damage skills which are most of the time only 2 or 3 skills of all your repertoire.

And then we can talk about the other 3 stats, Domination, Endurance and Expertise.

Seriously by name alone I think Domination or Endurance could have been used for Mayhem Zerk and Demonic Impulse SH. Also Domination for Master Summoner cause she can control giant spirits without them going berzerker against their own team. 

Expertise for the gunners and CO Summoner because you know they became experts at controlling weapons and the elements respectively.  Specialization for Deadeye/gunslinger that wanted to focus on a build that cancels one of their weapon.

But no, we are in the wrong universe
You can only do their best content (legion raids) once per week. They should just allow people to do legion raids as much as they want too. Just put some restrictions after they've done their first time in the week like scaled down ilvl and no loot.

And fuck pheons. Dumbass currency.
I think the absolute WORST is when a MMORPG forces you to play in parties. It could be better if we had a solo mode for every content except the harder legion raids...
    >MMORPG forces you to play in parties.

That's why it's a MMO...
        I mean its not the first one i played and i think you got my point.
Plus, MMO refers only to the quantity of players and the type of servers it uses...
            Not really, I think almost every MMO, specially RPGs, requires some sort of player interaction or grouping. I think you are just playing the wrong game. If you don't want interaction, play an RPG.
Time commitment. I actually really really enjoy the game as a whole. It’s the most addicted I have been to a game since EverQuest. 

I quit about a month ago because, even tho I slimmed my roster down to 3, it was still too much time commitment. Actually - it’s more fear of not progressing and falling behind. 

All my other hobbies were falling to the wayside and only got touched if I absolutely had nothing to do in LA.
I don't like that the region I'm in (North America East) has been finicky and won't let me play it sometimes so I had to choose Europe West and create a whole new character and go through all the tutorials again and level up again. It's time-consuming and I just want to play my higher-level player
Tripod require pheon and its a gamble too
Pay to win
Pheons for stones, and no one enjoying content just rushing to do hw?
I think the biggest issue is new players joining the game and feeling overwhelmed, mixed with some gatekeeping issues, I think there should be a mentorship vendor/program to incentivize people helping newbies... and more boosts in general for new players like giving them free 4x3 engravings to keep permanently even for their first character or something.

The homework stuff doesn't bug me too much since I only do mine rested, to me I think bringing in new players is most important..
SMG addressing burnout by saying they think the state of the game is pretty good!

The future of the game is extremely concerning if SMG has nothing to say
The daily content (chaos/guardians/unas) takes too much time.

Im okay with running 18 raids (would prefer less ofc), but the daily content is what rly is depressing me the most.
Ability stones are straight from hell, dailies should be 1x chaos/guardian per character instead of 2x.
Players. So many people trying to lie that they know mechs. So many people with bad builds. So may people complaining about beeing gatekept... And then there is me. Above average player, with "show character info" that doesn't show it. But let me assure you, my dps uptime in valtan/vykas beats those with 1475+ 5x3 full relics. How do i know? Cuz I outdps them without full relic and grudge on my BonkyBoi >.> No way to show it, cuz "DENIED" :) That's why I love this game and hate it at the same time. Fighting is so smooth like it never was. It's like a Monster Hunter World to me - and then there are $wipe mechanics and honing, and pheons.  


Credit card is not the WEI >.>
Imo they should merge chaos dungeons and guardian raids. I mean South Vern already has that fancy dungeon you can do for rewards. It BASICALLY is chaos dungeon with "big bosses". Just use that as base. Could be similar map. Chaos dungeon with objective. Unlock these 3 gates or what ever. Kill 3 minibosses and then at the end selected guardian boss spawns which you need to kill. Then you get rewards. Each of those 3 minibosses could represent chaos dungeons existing portal system. There is different colors. When you summon said miniboss. You could see if the color of summoning portal and then it summons different types of minibosses.

Though problem here is that a lot of people like doing chaos dungeons solo. Technically here you could do it solo too, but then you wont be doing highest level "gate" as you most likely wont be able to solo said guardian at the end. Hence if you wanted to solo. You need to pick lower ilvl guardian.

So instead of doing calig chaos+guardian you would be doing something like deska if you wanted to solo it. You could also just stop on guardian raid and leave. Just getting rewards for "chaos dungeon"

This also promotes doing even this content as a group. There isnt portals either that require swapping maps so you cannot jail anyone here. Unlimited lives like with chaos dungeons. Just time limit. This also saves a lot of time. Especially if you have multiple alts.
6i habe 6 chars. There on : 1x1565 3x 1540 1x1530 1x1472 and now iam out. Content is borring and take to much Time for some gold…. Playing since Release..
Homework is fine but it's Hella boring af kind homework. They might as well add rewards for free cause guardians and chaos Dungeons waste my time.

Even boss Rush bore.

Chaos Line bore.

Chaos Gates bore.

Secret Maps bore.

World Bosses bore.

It's brain-dead content

I'd rather have more challenging homework with more rewards.
Game that needs too much time
the biggest problem is people thinking you need 6 characters to keep up with something
Amazon's google translate localisation and westernization in every case but one(pets) is a massive L for the game. I want good fantasy skins for my classes and the ones that fit that bill the most are the legendary skins with some exceptions.
Rmt,botters

But game itself? I would say if we had to do just 1 guardian and 1 chaos dung, would be sooo much better
Toxic and impatient dungeon run ers
The game just reeks of scummy eastern mmo practices. Tons of currencies, rng, fan service, etc
Among the biggest issues imo are:

Boring repetitive dailies  
Toxic elitist lobbies and players  
RMT  
Classes are not balanced
Too much rng
Support shortage

All my friends and recently my static have quit the game, i think i'm still playing cause there is no other "new mmo" to play. 
Blue Protocol may free me from Lost Ark, we'll see.
Either class imbalance, or waaaaay too much time required to do dailies
My biggest problem with it is how difficult it is to tell how experienced a player is at a raid. Because bussing exist, titles mean nothing nowadays. U can look for all the other things people gate keep with but its still such a risk to get jailed. I wish they made different titles all the way up to 100+ runs, and somehow remove bussing.

Indeed, the game just takes too much damn time that they should rename it Lost Life.

Some changes that would be good is combining chaos dung and guardian raids like cube and boss rush. They have you fight guardians on a huge map which is hardly used for anything besides running to guardian. they might as well add some mobs in it and have us do both at same time while also just reducing it to 1 time a day per character. Also guardians should have a chance to be dropped as mount in all honestly since some of them would be sick as mounts, but doubt they ever do that.

Another change is to legion raids that would just have you do highest ilvl raid you can do for gold. All you'd have to do in our current version is Brel for each character at i490+ and it just gives you x3 gold which would reduce time spent raiding. It makes no sense having high ilvl characters having to go back to do old raids that they sweep through like a chore besides time sink. If they are worried about gold inflation just have it where the box cost 3x gold as well as giving x3 resources. KR also has it where they aren't locked into doing only 3 legion raids a week so you can still go back and do old ones for cards or to help a friend out if need be.

Some small changes that would help out is automatically doing log in check for guilds for each character I log into while getting the highest reward for each quest for guild. Same with una tasks just accept the 3 unas I did prior day on that character so I can just go about business a little fast.

Personally, I hope this year they look into reducing time spent on the game and realize it's not healthy for players. It doesn't have to be these changes, but hope we get some before even more players quit cause of it.
    They straight up reject the idea of reducing chaos and guardians raid to 1/day already. Merging the 2 would be the most interesting option, but there’s no chance they will do it. Smilegate just doubles down on keeping player doing repetitive homework.
        Yeah, and it's causing the game to die. The amount of zero effort braindead content this game makes you do purely to generate currency and keep up with market prices is crazy.

It's legit like clocking in on a factory assembly line job just to pay bills. Hard to keep people playing who actually have a real job already.

I sometimes convert item cost into legion raid gold rewards. Like "huh, this 87 quality ring costs 10 Vykas..." - it's messed up once you consider the time spent on farming the gold. Unless you deeply enjoy the content even after 50+ repeats it's just a bad time that's also paid very badly.
            Korean games never change their mind b4 playerbase goes to shit. 

 Just look at KR with how they treat new players and Card set gatekeeping? 1490 express when current content is 1600+ and a scuffed LoS clone instead of making LoS 18 baseline or reworking cards completly. Ontop of being too greedy to give new players 5x3 for 2-3 months. 4x3 no LoS 20 roster ppl surely gonna get into brels. No rewards to help new players in raids etc.
                Yeah. It's a shame bc this game has such an amazing foundational setup of controls, art style and gameplay mechanics.

It's just so bogged down by legacy system clutter, upgrade system inflation and stubborn anti-player grind.

And on top, the grind for currency lacks sufficient break points, so new players at entry ilvl have to compete for party spots against established endgame players and their armada of alts.
                    The inflation part of upgrading is slowly killing my desire to continue even though i mostly enjoy the game. I'm only honing one brel character while generating mats from 4  characters regularly and its still not enough. Then we also have to generate mats for fuzion material while also spending gold to craft it. Why does it cost gold to craft something on top of the activity energy? The inflated cost of upgrading a character encourages RMT.
                    Anti-player while simultaneously being pro-revenue generating 🤣
                        The top 10% probably spends more than the remaining 90%.
                        Do you truly think that’s a contradiction? If so, you learned nothing from Diablo Immortal and all the other games that prioritize their monetization over longevity and offered quality. Lost Ark makes more money by squeezing idiots dry who drop the game soon afterwards than by cultivating a long term low spending player base.

So yeah, it is often very much anti player to be pro maximized revenue. Hell, it almost always is.
                I was always curious whether KR had a gatekeeping problem also, I guess it's just a problem of the game.. but they should figure out a way to get people to wanna help new players with some kind of reward or what not.
            Yeah and for people that have jobs you quickly realize you can buy 50k gold for 15 bucks.. just demotivates you even more to do homework. If I really liked the raids I’d log in to do those then buy 50k gold a week to keep up with progression. Boom just solved the time issue with lost ark.
        Its a calculated biz decision, if they give you those QOL changes, certainly they know ppl will not fury/frustrated swipe. The whole game is working on player mental, they want to infuriate player to swipe anyway possible.
        They did say that the amount of “chores” is what they feel to be the minimum level of effort in the last LOA-on
            If they actually were forced to play their own game I bet they would change their mind.
        Honestly after returning to the game in Nov, I'm ready to stop again. Raids are fun the first few times, but get boring after you do them even 3 or 4 times a week for multiple weeks.
        I like doing all of my chaos dungeons and guardian raids. I wish I had more stuff to do because I’m done in the first hour I play 🤷 I only have 3 characters rn
            Then create more characters

&#x200B;

Why are you for more homework ?
                Why so I can get burnt out and complain like everyone in this thread? Lol I will be soon with express pass. I like doing all of the daily stuff there’s nothing wrong with me enjoying it. You don’t HAVE to do it. You also get rested bonus…
        Players double down on doing it. You don't have to
            This attitude about content makes players realize their time is being wasted, though. The reward in proportion to time spent is just too low.

And once people realize this, they are just one step away from quitting.
                the biggest lost ark lie told by streamers: "Lost ark respects your time"
    >All you'd have to do in our current version is Brel for each character at i490+ and it just gives you x3 gold

Better yet remove 3 of the 6 gates.They realized its a bad idea and corrected it with akkan.

Gate 6 is a waiting game too which sucks balls when you're over geared.
    > realize it's not healthy for players

lol. they KNOW it's not healthy for players and are very much aware of the minimum time investment to get a return on the game. as i and many people have said from the beginning, the game is designed from the ground up to extract as much time and investment from players as possible. thinking they dont realize or dont know is very naive.
    Yeah I hate the idea that I still am compelled to run Valtan/Vykas. Like please I've done hundreds of times now i'm so bored of them BUT I CANT STOP BECAUSE THEY GIVE SO MUCH GOLD A WEEK.
    i agree with u on most points , except doing old raids , if u dont give intensive to do older raids will be abondoned . and other players will not be able to enjoy it , hence gatekeeping
reddit's anti-user changes are unacceptable
Yep

1) There's too much to do and not enough time to do it w/o sacrificing large parts of your real life. Every wipe in a homework raid is another few minutes of your time gone and further extending the amount of time you need to clear everything. Now, you don't "need" to clear everything but not doing so means you're most likely leaving gold on the table which leads me into my next point:

2) Too much focus around market simulator and not enough on actually playing the game. The game revolves around gold too heavily. Everything takes gold and the more progress you make, the more gold you need to sustain it all. The more progress you make the more silver you need which leads back to point #1 about homework. Sure you can do everything rested, but a) you still have to do it eventually and b) you're leaving loot on the table (i.e. silver which is needed in ludicrous amounts). Both points 1 and 2 then leads to:

3) Gatekeeping. You're short on time and you've got gold you still need to earn. All these raids requires you to pass Gate 0: the Party Finder. You can start your own raid but if you're near on-ilvl, doubtful many will want to join your party. The next gate you need to pass is 0.5: Finding supports so your raid can start. Once the raid starts, you have to hope that things go smooth and nobody is an imposter. Wiping once or twice due to bad luck is understandable. Wiping repeatedly at the same mech means your time has been wasted and you're probably back to the party finder. Not the worst if it was a DPS imposter. Fairly bad if it was a support imposter because now you're back to waiting for a support to try again. Whats the solution for the average person? Over-hone your toon so it looks more attractive. Get it 5x3 or better. What does all of that take? Points 1 and 2.

Bottomline, it's a vicious cycle of corporate greed trying to get people to swipe which leads to each point returning upon itself.
    I don't think someone summarized it any better than this
It's all calculated to make the most profit out of player's misery, and people believing That they will change that to " accommodate" us are on copium, sadly, (but I understand them)
I agree, and I only play 3 characters, 1475, 1460 and 1430. I do everything on rested but I am so fed up with wasting hours doing something with 0 risk reward, and then wasting hours looking for raids with other burned out people who are probably way more burned out than myself taking 1500s over me, and I don't blame them, because it's a symptom of the burnout and fomo and the daily and weekly repetitive homework is the root imo.
    I recently started the Witcher 3. It's like a breath of fresh air.  Looking forward to Blue Protocol and Diablo 4.

Some things I'm looking for in my next long term game: (1) near simultaneous content release {within 1 week allowing for different patch days}. (2) amount of daily/weekly required activities. (3) how much time do I spend looking at a loading screen.
        Me too actually, Witcher 3 is one of my all time favorites and I finally recently upgraded to a PC that game run the HD update pretty well.  A friend of mine got me to try Albion online and I'm liking it so far but not sure how much of a time commitment it is later on.
            Albione online is great. Played it for a long time.

The good thing about albion is that there is no time commitment unless you do zvz. And zvz is kinda meh, i never liked it.

So unless you do zvz, hell - you can just do whatever u want and whenever u want.

No dailies, no weeklies, nothing you " have " to do.

The only issue with the game is that when ur veteran, you dont have much to do. Its when u like level up everything u need, when ur so rich that loot doesnt really mean anything like it used to - eh.

I had lot of fun with the game. The potential for epic moments in it is high, especially if you play solo and if you use the game mechanics against others. Used to make some vids here and there - here one funny moment of baiting people :D [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpSYykrEQzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpSYykrEQzQ)
                hooly shitoe haha that looks fun. I'm actually great with that kind of expiration date, end-game in mmos is overrated.
I feel like the load time only makes this worse. Want to drop in for a quick chaos dungeon? Make sure you have at least 10 minutes for the game to load. After you're in the game, you need to load your character, and then load into the chaos dungeons as well. With an additional loading screen between the two dungeons. Then the loading screen when you're done with the second dungeon.
Exactly this. God forbid gamers have a life or want to try other games zzzz - I get they want people to keep player login count high, but ffs relax
The true asnwer. Others mention gatekeeping but gatekeeping is just a side effect of too much homework. Too much homework is the root of many issues in this game, gatekeeping included
    No it's the other way around. There is a lot of homework, but you can choose how much of it to do. The problem is there is pressure to do *all* your homework to keep up with gatekeeping standards so you can actually do fun content. If all kinds of players (hardcore, casual, anything in between) could fill their own parties without affecting each other I don't see a problem. But casual lobbies don't exist because all the supports go to juicer/hardcore lobbies. So I'm pretty sure support shortage is the root of the problem here.

Eliminating homework would just turn this game into a different kind of game, the kind that intentionally limits your grinding ability so no players can normally get far ahead (unless you swipe), and that's how they artificially keep the even ground. But that's a backwards way to go about solving the problem.
        I agree with you in that its gatekeeping that is the problem of pressure to do all the homework to keep up but disagree the root. The root of why gatekeeping exists is b/c they allow such a vast power differential between players who queue for the same activity. Match making in games that offer equalized / standardized characters doesn't face this same issue.

If Ilevel was used strictly to gain accesss to content and character systems were adjusted to give slight benefits. Gatekeeping would almost disappear because waiting for 5 minutes for someone who has slightly higher damage reduction/output no longer is worth the time cost. Along with a complete removal of a players ability to outgear content.
            Gatekeeping is the same as getting solar stuff and books in improving honing RNG, becuz it has no pity system, a group can fail infinitely etc. Higher ilevel/item =/= automatic clear but rather like a RNG boost in honing, it reduce the chance of failure.
     Homeworks are mat gating. Gatekeeping is essential to money making for the company, it pressures ppl to swipe in order to catchup.
I only raid with my main and after doing Brel G1 to G6 I just don't want to play for the rest of the day...
    I did brel 1-6 on my main last week and logged off for the week lol..
        Hahaha yeah I feel you, the game has started to feel more like a chore than anything else. 

I recently started playing Deep Rock Galactic and it's just been refreshing.
            I’ve been playing Sons of the Forest and valorant.
                Recently went back to eldenring ring. Lost ark is.
    Never done 5-6 brel, and don't feel like doing them cause doing 1-4 on 2 characters drains me for the whole week.
        Never seen 6 because the prog groups I've been in have abandoned in 5 pretty quickly.

        Have you even tried the class? And played it properly?
            [deleted]
                Sounds like an user problem.
This, 

I find most enjoyment in doing inferno mode, but if I want to also progress my character at a reasonable pace, it's either i do all my homework, which is boring, or do inferno and have fun. It's been a couple weeks now where I just skip doing dailies for the entire day on the days I run inferno.  5/6 of my chars have been full rested for a while now and it's the best balance i can do
I left due to too much FOMO.  I was doing only rested on all of my characters, but every reset night, I'd feel like I'd have to play for hours and hours and hours to complete every raid that I have on my 6 man 1460-1520 roster.    


Taking 10 minutes to log in (maybe not literally, but you know), so I can get my daily login bonus.  Just way too much FOMO.  I realized I was logging in just so I didn't fall behind.  I wasn't actually having fun doing dailies (especially una dailies).
Silver forces you to create alts imo.
    That's part of it. I actually like alts as most of the classes in this game are satisfying to play. My gripe is I'm starting to hate gearing them up because of abyssmal drops on accessories. Across 16 characters, i've probably got 3 very average drops that i'm currently using. Evertything else has had to be purchased off market/AH which also comes with the pheon tax.
Agree. They could at least utilise the rest bonus system to make 1 CD/Guardians spend all 100/100 rest bonus. It will become more like weekly stuff and players would get 50% rewards .
Every raid feels like homework now. Valtan, clown, vykas and Brel(1-6) feel like a chore to do.
The solution is to take alts and connect/tie to main and if main completes content (i.e., chaos dungeon, raids, etc) it should also complete on the connected alt.
Reminder that the homework keeps you from enjoying the rest of the game or helping your fellow players. Too much time spent trying to break from brel prison and clown (or so I hear, I'm not that far).
    "homework" IS the rest of the game.  
The game also pays you to do that "homework" so you can go back and help your fellow players with a good reason to do old content.
Currently hit burnout and took a week break. Spent all my gold on master summoner books and now know I have to farm a shit ton of gold for spec accessories that will be outdated in a month. 

My will to play is low right now (probably my fault for having 6 characters over 1490 not 1590). But I can't even be half assed at finishing the Brel title since there's just too many time sucks to get trapped in 5 for an hour.
    Relic accessories aren't outdated even in KR. Ancient accessories are a very minor upgrade over relic for their price.
        1 level of engravings (if you replace all 5 +3/+5 relics with +3/+6 ancient) and a little bit of STR/DEX/INT isn’t really a lot. Ancients don’t even give increased stats of crit/spec/swift. We will be good with relics for quite a long time
    U can go over 1590 o.o?
        Meant 1490 haha.
            Hahhahah mine all over 1520 but i only play 5 char and if i got time i do weekly on 6th one, and yeah getting title help a lot and its the diff betweeen 1 hour bre and 5 hour bre. It also help i got 2 sup which dont need much invest yet so i can pump everytjing into my dps.
    >now know I have to farm a shit ton of gold for spec accessories that will be outdated in a month.

Here is the neat thing: You actually DON'T know. Relic accessories are VERY much still relevant in KR. :)
This will never change lol the only way not to do hw is to swip and that's how they get revenue

They dont want to make it easier for f2p ppl. They need whales
yep. doing the same guardian 12 times a day is so fucking boring.

i only do my chores with rested and i'm getting sick of this game. can't wait for new POE season and new games
Chaos Dungeons, Guardian Raids, Daily Unas, Guild Tasks, Chaos Gates, Field Bosses, Adventure Island, Stronghold/Life Energy, Cube, Boss Rush, Weekly Unas, Challenge Guardian Raids, Challenge Abyssal Dungeons, Pirate Ship, Legion Raids 3x6, Rowen Weeklies (Happy Anniversary!) and of course, Limited-time Events! That's not including extra credit like Bussing, Guild Events, PvP, or going through that stack of Platinum Field Tickets!
Bump
This is just such a stupid take. YOU are the one doing 12 character on 1500+ and having heavily FOMO issues, SG nor AGS is forcing you to do that. I play fucking 4 chars and one of them is 1500+ and I have zero problems to keep up with others even my friend which plays lesser chars stopped for a while playing lost ark and started now again a few week ago and I dont know if he is a wizard but he is close to my GS and I haven’t stopped playing.
    The game does not even give you enough silver to hone if you just have one main.  And as you hone the alts you dig yourself into a deeper hole.  It's absolutely by the game's design.
        The fuck am i reading? Then you and many other do definitly something wrong. My main is 1560 with 1x 1460 1x 1445 and 1x 1415 im sitting on close to 120m silver and 1,17m raw gold + over 500 L Shard Bags. And I haven’t even spent money dunno what u guys do wrong especially those who swipe too.
            You have four characters? l2read and stop being so madge?
                Yes and I did my first alt when my main was around 1490 out of boredom even without them I would have more than enough silver. Then you should stop spreading missinformation and quit the game or learn how to spend your recourses or stop getting catched by FOMO. If you want everything in a week like many of the other whiny guys here then play a shooter or smth but not a MMO.
Yea I quit last week as I just could not do anymore chaos/guardians/boss rush/cube. I did brel 1 to 6 and felt like ok nothing else coming. Best to quit now as I cannot see myself doing hw just to go up a few ilvls for brel hm or akkan.
Just to get the bossrush tickets, I ended up having 21 characters and yes, burnt out by myself.

But the community affected me as well. I'm having a high roster of 234 so far by just doing tower, daily, weekly stuff, recently did learn Valtan but not vykas.   
Community wise being mocked for having high roster and still wanting to learn the fight because how dare I not being an expert and not cheating into reclear groups because I don't want to hinder them to progress.  


So I was looking for a guild. "Don't burn out yourself, just play like you feel like it" 2 hours later "omg people we should clear brel g2 finally, we've been trying since two weeks, you should be willing to spend 6 hours a day 3-4 days a week so we can finally progress. Oh, and you. You didn't do Vykas, Clown and Brel so far, so prepare for Vykas mechs, learn clown mechs and do the marios in perfection. What? You didn't have the time to learn prokel? How dare you?

And the explanations. "We are running down, to the left over the outside to the inside, straight back  up, in an ellipse straight to the middle and back to the left where we run to the right again" one fail after "mimimi why didn't you do what I just said" sorry? Was trying to follow but honestly, that explanation was terrible.  


Valtan wise with randoms was finishing me off. So many groups where supports are dying first by falling off the map going on a insulting rampage when others were dying in ghost phase and quit spamming after the first wipe and so on. 

I just quit raiding by myself and just buy carrieruns now. Much less troubles, less insultings and I am having fun again. Not doing all the homework and just play how I feel like it.

But one big issue is honing as well. And don't get me started with tripods, when you fail 15 times the 25% chance in a row. I feel like the displayed chance doesn't match the actual chance, even if it might be correct. But RNG just hates me.
Right now I'm 1560 and I've really enjoyed the game, but if I was just starting the game and someone recommended me to pay for a bus, I would have quit right away.
    Yeah I was amazed when ATK was talking about how he recommended his friend to take a bus. Like bruv you play 200 chars and won´t even help a brother out? Can´t imagine any1 sticking around if they aren´t into it or have friends helping
        Yeah I was playing with a friend and I would not raid with my Paladin to raid only with him to make it easier for him to get accepted, because I've been in that spot sometimes that my friends would just go "Oh just get to X level by yourself" then why am I even bothering playing the game if I'm going to play by myself?

He still quit because he didn't enjoy how the legion raids work (weekly homework).
            That's basically where I'm at. The weekly homework doesn't feel great after beating it so many times. It was fun beating valtan close to ilvl, but now it's just boring, and you end up spending more time in PF because people still gate keep.
    This is why I left my last guild
Exactly the issue I‘m facing as returning player with only 1380
Someone said homework above. Gatekeeping is in part due to how much homework there is. Your time is limited because of the homework which makes gatekeeping almost required to complete content quickly enough.

Weekly and daily content required to complete in order to keep up, at least in my opinion, is one of the largest contributors to gatekeeping.
    In my opinion learning parties are inpractical bc of lock outs. I have plenty of time, but hosting a learning party is a huge time commitment and I'd rather just join and help out for about an hour and not deal with being stuck on gate 2 if the group disbands. 

Let us repeat raids and do something about bussing game would be way better.
        Bussing is interesting. Its value is huge, you can double your gold intake by bussing. The problem is that it essentially ruins the new player experience completely.

I’m not against bussing but I also think that its gotten out of hand, as well, which has also contributed to gatekeeping.
            I ran Argos bus the other day, and one of the passengers was a 1370 mokoko bard with an okay build, and she played with us doing normal bard stuff and did the mechanics too. So sad that she had to pay 1500g for the privilege of just doing the raid normally as a new player. And "funny" thing is that she was lucky to not get gatekept from even joining the bus, some drivers I ran with refused to take mokokos because they don't know how to use AH (fair enough).
                Isn’t there also a trusted status restriction on the AH? So it is reasonable to think that a mokoko player wouldn’t have a trusted account. So they may know how to use AH but can’t? This is what I have heard, I don’t keep track of these things though.
            Well I'm in the opinion that buses are fine (I bus from time to time). I just want unlimited entries for raids cuz I want to do them when I'm bored. I don't want lock outs. 

But unlimited entries= unlimited buses so that's what they'll have to tackle. Or tbh if it's unlimited entry there might be too much competition for bussing and prices would be down?
                Heck, some players might just start joining old raids for fun or even carrying friends or guildies if they could run the same raid multiple times on the same character. People freak out about unlimited runs = unlimited busses, but it really weakens the power of a busser when other people can just fill that slot.
                >But unlimited entries= unlimited buses so that's what they'll have to tackle. Or tbh if it's unlimited entry there might be too much competition for bussing and prices would be down?

Unlimited busses capitulates on itself. Prices would become extremely low and filling a bus would take even longer than it does now because of how many other lobbies there would be.
                No lockout are coming in the next KR update right? So next year you’ll have no lockouts lol
                    No there's still lock outs lol. They just removed the 3 legion raids limiter. You can still only enter valtan once per week with one character.
                Final fantasy ran into this issue and aside from their content being _usually_ harder to bus for large numbers, what it simply does is make the reward structure go like this:

- If you clear with all 8 players new to the raid or haven't consumed their weekly lockout, 2 chests of loot.

- if 1-4 player has already cleared this week, only 1 chest drops.

- If 5-8 players have already cleared, no chest drops.

You can just do your own 2 chest run as a seasoned player then simply join a friend in a learning or prog party, they'll get 1 chest or zero chest, but clearing the raid gives a guaranteed drop which counts towards their gear progression. The chests are more akin to the box we buy after raid clear from the side menu in lost ark.

Would people be against getting a vykas clear if it only meant they don't get to buy the chest and double their wings? I think a lot of people would be, and it's a shame that Lost Ark's answer isn't to strike a middle ground but rather just declare open warfare against the idea of player choice repetition.
        \+10000 learning party means that you risk that your character won't finish the raid at that week and you lose gold. you sacrifice your own resources to teach someone. they put a design to reduces buses and in return make the learning partis way more difficult. 

I wouldn't mind join learning party on character I already did the clear with and just joining for help but this is not the case
        Just give people ability to run more legion raids without lock out, but you get very little in loot and your character is lowered to lowest ilevel requirements so no bus
    They can introduce extra rewards for having a mokoko in your raid, and that’ll be solved
        Don't worry I'll take that juicy compensation as I boost my good mokoko friends sjsjsggsv and kdkfllflf
            They’re already getting boosted, its irrelevant.
                but now other will be incentivised to boost too with that compensation. yum yum
                    The bots are already paying really well, people who dont care are already incentivized.

You’re willfully ignoring that this allows many mokokos to actually get to play the game, be helped and feel like part of the community, your “worries” are already happening.
        Good idea and they give mokoko status to players who haven't played for a month or two months
        Depending on the raid, time to complete with someone you have to teach or carry, etc. The gold value is anywhere between 4,500 to 8,000. Unless there is a way to compensate based on time spent in a raid with a mokoko and reward based on how far above the average completion time it is, it isn’t feasible. 

I’m not advocating for gatekeeping. I just don’t think any rewards they would be willing to add, would deter a lot of people. Especially when you consider new raid tiers, new soft reset gear. That Vykas with a mokoko could cause so much time to lapse a persons alt might not get a Brel clear because that person only has 2-3 hours on that Sunday. This is essentially allowing a mokoko to grief someone elses roster progression because of time jailge.

Unfortunately, that is how the game is inherently designed.
Honestly, this, which leads into another topic: the shitty elitist player base. 

They're a small fraction of the community, but man are they loud as fuck.
as someone that recently came back, the constant quitting before even giving an attempt in matchmaker is really maddening.
    Just a quick advice, never run content through matchmaking except maybe abyssal dungeons. You will get matched with people who juat wanna be carried, and they will usually ask to quit dungeon as soon as they say there is no juiced character in the party.
        My problem right now (just hit 1400ilvl) is that matchmaking groups usually can't clear, and pf groups are either busses or reject my applications, wanting higher ilvl.
            Stick to yoho, trust me.
                Not sure what you mean
                Deska is way easier and I get much better teammates too. When I was doing yoho we would constantly fail. Fuck that
                    ...you can't do deskaluda at 1400. Velganos is cancer in a pug setting. So stick to Yoho until 1415.
        yah, I'm getting the picture. so cancerous
        i actually had a 1490 in my party that did less damage than my 1410. Ended up carrying them. They were fully maxed on Argos gear (no valtan or vykas relic) so I assume it was one of the early whale swipers.
The game design punishes you for helping each other. Got another 5+ characters of raids, then card runs, then islands, and don't forget the time to do stuff you want in or out of the game. And when you fail a raid it costs money to get more supplies to go again.
This is largely due to how difficult it is to gear up to the communities standards.

It's pretty bad in WoW as well for the same reasons.

A game like FFXIV where day 1 of raiding you can be raid ready extremely quickly and has hard ilvl caps on current content has very little gatekeeping because the only thing to consider is player skill as the gear is basically a non-issue and class balance is ridiculously good.

Going from a 4x3 to a 5x3 in Lost Ark especially for newer players that don't already have grudge or another leg book is insanely expensive. Then you still need to hone well above what is required for the raid to be accepted. It's just bad game design at the end of the day. Nobody should be trying to follow WoW's model of designing a game based on toxicity.
Preach, teach new players how to play the game and the content so they can teach others further down the line
I´d spend 3x the time in a raid helping a new person if I could get 3x the amount of my raids done.

Or just in general let me q 6x clown for my roster on the same char. 

idk give me options.
    nah. double or triple the gold earned from raids and reduce gold earning characters proportionally.

sg will never tho. they want us to grind and when we get sick of the grind it incentives spending real money to skip the grind. converting f2p into p2p is the endgame for sg and let be honest that shit works so well.

also reducing gold earning characters and boosting gold per raid will never fly because building characters also generates profits for them.  the game is designed to min max profits
Bump
The game is forcing you to gatekeep others because there is too much homework in this game. 

You dont have time to help others because you have so much to do and your time is limited. Its the game's fault.
[deleted]
    There aren't many learning lobbies. It's not that deep, my guy.

Sure, there's some that want a free carry, but these are mostly not new players. New players tend to still be enamored of the game, have less homework, and want to actually experience the raid.

Even on ilvl parties gatekeep.
This
I felt that one brother I did my first vykas and I did pretty good on studying it but the one thing I didn't look at was calling in or out after blue black orbs and got flamed for wasting people's time and that I should join a learning party so I made a learning party went 2 hours without anyone joining ):
Everything revolves around gold too much so it makes players feel like they should be maximizing their gold returns each week through raid homework.
Yup, thats why the best thing that could happen to this game is a total relaunch and make it a real action rpg with loot and diverse content... Make raids an option for endgame loot but not THE only way. 

but this will never happen because it goes against what the korean studio wants from this game. They would need to practically relaunch the game with a new vision.

At this point they are waaaay too buried in their current game model to do a change this drastic.
    the grind will always exist so their is an incentive to pay to skip it.
Hate both. Boring asf.
With AGS tweeting a cartoon of a mokoko riding a bus with the text on it something like "tip your driver", I'm not expecting anything to change anytime soon.
    I mean, even if AGS hate  buses is on SG to do anything about it. They can sugest it but then all regions will need to remove busing and that's something that will upset a lot of people as well.
        But based on the tweet AGS doesn't hate busses. For anything to happen AGS needs to think it's a problem enough to bring it up with SG.  SG isn't watching the 'global' region. Based on the tweet it seems they're fine with the status quo.

Edit: they do all kinds of things that upset a bunch of people. Look at pheongate. There were people complaining about the golden frog issue handling.
            Busing is the way to retain new player to give them hope and progression to look forward to, of cuz smilegate likes it and encourages it, more players retained more possiblity of swipe, why not. A raid structure like lost ark, if without busing will die out pretty fast.
                Or you create an incentive that encourages seasoned players to help new players. FF14 has a random queue that gives extra rewards, so you queue into low level dungeons but get the same rewards. A mentorship program could be added to the game. FF14 has that as well, and mentors get rewards. I've heard not all people who sign up are good mentors, but the company is trying.
                    Idk what smilegate will do, certainly thats possible if player count start to thin out. All raid mmo goes throughthe same thing/path, the other easy way is to move group wipe to hard/hell level, like different tier with different loot.
        Yeah, people shit on AGS too much sometimes. Sure, they're to blame for quite a few things, but SG also deserves a lot more criticism for the shit they're responsible for.
            I think it's fine to criticize AGS in this case. AGS could have tweeted "we're actively working on the bussing issue with SG." Instead they tweeted a cartoon that said "tip your driver".
                Well, we don't know the nature of their contract with SG, and will likely never will.

Maybe they're in a position where they can't even mention it. I wouldn't be surprised, tbh.
Your 2nd paragraph has all the reasons that I also hate the amount of bussing going on in this game. I can't imagine being a new player who does the grind to hit a certain ilvl for a new raid and gets told to take a bus because nobody wants to play legitimately with you without payment. I would quit immediately.
[deleted]
    Reading all this makes it painfully clear you only play p2w mmos with mechanics in place to punish free players. The worse part is how willing you are to guzzle it all down, as are many others I'm sure.
        [deleted]
            I never said that you were wrong. I said that it's clear you only play p2w mmos that are designed to punish f2p players and are willing to guzzle it down. But that's just the state of anything f2p. That's why I stick to ff 14. I pay 15 a month and play a solid mmo that respects my time, doesn't punish new players, and puts everyone on the same playing field with no monetary advantages besides buying level ups.
The reason I came here is because I wanted to see the state of things because Lost Ark DOES have pretty damn good combat, visuals, and presentation and I wanted to see if it was worth it to come back. Your absurd comment, among other things, just made me feel gross and not want to even log in again. So back to ff 14 I go.
Yeah I thought i would hop into a Vykas hard lobby as a 1500+ to help out some 1460s get it done. I think we waited for almost an hour for supports as people trickled in and out. The game is honestly hopeless in this regard, and not going to get any better.
    Unfortunately, the 1460s in the current game aren't as skilled or geared as the 1460s when vykas was just released. Even on my paladin I ended up getting jailed trying to help 1460s 'cause they didn't do enough damage. Two people did 50% of the dps in gate 1, but gate 2 was the real jail when ppl just kept dying to stupid things. In the end, they got dps checked hard.
I definitely see where youre coming from BUT you get runes, vitality potions, skill points etc from unas, rapports, and all the different collectibles. Yes if u dont have those, you can still do the raids completely fine. But they are still big part of the game if you want to min max your roster
    Yeah but realistically speaking thats just the incentive you have for doing all of that stuff , like every single one of those you already get as your character level up and gating those behind doing horizontal is well as i said just incentive so you do that stuff ,so its nothing unique ,and rapport and collectibles just give stats and barely nothing else besides map percentage ,and the other collectibles are more of the same , they are just systems for the lulz and barely make a difference besides skillpoints and runes you can alocate them anywhere else they dont need to be where they at and the game would still be the same ,so thats what i mean , when you really look into it beside the raids and playable characters everything else is just a shell to say you have something to do
        It’s still really important and some classes are pretty poor or below their ceiling without out it, if the skill screen load out was shown then I’d deny a lot of gunslingers for not having close to max skill point or lunar reapers for not having all their wealth runes. It’s not essentially but you really gimp your damage on some classes without some of the horizontal prog to the point where you do way less damage on some classes
            Yes but my point is , those skillpoints can just be givem to you as you level up , the so called "skill point" potion doesnt need to exist just like all of the other stats they give u as potions , they already give you stats , the other couple can be just included there ,its just a fancy way of getting them and thats it, runes as well they can just give them to you by doing guardians and chaos and that it ,the horizontal its just a fancy system to get them ,or the runes could just no exist and the abilities give more of what the runes already give and thats it ,or you can reduce stagger on bossed so you dont need overwhelm and classes can tranform faster so you dont need wealth , its just a fancy system of stuff you already have to keep you occupued but its not necessary because you already have it
                So do you want non-raid content to matter or not? They have to have some reward for horizontal or else as you said it doesn’t matter. I don’t understand what you want if you don’t want the game to just be raids but also don’t want non-raid content progression to have power rewards? Some classes need those rewards or they have shit damage in raids so it’s not like those rewards don’t matter. Sure it’s a ‘fancy’ way of getting them but this is literally how video games work, you play them to progress, it’s like you guys have never played a video game before lol
                    Bruh how are you so dense lol , my point is ,the only reason horizontal matters its because of the rewards , but seeing it from outside the only reason horizontal gets done are the skillpoints and some runes , as a whole horizontal doesnt matter and the game would still be the same without it , im not arguing if the stuff matters or not ,of course skillpoints matter  my point is either you do it good or you dont and horizontal content is done like shit and behind it they are gating vital resources that they can just give in any other way and bot lose vita development time on horizontal content they dont know how to do ,of course i would like horizontal content to matter z but i want it to matter in a gameplay way , not matter just because it gives u skillpoints and other stuff that its only there to progress on other horizontal stuff that is at best half baked
                        If you are trying to say horizontal is shit and only required because of the skill points and runes then sure. Considering that there isn’t much required horizontal content and most people don’t play the horizontal content past what is required I doubt they will change it up much and just continue with adding small islands and events in the manner they have been doing
                            I know they will not change it because they dont need to , my point is the horizontal content is pointless and the game doesnt need it , it would still be the same game or better and the only reason it its there its because losr ark wants to mimick games like diablo and poe eithout understanding it is neither
                    They should just make side content give cosmetics IMO.  You need to do quite a bit of (IMO boring) side content to max out on skill pots.  Uninteresting side content is not why I play MMOs.  I'm a min maxer though, so I dredged through them.
Which is player driven. Everyone knows it's the opposite, the longer you wait the easier it is to hone/gear.
True. It was really hard for me to continue playing when all my friends rushed off to other guilds to progress through the content faster which led them to sitting around waiting for the next content update while I'm still enjoying taking my time.
    The best part is not having to do the whole learning prog. Getting to ilvl for raids 1 month after it comes out means that there are more players who know the mechanics. I've experienced learning runs and the same person was dying on the same mechanic for 2 hours+. Some people are just extremely bad at learning mechanics.
Hope you come back someday :) The game def is grindy but it can still be a lot of fun. Gatekeeping sucks though
    Thanks brother, 
I truely hope so aswell. 

I only reached around Ilvl 1405, and by the time I got there nobody took raiding seriouse and I could only "progress" through buss...  

I'm holding my fingers
        When I started playing the game back at launch I only had one character that I slowly pushed, I was among the last people to reach T3 of the people that started at launch because I took my time searching mokkokos and doing all the collectibles (also I changed servers and character before I reached lvl 50 too, so I missed all the Argos fiasco that people cried about)
I played only one character up until brel release almost, my character was always ready for content on release., now I started playing multiple characters but honestly it's possible to play slowly and be ready for content, it's just your gold income that will be a bit lower but other than that it's possible to play less then 6 characters.
If gold is really an issue and the feel of slower progress compared to others good solution is to just park alts at 1415-1445 range and just do raids with them and nothing else.
I don't have a +20 weapon right now so I'm "technically behind" based on some no lifers but I know I'll get there soon enough when it becomes relevant or needed, right now having a +20 brell stuff is only for flex and not needed at all for any current content.
Both are intertwined, if you didn't need to do so much homework to keep up you wouldn't mind taking a new player in raids. Without reducing homework gatekeep will only remain and make worst, specially after Brel HM.
That’s why it’s best to play 6 different classes. An example is LoL where you do the same thing every match, but to change it up, you play a different champ or role
    While I see where you’re coming from it doesn’t apply to Lost Ark. Raids are literally sequenced with very small windows of variability. MOBAs require the same map because of the seemingly infinite combinations and interactions between heroes and game outcomes (and quite literally everything in between). So alts don’t achieve the same effect, it’s just different colours, positioning and tempo to do the identical dance 6x.
        I agree with this. LoL also has different runes/items that slightly diversify your champs playstyle and is still viable. There's really only a 2-way deviation in builds for lost ark chars and more often than not, there is a theoretical best build that significantly out-paces the other.
    Maybe at starts true but after a while you get used to character gameplay and they are feels the same .I can do chaos -guardians while watching movie :D Even better when playing paladin I can do all raids watching second monitor.
    Nah PvP games can't be compared. Every game feels different because your opponents are playing differently and they're picking different champions. Also the game is competitive so that spices up every match. Lost Ark becomes repetitive even if you have 6 different classes and the fact that you have to play 6 different classes just to 'fend off' the monotony of doing the same thing is indicative of the game's terrible gameplay loop.
It would also help with gatekeeping if you dont have to depend on all 7 other players being good.
    Yeah I think it would
I know they're meant to be anti-bussing, but there's got to be another way to approach it.
    There is a very simple approach, don't let people overgear content so much (ilvl cap on content) and then you can create less raid wipe mechs along with stricter dps checks and busing with a low amount of drivers instantly becomes unviable and only actual great players would be able to pull it off. ATM any average Joe can bus since they are so far ahead they barely take damage and just delete bars.

That is my biggest grip with LA (besides the obvious of too much dailies/weeklies). It is also what makes more than half of the classes "bad" because only burst builds really perform well in such short encounters, it trivializes content so quickly it is ridiculous. Some people already are miles ahead in item level BEFORE a new raid drops.
Load times for sure is a huge negative that seems to be very overlooked by AGS.
This would increase gatekeeping. People would just say “don’t play on this character get on your main and just claim the gold on it”. Did you even think this through
    with that logic everything that gets added to the game is somehow increasing gatekeeping even when it's just 100 weapon dmg from some special mokokoseed found somewhere in the early area and can never be found again after you passed it. Like bro stop that shit. How do they even find out that you have characters better geared than the character you're applying with? We dont have a user database yet.

If you can ''Share'' every single drop from raids(Accessories, tokens ect + without a pheons cost) with your roster, you can easily gear your alts up with your main and if you feel like playing your alt, just go with it.

Have you ever throught about to create your own party/raid? Because if you really wanna play your low geared alt in the current high end content, then it's you trying to get carried and not everyone else gatekeeping you.
        Wait is there actually a special Mokoko seed early game that you are supposed to find? 😂
Prepare yourself for 6 months of homework just for 3 gates Akkan that will be fun to prog for a week or two before you put it on farm.
![gif](giphy|BVTvkXj6HHdbBV9t7i)

what bot prevention?
    the market cap and buying cooldown
This is the only mmo I’ve ever played. Could you explain what other games do do end game that isn’t repetitive content? And share examples
    14 has tons to do besides endgame raiding. that has also nothing to do with gaining power. rouge like dungeons, leveling the 19 different classes on a single character, collecting glamour (skins), housing, crafting and gathering with actual systems behind them and tons of other stuff that isnt homework or some weekly lockout
    In other mmos you could go to several older maps to farm something for example. But in this gane since the loot progression AND gold is gated in raids, theres nothing else to do but to raid. You cant go and farm a certain boss or a certain dungeon because everything is worth nothing in comparison to raid loot and gold.

The world is vast and beautifull but since drops are non existent (this game is not a conventional action arpg of loot collecting), you end up standing in town waiting for a queue. 

Unas, island souls etc doesnt count because those are collectibles, you dont earn thibgs that you can sell in the store to progress exploring the game. All is funneled in raids. 

This limits the experience greatly and missuses the vast amount of content this game has in terms of exploration and diversity. It just pleases hsrdcore raid players, which is not innerhently bad, but it turns out bad when is your only gameplan to keep people in.
        I disagree focusing in end game raiding is bad for Lost Ark, if anything is one of the strongest points and the biggest appeal of the game. The issue is how hard and grindy can get to progress specially after Brel Raid, the cost of honing is insane and the only way to do it is doing homework with 6 characters every day.   


That's the biggest flaw in my opinion, and what make focusing in more horizontal content pointless since the grind make player ignore it. If you could gain gear progression or have a true reset in gearing this wouldn't be an issue but SG refused out of fear to do so, so they keep delaying the matter and making things worst. There is a reason even in KR people is tired of doing chaos and guardian for 4 years non stop, having no alternatives to progress towards the raid is soulcrushing.
            Players ignore horizontal content not because of the grind, but Because the return of time invested on it is puny in comparison to the raid benefits.

Why would you invest time in content outside the raids of it is not only time consuming but also borderline useless in comparison?

On top of that, add the raid problem that you just mentioned. At this point the powercreep in gear is unberable already in global, and in korea is beyond it.
    My best example would be WoW (a subsciption based) where you can go back to older raids from previous Expansions to farm for free skins/transmog, pets, and mounts for the Cosmetic End-game.
        So repetitive content locked behind a weekly limited rng wall for 0 gain?
            If you don't want free stuff from easy soloable voluntary content, then don't do it? I prefer that over the constant raiding hamster wheel for Gold that is Lost Ark.
                You tried giving an example for non-repetitive content and I pointed out that it is and worse then you what you were making it out to be.
                    It is non-repetitive because it is voluntary, i.e. you don't have to redo old content for cosmetic stuff if you don't want to. It is a repetitive chore if you make it become a chore. In Lost Ark, you need gold for nearly everything and the only way to get gold is through Time (Legion raids) or Money (Swipe).
                        It is repetitive if you want to get the thing you are hunting for which is the reason you are doing it. Just because its voluntary doesn't mean it is not repetitive and still has weekly lock outs and RNG behind it which means you could possibily never get those items.
                            Grinding cosmetics is repetitive anyways. Can sugar coat it, but it'll still be repetitive grinding. Tried a game where one outfit was locked at an abysmal 1% drop rate. Ran the dungeon 330 times for it. 

Swapping to support main instead is less stress. Easy to get into lobbies regardless. Have 3 supports and 3 alt dps. Can always use the supports to funnel the mats into 1 dps if I want to anyways.
    Best example I can think of is gear appearance: LA - Cash shop/Market purchase of Cash shop items OR spam chaos dungeons and pray you get lucky for 1 skin per class.

WoW -  you have almost 20 years worth of gear appearances obtainable from pretty much everything that you can use to make your character look unique and completely badass. 

I love T2 DB armor I'd love to be able to tmog it as my gear skin.
The homework is annoying, but I agree, the biggest disappointment with this game is that spending time in the gorgeous world is next to useless once youve gotten a certain level of collectibles.
    So, just like WoW and FFXIV.
        Yeah I feel like that is a problem for most of the popular MMOs, you are in the same place most of the time and do the world exploration a few times and never look back. So a lot of beautifull maps and zones are there rotting since they are obsolete.
        Maybe its a problem with the genre, I haven't played those. Im just saying how I feel about lost ark 🙂
Agree, raids are fine but it's literally a chore at this point
    As and endgame option is a greatvidea to have difficult raids... For the people that like raiding,

But gating everything behind raids is stupid korean lazy design.

What a waste of potential on a game.
        Nail on the head mate, raids are fine but shouldn't be the single point of progression,
It is a mmo and even then you can do everything solo except raids and even then some of them can be solo carried. I don’t get this comment……
    Most mmo has content for both group and solo, the true is solo biased player base is much bigger then group in general. When the game decays, you will have dufficulty to find 8 person to do raid, and the players leaving isnt those got gatekeeping but those experieced one got burnout, this is how raid die, lost ark isnt the first but wont be the last neither.
        Buddy, it is a mmo. It is made for people looking to interact with other people. You can’t solo current raids or dungeons in WoW and FFXIV and are ilvl capped in those games too. This genre caters towards people who want to play with others, this isn’t made for solo players who have every other genre and game heavily catered towards them. MMO’s that cater to a more solo style is what kills the game cause that makes less interaction between people and no connection to the game and they just leave. Go play Genshin, PoE, or Albion or countless other titles made for you.
            Raid itself cant be substained once players count dips below critical mass, to survive it has to have  some solo content in place, or constantly reinvent the game, like battlefield or CoD.
                If a MMO doesn't have players then it is a dead game and even solo players are going to leave cause then there is no economy or no reason to play. Catering towards solo players in a MMO is the quickest way to kill MMO's cause solo players don't have any commitment and move on to new trends fast and have no connections to the community. Idk how u fail to understand the niche MMO's provide....they are not made for the solo player and never were lol
Go play a SP game then?

Why would an MMO be designed for players to do things solo?

    Right
    lol then he swiped his ass off because I started 2 months ago and I have been playing everyday for 10+ hours and I just got to 1500 today. Swiped ALOT and I had help too. Let’s not even talk about the fact that his roster level is probably 100 and he will be gatekept unless he’s in a group
You CAN play one character and even only play its 1-2 highest raids (and mostly-unrested chaos dungeons and guardian raids, and some of the chaos gates, adventure islands and other stuff) - that way you can make just about enough gold, honing materials and gems to keep progressing the character to be ready (on minimum ilvl and gems lvls) for every new raid's release, just can't really be overgeared for the new raid and can't spend substantial amounts of gold on non-honing/gearing stuff such as crystalline aura, skins and pets, need to make do with the free ones (or spend real money), and can't take too large or frequent breaks (but can take a couple of days away from the game now and then).
    that is absolutely not true.

I only spent money on the two express event passes, I have about 3.5m worth of stuff to sell, I am currently 1576 ilvl and almost full level 9 gems.

I only play one main in a realistic manner. I also got a bard that's 1460 that I may or may not do raids with. I also got a second sorc that I will very rarely do any raid with, usually only argos and I got a reaper that I only buy buss from once in a while. Their only real purpose is lopang when I need silver and peyto/fernanda card packs. I do not run guardians or chaos with them except in the very rare occurence (I may have ran 2 turtles in the past month).

Alts are NOT even close to required.
        Agreed. Only have one main 1560 and I have a 1460 bard that I never play. You don’t need alts.
        Ok, then maybe there is even more leeway than I thought, the players I know (who have been able to catch up and keep up playing 1 character) started playing a month after launch and spent 0 money, but my point was also that alts are NOT required to progress main, they are just required if one wants to play more, have more bifrosts / card-buying characters, and such stuff.
            Ahh yes the "I play 6 characters and I don't have any time" crowd. It's so ironic that they chose to make and play that many characters when it's not necessary.
                I choose to play multiple characters because I can and want to, I am aware I am this way actually less efficient and progress more slowly (and would only maybe be more efficient if I played an unreasonable number of hours per day or if I played in the most unfun ways) - my brother and I started at the same time, he plays half the hours per week than I, and has progressed much more quickly than I, in ilvl and even in horizontal content (in everything except roster lvl), in big part because he plays only one character. Once I finally decide on 1-2 classes I want to play the most or/and once I'll have less time, I'll likely play only 1-2 characters, if I don't quit raiding / quit entirely (by) then.
You don't necessarily need alts, they just help with gold income, silver income, and fun. I only push with bound leapstones and I reached Valtan a week after release, Vykas on release, Clown on release, and I had two chars ready for Brelshaza on release. 

>The fact that we are still doing a year-old raid weekly is very dumb. There should've been a system where if you get your gear from the raid then you don't have to do it anymore, you can still do the raid but only for fun and not be something you MUST do. 

I don't understand the system you're proposing or why you even need one. If you want to do the raid, do it. If you don't want to do it, don't do it. I don't like Kakul, I do Kakul on 1 char only for the mats. Rarely do I do 18 raids weekly.
The fact that we'll still being doing Valtan/Vykas for probably another whole year should tell you something.
Yikes, disconnects are probably a you issue at this point. And there are way more prevalent issues than bots, asking users to do 2 guardians and 2 chaos each day make people quit way before any bots do
    Yikes, can you please explain what happened to me and my group here then.  
Also, none of us 8 got any re-entry ticket. Yikes.

        O no, you missed out on 5 Brel horns in the 15th week you’re definitely gonna quit the game now I’m sure. What makes people quit the game are the endless chores and burnouts. This is one unfortunate thing that happened to you that impacts maybe 15 min of your time, chores are 2-3 hours a day
            O no my bad, I guess I didn't read the title of OP's post and that disconnects that are surprisingly happening until now is **NOT** a big issue.

Imagine reading. Yikes.
    Kek, op asked for biggest issues and disconnects are hands down one of the biggest issues since it has and will continue to actually ruins players' immersion/experience/raids.

Meanwhile you on the other hand think 2 guardians and 2 chaos a day is a big issue when players can opt to skip them or use rest bonus. Imagine not using rest bonus in 2023. Players are given an option when it comes to homework, but they can't do anything when it comes to the servers/disconnects XDDDD
I don't understand this either... Yea the daily grind is ridiculous but we have a ton of content... What they should do tho is reduce the shard/honing cost on the top end after brel hm comes out. The grind is ridiculous and i dont think NA has the patience to wait 4-6mo for akkan.
We got wayyyyyyyyyyy more content than they did during the time we’ve had lost ark, what are you even talking about. In 1 year we got as much as they did in 3 years
The problem is also thtt the game revolves around supports but there are only 2.

You can of course do raids without supps but it takes more time and coordination. And it seems raids are now designed with supports in mind. 

There is also a missed opportunity with Fighters, you are telling me we have 5 fighters all damage dealers but coming from a land where ki , meditation, balance, etc. is the norm there is no fighter that fulfills the support role by taking care of their teammates with their spiritual background/knowledge? Kinda like Karma from LoL,  Anikka is basically Ionia.

The Summoner could have a third class engraving being a support role. Kinda how Azena/Innana, help you in the story. Many creatures at her command and all they do is attack but not protect/support the team.
    They kinda wanted to rework soulfist into dps/support hybrid like gunlancer year ago but it was 30% dps nerf for some marginal support benefits and really not popular with really anyone so they backtracked. If not for being a dragon ball homage it should've been a support really, hell, Wei is soulfist++ and he heals just by standing near people.

Also the only way Azena knows how to support is sending as many ancient spears as needed to kill the bully...
        I didn't know about that Soulfist rework.

But I think Wardancer/striker and Scrapper are too much punch already. And Soulfist is too many beams and energy balls but lacks the punchy side of Dragon Ball. They don't know how to design classes.

And they also failed at the Azena - Summoner conversion, because as you said Azena makes spears rain every second but it's one of the slowest skills for the Summoner in cast, animation and cooldown animation.
            For soulfist punchy you'd have to take out like half a tripods from Pummel and put them in a new skill because almost all martial moves are fist handwaves or hitting with our hip. Most energy attacks are also trash. It is a bit sad to see that there is 0 build variance between class engravings. Both use the same skills, tripods, spread of gems and are only distinct by small change in speed.
    Can someone please give this man a job at SG
        Ty. But don't get me started in Arthetine's classes. So much technology but apparently it all goes boom.

The Scouter could have another engraving( why only 2 branches?) where the drone can shield and reduce damage or create safe zones for the party. Or just another class that uses the drone and other devices to help the team.

People say that we don't have male mages or assassins because they need to create the body/models but they went and created the specialist classes, when we could have had more supports with the current models.

(and save this for later but the mages and assassins are going to recycle the striker/gunners' bodies)

Edit: I thought at first that the  Arcanist was a support class, with her cards being buffs for the party or nerfs for the enemy and different utilities for different situations all ruled by RNG.
We have 1 week until this problem is temporarily fixed. Then people will just make their artist a lopang slave later on.

 But short term there's going to be alot of supports here soon!
    In low-level content, sure, but how many of them will even make it to Brel?
        Even those that do make it will not have yearning and I assume not many pugs wants to deal with that.
        Brel G6 is Dps shortage
            This is not true.  I have both sups and DPS in my roster.  My sups are still instant-accepted in 5-6 runs while my DPS often end up sitting in lobbies waiting for sups...
                weds to friday is lf supp then it slowly changes to lf DPS starting around Sunday night onward from my experience
                probably because you are playing dps early in week where there is supp shortage.Later in week there are lot of support for last 2 gate.
                    Nope, I don't play *either* until 'later in the week' (at least by this subreddit's standards...).  I have an actual job and don't have time to run a bunch of raids on Wednesdays.  The majority of my raids happen on the weekend.
        Only the people already doing that content on supports lol. There may be a few outliers who switch to support main because of artist, but it won't be the majority.
Feel you man, it’s like what else if there to do when you quit? You gotta find something else to do for fun to take your mind off the game and soon you’ll just let go and not look back
>MMORPG forces you to play in parties.

That's why it's a MMO...
    I mean its not the first one i played and i think you got my point.
Plus, MMO refers only to the quantity of players and the type of servers it uses...
        Not really, I think almost every MMO, specially RPGs, requires some sort of player interaction or grouping. I think you are just playing the wrong game. If you don't want interaction, play an RPG.

They straight up reject the idea of reducing chaos and guardians raid to 1/day already. Merging the 2 would be the most interesting option, but there’s no chance they will do it. Smilegate just doubles down on keeping player doing repetitive homework.
    Yeah, and it's causing the game to die. The amount of zero effort braindead content this game makes you do purely to generate currency and keep up with market prices is crazy.

It's legit like clocking in on a factory assembly line job just to pay bills. Hard to keep people playing who actually have a real job already.

I sometimes convert item cost into legion raid gold rewards. Like "huh, this 87 quality ring costs 10 Vykas..." - it's messed up once you consider the time spent on farming the gold. Unless you deeply enjoy the content even after 50+ repeats it's just a bad time that's also paid very badly.
        Korean games never change their mind b4 playerbase goes to shit. 

 Just look at KR with how they treat new players and Card set gatekeeping? 1490 express when current content is 1600+ and a scuffed LoS clone instead of making LoS 18 baseline or reworking cards completly. Ontop of being too greedy to give new players 5x3 for 2-3 months. 4x3 no LoS 20 roster ppl surely gonna get into brels. No rewards to help new players in raids etc.
            Yeah. It's a shame bc this game has such an amazing foundational setup of controls, art style and gameplay mechanics.

It's just so bogged down by legacy system clutter, upgrade system inflation and stubborn anti-player grind.

And on top, the grind for currency lacks sufficient break points, so new players at entry ilvl have to compete for party spots against established endgame players and their armada of alts.
                The inflation part of upgrading is slowly killing my desire to continue even though i mostly enjoy the game. I'm only honing one brel character while generating mats from 4  characters regularly and its still not enough. Then we also have to generate mats for fuzion material while also spending gold to craft it. Why does it cost gold to craft something on top of the activity energy? The inflated cost of upgrading a character encourages RMT.
                Anti-player while simultaneously being pro-revenue generating 🤣
                    The top 10% probably spends more than the remaining 90%.
                    Do you truly think that’s a contradiction? If so, you learned nothing from Diablo Immortal and all the other games that prioritize their monetization over longevity and offered quality. Lost Ark makes more money by squeezing idiots dry who drop the game soon afterwards than by cultivating a long term low spending player base.

So yeah, it is often very much anti player to be pro maximized revenue. Hell, it almost always is.
            I was always curious whether KR had a gatekeeping problem also, I guess it's just a problem of the game.. but they should figure out a way to get people to wanna help new players with some kind of reward or what not.
        Yeah and for people that have jobs you quickly realize you can buy 50k gold for 15 bucks.. just demotivates you even more to do homework. If I really liked the raids I’d log in to do those then buy 50k gold a week to keep up with progression. Boom just solved the time issue with lost ark.
    Its a calculated biz decision, if they give you those QOL changes, certainly they know ppl will not fury/frustrated swipe. The whole game is working on player mental, they want to infuriate player to swipe anyway possible.
    They did say that the amount of “chores” is what they feel to be the minimum level of effort in the last LOA-on
        If they actually were forced to play their own game I bet they would change their mind.
    Honestly after returning to the game in Nov, I'm ready to stop again. Raids are fun the first few times, but get boring after you do them even 3 or 4 times a week for multiple weeks.
    I like doing all of my chaos dungeons and guardian raids. I wish I had more stuff to do because I’m done in the first hour I play 🤷 I only have 3 characters rn
        Then create more characters

&#x200B;

Why are you for more homework ?
            Why so I can get burnt out and complain like everyone in this thread? Lol I will be soon with express pass. I like doing all of the daily stuff there’s nothing wrong with me enjoying it. You don’t HAVE to do it. You also get rested bonus…
    Players double down on doing it. You don't have to
        This attitude about content makes players realize their time is being wasted, though. The reward in proportion to time spent is just too low.

And once people realize this, they are just one step away from quitting.
            the biggest lost ark lie told by streamers: "Lost ark respects your time"
>All you'd have to do in our current version is Brel for each character at i490+ and it just gives you x3 gold

Better yet remove 3 of the 6 gates.They realized its a bad idea and corrected it with akkan.

Gate 6 is a waiting game too which sucks balls when you're over geared.
> realize it's not healthy for players

lol. they KNOW it's not healthy for players and are very much aware of the minimum time investment to get a return on the game. as i and many people have said from the beginning, the game is designed from the ground up to extract as much time and investment from players as possible. thinking they dont realize or dont know is very naive.
Yeah I hate the idea that I still am compelled to run Valtan/Vykas. Like please I've done hundreds of times now i'm so bored of them BUT I CANT STOP BECAUSE THEY GIVE SO MUCH GOLD A WEEK.
i agree with u on most points , except doing old raids , if u dont give intensive to do older raids will be abondoned . and other players will not be able to enjoy it , hence gatekeeping
I don't think someone summarized it any better than this
It's all calculated to make the most profit out of player's misery, and people believing That they will change that to " accommodate" us are on copium, sadly, (but I understand them)
I recently started the Witcher 3. It's like a breath of fresh air.  Looking forward to Blue Protocol and Diablo 4.

Some things I'm looking for in my next long term game: (1) near simultaneous content release {within 1 week allowing for different patch days}. (2) amount of daily/weekly required activities. (3) how much time do I spend looking at a loading screen.
    Me too actually, Witcher 3 is one of my all time favorites and I finally recently upgraded to a PC that game run the HD update pretty well.  A friend of mine got me to try Albion online and I'm liking it so far but not sure how much of a time commitment it is later on.
        Albione online is great. Played it for a long time.

The good thing about albion is that there is no time commitment unless you do zvz. And zvz is kinda meh, i never liked it.

So unless you do zvz, hell - you can just do whatever u want and whenever u want.

No dailies, no weeklies, nothing you " have " to do.

The only issue with the game is that when ur veteran, you dont have much to do. Its when u like level up everything u need, when ur so rich that loot doesnt really mean anything like it used to - eh.

I had lot of fun with the game. The potential for epic moments in it is high, especially if you play solo and if you use the game mechanics against others. Used to make some vids here and there - here one funny moment of baiting people :D [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpSYykrEQzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpSYykrEQzQ)
            hooly shitoe haha that looks fun. I'm actually great with that kind of expiration date, end-game in mmos is overrated.
No it's the other way around. There is a lot of homework, but you can choose how much of it to do. The problem is there is pressure to do *all* your homework to keep up with gatekeeping standards so you can actually do fun content. If all kinds of players (hardcore, casual, anything in between) could fill their own parties without affecting each other I don't see a problem. But casual lobbies don't exist because all the supports go to juicer/hardcore lobbies. So I'm pretty sure support shortage is the root of the problem here.

Eliminating homework would just turn this game into a different kind of game, the kind that intentionally limits your grinding ability so no players can normally get far ahead (unless you swipe), and that's how they artificially keep the even ground. But that's a backwards way to go about solving the problem.
    I agree with you in that its gatekeeping that is the problem of pressure to do all the homework to keep up but disagree the root. The root of why gatekeeping exists is b/c they allow such a vast power differential between players who queue for the same activity. Match making in games that offer equalized / standardized characters doesn't face this same issue.

If Ilevel was used strictly to gain accesss to content and character systems were adjusted to give slight benefits. Gatekeeping would almost disappear because waiting for 5 minutes for someone who has slightly higher damage reduction/output no longer is worth the time cost. Along with a complete removal of a players ability to outgear content.
        Gatekeeping is the same as getting solar stuff and books in improving honing RNG, becuz it has no pity system, a group can fail infinitely etc. Higher ilevel/item =/= automatic clear but rather like a RNG boost in honing, it reduce the chance of failure.
 Homeworks are mat gating. Gatekeeping is essential to money making for the company, it pressures ppl to swipe in order to catchup.
I did brel 1-6 on my main last week and logged off for the week lol..
    Hahaha yeah I feel you, the game has started to feel more like a chore than anything else. 

I recently started playing Deep Rock Galactic and it's just been refreshing.
        I’ve been playing Sons of the Forest and valorant.
            Recently went back to eldenring ring. Lost ark is.
Never done 5-6 brel, and don't feel like doing them cause doing 1-4 on 2 characters drains me for the whole week.
    Never seen 6 because the prog groups I've been in have abandoned in 5 pretty quickly.

    Have you even tried the class? And played it properly?
        [deleted]
            Sounds like an user problem.
That's part of it. I actually like alts as most of the classes in this game are satisfying to play. My gripe is I'm starting to hate gearing them up because of abyssmal drops on accessories. Across 16 characters, i've probably got 3 very average drops that i'm currently using. Evertything else has had to be purchased off market/AH which also comes with the pheon tax.
"homework" IS the rest of the game.  
The game also pays you to do that "homework" so you can go back and help your fellow players with a good reason to do old content.
Relic accessories aren't outdated even in KR. Ancient accessories are a very minor upgrade over relic for their price.
    1 level of engravings (if you replace all 5 +3/+5 relics with +3/+6 ancient) and a little bit of STR/DEX/INT isn’t really a lot. Ancients don’t even give increased stats of crit/spec/swift. We will be good with relics for quite a long time
U can go over 1590 o.o?
    Meant 1490 haha.
        Hahhahah mine all over 1520 but i only play 5 char and if i got time i do weekly on 6th one, and yeah getting title help a lot and its the diff betweeen 1 hour bre and 5 hour bre. It also help i got 2 sup which dont need much invest yet so i can pump everytjing into my dps.
>now know I have to farm a shit ton of gold for spec accessories that will be outdated in a month.

Here is the neat thing: You actually DON'T know. Relic accessories are VERY much still relevant in KR. :)
The game does not even give you enough silver to hone if you just have one main.  And as you hone the alts you dig yourself into a deeper hole.  It's absolutely by the game's design.
    The fuck am i reading? Then you and many other do definitly something wrong. My main is 1560 with 1x 1460 1x 1445 and 1x 1415 im sitting on close to 120m silver and 1,17m raw gold + over 500 L Shard Bags. And I haven’t even spent money dunno what u guys do wrong especially those who swipe too.
        You have four characters? l2read and stop being so madge?
            Yes and I did my first alt when my main was around 1490 out of boredom even without them I would have more than enough silver. Then you should stop spreading missinformation and quit the game or learn how to spend your recourses or stop getting catched by FOMO. If you want everything in a week like many of the other whiny guys here then play a shooter or smth but not a MMO.
Yeah I was amazed when ATK was talking about how he recommended his friend to take a bus. Like bruv you play 200 chars and won´t even help a brother out? Can´t imagine any1 sticking around if they aren´t into it or have friends helping
    Yeah I was playing with a friend and I would not raid with my Paladin to raid only with him to make it easier for him to get accepted, because I've been in that spot sometimes that my friends would just go "Oh just get to X level by yourself" then why am I even bothering playing the game if I'm going to play by myself?

He still quit because he didn't enjoy how the legion raids work (weekly homework).
        That's basically where I'm at. The weekly homework doesn't feel great after beating it so many times. It was fun beating valtan close to ilvl, but now it's just boring, and you end up spending more time in PF because people still gate keep.
This is why I left my last guild
In my opinion learning parties are inpractical bc of lock outs. I have plenty of time, but hosting a learning party is a huge time commitment and I'd rather just join and help out for about an hour and not deal with being stuck on gate 2 if the group disbands. 

Let us repeat raids and do something about bussing game would be way better.
    Bussing is interesting. Its value is huge, you can double your gold intake by bussing. The problem is that it essentially ruins the new player experience completely.

I’m not against bussing but I also think that its gotten out of hand, as well, which has also contributed to gatekeeping.
        I ran Argos bus the other day, and one of the passengers was a 1370 mokoko bard with an okay build, and she played with us doing normal bard stuff and did the mechanics too. So sad that she had to pay 1500g for the privilege of just doing the raid normally as a new player. And "funny" thing is that she was lucky to not get gatekept from even joining the bus, some drivers I ran with refused to take mokokos because they don't know how to use AH (fair enough).
            Isn’t there also a trusted status restriction on the AH? So it is reasonable to think that a mokoko player wouldn’t have a trusted account. So they may know how to use AH but can’t? This is what I have heard, I don’t keep track of these things though.
        Well I'm in the opinion that buses are fine (I bus from time to time). I just want unlimited entries for raids cuz I want to do them when I'm bored. I don't want lock outs. 

But unlimited entries= unlimited buses so that's what they'll have to tackle. Or tbh if it's unlimited entry there might be too much competition for bussing and prices would be down?
            Heck, some players might just start joining old raids for fun or even carrying friends or guildies if they could run the same raid multiple times on the same character. People freak out about unlimited runs = unlimited busses, but it really weakens the power of a busser when other people can just fill that slot.
            >But unlimited entries= unlimited buses so that's what they'll have to tackle. Or tbh if it's unlimited entry there might be too much competition for bussing and prices would be down?

Unlimited busses capitulates on itself. Prices would become extremely low and filling a bus would take even longer than it does now because of how many other lobbies there would be.
            No lockout are coming in the next KR update right? So next year you’ll have no lockouts lol
                No there's still lock outs lol. They just removed the 3 legion raids limiter. You can still only enter valtan once per week with one character.
            Final fantasy ran into this issue and aside from their content being _usually_ harder to bus for large numbers, what it simply does is make the reward structure go like this:

- If you clear with all 8 players new to the raid or haven't consumed their weekly lockout, 2 chests of loot.

- if 1-4 player has already cleared this week, only 1 chest drops.

- If 5-8 players have already cleared, no chest drops.

You can just do your own 2 chest run as a seasoned player then simply join a friend in a learning or prog party, they'll get 1 chest or zero chest, but clearing the raid gives a guaranteed drop which counts towards their gear progression. The chests are more akin to the box we buy after raid clear from the side menu in lost ark.

Would people be against getting a vykas clear if it only meant they don't get to buy the chest and double their wings? I think a lot of people would be, and it's a shame that Lost Ark's answer isn't to strike a middle ground but rather just declare open warfare against the idea of player choice repetition.
    \+10000 learning party means that you risk that your character won't finish the raid at that week and you lose gold. you sacrifice your own resources to teach someone. they put a design to reduces buses and in return make the learning partis way more difficult. 

I wouldn't mind join learning party on character I already did the clear with and just joining for help but this is not the case
    Just give people ability to run more legion raids without lock out, but you get very little in loot and your character is lowered to lowest ilevel requirements so no bus
They can introduce extra rewards for having a mokoko in your raid, and that’ll be solved
    Don't worry I'll take that juicy compensation as I boost my good mokoko friends sjsjsggsv and kdkfllflf
        They’re already getting boosted, its irrelevant.
            but now other will be incentivised to boost too with that compensation. yum yum
                The bots are already paying really well, people who dont care are already incentivized.

You’re willfully ignoring that this allows many mokokos to actually get to play the game, be helped and feel like part of the community, your “worries” are already happening.
    Good idea and they give mokoko status to players who haven't played for a month or two months
    Depending on the raid, time to complete with someone you have to teach or carry, etc. The gold value is anywhere between 4,500 to 8,000. Unless there is a way to compensate based on time spent in a raid with a mokoko and reward based on how far above the average completion time it is, it isn’t feasible. 

I’m not advocating for gatekeeping. I just don’t think any rewards they would be willing to add, would deter a lot of people. Especially when you consider new raid tiers, new soft reset gear. That Vykas with a mokoko could cause so much time to lapse a persons alt might not get a Brel clear because that person only has 2-3 hours on that Sunday. This is essentially allowing a mokoko to grief someone elses roster progression because of time jailge.

Unfortunately, that is how the game is inherently designed.
Just a quick advice, never run content through matchmaking except maybe abyssal dungeons. You will get matched with people who juat wanna be carried, and they will usually ask to quit dungeon as soon as they say there is no juiced character in the party.
    My problem right now (just hit 1400ilvl) is that matchmaking groups usually can't clear, and pf groups are either busses or reject my applications, wanting higher ilvl.
        Stick to yoho, trust me.
            Not sure what you mean
            Deska is way easier and I get much better teammates too. When I was doing yoho we would constantly fail. Fuck that
                ...you can't do deskaluda at 1400. Velganos is cancer in a pug setting. So stick to Yoho until 1415.
    yah, I'm getting the picture. so cancerous
    i actually had a 1490 in my party that did less damage than my 1410. Ended up carrying them. They were fully maxed on Argos gear (no valtan or vykas relic) so I assume it was one of the early whale swipers.
nah. double or triple the gold earned from raids and reduce gold earning characters proportionally.

sg will never tho. they want us to grind and when we get sick of the grind it incentives spending real money to skip the grind. converting f2p into p2p is the endgame for sg and let be honest that shit works so well.

also reducing gold earning characters and boosting gold per raid will never fly because building characters also generates profits for them.  the game is designed to min max profits
There aren't many learning lobbies. It's not that deep, my guy.

Sure, there's some that want a free carry, but these are mostly not new players. New players tend to still be enamored of the game, have less homework, and want to actually experience the raid.

Even on ilvl parties gatekeep.
the grind will always exist so their is an incentive to pay to skip it.
I mean, even if AGS hate  buses is on SG to do anything about it. They can sugest it but then all regions will need to remove busing and that's something that will upset a lot of people as well.
    But based on the tweet AGS doesn't hate busses. For anything to happen AGS needs to think it's a problem enough to bring it up with SG.  SG isn't watching the 'global' region. Based on the tweet it seems they're fine with the status quo.

Edit: they do all kinds of things that upset a bunch of people. Look at pheongate. There were people complaining about the golden frog issue handling.
        Busing is the way to retain new player to give them hope and progression to look forward to, of cuz smilegate likes it and encourages it, more players retained more possiblity of swipe, why not. A raid structure like lost ark, if without busing will die out pretty fast.
            Or you create an incentive that encourages seasoned players to help new players. FF14 has a random queue that gives extra rewards, so you queue into low level dungeons but get the same rewards. A mentorship program could be added to the game. FF14 has that as well, and mentors get rewards. I've heard not all people who sign up are good mentors, but the company is trying.
                Idk what smilegate will do, certainly thats possible if player count start to thin out. All raid mmo goes throughthe same thing/path, the other easy way is to move group wipe to hard/hell level, like different tier with different loot.
    Yeah, people shit on AGS too much sometimes. Sure, they're to blame for quite a few things, but SG also deserves a lot more criticism for the shit they're responsible for.
        I think it's fine to criticize AGS in this case. AGS could have tweeted "we're actively working on the bussing issue with SG." Instead they tweeted a cartoon that said "tip your driver".
            Well, we don't know the nature of their contract with SG, and will likely never will.

Maybe they're in a position where they can't even mention it. I wouldn't be surprised, tbh.
Reading all this makes it painfully clear you only play p2w mmos with mechanics in place to punish free players. The worse part is how willing you are to guzzle it all down, as are many others I'm sure.
    [deleted]
        I never said that you were wrong. I said that it's clear you only play p2w mmos that are designed to punish f2p players and are willing to guzzle it down. But that's just the state of anything f2p. That's why I stick to ff 14. I pay 15 a month and play a solid mmo that respects my time, doesn't punish new players, and puts everyone on the same playing field with no monetary advantages besides buying level ups.
The reason I came here is because I wanted to see the state of things because Lost Ark DOES have pretty damn good combat, visuals, and presentation and I wanted to see if it was worth it to come back. Your absurd comment, among other things, just made me feel gross and not want to even log in again. So back to ff 14 I go.
Unfortunately, the 1460s in the current game aren't as skilled or geared as the 1460s when vykas was just released. Even on my paladin I ended up getting jailed trying to help 1460s 'cause they didn't do enough damage. Two people did 50% of the dps in gate 1, but gate 2 was the real jail when ppl just kept dying to stupid things. In the end, they got dps checked hard.
Yeah but realistically speaking thats just the incentive you have for doing all of that stuff , like every single one of those you already get as your character level up and gating those behind doing horizontal is well as i said just incentive so you do that stuff ,so its nothing unique ,and rapport and collectibles just give stats and barely nothing else besides map percentage ,and the other collectibles are more of the same , they are just systems for the lulz and barely make a difference besides skillpoints and runes you can alocate them anywhere else they dont need to be where they at and the game would still be the same ,so thats what i mean , when you really look into it beside the raids and playable characters everything else is just a shell to say you have something to do
    It’s still really important and some classes are pretty poor or below their ceiling without out it, if the skill screen load out was shown then I’d deny a lot of gunslingers for not having close to max skill point or lunar reapers for not having all their wealth runes. It’s not essentially but you really gimp your damage on some classes without some of the horizontal prog to the point where you do way less damage on some classes
        Yes but my point is , those skillpoints can just be givem to you as you level up , the so called "skill point" potion doesnt need to exist just like all of the other stats they give u as potions , they already give you stats , the other couple can be just included there ,its just a fancy way of getting them and thats it, runes as well they can just give them to you by doing guardians and chaos and that it ,the horizontal its just a fancy system to get them ,or the runes could just no exist and the abilities give more of what the runes already give and thats it ,or you can reduce stagger on bossed so you dont need overwhelm and classes can tranform faster so you dont need wealth , its just a fancy system of stuff you already have to keep you occupued but its not necessary because you already have it
            So do you want non-raid content to matter or not? They have to have some reward for horizontal or else as you said it doesn’t matter. I don’t understand what you want if you don’t want the game to just be raids but also don’t want non-raid content progression to have power rewards? Some classes need those rewards or they have shit damage in raids so it’s not like those rewards don’t matter. Sure it’s a ‘fancy’ way of getting them but this is literally how video games work, you play them to progress, it’s like you guys have never played a video game before lol
                Bruh how are you so dense lol , my point is ,the only reason horizontal matters its because of the rewards , but seeing it from outside the only reason horizontal gets done are the skillpoints and some runes , as a whole horizontal doesnt matter and the game would still be the same without it , im not arguing if the stuff matters or not ,of course skillpoints matter  my point is either you do it good or you dont and horizontal content is done like shit and behind it they are gating vital resources that they can just give in any other way and bot lose vita development time on horizontal content they dont know how to do ,of course i would like horizontal content to matter z but i want it to matter in a gameplay way , not matter just because it gives u skillpoints and other stuff that its only there to progress on other horizontal stuff that is at best half baked
                    If you are trying to say horizontal is shit and only required because of the skill points and runes then sure. Considering that there isn’t much required horizontal content and most people don’t play the horizontal content past what is required I doubt they will change it up much and just continue with adding small islands and events in the manner they have been doing
                        I know they will not change it because they dont need to , my point is the horizontal content is pointless and the game doesnt need it , it would still be the same game or better and the only reason it its there its because losr ark wants to mimick games like diablo and poe eithout understanding it is neither
                They should just make side content give cosmetics IMO.  You need to do quite a bit of (IMO boring) side content to max out on skill pots.  Uninteresting side content is not why I play MMOs.  I'm a min maxer though, so I dredged through them.
The best part is not having to do the whole learning prog. Getting to ilvl for raids 1 month after it comes out means that there are more players who know the mechanics. I've experienced learning runs and the same person was dying on the same mechanic for 2 hours+. Some people are just extremely bad at learning mechanics.
Thanks brother, 
I truely hope so aswell. 

I only reached around Ilvl 1405, and by the time I got there nobody took raiding seriouse and I could only "progress" through buss...  

I'm holding my fingers
    When I started playing the game back at launch I only had one character that I slowly pushed, I was among the last people to reach T3 of the people that started at launch because I took my time searching mokkokos and doing all the collectibles (also I changed servers and character before I reached lvl 50 too, so I missed all the Argos fiasco that people cried about)
I played only one character up until brel release almost, my character was always ready for content on release., now I started playing multiple characters but honestly it's possible to play slowly and be ready for content, it's just your gold income that will be a bit lower but other than that it's possible to play less then 6 characters.
If gold is really an issue and the feel of slower progress compared to others good solution is to just park alts at 1415-1445 range and just do raids with them and nothing else.
I don't have a +20 weapon right now so I'm "technically behind" based on some no lifers but I know I'll get there soon enough when it becomes relevant or needed, right now having a +20 brell stuff is only for flex and not needed at all for any current content.
While I see where you’re coming from it doesn’t apply to Lost Ark. Raids are literally sequenced with very small windows of variability. MOBAs require the same map because of the seemingly infinite combinations and interactions between heroes and game outcomes (and quite literally everything in between). So alts don’t achieve the same effect, it’s just different colours, positioning and tempo to do the identical dance 6x.
    I agree with this. LoL also has different runes/items that slightly diversify your champs playstyle and is still viable. There's really only a 2-way deviation in builds for lost ark chars and more often than not, there is a theoretical best build that significantly out-paces the other.
Maybe at starts true but after a while you get used to character gameplay and they are feels the same .I can do chaos -guardians while watching movie :D Even better when playing paladin I can do all raids watching second monitor.
Nah PvP games can't be compared. Every game feels different because your opponents are playing differently and they're picking different champions. Also the game is competitive so that spices up every match. Lost Ark becomes repetitive even if you have 6 different classes and the fact that you have to play 6 different classes just to 'fend off' the monotony of doing the same thing is indicative of the game's terrible gameplay loop.
Yeah I think it would
There is a very simple approach, don't let people overgear content so much (ilvl cap on content) and then you can create less raid wipe mechs along with stricter dps checks and busing with a low amount of drivers instantly becomes unviable and only actual great players would be able to pull it off. ATM any average Joe can bus since they are so far ahead they barely take damage and just delete bars.

That is my biggest grip with LA (besides the obvious of too much dailies/weeklies). It is also what makes more than half of the classes "bad" because only burst builds really perform well in such short encounters, it trivializes content so quickly it is ridiculous. Some people already are miles ahead in item level BEFORE a new raid drops.
with that logic everything that gets added to the game is somehow increasing gatekeeping even when it's just 100 weapon dmg from some special mokokoseed found somewhere in the early area and can never be found again after you passed it. Like bro stop that shit. How do they even find out that you have characters better geared than the character you're applying with? We dont have a user database yet.

If you can ''Share'' every single drop from raids(Accessories, tokens ect + without a pheons cost) with your roster, you can easily gear your alts up with your main and if you feel like playing your alt, just go with it.

Have you ever throught about to create your own party/raid? Because if you really wanna play your low geared alt in the current high end content, then it's you trying to get carried and not everyone else gatekeeping you.
    Wait is there actually a special Mokoko seed early game that you are supposed to find? 😂
the market cap and buying cooldown
14 has tons to do besides endgame raiding. that has also nothing to do with gaining power. rouge like dungeons, leveling the 19 different classes on a single character, collecting glamour (skins), housing, crafting and gathering with actual systems behind them and tons of other stuff that isnt homework or some weekly lockout
In other mmos you could go to several older maps to farm something for example. But in this gane since the loot progression AND gold is gated in raids, theres nothing else to do but to raid. You cant go and farm a certain boss or a certain dungeon because everything is worth nothing in comparison to raid loot and gold.

The world is vast and beautifull but since drops are non existent (this game is not a conventional action arpg of loot collecting), you end up standing in town waiting for a queue. 

Unas, island souls etc doesnt count because those are collectibles, you dont earn thibgs that you can sell in the store to progress exploring the game. All is funneled in raids. 

This limits the experience greatly and missuses the vast amount of content this game has in terms of exploration and diversity. It just pleases hsrdcore raid players, which is not innerhently bad, but it turns out bad when is your only gameplan to keep people in.
    I disagree focusing in end game raiding is bad for Lost Ark, if anything is one of the strongest points and the biggest appeal of the game. The issue is how hard and grindy can get to progress specially after Brel Raid, the cost of honing is insane and the only way to do it is doing homework with 6 characters every day.   


That's the biggest flaw in my opinion, and what make focusing in more horizontal content pointless since the grind make player ignore it. If you could gain gear progression or have a true reset in gearing this wouldn't be an issue but SG refused out of fear to do so, so they keep delaying the matter and making things worst. There is a reason even in KR people is tired of doing chaos and guardian for 4 years non stop, having no alternatives to progress towards the raid is soulcrushing.
        Players ignore horizontal content not because of the grind, but Because the return of time invested on it is puny in comparison to the raid benefits.

Why would you invest time in content outside the raids of it is not only time consuming but also borderline useless in comparison?

On top of that, add the raid problem that you just mentioned. At this point the powercreep in gear is unberable already in global, and in korea is beyond it.
My best example would be WoW (a subsciption based) where you can go back to older raids from previous Expansions to farm for free skins/transmog, pets, and mounts for the Cosmetic End-game.
    So repetitive content locked behind a weekly limited rng wall for 0 gain?
        If you don't want free stuff from easy soloable voluntary content, then don't do it? I prefer that over the constant raiding hamster wheel for Gold that is Lost Ark.
            You tried giving an example for non-repetitive content and I pointed out that it is and worse then you what you were making it out to be.
                It is non-repetitive because it is voluntary, i.e. you don't have to redo old content for cosmetic stuff if you don't want to. It is a repetitive chore if you make it become a chore. In Lost Ark, you need gold for nearly everything and the only way to get gold is through Time (Legion raids) or Money (Swipe).
                    It is repetitive if you want to get the thing you are hunting for which is the reason you are doing it. Just because its voluntary doesn't mean it is not repetitive and still has weekly lock outs and RNG behind it which means you could possibily never get those items.
                        Grinding cosmetics is repetitive anyways. Can sugar coat it, but it'll still be repetitive grinding. Tried a game where one outfit was locked at an abysmal 1% drop rate. Ran the dungeon 330 times for it. 

Swapping to support main instead is less stress. Easy to get into lobbies regardless. Have 3 supports and 3 alt dps. Can always use the supports to funnel the mats into 1 dps if I want to anyways.
Best example I can think of is gear appearance: LA - Cash shop/Market purchase of Cash shop items OR spam chaos dungeons and pray you get lucky for 1 skin per class.

WoW -  you have almost 20 years worth of gear appearances obtainable from pretty much everything that you can use to make your character look unique and completely badass. 

I love T2 DB armor I'd love to be able to tmog it as my gear skin.
So, just like WoW and FFXIV.
    Yeah I feel like that is a problem for most of the popular MMOs, you are in the same place most of the time and do the world exploration a few times and never look back. So a lot of beautifull maps and zones are there rotting since they are obsolete.
    Maybe its a problem with the genre, I haven't played those. Im just saying how I feel about lost ark 🙂
As and endgame option is a greatvidea to have difficult raids... For the people that like raiding,

But gating everything behind raids is stupid korean lazy design.

What a waste of potential on a game.
    Nail on the head mate, raids are fine but shouldn't be the single point of progression,
Most mmo has content for both group and solo, the true is solo biased player base is much bigger then group in general. When the game decays, you will have dufficulty to find 8 person to do raid, and the players leaving isnt those got gatekeeping but those experieced one got burnout, this is how raid die, lost ark isnt the first but wont be the last neither.
    Buddy, it is a mmo. It is made for people looking to interact with other people. You can’t solo current raids or dungeons in WoW and FFXIV and are ilvl capped in those games too. This genre caters towards people who want to play with others, this isn’t made for solo players who have every other genre and game heavily catered towards them. MMO’s that cater to a more solo style is what kills the game cause that makes less interaction between people and no connection to the game and they just leave. Go play Genshin, PoE, or Albion or countless other titles made for you.
        Raid itself cant be substained once players count dips below critical mass, to survive it has to have  some solo content in place, or constantly reinvent the game, like battlefield or CoD.
            If a MMO doesn't have players then it is a dead game and even solo players are going to leave cause then there is no economy or no reason to play. Catering towards solo players in a MMO is the quickest way to kill MMO's cause solo players don't have any commitment and move on to new trends fast and have no connections to the community. Idk how u fail to understand the niche MMO's provide....they are not made for the solo player and never were lol
Right
lol then he swiped his ass off because I started 2 months ago and I have been playing everyday for 10+ hours and I just got to 1500 today. Swiped ALOT and I had help too. Let’s not even talk about the fact that his roster level is probably 100 and he will be gatekept unless he’s in a group
that is absolutely not true.

I only spent money on the two express event passes, I have about 3.5m worth of stuff to sell, I am currently 1576 ilvl and almost full level 9 gems.

I only play one main in a realistic manner. I also got a bard that's 1460 that I may or may not do raids with. I also got a second sorc that I will very rarely do any raid with, usually only argos and I got a reaper that I only buy buss from once in a while. Their only real purpose is lopang when I need silver and peyto/fernanda card packs. I do not run guardians or chaos with them except in the very rare occurence (I may have ran 2 turtles in the past month).

Alts are NOT even close to required.
    Agreed. Only have one main 1560 and I have a 1460 bard that I never play. You don’t need alts.
    Ok, then maybe there is even more leeway than I thought, the players I know (who have been able to catch up and keep up playing 1 character) started playing a month after launch and spent 0 money, but my point was also that alts are NOT required to progress main, they are just required if one wants to play more, have more bifrosts / card-buying characters, and such stuff.
        Ahh yes the "I play 6 characters and I don't have any time" crowd. It's so ironic that they chose to make and play that many characters when it's not necessary.
            I choose to play multiple characters because I can and want to, I am aware I am this way actually less efficient and progress more slowly (and would only maybe be more efficient if I played an unreasonable number of hours per day or if I played in the most unfun ways) - my brother and I started at the same time, he plays half the hours per week than I, and has progressed much more quickly than I, in ilvl and even in horizontal content (in everything except roster lvl), in big part because he plays only one character. Once I finally decide on 1-2 classes I want to play the most or/and once I'll have less time, I'll likely play only 1-2 characters, if I don't quit raiding / quit entirely (by) then.
Yikes, can you please explain what happened to me and my group here then.  
Also, none of us 8 got any re-entry ticket. Yikes.

    O no, you missed out on 5 Brel horns in the 15th week you’re definitely gonna quit the game now I’m sure. What makes people quit the game are the endless chores and burnouts. This is one unfortunate thing that happened to you that impacts maybe 15 min of your time, chores are 2-3 hours a day
        O no my bad, I guess I didn't read the title of OP's post and that disconnects that are surprisingly happening until now is **NOT** a big issue.

Imagine reading. Yikes.
Kek, op asked for biggest issues and disconnects are hands down one of the biggest issues since it has and will continue to actually ruins players' immersion/experience/raids.

Meanwhile you on the other hand think 2 guardians and 2 chaos a day is a big issue when players can opt to skip them or use rest bonus. Imagine not using rest bonus in 2023. Players are given an option when it comes to homework, but they can't do anything when it comes to the servers/disconnects XDDDD
They kinda wanted to rework soulfist into dps/support hybrid like gunlancer year ago but it was 30% dps nerf for some marginal support benefits and really not popular with really anyone so they backtracked. If not for being a dragon ball homage it should've been a support really, hell, Wei is soulfist++ and he heals just by standing near people.

Also the only way Azena knows how to support is sending as many ancient spears as needed to kill the bully...
    I didn't know about that Soulfist rework.

But I think Wardancer/striker and Scrapper are too much punch already. And Soulfist is too many beams and energy balls but lacks the punchy side of Dragon Ball. They don't know how to design classes.

And they also failed at the Azena - Summoner conversion, because as you said Azena makes spears rain every second but it's one of the slowest skills for the Summoner in cast, animation and cooldown animation.
        For soulfist punchy you'd have to take out like half a tripods from Pummel and put them in a new skill because almost all martial moves are fist handwaves or hitting with our hip. Most energy attacks are also trash. It is a bit sad to see that there is 0 build variance between class engravings. Both use the same skills, tripods, spread of gems and are only distinct by small change in speed.
Can someone please give this man a job at SG
    Ty. But don't get me started in Arthetine's classes. So much technology but apparently it all goes boom.

The Scouter could have another engraving( why only 2 branches?) where the drone can shield and reduce damage or create safe zones for the party. Or just another class that uses the drone and other devices to help the team.

People say that we don't have male mages or assassins because they need to create the body/models but they went and created the specialist classes, when we could have had more supports with the current models.

(and save this for later but the mages and assassins are going to recycle the striker/gunners' bodies)

Edit: I thought at first that the  Arcanist was a support class, with her cards being buffs for the party or nerfs for the enemy and different utilities for different situations all ruled by RNG.
In low-level content, sure, but how many of them will even make it to Brel?
    Even those that do make it will not have yearning and I assume not many pugs wants to deal with that.
    Brel G6 is Dps shortage
        This is not true.  I have both sups and DPS in my roster.  My sups are still instant-accepted in 5-6 runs while my DPS often end up sitting in lobbies waiting for sups...
            weds to friday is lf supp then it slowly changes to lf DPS starting around Sunday night onward from my experience
            probably because you are playing dps early in week where there is supp shortage.Later in week there are lot of support for last 2 gate.
                Nope, I don't play *either* until 'later in the week' (at least by this subreddit's standards...).  I have an actual job and don't have time to run a bunch of raids on Wednesdays.  The majority of my raids happen on the weekend.
    Only the people already doing that content on supports lol. There may be a few outliers who switch to support main because of artist, but it won't be the majority.
I mean its not the first one i played and i think you got my point.
Plus, MMO refers only to the quantity of players and the type of servers it uses...
    Not really, I think almost every MMO, specially RPGs, requires some sort of player interaction or grouping. I think you are just playing the wrong game. If you don't want interaction, play an RPG.
Yeah, and it's causing the game to die. The amount of zero effort braindead content this game makes you do purely to generate currency and keep up with market prices is crazy.

It's legit like clocking in on a factory assembly line job just to pay bills. Hard to keep people playing who actually have a real job already.

I sometimes convert item cost into legion raid gold rewards. Like "huh, this 87 quality ring costs 10 Vykas..." - it's messed up once you consider the time spent on farming the gold. Unless you deeply enjoy the content even after 50+ repeats it's just a bad time that's also paid very badly.
    Korean games never change their mind b4 playerbase goes to shit. 

 Just look at KR with how they treat new players and Card set gatekeeping? 1490 express when current content is 1600+ and a scuffed LoS clone instead of making LoS 18 baseline or reworking cards completly. Ontop of being too greedy to give new players 5x3 for 2-3 months. 4x3 no LoS 20 roster ppl surely gonna get into brels. No rewards to help new players in raids etc.
        Yeah. It's a shame bc this game has such an amazing foundational setup of controls, art style and gameplay mechanics.

It's just so bogged down by legacy system clutter, upgrade system inflation and stubborn anti-player grind.

And on top, the grind for currency lacks sufficient break points, so new players at entry ilvl have to compete for party spots against established endgame players and their armada of alts.
            The inflation part of upgrading is slowly killing my desire to continue even though i mostly enjoy the game. I'm only honing one brel character while generating mats from 4  characters regularly and its still not enough. Then we also have to generate mats for fuzion material while also spending gold to craft it. Why does it cost gold to craft something on top of the activity energy? The inflated cost of upgrading a character encourages RMT.
            Anti-player while simultaneously being pro-revenue generating 🤣
                The top 10% probably spends more than the remaining 90%.
                Do you truly think that’s a contradiction? If so, you learned nothing from Diablo Immortal and all the other games that prioritize their monetization over longevity and offered quality. Lost Ark makes more money by squeezing idiots dry who drop the game soon afterwards than by cultivating a long term low spending player base.

So yeah, it is often very much anti player to be pro maximized revenue. Hell, it almost always is.
        I was always curious whether KR had a gatekeeping problem also, I guess it's just a problem of the game.. but they should figure out a way to get people to wanna help new players with some kind of reward or what not.
    Yeah and for people that have jobs you quickly realize you can buy 50k gold for 15 bucks.. just demotivates you even more to do homework. If I really liked the raids I’d log in to do those then buy 50k gold a week to keep up with progression. Boom just solved the time issue with lost ark.
Its a calculated biz decision, if they give you those QOL changes, certainly they know ppl will not fury/frustrated swipe. The whole game is working on player mental, they want to infuriate player to swipe anyway possible.
They did say that the amount of “chores” is what they feel to be the minimum level of effort in the last LOA-on
    If they actually were forced to play their own game I bet they would change their mind.
Honestly after returning to the game in Nov, I'm ready to stop again. Raids are fun the first few times, but get boring after you do them even 3 or 4 times a week for multiple weeks.
I like doing all of my chaos dungeons and guardian raids. I wish I had more stuff to do because I’m done in the first hour I play 🤷 I only have 3 characters rn
    Then create more characters

&#x200B;

Why are you for more homework ?
        Why so I can get burnt out and complain like everyone in this thread? Lol I will be soon with express pass. I like doing all of the daily stuff there’s nothing wrong with me enjoying it. You don’t HAVE to do it. You also get rested bonus…
Players double down on doing it. You don't have to
    This attitude about content makes players realize their time is being wasted, though. The reward in proportion to time spent is just too low.

And once people realize this, they are just one step away from quitting.
        the biggest lost ark lie told by streamers: "Lost ark respects your time"
Me too actually, Witcher 3 is one of my all time favorites and I finally recently upgraded to a PC that game run the HD update pretty well.  A friend of mine got me to try Albion online and I'm liking it so far but not sure how much of a time commitment it is later on.
    Albione online is great. Played it for a long time.

The good thing about albion is that there is no time commitment unless you do zvz. And zvz is kinda meh, i never liked it.

So unless you do zvz, hell - you can just do whatever u want and whenever u want.

No dailies, no weeklies, nothing you " have " to do.

The only issue with the game is that when ur veteran, you dont have much to do. Its when u like level up everything u need, when ur so rich that loot doesnt really mean anything like it used to - eh.

I had lot of fun with the game. The potential for epic moments in it is high, especially if you play solo and if you use the game mechanics against others. Used to make some vids here and there - here one funny moment of baiting people :D [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpSYykrEQzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpSYykrEQzQ)
        hooly shitoe haha that looks fun. I'm actually great with that kind of expiration date, end-game in mmos is overrated.
I agree with you in that its gatekeeping that is the problem of pressure to do all the homework to keep up but disagree the root. The root of why gatekeeping exists is b/c they allow such a vast power differential between players who queue for the same activity. Match making in games that offer equalized / standardized characters doesn't face this same issue.

If Ilevel was used strictly to gain accesss to content and character systems were adjusted to give slight benefits. Gatekeeping would almost disappear because waiting for 5 minutes for someone who has slightly higher damage reduction/output no longer is worth the time cost. Along with a complete removal of a players ability to outgear content.
    Gatekeeping is the same as getting solar stuff and books in improving honing RNG, becuz it has no pity system, a group can fail infinitely etc. Higher ilevel/item =/= automatic clear but rather like a RNG boost in honing, it reduce the chance of failure.
Hahaha yeah I feel you, the game has started to feel more like a chore than anything else. 

I recently started playing Deep Rock Galactic and it's just been refreshing.
    I’ve been playing Sons of the Forest and valorant.
        Recently went back to eldenring ring. Lost ark is.
Never seen 6 because the prog groups I've been in have abandoned in 5 pretty quickly.

Have you even tried the class? And played it properly?
    [deleted]
        Sounds like an user problem.
1 level of engravings (if you replace all 5 +3/+5 relics with +3/+6 ancient) and a little bit of STR/DEX/INT isn’t really a lot. Ancients don’t even give increased stats of crit/spec/swift. We will be good with relics for quite a long time
Meant 1490 haha.
    Hahhahah mine all over 1520 but i only play 5 char and if i got time i do weekly on 6th one, and yeah getting title help a lot and its the diff betweeen 1 hour bre and 5 hour bre. It also help i got 2 sup which dont need much invest yet so i can pump everytjing into my dps.
The fuck am i reading? Then you and many other do definitly something wrong. My main is 1560 with 1x 1460 1x 1445 and 1x 1415 im sitting on close to 120m silver and 1,17m raw gold + over 500 L Shard Bags. And I haven’t even spent money dunno what u guys do wrong especially those who swipe too.
    You have four characters? l2read and stop being so madge?
        Yes and I did my first alt when my main was around 1490 out of boredom even without them I would have more than enough silver. Then you should stop spreading missinformation and quit the game or learn how to spend your recourses or stop getting catched by FOMO. If you want everything in a week like many of the other whiny guys here then play a shooter or smth but not a MMO.
Yeah I was playing with a friend and I would not raid with my Paladin to raid only with him to make it easier for him to get accepted, because I've been in that spot sometimes that my friends would just go "Oh just get to X level by yourself" then why am I even bothering playing the game if I'm going to play by myself?

He still quit because he didn't enjoy how the legion raids work (weekly homework).
    That's basically where I'm at. The weekly homework doesn't feel great after beating it so many times. It was fun beating valtan close to ilvl, but now it's just boring, and you end up spending more time in PF because people still gate keep.
Bussing is interesting. Its value is huge, you can double your gold intake by bussing. The problem is that it essentially ruins the new player experience completely.

I’m not against bussing but I also think that its gotten out of hand, as well, which has also contributed to gatekeeping.
    I ran Argos bus the other day, and one of the passengers was a 1370 mokoko bard with an okay build, and she played with us doing normal bard stuff and did the mechanics too. So sad that she had to pay 1500g for the privilege of just doing the raid normally as a new player. And "funny" thing is that she was lucky to not get gatekept from even joining the bus, some drivers I ran with refused to take mokokos because they don't know how to use AH (fair enough).
        Isn’t there also a trusted status restriction on the AH? So it is reasonable to think that a mokoko player wouldn’t have a trusted account. So they may know how to use AH but can’t? This is what I have heard, I don’t keep track of these things though.
    Well I'm in the opinion that buses are fine (I bus from time to time). I just want unlimited entries for raids cuz I want to do them when I'm bored. I don't want lock outs. 

But unlimited entries= unlimited buses so that's what they'll have to tackle. Or tbh if it's unlimited entry there might be too much competition for bussing and prices would be down?
        Heck, some players might just start joining old raids for fun or even carrying friends or guildies if they could run the same raid multiple times on the same character. People freak out about unlimited runs = unlimited busses, but it really weakens the power of a busser when other people can just fill that slot.
        >But unlimited entries= unlimited buses so that's what they'll have to tackle. Or tbh if it's unlimited entry there might be too much competition for bussing and prices would be down?

Unlimited busses capitulates on itself. Prices would become extremely low and filling a bus would take even longer than it does now because of how many other lobbies there would be.
        No lockout are coming in the next KR update right? So next year you’ll have no lockouts lol
            No there's still lock outs lol. They just removed the 3 legion raids limiter. You can still only enter valtan once per week with one character.
        Final fantasy ran into this issue and aside from their content being _usually_ harder to bus for large numbers, what it simply does is make the reward structure go like this:

- If you clear with all 8 players new to the raid or haven't consumed their weekly lockout, 2 chests of loot.

- if 1-4 player has already cleared this week, only 1 chest drops.

- If 5-8 players have already cleared, no chest drops.

You can just do your own 2 chest run as a seasoned player then simply join a friend in a learning or prog party, they'll get 1 chest or zero chest, but clearing the raid gives a guaranteed drop which counts towards their gear progression. The chests are more akin to the box we buy after raid clear from the side menu in lost ark.

Would people be against getting a vykas clear if it only meant they don't get to buy the chest and double their wings? I think a lot of people would be, and it's a shame that Lost Ark's answer isn't to strike a middle ground but rather just declare open warfare against the idea of player choice repetition.
\+10000 learning party means that you risk that your character won't finish the raid at that week and you lose gold. you sacrifice your own resources to teach someone. they put a design to reduces buses and in return make the learning partis way more difficult. 

I wouldn't mind join learning party on character I already did the clear with and just joining for help but this is not the case
Just give people ability to run more legion raids without lock out, but you get very little in loot and your character is lowered to lowest ilevel requirements so no bus
Don't worry I'll take that juicy compensation as I boost my good mokoko friends sjsjsggsv and kdkfllflf
    They’re already getting boosted, its irrelevant.
        but now other will be incentivised to boost too with that compensation. yum yum
            The bots are already paying really well, people who dont care are already incentivized.

You’re willfully ignoring that this allows many mokokos to actually get to play the game, be helped and feel like part of the community, your “worries” are already happening.
Good idea and they give mokoko status to players who haven't played for a month or two months
Depending on the raid, time to complete with someone you have to teach or carry, etc. The gold value is anywhere between 4,500 to 8,000. Unless there is a way to compensate based on time spent in a raid with a mokoko and reward based on how far above the average completion time it is, it isn’t feasible. 

I’m not advocating for gatekeeping. I just don’t think any rewards they would be willing to add, would deter a lot of people. Especially when you consider new raid tiers, new soft reset gear. That Vykas with a mokoko could cause so much time to lapse a persons alt might not get a Brel clear because that person only has 2-3 hours on that Sunday. This is essentially allowing a mokoko to grief someone elses roster progression because of time jailge.

Unfortunately, that is how the game is inherently designed.
My problem right now (just hit 1400ilvl) is that matchmaking groups usually can't clear, and pf groups are either busses or reject my applications, wanting higher ilvl.
    Stick to yoho, trust me.
        Not sure what you mean
        Deska is way easier and I get much better teammates too. When I was doing yoho we would constantly fail. Fuck that
            ...you can't do deskaluda at 1400. Velganos is cancer in a pug setting. So stick to Yoho until 1415.
yah, I'm getting the picture. so cancerous
i actually had a 1490 in my party that did less damage than my 1410. Ended up carrying them. They were fully maxed on Argos gear (no valtan or vykas relic) so I assume it was one of the early whale swipers.
But based on the tweet AGS doesn't hate busses. For anything to happen AGS needs to think it's a problem enough to bring it up with SG.  SG isn't watching the 'global' region. Based on the tweet it seems they're fine with the status quo.

Edit: they do all kinds of things that upset a bunch of people. Look at pheongate. There were people complaining about the golden frog issue handling.
    Busing is the way to retain new player to give them hope and progression to look forward to, of cuz smilegate likes it and encourages it, more players retained more possiblity of swipe, why not. A raid structure like lost ark, if without busing will die out pretty fast.
        Or you create an incentive that encourages seasoned players to help new players. FF14 has a random queue that gives extra rewards, so you queue into low level dungeons but get the same rewards. A mentorship program could be added to the game. FF14 has that as well, and mentors get rewards. I've heard not all people who sign up are good mentors, but the company is trying.
            Idk what smilegate will do, certainly thats possible if player count start to thin out. All raid mmo goes throughthe same thing/path, the other easy way is to move group wipe to hard/hell level, like different tier with different loot.
Yeah, people shit on AGS too much sometimes. Sure, they're to blame for quite a few things, but SG also deserves a lot more criticism for the shit they're responsible for.
    I think it's fine to criticize AGS in this case. AGS could have tweeted "we're actively working on the bussing issue with SG." Instead they tweeted a cartoon that said "tip your driver".
        Well, we don't know the nature of their contract with SG, and will likely never will.

Maybe they're in a position where they can't even mention it. I wouldn't be surprised, tbh.
[deleted]
    I never said that you were wrong. I said that it's clear you only play p2w mmos that are designed to punish f2p players and are willing to guzzle it down. But that's just the state of anything f2p. That's why I stick to ff 14. I pay 15 a month and play a solid mmo that respects my time, doesn't punish new players, and puts everyone on the same playing field with no monetary advantages besides buying level ups.
The reason I came here is because I wanted to see the state of things because Lost Ark DOES have pretty damn good combat, visuals, and presentation and I wanted to see if it was worth it to come back. Your absurd comment, among other things, just made me feel gross and not want to even log in again. So back to ff 14 I go.
It’s still really important and some classes are pretty poor or below their ceiling without out it, if the skill screen load out was shown then I’d deny a lot of gunslingers for not having close to max skill point or lunar reapers for not having all their wealth runes. It’s not essentially but you really gimp your damage on some classes without some of the horizontal prog to the point where you do way less damage on some classes
    Yes but my point is , those skillpoints can just be givem to you as you level up , the so called "skill point" potion doesnt need to exist just like all of the other stats they give u as potions , they already give you stats , the other couple can be just included there ,its just a fancy way of getting them and thats it, runes as well they can just give them to you by doing guardians and chaos and that it ,the horizontal its just a fancy system to get them ,or the runes could just no exist and the abilities give more of what the runes already give and thats it ,or you can reduce stagger on bossed so you dont need overwhelm and classes can tranform faster so you dont need wealth , its just a fancy system of stuff you already have to keep you occupued but its not necessary because you already have it
        So do you want non-raid content to matter or not? They have to have some reward for horizontal or else as you said it doesn’t matter. I don’t understand what you want if you don’t want the game to just be raids but also don’t want non-raid content progression to have power rewards? Some classes need those rewards or they have shit damage in raids so it’s not like those rewards don’t matter. Sure it’s a ‘fancy’ way of getting them but this is literally how video games work, you play them to progress, it’s like you guys have never played a video game before lol
            Bruh how are you so dense lol , my point is ,the only reason horizontal matters its because of the rewards , but seeing it from outside the only reason horizontal gets done are the skillpoints and some runes , as a whole horizontal doesnt matter and the game would still be the same without it , im not arguing if the stuff matters or not ,of course skillpoints matter  my point is either you do it good or you dont and horizontal content is done like shit and behind it they are gating vital resources that they can just give in any other way and bot lose vita development time on horizontal content they dont know how to do ,of course i would like horizontal content to matter z but i want it to matter in a gameplay way , not matter just because it gives u skillpoints and other stuff that its only there to progress on other horizontal stuff that is at best half baked
                If you are trying to say horizontal is shit and only required because of the skill points and runes then sure. Considering that there isn’t much required horizontal content and most people don’t play the horizontal content past what is required I doubt they will change it up much and just continue with adding small islands and events in the manner they have been doing
                    I know they will not change it because they dont need to , my point is the horizontal content is pointless and the game doesnt need it , it would still be the same game or better and the only reason it its there its because losr ark wants to mimick games like diablo and poe eithout understanding it is neither
            They should just make side content give cosmetics IMO.  You need to do quite a bit of (IMO boring) side content to max out on skill pots.  Uninteresting side content is not why I play MMOs.  I'm a min maxer though, so I dredged through them.
When I started playing the game back at launch I only had one character that I slowly pushed, I was among the last people to reach T3 of the people that started at launch because I took my time searching mokkokos and doing all the collectibles (also I changed servers and character before I reached lvl 50 too, so I missed all the Argos fiasco that people cried about)
I played only one character up until brel release almost, my character was always ready for content on release., now I started playing multiple characters but honestly it's possible to play slowly and be ready for content, it's just your gold income that will be a bit lower but other than that it's possible to play less then 6 characters.
If gold is really an issue and the feel of slower progress compared to others good solution is to just park alts at 1415-1445 range and just do raids with them and nothing else.
I don't have a +20 weapon right now so I'm "technically behind" based on some no lifers but I know I'll get there soon enough when it becomes relevant or needed, right now having a +20 brell stuff is only for flex and not needed at all for any current content.
I agree with this. LoL also has different runes/items that slightly diversify your champs playstyle and is still viable. There's really only a 2-way deviation in builds for lost ark chars and more often than not, there is a theoretical best build that significantly out-paces the other.
Wait is there actually a special Mokoko seed early game that you are supposed to find? 😂
I disagree focusing in end game raiding is bad for Lost Ark, if anything is one of the strongest points and the biggest appeal of the game. The issue is how hard and grindy can get to progress specially after Brel Raid, the cost of honing is insane and the only way to do it is doing homework with 6 characters every day.   


That's the biggest flaw in my opinion, and what make focusing in more horizontal content pointless since the grind make player ignore it. If you could gain gear progression or have a true reset in gearing this wouldn't be an issue but SG refused out of fear to do so, so they keep delaying the matter and making things worst. There is a reason even in KR people is tired of doing chaos and guardian for 4 years non stop, having no alternatives to progress towards the raid is soulcrushing.
    Players ignore horizontal content not because of the grind, but Because the return of time invested on it is puny in comparison to the raid benefits.

Why would you invest time in content outside the raids of it is not only time consuming but also borderline useless in comparison?

On top of that, add the raid problem that you just mentioned. At this point the powercreep in gear is unberable already in global, and in korea is beyond it.
So repetitive content locked behind a weekly limited rng wall for 0 gain?
    If you don't want free stuff from easy soloable voluntary content, then don't do it? I prefer that over the constant raiding hamster wheel for Gold that is Lost Ark.
        You tried giving an example for non-repetitive content and I pointed out that it is and worse then you what you were making it out to be.
            It is non-repetitive because it is voluntary, i.e. you don't have to redo old content for cosmetic stuff if you don't want to. It is a repetitive chore if you make it become a chore. In Lost Ark, you need gold for nearly everything and the only way to get gold is through Time (Legion raids) or Money (Swipe).
                It is repetitive if you want to get the thing you are hunting for which is the reason you are doing it. Just because its voluntary doesn't mean it is not repetitive and still has weekly lock outs and RNG behind it which means you could possibily never get those items.
                    Grinding cosmetics is repetitive anyways. Can sugar coat it, but it'll still be repetitive grinding. Tried a game where one outfit was locked at an abysmal 1% drop rate. Ran the dungeon 330 times for it. 

Swapping to support main instead is less stress. Easy to get into lobbies regardless. Have 3 supports and 3 alt dps. Can always use the supports to funnel the mats into 1 dps if I want to anyways.
Yeah I feel like that is a problem for most of the popular MMOs, you are in the same place most of the time and do the world exploration a few times and never look back. So a lot of beautifull maps and zones are there rotting since they are obsolete.
Maybe its a problem with the genre, I haven't played those. Im just saying how I feel about lost ark 🙂
Nail on the head mate, raids are fine but shouldn't be the single point of progression,
Buddy, it is a mmo. It is made for people looking to interact with other people. You can’t solo current raids or dungeons in WoW and FFXIV and are ilvl capped in those games too. This genre caters towards people who want to play with others, this isn’t made for solo players who have every other genre and game heavily catered towards them. MMO’s that cater to a more solo style is what kills the game cause that makes less interaction between people and no connection to the game and they just leave. Go play Genshin, PoE, or Albion or countless other titles made for you.
    Raid itself cant be substained once players count dips below critical mass, to survive it has to have  some solo content in place, or constantly reinvent the game, like battlefield or CoD.
        If a MMO doesn't have players then it is a dead game and even solo players are going to leave cause then there is no economy or no reason to play. Catering towards solo players in a MMO is the quickest way to kill MMO's cause solo players don't have any commitment and move on to new trends fast and have no connections to the community. Idk how u fail to understand the niche MMO's provide....they are not made for the solo player and never were lol
Agreed. Only have one main 1560 and I have a 1460 bard that I never play. You don’t need alts.
Ok, then maybe there is even more leeway than I thought, the players I know (who have been able to catch up and keep up playing 1 character) started playing a month after launch and spent 0 money, but my point was also that alts are NOT required to progress main, they are just required if one wants to play more, have more bifrosts / card-buying characters, and such stuff.
    Ahh yes the "I play 6 characters and I don't have any time" crowd. It's so ironic that they chose to make and play that many characters when it's not necessary.
        I choose to play multiple characters because I can and want to, I am aware I am this way actually less efficient and progress more slowly (and would only maybe be more efficient if I played an unreasonable number of hours per day or if I played in the most unfun ways) - my brother and I started at the same time, he plays half the hours per week than I, and has progressed much more quickly than I, in ilvl and even in horizontal content (in everything except roster lvl), in big part because he plays only one character. Once I finally decide on 1-2 classes I want to play the most or/and once I'll have less time, I'll likely play only 1-2 characters, if I don't quit raiding / quit entirely (by) then.
O no, you missed out on 5 Brel horns in the 15th week you’re definitely gonna quit the game now I’m sure. What makes people quit the game are the endless chores and burnouts. This is one unfortunate thing that happened to you that impacts maybe 15 min of your time, chores are 2-3 hours a day
    O no my bad, I guess I didn't read the title of OP's post and that disconnects that are surprisingly happening until now is **NOT** a big issue.

Imagine reading. Yikes.
I didn't know about that Soulfist rework.

But I think Wardancer/striker and Scrapper are too much punch already. And Soulfist is too many beams and energy balls but lacks the punchy side of Dragon Ball. They don't know how to design classes.

And they also failed at the Azena - Summoner conversion, because as you said Azena makes spears rain every second but it's one of the slowest skills for the Summoner in cast, animation and cooldown animation.
    For soulfist punchy you'd have to take out like half a tripods from Pummel and put them in a new skill because almost all martial moves are fist handwaves or hitting with our hip. Most energy attacks are also trash. It is a bit sad to see that there is 0 build variance between class engravings. Both use the same skills, tripods, spread of gems and are only distinct by small change in speed.
Ty. But don't get me started in Arthetine's classes. So much technology but apparently it all goes boom.

The Scouter could have another engraving( why only 2 branches?) where the drone can shield and reduce damage or create safe zones for the party. Or just another class that uses the drone and other devices to help the team.

People say that we don't have male mages or assassins because they need to create the body/models but they went and created the specialist classes, when we could have had more supports with the current models.

(and save this for later but the mages and assassins are going to recycle the striker/gunners' bodies)

Edit: I thought at first that the  Arcanist was a support class, with her cards being buffs for the party or nerfs for the enemy and different utilities for different situations all ruled by RNG.
Even those that do make it will not have yearning and I assume not many pugs wants to deal with that.
Brel G6 is Dps shortage
    This is not true.  I have both sups and DPS in my roster.  My sups are still instant-accepted in 5-6 runs while my DPS often end up sitting in lobbies waiting for sups...
        weds to friday is lf supp then it slowly changes to lf DPS starting around Sunday night onward from my experience
        probably because you are playing dps early in week where there is supp shortage.Later in week there are lot of support for last 2 gate.
            Nope, I don't play *either* until 'later in the week' (at least by this subreddit's standards...).  I have an actual job and don't have time to run a bunch of raids on Wednesdays.  The majority of my raids happen on the weekend.
Only the people already doing that content on supports lol. There may be a few outliers who switch to support main because of artist, but it won't be the majority.
Not really, I think almost every MMO, specially RPGs, requires some sort of player interaction or grouping. I think you are just playing the wrong game. If you don't want interaction, play an RPG.
Korean games never change their mind b4 playerbase goes to shit. 

 Just look at KR with how they treat new players and Card set gatekeeping? 1490 express when current content is 1600+ and a scuffed LoS clone instead of making LoS 18 baseline or reworking cards completly. Ontop of being too greedy to give new players 5x3 for 2-3 months. 4x3 no LoS 20 roster ppl surely gonna get into brels. No rewards to help new players in raids etc.
    Yeah. It's a shame bc this game has such an amazing foundational setup of controls, art style and gameplay mechanics.

It's just so bogged down by legacy system clutter, upgrade system inflation and stubborn anti-player grind.

And on top, the grind for currency lacks sufficient break points, so new players at entry ilvl have to compete for party spots against established endgame players and their armada of alts.
        The inflation part of upgrading is slowly killing my desire to continue even though i mostly enjoy the game. I'm only honing one brel character while generating mats from 4  characters regularly and its still not enough. Then we also have to generate mats for fuzion material while also spending gold to craft it. Why does it cost gold to craft something on top of the activity energy? The inflated cost of upgrading a character encourages RMT.
        Anti-player while simultaneously being pro-revenue generating 🤣
            The top 10% probably spends more than the remaining 90%.
            Do you truly think that’s a contradiction? If so, you learned nothing from Diablo Immortal and all the other games that prioritize their monetization over longevity and offered quality. Lost Ark makes more money by squeezing idiots dry who drop the game soon afterwards than by cultivating a long term low spending player base.

So yeah, it is often very much anti player to be pro maximized revenue. Hell, it almost always is.
    I was always curious whether KR had a gatekeeping problem also, I guess it's just a problem of the game.. but they should figure out a way to get people to wanna help new players with some kind of reward or what not.
Yeah and for people that have jobs you quickly realize you can buy 50k gold for 15 bucks.. just demotivates you even more to do homework. If I really liked the raids I’d log in to do those then buy 50k gold a week to keep up with progression. Boom just solved the time issue with lost ark.
If they actually were forced to play their own game I bet they would change their mind.
Then create more characters

&#x200B;

Why are you for more homework ?
    Why so I can get burnt out and complain like everyone in this thread? Lol I will be soon with express pass. I like doing all of the daily stuff there’s nothing wrong with me enjoying it. You don’t HAVE to do it. You also get rested bonus…
This attitude about content makes players realize their time is being wasted, though. The reward in proportion to time spent is just too low.

And once people realize this, they are just one step away from quitting.
    the biggest lost ark lie told by streamers: "Lost ark respects your time"
Albione online is great. Played it for a long time.

The good thing about albion is that there is no time commitment unless you do zvz. And zvz is kinda meh, i never liked it.

So unless you do zvz, hell - you can just do whatever u want and whenever u want.

No dailies, no weeklies, nothing you " have " to do.

The only issue with the game is that when ur veteran, you dont have much to do. Its when u like level up everything u need, when ur so rich that loot doesnt really mean anything like it used to - eh.

I had lot of fun with the game. The potential for epic moments in it is high, especially if you play solo and if you use the game mechanics against others. Used to make some vids here and there - here one funny moment of baiting people :D [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpSYykrEQzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpSYykrEQzQ)
    hooly shitoe haha that looks fun. I'm actually great with that kind of expiration date, end-game in mmos is overrated.
Gatekeeping is the same as getting solar stuff and books in improving honing RNG, becuz it has no pity system, a group can fail infinitely etc. Higher ilevel/item =/= automatic clear but rather like a RNG boost in honing, it reduce the chance of failure.
I’ve been playing Sons of the Forest and valorant.
    Recently went back to eldenring ring. Lost ark is.

    Sounds like an user problem.
Hahhahah mine all over 1520 but i only play 5 char and if i got time i do weekly on 6th one, and yeah getting title help a lot and its the diff betweeen 1 hour bre and 5 hour bre. It also help i got 2 sup which dont need much invest yet so i can pump everytjing into my dps.
You have four characters? l2read and stop being so madge?
    Yes and I did my first alt when my main was around 1490 out of boredom even without them I would have more than enough silver. Then you should stop spreading missinformation and quit the game or learn how to spend your recourses or stop getting catched by FOMO. If you want everything in a week like many of the other whiny guys here then play a shooter or smth but not a MMO.
That's basically where I'm at. The weekly homework doesn't feel great after beating it so many times. It was fun beating valtan close to ilvl, but now it's just boring, and you end up spending more time in PF because people still gate keep.
I ran Argos bus the other day, and one of the passengers was a 1370 mokoko bard with an okay build, and she played with us doing normal bard stuff and did the mechanics too. So sad that she had to pay 1500g for the privilege of just doing the raid normally as a new player. And "funny" thing is that she was lucky to not get gatekept from even joining the bus, some drivers I ran with refused to take mokokos because they don't know how to use AH (fair enough).
    Isn’t there also a trusted status restriction on the AH? So it is reasonable to think that a mokoko player wouldn’t have a trusted account. So they may know how to use AH but can’t? This is what I have heard, I don’t keep track of these things though.
Well I'm in the opinion that buses are fine (I bus from time to time). I just want unlimited entries for raids cuz I want to do them when I'm bored. I don't want lock outs. 

But unlimited entries= unlimited buses so that's what they'll have to tackle. Or tbh if it's unlimited entry there might be too much competition for bussing and prices would be down?
    Heck, some players might just start joining old raids for fun or even carrying friends or guildies if they could run the same raid multiple times on the same character. People freak out about unlimited runs = unlimited busses, but it really weakens the power of a busser when other people can just fill that slot.
    >But unlimited entries= unlimited buses so that's what they'll have to tackle. Or tbh if it's unlimited entry there might be too much competition for bussing and prices would be down?

Unlimited busses capitulates on itself. Prices would become extremely low and filling a bus would take even longer than it does now because of how many other lobbies there would be.
    No lockout are coming in the next KR update right? So next year you’ll have no lockouts lol
        No there's still lock outs lol. They just removed the 3 legion raids limiter. You can still only enter valtan once per week with one character.
    Final fantasy ran into this issue and aside from their content being _usually_ harder to bus for large numbers, what it simply does is make the reward structure go like this:

- If you clear with all 8 players new to the raid or haven't consumed their weekly lockout, 2 chests of loot.

- if 1-4 player has already cleared this week, only 1 chest drops.

- If 5-8 players have already cleared, no chest drops.

You can just do your own 2 chest run as a seasoned player then simply join a friend in a learning or prog party, they'll get 1 chest or zero chest, but clearing the raid gives a guaranteed drop which counts towards their gear progression. The chests are more akin to the box we buy after raid clear from the side menu in lost ark.

Would people be against getting a vykas clear if it only meant they don't get to buy the chest and double their wings? I think a lot of people would be, and it's a shame that Lost Ark's answer isn't to strike a middle ground but rather just declare open warfare against the idea of player choice repetition.
They’re already getting boosted, its irrelevant.
    but now other will be incentivised to boost too with that compensation. yum yum
        The bots are already paying really well, people who dont care are already incentivized.

You’re willfully ignoring that this allows many mokokos to actually get to play the game, be helped and feel like part of the community, your “worries” are already happening.
Stick to yoho, trust me.
    Not sure what you mean
    Deska is way easier and I get much better teammates too. When I was doing yoho we would constantly fail. Fuck that
        ...you can't do deskaluda at 1400. Velganos is cancer in a pug setting. So stick to Yoho until 1415.
Busing is the way to retain new player to give them hope and progression to look forward to, of cuz smilegate likes it and encourages it, more players retained more possiblity of swipe, why not. A raid structure like lost ark, if without busing will die out pretty fast.
    Or you create an incentive that encourages seasoned players to help new players. FF14 has a random queue that gives extra rewards, so you queue into low level dungeons but get the same rewards. A mentorship program could be added to the game. FF14 has that as well, and mentors get rewards. I've heard not all people who sign up are good mentors, but the company is trying.
        Idk what smilegate will do, certainly thats possible if player count start to thin out. All raid mmo goes throughthe same thing/path, the other easy way is to move group wipe to hard/hell level, like different tier with different loot.
I think it's fine to criticize AGS in this case. AGS could have tweeted "we're actively working on the bussing issue with SG." Instead they tweeted a cartoon that said "tip your driver".
    Well, we don't know the nature of their contract with SG, and will likely never will.

Maybe they're in a position where they can't even mention it. I wouldn't be surprised, tbh.
I never said that you were wrong. I said that it's clear you only play p2w mmos that are designed to punish f2p players and are willing to guzzle it down. But that's just the state of anything f2p. That's why I stick to ff 14. I pay 15 a month and play a solid mmo that respects my time, doesn't punish new players, and puts everyone on the same playing field with no monetary advantages besides buying level ups.
The reason I came here is because I wanted to see the state of things because Lost Ark DOES have pretty damn good combat, visuals, and presentation and I wanted to see if it was worth it to come back. Your absurd comment, among other things, just made me feel gross and not want to even log in again. So back to ff 14 I go.
Yes but my point is , those skillpoints can just be givem to you as you level up , the so called "skill point" potion doesnt need to exist just like all of the other stats they give u as potions , they already give you stats , the other couple can be just included there ,its just a fancy way of getting them and thats it, runes as well they can just give them to you by doing guardians and chaos and that it ,the horizontal its just a fancy system to get them ,or the runes could just no exist and the abilities give more of what the runes already give and thats it ,or you can reduce stagger on bossed so you dont need overwhelm and classes can tranform faster so you dont need wealth , its just a fancy system of stuff you already have to keep you occupued but its not necessary because you already have it
    So do you want non-raid content to matter or not? They have to have some reward for horizontal or else as you said it doesn’t matter. I don’t understand what you want if you don’t want the game to just be raids but also don’t want non-raid content progression to have power rewards? Some classes need those rewards or they have shit damage in raids so it’s not like those rewards don’t matter. Sure it’s a ‘fancy’ way of getting them but this is literally how video games work, you play them to progress, it’s like you guys have never played a video game before lol
        Bruh how are you so dense lol , my point is ,the only reason horizontal matters its because of the rewards , but seeing it from outside the only reason horizontal gets done are the skillpoints and some runes , as a whole horizontal doesnt matter and the game would still be the same without it , im not arguing if the stuff matters or not ,of course skillpoints matter  my point is either you do it good or you dont and horizontal content is done like shit and behind it they are gating vital resources that they can just give in any other way and bot lose vita development time on horizontal content they dont know how to do ,of course i would like horizontal content to matter z but i want it to matter in a gameplay way , not matter just because it gives u skillpoints and other stuff that its only there to progress on other horizontal stuff that is at best half baked
            If you are trying to say horizontal is shit and only required because of the skill points and runes then sure. Considering that there isn’t much required horizontal content and most people don’t play the horizontal content past what is required I doubt they will change it up much and just continue with adding small islands and events in the manner they have been doing
                I know they will not change it because they dont need to , my point is the horizontal content is pointless and the game doesnt need it , it would still be the same game or better and the only reason it its there its because losr ark wants to mimick games like diablo and poe eithout understanding it is neither
        They should just make side content give cosmetics IMO.  You need to do quite a bit of (IMO boring) side content to max out on skill pots.  Uninteresting side content is not why I play MMOs.  I'm a min maxer though, so I dredged through them.
Players ignore horizontal content not because of the grind, but Because the return of time invested on it is puny in comparison to the raid benefits.

Why would you invest time in content outside the raids of it is not only time consuming but also borderline useless in comparison?

On top of that, add the raid problem that you just mentioned. At this point the powercreep in gear is unberable already in global, and in korea is beyond it.
If you don't want free stuff from easy soloable voluntary content, then don't do it? I prefer that over the constant raiding hamster wheel for Gold that is Lost Ark.
    You tried giving an example for non-repetitive content and I pointed out that it is and worse then you what you were making it out to be.
        It is non-repetitive because it is voluntary, i.e. you don't have to redo old content for cosmetic stuff if you don't want to. It is a repetitive chore if you make it become a chore. In Lost Ark, you need gold for nearly everything and the only way to get gold is through Time (Legion raids) or Money (Swipe).
            It is repetitive if you want to get the thing you are hunting for which is the reason you are doing it. Just because its voluntary doesn't mean it is not repetitive and still has weekly lock outs and RNG behind it which means you could possibily never get those items.
                Grinding cosmetics is repetitive anyways. Can sugar coat it, but it'll still be repetitive grinding. Tried a game where one outfit was locked at an abysmal 1% drop rate. Ran the dungeon 330 times for it. 

Swapping to support main instead is less stress. Easy to get into lobbies regardless. Have 3 supports and 3 alt dps. Can always use the supports to funnel the mats into 1 dps if I want to anyways.
Raid itself cant be substained once players count dips below critical mass, to survive it has to have  some solo content in place, or constantly reinvent the game, like battlefield or CoD.
    If a MMO doesn't have players then it is a dead game and even solo players are going to leave cause then there is no economy or no reason to play. Catering towards solo players in a MMO is the quickest way to kill MMO's cause solo players don't have any commitment and move on to new trends fast and have no connections to the community. Idk how u fail to understand the niche MMO's provide....they are not made for the solo player and never were lol
Ahh yes the "I play 6 characters and I don't have any time" crowd. It's so ironic that they chose to make and play that many characters when it's not necessary.
    I choose to play multiple characters because I can and want to, I am aware I am this way actually less efficient and progress more slowly (and would only maybe be more efficient if I played an unreasonable number of hours per day or if I played in the most unfun ways) - my brother and I started at the same time, he plays half the hours per week than I, and has progressed much more quickly than I, in ilvl and even in horizontal content (in everything except roster lvl), in big part because he plays only one character. Once I finally decide on 1-2 classes I want to play the most or/and once I'll have less time, I'll likely play only 1-2 characters, if I don't quit raiding / quit entirely (by) then.
O no my bad, I guess I didn't read the title of OP's post and that disconnects that are surprisingly happening until now is **NOT** a big issue.

Imagine reading. Yikes.
For soulfist punchy you'd have to take out like half a tripods from Pummel and put them in a new skill because almost all martial moves are fist handwaves or hitting with our hip. Most energy attacks are also trash. It is a bit sad to see that there is 0 build variance between class engravings. Both use the same skills, tripods, spread of gems and are only distinct by small change in speed.
This is not true.  I have both sups and DPS in my roster.  My sups are still instant-accepted in 5-6 runs while my DPS often end up sitting in lobbies waiting for sups...
    weds to friday is lf supp then it slowly changes to lf DPS starting around Sunday night onward from my experience

Idk what smilegate will do, certainly thats possible if player count start to thin out. All raid mmo goes throughthe same thing/path, the other easy way is to move group wipe to hard/hell level, like different tier with different loot.
Bruh how are you so dense lol , my point is ,the only reason horizontal matters its because of the rewards , but seeing it from outside the only reason horizontal gets done are the skillpoints and some runes , as a whole horizontal doesnt matter and the game would still be the same without it , im not arguing if the stuff matters or not ,of course skillpoints matter  my point is either you do it good or you dont and horizontal content is done like shit and behind it they are gating vital resources that they can just give in any other way and bot lose vita development time on horizontal content they dont know how to do ,of course i would like horizontal content to matter z but i want it to matter in a gameplay way , not matter just because it gives u skillpoints and other stuff that its only there to progress on other horizontal stuff that is at best half baked
    If you are trying to say horizontal is shit and only required because of the skill points and runes then sure. Considering that there isn’t much required horizontal content and most people don’t play the horizontal content past what is required I doubt they will change it up much and just continue with adding small islands and events in the manner they have been doing
        I know they will not change it because they dont need to , my point is the horizontal content is pointless and the game doesnt need it , it would still be the same game or better and the only reason it its there its because losr ark wants to mimick games like diablo and poe eithout understanding it is neither
They should just make side content give cosmetics IMO.  You need to do quite a bit of (IMO boring) side content to max out on skill pots.  Uninteresting side content is not why I play MMOs.  I'm a min maxer though, so I dredged through them.
It is non-repetitive because it is voluntary, i.e. you don't have to redo old content for cosmetic stuff if you don't want to. It is a repetitive chore if you make it become a chore. In Lost Ark, you need gold for nearly everything and the only way to get gold is through Time (Legion raids) or Money (Swipe).
    It is repetitive if you want to get the thing you are hunting for which is the reason you are doing it. Just because its voluntary doesn't mean it is not repetitive and still has weekly lock outs and RNG behind it which means you could possibily never get those items.
        Grinding cosmetics is repetitive anyways. Can sugar coat it, but it'll still be repetitive grinding. Tried a game where one outfit was locked at an abysmal 1% drop rate. Ran the dungeon 330 times for it. 

Swapping to support main instead is less stress. Easy to get into lobbies regardless. Have 3 supports and 3 alt dps. Can always use the supports to funnel the mats into 1 dps if I want to anyways.
Nope, I don't play *either* until 'later in the week' (at least by this subreddit's standards...).  I have an actual job and don't have time to run a bunch of raids on Wednesdays.  The majority of my raids happen on the weekend.
The top 10% probably spends more than the remaining 90%.
Do you truly think that’s a contradiction? If so, you learned nothing from Diablo Immortal and all the other games that prioritize their monetization over longevity and offered quality. Lost Ark makes more money by squeezing idiots dry who drop the game soon afterwards than by cultivating a long term low spending player base.

So yeah, it is often very much anti player to be pro maximized revenue. Hell, it almost always is.
