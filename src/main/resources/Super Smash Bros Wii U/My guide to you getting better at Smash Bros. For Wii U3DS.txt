[[My guide to you getting better at Smash Bros. For Wii U3DS]]


So a lot of people have been wond-- I mean guessing, how do you get better at Smash 4? Well I started playing competitively like two months ago and I am still not the best player, but I have improved a lot. 

I want to give you guys a lot of tips that will help you through this journey. Here are the rules, before you ask anything:

**Rule Number 1: Don't Play For Glory**

A lot of people think that this is a viable option but it is not. In For Glory, you see, you'll mostly encounter **people who aren't into competitive smashing, nor have an idea of how competitive play goes**. If you train here you will start copying your opponent's habits, because your muscle memory hasn't developed. 

Things like rolling, smash attacks and always trying to spike after you knock out your opponent out of the stage is to be commonly seen here.

Trust me, this one night I was desperate to get good at smash 4 and decided to stay all night playing For Glory to get better. Result? I just got worse. My timing got worse because of the lag, and my muscle memory was horrible. I started rolling more often than not, and I was getting punished for it everytime. Lesson? For Glory is toxic.

Now you may have been asking to yourself, "But why do people like StylesX2 or ZeRo do For Glory series and don't get worse?" - easy my friend. These people have been practicing a lot so they don't lose their muscle memory that easily.

Speaking of muscle memory, the first few days you begin to train you will feel like you learned a lot one day, but know nothing the next day. This is normal, just take as a reference what I said about muscle memory being, fragile, so to speak, when you begin practicing.

**Rule number 2: Always ask "why?".**

If you ever find yourself having trouble in a match, **stop using your hands for a second, and start thinking.** "Why did I get hit by that Mario's upsmash?" -

 In this case, the answer would be impatience to go punish your opponent or using a bad move, like Mario's nair who would be very unsafe when not close to your opponent, due to its lack of range.

**And finally rule number 3: Always try new things.**

You see, as we have seen before, muscle memory is quite one of the hardest things to master in Smash Bros. If you keep doing the same combos, the same DI, the same air dodges, these will end up being a part of yourself, and can sometimes be really, **really hard to get out of that pesky muscle memory!**

I recommend you to watch videos of people who play your character. Me, as a Mario main, discovered that Ally uses the next things to approach: grabs, back airs, fireballs to grab. 

Ask yourself, why did that competitive player do that move? Try doing it! If a competitive player does it on a regular basis, can it really be that bad?


-----------------------------------------------

Okay now that the rules are out of the way, I'm gonna let you know how to get into the competitive scene. First of all, accept that you have a lot to learn, and be open to being criticized and or having to change your playstyle.

Then, to what you've all been waiting for, training, I recommend anther's ladder and (obviously) tournaments. Try looking up on facebook a Smash bros group on your area, I'm sure you'll find local tournaments.

Now another thing is to watch your replays. Not the ones where you JV3 that For Glory scrub, but rather the ones where YOU are that scrub.

 An important thing to always focus on is the neutral game. Save the replay and then ask yourself: "Why didn't my approach work?" the answers could be different

1. You're not spacing well your attacks as an approach

2. You're being predictable, because you've repeated that so much even your grandma expects it.

3. You're not doing at the right moment. Try to think what the opponent thinks. If you were him and you did that attack, what would you next? How would you **FEEL** at that time? Would you feel **unsafe?** **Safe** to do an approach? And then compare to what he did next.

Now to read opponents here's the best advice I can give.

This is my thought process.

1. ***Focus*** on each and every single movement my opponent makes, especially the **riskier** moves, like smash attacks.

2. Then try to feel what they're **thinking**. If you were them? Why would you do that in the first place, if your opponent is you?

3. And finally, next time they're gonna do something, **take a wild guess**. Yes, you heard me, take a wild guess. 

Just try to predict what the opponent will do without much thinking. Maybe it'll be correct, maybe it'll be wrong, but I assure you, at one point you're gonna be correct and only then you will start to get inside the mind of your opponent. 

After that, you'll start to 'guess' their next move more and more, and before you know it, you're already in the lead now.

Thanks for reading redditors.

Frankly, I disagree with your For Glory assertion, just look at Nairo's advice! At least for me(someone who doesn't train with his friends or at tournies but instead trains alone so he can later surprise an wreck them), For Glory is an essential testing ground. As long as nothing else is sapping my internet, my connection is usually perfect, it just takes finding an opponent with a good connection aswell(usually the first 2 tries is enough). So For Glory basically feels like it would in person.

If I want to try a new tactic, whether it be style, spacing, approaching, etc. I go in to training mode, and I practice it normally for a half hour to an hour. Then, I go on For Glory and switch from opponent to opponent to see if it's at all viable. I see if it improves my success rate by comparing my Win Rate for my recent games vs. my previous Win Rate from old games(I often accomplish this by using a new name and checking the most recent one.) And I have found this method is the only reason I've become the best in my group of friends and is the only reason I've kept up at tournaments.
    Sure it's not as good as playing against someone in the same room, but at the end of the day it is still playing and familiarizing yourself with the controls of the game, which is pretty important.

Anthers Ladder is probably better for serious improvement, but For Glory is fine if you don't put tooo much stock in it.
        For glory is also great for learning a lot of matchup knowledge.  Yes, many players won't do the optimal thing, but you might be surprised by what they can do with their own play style.  By fighting these players and the ones who go for optimal play,you learn how to handle both situations.
            Yeah, being able to adapt and react is really important, and that's not something that lag will really effect.
                Yep.  As a falcon main,I don't really play the optimal way, and I throw out a lot of moves with long end lag, but try to do so in a way that's at least moderately safe.  Yes, I get punished hard by this sometimes, but more often than not, it can lead to a lot of wins because people don't react and adapt properly.  If right as you land you go for a hit when I'm near, i can abuse the fuck out of that by falcon kicking when you're just about to land.  It's hilarious to see that sometimes it takes people 5-6 falcon kicks, in a row, before they decide to do something different.
        The unfortunate thing is some people can't use anthers whether it be because their computers broken or they have no access to their console and computer at the same time, so For Glory is basically their only option.

I'd be using Anthers right now, personally, but I don't have a computer and my mobile device is so bad it crashes the app every once in a while. With that, I'm stuck against the same playstyles on For Glory with the occasional player from Anthers or something showing up.
        @maxrdt

For Glory is if you're not serious and IF you're an experienced player. You won't get much out of For Glory if you're an experienced player

If you're a newbie you will just get bad muscle memory and habits.
            A poor player would develop poor habits regardless of where/how/who he played. Alternatively, a great player will improve in the exact same circumstances.
            There are some good players on FG. You just have to be able to find them and then stick it out. They're usually on later in the evening or at night on weekdays, and more often on weekends I find. I agree that  it's not always the best when you're relatively experienced, but when you keep switching opponents and then find someone who challenges you with close games every time, it can make for some great training. 
    im in the same boat as you, sometimes ill go anthers and sometimes ill challenge streamers but thats about the extent of it. despite mlg being in new orleans this past weekend theres no competitive smash scene here that im aware of. wanna play some time?
    Well in all honesty, that might work for Nairo because going to For Glory doesn't affect his muscle memory. As I've stated before, For Glory is toxic if you're a newbie, your muscle memory gets really changed. I'm not just pointing this out because I read it somewhere, it's actual personal experience.

I can see that working because you spend so much time working on a technique and then SPECIFICALLY testing that technique on random people. But would it work on tournament players aswell? No, it would not. There are a lot of things that work on newbies but don't on experienced players.

That perfectly works for Nairo but keep in mind this is intended for new players, not experienced players. If you're experienced and practice frequently, going to For Glory may have a little bit of use when trying to do general test around, but not optimal. If you're going to a tournament, don't you think it's way more logical to test things on **tournament** players rather than *For Glory* players?
        For Glory players are not different than tournament players. A good player is a good player, regardless of his/her practice method. It's not that different on For Glory vs. a low-lag opponent than it is in person. What really matters is how well you pay attention to the match and your habits. Muscle memory can be perfected in training mode, but consciousness needs a live opponent. For Glory satisfies that need, and your stereotyping of For Glory players is nothing but superstition.
        For the record, I have an 87% FG win rate in the last 500 matches. I have 7500 matches under my belt. It's 99% of my training, and I occasionally dabble in Anther's for different stages and stick to around Gold rating with Mac alone. Got 2nd at a small local tourney of 25 really experienced players last month. It's very underrated in my opinion, provided that you have a good connection. Just my two cents. Of course, you need to keep searching for challenging players and then sticking around with them first to get anywhere.
Thank you! I will take in all of this. I honestly didn't think about how the toxicity of FG is contagious and would rub off on me. That explains a lot. Here's a question though, would it be better to train with someone on here or is there a sub/trainer I go to? 

Lately I've been through many characters I've considered to be "mains" (since launch I've gone through almost the entire roster) and they've all gone through the process of going from "I'm doing excellent" to "FUCKING HELL I SUCK!" then up to sub par. I really miss my Lucina :/
    Not OP, but 2 things:

1) For Glory isn't bad if you're using it as a way to start to learn a character, so you can get used to their movement/abilities before playing someone of a much higher skill level. That being said, once you are past this stage I would highly recommend going on anther's ladder and/or tournaments

2) I've gone through a ton of mains too, and I've tried many secondaries while having them so I get what you're saying. What you want to do is pick one character that you like for whatever reason (It can be a stupid reason and the character doesn't have to be high on the tier list) and just play them. Accept the fact that there are people much better than you and when you lose, just keep playing. Try to watch high level play of that character and try to pick up on what they're doing; how are they spacing, what combos are they pulling off, stuff like that. If you stick with a character for long enough, you can get pretty good fairly quick.

Lastly, I'd recommend checking out Zero's latest video on tips to improve yourself. They're really simple but I've already improved a ton after watching it
    my advice on the second part of your comment, well maybe it's not advice, I'm just sharing my experience: have different character choices ready for when you're playing not as well.  I'll try to explain by telling you about me.  I'm a Pikachu main in Smash 4.  When I'm playing well and precise, I'm great with Pika.  Snapping to the ledge like it's nothing, deadly quick attack approaches, reading DI into thunder kills, etc. Sometimes I'm off though, just a bit, and I do stupid shit like kill myself at 0 by missing the ledge or missing myself with a thunder off stage, or otherwise letting my fragile Pika stocks evaporate too quickly.  In this case, I play Pit.  He is more forgiving (multi-jumps, big recovery), heavier, and has easy grab follow ups at any percent.  His neutral is one dimensional (unlike Pika) and his smash attacks are quick enough to easily punish after a read. In a perfect world I'd play Pikachu every time.  But I've been nervous at tournaments before and killing yourself twice in 30 seconds is embarrassing. Switching to Pit because of sloppy play has actually won me sets.  More boring play-style, but I need the option sometimes.  It's like how Melee Fox players will sometimes have to fall back on a simpler character because they just can't get the timing for Fox's movements on that particular day.
Thanks!!! I'm not very good so I will follow this advice 
I disagree with the assertion that For Glory shouldn't ever be played - no, it's not a sub for actual tournament play, but at the same time, it's good for solo practicing when you can't get another person to play with at the time. Not all, or even most, of the players on it are good, but there are good players there and it's always good to get different experiences.


I'm surprised and happy you didn't just put Git Gud in and called it a day.
My guide: Have fun 
Your first rule is irrelevant, Nairo's secret is Doctor Mario and For Glory Kappa
Decent guide but I disagree somewhat. There are some skilled and non toxic players on FG. True it may take a few rounds to find one. When latency is good the delay is minor. There is nothing wrong with getting some practice or goofing around on there. 

Yes the latency can throw off muscle memory but you shouldn't play exclusively FG going in to a tournament. Most can easily readjust in just a few sessions or less. It is always easier transitioning to less input delay. Train it out with friends or Anther's the days leading up to the tournament. People have a plethora of playstyles on FG, exposure to any style you can find is always a good thing. Sure FG isn't ideal and this sub loves to rip on it. It is a decent way to find a quick match vs a variety of skill levels if you have a decent connection. 
Sure it's not as good as playing against someone in the same room, but at the end of the day it is still playing and familiarizing yourself with the controls of the game, which is pretty important.

Anthers Ladder is probably better for serious improvement, but For Glory is fine if you don't put tooo much stock in it.
