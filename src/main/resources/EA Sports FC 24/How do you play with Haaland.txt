[[How do you play with Haaland]]


I got him from the 85+ TOTW pack and i have absolutely no idea how to use him when I can't play through balls or finish inside the box. Any advice on how to make him not move like a dumptruck when he receives the ball with his back to the goal?
I'm Div 2 on Next Gen if that helps.


You surround him by enough good players to create chances for him. He will never be good on the ball. He is good for counters and jammy bullshit goals in the box and that’s it. He will score at least 1 goal a game for free like no other player in the game can, but he will also just be in the way the rest of the game.
haaland is the most overrated and on point player in the game. he can’t move left or right. he can’t handle press other than hitting the gas and sprinting but now everyone has elite CBs that don’t get out run. he’s got a useless WF and shitty passing.

however, when you have explosive/controlled players everywhere else and can break press without him, he makes Incredible Hulk runs and can get you some big time attacks.

the problem is that his “jam” is more luck than what mbappe brings especially because the level of player has to be worse to struggle against them.

no player have I had 1v1 chances to brick with than his 88, 89 and 90. better to use explosive and controlled and learn to NASCAR with them. they maneuver better and high rated explosive players can get in and out with massive speed over and over if you manage sprints.
    Yeah this tracks with how my WL goes. 90% of my opponents using Haaland and their entire attack is booting it forward to him. Over and over and over. Every once in a while they'd get through but generally I can score more often than they'd get lucky. Now that I'm used to it I'm winning more but fuck me it's boring.
    I fully agee. His shooting is amazing but that and running are his only skills unfortunately. I'll probably use him as a sub and get dzeko rulebreaker back in
        Plus he wrestles down anyone. Defenders bounce off him.
Haaland is a counter-attack merchant, if you don't play counter attack then no point forcing him in.
    Probably a good call, he's been driving me crazy in champs
Counter and lobbed through ball. That's it.

I put him in an SBC after packing him untradeable because he was so boring to play with.
I have tried him but he just doesn't fit my style. I was subbing him in at ST with that Almada storyline card behind him at CF and Almada was severely outscoring Haaland. I think if you're planning on doing more than running in a straight line there are probably better options.
    Same for me, I'm just not a counter attacking player at all. The thing is his scoring hasn't even been that bad but everytime he has the ball in a tight space i lose the ball because his passing and dribbling are absolutely horrible. I was using Dzeko rulebreaker before him and he was absolutely amazing, much more agile
        Are you on old gen? I'm looking for an alternative to Haaland as well, considering Dzeko
Run and powershot my friend run like someone is hunting you down and be a master of powershots from every range that haaland can score from the half yard in Fantasy mode with power shot :D
I am not a counter attack merch and I use his red, finished 19-1 this weekend and am elite, he’s a good target man never try to turn unless it’s obvious enough to be able too, and when he gets the ball at feet when running possession style football like myself run bursts into space not going toward goal it throws people off creates a lot of space and the one two you play with him from it will quickly get him into a scoring position once you get the final pass to him. Gllllll
    Thanks for commenting, this is excactly the kind of advice I was looking for. My problem is that I often flnd myself in situations where i have noone to pass to without turning (which he can't do). Any tips on how to get out of situations like these other than avoiding them in the first place?
        Well believe it or not if you get the ball and R1 turn it could help open that space to turn to those people and pass, for instance say he has ball at feet and there is an obvious run being made by your lw kinda fade toward that option but quickly switch the rw side and pass to the open player there, if you bait obvious passes when your r1 turn the other way and pass it almost always works.
If you cant play him as a ST, put him on the wing and sprint every time you see an open space. He is the only card on new gen that can be a pace merchant
    Interesting idea, have you tried it?
    That's false.
Chipped through ball and shoot.
I've had him in my starting lineup for over 100 games, wish I had sold him when i packed him and his price was 250k.   


Having said that, if you play him in a 2 striker formation with a more agile striker than Haaland can be a really good player. His strength, speed, and height is great for holding up play. Whenever I send long passes or crosses his way he wins them 99% of the time. Also attack-wise on through -balls in 1v1 situations he's very solid and holds his own.  


Overall, I would just focus on his strengths like holding up play, winning headers, 1v1 runs. And avoid excess dribbling and difficult passes.
he is very fast. I try Dzeko which should be similar but haaland clearly faster. When u have a team that has LW, RW, and a CAM is explosive type, it good to have 1 striker with controlled/lengthy.

IF haaland have space, use through ball or lob pass to make him run and scorce

IF no space, just play with RW, LW, CAM and let Haaland or CAM tap in.
Sub him on when getting pressed and spam him long balls headers and through balls in behind
Spam L2 to body players when on a run and you jostling with a defender
1- Play this and put it on repeat [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnD3eWQ9x0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYnD3eWQ9x0)

2- Spam over the top through balls

Done
Use Morientes instead.
Only thing he is good at is abusing broken lenghty system and running behind a lobbed through ball. I packed him last week, hoping to get a lot out of him but sold because he is useless in buildup play
Try to learn how to play with him and if he doesn't work for you, get a different striker.
I use him as ML because of the trivelas and no nobody can beat him in counter atacks, he helps with passes sometimes too.
I realy hate him as ST. 
Formation 442 (2) div 2
You work your team up field and give him the ball in or around the box, he'll find the space. Left or right foot it's going in.
    You’re giving his right foot more credit than it’s worth tbh
You don't play with Haaland.

You play over and to him.
