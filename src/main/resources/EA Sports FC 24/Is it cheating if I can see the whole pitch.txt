[[Is it cheating if I can see the whole pitch]]





I'm 100% sure I would lose every game on this monitor lmao
    Mate, try co op camera angle. It‚Äôs pretty zoomed out but you can see both touch lines. It‚Äôs like playing the game on easy mode, fullbacks bombing forward constantly unamarked. Complete games changer. Defending is bit harder tho
        Yep. Read a comment during Fifa 19 about Co-op. Gave it a go and never looked back. So refreshing and the game feels much less claustrophobic.
            I‚Äôve played on co-op with zoom min and height max since I started ever playing pro clubs, such an advantage
            what settings (zoom & height) do you use on this camera?
                I use co-op with 0 zoom and 20 height, definitely the best settings for it imo
                    I just switched to this setting from default last night and the game is legitimately more fun to play
                    Yes! I thought I was the only one.
                    Problem with co_op is it don't work with two players just ai
                        Why doesn't it work with 2 players?
                        It works with two players, it just means you don't have the same advantage because the other person can see a majority of the pitch too
                        yeah i'd rather not with multi.
                I‚Äôll have to double check but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just default. Don‚Äôt remember messing with it when I changed to co-op.
                Im pretty sure i use hieght 10  and zoom 12
            Agreed. Also being able to see the touch lines is awesome for switching the ball. It makes any kind of agile dribbling tougher and I have to sit a bit closer to my tv. But it is a great camera. The less claustrophobic point is a good one.
        I‚Äôd recommend anyone who is learning how to defend  to use the co-op camera as it will teach you to cover dangerous passes and through balls. It also teaches you to right stick switch properly as 1. You‚Äôll see a dangerous through ball early that you‚Äôll have to manually switch constantly to cover it and 2. As you are zoomed out I feel there is more margin for error with the right stick as your players are more spread apart on the screen.

Once you get the hang of defending, I suggest Tele Broadcast solely for dribbling, skill moves and to judge tackles more accurately.
            I‚Äôm finding dribbling in the box so much easier on co op, think it just feels like I have so much more passing options so I slow  my Play down. Just tackling aggressively  which Is hard
        Can‚Äôt dribble the same way on co op as you can on tele broadcast. There‚Äôs a reason the best in the world (tekkz, anders) play on tele broadcast.
            but you arent the best jn the world
                But if I‚Äôm an e1 player then I‚Äôm going to play better in the camera angle where I can more accurately dribble and get the angles that I need. Don‚Äôt get me wrong co op definitely makes defending and seeing some passing angles much easier. But if you feel like your good at defending I think tele broadcast is better
                    I agree with you, although I'm not as good as you, I used co-op for a while, and whilst seeing the extra pitch was immensely helpful, dribbling was harder and just in the end was counter productive
                    Still ... get gud. U ain‚Äôt gnna be elite ever. Perhaps focus on school
                        It‚Äôs winter break bro last thing I wanna think about is accounting
                            bro schools are starting agian
                                Don‚Äôt start till the 25th - hopefully enough time to will myself to do the SB icon swaps
                                    The goalkeeper trick works well.
                I‚Äôm in division 1 on seasons, AMA
            read this the other day and after years of co-op decided to give it a go. Unreal, best dribbling I‚Äôve ever done, undefeated since switching. I still make a few bad passes to players off screen but make up for it w/ far more accurate dribbling/passing/defending
            [deleted]
                Absolutely not true. Alekzandur, hektic Jukez, joksan, maxe vip, ajax Joey and Crackheber all play on tele broadcast. 6 out of the top na pros just to name a few
                    A few or all of them? Doesn't the wonderkid play on coop as well? Seems like being undefeated would be a good representation of the advantage of coop but perhaps in the end it just comes down to preference. Can't imagine not having a serious disadvantage defending though in a through ball meta so perhaps the ability to have better offensive dribbling is simply leveled out by conceding more goals.
                        Pretty much every pro plays tele broadcast/tele/default. A few play co op but especially this year with skill moves being the meta, almost no top pro does. And I presume you‚Äôre referring to Anders as the wonder kid, no he doesn‚Äôt use co op he uses tele broadcast.
                            This exactly
                            What settings on Tele Broadcast?
                                Often default.
                        Anders plays on tele broadcast looool way to undermine your own point
                what are you on about lmfao. Like 90% of any decent competitive players play tele broadcast. Last year a few played co op because of the slow nature of the game but still nowhere near as many as tele broadcast, tele or default. 

Also no clue where you‚Äôre getting about the live tourneys being on tele from because you‚Äôre literally able to put whatever settings you want on at the live tourneys lmao
                    You seem very riled up are you okay bud?
                        Nah was just baffled at you blatantly lying for no reason and passing it off as fact lmao
                            It's called a misunderstanding mate no need to get your panties in a twist. Just relax my boy.
            I can't dribble at in Co-op, but it's such a great camera mode. Never going back.
        I have a theory that it‚Äôs not as effective as you might think. It makes you to play too wide and push the full backs too far forward. Fun strategy but it can pull your team out of position if you really want to win. Works well if you like having your full backs push forward
            Yeah I play 5212 if I played narrow I wouldn‚Äôt bother, it‚Äôs helping me build play and use my Cbs more tho which helps
        Ironically, playing with that camera angle but with a smaller monitor(you‚Äôd have to be quite close to it tho) is definitely better than what OP has setup
        Playing SB whilst having a tv show on mini player, I trained myself to play with just the radar. Lol.
        Yeah but it's a shame it's glitched and adds delay
        Idk about you but ever since I've played on Tele from FIFA 10, I always change it to Tele. I can't stand te default
        I went back and forth a few times

Unfortunately it doesnt allow precision dribbling 

It's more efficient but less fun
        Co op is 1 of the reasons fifa is so bad
        Those it exists on fifa 17?
        I don‚Äôt get how anyone shoots on anything other than tele.
    I lose every single game anyway
    Using the radar is also very helpful. Takes a bit of getting use to but I also find this helpful
    Why? Everyone assumes the guy sees all the screen all the time. But you can just look close at the fragments.
    Like me with any monitor :/
    :))) me tooo
    funny thing is that's not true. FIFA 16 and before... yeah. Now you realistically only need to long shoot, do a through ball or cross. You can easily get elite 1 in this camera, it will show you any player who isn't offside for a pass, I imagine you spend on FIFA and have Neymar anyways so its a win-win

                    Cheers geoff
                If you don't mind me asking, how much is this monitor? You have a great setup
                    Like 1.5k
                        2k + in Aus...
                            Yea it‚Äôs weird how money conversions work, right?

edit: My mistake, it‚Äôs actually 2k USD in Australia.
                                Bloody expensive for a monitor but.... seems worth it!

I've got an LG 34gl750 which i thought was a great monitor and set me back 800AUD... then I came here.... the gratuitousness of this thread is at times beautiful and other times creates the utmost envy at my decision to have children.
                                    Make sure you inform people the burden of having children. It's so underrated and people just jump to having children then treat them like they're taking a paycheck. It's not like that, anyone who starts to compare their children to what they COULD have had should not have had children.
                                    The 34gl750 is 1000 AUD here in Sweden. The G9 is 2500 AUD. I feel your pain about high price on electronics!

Although when you see US prices, you have to add in sales tax, which varies by state. Some have no sales tax, highest is 13.5%.
                        But won‚Äôt spend $100 for windows lmao
                            Windows keys are like $5 if you know where to look.
                    You can get some really nice big ultrawides for the $750-$1000 too. This is just the best of the best
                Can you see whole field in broadcast camera?
                Got my girlfriend the same one 2 days ago. One hell of a price tag but at least she's happy lmao

They'd sound better on their side (tweeters apart) or even upside down, so that the sound from the tweeter can reach the ear directly..
    All the money spent on the monitors there isn't any left over for the windows key.

    You are the reason I no longer send as many snapchats. People would comment on tiny details and I just wonder who takes the time to analyze photos so closely.
        it took me a second to see the watermark on the bottom right when i put the picture on fullscreen. if you're above the age of 14 you shouldn't use snapchat anyways, so well done.
            Lmaooo I figured someone had to catch it but doesn't take away the fact that some people would notice everything in my photos hahaha
    Priorities
I feel like I would be worse on this than with my normal screen
    Lol how come?
        I feel like seeing that much of the pitch would get overwhelming. Could also be pretty broken tho
            Yeah maybe haha. I haven‚Äôt personally experienced that though. The monitor is a lot bigger than it looks in the photo and it‚Äôs very curved so it feels super immersive.
                How do the menus look on this monstrosity?
                    On mine, they are broken. Sort of. They work fine sometimes but its the presentation of them more than anything. Can still navigate through them.
                    Menus look great! Everything is the same size just more blue toward the outer edges.
                        What happens when you get up in the box? Does the camera move so your middle screen is on the ball and the other half shows the crowd or does it not move at all? Like for your own goal kicks can you only see as far as the half way line?
            Same reason I played 4:3 in counter strike
    Happy cake day!
    same but I reckon you'd adapt after a few games

    Go take a look at the guys who do sim racing and you‚Äôll see monitors like this everywhere (along with a bunch of other cool sim rigs)
Are you winning most games?
    More than I‚Äôm losing since I got this monitor lol. It‚Äôs really helpful for long through balls.
        Oh my god I can only imagine
        You can see the player's position in the minimap below, so the only advantage I see with such wide angle of view of the field is that you can see WHICH player is WHERE.
This looks incredible. How much did it cost you?
    A bit over $1500
        Let me hold a dollar
        Damn bro that‚Äôs more expensive than my whole pc....
            They don‚Äôt all cost that much, I have same size and it cost around $800
                Shit man, still more expensive than my pc....
                Yeah same size but probably not the same thing

Hey everybody, glad you like the setup :) I‚Äôll post a video of what the gameplay is like a little later today for those who are curious. Upvote this comment so it gets some more visibility and I‚Äôll link the post in the replies.

Cheers and have a great day!
    Looks great dude! I can‚Äôt wait for that video. Can you tell me how many inches is it exactly? I was thinking about buying a 29‚Äú one
        This one is 49‚Äù
            Damn and it costs only 1500?

If you could bear the motion sickness why not. I tried this sometime ago and let‚Äôs just say I ended up with a clean stomach.
    I don‚Äôt get any motion sickness actually. 240hz refresh rate and a 2080ti make the gameplay incredibly smooth.
I‚Äôm curious what happens when you‚Äôre attacking or defending does the play happen in the centre of the screen showing loads of the stadium on one side or are there pitch limits on how far the camera moves? So that the action is happening on the side of the screen? 

I‚Äôd personally prefer the latter as then you can still see what‚Äôs happening on most of the pitch.
Why do you have the radar on üòÖ
Poor Klipsch Speakers being hidden behind a freakin Samsung Monitor.
    Hahaha I know, it‚Äôs a shame. I would get a bigger desk but my apartment is too small :(
So huw much does the camera move? Only a slight bit, or is the ball still centered always? Because if it isn't, couldnt it be annoyingthat if the ball is on the left, that cant really see the time, playersname and such?
 **But can he do it on a cold rainy night in Stoke** ?

Love the Xbox 360 controller!

No but ‚ÄúAre you winning son?‚Äù
If you got used to this, I would imagine it‚Äôs a huge advantage. No need for the radar when you can see the entire pitch.
It's kinda cheating when Spurs play the Spanish national team.

    Lol don‚Äôt worry my Steam library is getting a lot of love right now ;)
    I disagree. Even if you ignore the extra screen real estate, 240hz makes the game so much smoother. I cringe every time I go back to the 30hz menus or replays on my friend‚Äôs xbox.

How?
I also have an ultrawide monitor but PC market and hackers are the reasons keeping me playing in ps4 ... So frustrating I cannot play my most favorite game using my favorite monitor.
    Plug in ps4 to monitor?
        ps4 only supports 16:9 while ultrawide is 21:9 or 32:9. I can still plug ps4 to my ultrawide but it never utilizes the entire screen but leaves 2 black bars.
Lmao a 360 controller
Man, how? What are it's settings?
    Default settings, just set the resolution to my monitor‚Äôs native 5120x1440.
Hey man, looks good. Have the same monitor, but I only have FIFA on PS4 and can‚Äôt select the full monitor resolution, it‚Äôs cropped. Any idea if it is possible? Or it is a console limitation?
Insane.. Where did you buy it?
    It's the Samsung odyssey g9, you can find it on Amazon, as an example. If you're interested in it, look trough various sites as the price difference can be huge. I bought my girlfriend this monitor some days ago for 1500‚Ç¨, Amazon has it for 1700‚Ç¨~. There is a cheaper version that has only 144hz, but this particular one has 240hz

Edit: lol who is mad and downvoting me
Is this disorienting at all? I feel like it would either be very immersive or not at all
    Not in the slightest. It‚Äôs incredibly immersive.
Do you actually feel comfortable playing at that angle? That would be so difficult for me üòÇ
That‚Äôs really cool what camera angle is it
    Default
        How come it doesn‚Äôt try and stretch a small portion of the pitch to fit the whole monitor
            Because it's a 32:9 aspect ratio, there's no way to stretch the standard 16:9 to that without it looking distorted. You just get more content to fill the screen. Think of it like a standard monitor only shows a cropped version of what you see here.
Is it possible to do something similar to this with a large TV monitor for console players?
    I don't believe so. What makes this possible is the 32:9 aspect ratio. Most TVs are 16:9. A couple of people in the comments have mentioned getting a similar effect with the co-op camera angle though. Maybe try that?
        Would it work of you used this monitor with a console?
Fair play üëèüèª
It's not cheating, but it's pretty cool.
Yes
Awesome ü§òüèΩ
How is the Odyssey G9 for other games? That resolution must be hard as fuck to drive. I have the G7 and it's been a wonder, future proof as fuck with the res and refresh rate. 

Only thing I could maybe complain about is the slight distortion due to the curve when on the desktop but other than that it's perfect.
    It‚Äôs pretty fantastic as long as the game supports the resolution. I‚Äôve tried COD, Cyberpunk, CIV 6, and some others and they all look great! I have a 2080ti and frame rates have been great on max settings.
Yeah I need this
There's no way to do this on anything other than PC FIFA, right?
    I‚Äôm not sure. You could try hooking up a console to the monitor but idk if the resolution would be supported.
        Would be black bars on the sides.
Are you more succesfull with this Setup?
Were you home or away here?
    Away
        Oh you‚Äôre playing at turf moor that‚Äôs my home stadium and I love that place. I feel like whenever I change my stadium from turf moor I suck haha

WHAT THE FU......
I'm beyond jealous right now.
With this monitor, i can spam 60 yard long when GK is out of position
This would be perfect for pro clubs, being able to have full vision at both ends
Ive got the exact same, had to use my old monitor back at my parents over Christmas, lost so many games, had to be the monitor üòÖ
Yo wtf
I'd say its probably classed as cheating lmao
I need a set up like this üòÇ
Nice Nym√∂
Maybe
It pains me to look at the scoreboard
I think it might be
this looks beautiful imagine being able to watch live games like this!
Play depth 3 and do tactics attacking long ball
No but how do I do. Or is it only for that kind of monitor
So this is why I lose every game I play
anders 360-0 gameplay secret... encrypted. üòÅ
If you love dribbling and skills to go past players use a zoomed in camera but if you‚Äôre a tactical manager who loves passing and taking advantage of runs then use co op or just custom and zoom out to the max.
This was one of the first posts this year that I was amazed about. Wow!
Is gaming overrall better on a monitor or tv??? I am seeing more people hooking up consoles to a monitor (i know this is pc) so is there a reason? Currently using a 4k 49" tv which im thinking of changing or moving my console set up.
    Monitors tend to have better reaction time (1 ms). Delay is the most frustrating thing in a game besides (speedup)lag
Imagine real life football on this monitor when you can see the whole pitch!
The amount of times, I lost the ball due to not being able to see the opponents player. And you also will never be surprised by troughballs to a player you didn‚Äôt know was there.
Nah the opponent‚Äôs Varane, Mendy and Gomez compensate for your screen...
    Don‚Äôt worry chief, I‚Äôve got Varane, Mendy, VVD, and Walker ;)
When you get asked how Xavi saw the pitch
thats a big monitor
It's not really full pitch, left right corner is unavailable lol
No. It is simply awesome! :P
Holy shit
Those filthy through balls
that is just fucking awesome!

You better have a great passing and possession stat
wtf
makes me actually want to play a fifa game and keep playing it, the close up perspective pissed me off. i am not too into football in real life but playing a game is always fun specially when you are generally a good gamer and easy smash above average players who take loosing hard ü§£ü§£ü§£
Indirect Pay to Win
is this achievable on a regular big screen by changing the aspect ratio to have a 3 : 1 (width : height)  


NVM  : i read a bit after this post and found consoles cant do anything more than 16 : 9 on any screen. that is sad. Its just that on Coop 20,0 sometimes shows me a lot of field , but on the irrelevant side. when my full backs have the ball in my third, i can see the spectators behind my goal but not where my strikers are (unless i use the map).
I have the exact same monitor and setup.. cheers.
It doesn't look efficient
I don't play fifa, heck I got this from the "trending on [sub]" but this is op
I'm guessing this is on PC?

Looks amazing btw.
here appeared the first version of fifa 21 with crack http://chinnica.net/-89882UAJM/3InP?rndad=3155823639-1610032702
If you‚Äôre constantly in full pitch view then what is the radar even for??
What keyboard is that?
That is awesome
Man, if I have one of this to play lol, I'll never lose a game.
How do you set this up in game? Or is it automatically do it given your monitor
Got an odyssey G9 myself back on black friday, loving it! Nice setup. Guess I missed out on a lot of free karma haha
What‚Äôs the name of this monitor?
That looks like it cost more than my rent
Bruh
Isnt expensive things give advantage the main mechanic of this game?
That's sick as hell
Been using an Ultrawide for a year and it is definitely better. You can see the runs wingers make and block them off far far easier. You can better predict the flow of the game and where the 2nd, 3rd and 4th pass is going to be.

I think it is a lack of support for these monitors for broadcast which stops streamers showcasing them and really encouraging players with a budget to partake.
Activate windows bro
This looks good enough for me to use normally for everything and get rid of my dual monitors lol
Nah this is just the ultimate p2p
HOLY DAMN that looks sick
I love you bro
I quite like the pro camera angle sometimes, being able to see the stands from the players view point(kinda)  feels a bit like you‚Äôre in the stadium
What are you drinking bro?
    It‚Äôs watermelon juice. Cheers, mate üçâ.
As a co op cam guy i am jealous
I cant see touchline on my right wing, weird
Woah
Ohhh so THIS is what it feels like to be Xavi
is there a way to partition like half it or anything ?
Neymar is the real cheating
 Nah, it‚Äôs intuitive... but you are gonna have a huge advantage now
I always complain about people in div rivals randomly crossing to a player in the middle of nowhere. Now I know why
I tried co op and found that I Can defend through balls allot better. Probably not the best idea to play with this camera angle when your tired as you‚Äôll have to squint.
Klipsch R-51PM speakers, you play listening through them??
Care to give us the link to buy this monitor or which one is it?
How the
Facebook is always a few days behind.

Damn.....What are the monitor dimensions and camera settings? Looks like 0 zoom
whoa
POV: You have never seen a woman
Dunno am sure they fixed it in 21
Yeah this is cheating,
Meh, not a fan of the view.
Has anyone gotten this with XBOX one? I have the same monitor and can‚Äôt get it past the normal view on Co-op at the same setting as OP mentioned!
Cheers love drink when I FIFA
My monitor üòç
U guys are losers lol

        I used to be one of those guys. Now I just want people to know not to waist there time playing this shit game
        Just being honest
Wow

Pay 2 Win
Nice screen
I need this set up! So sweet bro! Very nice.
What size is that?
Time to get a new controller bro
Holy moly
Fucking awesome
No
Mate, try co op camera angle. It‚Äôs pretty zoomed out but you can see both touch lines. It‚Äôs like playing the game on easy mode, fullbacks bombing forward constantly unamarked. Complete games changer. Defending is bit harder tho
    Yep. Read a comment during Fifa 19 about Co-op. Gave it a go and never looked back. So refreshing and the game feels much less claustrophobic.
        I‚Äôve played on co-op with zoom min and height max since I started ever playing pro clubs, such an advantage
        what settings (zoom & height) do you use on this camera?
            I use co-op with 0 zoom and 20 height, definitely the best settings for it imo
                I just switched to this setting from default last night and the game is legitimately more fun to play
                Yes! I thought I was the only one.
                Problem with co_op is it don't work with two players just ai
                    Why doesn't it work with 2 players?
                    It works with two players, it just means you don't have the same advantage because the other person can see a majority of the pitch too
                    yeah i'd rather not with multi.
            I‚Äôll have to double check but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just default. Don‚Äôt remember messing with it when I changed to co-op.
            Im pretty sure i use hieght 10  and zoom 12
        Agreed. Also being able to see the touch lines is awesome for switching the ball. It makes any kind of agile dribbling tougher and I have to sit a bit closer to my tv. But it is a great camera. The less claustrophobic point is a good one.
    I‚Äôd recommend anyone who is learning how to defend  to use the co-op camera as it will teach you to cover dangerous passes and through balls. It also teaches you to right stick switch properly as 1. You‚Äôll see a dangerous through ball early that you‚Äôll have to manually switch constantly to cover it and 2. As you are zoomed out I feel there is more margin for error with the right stick as your players are more spread apart on the screen.

Once you get the hang of defending, I suggest Tele Broadcast solely for dribbling, skill moves and to judge tackles more accurately.
        I‚Äôm finding dribbling in the box so much easier on co op, think it just feels like I have so much more passing options so I slow  my Play down. Just tackling aggressively  which Is hard
    Can‚Äôt dribble the same way on co op as you can on tele broadcast. There‚Äôs a reason the best in the world (tekkz, anders) play on tele broadcast.
        but you arent the best jn the world
            But if I‚Äôm an e1 player then I‚Äôm going to play better in the camera angle where I can more accurately dribble and get the angles that I need. Don‚Äôt get me wrong co op definitely makes defending and seeing some passing angles much easier. But if you feel like your good at defending I think tele broadcast is better
                I agree with you, although I'm not as good as you, I used co-op for a while, and whilst seeing the extra pitch was immensely helpful, dribbling was harder and just in the end was counter productive
                Still ... get gud. U ain‚Äôt gnna be elite ever. Perhaps focus on school
                    It‚Äôs winter break bro last thing I wanna think about is accounting
                        bro schools are starting agian
                            Don‚Äôt start till the 25th - hopefully enough time to will myself to do the SB icon swaps
                                The goalkeeper trick works well.
            I‚Äôm in division 1 on seasons, AMA
        read this the other day and after years of co-op decided to give it a go. Unreal, best dribbling I‚Äôve ever done, undefeated since switching. I still make a few bad passes to players off screen but make up for it w/ far more accurate dribbling/passing/defending
        [deleted]
            Absolutely not true. Alekzandur, hektic Jukez, joksan, maxe vip, ajax Joey and Crackheber all play on tele broadcast. 6 out of the top na pros just to name a few
                A few or all of them? Doesn't the wonderkid play on coop as well? Seems like being undefeated would be a good representation of the advantage of coop but perhaps in the end it just comes down to preference. Can't imagine not having a serious disadvantage defending though in a through ball meta so perhaps the ability to have better offensive dribbling is simply leveled out by conceding more goals.
                    Pretty much every pro plays tele broadcast/tele/default. A few play co op but especially this year with skill moves being the meta, almost no top pro does. And I presume you‚Äôre referring to Anders as the wonder kid, no he doesn‚Äôt use co op he uses tele broadcast.
                        This exactly
                        What settings on Tele Broadcast?
                            Often default.
                    Anders plays on tele broadcast looool way to undermine your own point
            what are you on about lmfao. Like 90% of any decent competitive players play tele broadcast. Last year a few played co op because of the slow nature of the game but still nowhere near as many as tele broadcast, tele or default. 

Also no clue where you‚Äôre getting about the live tourneys being on tele from because you‚Äôre literally able to put whatever settings you want on at the live tourneys lmao
                You seem very riled up are you okay bud?
                    Nah was just baffled at you blatantly lying for no reason and passing it off as fact lmao
                        It's called a misunderstanding mate no need to get your panties in a twist. Just relax my boy.
        I can't dribble at in Co-op, but it's such a great camera mode. Never going back.
    I have a theory that it‚Äôs not as effective as you might think. It makes you to play too wide and push the full backs too far forward. Fun strategy but it can pull your team out of position if you really want to win. Works well if you like having your full backs push forward
        Yeah I play 5212 if I played narrow I wouldn‚Äôt bother, it‚Äôs helping me build play and use my Cbs more tho which helps
    Ironically, playing with that camera angle but with a smaller monitor(you‚Äôd have to be quite close to it tho) is definitely better than what OP has setup
    Playing SB whilst having a tv show on mini player, I trained myself to play with just the radar. Lol.
    Yeah but it's a shame it's glitched and adds delay
    Idk about you but ever since I've played on Tele from FIFA 10, I always change it to Tele. I can't stand te default
    I went back and forth a few times

Unfortunately it doesnt allow precision dribbling 

It's more efficient but less fun
    Co op is 1 of the reasons fifa is so bad
    Those it exists on fifa 17?
    I don‚Äôt get how anyone shoots on anything other than tele.
I lose every single game anyway
Using the radar is also very helpful. Takes a bit of getting use to but I also find this helpful
Why? Everyone assumes the guy sees all the screen all the time. But you can just look close at the fragments.
Like me with any monitor :/
:))) me tooo
funny thing is that's not true. FIFA 16 and before... yeah. Now you realistically only need to long shoot, do a through ball or cross. You can easily get elite 1 in this camera, it will show you any player who isn't offside for a pass, I imagine you spend on FIFA and have Neymar anyways so its a win-win
You caught me lmao

            This post was sponsored by Samsung
                Hahaha
            Cheers mate
                Cheers geoff
            If you don't mind me asking, how much is this monitor? You have a great setup
                Like 1.5k
                    2k + in Aus...
                        Yea it‚Äôs weird how money conversions work, right?

edit: My mistake, it‚Äôs actually 2k USD in Australia.
                            Bloody expensive for a monitor but.... seems worth it!

I've got an LG 34gl750 which i thought was a great monitor and set me back 800AUD... then I came here.... the gratuitousness of this thread is at times beautiful and other times creates the utmost envy at my decision to have children.
                                Make sure you inform people the burden of having children. It's so underrated and people just jump to having children then treat them like they're taking a paycheck. It's not like that, anyone who starts to compare their children to what they COULD have had should not have had children.
                                The 34gl750 is 1000 AUD here in Sweden. The G9 is 2500 AUD. I feel your pain about high price on electronics!

Although when you see US prices, you have to add in sales tax, which varies by state. Some have no sales tax, highest is 13.5%.
                    But won‚Äôt spend $100 for windows lmao
                        Windows keys are like $5 if you know where to look.
                You can get some really nice big ultrawides for the $750-$1000 too. This is just the best of the best
            Can you see whole field in broadcast camera?

All the money spent on the monitors there isn't any left over for the windows key.
Its like a $3 Russian key from ebay too.
You are the reason I no longer send as many snapchats. People would comment on tiny details and I just wonder who takes the time to analyze photos so closely.
    it took me a second to see the watermark on the bottom right when i put the picture on fullscreen. if you're above the age of 14 you shouldn't use snapchat anyways, so well done.
        Lmaooo I figured someone had to catch it but doesn't take away the fact that some people would notice everything in my photos hahaha
Priorities
Lol how come?
    I feel like seeing that much of the pitch would get overwhelming. Could also be pretty broken tho
        Yeah maybe haha. I haven‚Äôt personally experienced that though. The monitor is a lot bigger than it looks in the photo and it‚Äôs very curved so it feels super immersive.
            How do the menus look on this monstrosity?
                On mine, they are broken. Sort of. They work fine sometimes but its the presentation of them more than anything. Can still navigate through them.
                Menus look great! Everything is the same size just more blue toward the outer edges.
                    What happens when you get up in the box? Does the camera move so your middle screen is on the ball and the other half shows the crowd or does it not move at all? Like for your own goal kicks can you only see as far as the half way line?
        Same reason I played 4:3 in counter strike
Happy cake day!
same but I reckon you'd adapt after a few games

    Oh my god I can only imagine
    You can see the player's position in the minimap below, so the only advantage I see with such wide angle of view of the field is that you can see WHICH player is WHERE.
A bit over $1500

        They don‚Äôt all cost that much, I have same size and it cost around $800

I disagree. Even if you ignore the extra screen real estate, 240hz makes the game so much smoother. I cringe every time I go back to the 30hz menus or replays on my friend‚Äôs xbox.

Plug in ps4 to monitor?
    ps4 only supports 16:9 while ultrawide is 21:9 or 32:9. I can still plug ps4 to my ultrawide but it never utilizes the entire screen but leaves 2 black bars.
Default settings, just set the resolution to my monitor‚Äôs native 5120x1440.
It's the Samsung odyssey g9, you can find it on Amazon, as an example. If you're interested in it, look trough various sites as the price difference can be huge. I bought my girlfriend this monitor some days ago for 1500‚Ç¨, Amazon has it for 1700‚Ç¨~. There is a cheaper version that has only 144hz, but this particular one has 240hz
It‚Äôs watermelon juice lmao
Not in the slightest. It‚Äôs incredibly immersive.
Default
    How come it doesn‚Äôt try and stretch a small portion of the pitch to fit the whole monitor
        Because it's a 32:9 aspect ratio, there's no way to stretch the standard 16:9 to that without it looking distorted. You just get more content to fill the screen. Think of it like a standard monitor only shows a cropped version of what you see here.
I don't believe so. What makes this possible is the 32:9 aspect ratio. Most TVs are 16:9. A couple of people in the comments have mentioned getting a similar effect with the co-op camera angle though. Maybe try that?
    Would it work of you used this monitor with a console?
It‚Äôs pretty fantastic as long as the game supports the resolution. I‚Äôve tried COD, Cyberpunk, CIV 6, and some others and they all look great! I have a 2080ti and frame rates have been great on max settings.
I‚Äôm not sure. You could try hooking up a console to the monitor but idk if the resolution would be supported.
    Would be black bars on the sides.
Away
    Oh you‚Äôre playing at turf moor that‚Äôs my home stadium and I love that place. I feel like whenever I change my stadium from turf moor I suck haha

                Anders plays on tele broadcast looool way to undermine your own point
        what are you on about lmfao. Like 90% of any decent competitive players play tele broadcast. Last year a few played co op because of the slow nature of the game but still nowhere near as many as tele broadcast, tele or default. 

Also no clue where you‚Äôre getting about the live tourneys being on tele from because you‚Äôre literally able to put whatever settings you want on at the live tourneys lmao
            You seem very riled up are you okay bud?
                Nah was just baffled at you blatantly lying for no reason and passing it off as fact lmao
                    It's called a misunderstanding mate no need to get your panties in a twist. Just relax my boy.
    I can't dribble at in Co-op, but it's such a great camera mode. Never going back.
I have a theory that it‚Äôs not as effective as you might think. It makes you to play too wide and push the full backs too far forward. Fun strategy but it can pull your team out of position if you really want to win. Works well if you like having your full backs push forward
    Yeah I play 5212 if I played narrow I wouldn‚Äôt bother, it‚Äôs helping me build play and use my Cbs more tho which helps
Ironically, playing with that camera angle but with a smaller monitor(you‚Äôd have to be quite close to it tho) is definitely better than what OP has setup
Playing SB whilst having a tv show on mini player, I trained myself to play with just the radar. Lol.
Yeah but it's a shame it's glitched and adds delay
Idk about you but ever since I've played on Tele from FIFA 10, I always change it to Tele. I can't stand te default
I went back and forth a few times

Unfortunately it doesnt allow precision dribbling 

It's more efficient but less fun
Co op is 1 of the reasons fifa is so bad
Those it exists on fifa 17?
I don‚Äôt get how anyone shoots on anything other than tele.
KSI is that you?

What kind of monitor is this?
    This is the Samsung Odyssey G9. It‚Äôs 49‚Äù, 5120x1440 resolution, 240hz refresh rate, full HDR, 1000r curve.

        If you don't mind me asking, how much is this monitor? You have a great setup
            Like 1.5k
                2k + in Aus...
                    Yea it‚Äôs weird how money conversions work, right?

edit: My mistake, it‚Äôs actually 2k USD in Australia.
                        Bloody expensive for a monitor but.... seems worth it!

I've got an LG 34gl750 which i thought was a great monitor and set me back 800AUD... then I came here.... the gratuitousness of this thread is at times beautiful and other times creates the utmost envy at my decision to have children.
                            Make sure you inform people the burden of having children. It's so underrated and people just jump to having children then treat them like they're taking a paycheck. It's not like that, anyone who starts to compare their children to what they COULD have had should not have had children.
                            The 34gl750 is 1000 AUD here in Sweden. The G9 is 2500 AUD. I feel your pain about high price on electronics!

Although when you see US prices, you have to add in sales tax, which varies by state. Some have no sales tax, highest is 13.5%.
                But won‚Äôt spend $100 for windows lmao
                    Windows keys are like $5 if you know where to look.
            You can get some really nice big ultrawides for the $750-$1000 too. This is just the best of the best
        Can you see whole field in broadcast camera?
        Got my girlfriend the same one 2 days ago. One hell of a price tag but at least she's happy lmao

PM‚Äôd something to help with this
it took me a second to see the watermark on the bottom right when i put the picture on fullscreen. if you're above the age of 14 you shouldn't use snapchat anyways, so well done.
    Lmaooo I figured someone had to catch it but doesn't take away the fact that some people would notice everything in my photos hahaha
I feel like seeing that much of the pitch would get overwhelming. Could also be pretty broken tho
    Yeah maybe haha. I haven‚Äôt personally experienced that though. The monitor is a lot bigger than it looks in the photo and it‚Äôs very curved so it feels super immersive.
        How do the menus look on this monstrosity?
            On mine, they are broken. Sort of. They work fine sometimes but its the presentation of them more than anything. Can still navigate through them.
            Menus look great! Everything is the same size just more blue toward the outer edges.
                What happens when you get up in the box? Does the camera move so your middle screen is on the ball and the other half shows the crowd or does it not move at all? Like for your own goal kicks can you only see as far as the half way line?
    Same reason I played 4:3 in counter strike

Oh my god I can only imagine
You can see the player's position in the minimap below, so the only advantage I see with such wide angle of view of the field is that you can see WHICH player is WHERE.
Let me hold a dollar
Damn bro that‚Äôs more expensive than my whole pc....
    They don‚Äôt all cost that much, I have same size and it cost around $800
        Shit man, still more expensive than my pc....
        Yeah same size but probably not the same thing
Why did you make the decision to buy this?
    I want. I buy.
    Oh I got it now. You have MONEYY
Hey little dude from across the street. Let me hold a dollar.
This one is 49‚Äù
    Damn and it costs only 1500?
they... they don't work like that
    shhh just let them hand me them
Did nobody sense my sarcasm lol
    You know sarcasm comes from tone of voice? Not something you can get across on the internet
        That‚Äôs exactly why I did, ‚ÄúüôÑ‚Äù lmfao some people man
I literally couldn‚Äôt of made it more obvious I was being sarcastic
    It doesnt matter on Reddit, sarcasm doesn't exist unless you use /s. Don't ask me why, I hate it too.
ps4 only supports 16:9 while ultrawide is 21:9 or 32:9. I can still plug ps4 to my ultrawide but it never utilizes the entire screen but leaves 2 black bars.
How come it doesn‚Äôt try and stretch a small portion of the pitch to fit the whole monitor
    Because it's a 32:9 aspect ratio, there's no way to stretch the standard 16:9 to that without it looking distorted. You just get more content to fill the screen. Think of it like a standard monitor only shows a cropped version of what you see here.
Would it work of you used this monitor with a console?
Would be black bars on the sides.
Oh you‚Äôre playing at turf moor that‚Äôs my home stadium and I love that place. I feel like whenever I change my stadium from turf moor I suck haha
    Oh nice! I play at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium :)
I used to be one of those guys. Now I just want people to know not to waist there time playing this shit game
Just being honest
I‚Äôve played on co-op with zoom min and height max since I started ever playing pro clubs, such an advantage
what settings (zoom & height) do you use on this camera?
    I use co-op with 0 zoom and 20 height, definitely the best settings for it imo
        I just switched to this setting from default last night and the game is legitimately more fun to play
        Yes! I thought I was the only one.
        Problem with co_op is it don't work with two players just ai
            Why doesn't it work with 2 players?
            It works with two players, it just means you don't have the same advantage because the other person can see a majority of the pitch too
            yeah i'd rather not with multi.
    I‚Äôll have to double check but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just default. Don‚Äôt remember messing with it when I changed to co-op.
    Im pretty sure i use hieght 10  and zoom 12
Agreed. Also being able to see the touch lines is awesome for switching the ball. It makes any kind of agile dribbling tougher and I have to sit a bit closer to my tv. But it is a great camera. The less claustrophobic point is a good one.
I‚Äôm finding dribbling in the box so much easier on co op, think it just feels like I have so much more passing options so I slow  my Play down. Just tackling aggressively  which Is hard
but you arent the best jn the world
    But if I‚Äôm an e1 player then I‚Äôm going to play better in the camera angle where I can more accurately dribble and get the angles that I need. Don‚Äôt get me wrong co op definitely makes defending and seeing some passing angles much easier. But if you feel like your good at defending I think tele broadcast is better
        I agree with you, although I'm not as good as you, I used co-op for a while, and whilst seeing the extra pitch was immensely helpful, dribbling was harder and just in the end was counter productive
        Still ... get gud. U ain‚Äôt gnna be elite ever. Perhaps focus on school
            It‚Äôs winter break bro last thing I wanna think about is accounting
                bro schools are starting agian
                    Don‚Äôt start till the 25th - hopefully enough time to will myself to do the SB icon swaps
                        The goalkeeper trick works well.
    I‚Äôm in division 1 on seasons, AMA
read this the other day and after years of co-op decided to give it a go. Unreal, best dribbling I‚Äôve ever done, undefeated since switching. I still make a few bad passes to players off screen but make up for it w/ far more accurate dribbling/passing/defending
[deleted]
    Absolutely not true. Alekzandur, hektic Jukez, joksan, maxe vip, ajax Joey and Crackheber all play on tele broadcast. 6 out of the top na pros just to name a few
        A few or all of them? Doesn't the wonderkid play on coop as well? Seems like being undefeated would be a good representation of the advantage of coop but perhaps in the end it just comes down to preference. Can't imagine not having a serious disadvantage defending though in a through ball meta so perhaps the ability to have better offensive dribbling is simply leveled out by conceding more goals.
            Pretty much every pro plays tele broadcast/tele/default. A few play co op but especially this year with skill moves being the meta, almost no top pro does. And I presume you‚Äôre referring to Anders as the wonder kid, no he doesn‚Äôt use co op he uses tele broadcast.

Why doesn't it work with 2 players?
It works with two players, it just means you don't have the same advantage because the other person can see a majority of the pitch too
yeah i'd rather not with multi.
It‚Äôs winter break bro last thing I wanna think about is accounting
    bro schools are starting agian
        Don‚Äôt start till the 25th - hopefully enough time to will myself to do the SB icon swaps
            The goalkeeper trick works well.
Pretty much every pro plays tele broadcast/tele/default. A few play co op but especially this year with skill moves being the meta, almost no top pro does. And I presume you‚Äôre referring to Anders as the wonder kid, no he doesn‚Äôt use co op he uses tele broadcast.
    This exactly
    What settings on Tele Broadcast?
        Often default.
Anders plays on tele broadcast looool way to undermine your own point
Nah was just baffled at you blatantly lying for no reason and passing it off as fact lmao
    It's called a misunderstanding mate no need to get your panties in a twist. Just relax my boy.
You guys are such pricks....

2k + in Aus...
    Yea it‚Äôs weird how money conversions work, right?

edit: My mistake, it‚Äôs actually 2k USD in Australia.
        Bloody expensive for a monitor but.... seems worth it!

I've got an LG 34gl750 which i thought was a great monitor and set me back 800AUD... then I came here.... the gratuitousness of this thread is at times beautiful and other times creates the utmost envy at my decision to have children.
            Make sure you inform people the burden of having children. It's so underrated and people just jump to having children then treat them like they're taking a paycheck. It's not like that, anyone who starts to compare their children to what they COULD have had should not have had children.
            The 34gl750 is 1000 AUD here in Sweden. The G9 is 2500 AUD. I feel your pain about high price on electronics!

Although when you see US prices, you have to add in sales tax, which varies by state. Some have no sales tax, highest is 13.5%.
But won‚Äôt spend $100 for windows lmao
    Windows keys are like $5 if you know where to look.
