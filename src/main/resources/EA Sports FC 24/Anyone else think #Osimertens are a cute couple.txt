When you show the girls the wedding ring.
    Haha
I hope we get a ton of Napoli players all with dynamic images doing this celebration
    And this will be their default in game celebration
When you both got ur nails done
say what you want about EA but these card designs are insane
    These card designs are insigne*
        OT: Cant stand the asterisk behind the sentence
    Yeah, but I don't know about this one. I mean it's cool, but I'd rather have a scream team promo with halloween design and cards with two 99 stats changing every full moon. Rulebreakers make no sense to me.
this sub is so fast with the memes I swear
    faster than EA servers
        That‚Äôs a given surely

                        today, that guy took the time to browse my comments to see where I'm from and then translate, for example, "piece of shit" to portuguese just to insult me lol
                        Are you making out as if he said the n word? If so, then that's not what happened
                            What he say then? Obviously don't say the word but the N word is strongly inferred here?
                                He hasn't said the n word. He said piece of shit in Portuguese and everyone's calling him racist for some reason
                                    Why did he call him a POS and go out his way to find the transaltion for it? But it is tame in terms of insult even if it was petty
                    I feel like I'm missing something here?
Maybe I could give you a real answer if these fookin servers worked on Xbox
    Yeah I was looking to get a good chunk of the WL done last night. Hopefully can still get into the silvers
ü•∫
For real tho, props to EA for the amazing card designs. Although if they took the same effort as they did with card designs to improve the gameplay, we would be seeing a much better game
Yes
wholesome
Nawh üíï
HAHAHAHA
Best friends forever
They look so happy lol
i feel like they should be looking at a cute little kitty right between them or something
The look my pro clubs team makes after owning the team that shushed us after their first goal.
    Well.  Shushing isn‚Äôt a thing anymore so..
        Thankfully...
Best fwends
Oh shit I didn't even realize my Osimhen had upgraded
Wtf im gay now
Looks like Mertens pulled it out and Osimhen likes it
Dont give me flashbacks to osimobile

They were so beutiful
ffs, sold Osimhen last week. want this
Man, ive been enjoying FIFA 21 so much that I forgot about the destroyer of worlds and happiness, osimhen
Off-Topic: Mertens seems like a fun dude to hangout out with.

I can see the Belgium dressing room being a lively one with him, Hazard, Bats and Lukaku being a blast and having fun while Kevin just sits in the corner quietly!
So cute. Love this
They actually did this celebration together
You stole this from chu boi‚Äôs Twitter.
Thats kinda sus
That is nice. However lazy since IIRC they used that Mertens picture last year for a card. Can‚Äôt be that hard to get a diff picture.
    Different picture, thats the new shirt mate
    It's this season's kit at least.
    You‚Äôre wrong fam. You‚Äôre thinking of flashback Mertens from last year and they used his tongue sticking celebration against Barca for that card. This is a different celebration.
    It‚Äôs just the same celebration, whole different season
    License issues and it‚Äôs probs cheaper just to use ones they have a license for
        It‚Äôs a new pic
    I bet you‚Äôre fun at parties
    I don‚Äôt think they did, did they?
        Dont know if they used a pic of him doing this celebration, but no matter what, it‚Äôs a different picture as he is wearing the new kit

Edit: they used a pic of him doing the same celebration, but it‚Äôs still a new picture
    That pic isn't on any of his cards last year. They did use the same picture for his gold card for 3 years though haha.
Camp as tits!
Why is Osimhen looking at down at Mertens's pp tho?
Well duh... they have good chemistry together...
That celebration really grew on me . At first I hated it than I found myself doin it throughout the week lol
yes
I have packed OTW Osimhen first day of tge fifa! Seems like a decent card, doesn't really fit my epl team but woyld be a good sub i think.
Gold mertens clear of this one btw
Fucking love them
Cutest duo ever
What about Lozano on the wing? RW or LW
Oh yeah we ship
Someone should make a dancing team!
We need Insigne to complete the trio üòÇ
Why Osimen looking at Mertens dick?
imagine being forced to switch them for the chemistry lul
With the two Red links they wouldnt have 10 CHEM. Don't know why i had the urge to say that :D
I hate it. Think it‚Äôs sus
And they have perfect chemistry. #Relationship goals
