Will turning my TV upside-down work?
    One time I did the windows + arrow trick to flip my boss's monitor upside. He told me that he had to physically flip his monitor over to look through his settings to figure out how to change it  back.
        I accidentally did that to the family PC as a kid. My mum had to call in some guy to fix it and he fixed it by using a system restore from before it happened. At the time, I was really upset to lose my Rayman 3 save file but looking back... Holy shit was that tech guy incompetent.
            Probably did it so he could charge a few hours of labor
        Yeah, my favourite prank at work back in the day
            Does that functionality still exist? Cause that'll definitely still work today.
                It does, on laptops that aren’t heavily configured by your company.
    no then the sound will be upside down
    it will auto rotate so that its always upside down
I downvoted, which is an Australian upvote.
Awful. God awful. Upvoted.

Quality shitpost.
Genuinely had me panicked for a second, gg
"Australian Greenwich Mean Time"?
    who in the hell says it like that?
    It's UTC+10:04:44 (using the Greenwich in Sydney)
If this isn’t top post for at least this week I’m going to be very disappointed. 10/10
Oh the ol' upside down stadium trick, eh?

Top post!

Does changing your time zone work on PS4 without changing the region?
Has anybody in the UK and Ireland had problems starting their game? I have it pre ordered xbox one?
So i changed to new New Zealand and it works! Need to restart xbox right after doing so
Lmfao dude I’m in the zone at least
Hahahahaahahaha
“I could beat you upside down”
But will the toilet water flush clockwise in my house?
Interesting that this is purely a Northern Hemisphere perspective on the world...

From space, there is no 'up' or 'down'... so in theory, Australia could actually be on 'top'... which is how we perceive the world anyway :)

So you Northern Hemisphere folk keep on dreaming the dream, while we Australians, New Zealanders and South Americans know the REAL story...
    It is a Joke
It is the Outback, but it looks like it's time for you to backout
Loooooooool
Bantz. 👍
Can confirm toilet water will spin the other way once this setting is changed also
Wait you guys don’t play like this?
What do you mean, nothing changed
& the commentators will say 
 "that play didn't go along the script".
That proves that Earth isn't flat!

Reddit has one joke about Australia and it stopped being funny about 20 seconds after the first time it was used.
    american: you're upside down   
australian: you're backwards
    The chat also gets pretty dire as a kiwi. "NZ? More like Middle Earth! Lord of the Rings hahahahaha."
        GOAT fuckin series, the best trilogy in history.
    You’re forgetting the ‘every animal is trying to kill you’ dead horse that’s been flogged a fuckin million times by the seppos too mate
        never fuckin mind that 98% of our critters arw fuckin harmless, the Europeans and south Americans i know also flog this horse roo, originality knows no borders.
    Nah there's also the "lost a war to birds that can't even fly". Not sure which one is worse.
Quality content!
Well that’s brightened up my evening!
Its ok to be white...
I live in Australia, what's the difference?
I don’t understand this meme? I’m in Australia? Is it the grass or something?
I come from a land down under...
As an Englishman living in Oz, I laughed.  On a side note, my god it was hard to be at work by 6am.  Especially with a few sick days stored up.
Literally down under...
DO YA COME FROM THE LAND DOWN UNDAH
Up the millers
Turn TV upside down, done
Is there an issue?
Holy fucking shit
😂😂
ok i got caught

have my upvote
Can’t believe this got a laugh out of me ffs
I love it
If I change to Australia can I play the game?
    Only on xbox
        How? It isn't working for me. Do I just change location and reset?
            As far as I know but I'm sure there's a YouTube video if you're struggling
I don't see the problem.
Take my upvote
This is the post that gets me to unsub from this sub.
This is dumb, because the T.V. would be upside down too making the screen right side up.

Lazy derivatives of the same joke.  How many more years will unintelligent people find this trope humorous?
What is Australian 'GMT'? 😂🥴
Just turn your TV upside down.  Problem solved

        It's one of those rare shows, that gets BETTER with each season.. It just hits all the ticks, for people of all age, and gets kind of addictive. I have never seen a show that is so easy to binge, and i have seen every show possible.  It's bonkers


This last season of SS was certainly the best, and the acting from some of these folks.. was even more exquisite.  The entire vibe about the show is always great.

Millie Bobby Brown is a bit too fantastic for her age, and her acting in Season 3 is even more phenomenal. Winona Ryder is a legend, David Harbour is just too fuckin good, and shoutout to my boy Dacre Montgomery. What an epic Season 3 performance as Billie.. He really stole the season.  Sheesh
