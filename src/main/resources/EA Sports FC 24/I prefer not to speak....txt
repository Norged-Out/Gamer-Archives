[[I prefer not to speak...]]





Nah this is the nuttiest thing I’ve ever seen
    The most Fifa-thing i’ve ever witnessed.
    And it’s NNN!
    I would also nut if this happened for me..
    People still claim there is no scripting and it’s all skill...
This game costs €60
    So you’re telling me that wasn’t De Gea’s highlights vs Everton???
    if this was a reoccuring feature I would pay 70€
    120 if you wanna play online...
        Not on pc 😁

                🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ join me on 21:9 widescreen...where i see both goals at once and play at 144hz at the same time at 2k... didnt xbox have a dc glitch? I play on pc...no cheaters as far as i can tell...the lag free menus the high refreshrate in game...so smooth 😁 console is upgrading to "next gen".On pc...you are always on next gen....
                    The menus are laggy on PC too...
                        Server lag versus low fps lag are totally different things...sadly we all suffer from bad servers
                        Thats not true at all.
                            I play on PC since Fifa 17. The menus are laggy on PC too.
                                Emm they are not? Force driver side vsync, that geta past 60 in game 😁 (cuz fifa is stupid)
                                    Playing with vsync online is impossible for me, too much delay. I'm pretty sure that even with that, we have frames drop in the menus... The game is not well coded.
                                Get a better pc.

                        i play fifa on pc for over a year now and didnt had any trouble finding matches and almost no cheaters, and the market is ok, but i still agree that it is better on console, but since i have a pc good enough to play it, i prefer than having to pay to play online
                            [deleted]
                                i agree with you, but most of the games i play are on the pc, and where i live ps plus/xbox live is more expensive than 25 dollars

                        We've recently hit 1,000,000 transfer listings, wdym by no market? The player base is as big as it's ever been, and cheaters are reeeally hard to find. I've been playing since FIFA 18 and I've come across 2, maybe 3 cheaters.
                        Hhaahhahaah 4k 120hz on a console

I mean I know it's a sports game but hahahahahha

                                Welcome to 2012 my friend...hope you like it and join the darkside 😂
                                    This is why people hate the PC community. You guys are all assholes. Fuck the PCMR people too.
                            4k 120hz? You play on that? 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ no you dont...so please stop being a fanboy....
                        120 Hz is the refresh rate dumbass, that's dependent on your monitor not on the game itself...stop tryna talk like you know stuff 😂
                    But the FUT pc market contains 10 people haha
                    Try and guess how many people actually care
                        I have a PC and PS4 but I don’t care which ones better and I definitely don’t care about your bragging, you can’t be older than 10 surely?
                            Its not braging...monitors are cheap nowdays...a 8 year old pc can run that...far from braging...point is...you can only do that on pc...
                ffs bro stop that stereotype. thinking every single game people cheat. Im not saying it doesnt happen but it happens on both sides (pc and consoles). on fifa(ps4) i had people constantly lag switching it was getting ridiculous
        Why is that?
            You need PS+, in order to play Fifa online, which is another €60/Year
                I mean yes if Fifa is the only game you play if you play other online games that cost comes down majorly even if it's only 4 other games
            gotta buy currency to buy packs
                I mean, you don't have to.
                    If you want to be competitive you do
                        Nah you don’t stfu
                            Someone’s a bit grumpy this morning
                                You really dont lol. Never spent any money on fifa points and always finish high in WL and have lots of money just from sbcs and trading to build a nice team
                                    > and trading to build a nice team

Making Fifa your second job you mean.

It's clearly Pay 2 Win. Mbappe scores when Jesus doesn't. Jesus scores when Lacazette doesn't.
                                    You’re obviously not an average player, mediocre players like myself need to spend money to barely compete with the mbappes neymar and rule breaker teams that are very op in a competent players hands
                                But you don’t, I do decent enough by not spending money, you literally don’t have to
                        I have a friend thats div 2, and he hasn't spent a single penny on the game this year.
                            Gold 1 and div 1 here. Never spent a single dime. After having watched people spending thousands of € only to pull Busquets I decided I’d rather my spend my money otherwise. I think this year it isn’t that much of a problem like it used to be. Came back to fifa after having not played since fifa 15.
    Why do you chumps keep falling for it.
        [removed]
            dude, imagine being losing 4-3 and you are about to 4-4 and then this happens. Its even fut champions. I dont break controllers or anything but i will def not play for at least a couple hours.
                Being a bit mad I can understand but if you don't laugh about this if not straight away then later then you are taking it too seriously
            I'm not, I don't even own the game, so I've no reason to be upset with something, I'm just pointing out that time and time again people are unhappy with FIFA but it won't change until you vote with your wallet.


I think this is a hilarious clip as well tbf.
        its a $60/year subscription for roster updates and some small minor tweaks. I play pro clubs with my friends theres never anyone online in old games..it is what it is
            It is what it is? Oof don't accept that, they should and can do better.
                yeah if i had the power to change it i would im as mad as everyone else but idk what else there is to do so...whats the use
                    At the end of the day of you don't care then that's fine, if you wanna play games with your mates and stuff then that's cool that's up to you and no one can tell you other wise.

But the way to show you don't accept it is to vote with your wallet.

Unfortunately FIFA have all but monopolised the football genre and we all suffer for it.
                        there is no winning

boring dystopia
    *laughs in EA Play*
    Final Fantasy 21
    This is by far the buggiest FIFA I’ve ever played, they’re not game breaking bugs but just visual glitches that happen every time I play.
        That looks pretty game breaking to me
            I meant the bugs that I’m seeing. I do get one very annoying one when making transfer offers though, if the first bid isn’t accepted then their counter offer is typically 3x the players value(sometimes more).
        This clip looks like it could've been recorded in 2015.. It doesn't look "next gen" at all.
    this was a funny bug, happens once per 10 years
So what? This happens all the time in real life football

And it should count as 2 goals
    This guy table tops.
    There's a popular rule for Table Football(Foosball) here in Brazil that GK goals count as 2. Maybe we should start applying it for real football too
        Im pretty sure that's the joke he was making
    name 10 matches for the many times?
        Yeah man, this is what we in the business like to call "a joke"
Enjoy my free award this made my day also EA *We WiLl NoT RelEAsE A DeMo To FoCuS Oon dEliVerInG The BeST FuLl GaMe LOL*
    I like to think all EA employees who work on FIFA have to work with a handicap by contract, writing code with one hand. And the contract states you can’t use your dominant one. 
It makes the game seem a bit more understandable.
    Has anyone else conceded a goal like this? No.

In a complex simulation things like this happen sometimes, but remember it happens like once in a million matches.
        While I haven't conceded a goal like this, the ball frequently bounces far and fast from a GK save, so it's a quite common issue and this was just on the more extreme end of the issue.

This scenario may happen once in a million matches but the issue is common.
        Something: happens only once to 1 person out of millions

People: wtf this game is so broken
        >Has anyone else conceded a goal like this? No.

There's been several different clips on the subreddit already this FIFA of this happening, then use your lack of brains to try to realise that the majority of FIFA players don't come anywhere near this reddit so, extrapolate.
    Everyone says this like it’s a bad thing. Remember though...  it could have been worse!
Of course it was in WL
Lmao thank you for this. I stopped at Gold 3 with 8 games left, but I was considering the idea of going for at least Gold 2. You convinced me to not touch the game, to avoid getting stressed
    I stopped at 6-2 this weekend. Fifa 21 now is same as fifa 20 and again strongly felt that it’s not good for my mental health. Removed the game. Always autoblocks, sometimes the game works only for my opponent. That’s enough man. Will never touch this game again
        I stopped at 2-4. You might laugh, but I was winning two games without lag when the server randomly disconnected. No need to damage my mental health over a stupid video game
        See you next week.
        I really only do squad battles and the building challenges because anytime I start to play actual people my blood pressure raises way too high
        "sometimes the game works only for my opponent"- that is literally the most idiotic statement i have ever seen on here
            yes you're right. it should be "always". and your answer is the most idiotic answer I've ever seen here since most of people complain about it. that means you don't follow reddit, or don't play wl.
                oh i do play WL and i do scroll through here randomly.  But people like who blame the game being against them to make up for their lack of skill is flat out comical.
        I still have the game for playing with my friends IRL and maybe pro clubs later this year...stopped playing FUT a week ago tho..was stressing tf out of me😂
        Play the live friendlies way better
        Autoblocks go both ways you know. Without them you would be here day and night raging how your 500k van dijk does nothing and how the game works only for your opponent and how this game is a joke and you will not touch it after 6-2 this weekend.
        Tried first wl this week and stopped at 4-3. My last game was a disconnect when its 4-4 and im all over the opponent.
    I've just stopped playing weekend league this fifa and I'm enjoying it a lot more. I'm just happy building teams and doing the objectives in the friendlies lounge with a load of different players, there's zero stress involved that way. I have a main team for playing against mates or doing squad battles/rivals if I get in the mood but I have barely been on either.
        This person gets it!
        You still get the tryhards in the silver lounge spamming through balls with 90 plus pace players. 👀🤣
            You definitely do 😂! It doesnt seem to bother me as much though because I'm not working with a 30 game deadline or trying to score points to get promoted
    I stopped at silver 3 cause I was going to break my monitor if I played another game
    I stopped at 14-5, I’d say one or two of the losses were to better players than me, the other 3 just to 3 shots 3 goals along with 37 auto blocks for Varane and Gomez.

100% not worth playing on unless you can hit elite comfortably imo
        I'm getting really sick and tired of auto blocks - especially when the player is not even controlling the player auto blocking.
            The only way to avoid it is to play at Club Pro.

You cannot control all players, it is not possible. And it will be more annoying to see one defender not blocking a shoot If he's near the shoot.
        Yeah 100%, I think Gold 2 rewards are better when there’s a possibility of a good TOTW (not the case this week), and Gold1 is really good, but the stress between 14 wins and 20 wins is not worth it, so I agree with you, unless you’re a consistent Elite player, stopping at G3 is the best option
            I got div 1 rank 1 and gold 1 in the same week, 2 100k packs and 2 125k’s,

Only walkout was pique, got that Arbilla guy in reds, disappointment was an understatement, cba with more than gold 2 from now on but tbh my best rewards in fifa 20 were from gold 3 anyway it’s a joke
                Lucky mate. I got gold 1 and didn't get a single board in my 2 100ks. I didn't even know that was possible and I was shocked lmao
                    I opened 5 100k packs due to some objectives and also gold 1 rewards and my best player was Guerreiro lol
    Same situation lol i gave the 8 games away to people. Feeling nice and happy i helped people out while i saved myself from extra stress
    There is no good reason to go over gold 3, unless you are an elite or top 100 player. It is better to focus on getting gold 3 + rank 1 on your division, than sweating it out on Champs because in the end you will most likely get shit red player picks since TOTW is pretty much an outdated concept. We are at a point in the game where what you can get from packs is much more valuable than what you can get in your red player picks.  
I mean, just look at all the TOTW's we had so far where 60 to 70% of the players are discard or near discard, and this last TOTW was the worst one, with only one player being over 100k, and three others having a value over discard, all of the other ones are valued at discard price.  
Rewards need a revamp, both in WL and Rivals. And until EA decides to do that (and it won't be anytime soon), playing to gold 3 and stopping is the only smart thing to do.
    The idea that people stop playing a video game to avoid stress is so funny to me.
        I mean not every game is relaxing, for instance some competitive games.
This is the worst I’ve ever seen hahhaa Fkn hell
I would just delete the game, move to china and turn into a monk. Mental health would need a revamp after that.
Lmfaoo controller smashing pain
I thought I had seen it all with this game wtf
Haha makes me feel good about my weekend 😹
This fucking game man
r/gamephysics
Football Realism ..
Lmao..
Wtf
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Yo whats ur goal song?
    no es mi culpa
        What a fitting song name
            exactly what I was thinking lmao
            For non Spanish speakers, it means "This game is aids"
    I think it’s ‘No Es Me Culpa’
*it’s in the game*
Best goal I’ll ever see in my lifetime, proud to be a part of history in the making
They just based it off of this goal 

https://youtu.be/NLZOmcJVFkA
The real pro move is playing in French. The foreign commentators were always so much more HYPE.

LAZO LAZO LAZO LAZO!!!
    I used to play an old PS1 football game (OG PES I think) with French commentary because the English commentary was *so bad*!
    And the announcer everytime home team score: BAH BAH BAHH!
    Try Dutch commentary
.....
I swear this year’s game physics really went all wonk, as well as the latest update, people just sliding me and not even getting a yellow card, unbelievable
    I was through on goal, defender takes me out from behind and gets only a yellow card. It's just pathetic.
I find the guy who did this to you bro 

https://twitter.com/NicolasCamz_/status/1325097875190243334?s=19
EA fucked us so hard for years, now we just laugh.. We don't complain, thank you EA.
I swear this happens to much. I've had like 3 times that ball was flying with supersonic speed without being kicked that strong. It's like rocket league pinching.
De gea card: scores with saves trait
Remember guys scripting isn't real, get gud you needs /s
Something about not shooting as hard or something.

What the actual fuck happened there that's ridiculous and I hope your opponent scored an og for you.
    isn't OP the one who scored though?
        I don't think it's his video I seen it on twitter after I posted.
The game is finished man, geez
    Unfinished*
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen
what’s the problem? i’ve seen this in real life /s

goalkeeper build different
Noooo I wasted my silver award, you clearly deserved it
If I speak, I am in big trouble
Commentators always saying he uses his feet too much. What now.
This is amazing
Just when I thought I saw some shit this weekend..wow
This game sucks so bad after last update. I deleted it yesterday, no more stress for me. And not playing ever again until they reverse this stupid update.
This is magnificent
I Think I made a mistake buying this game
You know that the whole code and logic of the game is FUCKED when this happens. It s out pf control, game needs to be redone from scratch.
I said I wouldn’t buy the game until I saw reviews in the New Year. I didn’t wait. I am not surprised, but I am still disappointed. And this video essentially sums up my entire FUT21 experience. 

Every game is buggy, something happens where I just sit wondering who said it was good to go. I’ve scored, and conceded, some of the most ridiculous goals on this game. It has never felt so for me or against me, the rebounds, the “penalties”, the players just parting ways. You can feel it about to happen and yet still do nothing to stop it.
    so glad i just check here from time to time, whenever i feel like buying this game, after seeing this, i got enough to say no for another month
I would much rather this happen to me rather than conceding a rebound off a rebound after my defnder tackles the ball 5 times. Atleast I'd get a laugh out of it.
Same old shit in fifa 21?
Well this is what happens when you pay EA to make the same game with new paint for 15 years in a row
I’m glad I didn’t buy this game so far...
We need another football franchise to force them to improve
If I speak I’m in big trouble
HAHAHAHHA FUCK THIS GAMEEEEE
Wait isn't this the fifa people were saying was miles better than 20 just a few weeks ago? I swear the honey moon phase only lasted a few weeks now everyone is starting to see it's the same shit 😂.
Never has a post on this subreddit been able to have as many post flairs as this one...
He just has a good controller 🎮
What a finish..i am getting the same Gk 😂
lol, i wouldnt even be mad if that happened to me. thats hilarious.

unlucky man!
WHAT
God damn it I hate this game
And there are people who don't believe in scripting... 🙄
    Yeah people with an ounce of common sense.
scripting man. I'm wondering if there are legal experts specializing in computer science
And some say scripting isn’t a thing...
This makes me miss being able to shush to the halfway line and dab to assert my superior skill.
Lol. This is your fault. You should have scored.
Unbelievable
Wtf. Damn.
De gea OP
This was my last WL for a while. The game just feels so inconsistent with the cheese and also players feeling sticky. That is unless EA blesses my rewards. Either way, the ps5 is days away so it's time to spend time on other games.
This game never ceases to amaze me
Why Richarlison didnt sign for madrid x100
Camera couldnt keep with the ball flying in the replay lmao
Fifa has had some crazy bugs but this is another level
Stop ittttt!!!!!
WTF?????
Id laugh my ass off if that happened to me hahaha glad none of you skipped the replay either ahhahaha
Finally, De Gea does something positive. Haha.
That’s Volta right? Totally realistic!
Is this a glitch?
Classic rocket league pinch
What in the actual fuck was that
David de Hey Yeeaaaaah
That wasn’t fifa, that was a pinch shot in rocket league
I'd only except this if it was Tim Howard
anyone swearing it’s scripting and not massive engine issues needs to watch this.
EA employees lost no nut november during this clip
I've stopped playing WL! I play friendlies and try to do all objectives its a lot more fun and in a game once me and my opponent realise that the other person will win we just play for objectives and keep the goal difference same. Have made more friends there than I did entire fifa 20.
i cant imagine how furious your opponent is feeling
I'm so happy this happened in your favor at least
This occurred in previous FIFAs too
Peak Fifa. Funny as hell.
De Gea has always had that in his bag.
I literally thought I had seen it all. I was naive.
Makes me fuckin sad to see this. If i could get a refund for Fifa 21 I wouldn't think twice.
During the replay, even the camera was unable to show the ball properly lol.
What the actual
Rocket league pinches be like
😱
Haha. Imagine that it is 117th of extra time and you are leading 4-3. And your opponent scores this type of goal and you have to play penalties... Or even worse. It is draw and he beats you in that way....
During WL nonetheless.
And “this why we love this game”
What the hell
Exactly why I didn’t buy this game or the last 2. Love seeing all the rage and bullshit you guys have happen. 😂🤣😂
How do EA get away with this? I’ll tell you how we keep buying it and putting up with it in the hope it will get better. Reality check
Because when I speak I am in trouble... big trouble
When i so 114 comments i realized it will be something special....but wtf hahahaha
For sure the most unrealistic thing I've seen on fifa
*De Gea price skyrockets in the market*
How do you record your game play from ps4?
    Just press the share button it records the last 15 minutes
The last 15 minutes or the next 15 minutes?
My guy didnt even skip the replay cause he couldnt believe his eyes wtf just happened to him lol
this is why you should quit playing this game in november this year
This is the first fifa I haven't bought since I started playing fifa 15. Seems like a good decision so far.
I see worse from this game
Omg very nice

Lmao I love this game
De gea is just slandered for being a bad goalkeeper, he's meant to be an attacker. 15 Ballon d'or s in a year if he makes the switch.
I hope.this happens on a EA stream in the final
Saves with feet trait OP! right there.
    Happy Cake Day!
DDG in a chelsea kit makes me want to vomit my internal organs out
Rocket league, is that you?
WhaT
Shit game man
Luckiest moment for opponent
This is the most ridiculous goal I've ever seen since I started playing FIFA, back in 2009. Congratulations.
I have nothing to say...........Nothing to say
You went to celebrate SMH 😂
Your keeper should have done better
Err.. what? I already stopped buying FIFA after 19 but it appears they're still making it progressively worse.
Wow just fucking wow!!

There’s one thing being hit on the counter after you should have scored, but that’s just fucking messed up EA 😂
Gotta love the laugh in the celebration. It's like he would call you "dumbass" for paying 70 euro for this game 🤣
Seems legit
Can someone tell me what camera this guy uses?
Jesus
This is absolutely fucked but is definitely to do with the way they’ve buffed rebounds in the last patch. It no longer seems like goalkeepers (even good 90+ rated keepers) ever want to keep hold of the ball and the rebounds don’t feel natural, like the ball will bounce off the keeper’s body at a greater speed than it initially travelled towards him and this is just an extreme example of that. Sad!
Stop supporting these fucking games already.
thats some sick rocket league banger
Jesus 😂😂😂
RIP

Console
Controller

u/Eisfeldinho
oh wow 😂😂
Just stop buying the game until it gets better.. it’s that simpler
F Y S I K S
TF is De Gea in that kit?
No doubt.
The game was enjoyable before they started patching it ...
That is actually very realistic in football... WHEN YOU PLAY ON THE \*\*\*\*IN' MOON!!!
Haha. That’s is absolute gold. Wonderful
Good save by De Gea.
He has a good gaming chair
Nice counter attack tbf
Can't believe I purchased this game again
That reminded me a script goal I did in Fifa18. 

[Fifa18, David Luiz](https://streamable.com/b0gkr0)
Incoming weekly objective requirement

Score with your keeper in your own box
Tbh Seeing Dave in a Chelsea kit is more annoying than the goal.
Yooooo that’s a miracle damn🔥🔥

What the shit
[removed]
No!!
Whenever I think about buying this FIFA I read through the content here
Saves with feet trait is OP
time to put dea gea upfront and see how many games i win, hopefully a lot with that type of finishing.
“We categorically confirm there is no scripted content in game”

...this clip.
...
Shit like this is why i stopped at 13 wins with a game left.
I prefer not to buy this game. HOW ARE THESE THINGS STILL HAPPENING?
I dreamt CD Projekt RED created a football game, it was amazing, especially for people passionate about football and witchery.
And they say Fifa isn't scripted smh
Bro are you sure it's not faked or something like that? :D
Had to nut
Those ball physics tho...
That is the most broken but most brilliant goal I’ve ever seen of fifa. Wow
Somewhat feeling glad that I stopped myself from buying FIFA this year. And believe me it wasn’t easy considering I’ve bought each year since 95.
Ball physics!
I had had enough of FIFA 21 and was about to delete it... then I saw this!!! 😂😂😂😂 You just made my day!
That has to be the most outrageous goal ive ever seen on any FIFA ever...
Ok you win
Salah would still with the Pukas with a tap in
Rebound Karma :D ahahahah
SUPER KEEPER GET HIM HIS PUSKAS AWARD
This is fucking ridiculous hahahahah.
Why does this not surprise me.
Rocket league takes more skill than fifa
I’m lost for words
Fucking YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Trait: scores with feet
Where’s Marcello Bielsa when you need him?
u/vredditdownloader
Please stop giving money to EA.
standart ea. sob.same shit different year.
Them sort of goals get scored every weekend, have you not seen?
This was posted on BR Football’s Facebook page
And people still buy Fifa every year...
Poor guy on the other side. I feel you bro...
Excuse me....
Let's talk when you prefer not to buy.
I don't play FIFA anymore but I keep this subreddit for these kind of contents
This is how Canadians think football looks like
Hahahaha
What the actuall F
De Gea in his prime form.
If only de gea could do that in real life
Someone posted this on IG
Looks like you didn't pay your $99.99 functioning-physics-fee, or maybe you just didn't buy the $119.99 cross-field-goal-blocking ability for your goalie? Spending more money should fix the problem.
And you say this isn’t Rocket League? Somehow knew that ball was going in the net when it crossed the halfway line
This is possible the craziest goal I have ever seen.
Wtf
This is the one boys.
Wtf 😂😂
"Ahh he has taken over the powers of Adrian"

EA glitch gives him a 50 star weak foot
Yooooo lmao, his shot power is a million
Quality strike that.
RIP everything around me if that happened. Sports video games are not my thing
Begovic is doin it again...
That is soo scripted the fact it goes exactly where a keeper cannot get it. 
Amazing game for £60
Whatttttt what fifa is this ?

Omfgg 😭😭😁😁
this game is so shit lmfao.
This has to be the best Fifa clip I have ever seen
Nahhh!
sCrIpTiNG is iN uR hEaD
I didn’t buy the game this year but I come back to this sub probably once a week to check what’s happening, and the top post is always something stupid like this, defo saved my money this year.
EA: but this can happen in real life too right? We are just simulating
Its incredible seeing others experience such things.
OP just came here to say 433 posted this on their instagram page and david de gea commented on it ! He commented 👀
They promised. They delivered.

        Good bot
It’s scripted bro. The game script activated saying there must be a counter and least min 90th goal. The other player’s failure to assist the script made this happen.
And then there are people that seriously believe this is a skill based game and you just need to get good :D
I don't suppose you can remember if you were holding triangle at the time OP?
Every weekend league just gotta stop and think, what the fuck are we playing
Ian Wright spoke abt this clip on his podcast
u/savethisvideo
I am really wondering how fifa decides to do these things.
"Increased distance from Goalkeeper rebounds"
And to think people praise this game...

Just the beauty of the game
The most Fifa-thing i’ve ever witnessed.
And it’s NNN!
I would also nut if this happened for me..
People still claim there is no scripting and it’s all skill...
So you’re telling me that wasn’t De Gea’s highlights vs Everton???
if this was a reoccuring feature I would pay 70€
120 if you wanna play online...
    Not on pc 😁
        [deleted]
            🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ join me on 21:9 widescreen...where i see both goals at once and play at 144hz at the same time at 2k... didnt xbox have a dc glitch? I play on pc...no cheaters as far as i can tell...the lag free menus the high refreshrate in game...so smooth 😁 console is upgrading to "next gen".On pc...you are always on next gen....
                The menus are laggy on PC too...
                    Server lag versus low fps lag are totally different things...sadly we all suffer from bad servers
                    Thats not true at all.
                        I play on PC since Fifa 17. The menus are laggy on PC too.
                            Emm they are not? Force driver side vsync, that geta past 60 in game 😁 (cuz fifa is stupid)
                                Playing with vsync online is impossible for me, too much delay. I'm pretty sure that even with that, we have frames drop in the menus... The game is not well coded.
                            Get a better pc.
                [deleted]
                    i play fifa on pc for over a year now and didnt had any trouble finding matches and almost no cheaters, and the market is ok, but i still agree that it is better on console, but since i have a pc good enough to play it, i prefer than having to pay to play online
                        [deleted]
                            i agree with you, but most of the games i play are on the pc, and where i live ps plus/xbox live is more expensive than 25 dollars
                                [deleted]
                    We've recently hit 1,000,000 transfer listings, wdym by no market? The player base is as big as it's ever been, and cheaters are reeeally hard to find. I've been playing since FIFA 18 and I've come across 2, maybe 3 cheaters.
                    Hhaahhahaah 4k 120hz on a console

I mean I know it's a sports game but hahahahahha

                            Welcome to 2012 my friend...hope you like it and join the darkside 😂
                                This is why people hate the PC community. You guys are all assholes. Fuck the PCMR people too.
                        4k 120hz? You play on that? 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ no you dont...so please stop being a fanboy....
                    120 Hz is the refresh rate dumbass, that's dependent on your monitor not on the game itself...stop tryna talk like you know stuff 😂
                But the FUT pc market contains 10 people haha
                Try and guess how many people actually care
                    I have a PC and PS4 but I don’t care which ones better and I definitely don’t care about your bragging, you can’t be older than 10 surely?
                        Its not braging...monitors are cheap nowdays...a 8 year old pc can run that...far from braging...point is...you can only do that on pc...
            ffs bro stop that stereotype. thinking every single game people cheat. Im not saying it doesnt happen but it happens on both sides (pc and consoles). on fifa(ps4) i had people constantly lag switching it was getting ridiculous
    Why is that?
        You need PS+, in order to play Fifa online, which is another €60/Year
            I mean yes if Fifa is the only game you play if you play other online games that cost comes down majorly even if it's only 4 other games
        gotta buy currency to buy packs
            I mean, you don't have to.
                If you want to be competitive you do
                    Nah you don’t stfu
                        Someone’s a bit grumpy this morning
                            You really dont lol. Never spent any money on fifa points and always finish high in WL and have lots of money just from sbcs and trading to build a nice team
                                > and trading to build a nice team

Making Fifa your second job you mean.

It's clearly Pay 2 Win. Mbappe scores when Jesus doesn't. Jesus scores when Lacazette doesn't.
                                You’re obviously not an average player, mediocre players like myself need to spend money to barely compete with the mbappes neymar and rule breaker teams that are very op in a competent players hands
                            But you don’t, I do decent enough by not spending money, you literally don’t have to
                    I have a friend thats div 2, and he hasn't spent a single penny on the game this year.
                        Gold 1 and div 1 here. Never spent a single dime. After having watched people spending thousands of € only to pull Busquets I decided I’d rather my spend my money otherwise. I think this year it isn’t that much of a problem like it used to be. Came back to fifa after having not played since fifa 15.
Why do you chumps keep falling for it.
    [removed]
        dude, imagine being losing 4-3 and you are about to 4-4 and then this happens. Its even fut champions. I dont break controllers or anything but i will def not play for at least a couple hours.
            Being a bit mad I can understand but if you don't laugh about this if not straight away then later then you are taking it too seriously
        I'm not, I don't even own the game, so I've no reason to be upset with something, I'm just pointing out that time and time again people are unhappy with FIFA but it won't change until you vote with your wallet.


I think this is a hilarious clip as well tbf.
    its a $60/year subscription for roster updates and some small minor tweaks. I play pro clubs with my friends theres never anyone online in old games..it is what it is
        It is what it is? Oof don't accept that, they should and can do better.
            yeah if i had the power to change it i would im as mad as everyone else but idk what else there is to do so...whats the use
                At the end of the day of you don't care then that's fine, if you wanna play games with your mates and stuff then that's cool that's up to you and no one can tell you other wise.

But the way to show you don't accept it is to vote with your wallet.

Unfortunately FIFA have all but monopolised the football genre and we all suffer for it.
                    there is no winning

boring dystopia
*laughs in EA Play*
Final Fantasy 21
This is by far the buggiest FIFA I’ve ever played, they’re not game breaking bugs but just visual glitches that happen every time I play.
    That looks pretty game breaking to me
        I meant the bugs that I’m seeing. I do get one very annoying one when making transfer offers though, if the first bid isn’t accepted then their counter offer is typically 3x the players value(sometimes more).
    This clip looks like it could've been recorded in 2015.. It doesn't look "next gen" at all.
this was a funny bug, happens once per 10 years
This guy table tops.
There's a popular rule for Table Football(Foosball) here in Brazil that GK goals count as 2. Maybe we should start applying it for real football too
    Im pretty sure that's the joke he was making
name 10 matches for the many times?
    Yeah man, this is what we in the business like to call "a joke"
I like to think all EA employees who work on FIFA have to work with a handicap by contract, writing code with one hand. And the contract states you can’t use your dominant one. 
It makes the game seem a bit more understandable.
Has anyone else conceded a goal like this? No.

In a complex simulation things like this happen sometimes, but remember it happens like once in a million matches.
    While I haven't conceded a goal like this, the ball frequently bounces far and fast from a GK save, so it's a quite common issue and this was just on the more extreme end of the issue.

This scenario may happen once in a million matches but the issue is common.
    Something: happens only once to 1 person out of millions

People: wtf this game is so broken
    >Has anyone else conceded a goal like this? No.

There's been several different clips on the subreddit already this FIFA of this happening, then use your lack of brains to try to realise that the majority of FIFA players don't come anywhere near this reddit so, extrapolate.
Everyone says this like it’s a bad thing. Remember though...  it could have been worse!
I stopped at 6-2 this weekend. Fifa 21 now is same as fifa 20 and again strongly felt that it’s not good for my mental health. Removed the game. Always autoblocks, sometimes the game works only for my opponent. That’s enough man. Will never touch this game again
    I stopped at 2-4. You might laugh, but I was winning two games without lag when the server randomly disconnected. No need to damage my mental health over a stupid video game
    See you next week.
    I really only do squad battles and the building challenges because anytime I start to play actual people my blood pressure raises way too high
    "sometimes the game works only for my opponent"- that is literally the most idiotic statement i have ever seen on here
        yes you're right. it should be "always". and your answer is the most idiotic answer I've ever seen here since most of people complain about it. that means you don't follow reddit, or don't play wl.
            oh i do play WL and i do scroll through here randomly.  But people like who blame the game being against them to make up for their lack of skill is flat out comical.
    I still have the game for playing with my friends IRL and maybe pro clubs later this year...stopped playing FUT a week ago tho..was stressing tf out of me😂
    Play the live friendlies way better
    Autoblocks go both ways you know. Without them you would be here day and night raging how your 500k van dijk does nothing and how the game works only for your opponent and how this game is a joke and you will not touch it after 6-2 this weekend.
    Tried first wl this week and stopped at 4-3. My last game was a disconnect when its 4-4 and im all over the opponent.
I've just stopped playing weekend league this fifa and I'm enjoying it a lot more. I'm just happy building teams and doing the objectives in the friendlies lounge with a load of different players, there's zero stress involved that way. I have a main team for playing against mates or doing squad battles/rivals if I get in the mood but I have barely been on either.
    This person gets it!
    You still get the tryhards in the silver lounge spamming through balls with 90 plus pace players. 👀🤣
        You definitely do 😂! It doesnt seem to bother me as much though because I'm not working with a 30 game deadline or trying to score points to get promoted
I stopped at silver 3 cause I was going to break my monitor if I played another game
I stopped at 14-5, I’d say one or two of the losses were to better players than me, the other 3 just to 3 shots 3 goals along with 37 auto blocks for Varane and Gomez.

100% not worth playing on unless you can hit elite comfortably imo
    I'm getting really sick and tired of auto blocks - especially when the player is not even controlling the player auto blocking.
        The only way to avoid it is to play at Club Pro.

You cannot control all players, it is not possible. And it will be more annoying to see one defender not blocking a shoot If he's near the shoot.
    Yeah 100%, I think Gold 2 rewards are better when there’s a possibility of a good TOTW (not the case this week), and Gold1 is really good, but the stress between 14 wins and 20 wins is not worth it, so I agree with you, unless you’re a consistent Elite player, stopping at G3 is the best option
        I got div 1 rank 1 and gold 1 in the same week, 2 100k packs and 2 125k’s,

Only walkout was pique, got that Arbilla guy in reds, disappointment was an understatement, cba with more than gold 2 from now on but tbh my best rewards in fifa 20 were from gold 3 anyway it’s a joke
            Lucky mate. I got gold 1 and didn't get a single board in my 2 100ks. I didn't even know that was possible and I was shocked lmao
                I opened 5 100k packs due to some objectives and also gold 1 rewards and my best player was Guerreiro lol
Same situation lol i gave the 8 games away to people. Feeling nice and happy i helped people out while i saved myself from extra stress
There is no good reason to go over gold 3, unless you are an elite or top 100 player. It is better to focus on getting gold 3 + rank 1 on your division, than sweating it out on Champs because in the end you will most likely get shit red player picks since TOTW is pretty much an outdated concept. We are at a point in the game where what you can get from packs is much more valuable than what you can get in your red player picks.  
I mean, just look at all the TOTW's we had so far where 60 to 70% of the players are discard or near discard, and this last TOTW was the worst one, with only one player being over 100k, and three others having a value over discard, all of the other ones are valued at discard price.  
Rewards need a revamp, both in WL and Rivals. And until EA decides to do that (and it won't be anytime soon), playing to gold 3 and stopping is the only smart thing to do.
The idea that people stop playing a video game to avoid stress is so funny to me.
    I mean not every game is relaxing, for instance some competitive games.
no es mi culpa
    What a fitting song name
        exactly what I was thinking lmao
        For non Spanish speakers, it means "This game is aids"
I think it’s ‘No Es Me Culpa’
I used to play an old PS1 football game (OG PES I think) with French commentary because the English commentary was *so bad*!
And the announcer everytime home team score: BAH BAH BAHH!
Try Dutch commentary
I was through on goal, defender takes me out from behind and gets only a yellow card. It's just pathetic.
isn't OP the one who scored though?
    I don't think it's his video I seen it on twitter after I posted.

Not on pc 😁
    [deleted]
        🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ join me on 21:9 widescreen...where i see both goals at once and play at 144hz at the same time at 2k... didnt xbox have a dc glitch? I play on pc...no cheaters as far as i can tell...the lag free menus the high refreshrate in game...so smooth 😁 console is upgrading to "next gen".On pc...you are always on next gen....
            The menus are laggy on PC too...
                Server lag versus low fps lag are totally different things...sadly we all suffer from bad servers
                Thats not true at all.
                    I play on PC since Fifa 17. The menus are laggy on PC too.
                        Emm they are not? Force driver side vsync, that geta past 60 in game 😁 (cuz fifa is stupid)
                            Playing with vsync online is impossible for me, too much delay. I'm pretty sure that even with that, we have frames drop in the menus... The game is not well coded.
                        Get a better pc.
            [deleted]
                i play fifa on pc for over a year now and didnt had any trouble finding matches and almost no cheaters, and the market is ok, but i still agree that it is better on console, but since i have a pc good enough to play it, i prefer than having to pay to play online
                    [deleted]
                        i agree with you, but most of the games i play are on the pc, and where i live ps plus/xbox live is more expensive than 25 dollars
                            [deleted]
                We've recently hit 1,000,000 transfer listings, wdym by no market? The player base is as big as it's ever been, and cheaters are reeeally hard to find. I've been playing since FIFA 18 and I've come across 2, maybe 3 cheaters.
                Hhaahhahaah 4k 120hz on a console

I mean I know it's a sports game but hahahahahha

                        Welcome to 2012 my friend...hope you like it and join the darkside 😂
                            This is why people hate the PC community. You guys are all assholes. Fuck the PCMR people too.
                    4k 120hz? You play on that? 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ no you dont...so please stop being a fanboy....
                120 Hz is the refresh rate dumbass, that's dependent on your monitor not on the game itself...stop tryna talk like you know stuff 😂
            But the FUT pc market contains 10 people haha
            Try and guess how many people actually care
                I have a PC and PS4 but I don’t care which ones better and I definitely don’t care about your bragging, you can’t be older than 10 surely?
                    Its not braging...monitors are cheap nowdays...a 8 year old pc can run that...far from braging...point is...you can only do that on pc...
        ffs bro stop that stereotype. thinking every single game people cheat. Im not saying it doesnt happen but it happens on both sides (pc and consoles). on fifa(ps4) i had people constantly lag switching it was getting ridiculous
Why is that?
    You need PS+, in order to play Fifa online, which is another €60/Year
        I mean yes if Fifa is the only game you play if you play other online games that cost comes down majorly even if it's only 4 other games
    gotta buy currency to buy packs
        I mean, you don't have to.
            If you want to be competitive you do
                Nah you don’t stfu
                    Someone’s a bit grumpy this morning
                        You really dont lol. Never spent any money on fifa points and always finish high in WL and have lots of money just from sbcs and trading to build a nice team
                            > and trading to build a nice team

Making Fifa your second job you mean.

It's clearly Pay 2 Win. Mbappe scores when Jesus doesn't. Jesus scores when Lacazette doesn't.
                            You’re obviously not an average player, mediocre players like myself need to spend money to barely compete with the mbappes neymar and rule breaker teams that are very op in a competent players hands
                        But you don’t, I do decent enough by not spending money, you literally don’t have to
                I have a friend thats div 2, and he hasn't spent a single penny on the game this year.
                    Gold 1 and div 1 here. Never spent a single dime. After having watched people spending thousands of € only to pull Busquets I decided I’d rather my spend my money otherwise. I think this year it isn’t that much of a problem like it used to be. Came back to fifa after having not played since fifa 15.

    dude, imagine being losing 4-3 and you are about to 4-4 and then this happens. Its even fut champions. I dont break controllers or anything but i will def not play for at least a couple hours.
        Being a bit mad I can understand but if you don't laugh about this if not straight away then later then you are taking it too seriously
    I'm not, I don't even own the game, so I've no reason to be upset with something, I'm just pointing out that time and time again people are unhappy with FIFA but it won't change until you vote with your wallet.


I think this is a hilarious clip as well tbf.
its a $60/year subscription for roster updates and some small minor tweaks. I play pro clubs with my friends theres never anyone online in old games..it is what it is
    It is what it is? Oof don't accept that, they should and can do better.
        yeah if i had the power to change it i would im as mad as everyone else but idk what else there is to do so...whats the use
            At the end of the day of you don't care then that's fine, if you wanna play games with your mates and stuff then that's cool that's up to you and no one can tell you other wise.

But the way to show you don't accept it is to vote with your wallet.

Unfortunately FIFA have all but monopolised the football genre and we all suffer for it.
                there is no winning

boring dystopia
That looks pretty game breaking to me
    I meant the bugs that I’m seeing. I do get one very annoying one when making transfer offers though, if the first bid isn’t accepted then their counter offer is typically 3x the players value(sometimes more).
This clip looks like it could've been recorded in 2015.. It doesn't look "next gen" at all.
Im pretty sure that's the joke he was making
Yeah man, this is what we in the business like to call "a joke"
While I haven't conceded a goal like this, the ball frequently bounces far and fast from a GK save, so it's a quite common issue and this was just on the more extreme end of the issue.

This scenario may happen once in a million matches but the issue is common.
Something: happens only once to 1 person out of millions

People: wtf this game is so broken
>Has anyone else conceded a goal like this? No.

There's been several different clips on the subreddit already this FIFA of this happening, then use your lack of brains to try to realise that the majority of FIFA players don't come anywhere near this reddit so, extrapolate.
I stopped at 2-4. You might laugh, but I was winning two games without lag when the server randomly disconnected. No need to damage my mental health over a stupid video game
See you next week.
I really only do squad battles and the building challenges because anytime I start to play actual people my blood pressure raises way too high
"sometimes the game works only for my opponent"- that is literally the most idiotic statement i have ever seen on here
    yes you're right. it should be "always". and your answer is the most idiotic answer I've ever seen here since most of people complain about it. that means you don't follow reddit, or don't play wl.
        oh i do play WL and i do scroll through here randomly.  But people like who blame the game being against them to make up for their lack of skill is flat out comical.
I still have the game for playing with my friends IRL and maybe pro clubs later this year...stopped playing FUT a week ago tho..was stressing tf out of me😂
Play the live friendlies way better
Autoblocks go both ways you know. Without them you would be here day and night raging how your 500k van dijk does nothing and how the game works only for your opponent and how this game is a joke and you will not touch it after 6-2 this weekend.
Tried first wl this week and stopped at 4-3. My last game was a disconnect when its 4-4 and im all over the opponent.
This person gets it!
You still get the tryhards in the silver lounge spamming through balls with 90 plus pace players. 👀🤣
    You definitely do 😂! It doesnt seem to bother me as much though because I'm not working with a 30 game deadline or trying to score points to get promoted
I'm getting really sick and tired of auto blocks - especially when the player is not even controlling the player auto blocking.
    The only way to avoid it is to play at Club Pro.

You cannot control all players, it is not possible. And it will be more annoying to see one defender not blocking a shoot If he's near the shoot.
Yeah 100%, I think Gold 2 rewards are better when there’s a possibility of a good TOTW (not the case this week), and Gold1 is really good, but the stress between 14 wins and 20 wins is not worth it, so I agree with you, unless you’re a consistent Elite player, stopping at G3 is the best option
    I got div 1 rank 1 and gold 1 in the same week, 2 100k packs and 2 125k’s,

Only walkout was pique, got that Arbilla guy in reds, disappointment was an understatement, cba with more than gold 2 from now on but tbh my best rewards in fifa 20 were from gold 3 anyway it’s a joke
        Lucky mate. I got gold 1 and didn't get a single board in my 2 100ks. I didn't even know that was possible and I was shocked lmao
            I opened 5 100k packs due to some objectives and also gold 1 rewards and my best player was Guerreiro lol
I mean not every game is relaxing, for instance some competitive games.
What a fitting song name
    exactly what I was thinking lmao
    For non Spanish speakers, it means "This game is aids"
I don't think it's his video I seen it on twitter after I posted.

    Hhaahhahaah 4k 120hz on a console

I mean I know it's a sports game but hahahahahha

            Welcome to 2012 my friend...hope you like it and join the darkside 😂
                This is why people hate the PC community. You guys are all assholes. Fuck the PCMR people too.
        4k 120hz? You play on that? 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ no you dont...so please stop being a fanboy....
    120 Hz is the refresh rate dumbass, that's dependent on your monitor not on the game itself...stop tryna talk like you know stuff 😂
But the FUT pc market contains 10 people haha
Try and guess how many people actually care
    I have a PC and PS4 but I don’t care which ones better and I definitely don’t care about your bragging, you can’t be older than 10 surely?
        Its not braging...monitors are cheap nowdays...a 8 year old pc can run that...far from braging...point is...you can only do that on pc...
If you want to be competitive you do
    Nah you don’t stfu
        Someone’s a bit grumpy this morning
            You really dont lol. Never spent any money on fifa points and always finish high in WL and have lots of money just from sbcs and trading to build a nice team
                > and trading to build a nice team

Making Fifa your second job you mean.

It's clearly Pay 2 Win. Mbappe scores when Jesus doesn't. Jesus scores when Lacazette doesn't.
                You’re obviously not an average player, mediocre players like myself need to spend money to barely compete with the mbappes neymar and rule breaker teams that are very op in a competent players hands
            But you don’t, I do decent enough by not spending money, you literally don’t have to
    I have a friend thats div 2, and he hasn't spent a single penny on the game this year.
        Gold 1 and div 1 here. Never spent a single dime. After having watched people spending thousands of € only to pull Busquets I decided I’d rather my spend my money otherwise. I think this year it isn’t that much of a problem like it used to be. Came back to fifa after having not played since fifa 15.
At the end of the day of you don't care then that's fine, if you wanna play games with your mates and stuff then that's cool that's up to you and no one can tell you other wise.

But the way to show you don't accept it is to vote with your wallet.

Unfortunately FIFA have all but monopolised the football genre and we all suffer for it.
    there is no winning

boring dystopia
I opened 5 100k packs due to some objectives and also gold 1 rewards and my best player was Guerreiro lol
Server lag versus low fps lag are totally different things...sadly we all suffer from bad servers
Thats not true at all.
    I play on PC since Fifa 17. The menus are laggy on PC too.
        Emm they are not? Force driver side vsync, that geta past 60 in game 😁 (cuz fifa is stupid)
            Playing with vsync online is impossible for me, too much delay. I'm pretty sure that even with that, we have frames drop in the menus... The game is not well coded.
        Get a better pc.
i play fifa on pc for over a year now and didnt had any trouble finding matches and almost no cheaters, and the market is ok, but i still agree that it is better on console, but since i have a pc good enough to play it, i prefer than having to pay to play online

        i agree with you, but most of the games i play are on the pc, and where i live ps plus/xbox live is more expensive than 25 dollars
