[[Subreddit Name Change to rEASportsFC]]


Hello everyone,

As we move into a new era of ~~FIFA~~ EASportsFC and with the help from amazing Reddit Admins like u/HackneyCricket and u/PossibleCrit , our subreddit has been officially renamed to r/EASportsFC 

We are excited for the future of the franchise and we can't wait to see what's ahead.


We will slowly work on getting things updated on our sidebar, wiki, sticky threads, etc to reflect the new changes so please bear with us for a few days.

Thank you and remember to join us at our Official [Discord  Server](https://discord.gg/redditfifa) to interact with members of the community.

Cheers!


Wouldn't have minded if is stayed r/FIFA tbh, we'll probably just call the new game fifa 24 anyway.

        I thought I was banned lmao
            I thought I drunkenly accidentally unsubbed and wonder what thread made me flustered enough to do it lol
        they really should have given us some warning
    EA Sports FC is such a mouthful. 

I would have just preferred to call it EA FC. 

I think FIFA might stick to people' tongue the first year but eventually it will fade out. Without consistent branding, and that being a damn corrupt organization, I don't think it would take more than a year for people to really start transitioning to calling it EASFC.
        Not sure about that, I mean it's been called fifa for decades. Unless they mess the game up more than they already have I think it will stick.
            People still call it weekend league even though it‚Äôs been FUT Champions for awhile
                Exactly, I think I'll always call it WL it just sounds better
                I had no idea it wasn‚Äôt called weekend league I thought it was unchanged from 2016
        ill be calling it Electronic Arts Sports Football Club de Internacional
    It's likely promoted  by EA in some way. Nobody wants to call the game that.
    Also would‚Äôve been nice to get some warning or announcement. Found this by chance.
    Let's all deliberately call it fifa 24 in every post ever from now on ü§£
I will never get over how corporate the new name is.
    It may as well be called Football Themed Content & Engagement Generator 24
        I love FTCEG 24.

Sounds like a solid contability app.
    Actually an awful name
    How is this any more corporate than the old one? FIFA is literally the acronym of the world's largest football association.
        because everyone grew with up with the name so they dont associate it with corporate
        Fifa is atleast technically a non profit organisation. I get why they chose this name but adding ea sports to it is just too much corpo.

Everyone will still just fall it fifa
            >Fifa is atleast technically a non profit organisation

I fell off my chair laughing when I read this :'-)
            Can hardly call it FC tho
    Wtf was fifa though? Not like a global organization rife with bribery and thuggishness was a good name?
        FIFA at least made sense, it's the global football organisation 

This new name sounds like EA tried to rip off Wii Sports
    Logo is great though.
        not a fan of it, but its not bad. could deffo be executed better tho imo
Why so soon though?
    Agree this could have happened a month or so before EASFC is set to drop, feels weird not going to /r/fifa anymore when that's the active game we're all playing...
    We do agree it's a bit too soon but the opportunity to get this done right now with the help from Reddit Admins was what worked best.

EA Sports FC will start to get heavily promoted in the very near future so by the time the new name is all over the place, current members will be used to the sub new name and new members will have the ability to find us easier.

In a few words, we are closer to calling the franchise EA Sports FC that we are to still calling it FIFA.
        I do think it will still be called Fifa even when it‚Äôs not officially ‚Äòfifa‚Äô.
            Maybe. When Championship Manager became Football Manager people spent a while calling it 'the new Champ Man', until the existence of a different Championship Manager made that unworkable. Remember there will be a new FIFA, even if it is terrible the name will confuse people.
            From older players, sure. The new name will eventually overtake it as new/younger players start playing it.
                That‚Äôs not how language works. The one that is the most practical will be the one that gets used.

I think it‚Äôs called an eponym, like when people refer to vacuum cleaners as hoovers or tissues as Kleenex. It will be marketed as easportsfc but that‚Äôs a mouthful, fifa is short and sweet.
                    yeah crypto.com arena has been around for a year but people im sure will still call it staples center
                    I do agree on this. 

In the country I was raised, the first diapers to come around after the communism were the Pampers, and people are used to calling them ‚Äúpampers‚Äù now. I don‚Äôt even think there is a word in my language for diapers, and I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúpampers‚Äù all my life.

                        If it is successful.

Honestly, if a big publisher takes the FIFA name and makes it an actual worthy competitor to EA, it may end up what football gaming has badly needed for so long. Not holding my breath, of course, but maybe that FIFA game ends up being the one everyone plays and pours money into, while EAFC becomes a historical sidenote. May that be. Amen.
        But it‚Äôs still called fifa how are we closer to calling it easfc. That‚Äôs like calling someone 30 at 29 because they‚Äôre almost 30
        Right, that makes sense.

Going to take a while to get used to this new name though üòÖ
        shouldn't you also change your username to 'EASportsFCModerators' ?
        But it's still fifa and doing this without warning is a joke. I would have been baffled if a post didn't appear on my front page
This was a mistake tbh
This feels odd

E: Finally my flair is fixed, I used to always see the xbox logo only haha
    I feel like EA have gotten ahold of this sub. The moderators on r/fifa were always terrible. Wouldn't be surprised if they were receptive to outright shilling, and and this feels like a very corporate move.

Would recommend r/fut instead for FUT users. It's a much better place to actually discuss the game without having your posts removed 24/7 because they violate some arbitrary rule.
        r/fut needs better moderation ‚Äî most posts are just potato quality pictures of people‚Äôs TVs or nonsensical complaining about the game. the entire place feels insanely young.
        Subbed! Didnt know it existed. Fuck this place im moving.
        They will soon come for r/fut as well.
So this sub is ran by EA? Because only they would change the subs name like this, especially months early to promote it
You should have announced this prior. I had to go to r/fut to find out what was going on because r/fifa was still on my list but said it was private
So unnecessary. Is FIFAModerators also gonna delete their account and create EAFCModerators?
    If their names include: FIFA. Yes.
too soon imo but i guess you do you
Weird I‚Äôm still playing fifa 23
Could have given us even the slightest bit of warning‚Ä¶

Good to know that all the old discussion, tactics posts, and replays are now gone forever with no advanced warning. Great job!

Edit: The irony of this being posted by someone named ‚ÄúFIFAModerators‚Äù is palpable
    They still exist, the Reddit database just needs to update before the search function will work. Any posts you made in this sub are still there and can be accessed, so everyone else's can be as well if you know the post ID.
        That‚Äôs good to know! It must have taken a while to update; now I can see the old posts albeit with the different sub name.

Just weird to me to make this change before the game is even out with zero warning. Makes me wonder if EA really does have a presence in the sub‚Ä¶
            They probably do to an extent, the same with 2K I think(?) since both of their discords are the 'official' one for both games and being the biggest sub for them 

They won't just let some random people use their name and branding, it's not surprising
    [removed]
Lmao fucking shameful
But the current game(s) is Fifa, why would you change the name preemptively like this? Anyone not already in the community will have no clue what to look for.
Bruh the game is coming out in 4 months
Great change. Now when you search a thread on google you can‚Äôt access it because it‚Äôs private üôè
Everyone is still gonna call it fifa, it's been the name for decades so i doubt it will fade very quickly
Way too son
Wtf is this shit
EA must have lined those pockets well, no user asked for this surely?
How can I access all the good tactics and formation posts of the old sub now? 

Don't tell me I'll have to use [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) all the time.
    All the content should still be there. Nothing got deleted, the sub just got renamed.

However, if you have any saved URLs/bookmarks, those will need to be renamed to /easportsfc/ instead of /fifa/

Reddit's search engine might also take a bit before it indexes everything under the new name so it might take a bit to find old posts manually.

If you find any example of something that is broken, even after changing the URL, please link it here so we can take a look and if necessary contact admins for assistance.
        it says the sub is locked when looking at threads via google search.
            Replace the "/r/FIFA" in the URL with "/r/easportsfc"
Feels too soon but aight
A warning would have been nice, so I didn't have to try to figure out why r/fifa was private
    I just found it after checking periodically all day lmao
Isn‚Äôt there like 4 months until the new game?!
Why now? It‚Äôs still FIFA
So much for that confused message I sent about why I‚Äôm not a member of r/fifa and how I would like to become one‚Ä¶.missed the memo lol
That dude with the hundreds of subreddits lost?
was there no r/EAFC?
    Some guy had originally grabbed this sub name when EA first registered the trademark, so once the news came out that the video game would no longer be called FIFA, he offered the name to this sub's mods but demanded that he should become head mod over them. He also grabbed EAFC. 

I grabbed EAFootball just in case it was needed, but it looks like the Reddit admins stepped in and transferred this name to avoid confusion.
Yeah i agree, bit too soon
L decision
I mean, the one we are playing right now is called FIFA lol
I went to Twitter to find out why the sub was down. Good job giving a heads up /s
I got so confused at seeing this in my subbed list, didn't know subreddits could change names. That's pretty cool!
Yeah I hate this.
April fools was last month
Why? Its a shit name. Should've just kept FIFA until some other game is called FIFA.
    Because the organisation FIFA wanted EA to pay like 250 million per year for the name Fifa.
EA didn't want to pay so there's a name change
100% a move by EA. So they can get players used to the new name as soon as they can
Why not just wait until this cycle is over? Makes way more sense. Why 4 month early?!
Everyone is still going to call the game FIFA so the name change seems unnecessary unless you're trying to appease our EA overlords.
I mean, this sub only discusses Ultimate Team anyway.
Massive L
Goofy
Boooo urns
Dumb af
I can't access the main reddit page..
I can't view community pops up when I try to access the front page.
Sounds so bad
Move makes more sense to make in the summer. But can't fault wanting to get ahead of things early
    It is really weird that this whole thread seems to be crying about it. who cares what the subreddit is called?
        Some things in life you will care more than others, and they will ask you the same question. Personal preferences
Good move, this will avoid confusion going forward. I bet that guy who originally parked this sub name is pissed.
I can only open and comment on this thread, everytime I click on the new subreddit it says I'm not allowed to view this community.
Sad day :(
what happened to those dudes who were squatting that name?
when does wl end guys? it says 1day and 3 hours , no way thats true right?
    It‚Äôs true. Gets extended during TOTS. Wish it was always this way
Should have just been /r/FIFA.
meanwhile Hogwarts legacy sub is still called /r/HarryPotterGame lol 

unnecessary change but in the end idc
great, now the subreddit search is broken. awesome idea guys
Why can't I view the new subreddit but I can access this mega? üòÇ
