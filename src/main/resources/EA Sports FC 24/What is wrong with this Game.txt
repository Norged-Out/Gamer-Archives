[[What is wrong with this Game]]





lmfao that is truly the best shit ive ever seen 
    Don't mind me just mowin the lawn
        Barrow dude is just chewing the grass down
        Mower of lawn!
            DELIGHTFUL!
        That‚Äôs more of a vacuuming motion
            What kind of vacuum do you have that needs two hands 
    They‚Äôre just doing the wheelbarrow, great core exercise.
    Yep, it truly is. I'm gonna save it for when I need a laugh on rough days.
    I‚Äôm crying üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Thats freakin hilarious. Best post in a while man

        hear hear *
        Seriously, havent seen this many upvotes on a 'goodnatured' post in a long time
Thats probably the funniest thing I have ever seen on this subreddit tbh
    I would say the game is unplayable, did you see #5 pass right through the player with his head on the ground?
        Every EA game ever.

        Hi Krasi. 
    (ALMOST DIED)
    The lawnmower
The pitch has to be kept in pristine condition somehowüòÇ
    >	grass was too high

-Xavi, probably
Can we talk about how great of a teammate Marcelo is for not letting the ball hit him. 
    Then bending time and physics by merging fully through him without causing any physical harm.
        GOAT
        That's the impressive thing. I once had a friend clip through me and the physics launched me violently away and I slammed into a wall and broke my ribs.
    Instead, Marcelo swiftly drives his left boot through his head, but miraculously he is left unharmed.
Would love for something like this to happen during the regionals
    *and here's the absolutely best icon for mowing the grass, fantastic teeth, extraordinary work rates. you WILL need him if pitch condtitions are close to your heart!*
        **Did we mention that the 4th official is just 16?**
Fucking hell lmao
Haha this actually made me laugh out loud can‚Äôt stop watching it.
lawn mower
    Wheelbarrow
    Mower of Lawn ! Wonderful
        Yildaraz must be DELETED!
    Hey FIFA 18 with a new grounds keeping mode! 
How does this even happen
    Idk. The guy with this substitution thing walked around the pitch the whole game and suddenly a player replaced that board lmao
        Might be some bugs in this game...
            Maybe.
        the board is attached to the legs of the player lol, not replaced totally
        Please tell me you made more recordings

    A better question would be, why would this type of interaction even be programmed into the game?  There is no purpose I can think of other than this exact thing happening and if that is the case, it is probably for free publicity.
I may never laugh this hard again.
    [How about now?](https://youtu.be/eRcGx6X6W5Q)
        This is hilarious... the best part is that he then got up and scored!
            Oh he definitely scored üòè
        r/glitches_gone_sexual
This explains why the refs are terrible in this game.. Trimming the focking grass in the mid of a game.. Jesus... 
    You said it, man.
That is the greatest. 
LOL THIS IS THE BEST THING IVE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE FIFA LIFE 
"God damnit Phil. I said to cut the grass with the **lawnmower**, not the **loan-player**"
I litteraly spilled my coffee laughing. 
I just had the best laugh

New wheelbarrow race mode
Hahaha oh man. Legit laughed out loud. Thanks for posting. 
Sometimes I'm scaed that AI is going to take over all jobs.

But then I realize that the coffee machine at work has constant software crashes and EA's FIFA is in an even worse state.
This must be funniest fifa video i've seen.
lol, wtf?
Marcelo gives no fuck :(
New celebration in FIFA 19. 
Heading: 99 
Grassing : 99
Matthew Mzizi must have been involved in some way. 
Taking a baby icon for stroll in d park
how do u think the grass gets cut?
Us. 
We all saying that the game is shit, but we are still playing. 
The game is fucked up, but at least we can laugh about things like this lmao, this is funny as hell
Seems the groundskeeper had unfinished business
It appears they were having a wheelbarrow race in the middle of a soccer game.
    You dropped this \

I love everything about this!I laughed solid for at least 2 minutes while trying to eat cereal! From the commitment of the game to make this happen to the ref noping the F out on the other side of the screen. It's like watching that baseball team that trolls the interviews! I'm just going to wheelbarrow this guy across the field. No biggie. Everybody continue what you were doing!
Gotta keep the lawn trimmed 
Top 5 Post of all Time on this Sub wtf üòÇ Thank you guys <3
This is one of the best things I've ever watched

Nothing /s

Didn't expect that lol
The Best Yet!!  The wheelbarrow !!
Lol surely making front page this

Crying üòÇ
That‚Äôs fucking Hilarious üòÇ 
Oh my days how I laughed!
The Beautiful Game

As if there was ever a doubt the referees favored Madrid. Uefadrid!!!!
Wtf. You couldnt make this stuff up. 
Wtf üòÇüò∑
Doesn't show a lot of determination to win the ball though... 
It sucks
What an interception by Marcelo
Don't judge him, he's just cutting the grass
MwahahaHahahahah I can‚Äôt stop laughing 
üòÇüòÇüòÇ can‚Äôt write this shit!
Nothing, literally nothing.
r/Unexpected
I can safely say I wasn't expecting that...if only that happened in the box and he scored the header offf the wheelbarrow
E SPORTS READY everything else gtfo of the way
lmao....best thing i have ever seen
LMAO
What a great metaphor of how EA (the ref) deals with its community (the head slider). 
What happened is you almost interrupted the ref in the middle of his wheelbarrow race. Nothing else to see here...
EVERYTHING
AMAZING. 
Hahahahaha nice one
Please tweet this to EA, would deffo bang
    Bleacher report already contacted me haha
*The human lawnmower*
Interesting, I don't ever remember seeing these sort of glitches on FIFA 13 (or even PES 2017 from last year) and I played a tonne. I dunno what it is about the physics of modern FIFA games.
hahahahahaha this is amazing
Lmao
Thank you for this. I really love stuff like this, but the fact that it is fifa makes it 100x better!

Serious deep laughter. Thanks again!
I laughed way too harder than i should have
What do you mean?
Funniest moment with Fifa 18..
What the fuck did I just see???
ah yes, the wheelbarrow. a common celebration, you‚Äôd know that if you were cultured 
They have to trim the grass somehow 
The answer is everything
Vaccum Cleaner
Lol
Answer: absolutely nothing
Jus the ref mowing the grass with a sub... is that not normal?
Everything seems fine
Oh I loled
We have a winner. You win everything!
Matthew Mzizi would never let this shit happen on his pitch

/r/BetterEveryLoop
Lol reminds me of Subbuteo figures
Meanwhile i concede 2 fucking penalties because of AI auto switch and fucking input lag. Dominating the fucking game as well but didnt score shit. Fucking EA

There's no way this isn't a mod lmfao how does this even happen
    It wasn‚Äôt a mod. Happened in squad battles but I have no idea how
        üòÇ
haha wtf
I believe that's called "The Wheelbarrow"
" carrim de mao da da, para ara pa"
That's not what I expected to see I'll be honest

LMAO 
Back in my day we had to mow the lawn- WITH OUR TEETH!
Taczka :D
One of the many reasons I didn't even bother to buy FIFA this year.
I haven't played the FIFA game in years, had no clue they decided to go arcadie route! lol 
How? Why?
Funniest thing I‚Äôve seen on this sub, fucking fantastic game 
This is just wayyy too funny hahahahaha!
Marcelo giving zero fucks.
r/fifagifs
Im dead
    F
Can this game get any better?!
Crazy
Just mowing the grass
good way to keep costs down, its an organic lawnmower. 

You watch, i bet United put 100 guinea pigs on the pitch before their next game to cut the grass.


Wow.
I just tought i will see another rebound goal or something...but this..oh man...this is next level.. made my day
r/gamephysics 

I fuckin snorted. This caught me by a complete surprise hahahahah
How the fuck even
Lmfao
One of your bronze bench guys got too tired of never playing and decided to be the lawnmower. 
When the game already started but the grass is fucked...lawnmower timeeee
ROLF so un3xpected
Fuck this game. 
It's a pretty standard play.
Is this a new celebration?
    It better be in the next game
    Hopefully it‚Äôs in the next game haha
This was a truly DELIGHTFUL moment.
Classic wheel Barrow 
Is that not normal in soccer? No wonder they never let me play with them...
Don't mind me, just walking my black guy.
Hahahahahaha loved it
This gets better every time I see it!
This is the single most fucking hilarious thing I have ever seen in FIFA in recent times, omfg xDDDDD
I want to be part of history!!!
