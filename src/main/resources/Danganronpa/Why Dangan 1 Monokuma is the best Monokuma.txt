[[Why Dangan 1 Monokuma is the best Monokuma]]





I like to think that monokuma is actually somehow verbally speaking the emojis when he says them

monokuma: <(*-*<) ^(*-*)^ (>*-*)>

makoto: "HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT WITH YOUR MOUTH?"
    "Never mind how I'm doing it!  What do you have to say for yourself?"
        "Can I get a caramel macchiato?"
    You don’t have to think it. It’s canon. I believe Yasuhiro’s the one who acknowledges them as emoticons
    Reminds me of the Ace Attorney games when characters say something like “Hey Phoenix, try pressing A!”
One aspect i really enjoyed about Dangan 1 Monkuma >!(and by extension Junko)!< was their dynamic with Makoto. They seemed to actively taunt Makoto a lot more than the other protags, made me smile whenever they get an interaction outside of their Dangan 1. They seem to really care about him in their own...........awful way, lol.
    Which made sense in the context of the 3 games as well. >!Junko/Monokuma knew Makoto very well unlike how Dangan 2 and 3 Monokuma really didn't have a pre-existing personal relationship with the protagonist.!<
    >!Prolly since Junko personally knew all of them, she knows how to trigger them !<
        >!Trigger them a happy havoc?!<
    Awful way? They were invested in two things: Despair and Makoto getting laid.
>!That one about his butt and hips was definitely just Junko talking about herself!<
    When did that happen
        when he shows his fat ass on screen
Danganronpa 1 Monokuma definitely feels like the most iconic monokuma.
>!Probably because Junko was operating him!<
He's so goddamn evil yet funny as hell, love this guy
    Exactly. Dangan 1 Monokuma was downright hilarious. I found it impossible to dislike him.
        Yup facts
    Same
I think it’s because Nagito and Kokichi took up so much spotlight in the sequels.
    Yeah, >!while Byakuya screwed up 2-2 he didn't do something too significant besides that (At least not at Nagito and Kokichi level)!< so Monokuma was much more present
    Plus, there were other mascots taking some spotlight in the sequels
        there weren’t, actually! I have no memory of these “other mascots”
            girl what there was monomi/usami in 2 and the monocubs in 3
                I know, my comment was a joke because I hate them and like to pretend they don’t exist. Sorry I realize that wasn’t clear haha
                    OH lmao
                    Whatever monomi did to you 😭
                    Hey, you leave my cute sunshine ball Usami alone.

...

You can hate the Monokubs, I won't argue.
            I like monomi but the monokubs……
No Buff Monokuma in this one, though. 😔
    And Ball Monokuma 😔
Was the removed thing actually removed or is that what it says everywhere
    that’s what it says even in the original japanese version
        Its sad that the joke doesn't translate too well because Japanese media frequently and brutally gets censored for American releases.

Makes me sad. Why can't we just have nice things.
I think it’s because in 2 and v3 they rely more on Monokuma doing physical comedy, like his buff version and the machine gun thing, as well as having a comedy partner, which combined with 2 and v3 having kookier casts in general means that his comedy in 1 has to hold up more strongly on its own as pure comedy, so it ages better as screenshots
My favorites are ‘[REMOVED TO CONFORM WITH LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL CENSORSHIP LAWS]’ and ‘I’m not mad! >_<‘
    You're leaving out the best part of that quote! The full thing was "I bet you guys- [REMOVED TO CONFORM WITH LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL CENSORSHIP LAWS] -all over her!" Which makes it way funnier
Gotta love him
I have a friend who quotes the “flagpole” line to a ludicrous degree, literally any situation all the time
    Its my favourite lmao.
Dr1 got the best vibe in the entire series, and in my (not biased) (totally humble) ((kyoko is in it)) opinion, is the best game in the series. The feeling of dread is unmatched in later games, along with the feeling of unknown. Just barely beats V3.
He has a brilliant mind behind those demented bear eyes in the first one
I always laugh at his puns so I guess he is the best
It's probably because he's on his own here, there's no Monomi or Monokubs to take up any limelight.
"U N B E L I E V A B L E"
... >!I wonder if Monokuma is just Junko's true personality!<
For me Monokuma stops working when you give him other mascot sidekicks. Then he just focuses on being a f*cking bully for them and I don't find it funny, I just feel bad for them. I mean Monokuma is always a bully but the students bite back more than the mascots, Usami and Monocubs feel pretty powerless which is just sad
this deadass might be why >!Junko is one of my top two favorite characters in the series, shes unhinged to all hell but she makes it fun!!<
That 2nd to last one is my favorite lmaoo actually genius
I love THH monokuma
Finally!! Someone's agreed. He was so ...idk how to explain it
I forgot the 3rd and 5th one
It’s so hard to hate him despite the fact that he’s a vile piece of crap
The first games Monokuma is the best Monokuma because >!junko is controlling him!<
I mean….he does have a nice butt
It’s so ironic how both my most disturbing memories and best comedic relief moments came from this damn bear.
I actually prefer 2 Monokuma, his Monokuma Theatre bits are so funny to me.
Yes. Just yes.
Yes
V3 Monokuma is just a bruh
PHAT ASS
Yeah but but but jibakuma
he’s so silly
I'd say V3 monokuma is the best one, he also has the best sprites.
    Sounds like Mickey Mouse though 😔
        it's the same voice actor in english though??? (unless you mean JP then i dunno)
            No like when he's first introduced the English VA was \*not\* doing great and you can tell. It gets somewhat better over time but still isn't quite OG Monokuma in sound.
    They're technically well done sprites, but they have so much less personality compared to the originals.
        I disagree.
Hope's peak academy's trip executive committee has an announcement to make. Good morning everyone! It's another wonderful tropical day. Let's show some enthusiasm and give it our all today!
Even junko is scared of censorship
Bottomkuma
