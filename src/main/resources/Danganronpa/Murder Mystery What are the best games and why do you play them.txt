[[Murder Mystery What are the best games and why do you play them]]


So I've recently become rather fixated on Murder mystery games. Having recently begun playing Crime & Punishment: Sherlock Holmes (never played a sherlock holmes game before) and LA:Noir it got me curious as to what other games are out there that I could be possibly missing out on.

For me I love the thrill of the chase, the puzzle solving and putting all the clues together to solve the case. I may never be a real detective but this is close as I can get :)

So tell me. What do you think is a great Murder Mystery game and what makes you think so?


Ghost Trick is a great murder mystery. Available on the DS and iOs I believe. Not sure about Android. I think the first part is free on iOs but I don't know, played it on the DS.

You are dead right from the beginning and you use your ghostly powers to interact with objects in the 2D world. This can include playing with a Rube Goldberg machine or just opening a cabinet. You don't really play the detective role similar to something like Phoenix Wright, but the game does drop hints that you will notice on a second playthrough that foreshadow a lot of twists. It has a lovely art style with amazing animations and the story begins with a ghost lamp telling you what to do. 

It's great and the story doesn't just rely on trying to find out who killed you. One of the best games on the DS for me. 
    Not to be "that" guy, but his name is Rube Goldberg, not Rude :P
        Fuck. Thanks. 
    Ghost Trick is my #1 game for DS. I haven't enjoyed any game more in the library more than I enjoyed GT. I 100% recommend it to anyone that has a DS or can get it on iOS.

The one flaw that I have with it is that I think it holds your hand far too much. Like, it has some sort of 'tutorial' from beggining to end... And I really hope a sequel comes out some day, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.
    It has easily one my favorite stories in any video game. Don't let it's simple gameplay fool you. It can be truly devilish at times. 

I just checked and unfortunately it's not on the Android app store so if you don't have an apple device you'll have to hunt down one of the increasingly rare and valuable cartridges. 

On another note definitely check out Layton Brothers: Mystery Room for your purest murder mystery game. As far as I know it's only on ios though. But it's dirt cheap and the first episode is free. Made by the same people who give you professor Layton. 
        I thoroughly enjoyed Layton Brothers, but I found that around the final chapter or so I was falling into the old pattern of "TRY EVERYTHING WITH EVERYTHING" that the Phoenix Wright games have a bad habit of doing.
    ghost trick is amazing. ios port is great, get that
    I loved Ghost Trick, but I wouldn't really classify it as a "murder mystery" like many of the other games since figuring out whodunnit isn't really a primary objective of the game as you point out (after all the protagonist doesn't really care). That being said it's still an amazing game and I agree with your recommendation wholeheartedly.
    I cannot recommend this game enough. I really like Phoenix Wright, it's one of my favourite series in fact, but this game just blows it out of the water story-wise.

In gameplay it's very different from the usual visual novel. It's not based on choices or linguistic trickery like in PW, but rather on traditional puzzle design. But the story... oh man the story. It's simply said amazing. The twist and turns this game features are unlike anything I've seen before and even though I managed to predict one of the big reveals in the game, actually being right and realizing all the foreshadowing was stunning.

The peculiar premise that sets it apart from other games also differs from the traditional murder mystery, however, in the sense that you're not solving other murders, but rather your own. You start the game as an amnesiac ghost trying to find out his identity, history and murderer, while preventing deaths during the actual game.

This is one of the only games that, when I finished it, made me feel sad that the story was over. I had grown so attached to the characters and knowing that the story had been beautifully resolved and that there (probably) won't be a sequel was enough to keep me from playing other games for a couple of days.

Definitely one of the best DS games. Would certainly recommend.

It also helps that the music was made by the composer of the PW games and is, thus, godly.
    To add to this: Ghost Trick is written by Shu Takumi. The same guy who created Ace Attorney.
You can't really go anywhere without saying Phoenix Wright. It's a bit of a different take, but the mysteries are definitely well written, and the cast of characters fun with a great soundtrack to boot.

Kind of similar is Dangan Ronpa, which is kind of a mix of Phoenix Wright and Battle Royale.
    Yep. The big three in my mind are Phoenix Wright, DanganRonpa, and 999/Virtue's Last Reward.

Phoenix Wright alone has 5 base games and two spinoff games (Edgeworth series), each with 4-5 murder cases. The first three tie so well together though, that the climax of game 3's final case makes the series the best i've ever played.
        anyone who likes these games should honestly give umineko a try. It my favorite of the genre.
            Umineko is really really really meta (though still an incredible piece of fiction). Higurashi is a lot more "traditional" (and a lot more horror focused).
                Was planing on playing umineko soon as I enjoyed the higurashi anime(and  i am waiting on the steam release of the game) anything I need to know going in other then the fact the translation might not be the best?
                    The translation is pretty rock solid. There's a patch that updates the sprites/art and adds voice acting (ripped from the PS3 version). It's really nice.
                        That is good to know think i'm going to play it after world end economica ep 1 as I picked that up during the steam auction
        I started 999 and it was very interesting but after about 2:30 hours my DS froze and I lost my savefile for some fucking reason. Too lazy to start over, but everytime I see the game's name I get reminded of how much I missed out on.
            You should definitely play it, it's worth the same.
            Considering you need to play the game at least 5 or 6 times to get the true ending, starting over is something you should be planning on doing with it. ;)

It's very worth it, I'd definitely say to try it again.
            I got hit by that twice. Just never save when you're in a puzzle room.
                OHHHH, that's probably what caused it. Pretty sure it froze while saving and I was booting up the DS thinking 'please don't erase my progress'
        Game 3 Case 5 is easily my favorite of the series. The only thing that really comes close is the second Edgeworth game.
    Before *Phoenix Wright* there was a 90s FMV game with the same premise called *In the First Degree*. Never played it, but it got good reviews at the time. I wonder if it's worth checking out.
The people over at /r/boardgames have gone crazy for Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective ever since the shutupandsitdown review of it went up on their website. It's sort of a choose your own adventure style game where you're given a map of London, a fictional directory, a book of encounters, and a main book for the narrative. You read about the case, then decide to follow up on leads by looking up the places mentioned in the directory, then go to the encounters book to read what happens when you show up to the place to interview people. 
    This sounds interesting. How does it incorporate multiple players? You know what I'll just look it up myself. Thanks. 
        [Here](http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/blog/post/review-sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective/) is the review that made the game sell out overnight and get a modern reprint.
Going for more detective game vs murder mystery, but you should play the 999 series.  9 strangers wake up and find themselves together.  Mysterious voice over the intercom says they have 9 hours to escape otherwise they will all die.  To progress further they have to go into rooms in groups and solve puzzles in them.  While you solve them you get bits of story lore, stories about science experiments, and you find out who the other people are and what they did prior to waking up here. It is absolutely one of my favorite DS games.

The sequel Virtue's Last Reward I thought was even better than the first.  Can't talk too much about that one without spoilers to the first game, but that makes sense with it being a sequel.  The sequel you can play on 3DS or Vita.
I absolutely love Umineko: When They Cry. It's a visual novel in which 18 people gather on an island to decide how to divide up the family inheritance, and people start dying mysteriously one by one. It's about as far from generic as you can get, however, as the question about whether or not there are supernatural elements at play becomes more central than the murders themselves.

It's an incredibly long game, but the amount of time is well worth it. Nearly every character in the huge cast is very well-developed, and the murders become convoluted and difficult but solvable puzzles spanning multiple hours. Also, the [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAKkw71ff3U) is killer.
    It should be noted that this is a kinetic visual novel that is almost 100 hours long, coverted into book form it is almost 3300 pages. Aside from a brief, amazing minigame there are almost no choices at all to speak of, the number of choices is [spoiler](#s "one") the VN is not like Phoenix Wright and has no dialogue options or movement. It reads exactly like a book.

It is, however, one of the best and highest rated VNs ever written. I am not one for hyperbole and can say that Umineko, even years later, changed the way I view human beings to a more positive experience and got me back into reading books for pleasure. If I could choose one thing that every person on the planet read this would probably be it. Everyone I know that has read it has emerged a much happier person for it.
        Do you know if anybody's translated it to English?  Even a fan translation?  

I've been trying to track find it for a bit, but I'm not sure where to look.
            It has been fully translated by fans into english. There's a ps3 sprites plus voices version, that's the one you want, the translation is professional quality and a team did it.
                Alright!  Thank you very much!

Yeah, I've been trying to get into some VNs for awhile, especially if I liked the premise, but didn't like their adaptations *cough*Tsukihime*cough*.

Hopefully, with the push for VNs on Steam, we'll start seeing more and more come over.  Preferably uncensored, but it probably wouldn't be hard to find fan patches.
                    Any VN coming out on Steam has an uncensored English release.    Nekopara and Eden are available on Denpasoft and Mangagamer for their 18+ versions. Grisaia is likely gonna be on Denpasoft too.

Don't be afraid to head over to /r/visualnovels,  we're nice I promise ahaha
                        Huh, I was under the impression that a few of Steam's VNs were censored a bit.  I guess I was wrong, I haven't actually had the time to try them.

I know of Mangagamer, but not Denpasoft.  And I'll be sure to check the subreddit out!
                            Steams VNs are censored. But you can buy uncensored English versions of any censored VN on steam. Does that make sense? So Sekai Project releases their VNs that they translate on steam. Denpasoft is Sekai Projects site for their adult stuff. 
                                Oh, gotcha.  Yeah, I'm a bit out of it today, that makes a lot more sense.
            I can PM you a link if you want.
                Please do. 
                I would really appreciate it.  Thank you.
By far the best I've ever played is deadly premonition. If you can get past the hideous graphics, the terrible driving, and the horrendous shooting (which only do a limited amount of times anyways) then you will be in for one of the best mystery games ever made with a often hilarious and thought provoking story that makes you feel like you're actually solving something instead of just being dragged along.
If you liked Crimes & Punishment, I recommend you pickup Sherlock Holmes Vs. Jack the Ripper.  
It's a bit old and has relatively bad graphics but the dark atmosphere and story make up for it.  
  
I think the only murder mystery games I played were Sherlock Holmes games, that's why I hope Frogwares studio keeps making them.  
  
They are very rich in creepiness and have some pretty good puzzles (although sometimes frustrating) *and* you get to play as Sherlock Holmes!
Someone has already mentioned Dangan Ronpa.

Wow what a ride. Its chock full of mystery, you have no idea where you are or who the people around you are or whether you can trust them. Slowly you are stuck in a game where people get murdered and its up to you find out who in each instance or die trying. Twists galore and great story to tie all the other sub stories together.
    I'm on Dangan Ronpa 2 and I couldn't agree more. It's a game that encourages you to make friends without knowing who will die or who will kill next, so you're left with that sense of "do I dare become friends with this person knowing they could be dead by tomorrow?" Also, the game lets you choose a difficulty level, so whether you want it to hold your hand through the murder mystery or put together all the pieces by yourself, you'll get the experience you want.
        > or put together all the pieces by yourself, you'll get the experience you want.

That's interesting. What happens if you fail to put the pieces togheter? Do you just get to try again?
            Pretty much. The "trial sequences" when you take the evidence and find the killer, incorporate a number of action sequences where you contradict testimony with evidence, assemble a timeline of the murder, or make logical conclusions, rely upon a sort of health bar that represents everyone's trust in you to get it right. If that drops to zero, you restart at the beginning of the sequence. In theory, you could randomly guess at everything, but that wouldn't be very fun (and isn't that necessary, as you should have things at least somewhat figured out).
    Can anyone help me out? Dangan ronpa's wiki says it was released on iOS in 2012, but i can't find it in the app store. Anyone know what happened to it?
        It was released on iOS in Japan only. Only the Vita version has been released in the west. 
            Ah, that explains it. Thanks for the answer!
        Danganronpa 1 on the original PSP has a full fan-translated English patch, and can be emulated on PPSSPP as well. 
    [removed]
        I have a similar opinion as well. I'm not a big fan of anime, and never have been, for those same cliches. Playing trough that game I found myself rolling my eyes multiple times. I don't know if it's satire or intentional but either way it's plain silly.
Would Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers qualify? Because that game is fuckin' awesome.
Heavy Rain is a fantastic murder mystery game. Really, really heavy on the character development. Replay value is limited, but it's the best at what it does.

The same development team also made Indigo Prophecy. That game fizzles in the second half, but the beginning of that game is just amazingly good. 

    Heavy rain is terrible. The twist is bad, the voice acting is horrible. The way Ethan is connected to the killer was taken out of the game so it doesn't make sense. The kids do not act like kids, they act like two year olds with how they think. Chase scenes were just stupid, like when chasing after a suspect and you run through a market. Traits were set up only to be ignored in scenes because it would interfere with the scene. 

seriously, the voices are horrid. Especially the children voices.

If I have to take pity on David Cage's weak game, I'll at least say that your choices do impact the ending, slightly.
        And this shit's just the tip of the iceberg. One of the big things that got talked about with the game was how you shouldn't replay it. It turns out, the real reason they don't want you to replay it is because if you do then nothing makes sense at all. If you start to question certain things the entire plot falls apart. Just like any David Cage game!
        I can never get these points across whenever I talk to people who love Heavy Rain.  They just don't get it.

Look, I don't care if someone likes the story.  It has some merits.  But I'm not afraid to say it is objectively bad.  I don't use "objectively" a lot, but it's honestly the case here.  So many plotholes.  Poor pacing.  Random psychotic characters appear, and then are no longer heard from again.  The police in this game's universe are complete idiots, for the convenience of keeping the story going.

And worse of all, the storytelling is so manipulative, it's offensive.  Case in point: There's a playable character that manages to do something "off-screen", without the player knowing, even though they're controlling them.  How the fuck does that happen?  Who thought that was a good idea?

Most games have gameplay to stand it back up if the story fails, but in Heavy Rain's case, it's about the story.  The gameplay serves the story.  So since it's bad, it just fails as a game.

So yes, you (not "you" as in who I'm replying to, but anyone) can like the story.  But please don't say it's a good story.  It just isn't.
        The thing that really made me mad about the twist was that there was a much better candidate for the killer.  The psychiatrist that we see in the beginning, treating Ethan with some kind of virtual reality device would have been perfect and could easily explain the connection between Ethan and the killer.  He's also the one who implicates Ethan to the cops.

Instead we got a cheap reveal made worse by the fact that we had already been inside the characters head.  There wasn't even an easy explanation of a split personality disorder, instead it was just "nope, he was crazy all along, you just never noticed."

Like all of Cage's scripts there was so much wasted potential.  I really hope in further games he steps back into a story supervisor role and lets a more competent writer handle the meat of the project.
    It is amazing. It got me attached to the controller more than many shooters or adventure games. Fantastic atmosphere, great story, interesting characters and set pieces. Highly recommend it. The only reason why I think you might not like it is because it is hard to determine who the killer is until it is revealed in-game. You will spend time guessing at most.

About the plotholes - you will find them in just about every crime movie or book and they are often worse than they are in Heavy Rain. It is just that this game got so much praise and was so popular that people went out of their ways to criticize it.
        Just because a lot of crime fiction has plot holes doesn't mean it's OK for Heavy Rain to have plot holes. And even the lousiest mystery doesn't just straight up lie to the reader. That is 100% breaking the rules.

[Heavy Rain Spoiler](#s "When Shelby's in the clock shop, you control him as he walks in on the owner's body and the phone off the hook to 911, but it's revealed later that he actually walked in, killed the guy, called 911, and then acted like he just walked in on it. That's bullshit. You can't do that unless you're using Shelby as the unreliable narrator, which doesn't work because the game's in 3rd person.")

That said, Heavy Rain has probably my favorite implementation of QTEs ever, and it still looks pretty good, all things considered. But between the all-around terrible francophone English cast and the (IMO) completely botched mystery plot, I can't recommend it. I will say I like it much better than Beyond: Two Souls and Indigo Prophecy.
            Suit yourself, I am absolutely buying the next Quantic Dream game and hope they make something similar.
I think Ghost Trick is the best. It's really good how it starts off as you, a ghost, trying to find your own killer, and develops are you learn more and more about the bigger picture, introducing more characters and loads of shocking plot twists, none of which feel out of place. It's just great.

And then there's the obligatory plug for Ace Attorney. I really enjoyed the murder mystery aspects of Persona 4, as well. It's another one where all the characters are very fleshed out and discovering the truth behind the killings is a deeper rabbit hole than it first seems.
*sigh*. Ok, I'm going to name a game series that will immediately turn you off but bear with me.

Nancy Drew.

Seriously, the Nancy Drew series of games have been my guilty pleasure for "best game I don't want other men to know I like" for quite some time.  Not every game in the series is going great, but the characters, environments, voice acting, and puzzles are just strong enough to make the series worthwhile.

For those who don't know Nancy Drew games are sort of a first person point-and-click adventure game where you navigate around environments, collect clues, interview and talk to people, and solve puzzles.  (kind of like myst but with people). They are almost never reviewed by gaming sites despite being, in my opinion, a perfectly reasonable and fun set of mystery games.  I would recommend Danger on Deception Island and Curse of Blackmoore Manor if you are new and want to give them a shot.  They are usually on sale via steam.

    I have to say my favourite one in the series has to be Shadow at the Water's edge for it's atmosphere and the puzzles that seem to really fit in.
        Fuck that frame puzzle though, holy shit took like an hour for me and my sister to do
A really cool one is [The Colonel's Bequest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colonel%27s_Bequest). Its a Sierra adventure game where you run around a Southern plantation and try to solve an on-going murder mystery. As you play, you attempt to solve puzzles and learn more about the characters to try and find out what's really going on. An interesting element is that witnessing certain events will "progress time" in the story, meaning you can miss a lot of the game or leave puzzles unsolved. 
    This was one of the first adventure games I ever played, and loved it. Do you know if there's any place to legally get this game now?
        No, I don't know about that. Sorry :(
        I had a quick look on Google and it's listed on a few abandonware websites, I don't know if that means it's officially free now? 
The raven: legacy of master thief is a very enjoyable puzzle/mystery game if you can get over the wonky controls in a few locations. It's a very good homage to Agatha Christie, complete with a character that is an homage to Christie herself.

E. Fixed spelling errors
I enjoyed [Sinking Island](http://store.steampowered.com/app/333430/). The "mixed" status seems to be because of a crash bug that appears to be fixed now. There aren't many reviews on Steam, but you can find some if you google.

I liked the atmosphere, setting and story when I played several years ago
If you don't mind older adventure games, The Last Express is a really great mystery and a unique classic-style point and click from 1997. It tries to simulate real time over a three-day train ride as well as using dynamic AI in a way that was ahead of its time, and the actors in it are rotoscoped rather than using FMV, which gives it an interesting look.
You should definitely play the five Blackwell games and The Shivah, both from Wadjet Eye Games and now currently on sale on Steam. 

The Blackwell games are mysteries with a twist, in that you play a medium who can see ghosts and you are trying to figure out what is it about their deaths that is keeping them stuck here so that you can help them move on to the afterlife. (Usually murder.)

In The Shivah you play a rabbi who's finds out a former parishioner of his who's been murdered has bequeathed him money in his will and decides to figure out what the hell is going on. 

These games' strong suit are the extremely logical, immersive puzzles that make you feel like you're a detective solving a crime, instead of some asshole wrestling with wacky adventure game puzzles. I highly recommend them.
Haven't played them but [Murdered: Soul Suspect](http://store.steampowered.com/app/233290/) & [The Vanishing of Ethan Carter](http://store.steampowered.com/app/258520/) look like murder mystery games. Don't quote me on that though. 
    Vanishing of Ethan Carter is more an adventure game than a murder mystery. The puzzles all follow a formula and can be solved with guesswork. 
    I liked Soul Suspect but it does play like a game from a decade ago. The story is interesting and the game isn't too long that you get bored. It has mini mysteries to investigate as well as the main mystery and you use your 'ghost tricks' to solve the mystery. I think some more time could have been put into the implementation but it is a solid title if you can get it at sale price.

Ghost Trick is pretty much the same premise for the DS. There is no action sequences and it is all about using your 'ghost tricks' to solve the mystery of your murder and prevent others from being murdered. The animation is the best there is on the DS and the story is solid and humorous.
        Yeah i found Mudered to be not as bad as everyone said it was. Quite enjoyed it honestly! 
            It is good, but only if you pay no more than $15 for it.  

It's unfortunate, but Murdered is the quintessential middle tier game.  Perfectly enjoyable to play with solid mechanics and story, but not worthy of full retail price for the consumer.

The market is more saturated with "good games" now than ever.  Murdered just ends up lost in the shuffle.
I'm not going to describe it as 'the best' or 'a favourite', but I feel like I need to sneak in a reference to an indie title I thought had some very interesting ideas. With a bit more time and budget the concept could have been incredible.

Noir Syndrome is a very basic indie murder mystery game where you collect randomly generated, very, very simplistic clues that narrow down a small number of factors (mafia/law/neutral affiliation, job, etc) to help you narrow down the list of suspects in a murder investigation. By making it procedurally generated rather than a pre-scripted scenario, it actually does force you to use some easily understandable logic to reason out the murderer, rather than follow potentially labyrinthine pre-written clues.

This gives it both some strengths (potentially infinite replayability and a feeling of accomplishment when you solve the crime) and some weaknesses (naturally weaker stories and unpredictability). It's an interesting idea I think needs to be explored in a larger game. Mix it in with something like the Nemesis system from SoM and you could have a genuinely interesting procedurally generated murder mystery game.
    NS I thought was a very cool game once.  Then it is just kinda meh with repeat replays.
I enjoyed playing [Deja Vu](http://www.destructoid.com/games-time-forgot-deja-vu-132419.phtml) as a kid, but I never beat it.
[*Atticus VII*](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&uid=11045) is a recent short Ludum Dare game. You play as an AI on a ship where a murder happened. You have to listen in on conversations, talk to characters, find the murderer and ensure that the ship arrives safely.
Not exactly a "murder mystery" but there are certainly many mysteries in the Corpse Party VN series, and many *many* murders. Definitely worth it if you're into horror and can get past the cutesy anime visuals. The audio and voice acting in the PSP games are superb. 
Deja Vu was cool http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_Vu_%28video_game%29

You wake up in a bathroom stall not knowing who you are. Needed some creative thinking
Persona 4 has it as a sort of backdrop, but it's always the motivation. Unfortunately the deduction basically comes down to one decision. At the end. 
Those who like danganropa may also like Persona 4, a JRPG spinoff of shin megami tensei, I'm which there's a supernatural murder mystery going on on a small town. It's a good game for those who like RPG conventions and social situations.
Well if you like detective games, don't mind dated gameplay or graphics and have a good sense of humor then the Tex Murphy series is always good.  While the games today look (very) dated, the games themselves were always a good satire of detective stories.  I'd start with Under a Killing Moon and the Pandora Directive before moving on to the modern Tesla Effect.
Not to be "that" guy, but his name is Rube Goldberg, not Rude :P
    Fuck. Thanks. 
Ghost Trick is my #1 game for DS. I haven't enjoyed any game more in the library more than I enjoyed GT. I 100% recommend it to anyone that has a DS or can get it on iOS.

The one flaw that I have with it is that I think it holds your hand far too much. Like, it has some sort of 'tutorial' from beggining to end... And I really hope a sequel comes out some day, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.

I just checked and unfortunately it's not on the Android app store so if you don't have an apple device you'll have to hunt down one of the increasingly rare and valuable cartridges. 

On another note definitely check out Layton Brothers: Mystery Room for your purest murder mystery game. As far as I know it's only on ios though. But it's dirt cheap and the first episode is free. Made by the same people who give you professor Layton. 
    I thoroughly enjoyed Layton Brothers, but I found that around the final chapter or so I was falling into the old pattern of "TRY EVERYTHING WITH EVERYTHING" that the Phoenix Wright games have a bad habit of doing.
ghost trick is amazing. ios port is great, get that
I loved Ghost Trick, but I wouldn't really classify it as a "murder mystery" like many of the other games since figuring out whodunnit isn't really a primary objective of the game as you point out (after all the protagonist doesn't really care). That being said it's still an amazing game and I agree with your recommendation wholeheartedly.
I cannot recommend this game enough. I really like Phoenix Wright, it's one of my favourite series in fact, but this game just blows it out of the water story-wise.

In gameplay it's very different from the usual visual novel. It's not based on choices or linguistic trickery like in PW, but rather on traditional puzzle design. But the story... oh man the story. It's simply said amazing. The twist and turns this game features are unlike anything I've seen before and even though I managed to predict one of the big reveals in the game, actually being right and realizing all the foreshadowing was stunning.

The peculiar premise that sets it apart from other games also differs from the traditional murder mystery, however, in the sense that you're not solving other murders, but rather your own. You start the game as an amnesiac ghost trying to find out his identity, history and murderer, while preventing deaths during the actual game.

This is one of the only games that, when I finished it, made me feel sad that the story was over. I had grown so attached to the characters and knowing that the story had been beautifully resolved and that there (probably) won't be a sequel was enough to keep me from playing other games for a couple of days.

Definitely one of the best DS games. Would certainly recommend.

It also helps that the music was made by the composer of the PW games and is, thus, godly.
To add to this: Ghost Trick is written by Shu Takumi. The same guy who created Ace Attorney.
Yep. The big three in my mind are Phoenix Wright, DanganRonpa, and 999/Virtue's Last Reward.

Phoenix Wright alone has 5 base games and two spinoff games (Edgeworth series), each with 4-5 murder cases. The first three tie so well together though, that the climax of game 3's final case makes the series the best i've ever played.
    anyone who likes these games should honestly give umineko a try. It my favorite of the genre.
        Umineko is really really really meta (though still an incredible piece of fiction). Higurashi is a lot more "traditional" (and a lot more horror focused).
            Was planing on playing umineko soon as I enjoyed the higurashi anime(and  i am waiting on the steam release of the game) anything I need to know going in other then the fact the translation might not be the best?
                The translation is pretty rock solid. There's a patch that updates the sprites/art and adds voice acting (ripped from the PS3 version). It's really nice.
                    That is good to know think i'm going to play it after world end economica ep 1 as I picked that up during the steam auction
    I started 999 and it was very interesting but after about 2:30 hours my DS froze and I lost my savefile for some fucking reason. Too lazy to start over, but everytime I see the game's name I get reminded of how much I missed out on.
        You should definitely play it, it's worth the same.
        Considering you need to play the game at least 5 or 6 times to get the true ending, starting over is something you should be planning on doing with it. ;)

It's very worth it, I'd definitely say to try it again.
        I got hit by that twice. Just never save when you're in a puzzle room.
            OHHHH, that's probably what caused it. Pretty sure it froze while saving and I was booting up the DS thinking 'please don't erase my progress'
    Game 3 Case 5 is easily my favorite of the series. The only thing that really comes close is the second Edgeworth game.
Before *Phoenix Wright* there was a 90s FMV game with the same premise called *In the First Degree*. Never played it, but it got good reviews at the time. I wonder if it's worth checking out.
This sounds interesting. How does it incorporate multiple players? You know what I'll just look it up myself. Thanks. 
    [Here](http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/blog/post/review-sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective/) is the review that made the game sell out overnight and get a modern reprint.
It should be noted that this is a kinetic visual novel that is almost 100 hours long, coverted into book form it is almost 3300 pages. Aside from a brief, amazing minigame there are almost no choices at all to speak of, the number of choices is [spoiler](#s "one") the VN is not like Phoenix Wright and has no dialogue options or movement. It reads exactly like a book.

It is, however, one of the best and highest rated VNs ever written. I am not one for hyperbole and can say that Umineko, even years later, changed the way I view human beings to a more positive experience and got me back into reading books for pleasure. If I could choose one thing that every person on the planet read this would probably be it. Everyone I know that has read it has emerged a much happier person for it.
    Do you know if anybody's translated it to English?  Even a fan translation?  

I've been trying to track find it for a bit, but I'm not sure where to look.
        It has been fully translated by fans into english. There's a ps3 sprites plus voices version, that's the one you want, the translation is professional quality and a team did it.
            Alright!  Thank you very much!

Yeah, I've been trying to get into some VNs for awhile, especially if I liked the premise, but didn't like their adaptations *cough*Tsukihime*cough*.

Hopefully, with the push for VNs on Steam, we'll start seeing more and more come over.  Preferably uncensored, but it probably wouldn't be hard to find fan patches.
                Any VN coming out on Steam has an uncensored English release.    Nekopara and Eden are available on Denpasoft and Mangagamer for their 18+ versions. Grisaia is likely gonna be on Denpasoft too.

Don't be afraid to head over to /r/visualnovels,  we're nice I promise ahaha
                    Huh, I was under the impression that a few of Steam's VNs were censored a bit.  I guess I was wrong, I haven't actually had the time to try them.

I know of Mangagamer, but not Denpasoft.  And I'll be sure to check the subreddit out!
                        Steams VNs are censored. But you can buy uncensored English versions of any censored VN on steam. Does that make sense? So Sekai Project releases their VNs that they translate on steam. Denpasoft is Sekai Projects site for their adult stuff. 
                            Oh, gotcha.  Yeah, I'm a bit out of it today, that makes a lot more sense.
        I can PM you a link if you want.
            Please do. 
            I would really appreciate it.  Thank you.
I'm on Dangan Ronpa 2 and I couldn't agree more. It's a game that encourages you to make friends without knowing who will die or who will kill next, so you're left with that sense of "do I dare become friends with this person knowing they could be dead by tomorrow?" Also, the game lets you choose a difficulty level, so whether you want it to hold your hand through the murder mystery or put together all the pieces by yourself, you'll get the experience you want.
    > or put together all the pieces by yourself, you'll get the experience you want.

That's interesting. What happens if you fail to put the pieces togheter? Do you just get to try again?
        Pretty much. The "trial sequences" when you take the evidence and find the killer, incorporate a number of action sequences where you contradict testimony with evidence, assemble a timeline of the murder, or make logical conclusions, rely upon a sort of health bar that represents everyone's trust in you to get it right. If that drops to zero, you restart at the beginning of the sequence. In theory, you could randomly guess at everything, but that wouldn't be very fun (and isn't that necessary, as you should have things at least somewhat figured out).
Can anyone help me out? Dangan ronpa's wiki says it was released on iOS in 2012, but i can't find it in the app store. Anyone know what happened to it?
    It was released on iOS in Japan only. Only the Vita version has been released in the west. 
        Ah, that explains it. Thanks for the answer!
    Danganronpa 1 on the original PSP has a full fan-translated English patch, and can be emulated on PPSSPP as well. 
[removed]
    I have a similar opinion as well. I'm not a big fan of anime, and never have been, for those same cliches. Playing trough that game I found myself rolling my eyes multiple times. I don't know if it's satire or intentional but either way it's plain silly.
Heavy rain is terrible. The twist is bad, the voice acting is horrible. The way Ethan is connected to the killer was taken out of the game so it doesn't make sense. The kids do not act like kids, they act like two year olds with how they think. Chase scenes were just stupid, like when chasing after a suspect and you run through a market. Traits were set up only to be ignored in scenes because it would interfere with the scene. 

seriously, the voices are horrid. Especially the children voices.

If I have to take pity on David Cage's weak game, I'll at least say that your choices do impact the ending, slightly.
    And this shit's just the tip of the iceberg. One of the big things that got talked about with the game was how you shouldn't replay it. It turns out, the real reason they don't want you to replay it is because if you do then nothing makes sense at all. If you start to question certain things the entire plot falls apart. Just like any David Cage game!
    I can never get these points across whenever I talk to people who love Heavy Rain.  They just don't get it.

Look, I don't care if someone likes the story.  It has some merits.  But I'm not afraid to say it is objectively bad.  I don't use "objectively" a lot, but it's honestly the case here.  So many plotholes.  Poor pacing.  Random psychotic characters appear, and then are no longer heard from again.  The police in this game's universe are complete idiots, for the convenience of keeping the story going.

And worse of all, the storytelling is so manipulative, it's offensive.  Case in point: There's a playable character that manages to do something "off-screen", without the player knowing, even though they're controlling them.  How the fuck does that happen?  Who thought that was a good idea?

Most games have gameplay to stand it back up if the story fails, but in Heavy Rain's case, it's about the story.  The gameplay serves the story.  So since it's bad, it just fails as a game.

So yes, you (not "you" as in who I'm replying to, but anyone) can like the story.  But please don't say it's a good story.  It just isn't.
    The thing that really made me mad about the twist was that there was a much better candidate for the killer.  The psychiatrist that we see in the beginning, treating Ethan with some kind of virtual reality device would have been perfect and could easily explain the connection between Ethan and the killer.  He's also the one who implicates Ethan to the cops.

Instead we got a cheap reveal made worse by the fact that we had already been inside the characters head.  There wasn't even an easy explanation of a split personality disorder, instead it was just "nope, he was crazy all along, you just never noticed."

Like all of Cage's scripts there was so much wasted potential.  I really hope in further games he steps back into a story supervisor role and lets a more competent writer handle the meat of the project.
It is amazing. It got me attached to the controller more than many shooters or adventure games. Fantastic atmosphere, great story, interesting characters and set pieces. Highly recommend it. The only reason why I think you might not like it is because it is hard to determine who the killer is until it is revealed in-game. You will spend time guessing at most.

About the plotholes - you will find them in just about every crime movie or book and they are often worse than they are in Heavy Rain. It is just that this game got so much praise and was so popular that people went out of their ways to criticize it.
    Just because a lot of crime fiction has plot holes doesn't mean it's OK for Heavy Rain to have plot holes. And even the lousiest mystery doesn't just straight up lie to the reader. That is 100% breaking the rules.

[Heavy Rain Spoiler](#s "When Shelby's in the clock shop, you control him as he walks in on the owner's body and the phone off the hook to 911, but it's revealed later that he actually walked in, killed the guy, called 911, and then acted like he just walked in on it. That's bullshit. You can't do that unless you're using Shelby as the unreliable narrator, which doesn't work because the game's in 3rd person.")

That said, Heavy Rain has probably my favorite implementation of QTEs ever, and it still looks pretty good, all things considered. But between the all-around terrible francophone English cast and the (IMO) completely botched mystery plot, I can't recommend it. I will say I like it much better than Beyond: Two Souls and Indigo Prophecy.
        Suit yourself, I am absolutely buying the next Quantic Dream game and hope they make something similar.
I have to say my favourite one in the series has to be Shadow at the Water's edge for it's atmosphere and the puzzles that seem to really fit in.
    Fuck that frame puzzle though, holy shit took like an hour for me and my sister to do
This was one of the first adventure games I ever played, and loved it. Do you know if there's any place to legally get this game now?
    No, I don't know about that. Sorry :(
    I had a quick look on Google and it's listed on a few abandonware websites, I don't know if that means it's officially free now? 
Vanishing of Ethan Carter is more an adventure game than a murder mystery. The puzzles all follow a formula and can be solved with guesswork. 
I liked Soul Suspect but it does play like a game from a decade ago. The story is interesting and the game isn't too long that you get bored. It has mini mysteries to investigate as well as the main mystery and you use your 'ghost tricks' to solve the mystery. I think some more time could have been put into the implementation but it is a solid title if you can get it at sale price.

Ghost Trick is pretty much the same premise for the DS. There is no action sequences and it is all about using your 'ghost tricks' to solve the mystery of your murder and prevent others from being murdered. The animation is the best there is on the DS and the story is solid and humorous.
    Yeah i found Mudered to be not as bad as everyone said it was. Quite enjoyed it honestly! 
        It is good, but only if you pay no more than $15 for it.  

It's unfortunate, but Murdered is the quintessential middle tier game.  Perfectly enjoyable to play with solid mechanics and story, but not worthy of full retail price for the consumer.

The market is more saturated with "good games" now than ever.  Murdered just ends up lost in the shuffle.
NS I thought was a very cool game once.  Then it is just kinda meh with repeat replays.
Fuck. Thanks. 
I thoroughly enjoyed Layton Brothers, but I found that around the final chapter or so I was falling into the old pattern of "TRY EVERYTHING WITH EVERYTHING" that the Phoenix Wright games have a bad habit of doing.
anyone who likes these games should honestly give umineko a try. It my favorite of the genre.
    Umineko is really really really meta (though still an incredible piece of fiction). Higurashi is a lot more "traditional" (and a lot more horror focused).

I know of Mangagamer, but not Denpasoft.  And I'll be sure to check the subreddit out!
    Steams VNs are censored. But you can buy uncensored English versions of any censored VN on steam. Does that make sense? So Sekai Project releases their VNs that they translate on steam. Denpasoft is Sekai Projects site for their adult stuff. 
        Oh, gotcha.  Yeah, I'm a bit out of it today, that makes a lot more sense.
