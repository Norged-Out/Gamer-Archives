[[Based on a comment i saw]]





People have explained to me 3 times what gyatt and rizzler means and I'm still very confused
    I'm like 90% sure gyatt is to say someone has a big ass and rizz/rizzler involves someone's ability to flirt.
        Yeah rizz comes from charisma
        ur right. I say this as a person part of gen z lol
        I thought Gyatt meant pretty
            You're so gyatt ohmigosh!!!!!!!! ^ -^
                what amazing gyatt you have!! ><
                DO NOT
                    WAAAAaa am too gyatty to be yelled at T^ T
                        ABSOLUTELY DO NOT
                            DONT SCREAM AT MEEEEEEE I DONT LOOK AS GYATT WHILE CRYINGGGG!!
                                DO NOT WHAT SO EVER

    Gyatt originally comes from "god damn!" At seeing a nice ass. A bit of aave vernacularization over time, "goddamn" "gyaadam" "gyatt damn" to just "gyatt" to refer to a nice butt.
        I thought it was a acronym for "Get your act together." I don't understand slang anymore
            It is, yet I've also heard it can stand for "girl your ass thick" in this new age... 

I know *I* won't ever use it for that, at least.
                Me neither, plus I'm pretty sure I'll *never* truly understand the slang on this generation
        Oh, that does make more sense. It thought its origin to be the turkish language, as "göt" means ass in turkish.
    This shit rlly makes me feel like a boomer and I just turned 18 ong
Shuichi: No, you know what? How about I just call Maki, after all she's the Ultimate Child Caregiver so she's gonna give ALOT of care to you.

Kokichi: wait don't-

*and so Kokichi was never able to walk again.*
    He can't stick his gyatt out for the rizzler again....................
        He can’t be skibidi..
            How will he pay his fanum tax
                He will never be a sigma
                    He'll never visit Ohio again either
                        And he can’t Yes Yes again
    No more skibiding for him
        unskibidiable
    She just chops his legs off.
Well, >!being slowly crushed to death by a hydraulic press has gotta hurt.!<
    The gyatt was first to go *pop*

The word rizzler is now starting to sound like some cryptid bitch like slenderman
    It comes to your room at night to whisper into your ear about the women it's been with
Shuichi probably wouldnt say this, but

*I agree*
Canon
Ah yes, I know what comment you were basing this on

Does anyone actually know what skibidi means?
    ~~It's a meme that comes from a song called something like "Skibidi dip dop"~~


It's Toilet Language for "Give me your Ohio".
        How have we fallen Off this much already?
Now I want to see the comment anyways Shuichi my beloved
You're so skibidi m, you're so kokichi
Very accurate
Kill him.
Oh no, Kokichi has genZ-itis
    WOAH WOAH WOAH. Gen Z has NOTHING to do with the skibidi-gyatt-rizzler-fanum tax kids. That is Gen ALPHA. That is an important distinction
        Sorry, it's getting so confusing with so many gens. I don't even know where they start and begin. 😭
If Danganronpa V3 had another ending be like
