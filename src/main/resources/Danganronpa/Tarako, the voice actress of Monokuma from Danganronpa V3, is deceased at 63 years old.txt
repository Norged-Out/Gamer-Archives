[[Tarako, the voice actress of Monokuma from Danganronpa V3, is deceased at 63 years old]]





Tarako’s death was announced about a day after the announcement of Toriyama’s death. March 2024 sucks.
    TORIYAMA'S DEAD!?!?
        yeah, he died on the 1st but made it public last night
        Yup. Never was a fan of Dragon Ball, personally, but you still hate to see it. That man made Shonen what it is today
            same
            I used to love Dragon Ball, so this is sad for me. Rip to him as well

        yeap 01 March 2024
    I literally woke up today to find that Akira Toriyama had passed away.

And now Tarako's gone too.

No wonder I'm feeling miserable.
        First my dog, then the Backyardigans creator, then Toriyama, now Monokuma. This month is off to a miserable start.
            I'm sorry for your loss.
    And earlier Janice Burgess the creator the Backyardigans also died. A sad month so far.
    March 2024 very sad
    The hit’s just keep coming 😢 

Pu-pu-pu-pu in peace, Tarako-san.
Man.... Not only I got to know today that Toriyama died but Monokuma's VA as well? Today's not a good day.

With that said, I pay her huge respect for how she voiced Monokuma. May she live an amazing after life.
Lost Akira Toriyama on the 1st, lost this queen today... I truly cannot believe my eyes anymore. What is happening...? 💔
"The cause of Tarako's passing has yet to be revealed, but last summer, the voice actor was a part of an interview where she discussed her death. Here's what Tarako had to say in 2023 about her mortality, "I'm no longer afraid of death. When I go to heaven, I'll be able to see my parents, my dog, and my cat." " 

I bet she's so happy to see everyone again
ご冥福をお祈りします
    You know. That actually helps a bit. Knowing that she was likely at peace when she passed.
        I remember this interview, or at least I remember the quote, such a beautiful declaration
Holy fuck, this year is gonna kill me. Only 3 months in.

She was also Chibi Maruko-chan, which is a long running anime still running to this day... Unless they stop it due to this, which I wouldn't blame them for.

All on one of my flairs' birthday, no less (in Japan time). Fuck.
May she rest in peace
Rest in peace, Tarako. 

March 2024 really decided to pull no punches.
Monokuma now lost both of his Japanese voices. Ōyama Nobuyo isn’t dead yet, but she’s retired due to dementia and she’s 90 years old.
Bro wtf is happening? First Toriyama, now this? 😭😭😭
Can we STOP losing people this week!? What the actual hell is going on.
 V3 was the first game I ever watched,and I loved her monokuma voice.May she rest in peace
    Same, specifically seeing someone live stream the third class trial on Twitch 4 years ago. Got fully into the franchise from then on.
C'MON, IT'S BEEN JUST 3 MONTHS IN, WTF IS GOING ON WITH THIS YEAR
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING THIS YEAR

My god, that's terrible. May she rest in peace.
Chibi-Maruko was my childhood. Hearing Tarako and Toriyama passing away really hurts my heart 😔 May them rest in peace…
Wow, that’s so shocking. Condolences to her family
Whoever keeps saying it can’t get any worse every New Year’s Eve, SHUT THE FUCKING FUCK UP YOU MOTHERFUCKING MOTHERFUCKER!!!
RIP
this is so heartbreaking- i hope she’s able to rest happily.
Jesus Christ WTF?? I even played the games with the voice lines in Japanese… this makes me so sad :(
we ARE LOOSING EVERYONE DAMMIT
First Toriyama, and now Tarako!?!?
What a shitty day, first toriyama, now her
COME ON 

FUCK MARCH 2024
holy hell, thats the 2nd monokuma voice actor, too...
She played my favourite psycho bear and now she’s GONE?
RIP tarako
Rest in peace. I shall never forget the iconic monokuma Japanese laugh
o7

May she rest in peace
Rest in peace, tarako you will be missed
still far from my favourite Monokuma voice but no doubt a great VA and will be missed
We lost 2 legends this month. 🫡
:(

May she rest in peace.
This Is So Sad ,
Rest in peace miss Tarako. She was amazing voice actress
And for that I have a V3 Monokuma post tonight.
Thank you for bringing to life one of my favorite characters of all time.
Guys we’re not even a week into March… anyway may she rest peacefully
Damn not another one, RIP
NOOOOOO
may she rest in peace...
Rip...
Rest In Peace :(
RIP
Oh god… let’s hope no other voice actors experience this
Rest in piece
this is so sad :(
    she will live forever in our hearts!
Oh, Toriyama and now Tarako, rough start, rip. 

March 2024 has been brutal. 
That is a crazy bad day, Toriyama and Tarako not in this world anymore :(   
may their souls rest in peace
Rest in peace, you made many people so happy with your voice acting and you live on in all of our hearts 🕊️❤️🧸
May she rest in peace. She also played Monokuma in the *Danganronpa 3* anime, and started her career all the way back in 1981.
R.I.P. Just to clarify, this va is only for the V3 Monokuma? Is the VA for Monokuma from Dr 1-2 still alive?
    Just for the game alone yes. Somebody brought up the previous voice actress in another comment.

Not sure about the _DR3 anime_ though.
        Wikipedia says Tarako played Monokuma in both DR3 and V3.
Never heard her voice, but rip
Wow, my brother's birthday has been the ***only*** good thing about March this year, *yay....*

Rest in peace.
Rest in peace 🕊
May she rest in peace
What is going on with this month why are so many people dying
2024 is just fucking Punishment time for Humanity and i HATE it
    Sometimes it really does feel like The Tragedy, doesn't it?
First Toriyama, now Tarako. This shit just ain’t FAIR.
rip
Rest In Peace Tarako
What is going on?? This month just started and 3 loved people died (Janice Burgess, Akira Toriyama and now Tarako), I really hope no more people die...
WHAT? NOW ANOTHER VA IS DYING
This month is a tragedy
She also voiced Zero III in Virtue's Last Reward and Kirara in Inuyasha.
Damn.... Monokuma may have been his worst in v3, but his voice acting wasn't any worse. RIP
she also played monokuma first in danganronpa 3
May she rest in peace.
Didn't know she also voiced the titular character of *Maruko-chan*, where the source material's author also passed away some time back.
this is a depressing month.

may she rest in peace 🙏
RIP
First Toriyama-sensei and now Tarako?! Legend after legend dying, this month is filled with pretty sad news. Rest in peace to both Legends. 😢🫡
さようなら、Tarako.ありがとうございます。私たち全員に喜びをもたらしてくれてありがとうございます。安らかに眠れ、美しい魂よ。またまたまたまたありがとうございます。また。

        WAIT!! NO!!!
    This guy??
        I don't know him, don't be mad, damn
            That's not a guy.
                how was I supposed to know?
                    Simple, look her up on Google.

Well... scroll a bit through the results though, didn't know "Tarako" in Japanese also refers to fish.

Huh, the more you know...
Wtf
Fuck. Can somebody wrap Satoshi Tajiri in a bubble wrap, already?!
TORIYAMA'S DEAD!?!?
    yeah, he died on the 1st but made it public last night
    Yup. Never was a fan of Dragon Ball, personally, but you still hate to see it. That man made Shonen what it is today
        same
        I used to love Dragon Ball, so this is sad for me. Rip to him as well
