Hajime because today I learned he actually canonically says fuck.

…Because of him having great dynamic with his eccentric classmates thanks to his more grounded personality, giving great insights at corrupt structure of HPA and having a lot of bits of subtle characterization that come together neatly to explore his insecurities and desire to be special, also because he is fun to bully.
Gonna go for Saishu here. Makoto is a good character, but as a protag, he's overshadowed by Kyoko way too much. Shuichi is an actual detective, so he ends up solving most of the mysteries, which makes him work a lot better as a protag compared to Makoto. This is probably more Kyoko's fault than Makoto's, as he's a pretty good detective in his own right, but it still did a number on my enjoyment of the first game.
    I think it's because Makoto just focuses on being the heart of the group and getting along with everyone.  
  
Kyoko is a very good detective, but with her social skills to keep order, there would be blood much faster, and everyone would be much more tense.
        Which is exactly the problem. When I play a murder mystery game, I want to solve mysteries. Kyoko solves most of the mysteries, but I'm not playing as Kyoko, I'm playing as Makoto. This is most visible in chap 5, when Kyoko goes off the radar while Makoto stays behind. Kyoko is the one doing the stuff that actually interests me (finding the school's mysteries), but I'm stuck with Makoto who spends 3 days just FTEing everyone still alive. Makoto is a good character, his character development is great, but as a protag, he doesn't work when Kyoko is the one solving most of the mysteries.

> but with her social skills to keep order, there would be blood much faster, and everyone would be much more tense.

Not that Makoto has a better track record here when 60% of the cast ends up dead.
            Colors are broken in tastes. You say "being stuck" with Makoto who spends 3 days hanging out with everyone is actually something bad. I actually feel grateful to be "stuck" with Makoto, because it allows me to relate to and learn more about the colorful characters, deepening my bond.

With someone with a mindset so focused on just solving protagonist mysteries, the first game would feel almost superficial, with the characters only being in the background.

With Makoto, a friend-making protagonist, at least 6 of the 16 contestants survived (Which by the way, DR1 has the record of the game with most survivors).  
  
With Shuichi, a mystery-solving protagonist, 3 of the 16 contestants survived.
                >You say "being stuck" with Makoto who spends 3 days hanging out with everyone is actually something bad.

You misunderstand. The problem isn't that the bonding scenes exist at all, but that they come *at the cost* of the mystery-solving aspect. I like those bonding scenes too, but I paid for a mystery game, not a slice-of-life story. If you take the mystery-solving aspect away, the game suffers. That's one of the main reasons I consider Danganronpa to be the weakest, compared to Zero Escape and Ace Attorney, both of which have colorful casts, but they don't let the mystery aspect suffer for it and both do a great job connecting the characters with the story, without either element suffering.
Hajime. Because he is one of the few characters that actually has a sassy personality and i really like that. His character is one of my favorites(along with kokichi, leon and sakura) and he actually cusses unlike the other protags.





>!also how tf you do not know how many sides an octagon has!<
    >!The Octagon thing was lost through translation. In the Japanese dub, they still use the English word for octagon, so Hajime was asking for clarification since he doesn’t speak English fluently. There probably wasn’t a way to carry over the language discrepancy and have the case still make sense, so they left it as Octagon in the English dub, at the expense of Hajime’s perceived intelligence.!<
        >!oh i see now, thx for clarifying me this 🙂👍!<
        >!Also i said that because in the english dub it sounds like hajime actually doesn't know how many sides an octagon has!<
    Actually Makoto cusses in the game as well, just not as much as Hajime does
        It's been awful long since i finished trigger happy, that's why i didn't remember that.
Kaede is amazing. I had the most enjoyable experience playing as her, and she’s a great fully rounded character with lots of depth. 

However, Hajime has my favourite attitude. And I like his dynamic with the others. I like that he can be a bit of a bitch and actually talks back to people.. Much more preferable than the doormat personalities for me lol (but I love you too Makoto!). I also think his narration is great!
Take a guess
    Spongebob Squarepants
        C o r r e c t
            Ha!
Makoto. I really like how he tried his best to work with his classmates and offering them an olive branch whenever they wronged him, but the moment Monokuma messes with him he doesn't take any of his shit. His maturity and will to move forward is one of his greatest asset as a protag.
I think all of the protagonists are great in their own way and have their strong points.

Makoto and Kaede are amazing beacons of hope and positivity, and the way they all wanted to keep everyone safe was also something I found sweet.

Hajime and Toko/Jack (more Toko tho) were sassy and intelligent characters, and they were funny but also appealing and had great character development.

and finally Komaru and Shuichi were great because of how realistic they were to the situation they were in. Komaru was just a normal girl trapped in such a fucked situation with only a megaphone gun (and Jack) to protect herself, so it made sense that she would cry a lot and be scared. And Shuichi was also great because you can see how stressed he was feeling during the game (especially >!after Kaede died!<)

sorry this is so long LOL but I think they all shine in their own way!
" I am not Izuru Kamukura, I am Hajime Hinata " Wins my heart
Komaru, because she has a human personality.
    I forgot who, but someone said that is why >!Leon was the perfect person to execute first, he was the most human of the characters in the game and people would relate to his personality most!<
Makoto was the most inspiring for me because he was extremely down to earth with nothing that I felt alienated myself from him tho I do wish they also made Junko more believable so that his victory could feel more real, I don't mind the science fiction stuff(they didn't try to surpriseme with that), but found the fate of the world part unnecessary and felt it'd be more meaningful if he were just saving the remaining survivors. Personally it meant a lot to me to see someone remarkably unremarkable persevere with sheer determination (especially because I beat the game around the time I found out I failed every class in my first semester of university) it's also why I don't like how in later entries his luck is treated more like a super power.

Personally Hajime couldn't have the same effect because not only is it not as strong the 2nd time whilst 2 was too similar, but him having a strong ambition is a bit alienating whilst Makoto is more accessible. Although whilst he wasn't a protagonist in 3 I found him a lot more interesting in it and I am a bit of a sucker for heroes that act as the world's villain for the greater good.

Whilst I love Toko comparing her as a protagonist feels weird, tho she was fun to play as, Komaru definitely was a nice change of pace, but it's a bit mean to compare her the same way when her experiences are far from the same, whichI guess you could argue about the rest too, Komaru is definitely less normal than Hajime and Makoto especially given her save spots, I think it would have been cool if like halfway through they let you save anywhere outside of battle implying she started to feel safe around Toko, but they probably thought it'd make things too easy, I do however believe her awkwardness makes her more interesting.

I don't think it's fair to compare Kaede we barely get to see her and even doing all FTEs with her I never got a good feel for her, even over other characters in V3 I felt like we didn't get to know her well.

I also really liked Shuichi's resolve and how his ending broke the pattern whilst I found most others with the exception of DR3 were too similar in ending which made me even more glad they broke the monotony. I also like how you can see in him how badly he feels about the executions specifically when Maki starts giving him trash for it in chapter 5 "why do you keep doing this?" and as she is blaming him for their deaths she knows it is getting to him, he can hardly respond to her, but he has to prove others guilty in order to live and save everyone else too and even tho he spent the past several days just holed up in his room he was still so determined to investigate and do his job.
Hajime is king
I don't consider Kaede or Toko protagonists

Komaru is good but just good 

Hajime is great probably the weakest out of the main series ones because of his lack of interesting dynamics with any characters aside from Nagito

Makoto is better than Hajime because of good character interactions but he's not super interesting

Shuichi is amazing and very well written so he wins
Hajime because he's relatable asf
Hajime. The main character with depth, dimension, and substance. Imma just generalize my comment to avoid spoilers. 🤭
Makoto is a great Protag, he is very reliable, relatable and think rationally.

Kaede is all that, but too selfless.
    When you're so selfless it become a character flaw
        True
    makoto is the best

I guess Ryoko forgot to show up.
    I only used characters the Danganronpa Wiki called "Game Protagonists", so I apologize for missing any other protagonists.
        She’s the protagonist of the novel DR0
            I did not know that. Thanks!
I like Makoto but Shuichi is the most well written
Makoto is just a protagonist done right. 

He's THE protagonist of Danganronpa.
    when you think danganronpa protagonist, you think makoto naegi.
Shuichi has the best writing imo
    also voice acting in a certain  moment of a certain chapter
(SPOILERS) 

Kaede is probably the best one, i like her because they made a really good character just to kill on the beginning of the game, and that is something i find really cool about her and the game in general, the shock of having such a great character dying off so soon is really..... Breathtaking i guess
He's here to punch Komaeda's face and drink orange juice. And he's all out of juice.
Kaede, her "Up and at it positive attitude" is just like mine, regardless if things go wrong she still has pride in herself. And that's important to me.
I love Kaede so much. She was the only protagonist that ever felt like an actual eccentric Danganronpa character and not just a vanilla straight man to contrast with the antics of the actually interesting characters.
I love Hajimemes, but i like kaede more, wonderful protag
I love Hajimemes, but i like kaede more, wonderful protag
hinata because hes so over this shit and also i loved that twist the most out of all the games, felt like it gave his character way more depth n personality than the rest of the protags!
Trying to pick between Shuichi and Kaede is real hard! Komaru as well.
In my opinion all of them except Fukawa
Tojo forever
I only used characters the Danganronpa Wiki called "Game Protagonists" so I apologize if I missed any.
hajime because he is hot, the worst is kaede in my opinion
    Honestly agree. Saihara is emo tho and I gotta respect that.
