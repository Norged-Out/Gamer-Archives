[[We did it iFunny, despair is no more]]





shoutouts to Makoto, Kyoko, and Togami vibing in the back
    U could see them for like a single second xD
    i was literally just about to comment that but i saw this lmfao
    it took me three months to notice this lol
Fitting, since Hajime's VA is also Yu's VA
    Didn’t know that, take my upvote
        He's also Adachi.
            And Rantaro Amami from V:
                Ah yes, my favorite Danganronpa game, V.
                    My bad lol, I’ll leave it up as punishment.
                        Monokuma wants to know your location
    Oh yeah, I forgot that Yu and Adachi share the same VA.  Whenever I hear Hajime, I hear Adachi, but not Yu.
    I can really hear Lelouch when he says allow me to cut through those words or I agree with that, mostly anything he says with confidence, which was how I noticed it was Johnny's voice
        It was easy to identify Johnny when Hajime spoke in a quiet tone, it makes him sound more like Tohru Adachi.
            I actually didn't notice that despite having played P4 and watched the anime in english, but I get that looking back
    Chad playing the chad
    I- no wonder I love them both heres the upvote u deserve
    wow
The secret OVA ending
SDR2 cast ft. Makoto, Kyoko and Byakuya dancing on the rooftop
    Didn't notice until now.
    I’m wondering how much they paid byakuya to do that
        They told him that they would keep Toko away from him
        Do you know that one episode of futurama  when fry becomes a trillion-ere cause he has investments that have existed from 1999 and he was in 3000s so double the triple the amount of 500% of that money + not meeting toko for a a month (it is  pretty expensive but it is worth it) also

 

I know this is irrelevant and I am probably going to get down votes for this but can you guys help me with votes on my DR:rate the case series like seriously I need 40 votes not 9 here is a link for the [2nd discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/kno1mm/drrate_that_case_day_2_case_dr_12_spoilers/) and [the poll](https://www.strawpoll.me/42368202) and here is the link for the [1st discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/kmc322/rate_that_case_day_1_dr_case_11_spoilers/) and note please I am not forcing anyone to help just people who would want to help me if you read this voted or not have a great day and a happy new year
    >!Technically they are part of SDR2 cast.!<
The only people I could see actually dancing like that in game are ibuki, Sonia and kaz
    I can see Chaki doing that while playing dance dance revolution
        Dance dance revolution version of persona 4 dancing
    bro what about nekomaru
        It counts as "exercise". He'll allow it.
    very true but

That's all.
    You're awesome for crediting everyone!! Also hilarious meme thank you for blessing my eyes
        Crediting everyone is actually always a must in the MMD community! If the rules are not kept then the creators will take down their download links. Feel free to remind anyone who is using MMD but forgot to credit to do so~(for everyones benefit)
    Absolutely love this, love seeing animation like this
    Thanks for providing the links! Is there an easy guide on how to make memes like this for people who have no idea how, or will I just have to mess around on my own until I figure it out?
        The basics are easy to learn! Start here: https://learnmmd.com/StartHere/

When uploading what you made with MMD always be sure to credit everything you used (who made the models, motion, camera, stage etc.). Only effects can simply be credited my mentioning their name.
            Thanks my man!
    I love this but I have to mention that it's off sync with the music. It is by about a whole beat so the movements still line up with the music.  Not proud of the time I lost to various versions of this meme
    What program did you use to make this
        MMD, or MikuMikuDance.
    Late response: what is the song called?
>!When the casts of the other 2 games only have a few survivors but your entire cast survives!<
    "cough" Chiaki "cough"
        That's one loose end
        Well, it's not like it hadn't already happened by sdr2...
        Well yes, but actually no
    Wait am I fucking stupid I thought that they couldn’t come back
        The Danganronpa 3 anime retconned it >!so that they all came back safe (except Chiaki).!< I personally am not a fan of it but that’s just how it be.
            It's terribly fanservicey but I actually love it
            I will come back to this one I finish that and killing harmony
DR2 if >!Teruteru had better aim!<
    >!Could you say better timing?!<
    The potential hero of the game that people hate on
    Confused by this, someone throw me an explanation in a spoiler tag if you don’t mind 

I Played the games so that’s why I’d like to know
        >!teru wanted to kill nagito but he couldn’t see the person he was stabbing because he was under the floorboard, and he stabbed Byakuya instead.!< (2-1)
    hilarious but

Ah yes, the specialist meme from Persona 4: dancing
I'm sorry but is that a map from fucking sonic 06? Or am I just hallucinating at 11:47 PM
    I noticed the same thing and am now having war flashbacks.
If Monokuma never showed up:
Hope has never looked so ***F U N K***.

    Super High Level School?
        Super high level school dance instructor
Danganronpa 2: Dancing All Night
How the fuck did makoto, kyoko and byakuya get up there
Even with the sound off I recognized that dance instantly
    [deleted]
        It's specialist from the persona 4 dancing game. If you want to know the original, just go to youtube and search: Persona 4 dancing meme.
I am losing it over Usami dancing
Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair characters when they say goodbye to despair or something, idk I haven't played that game
Specialist!
The VIBES
r/okbuddyronpa

wait I had no idea that sub was real
Fat togami is movin
This is all I wanted for this beautiful people <3
/u/Giulix03 I think I'm gonna propose this to my breakdance course for the next show
I love how this sub is like the little bro of r/persona
 [**u/VredditDownloader**](https://www.reddit.com/user/VredditDownloader/)
This is the biggest vibe
I love how Monomi is dancing with them
AI: the Somnium Files but in Danganronpa
Yes
OMG DESPAIR IS NO MORE GUYS!1!1!!1!1!1!!!!1!1!
#An award I got for free just for you!
That is the weirdest Danganronpa Ending I ever saw
(crying)
Man it's so hard for me to not spend real life money on an award for this right now

    eyy i can practice my japanese reading

*kore wa watashi ga watashinojinsei de mita aka de mottomo geina tawagotodesu!*

which means...

^(ah)
Ah yes, Le Funi Chad Dance from Danganronpa Dancing in Despair
YES  
THE SDR2 CAST DANCING TO SPECIALIST  
AND DANCING YU'S DANCE  
HOW CAN I ASK FOR MORE
Reddit crashed when i opened this post
i see this as an abseloute win
Idk why but this makes me really happy.  Just seeing these characters dance
We did it boys:Despair is no more :D
Everybody! dance! dance!
poker face started playing when I saw this. It’s destiny
take all my upvotes!!!!
Isn't a bit of spoiler Hajime wearing that suit and not his clothes?
u/byzyk
Naegi: Don't mind us, we're just working it on the roof, just-...Aaanndd Togami fell off the roof.
This is excellent
Let’s go, gamers
This is beautiful
This video is a mood
Haha hope go brrr
Omg this is so cool and cute!!
when i say killing is harmonious.
Music from persona 4
[reminds me of that video that one dude uploaded with all those jojo characters](https://youtu.be/spl_-gwHgMk)
So are they making a new season or is it just another video game?
Why is this so good

I haven't played the daganronpa series yet but this makes me want to
r/dangansona
Insert persona 4 joke
killin it
THE PERSONA MUSIC
Nagito be vibin’
The Venn Diagram showing persona fans and Danganronpa fans is practically a circle.
How the heck do you make these!? I want to make one!
    It's a program named MikuMikuDance, it's free and you can download it from this [website](http://learnmmd.com) . I'd recommend you don't go in blind and start [by watching a few tutorials on YouTube ](https://youtu.be/t-kM_TmJwOU) since you can have issue and not understand how to fix them.
usami dancing makes me happy
This is so cursed
damn they got moves
I am a new woman after witnessing this
Can I ask where are the models from?
Thank you
Loving this
You deserve all the upvotes. I LOVE THIS! THANK YOU FOR CREATING THISSSSS!!!
I'm gonna watch this 10 times a day just so it can rack up views
Normal sized Nekomaru D:
Was this made in P4D? How the hell you managed to mod in so much models onto the scene? Or was this just made on PC?
If there's ever DR 2 anime, this should be each episodes' ending.
Monomi though
Brooo you can barely see Teruteru
what is the song
I knew this would become top post. It’s already second.
Imagine Posting A Video Of Danganronpa Characters Dancing And Getting No. 2 Post Of All Time On The Subreddit Within 5 Days Of Posting It
Nagito I love you but please move to the left a little I'm trying to see Gundham
Even on r/Danganronpa you can't escape the Special Edist dance
I love that ine the whole video the only one that has an actual 3d model in the games is byakuya
Ibuki looks at home ding this
Hope
I can’t believe this is the top upvoted of all time
So this is the most upvoted post on all of r/danganronpa

I'm not angry, just disapointed
ive always wondered what this meme format is, ive seen it many times before but idk if it has a name, i mean this program with the dance and song
if you havent notice most of the hair isn't animated so the hardest one to animate is hiyoko cause i see the sleeve of her kimono move .

side note : who wear a kimono that often like that is some high dedecation
 Hajime and Nagito look so happy to be there dancing lol.
Wow, just.... holy hell, this made me wheeze. Take my updoot.

Shoutout to Teruteru still slaying at the back
When Junko said that in Danganronpa 2 I shitted and farted by how impactful that line was
Best game
U could see them for like a single second xD
i was literally just about to comment that but i saw this lmfao
it took me three months to notice this lol
Didn’t know that, take my upvote
    He's also Adachi.
        And Rantaro Amami from V:
            Ah yes, my favorite Danganronpa game, V.
                My bad lol, I’ll leave it up as punishment.
                    Monokuma wants to know your location
Oh yeah, I forgot that Yu and Adachi share the same VA.  Whenever I hear Hajime, I hear Adachi, but not Yu.
I can really hear Lelouch when he says allow me to cut through those words or I agree with that, mostly anything he says with confidence, which was how I noticed it was Johnny's voice
    It was easy to identify Johnny when Hajime spoke in a quiet tone, it makes him sound more like Tohru Adachi.
        I actually didn't notice that despite having played P4 and watched the anime in english, but I get that looking back
Chad playing the chad
I- no wonder I love them both heres the upvote u deserve
wow
Didn't notice until now.
I’m wondering how much they paid byakuya to do that
    They told him that they would keep Toko away from him
    Do you know that one episode of futurama  when fry becomes a trillion-ere cause he has investments that have existed from 1999 and he was in 3000s so double the triple the amount of 500% of that money + not meeting toko for a a month (it is  pretty expensive but it is worth it) also

 

I know this is irrelevant and I am probably going to get down votes for this but can you guys help me with votes on my DR:rate the case series like seriously I need 40 votes not 9 here is a link for the [2nd discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/kno1mm/drrate_that_case_day_2_case_dr_12_spoilers/) and [the poll](https://www.strawpoll.me/42368202) and here is the link for the [1st discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/kmc322/rate_that_case_day_1_dr_case_11_spoilers/) and note please I am not forcing anyone to help just people who would want to help me if you read this voted or not have a great day and a happy new year
>!Technically they are part of SDR2 cast.!<
I can see Chaki doing that while playing dance dance revolution
    Dance dance revolution version of persona 4 dancing
bro what about nekomaru
    It counts as "exercise". He'll allow it.
very true but

You're awesome for crediting everyone!! Also hilarious meme thank you for blessing my eyes
    Crediting everyone is actually always a must in the MMD community! If the rules are not kept then the creators will take down their download links. Feel free to remind anyone who is using MMD but forgot to credit to do so~(for everyones benefit)
Absolutely love this, love seeing animation like this
Thanks for providing the links! Is there an easy guide on how to make memes like this for people who have no idea how, or will I just have to mess around on my own until I figure it out?
    The basics are easy to learn! Start here: https://learnmmd.com/StartHere/

When uploading what you made with MMD always be sure to credit everything you used (who made the models, motion, camera, stage etc.). Only effects can simply be credited my mentioning their name.
        Thanks my man!
I love this but I have to mention that it's off sync with the music. It is by about a whole beat so the movements still line up with the music.  Not proud of the time I lost to various versions of this meme
What program did you use to make this
    MMD, or MikuMikuDance.
Late response: what is the song called?
"cough" Chiaki "cough"
    That's one loose end
    Well, it's not like it hadn't already happened by sdr2...
    Well yes, but actually no
Wait am I fucking stupid I thought that they couldn’t come back
    The Danganronpa 3 anime retconned it >!so that they all came back safe (except Chiaki).!< I personally am not a fan of it but that’s just how it be.
        It's terribly fanservicey but I actually love it
        I will come back to this one I finish that and killing harmony
>!Could you say better timing?!<
The potential hero of the game that people hate on
Confused by this, someone throw me an explanation in a spoiler tag if you don’t mind 

I Played the games so that’s why I’d like to know
    >!teru wanted to kill nagito but he couldn’t see the person he was stabbing because he was under the floorboard, and he stabbed Byakuya instead.!< (2-1)
hilarious but

I noticed the same thing and am now having war flashbacks.
Super High Level School?
    Super high level school dance instructor

    It's specialist from the persona 4 dancing game. If you want to know the original, just go to youtube and search: Persona 4 dancing meme.
eyy i can practice my japanese reading

*kore wa watashi ga watashinojinsei de mita aka de mottomo geina tawagotodesu!*

which means...

^(ah)
It's a program named MikuMikuDance, it's free and you can download it from this [website](http://learnmmd.com) . I'd recommend you don't go in blind and start [by watching a few tutorials on YouTube ](https://youtu.be/t-kM_TmJwOU) since you can have issue and not understand how to fix them.

                Monokuma wants to know your location
It was easy to identify Johnny when Hajime spoke in a quiet tone, it makes him sound more like Tohru Adachi.
    I actually didn't notice that despite having played P4 and watched the anime in english, but I get that looking back
They told him that they would keep Toko away from him
Do you know that one episode of futurama  when fry becomes a trillion-ere cause he has investments that have existed from 1999 and he was in 3000s so double the triple the amount of 500% of that money + not meeting toko for a a month (it is  pretty expensive but it is worth it) also

 

I know this is irrelevant and I am probably going to get down votes for this but can you guys help me with votes on my DR:rate the case series like seriously I need 40 votes not 9 here is a link for the [2nd discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/kno1mm/drrate_that_case_day_2_case_dr_12_spoilers/) and [the poll](https://www.strawpoll.me/42368202) and here is the link for the [1st discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/kmc322/rate_that_case_day_1_dr_case_11_spoilers/) and note please I am not forcing anyone to help just people who would want to help me if you read this voted or not have a great day and a happy new year

Crediting everyone is actually always a must in the MMD community! If the rules are not kept then the creators will take down their download links. Feel free to remind anyone who is using MMD but forgot to credit to do so~(for everyones benefit)
The basics are easy to learn! Start here: https://learnmmd.com/StartHere/

When uploading what you made with MMD always be sure to credit everything you used (who made the models, motion, camera, stage etc.). Only effects can simply be credited my mentioning their name.
    Thanks my man!
