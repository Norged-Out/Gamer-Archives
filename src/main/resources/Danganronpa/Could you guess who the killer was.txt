[[Could you guess who the killer was]]


Chapter 1, I didn't memorize everybody's name yet. With chapter 2, I actually guessed that it was Mondo, for a dumb reason, The killer would've had to lift the dumbbell easily, so I guessed Mondo. Chapter 3, Everybody guessed it was Celest. Chapter 4, I can't say really, it's sorta blurry. Not doing chapter 5 or 6. Second game. Chapter 1, no. Chapter 2, I guessed Fuyuhiko, chapter 3, accidentally had it spoiled, chapter 4, no, chapter 5, nobody guessed Chiaki. Not doing chapter 6 


**DR1**

CH.1: Leon. The dying message was just shoved in your face. The trash room evidence made it even more undeniable.

CH.2: No, wasn't sure. I missed Mondo's comment at the start, which would've made it all clear.

CH.3: Celeste was just too obvious.

CH.4: I thought Sakura for a long time, but then doubted Aoi. Oops.

CH.5: At first, Byakuya. His knowledge of the bomb, them having worked on the bomb, etc just seemed obvious. But before trial, started to think it was nobody there...which "didn't make sense."

CH.6: Too obvious it was "Monokuma." Had to think some to figure out it was Junko, though.

**DR2**

CH.1: Suspected Teruteru, but tried for the life of me to figure out what was so important about that freaking bathroom the game kept reminding me of! lol

CH.2: Fuyuhiko was too obvious, so I suspected Sonia at first. Wetsuit would conveniently place her there and the timing helped that as well. Game didn't offer that as a clue...didn't even LET me suspect her! So, moved to next target Peko, couldn't piece together why though- not until the trial reveal.

CH.3: Mikan. Pretty much knew it was Mikan from the start.

CH.4: Gundham. He felt a bit different, and vocal, here. It didn't seem to make sense that he did it, didn't feel right/felt off, but he did.

CH.5: Sonia. She was too knowledgeable and moved about on her own will, and I even suspected her as setting things up as an accomplice for guiding us straight to the fire grenades. But then the Monomi hint and hints toward Chiaki; ah, damnit, game.

CH.6: Really? REALLY? ._. (to Junko's involvement)
**DR1**

Ch.1 = i have been suspecting from Leon because of how much he was being harsh to makoto and principally that he was the killer.

CH.2 = Obviously i suspected of mondo because of the dumbell. Believe me or not but the thing about "kid" of mondo, i suspected how he called fujisaki like that after his death.

CH.3 = everyone talking about Celestia and she was too much involved with the murdering...the photo, being attacked, how she alert everyone...too obvious

CH.4 = At first i thought it would be one of those 3 that Sakura invited. I thought Byakuya ordered toko to go and kill sakura using Jack. But i would never suspect she would commit suicide.

CH.5 and 6 doesn't count.

**DR2:**

CH.1 = a iron skewer missing and teruteru in the duty of the kitchen. He have been my suspect from the start.

CH.2 = I thought it was fuyuhiko aswell. But the empty water bottles was the definitive proof to incrimiante Peko to me.

CH.3 = Mikan wasn't stuttering like how she usually did. So i thought something happened with her.

CH.4 = Had my doubts...At first i thought was Akane because she couldn't bear watching someone who sacrificed himself for her in that state.

CH.5 = Chiaki was the most obvious choice to be the traitor since no one there looked like one and Nagito wanted to reveal the traitor's identify so...yeah, i suspected of Chiaki.

Chapter 6 is doesn't count.
You need to spoiler tag this. By the way, I've seen you do this a few times, you know you need to double carriage-return to start a new line right?

Chapter 1, easy because English.

Chapter 2, I also noticed Mondo call Chihiro 'dude' way back before the discovery, but I didn't actually realise it was him until the tracksuit thing. For a lot of the chapter I thought it would be boring enough to be just be Toko (and thank God it wasn't).

Chapter 3, pretty obvious as soon as she was the only one directing us around.

Chapter 4, the whole way the body discovery is different to the others made it fairly obvious it was a suicide and not a murder.

*****
Chapter 1, skewer pointed to Teruteru immediately, though I did get strung along with thinking it was Nagito for a while.

Chapter 2, I thought it was Sonia for a ridiculously long time.

Chapters 3, 4, and 5 I had spoiled.
**DR1**

Chapter 1: sadly the message was really obvious, poor Leon i really liked him

Chapter 2: Mondo calling Chihiro "dude" was sceptical for me, but i really just realized it when i found out the murder was in the boys room, Mondo was for me the only person that is capable of killing someone instantly with the dumb bell

Chapter 3: Celeste was really suspicious, i realized again that the motive is greed and then it struck me, was even more obvious when she randomly insulted me in the trial

Chapter 4: i thought it was Genocide Jack, but well since the room was locked from the inside and only Sakura was in i also had suicide in thought

**DR2**

Chapter 1: i only had Teruteru, Nagito and Chiaki as supects but since Nagito told pretty early that it was him with the plan and Chiaki actually making no sense i only had Teruteru left

Chapter 2: i first thought it was Sonia due to her Wetsuit, than i had Fuyuhiko but than the water bottles would make no sense, i didn't had Peko in mind until that got brought up in the trial

Chapter 3: i realized that strange mark Ibuki had around her neck, that doesnt just come by hanging so quickly and since Mikan told she definitely died by hanging, she was suspicious + she was not normal like she always was, she always said something that would make her not the culprit like that the killer had to be really fast unlike her

Chapter 4: first i thought it was Nagito, he was not there when the alarm went off and that made him suspicious but i got completely blown up that him not beeing there was actually the alibi and Gundham beeing there was his mistake, mindblown

Chapter5: Chiaki beeing the traitor made sense to me, Kazuichi is to stupid to be it (sry bro) and Akane too, Fuyuhiko and Sonia wouldn't fit as the traitor imo so i guessed it had to be Chiaki
**DR1**

*Ch1. I guessed Yamada because of reasons. I didn't really have much to go  on.

*Ch2. I had absolutely no Idea until the last minute.

*Ch3. Celeste. She was just acting weird to me.

*Ch4. I called it as a suicide the moment I saw the body.

**DR2**

*Ch1. I was kind of suspicious of Nagito at first because of his "ow" during the blackout, but when Mikan said the    wounds were way too small for it to be a knife wound, I knew it was Teruteru.

*Ch2. I guessed Hiyoko. I hated her. I wanted her to die.

*Ch3. I guessed Kazuichi. I didn't want it to be Mikan.

*Ch4. I thought suicide, because of the first game. I liked the thought of Nekomaru sacrificing himself for his friends.

*Ch5. No. Nobody wanted it to be anyone. It was heartbreaking.
DR1-1: Super easy. As soon as I saw 11037, it was so obvious.


DR1-2: I thought it might be Toko as Genocide Jack when Byakuya tried to talk to her in her room, but then realized Byakuya's leading us around meant it was more likely to actually be him. Never guessed it would be Mondo.


DR1-3: So apparently I'm really slow because I was suspicious of Celeste but then disregarded her altogether when I realized her "alibi" with Aoi, and didn't think of her as the culprit at all during the trial whatsoever, not even when it came time to select he killed.


DR1-4: Thought it would be Aoi since it'd make a good twist, never thought of suicide.


DR1-5: It was so obviously the mastermind, but I had no idea who that might be.


DR1-6: Suspected Junko solely because her death was unique in the way that she was the only one to get executed for breaking a rule other than the killing rule. Turned out to be right for reasons beyond that.




DR2-1: I thought it might be Peko, but then once she was disproven, I had no idea.


DR2-2: Once people started running from the beach, I actually guessed beforehand that someone would be murdered there, and also guessed it would be Peko, since I saw a thumbnail of Chapter 3 with Fuyuhiko in in it so it couldn't be him, and Hiyoko was ruled out once the victim's identity was discovered.


DR2-3: When Chiaki mentioned that the video could possibly have been filmed in the conference room during the investigation, I became suspicious of Mikan, but then forgot all about it for the rest of the investigation and the trial up until the "CONFERENCE ROOM" Hangman's Gambit.


DR2-4: No idea.


DR2-5: I was so sure that the traitor was Sonia, since she was the one who kept providing enigmatic info during the chapter, such as the bombs, their counterfeit nature and the fire grenades, so I thought the purpose of telling us about these thing was to manipulate us into following with her plan to kill Nagito. I also thought a couple times throughout the game that the traitor would be Chiaki since I already realized that the world was probably a simulation, and being the Ultimate Gamer would go hand in hand with that, but such baseless reasoning caused me to disregard it later.


DR2-6: I also thought that the mastermind would be Hajime, somehow, since I thought it was suspicious that he didn't know his talent, and thought he erased it for some reason, and once his reserve course student status was revealed, and that he was the only surviving member of it, that became my new reason to believe  that. But I actually primarily believed that this would be the case because it would be an unexpected twist. And I suppose I was right, in a way, since he was the one who infected the Neo World Program, allowing Alter Ego Junko to do everything that she did.
In case you haven't figured it out yet, SPOILERS

**DR1**

1: I guessed Leon easy, 11037 gave it away immediately

2: I actually had no idea, I tend to base my guesses off of cues within the story rather than actual evidence (unless it was glaringly obvious like 11037) and nothing really pointed to Mondo (except for maybe the sauna scene? But I thought it was just a moment to build the relationship between him and Taka). Either way, the way we DID find out he was the killer was absolute bullshit.

3: Celeste was acting too weird to not be suspicious

4: I knew it was a suicide the moment we walked into the room

I ain't touching chapter 5 and 6

**DR2**

1: I was actually suspecting Nagito all the way up to the point where he went crazy. Then I had no idea XD

2: No idea. I thought it was Sonia for a short while, but I figured that if she really were the killer then it was weird that she was divulging so much info on Sparkling Justice

3: The entire chapter felt like it was setting up Mikan to be the killer or the victim, either way she wasn't making it out alive

4: Again, no idea. I entertained the thought of suicide (that actually sounds really dark, but I don't mean it in that way XD), but since the possibility was brought up so blatantly I figured that couldn't be it

5: I kind of got this one. Following the patterns up till now I just knew that this wasn't going to be a normal trial, and since Hajime and Chiaki were the most important characters, I just knew that at least one of them was going to get screwed over

Not gonna touch chapter 6
#DR1:

Ch. 1: Yes, the letters were obvious

Ch. 2: No, I didn't connect the whole Chihiro thing that was going on until the trial

Ch. 3: No, everyone seemed to have an alibi

Ch. 4: Yes, it was a locked room murder

Ch. 5 & 6 doesn't count

#DR2:

Ch. 1: Yes, the 5mm wounds and the skewer seemed obvious

Ch. 2: No, I originally thought one of the guys who weren't at the diner did it

Ch. 3: No, I didn't really know who it could be for this one

Ch. 4: No, I thought Akane did this for some strange reason.

Ch. 5: Doesn't count because I hate life
Ch. 6: I was kinda expecting this but still a little blind sided


DR1 was so long ago, I really don't remember. 

In DR2:

Chapter 1 - I suspected Teruteru with the iron skewer from the start, although I didn't guess how he did it *especially* not Nagito's hand in it.

Chapter 2 - I thought Fuyuhiko and Hiyoko were too obvious, but I didn't suspect Peko at all. That took me by complete surprise.

Chapter 3 - Mikan was my first suspect, this case was pretty easy. When I saw the black curtain during the murder, I knew the video was filmed in the hospital conference room.

Chapter 4 - I had no idea at all, I didn't even catch the part where the rooms were soundproof during exposition. I still don't understand how the door handle could possibly hold a cyborg's weight, even for a short time.

Chapter 5 - I suspected Chiaki. I suspected her even after they've proven it was a suicide, I just didn't want to believe it. Why all those *pointless wounds*? But I guess the game did have its desired effect, I was just as dazed and shocked by the entire thing as someone actually experiencing it live.

Chapter 6 - I guessed that it was some sort of AI world from the beginning. I suspected one of the characters must have been an AI, but I didn't realise which until this chapter. *Other than that, it was all a bis surprise.


DR1 only

1. Yes, the name puzzle gives it away in English. More important is guessing Sayaka was trying to murder him. I suspected that from the nameplates. She would have had to do that while alive.

2. Yes, by process of elimination. It being Byakuya made no sense, but if a boy was involved, they had to be strong, capable of murder, not dumb as a stump, and hiding something (I assumed for literary reasons the secret motive worked), which made Taka, Hifumi, and Hiro all unlikely candidates. Mondo was likelier than any of them to be exercising as well. I also noticed the 'dude' slip, but I didn't connect it to Chihiro directly. I thought it was just stressed courtroom behaviour like Leon's.

3. Yeah, I think this was a character piece? I interpreted this chapter as a howdunnit since there was no reasonable alternative. I didn't guess how Celeste got an accomplice. I'm surprised the Robo Justice slip Hifumi made never came up.

4. Yes again, because Sakura was very obviously depressed, and you see her swearing to resist Monokuma when she apparently doesn't know, so it makes no sense for her to play into their hands and kill someone else after all that. Didn't fully grasp, or want to grasp, what Aoi was up to, but she did a poor job of lying. Vomiting blood instantly made me think poison, which is a popular suicide method, and when you suicide like that you bar the room so nobody can interrupt you. Aoi had no reason to poison Sakura with the candy in a locked room. Again, this was an interesting howdunnit, because I didn't know what happened to her beyond poisoning herself, and I enjoyed the end of chapter.

5. I picked to expose Kyouko's lie because I believed she would always want the truth to come out and be able to challenge it. Fucked up. Recognised Junko's fake nails.

6. Yeah this was telegraphed they kept flashing the picture of 'Junko' impaled by spears at you. It also reminded me a lot of a certain other visual novel. Plus nobody else made sense, everyone else was killed by a student.
DR1:

Ch1. The dying message was like the most obvious thing in the world. They may as well have put an arrow next to Leon saying "This is killer"

Ch2. Should've been obvious because of the dumbbell, but I didn't really think about it, so I had nobody in mind.

Ch3. When Celeste showed the photo it became pretty obvious already. Yeah sure I just casually managed to make this photo of this huge ass robot dragging Yamada away 

Ch4. Not really sure anymore, but at some point I definitely had the thought of her commiting suicide because I just thought nobody could kill her and she smart woman so she wouldn't just get poisoned that easily.

---

DR2:

Ch1. My understanding of this case was completely fucked, so I was just guessing myself through the whole thing.

Ch2. Didn't suspect anyone, but I hoped it would be Hiyoko because she was at the crime scene and I just really wanted to be rid of her.

Ch3. I thought this was gonna be a case like Ch3. in DR1. I thought Hiyoko was working together with someone and told Ibuki to go kill herself (due to her nature), and Ibuki did it because she was following orders due to the despair disease. And then that accomplice killed Hiyoko.

Ch4. Well, we're talking about a huge ass robot, so naturally I thought of Kazuichi. But I guess that would've been to easy.

Ch5. I thought Sonia was the traitor because of how insistent she was that there was no traitor at all. Also her name is fucking Sonia Nevermind, how is that not suspicious?

Chapter 1: Leon was fucking written on the wall


Chapter 2: No


All the rest I spoiled myself
I instantly knew that Sakura poisoned herself as soon as I saw her.

Celeste knew way too much about where everyone involved with the murders were to not be a suspect. Not to mention Hifumi's absurd level of unreciprocated devotion to her. 
Unmarked spoilers below.

**DR1**:Chapter 1: The killer name was literally on the wall, I only had to show how they did it.

Chapter 2: I actually had no idea, until Genocider appeared and I was sure it wasn't her, that would be too obvious.

Chapter 3: Again, no idea, But at the start of the trial I guessed right who the killer was.

Chapter 4: This one was really easy, there's almost no way that wasn't a suicide

Chapter 5 and 6: No victims If i Remember correctly.

**DR2**: Chapter 1: I didn't knew at first but when I Remembered the light stove and fire door, The only person who could've done it was the cook, i mean , chef.

Chapter 2: Peko came to de Dinner very wet after "Swimming" , But the distance between the sea and the Dinner was quite long IRC, She should've dried by then, and those empty bottles confirmed it was her.

Chapter 3: No idea, I thought it was Kazuichi or Nagito, or Ibuki killed Saiyonji and commited Sudoku, but when Mikan said one wrong line, It was quite easy to pinpoint that it was her.

Chapter 4: Because of the elevator not working and the wires and stuff, I thought it was Kazuichi.

Chapter 5: I knew One of those Bottles were poisoned, and Nagito most likely wanted to screw with everyone, which he succeded, But I thought it was going to be like Chapter 5, which you had to pick Hajime for the true end or pick Chiaki for the bad end, Too bad I tried choosing every other character at the end but Only choosing chiaki had a reaction, Even worse when Hajime says "Even so...."
The only one that completely rubbed me the wrong way was Mikan in DR2. 

I kept thinking that Mikan went to the music venue, fixed Chihiro's body, and then made it back to the Motel BEFORE Hajime. And I kept thinking this was what made her innocent. The fact that there were no spare hospital gowns also made it seem someone else was the real killer. 

I thought it would be Nagito helping out the real killer and merely pretending to have the disease, or there would be some sort of twist where Nagito's disease IS his obsession with hope (so he ALWAYS had the disease from the start). Could've been far more interesting IMO. 
    > ...fixed Chihiro's body...

Come again? Did'ja mean... Hiyoko? =]

        Yes, Hiyoko. I've been replaying the first game again and mixing up the names. 
DR1

Chapter 1 - dying message, guessed Leon

Chapter 2 - I didn't suspect anyone but Togami and I was wrong.

Chapter 3 - Celeste was so obvious, anyone could've guessed it

Chapter 4 - I thought Asahina did it because she fell to despair

Chapter 5 - Trainwreck of a trial so I didn't suspect anyone.

Chapter 6 - To be honest Junko was a mind blow to me

SDR2

Chapter 1 - I thought it was Peko because she was away from the scene.

Chapter 2 - I suspected Peko again due to the wet state of herself, which had to mean something.

Chapter 3 - Mikan was the most likely to be infected so it was a clue, I suppose.

Chapter 4 - This blew my mind, I thought it was Souda. I never expected Gundham to be the murderer instead.

Chapter 5 - I suspected Sonia because she had knowledge of the bombs but I also thought Komaeda killed himself because he seemed to be losing it at the time.

Chapter 6 - Junko returns again and that was another crazy twist.
In DR 1 I only ever had a bit of trouble with Mondo, other than him all other cases were logical and I could deduce the killer. DR2 felt like they made the strangest fucking leaps of logic and I was left guessing more often than not... I feel like they wanted to up the difficulty but went the wrong way about it.
For Chapter 5 of DR2 I honestly suspected it was going to be a repeat of DR1 case 4, with Nagito being his own killer, just like with Sakura. 
I already knew DR1 from watching the anime. DR2 Trial one was pretty obvious, trial 2 I wasn't sure but guessed Peko because I had gotten my fifth hope fragment from her right before the trial started and assume she would be the killer just to spite me. TR3 I was shocked thought Gundham did it because of a spoiler in a youtube thumbnail revealing his execution. Knew TR4 from spoiler TR5 I thought Chiaki would be the killer just so the game creators could make us feel despair and I was right.

Well,DR1 

CH.1 is pretty easy. 

CH2 threw me for a loop, though I did guess chihiro was a dude, 

CH3 Everyone says Celeste. 

Ch4. i was guessing Aoi up till the moment they pointed out the footprints

Ch5 and Ch6 were throwing me a bit. But then again Makoto nearly died, so yeah. 

DR2 

CH1 I guessed based off the injuries. Teruteru mentioned one gone, and since it would be dang hard to steal one during the party, I assumed he had one in reserve.

CH2 Again threw me 

CH3 I guessed with all the flags about Mikan doing things, and Despair Disease basically reversing peoples characters easy. 

CH4 Threw me with Nagitos comment about how the killings were similar to the first game, so i assumed Mechomaru had done it to himself somehow. 

CH5 pissed me off to no end, and not because I was wrong, but because it was decided and won by a guys talent. There was basically no indication otherwise that Chiaki could have been the traitor, mostly because of the bloody scanner! Was guessing it was Sonia up until the end. 

CH6 was me guessing Junko had been created because blah blah video game logic. 

All in all, i did well, but initial guesses are easy to use and or subvert
* Trial 1; the blood clearly said LEON
* Trial 2; I knew it was mondo. Was tottaly shocked by the Gender thing
* Trial 3; It was obviously Celeste (Justice Hammer?)
* Trial 4; I actually thought it was Asahina
* Trial 5; It wasnt Byakuya after all :_:
**DR2**

Ch.1 = I guessed Teruteru, because how the fuck was his voice even hearable this clear when he was in kitchen? Somehow it wasn't relevant though.

Ch.2 = I guessed Peko, but thought, that she somehow escaped through the ocean, not through the window.

Ch.3 = Mikan showed some strange behavior in this chapter, so I kinda guessed something was happening with her.

Ch.4 = I thought it was a suicide. Realization was heartbreaking.

Ch.5 = It was pretty much obvious that it was some kind of elaborate suicide, because nobody would kill anyone at this point. Chiaki being traitor was obvious as well - it was hinted throughout the whole game. Fuck Nagito.
> ...fixed Chihiro's body...

Come again? Did'ja mean... Hiyoko? =]

    Yes, Hiyoko. I've been replaying the first game again and mixing up the names. 
Yes, Hiyoko. I've been replaying the first game again and mixing up the names.
