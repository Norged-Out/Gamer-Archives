[[No Man's Sky is now rated Mostly Positive on Steam]]





It was a long journey to get there and I'm so happy they made it. The updates have made it a different game.
    The last statement means a lot too. They could have just left it as it was, walked away from the game as millionaires, and gone on to make the last campfire or another game to sell for more money (for whoever would be willing to buy it at that point). 

But instead they made NMS better and basically made it into a whole new game, saving their reputation and ensuring better sales for whatever comes next knowing we can still trust them after their redemption.
        This is really important to remember.

The UK has a really transparent attitude to business. You can go right now and check Hello Games figures.

They have an operating profit margin of >70%

In 2019 their total sales for was 18m with a profit margin of 76%, or 13.59m GBP in PROFIT. For a company of 20 people, that's absurd.

In 2019 they literally have 70m GBP in the bank. 70m!! Company of 20 people. That's insane.

[https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06663645/filing-history](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06663645/filing-history)
            Wow. That's a lot of money.

Let's hope that translates to NMS updates years into the future!
                It absolutely does. You often see people here saying "they can charge for the next DLC and I'll pay!", but the reality is they can make the game for 10 years from now without making a single penny in revenue, and still have money in the bank at the end.
                    Pretty cool job for life!  I'm glad they're sticking at it.
                    Nah fam, they're literally never gonna have to worry about money ever again. All they have to do is invest even a decent chunk of that money properly, and then they can do whatever they want from there, for the rest of their lives.

If I had 70 mil / 20 people, I'd make updates for NMS forever, or as long as was practical, and do it at a leisurely pace without ruining my health or general well being as the game development sector often does. (Due to virtually non-existent employee protections.)

And yeah, that'd be a dream come true. Just being able to play your passion for the rest of your life without destroying your interest due to 'necessity'. Plus the game continues to put out because more updates = more new players.

Can you imagine? It's crazy how they completely leaned into their rather abysmal failure and turned it into a resounding success. The hilarious part is that what they promised and failed to deliver at the beginning, is now completely possible because they have all the time in the world to just work on this game in any way they please.
                        if they invest in a good wallet of companies, real state, etc. 10mil they get easily enough to pay everyone there every month a good amount of money. they could use part of that money to help other small game companies make their games a reality. if the game is really good they could just add those people to their company and let them make the game as a Hello Games IP.
                    The funny this is I never seen this for other companies except for fromsoft where people will buy the dlcs as soon they come out. I would gladly buy their dlcs just to support them. But since we get it for free I wish they implement some way to support them more.
            Okay holy shit. Now I see why they don't have paid DLCs or anything like that. Like, they literally don't need that much money. I also heard that Sean pays himself surprisingly little considering that he's the boss. 

Also, I knew Hello Games was small but - 20 people?? Ubisoft has 19,000 lmao
                Props to Sean
                    Absolutely. He has put together one hell of a team!
            that is why the updates are free. that makes you think why The Sims is like it is... you need to pay like 800USd to play the game with all the things it has now
            One of the reasons they have so much money now is because they had losses earlier got a bunch of tax refunded
                That's not how that works lol

If you make losses and get tax refunded, you don't end up with 70m pound in the bank. Read the documents, it covers their revenue. They're making 15m a year with outgoing of less than 3. That's why they have 70m cash on hand.
                    I did read their statements, did you? Its in note 8.

They made $4 million and $5 million in the past 2 years respectively due to government tax credits/grants
            No, that's faith in your vision. On the opposite side of the coin you get Star Citizen - which is faith in other's gullibility.

Sean and Hello Games... congratulations on NMS 5th birthday, pulling out of the dread Steam spiral o'doom, and my personal thanks for 3+ years of in-game enjoyment- long may it continue!
        This. Even if I don't see myself playing their next project (for whatever reason), I will still purchase it out of pure support.
        still a little terrifying though that an indie studio can literally sell such a piece of shit to begin with, with full backing from bigger studio, including late night tv spots and massive amounts of fan love for what it was said to be... only for it to be what was initially released? 

i'm really happy they changed it, it would have been fine the way it was if it wasn't falsely advertised. but that false advertisement made them millionaires, them making it whole shouldn't undo the mistakes, most devs wouldn't have even had the chance to become millionaires with the game they released to begin with.

so they basically ended up where they said they would be and it took them 5 extra years with millions in advance, which would be the dream for any new dev.

a smaller man would have ran away with it (and seemingly did...). but good on them for continuing until it was up to the standard they said it would  be.
            Its been the game it was supposed to be since 2018, everything included since then has been extra and free for the last 3 years now. 

I also believe in redemption, clearly you don't I guess. 

>them making it whole shouldn't undo the mistakes

It's not undoing any mistake. Their reputation went to absolute shit for 5 years. It's only just now getting better, after years of basically working for free. Almost like a prison sentence, or at least being put on community service. They "did their time". What more do you exactly want?

5 years ago did you want their studio cancelled and closed as if that would have made the better outcome? Cancel culture... I swear...
                > Cancel culture... I swear...

Reddit: "Fucking cancel culture is ruining everything!"

Cashier: "Sir, this is a McDonalds..."
                >	I also believe in redemption, clearly you don't I guess

People are allowed to be mad, they put out a game then went radio silent for a couple of months after they got called out on its status. 

Honestly though, this sub at that time of turmoil was way better than the game! The drama was too damn good!
                    I don’t get people being mad at all, honestly. Disappointed? Sure, but not mad. Correct me if I’m wrong but most people who didn’t like the game upon release could get refunded their money, so what did they lose? Faith in a good game being made? Sure, but that seems like a very immature thing to be mad over. And even more, and immature thing to hold against them. 
Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Eh, anyone can feel however they want, but the game has been spectacular for a few years now, and has just been getting better, in my opinion. I also feel like anyone who’s still upset about it’s release needs to grow up. But that just my personal feelings about it all.
                        > Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Not in this age. A tweet doesn’t cost 12 hours and a lot of man hours to put out.  Especially when they were developing the game and they were tweeting all over the place up until the launch. How does that make sense?

Immature to hold against them? They are a company that delivered a product that was poor. If you’re new to gaming, you must be new to the complaints  gamers have about all sorts of products. It is not immature to want the features they promised.

It would be immature and naïve to assume game developers shouldn’t communicate with their consumers. Who doesn’t do that? 

As much as I hate Todd Howard, he delivered a better game with Skyrim. And when it came out buggy, they communicated and fixed it which is why that game is legendary and no man sky will be only legendary for fixing a mistake.

Hell even this announcement is odd isn’t it? Like they are on the special because they are fixing a problem, no other reason. That’s a low bar.

Also as a gaming consumer, you don’t want to get developers in this habit of delivering piss poor products with the promise of fixing it much later.
                            This was a game that got too hyped up because of communicating too much. A game that had high hopes that couldn’t be met with their resources and time. I think radio silence was the smartest move for them. 

Yes, it’s immature to hold a grudge on a small dev group that is clearly trying to make a game they love. I understand that they didn’t give what was promised but honestly? It doesn’t fucking matter. They’re trying their hardest to improve the game and it’s better now than it ever could have been at launch, and it has nothing to do with promises or talking to their fan base, but simply caring about their product. 

No Man’s Sky may be legendary to you only for fixing a mistake, but that’s not the case for everyone. They made a mediocre glitchy game to start and then built upon it. I’m sorry that you can’t move past what it was, but some of us can. 

I’ll die on the hill that living with grudges and always holding mistakes above peoples heads forever is immature, and shows a lack of growth in character. 

You can feel however you want about this game but anger is an immature emotion to feel about something so inconsequential as a video game. I’ve never felt angry when a game fails to live up to its expectations and promises because I know how hard being an artist is. No matter how grand the idea, it’s only as good as how you execute it. 

They had a bad launch but I believe wholeheartedly that every step that they’ve taken since then has been the right one. They’ve redeemed themselves, and they kept going. 

Also, I don’t think that I fully agree with your final statement. I think that a game as vast and exploration based as NMS benefits from being released as a base and then being built upon. I think if they had thought of doing it that way initially, they could’ve made the base game better, admittedly, but used that foundation to do what they’ve done, which I think is ultimately successful and a relatively reasonable model. I think it’s a very stagnant mindset to expect everything to work the same way all the time, and anything that diverts from the standard flow is unacceptable. 

They’ve done well, regardless of what you think, and deserve every bit of praise that they get. But we’re allowed to disagree, otherwise, this world would be a rather stagnant place, no?
                    Sure they are, no-one said they aren't allowed to be mad. But after they've more than made up for it by now, it make them look childish and immature to not be capable for moving on.
                        I mean that’s what people did, they moved on. The game came out in 2016, and lots video games have been coming out that have been phenomenal since then, with better releases and without drama.

I would argue it kind of hurts the industry to not give those developers props for better releases.
                            ??? one company being commended for providing free updates and fixing and expanding their game beyond the original vision doesn't mean other developers aren't getting props for their release. That doesn't make any sense. I'm getting the feeling you haven't even played the game since release to be honest.
                                Beyond their original vision? No man, this is their vision realized.

And  I think you’re confusing “free” updates with “required” updates. as in hello games required these updates if they ever wanted to function as a game company ever again. 

Their reputations were on the line,  and no one is bound to play a bad game in hopes of it getting better. 

Hello game situation is unique, but in most cases developers would walk away. Someone who had a bad launch knows that players are going to leave to play other games.

Have you been stuck on this game since 2016? Think about how many awesome games you may have missed. Games that were already done at launch. 

Doesn’t seem silly to risk that for another bad launch? what if another video game has a horrible launch, do you have to play it through and wait until they improve it? I’d argue hell no you don’t.

Don’t be a fan boy, be a good consumer.
                                    Remember that itemized list of everything promised that was missing from launch? Yea back when the NEXT update came out, they pulled that list out and 95% of it was done...

Infact majority of the games features it has now wasn't even something they promised (some were even things they said would never be in). So yea... that does count as beyond their original vision.

Obviously i haven't only played this game since 2016, this isn't about saying launch nms was fine, it was broken af. This is about saying "awesome! They gave us what was promised and then some. What a great turn of events".

Like seriously, how hard of a concept is it for you to understand that?

What i can't understand is why someone who holds such a grudge against this game keeps coming back to the reddit. Like, you talk about missing out on other games but here you are wasting your time airing your grievance about how the game was 5 years ago 5 years later.

If that isn't the definition of pathetic, idk what is. Just "move on" already ffs
    its a long way from what its potential is. we need upgrades on many facets to the game still.
    How is it for new players?
[Here's a handy breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/up9E4Dv.png) of reviews over time from [Steam250.com](https://club.steam250.com/app/275850)
    I would like to see a steam chart based on “recent” reviews, I bet NMS would be high on that list
        Recent reviews have actually gone down a few % since frontiers, at least that what I saw when I checked if it's mostly positive yet. Not sure why that is tho. Currently recent reviews are on 92%, there are plenty of games higher than that.
            New major update means a lot of bugs. These bugs get fixed really fast but most of the people try out the game right after the update and see these bugs and quit immediately leaving a review "buggy game bad" and don't touch it again.
                I think its more about the mobile game gameplay with 4 hours of waiting time for each part on buildings.
                    4 hours, not 2 weeks (very common for mobile games to have wait beyond that), also you cant skip the wait with Micro Transactions. I just think its so people don't grind all the content in one long marathon (which would be very not fun, this kind of content is meant to be segmented over time to be fun)
                        I think the problem is that the system works well as a sort of side feature during normal gameplay, but a lot of players are at "end game." Having a timer to check up on your settlement is fine when you have the main quest and other side quests and other timers from the base building questline and are upgrading your equipment...

When you're at the point where your main objective is just going where the solar wind takes you, and the solar wind takes you to this new settlement feature and it can't just be the thing you're doing, that's when it becomes frustrating. Which is why we should be able to pump some kind of resource or units or nanites or something to speed up the process.
                            They should have just made it so that it takes a lot more resources to upgrade each building. That way new players will have another thing to work towards and end game players will have something to dump their resources into. The whole waiting time thing is just AIDS.
                            The problem is that parts of buildings are split up so you have to go back multiple times. It should be one interaction and then you go away for however many hours, come back and it's finished.
                                Or have each part be immediately interactable with their own timers. So if you have the supplies for the frame but not the roof, you can start construction on that part while you get the other materials. If you have everything you need, you can start construction on all parts and have them all be done in an hour or whatever.
                        A few complaints I have heard are mainly regarding the time gating from streamer friends, they want to stream the new content and stuff, but end up just doing older content because of the gating. Makes it a very hard update to stream and showcase content, and these guys are space billionaires so it's not like they missed any content previously.
                            I dont really want game mechanics dictated by whats easier for streamers. I want the developers to think about what's best for the gameplay and the mechanics. I'm not saying whether or not they should change the time gating or not but it absolutely shouldn't be so streamers have more content and can make more money, it should be whatever makes the game more fun for the average player.
                                I get what you are saying, but as a non-streamer I absolutely hate time gates
                                    I'm not disagreeing with that at all. I just think making design choices based on streamers preferences is not a good way to go about deciding how the mechanics of games work.

Edit: wording
                                Whether anyone likes it or not, streamers are an important aspect that has to be considered from a development and community standpoint. More and more, streamers are becoming a determining factor in a long-term health and viability.
                        4 hours two weeks it does not matter tbh. The problem is that you had to wait to throw almost nothing in there then you have to wait again. During the 12 hour total session it takes i could have built 100 similar landing pad. In a game if its not mobile game idling timers are just stupid and unnecessary. The game supposed to engage the player and not to make them go away and then come back for 3 minutes to perform a click just to wait another 4 hours.
Make the settlement building engaging. Force the player (By making actuall high rsc needs for buildings) to either actually grind the resources for the building or buy it. Atleast we would have some use for units after buying our dream ships and freighter.
                        Better then having to wait a year to have your city completed. You should be able to speed it up atleast with batteries or some shit.
                            Seriously. It's painful seeing my settlement just get farther and farther into debt faster than things can build.
                                I'm not having the same experience. I'm on my 7th building and my debt is only about 175k. I did choose mostly production boosting buildings first off. So the income is healthy.

Also I went to multiple settlements and looked at stats before claiming one. My first was just a test run just to figure out mechanics. Found and claimed a new one shortly after.
                                    I also looked at about a dozen or so and couldn't find one better than C class.
                Yeah, Steam reviews just aren't very reliable. In my experience the bugs mostly have to do with textures loading in, definitely nothing that constitutes a negative review. (especially in a world where games like Cyberpunk and ARK exist)

Granted I waited until friday to play the update, but that's when it went on sale anyways (I've had the game since Origins), and thus when all the new people flooded in.
                Or perhaps we don't like the game as it is today? P
            Because the new update turned the game into a buggy mess, combined with the fact that the new update gave the game a lot of exposure on steam so that many new players had their first day in game being just after it was broken by frontiers...

It's not hard to see how that would farm you some negative reviews.

They *really* need to be fixing the rest of what was broken sooner rather than later. Combining the game's high exposure days with it's high bug count days isn't good.
    How did it lose over 1,000 negative reviews between 2020 and 2021?
        I never tried writing Steam reviews so I'm not sure if that's allowed, but my guess is people changed their old negative reviews to positive.
            I’m one of those. Once Frontiers made the universe feel alive I really felt like we’d come full circle and changed my review. 

Also I’d kind of forgotten I’d rated it negatively back when it launched. I’m glad I reinstalled!!
            That's absolutely allowed. Steam won't let you add a second review but will let you edit an old one or delete it. I recently changed my review of another game from recommended to not recommended due to what the asinine developers are doing to that game.
                Should I ask what game that is?
                    I immediately thought "world of warcraft" lol... i know it's not but it fits the description lol
                        I got into wow again a month before the whole shitshow happened and was keen to play it, then just stopped subbing. Hope blizzard sorts their shit out
                            Yeah I did too. I rerolled, leveled my Alliance (the ratio is another mess) char up. Just got into the Maw for the first time and started to noticed less and less of the guild was online. I asked,, and unsubbed.
                What game is that, so I can avoid it too!
            There was quite a big campaign on the subreddit here reminding people to change their reviews.
            Just seems odd that it happened all at the same time and it didn’t happen before.
                Maybe a big update came out? Origins came out in September 2020, and I remember everyone saying "now we've finally got the game they'd promised" and "NMS is finally good".
                    Don't forget covid struck. A lot of people may have started playing again after not for a long time do to quarantine and found the improvements.
                        Oh yeah, I forgot about Covid

...is a phrase that most people probably won't say for a while...

but I actually did.
                            Amnesia one of the side-effects. :-D
                                Nah man, that a different game series. /s
                            I keep forgetting that its been a fucking year since it started. It feels like that shit started like 4 or 5 months ago
                                I feel you man it's been a long 2020
                                We're approaching two years.

And I would hold onto my pants, because due to various circumstances I won't bother getting into, doesn't seem like it will be going away for a while.

Nerds truly did inherit the Earth when the COVID-19 update was released for Life.
                I can be wrong, but it seems to be aligned with the Origins release (Sept 2020). Which would make sense, as this was (in my book) by far the best update.
                    The down tick started in the beginning of 2020, Origins released September 2020.
            You can redo your review at any time as long as you have the game.
            You can indeed change your review later.
        Likely to be people switching their original negative review to a positive one :)
            That’s normal but to that extreme fluctuation isn’t do they get those statistics solely from Steam reviews?
                Like people said above it's probably just because of an update which reminded them to change their review. As for Steam250 I believe they pull all their live data directly from Steam reviews
                "Extreme fluctuation?" It's 1,000 reviews of nearly 50,000 negative reviews. That's barely 2%.
        I'm one who was disappointed until the [engoodening of no man's sky](https://youtu.be/O5BJVO3PDeQ). Honestly it's now not even what I want to play, not the game I wanted, but before it was pretty much empty and repetitive. It's still probably that way too some degree but without any additional money it's become a real fully featured game with great developers who care about the product and people. That's worth my respect at least.
            They definitely made it into a 60$ game, when it came it it definitely wasn’t which is pretty much proven by the fact the active players a day went from a quarter of a million to the hundreds in less than two months on Steam.
        Change your review.
        Maybe covid. Lots of free time not leaving the house equals more people playing games they wouldn't?

I know that I finally played an MMO during my lockdown and also finally figured out how monster hunter works, never would have done either if I was able to leave the house
    The price history is also very interesting. It goes on to 50% off quite often, more often than I thought honestly.
        Always goes on sale at update time. Often does it during steam sales too.
            I know that, I just mean it goes on sale way more often than the game updates. Did you even look at it? It went on sale 7 times this year alone. There has not been 7 updates this year.
    We're accelerating!
    I like how there is a hefty amount of positive reviews even at start.  Many players saw potential despite all that drama and hate back then. Maybe this is why NMS have such strong and wholesome community.
    What a strange graph. At first glance it looks like there are more positive reviews than total.
This is great news indeed! I always felt a bit sad whenever I went to the store page and saw that "mixed" tag, the game hasn't deserved that for quite some years now, super glad the tides are finally turning!

And to anyone reading this that for whatever reason has yet to rate the game, please do so! Hello Games deserves all the love! It's our time to GIB now :)
    I'd have to get it on Steam to rate it here. I have it on my PC through the Microsoft store. Xbox Play Anywhere!
        Offer it to a friend !
            Would we be able to play together if we were on separate sources?
                You can, but voice communication would be difficult. I’ve had to play with my step son on his Xbox and me on pc while he uses discord on his tablet
                    Couldn’t you just use the Xbox app on your Pc? 

I do that to play Forza with a friend who is on Xbox
                        Oh... I never thought of that. I have everything Xbox disabled because it was Messing with rocket league a while back and I had forgotten that I had it. Great idea
                            It’s not the best platform on PC but it’s much simpler for the other party, and sound quality should be better than on a tablet.
                                I imagine that a headset can be pluged as on a phone, or with a usb OTG.
                    That's what Discord is for! 😁
                About all I read you can play cross platform, there is no cross save game (xbox to PS to PC)

                    Yeah GOG is weird with high-end games like this. So is Epic Games. Though EG is somewhat less so.
                        [Outdated]
    I'm going to wait and see what they do about the most recent update, because it broke the game for many of us and wasn't much fun for many who it did work for.
    I’d say defrauding consumers and lying to the public about your product to use early adopters as involuntary kickstarters reason enough to keep “mixed” for some time.
        Thanks for your input, u/SniffMyRapeHole
            Lol wtf
            That guy's comment was decidedly not r/rimjob_steve material
        You can blame the publisher for pushing the developers to release an unfinished game. 

The devs have been doing a lot to make the game what they promised and I feel they deserve the comeback. It’s a fun game that exceeded my expectations when I picked it up last year.
            And Sony for promoting what was essentially an indie game as a big triple A release. No way it could've lived up to expectations at launch
        I get where you're coming from. HG messed up and were complete noobs when it came to PR, but that doesn't mean they don't deserve to redeem themselves. For some reason there's people who's values will not allow them to forgive them no matter the fixes and content inclusions *just* because of what happened half a decade ago.

But what's equally as weird as people legitimately upset that it's not rated "overwhelmingly positive" due to how much they like this game when there's clearly issues with it. Apart from basic bugs and polish, the major complaint from people who don't like the game has been that the gameplay loop doesn't push you to do anything.
            That the gameplay loop isn't a thing and isn't pushing me to do anything is precisely why I love the game. There are a million games I can play to linearly progress through a bunch of pre-determined series of events, and that's been more or less the definition of a video game for decades. It's nice to have an endless expanse and lots of options for things to do where I can just relax and go about whatever I please at whatever pace suits my energy/attention levels in that moment.
                Booooooo. Honestly I've rated the game down for its lack of depth and boring gameplay loop. People like you who defend that and say "actually less is more" are terrifying to me as you allow companies to get away with the absolute bare minimum. Let me elaborate.. 

A sandbox game is great if only two things are accomplished 

1. The player is given fun toys. NMS has done this.

2. The game has given players ways to utilize these toys. NMS has not done this.

This results in an aimless gameplay loop where the player can get "stuff" but there is nothing to do with said "stuff". For example.. You can get a mech. Awesome. What can you do with mech? What practical application is there? Does it allow you to do something you could not do before, like go to a special planet or get a special item? We know the answer obviously, but this is the depth issue that NMS suffers from.

Not to mention to be a game *centered* around exoration, the exploration *sucks* in this game. Once you've seen 5 planets you've effectively seen them all. There is no real sense of exploration, no matter where you go. Just big rolling hills, deep chasms the look ugly as sin 99% of time and a static sea level. No changes in biome, unique geographical features, just the same boring terrain over and over again. The most exciting terrain you'll find is maybe some under sea caves, but that's about it. Now go play valheim and be amazed by what proc gen can accomplish. Rolling meadows, dense mysterious forest and rivers, towering mountain peaks, and vast swamps. 

Hello Games have actually done very little to improve NMS. Most of these updates are useless fluff that adds buggy, half thought out features to the game that nobody cares about or asked for. Then like clock work the sycophants howl on Twitter praising hello games for never giving up, despite the game being announced live service on launch, and pretending like riding on animals or exploring boring derelict freighters are what was missing from this turd turning into a polished gem stone. Multiplayer is still buggy and useless, missions are ab-so-lutely crap, the "story" is a jumbled mess of incomprehensible pseudo-intellectualism that is presented in the most un inspired lazily way (another hot take, its similar to foullout 76's format of telling the story through "chasing ghost" except even that game had some sense to add good environmental story telling to keep it from being boring).

I know I'm going to get downvoted to hell, but honestly your comment just really bothers me. You all are so willing to except such a sub par product and put it on such a high pedestal.. its like looking at a cult.
                    > You all are so willing to except such a sub par product and put it on such a high pedestal.. its like looking at a cult.

This is exactly how I feel every time I read any of the Nintendo or Nintendo game subs. 

Really don't understand how some game developers get absolutely crucified for making even the tiniest mistake but others can get away with doing the bare minimum or less and be praised for it. 

I wouldn't say your critique of NMS is entirely fair but overall I agree with the sentiment.
                        I totally agree! Nintendo bugs the hell out of me too! They absolutely get by doing the bare minimum.
                    Hey, calm down maybe? The fact that it terrifies you and enrages you that different people like different things than you do is borderline sociopathy. You've got a lot of growing to do to be able to accept that not everyone is going to fit your cookie cutter shape, and that's OK, because there are other shapes and they are great too in their own way.
                        Hearing critiscm about a game prompts you to call the critic a sociopath? That's very healthy behavior. I never once insulted you, I just gave a very well thought out opinion. Maybe you should relaxe and re evaluate some things.
        I think they’ve more than made up for it
        It’s been 5 years of continuous updates, I think that qualifies as “some time”
        oh ill sniff it alright
        its been 6 years. it could have changed easily 4 years ago
        I'd it doesn't represent the current state of the game it's really not an accurate picture of it. That happened like 6 years ago. It's not the game that we've had for some time.

This is like 1 starring a product because shipping damaged the box or Amazon sent you the wrong thing.
            That’s not an apt analogy. You’re saying that even if you received the wrong product from Amazon you’d 5 star what you originally ordered anyway?



>	it doesn’t represent the current state of the game 

Right. What’s the issue here? Steam offers “recent reviews” and a cumulative total. Both recent and cumulative offer an accurate picture. It was a trash game at launch but recently it’s really really great. They deserve the hit they took at launch snd deserve the credit for building the game up to what it is now.
        seriously impressive for someone to intentionally mislead themselves like this for over five years.
        The only reason you’re being downvoted is because consumers forget shit like this way too soon.

The fact that the devs cleaned up after the publishers mess is honorable, but we can’t have that as the norm.
            It usually isn't the norm.  Normally the devs of a dud game, make a few patches then just move on.
                Anthem anyone?
    I wouldn't say "some years" tbh. The latest update with cities is the one that would most definitely bring it to "recommended" in my book. Before that the core gameplay loop still would feel a bit boring to many of players.  
Now we have a mini-city-sim inside the game, so we can keep more players in the game, that patch just broke the threshold of why players would stay/come back to play the game, hence why we're at positive reviews now.
Finally.
We get a VERY POSITIVE one day... :)
I'm happy for Hello Games. They turned it totally around. However I have not forgotten. I hope their next game release implements learned lessons.
    They put out a new game already. Go play it now and see for yourself!
And they're not even done yet
    That continues to surprise me. There is no other game in my library that I keep getting blindsided by new updates with new content for absolutely free, years after it was released.
        KSP
            Terraria dropped a huge patch 10 years into its life cycle
                I still look for terraria updates every time I'm browsing my steam library. A man can hope, right? Ive put like 500 hours into that game. Every new big patch would give me the urge to start from scratch again
            Sadly finished now..
        Minecraft
        Warframe
        PoE, 7Days2Die and AoE II come to mind.
        It's because they're filthy rich due to a combination of initial hype buys + committing to fixing their launch failure, which inevitably led to continued player growth.

They have tens of millions for a small company of 20 people. They can just invest that green and then develop their brain child forever if they feel like it, without ever charging another dime.
I got the game the day it came out and didn’t play it for a few years. Restarted last October and am loving it
    [deleted]
        Oops lol. I meant play
would be time for a new engoodening of no mans sky video (youtube video)!
I dropped a solid 100hrs into this game on PS4 launch, thought it was cool but hallow. 

Recently picked up a steam version on sale for frontiers update. Oh my god, it’s a completely different game. It’s everything I imagined the game would be at launch.

Kudos to the HG team for never abandoning their game.
Meanwhile in r/gaming: "Fuck that game and fuck that developer, it's still trash"
    Some of that, but mostly it’s the “I tried it for 30 minutes and all you do is shoot rocks. There is nothing to do in this game.” posts that I keep seeing.

Personally I can’t remember the last time I mined anything. It’s much easier to set up fleets/mines/farms/trading/scanning/quests/whatever and get just about anything you desire that way. Once you figure out what’s fun for you just invest in that and you’re set.

It’s like saying all you do in Minecraft is punch trees.
        The new player experience is kinda shitty
        >Personally I can’t remember the last time I mined anything. It’s much easier to set up fleets/mines/farms/trading/scanning/quests/whatever and get just about anything you desire that way. Once you figure out what’s fun for you just invest in that and you’re set.

That's all a little bit into the game though. So if all you played was the early portions where you are mining often and you come back and you still have to hand mine often, it looks like things haven't changed much.

The core gameplay loop is still pretty similar to launch, there's just *a lot* more to do outside of that pretty typical loop and that you can eventually break out of it.

NMS has come quite a long way indeed, but there are still legitimate gripes against the way it plays. Which, like, if it isn't for you, it isn't for you, but people gotta take it way too far as capital G Gamers.
            A lot of people’s gripes were reasons I liked the game. Since launch this game was my zen game, I would come home from high school stressed as balls and play some NMS to chill out. Nowadays, it’s no different with college.
            yup, I’m one of the people that just can’t get into it. it’s a good game and it’s improved astronomically since launch, but I still can’t find anything to hold my attention in it. made it about 60 hours before giving up trying to find stuff that interested me
        Never punched a tree in Minecraft, but that is literally how you start Ark.  Except when you start Ark by getting eaten by an Alpha raptor, and don't start punching trees until you respawn somewhere safer. 

And of course every game out there, whatever you do right at the start is what you do the entire rest of the game.  Just like PacMan - you eat one dot you've eaten them all.
            Fk ARK is such an addictive little cryfest of a game. So much better w mods and improved rates but even so. Awesome awesome game but damn is it a timesink, lol.
                Ark is a strange game. Its brutal and fun. It makes you angry, mad, even maybe keyboard ending but then you want more.

I dont have words for my feelings with Ark. Even Dark Souls isnt as brutal.
                    Right?! Like 'omg I just lost all my stuff in this cave and I can't get back and damnit I really needed that gun from that drop, this game sucks I'm just gonna log off.

... okay but I should breed my wolves first and oh right I gotta put fertilizer in the crops and oh wow is that a max level yuty hold on'

Evil, evil, evil game.
        Go figure essentially a sandbox let's you do whatever you want and you may not get in the weeds right away huh lol
        I didn’t leave a negative review for the game, but I really couldn’t get into it. You have to concede that the first few hours of the game really drags a bit, and there isn’t a very clear goal for a new player. 10 hours in and I really didn’t know what I was supposed to be doing, so I stopped.  I like games with complexity but I really never found a gameplay loop, and I think it’s hard for new players or players who don’t have a lot of time to get into it. Maybe if there was some kind of jump start into the mid game maybe? Idk. I just wish the game was a bit more transparent about what I’m working towards.
            Just follow the quests you get, build bases, and explore every new thing you see. Your own goals should start forming before long.

It helps if you have a really, really open mind. Like a 'it's about the journey, not the destination' kind of approach. Way too often, I find myself getting completely derailed from what I was doing previously to pursue some other thing, and I'm totally okay with it.
                I gave it at least 10-15 hours in a single play through (I think I have maybe 30-40 hours total?) and I still wasn’t feeling any impetus to do much of anything. I was building a base but I didn’t know why. I had to go mine stuff and it felt tedious. I like hard games, I like challenging games. I just need some kind of gameplay loop to be evident within a reasonable about of time. NMS is opaque.
            Ah, you might want to try an expedition. They are limited time multiplayer events where you start with certain equipment on a specific planet and have to complete specific goals. A new one is starting soon so keep an eye out for it.
    Uh, most of r/gaming just think it is boring but acknowledge it turned around from being trash at launch to pretty good.
        Ill always sit in Team "I bought at release and got burned".

But honestly, I saw the Frontier update and starting again. But id still prefer my refund, its still a game maybe worth about half what I paid for it, 5 years ago.

Id buy it today at the discount rate its at. However, I dont feel Hello Games ever made it right. Its hard, im trying to be sympathetic to the people playing it today but unless youve been so badly burned as I felt at release, I dont think youll ever get why I will keep my negative review forever.

If I ever see my refund ill change it to positive and rebuy it at the price its worth.

        For what it's worth, that robot never says anything you need to hear. Sometimes it'll give you warnings, but those always come accompanied with big visual warnings as well. You could mute the robot entirely and still play fine.
        If I'm remembering right, the only English-voiced NPC (aliens are voiced but in gibberish; the subtitles are translated as you learn more words) is the one that gives you messages like "temperature stabilizing", "shields down", and "extreme hazard planet". I think during that initial quest where you find your ship there's a bit of "system startup" type lines, but that's it.

In the top left corner is your health and shields for you/your ship, and you'll have a visual indicator of these going down if you get hit enough times.

Bottom left is your hazard protection and oxygen, these bars are always going down and always visible (unless you're in a building, where you're safe and they're stable), so the indicator is there.

For imminent threats like incoming storms, sentinels searching for you, hostile pirate ships in space, a text notice appears on screen, usually in the middle where it's very visible.

I do agree that subtitles/messages should be more complete AND consistent in terms of placement on screen, but almost everything that's voiced does have some form of either graphic or text indicator as well. It's definitely not perfect, but past that first quest, it's basically all generic notices
        I’m hard hearing/partial deaf in one ear with MASSIVE tinnitus…

It is a MUST to have captions. Any game that doesn’t include that is just plain lazy.
        push through, the voice messages aren't important at all. there are even mods that make the robot voice shut up.

the only important info is on the bottom right of the screen, from the exosuit guidance system.
            [deleted]
                there is dialog, it’s part of some of the main quests.. But I think those do have subtitles
        I listen to podcasts while playing. You're not missing *anything.*
        As others have pointed out, the robot voice isn't important and actually gets annoying once you're past the early game stage because it keeps pointing out the obvious.

Of course there was no way for you to know that so this is still an accessibility issue. I recommend reporting this as a missing feature on HG's website (https://hellogames.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013870118-I-have-an-issue-to-report-in-NMS). It was only a few months ago that they added a colour blind mode for the galaxy map, so they might still add more accessibility improvements if enough people ask for them.
        The voice over doesn’t matter at all. The only important information you need will be displayed as text on screen
        Just want to throw my hat in with everyone else: there's no 'spoken text' that you need to hear. 100% of important information is either solely text - like conversations and narrated events - or accompanied by text / obvious indicators, such as hazard / life support or combat alerts.

And actually, before long the robot voice becomes something of a negative...

Why?

Because when you're sprinting across the surface of an extreme weather planet back to your ship because you forgot to fuel the fucker before you ventured out so it can't automatically come to you, and left all of your hazard recharging material IN said ship, that god damn robot is repeating "BRO YOUR HAZARD SHIELD IS GOING DOWN" every 15 seconds while you're scrambling to find hazard recharging materials while getting back home, and I just wish I could physically punch the robot voice in its non-existent face.

And then you realize you can just dig into the ground to stop all of that garbage, and the robot voice is relegated back to a forgettable warning machine.
    I just came from over there and saw that

        Name a major developer that hasn't done this.

I'll wait.
            nice whataboutism. Try and think about why this game was the worst reviewed game on steam for a long time and get back to me.

I’ll wait.
    I don’t say fuck that game, but I got stuck with NMS after using my 2 hours on steam to try and get the game to work (didn’t support 1080 without crashing at launch). Steam denied my refund and was stuck with it at 30 minutes of actual play time but 2:10 of “steam playtime.”

I recognize the game is good now, but I’ll never forget or buy another Hello Games product. They built their game by tricking and lying to consumers for funding.
        The real lesson to learn from that is not to pre-order or buy games right after release. Always wait for proper reviews, and ideally bug fixes.
            Unfortunately no one learns this lesson. Just look at the clearly scam games at Kickstarter that promise impossible things by people with no experience in game development and manage to raise millions in funding.(like dreamworld and ages of elyria), or even at games like cyberpunk
                I mean No Mans Sky helped me dodge Fallout 76 a year later. I remember when the Bethesda devs released that letter like a week before release and it reeked of pure desperation, the "it wont be for everyone" and I went, gee... where have I seen that shit before and remembered Sean Murray's "Your Universe Awaits" letter.

Remember, No preorders.
            >	The real lesson to learn from that is not to pre-order or buy games right after release

The subtext to this “lesson” is that game developers are liars and shouldn’t be trusted. NMS is good but I can’t support the Hello Games worship propagated by people in this sub.
                > I can’t support the Hello Games worship propagated by people in this sub.

Go back five years and see this sub then. Many of the top posts of all time are still from that time. See how negative a lot of people were about the game when it was bad. And then, over time, the game got better and just like that, people started feeling better about it. The "worship propagated" here is exactly because the company came through, fixed the game and keeps developing it. And that's good.
                    Yeah, but this guy wants to make shit up to justify to themselves why they are right and everyone else is wrong.
                Yeah, I see that statement time and time again, and then I see from the same people how much they can't wait for a new game to be ready for pre-order.
                > game developers are liars and shouldn’t be trusted

This is unfortunately the state of the industry these days. You can't trust developers or publishers.

Even if you think they have their heart in the right place, you never know what kinds of compatibility problems exist, game breaking bugs, or sequels that just have bad gameplay.

You can't trust reviewers who get early access to games because that industry has been compromised. If a game gets panned by a reviewer, they will never get another review copy of a game from that publisher again. It's a quid pro quo system and early review copies are reviewers lifeblood.
                It’s definitely a valid opinion, anybody with a critical outlook on the game gets downvoted even if it’s a valid opinion or statement. Reddit is a platform that was made to encourage open discussion, not censor people who hold differing opinion to others.
        relationships with you must be fantastic with this level of “i just absolutely cannot ever possibly let shit go. ever.”
        And that was commentary from "SniffMyRapeHole." Now, to sports
            I might have even found some iota of wisdom in what they were saying if it wasn't for that name.
        Sounds like a steam problem to some extent
            I mean, release a functional game with the features you promise and refund polices are moot, no?
                But if you don’t like the game you can just refund it.
                    Please reread what I posted

            The right answer is honesty. He didn’t “hype the game a bit much” he straight up said features were in the game that weren’t. No space battles, no base building, no multiplayer, etc. he didn’t just say “this will be the greatest game you ever play!” He literally told me (us, the viewer) that the game was one thing and had features it most certainly did not have. And they were BIG features that made it a completely different game. 

If they had delayed or he had not said the things he did or explained the office situation I’d have more compassion, but it wasn’t just one instance. It was interview after interview where he just totally lied. I bought the lie.

Game is great now and what I thought I was buying 5 years ago. It’s just a shame that it took five years and destruction of consumer confidence to get there.
                If you don't want to move on, then hold yourself along with Hello Games accountable for your apparent misery. You irresponsibly bought into the hype and are a direct contributor to the gaming industry's shitty practices.

                    He's just one of those deeply angry people. It's got nothing to do with HG or video games in general. As Chad Daniels says, he's one of those people that wakes up in the morning and says "How can I be a victim today?"
            A bit
    Bruh every time NMS gets mentioned on reddit, IGN on facebook or youtube it's always flooded by people saying "biggest redemption arc ever xD", "thank goodness they didnt just flee with the money, thank you sean!!!" etc.
hello games literally clawed their way from overwhelmingly negative to mostly positive, seriously impressive work
It is first time I see a game on Steam go from Overwhelmingly Negative to Mostly Positive. It is an impressive achivement.
finally! congrats to hello games :)
I started playing recently. I really like the component of meeting aliens and slowly learning their language and culture.  

I love languages in real life. I speak a tiny bit of about five or six now. Recently read the Bourne Identity and realized I could follow all of the French. Watched Dark in German without subtitles just to see if I could pick up the German just by listening.  

Are the alien species procedurally generated too or is there a predefined set of them?
    The intelligent alien species are predefined. Creatures you find on planets ofc are procedurally generated (which I just wanna point out Proc gen and predefined are basically the same thing but I get what you mean).
    Man theres so much lore for you to uncover
    [deleted]
        Click to select instead of hold is now an option. On PC, you can press keys on the number row to select dialogue choices. Console users can use the d-pad to quickly select choices.

Overall, the dialogue UI is generally more pleasant to use than it was several years ago.

Alien npcs are largely unchanged in appearance and animations. There are still the 3 original species - Gek, Korvax, and Vy'keen. A few more dialogues were added over time but it's still mostly the originals. There are also rarer Traveller npcs with strange and sometimes rewarding interactions; Their speech does not need translating.

I learned the languages semi-passively by using knowledge stones and monoliths while exploring and doing other things, rather than painstakingly walking up to every npc on stations. I did that a fair bit early on but it got old fast.

You can also build translator upgrades for your exosuit that guarantee a few words in each alien's sentence will be translated even if you don't know them, it's quite helpful, especially when few words are known.

Station interiors look mostly the same with only minor decorative variations. I suspect that may be subject to change in the future based on the focus of procedural structures/interiors added to derelict freighters in Desolation, and town settlements in Frontiers.

                Astroneer is a lot of fun :)

I can relate, it's always an experience coming back to a game and totally forgetting how to do everything lol. There's lots of helpful, friendly people here and on the NMS Discord if you have any questions about the game.

Good luck on your travels!
                    [deleted]
                        Options -> General Options -> Hold to confirm

You still have to hold to begin dialogue with npcs and interact with objects etc., but every in-menu hold is replaced with clicking
Yes! I was just wondering if this happened!
Good.  It was "Mostly Positive" Vanilla.  It's definitely deserves the "Very Positive" today.
Skipped a 50% off sale to buy NMS at full price. Had to support the devs for their hard work and loyalty to the community. Best game I have played yet.
Gotta say I actually liked it at release, but all I wanted to do was tool around, explore, and upgrade my ship. The updates have been great though
Never played it on release. Been playing for a week now and i gotta say i'm impressed, absolutely worth playing now.
This game is the only review I have ever posted on steam. I cannot get over how much of a redemption arc this game has gone through. Thank you Hello Games.
Finally. Today is a good day.
We did it, interlopers.
Let’s goooo!!!!!
I hope Biomutant will reach the same.
the good ending
Nice!
ayy les go
YES! We did it!
We did it!
Wooo! I left my review a few days ago after having just started this game.
congratz! 5 years of hard work!
Holy shit finally
That's such a big achievement.

It sucks when there's so many reviews that are SO out of date. Like, a lot of the negative ones are from launch, which is honestly a completely different game from where we're at now.
We did it, travelers!
And so it should be

            Technological limitation - your save game can only keep track of so many terrain modifications before it starts overwriting old ones.

In the original game concept that wasn't really a problem, as you were unlikely to ever go back to where you had been, but now with having umpteen bases everywhere, it is an obvious issue.
                [deleted]
                    Minecraft and NMS's save structures are fundamentally different.

Minecraft's save files will inevitably bloat to many Gigabytes in size after enough time and exploration, as every single generated chunk and voxel's state is stored.

NMS generates and completely deletes voxel terrain data as the player moves around, regenerating it again as needed, with only player-made edits being stored in the save.

Unlike Minecraft, NMS is also made with cloud saving in mind. So the number of terrain modifications that can be stored is limited as the save file is ideally kept as small as possible. HG could go the Minecraft route, but at the cost of losing cloud save support and the inevitable massive save bloating.

All that aside, bases are glitched and don't retain terrain edits as they are intended to. Land fills back in long before the base's terrain edit limit is even reached and/or no other edits have been made.

                            Absolutely, and it is indeed supposed to work like that but doesn't :(

To my knowledge, HG has made several attempts to fix it with no success

                                    I'm hoping they can fix it too. It would open up so many exciting possibilities for base building!

Good luck out there Traveller, I hope that you can one day (soon) return in full glory with an unburied base <3
                    Minecraft uses servers to store your changes.  It also has a miniscule map in comparison to NMS. 

These make it _completely_ different from a technology perspective.

And yes, I get it that this destroys part of the gaming experience, it's been a constant source of complaints ever since base-building wherever you wanted has been a thing.  Originally you could only claim existing base-computers, and these where always placed on a flat piece of land.  Sounds similar to settlements, doesn't it? Cue people complaining they want to build their base anywhere. Hmm.. we've already got people asking to start their own settlements anywhere.
This is the greatest moment in gaming history. I really hope HG is proud of their achievement. I bought a second copy just to say thanks. What an amazing comeback!
i have a question, how can I own settlements? I just started out and I am wondering if its a quest line or its like buying freighters?
    It's a distress call you get in space in a system while in your ship, that then starts its own separate quest tracking. Not sure if you need to have completed more main quest stuff, or if it can trigger the first time you leave a planet as soon as you get your ship repaired.
        I'm on creative, maybe its a random event, but i haven't started the main story.
THIS CALLS FOR CELEBRATION!!!
WE’VE DONE IT, BROTHERS!
They earned it twice over
After being a fierce critic of Hello Games at the beginning, I've now pumped 300+ hours into this game. This is the gold standard of post release support
It turned to

* 68% at around 152800 votes (22 April)
* 69% at around 157310 votes (didn't write down date but around end of June)
* 70% at around 162340 votes (today!).
I was kinda sad after finally trying the game again  after all the work they put into it, and still didn't really enjoy it.  Just not the game for me I guess.  :(
thats amazing!!!
The impossible journey continues...
WE DID IT REDDIT!!!
The settlements could definitely use a little streamlining in terms of building but other than that this has been the best update in a long while.
He done itttt
:)
:D
Wrote my long overdue reviewa couple days ago.
Well I know what I’m gonna do this week
This is exactly where I’m at with it
Leeeets fucking gooooo
woooooo!
Good, as it should
*Sean Murray vindictive masturbatory sound intesifies*
Hell yeah
YES
Its deserves, they really turned it around.
Well deserved HG! Keep up the good work!
This is redemption at its finest.
Sorry if I'm wrong, but I heard the extremely poor release version of the game wasn't Sean Murray's fault, and it was Sony's for pushing the game release too early?
    Pretty much. The game was hyped to an impossible level and had they not been tied to sony and pretty much fixed release dates, they would have been able to delay it long enough to fix stuff or release it as a beta or something.
        I felt bad for Sean Murray, he got so much put on him for the release.
In terms of the depth of content, this game is going in the direction of a 3D Starbound (which is a good game, too!) and away from its initial comparison as an arcade SpaceEngine with a walking simulator.
Soon we will see overwhelmingly positive. Remember this comment.
🚀
Am I the only one that thinks that "very positive" sounds more positive than "mostly positive" ?
That's real good and all, but can I co-op base build with a friend yet? Sharing resources and quests and the like?
    You can do all 3 I mean you can't share quests but if you do them together it works
they didn’t only fix their game and bring it up to the standard we wanted from the beginning, but they managed to make it even better than we could have hoped for 

truly blessed individuals
And this was "Overwhelmingly Negative" at the beginning. Hats off to HG for not dropping it like a hot potato and constantly improving on it with no extra cost!
Makes sense to me. I bought the game on Friday and haven't been able to stop playing it all weekend. 

I know it had one of the worst roll-outs of all time but it's so god damned ambitious I can't really see how they could have done it without it being a mess, or waiting 15 years.
This is so exciting! I still play my original 2016 save file. There may have been multiple year gaps, but I've always enjoyed the game. Seeing it between those gaps has been stunning... it evolved so much!

I still remember when elements towered into the air! I used to carve them into statues with my laser. My favorite was a cat made of emeril. Now elements are in the ground which, frankly, make much more sense. I sure couldn't find them for a while, though, haha! Fun times.
    Ditto, I still have my first save file. Can't remember what version of the game I last played it though... I wonder if I reinstall from disc whether it would load in the original game.  I've tended to start a new save whenever there was a major update.

I really wish they would have stayed with fantasy elements though; makes it much more believable than mixing real elements with fantasy.
        I think it just depends on how you play! It still seems pretty fantasy to me when I play. Well, as fantasy as a sci-fi game gets, but that's because my play style is pretty heavily exploration based. I like finding all the things. ...I have a pet six legged unicorn cat. I can ride it like a knight.

I have the PC version so I never got a disc, unfortunately. With Steam it'd just make us update it. Hopefully someone else can answer that other question. I kind of suspect they'd make it update. Perhaps there's a base version out there somewhere, though?
            If I reinstall on my PlayStation with network disabled, it will run the disc version..  although, we had a Day-1 patch at the time and there's no way to get that anymore.  And that's a good point - I don't think the disc version could load the savegame.
Not only that, but when you look up the word Redemption in the dictionary now, there's an image of Sean Murray next to it.
I still have my negative review up because of their direction. The game doesn't feel like a space exploration game anymore. They changed the pro-gen system multiple times and every planet looks the same now. You can see every possible planet type within a few hours. They also decided to focus on making us stay still with the bases. It just feels like the updates are made to distract us so that we stop exploring. I will update my review when an exploration update comes up but for now it will stay negative. I fully expect downvotes for my opinion by the way.
    I played the game at launch for about 90 hours and stopped after the pathfinder update. I just started a new game. I agree that the emphasis was formerly on getting off the starting planet and getting the warp drive working. It is now on building the first base. However, there really isn't any reason you couldn't just find a new planet after building the first structure. The portals do take away the feeling of "no going back" the game had at first. I don't know if these are bad things, just different. I do not agree that the planets get the same after a few hours. I'm 6 hours into the new game and I've seen a volcano planet, and ocean planet that kind of blew my mind. The ringed planets are pretty awesome. The Anomaly is pretty amazing now. Overall I'm enjoying it. It's not a totally different game, but it is different enough. More about building rather than reaching the center of the Galaxy. I guess since I have the launch disc I could play the vanilla version if I really wanted to. (I think it would work, just can't upload discoveries.)
    Hey you're entitled to your opinion. No worries. Feels like there is enough to do in the game that you never have to feel like you are stuck doing one thing. Just my opinion though.  I like to do different things and when I get bored I switch to something else. That's what I like about the game. I can build a base, reconfigure my freighter, run a settlement, hunt for new pets, or ships, and just do whatever I feel like at the time, no pressure.  If you prefer to always be exploring though I can understand the frustration seeing all these updates that seem to be focusing on everything else. Hopefully they'll add some more with the coming expedition.
    The problem is that the game went mainstream and the massive groups of players clamoured for all of these features. The devs then caved in to the demands, diluting their original vision.

So instead of focusing more on the procgren aspects and trying to get it to generate different stuff in different galactic regions to enhance the exploration aspects, they instead focussed on things like player bases etc.

It's not a bad game now, but it's not what was originally promised. Many many people are very happy with what it has become, and I do enjoy it as well, but I am also sad that the original idea has been lost. And I don't see any way of HG recapturing that original idea without having to undo a lot of what's been added in the meantime.

I guess the general gamer is just not interested in the type of game that HG originally wanted to create and the game got too big to stay niche during the hype up prior to launch.
Theyve earned it. With the latest update I can honestly say this game really feels complete. Like they filled the void for that last piece of science fiction we all wanted in a game. 😉
"Mostly Harmless"
Certainly deserves the dip after frontiers. The level of bugs was just awful. Settlements are still completely messed up on all of my saves.
While it's AMAZING to see all that has come to the game, at the same time, I'm a bit disappointed at losing the sense of isolation we used to have closer to launch.

It used to feel like you were alone in a remote part of the universe. Now it seems like there's always some ship zooming by you or if you take off, there's always some station nearby that filled with people from all over.
    At launch you still had ships flying over head. I remember because I thought..."is that a real player??" Haha 

The whole "missing the isiolation" thing is weird to me. You can still feel very isolated. Go to a planet and walk around. You are alone. Go to the space station, you are mostly alone. Just avoid the nexus and settlements. 

The feeling of isolation is definitely still there if you want it to be, now there's just other things to do and they made the game feel more alive.
        I guess if you don't go to the Nexus, you do avoid all of the people. But the space stations do still have lots of aliens coming and going.
            Yeah but the space stations are pretty much the same as launch. At launch you had ships coming and going as well, and you still had venders and stuff. Now you just have a bit more.
I tried it about 1 year ago but i find the controls of the ship outdated. Maybe i am too spoiled with Battlefront 2 fly mechanics.
    Yes, the standard flight controls suck. I specifically bought an Elite Series 2 and configured the small left under-paddle to be the brake and the small right under-paddle to be acceleration. I also configured the left trigger to be change weapon and the right to be fire weapon. I called this setup Spaceship mode and also programmed a Spacesuit mode for when I leave my ship. In this setup the left small under-paddle is sprint and the right small under-paddle is jetpack. After playing this way for a year and a half my flying skills are truly a sight to behold. It was worth every penny of the $180 cost, but with the drawback of only being useful on XBOX or PC (bluetooth enabled).
not deserved at all, the game is still very disappointing
The original game should never be forgotten for how manipulative marketing and unfair deadlines can kill reputation.

&#x200B;

If someone were to play the game now with only the promises of the original then I would say with certainty that they would still be disappointed.

&#x200B;

However, I place blame where it should go which is the publisher for not helping them temper expectations and not providing them with more help. When Sony was helping them fund the game, it was almost certain that the game would be despised by the reception even before the game came out.

&#x200B;

To this day I do not understand why Sean had to go out there himself and explain things to a crowd about mechanics they were still unsure about. Hindsight is 20 20 but there must have been a discussion about his lack of experience presenting games.

&#x200B;

I am 100% confident that the game would have been abandoned by Sony if they were the ones directly working on the project.

&#x200B;

I did not put 100 hours into this game because of the promises of what the game would be but what it is now. I didn't need the flashing presentations to encourage me to get the game. What did was their willingness to work on something they believed in when almost no one else did.

&#x200B;

To this day I am astounded by the amount of progress made on the game from the barren wastes to the now far more substantial experience.

&#x200B;

Surely it will improve further from here and frankly, the rest of the games industry looks less and less attractive to me the more I play the game.

# TLDR

I love games and this has opened my eyes as to how a game can evolve. We shouldn't forget what this game has gone through and it will happen again. We should not forget the level of faith in an idea that Sean and Hello Games had in their vision that, even to this day, they work on it stil.

&#x200B;

Keep up the good work on the wildest redemption story in videogaming.
    HG set the timeline, Sony was blindsided as well.

It’s all been covered before, huge ambitions and Sean not being the best PR person set the stage for that drama.
        I see. Fair enough and still a good lesson about scope and PR
            Totally agree. NMS gave me a great lesson about pre-ordering games. 

I was so tempted to get cyber punk, but this taught me better.

I’ll probably download NMS again and give it another shot, if it’s so much better, I will be happy to change my review.
                It's so weird because I thought I would hate this game but a different game gave me a fresh perspective on this one.



After I played a game called Starbound I thought maybe it would be my kind of game. That and the famous internet historian video on the whole thing piqued my interest and here we are 100 hours later.
                    After no man sky, and drama on the release, I got lost into a game called Dying Light,  l’ve got about 300 hours in that game and I don’t think no man sky is ever going to come close to that playtime lol
                I have been a real expensive headlight....

            I’d argue that his hard work with his team afterwards it’s worth some forgiveness. Mind you I got burned by the game as well at launch. 

5 years us enough, and it’s an old game by now.
                [deleted]
                    Hey man, don’t get it misconstrued, if you go to my history you will see that I’m arguing with a NMS fanboy right now about his allegiance to a game that didn’t deliver.

I hate that this happened, I hate that an indie games was marketed as a AAA game, I hate the lies, I hate how bad their PR was when the game launched by them going radio silent for six months, and you better believe I was on all the forums talking about this game and this company.

But I already bought the game. And a PR team isn’t a development team, someone had to do the work to make a better game and in a lot of ways I’m glad that they did. 

In all honesty, I’ll download it again, play it for a few hours, get bored because it’s probably the same thing over and over again, and then uninstall it for a newer, more promising game. 

But I’m never gonna buy anything else from hello games, I just remark that work has been put into the game but I am no longer supporting this company. But work has been done.
            Hey, don't agitate Sean's cult. You must jerk him off daily and totally forgot about the time when he lied and scammed everyone.
    No mans sky was 100% self funded and self published. Everything that went wrong was decided by sean and his wife as they own hg
I know I am in the minority here (and will get down voted to hell) but I think Frontiers is boring. I DO NOT think it is bad by any means. Just boring ***to me***.

If you dig building settlements and such then this DLC is for you. But it does not add anything to the lore, or really much to any other part of the game.

And that's cool. I mean I'm happy with that. I'm still playing the game.

What I am waiting for is more lore, more story, more mystery, more danger, etc, etc. . Or if this DLC gets expanded to were other players can rent space in your settlement - things like that - that would perk my interests. But just manage a settlement? Hell I got FO4 for that in spades.
    From the description of the upcoming 3rd expedition I think your wishes might come true. As has been pointed out by multiple people : this is, surprisingly, only  version 3.6x and not the expected 4.0 ...
Doesn't surprise me a little cult support haa been formed after the massive circlejerk against it the initial launch. Does make one wonder whether it deserved so much attention in the first place.
So basically, more and more people who actually like Hello Games' idea are actually playing it, rather than the people who literally hate everything about it.

Does that mean Sony is going to put back the planet rotation, wide planet system distribution, difference in atmosphere thickness, and variety in general, now?

Or are they going to insist that the game was broken and unplayable to begin with, and that it's only through reducing the whole thing to bland, automatic and endless grinding with no reprieve anywhere, that finally made the game get better ratings?

It is a /mystery/ what Sony's publishing spawn are going to go with on this one.
    >reducing the whole thing to bland, automatic and endless grinding with no reprieve anywhere, 

What game you talking about, wow? That channel is -> way.
        I know it's been made less extreme over time. But NMS is still oriented around substantial grinding for resources, repeating very repetitive random encounters. And continously finding the upgrade slots so you can store these resources that you actually need to produce fuel. Just to take off without entering the atmosphere requires fuel, etc. (although cruising endlessly requires no fuel at all). The repetitive nature of the systems, the layouts of the systems, and the predictability of what you're going to find does not help in any way.

At one time, before Sony's beta-people got their hands on it, the game had a different approach: you did not need to grind. You would search out some planet, and the planet would very likely have an upgrade of some kind. If you needed a different resource, traveling the system might be a 20-30minute trek. And then you would get some sort of upgrade along the way, in way of ship or suit improvement, etc. But the game was oriented around getting to the next system, each system being a different challenge to get further.

That game is still under there, but your progress is measured in numbers and storage space, not in progress through the galaxy-map.

Some people prefer that. And they're very loud, and were certainly that during the initial launch of the game. But what is the case is that the game Hello Games made is still kind of an idea that isn't realized, thanks to a set of astonishingly bad tweaks that made a game about exploration into a game about bigger numbers. That part of the game is astonishingly boring - but the game is still played, because of the aesthetic, and the feeling of exploration. In spite of that all the mechanics-changes are trying to avoid that experience.

I'm just pointing out that now, by and large - which is a view that was violently opposed at launch - more people than average play this game for the exploration feel, rather than the .. well.. grinding resources to put into their home-base, so they can dispense with the whole exploration altogether, and just get bigger and bigger numbers.

And that's not strange - because there are a billion games out there that does this type of grinding much better and more addictive.

Not that Sony is ever going to see that - their people will suggest things like this: the grinding mechanics are made enjoyable and addictive, because of the aesthetic and the universe around it. It could all be replaced with a cutscene - all the tech involved is completely superfluous, all the work involved is utterly wasted. But that's how this game is, and really has been since right before launch.

Mission accomplished, if you're working at Sony, obviously.
Till this game has an ACTUAL, GOOD STORY, I will not bother picking it back up
Only took 10yrs of constant upgrades to make it, meh.  I had high hopes for this game but so far its just "pretty". Im glad theyre at least TRYING to make it better though, after ripping off so many people.
    10 years???
        Is it longer? I feel like its longer. Honestly i was one of the suckers who bought it on release and have downloaded and played it every time they update it.  So far, they have done a great job upgrading it, but its still a far cry from what they advertised it to be.
            Are you joking? It's been around five years.
                Feels like much much longer.  5yrs though? Really? I couldve sworn this game came out like 2012.
                    You're definitely joking. The screenshot of Steam literally says it came out in 2016.
After having been there for the launch, nothing they will ever do, can make me give them another chance.

Biggest shitshow of a launch I’ve seen, don’t think we’ll ever see such a launch from such a wanted game ever again.
    Ahhh... Cyperpunk 2077. 

And if you hate this game so much, why are you here?
        Cyberpunks launch was far better than No Mans Sky's lol, it's not even a comparison
            It wasn't. NMS actually went on to fix it for free, CP2077 didn't.
                NMS also ran when it launched. Yes it was buggy as hell. And no it didn't have anywhere what was promised. But CP2077 didn't run at all on most consoles. Barely ran on PC. And nothing that was promised what in the game. 

So yeah NMS and CP2077 had HORRIBLE launches filled with lies and bullshit. But Hello Games came through. I can't say as much for CDPR. Their last "update" was trash. 

As a final thought.. if you don't like the game why are you here?
                That's post launch, but NMS definitely has done a really good job post launch, much better than Cyberpunk so far.  


That's besides the point though
    Why are you here?

            I'll use the same format as you, because apparently you read and understand it better :

It.Was.Hype.

a couple of month before the game released people were taking Sean Murray's (definitely stupid) words and interpreting in them things he never even said. Tons of idiots (can't use anything else, sorry) here thought that "every atom procedural" meant that all assets in NMS would be computer generated ... not that every visual would be composed of manually created assets. I mean .. how fucking dumb must you be?! 

I even wrote a comment saying that people would be thoroughly disappointed at release if they expected stuff that (still is) technologically impossible, and I got downvoted to minus heighty something.

so, again, Sean Murray didn't help, but 

IT.WAS.HYPE.

Multiplayer was "kind of" in game. https://massivelyop.com/2016/08/10/no-mans-sky-the-non-multiplayer-multiplayer-game/ (sadly the clip has been removed), but I'm sure you can "literally find videos" of what was happening. Finding this link took me exactly 23 seconds.

"The galaxies with real physics and orbit just like real life!" were deliberately scrapped for a much more SciFi'esk and *enjoyable* unrealistically close-knit approach. if you want to "fly" a make-belief spaceship for 45 minutes while watching netflix because that's all you can do during the flight, then by all means play E:D.

your clip is Sean Murray speaking out of his ass indeed, but most of what he says was actually in game (the whole chemical elements you can mix together to get something else) or has been allegedly scraped for *fun*'s sake (like the realistic astronomy).  Notice how he often uses "would" instead of "will" ... that's Sean Murray saying what might one day be possible, you pathetic excuse for a microscopically-brained-primate.

Learn to read and listen .. and maybe try to wrap your head around the fact that English is not everyone's first language ... Du blödes, stupides, unglaublich borniertes mutterfickendes Arschloch. Putain de merde! T'es con comme une porte de prison?!?

                who got scammed?
I pulled my negative review once the VR came up.

I will never give it a positive review, though (or any review at this point). It appears they did good fixing the game, compared to the state it released it. I have not really played it since release, but at least there was an effort to right the wrongs.

I will never buy another Hello Games product, regardless. The radio silence after release was the most indefensible thing I have ever seen a videogame developer do. Good for them for fixing a broken product. But no amount of goodwill will win me back.

&#x200B;

Edit: Oh no. So many downvotes. I guess I can't be honest on this sub. Maybe I should post a negative review. Nah. Keep downvoting, just being honest. Glad you guys are enjoying the game.  :)
    The radio silence after release was, in hindsight, exactly what they should have done (and did). Sean Murray is definitely not a PR-mastermind and anything they could have said would have been dissected and probably been vilified AND hyped (though not by the same people;).

They did what they do best : working on the update instead of talking about it.
Undeserved really. There are still bugs, glitches and generally annoying things that have been in the game since launch, yet they spend most of their time and effort on adding pointless, game breaking updates that no one asked for.
    Lol except for *all the people* asking for the updates. In case you haven’t noticed, HelloGames have built a huge, supportive fan base through their approach to NMS. Maybe you don’t like it, but that doesn’t mean everyone else feels the same. This kind of poo-poo’ing is basically the “stop having fun” meme.
    [deleted]
    Many people do ignore that the Anomaly and the Freighter systems are completely bugged, tbh
I mean it deserves the good reviews now but the people who gave it good reviews on launch were/are deluded because it was absolutely one of the worst lies in the history of gaming lol. Sean and his team spent months hyping up this game to be something it wasn't.

I remember Sean saying that one of the devs had designed some shit about atoms or molecules, like... fuck off, it's a game.

So yeah, the game was truly garbage at launch but it's getting better now and now it deserves the good reviews.
    That uh wasn't a lie, the NMS periodical table was a very real thing
Only took what 8 years...
    The game released 5 years ago, not 8
        3 years of development, 5 years of testing.
I was disappointed in the original game and tried to go back last month. There was way too much leaning curve.
Doesn't deserve it. Exploration has turned to shit with every planet looking the same. They're all so ugly and boring with no vivid and alien like colors on them.
Mostly
    They mostly come out at night... mostly
Cyberpunk, why can't you be like your older brother No Man's Sky
🍻🎉
The first few months killed the rating for sure. In not saying the negative reviews were unwarranted, but if you look at the reviews after the first few months the overall rating would likely be close to overwhelmingly positive. 

I wonder how many people who left a negative review early on have played the game in the last couple of years and what their thoughts would be now.
We did it!!! Yeah!!
I don't know... Mine is still crashing randomly on PS5
    What you get for playing on console.
        Rich comment, considering that usually it's the PC versions that are plagued by this sort of issues.  

Played on PC for a while but this is one of those games where I like to sit back on the sofa and relax whilst playing.
Congratulations Hello Games!
Steam reviews are rigged for the games, so it better be.
And what it had before? "Mixed"?
we did it, guys. Sean would be proud.
As explained by [Internet Historian](https://youtu.be/O5BJVO3PDeQ) it's been a long journey. I'm glad to see they're doing well. Now where are my Tali mods?
Firm handshakes everyone!
I have refunded this game 2 times in the past, now I am more than ever sure this is what I have been waiting for. It was a bumpy road but now this game deserves all the praise and full price.
I got mns about a year ago and took a break but am so excited to get back into it
talk about a turn around it was shit at first but then became good
Well deserved and there's room for more even!
Prob because unlike respawn and the ddos nms has love and support nowadays
Wow, well done, they deserve it. 

It took 5 years to finally break out of "mixed", that was a long road.
I started yesterday and am loving every second of the game.
Crazy how long that took despite the game being good for over 4 years.  Never hype a game, no matter what.  It has only the potential to destroy it.
The game description at this photo most probably refers to the game before the release.
very proud of them. looking for no mans sky 2 now.
I just bought the game a few days ago! happy to be playing and also happy I waited out and am getting this fresh experience! What a dope game I’m so glad they kept working on it
It looks so great on the PS5! The detail rendering and load times are phenomenal!
Nice
The moment when the game had a creative mode, was THE moment I knew that I'm definitely loving this game.
*no guy buy
The last statement means a lot too. They could have just left it as it was, walked away from the game as millionaires, and gone on to make the last campfire or another game to sell for more money (for whoever would be willing to buy it at that point). 

But instead they made NMS better and basically made it into a whole new game, saving their reputation and ensuring better sales for whatever comes next knowing we can still trust them after their redemption.
    This is really important to remember.

The UK has a really transparent attitude to business. You can go right now and check Hello Games figures.

They have an operating profit margin of >70%

In 2019 their total sales for was 18m with a profit margin of 76%, or 13.59m GBP in PROFIT. For a company of 20 people, that's absurd.

In 2019 they literally have 70m GBP in the bank. 70m!! Company of 20 people. That's insane.

[https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06663645/filing-history](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06663645/filing-history)
        Wow. That's a lot of money.

Let's hope that translates to NMS updates years into the future!
            It absolutely does. You often see people here saying "they can charge for the next DLC and I'll pay!", but the reality is they can make the game for 10 years from now without making a single penny in revenue, and still have money in the bank at the end.
                Pretty cool job for life!  I'm glad they're sticking at it.
                Nah fam, they're literally never gonna have to worry about money ever again. All they have to do is invest even a decent chunk of that money properly, and then they can do whatever they want from there, for the rest of their lives.

If I had 70 mil / 20 people, I'd make updates for NMS forever, or as long as was practical, and do it at a leisurely pace without ruining my health or general well being as the game development sector often does. (Due to virtually non-existent employee protections.)

And yeah, that'd be a dream come true. Just being able to play your passion for the rest of your life without destroying your interest due to 'necessity'. Plus the game continues to put out because more updates = more new players.

Can you imagine? It's crazy how they completely leaned into their rather abysmal failure and turned it into a resounding success. The hilarious part is that what they promised and failed to deliver at the beginning, is now completely possible because they have all the time in the world to just work on this game in any way they please.
                    if they invest in a good wallet of companies, real state, etc. 10mil they get easily enough to pay everyone there every month a good amount of money. they could use part of that money to help other small game companies make their games a reality. if the game is really good they could just add those people to their company and let them make the game as a Hello Games IP.
                The funny this is I never seen this for other companies except for fromsoft where people will buy the dlcs as soon they come out. I would gladly buy their dlcs just to support them. But since we get it for free I wish they implement some way to support them more.
        Okay holy shit. Now I see why they don't have paid DLCs or anything like that. Like, they literally don't need that much money. I also heard that Sean pays himself surprisingly little considering that he's the boss. 

Also, I knew Hello Games was small but - 20 people?? Ubisoft has 19,000 lmao
            Props to Sean
                Absolutely. He has put together one hell of a team!
        that is why the updates are free. that makes you think why The Sims is like it is... you need to pay like 800USd to play the game with all the things it has now
        One of the reasons they have so much money now is because they had losses earlier got a bunch of tax refunded
            That's not how that works lol

If you make losses and get tax refunded, you don't end up with 70m pound in the bank. Read the documents, it covers their revenue. They're making 15m a year with outgoing of less than 3. That's why they have 70m cash on hand.
                I did read their statements, did you? Its in note 8.

They made $4 million and $5 million in the past 2 years respectively due to government tax credits/grants
        No, that's faith in your vision. On the opposite side of the coin you get Star Citizen - which is faith in other's gullibility.

Sean and Hello Games... congratulations on NMS 5th birthday, pulling out of the dread Steam spiral o'doom, and my personal thanks for 3+ years of in-game enjoyment- long may it continue!
    This. Even if I don't see myself playing their next project (for whatever reason), I will still purchase it out of pure support.
    still a little terrifying though that an indie studio can literally sell such a piece of shit to begin with, with full backing from bigger studio, including late night tv spots and massive amounts of fan love for what it was said to be... only for it to be what was initially released? 

i'm really happy they changed it, it would have been fine the way it was if it wasn't falsely advertised. but that false advertisement made them millionaires, them making it whole shouldn't undo the mistakes, most devs wouldn't have even had the chance to become millionaires with the game they released to begin with.

so they basically ended up where they said they would be and it took them 5 extra years with millions in advance, which would be the dream for any new dev.

a smaller man would have ran away with it (and seemingly did...). but good on them for continuing until it was up to the standard they said it would  be.
        Its been the game it was supposed to be since 2018, everything included since then has been extra and free for the last 3 years now. 

I also believe in redemption, clearly you don't I guess. 

>them making it whole shouldn't undo the mistakes

It's not undoing any mistake. Their reputation went to absolute shit for 5 years. It's only just now getting better, after years of basically working for free. Almost like a prison sentence, or at least being put on community service. They "did their time". What more do you exactly want?

5 years ago did you want their studio cancelled and closed as if that would have made the better outcome? Cancel culture... I swear...
            > Cancel culture... I swear...

Reddit: "Fucking cancel culture is ruining everything!"

Cashier: "Sir, this is a McDonalds..."
            >	I also believe in redemption, clearly you don't I guess

People are allowed to be mad, they put out a game then went radio silent for a couple of months after they got called out on its status. 

Honestly though, this sub at that time of turmoil was way better than the game! The drama was too damn good!
                I don’t get people being mad at all, honestly. Disappointed? Sure, but not mad. Correct me if I’m wrong but most people who didn’t like the game upon release could get refunded their money, so what did they lose? Faith in a good game being made? Sure, but that seems like a very immature thing to be mad over. And even more, and immature thing to hold against them. 
Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Eh, anyone can feel however they want, but the game has been spectacular for a few years now, and has just been getting better, in my opinion. I also feel like anyone who’s still upset about it’s release needs to grow up. But that just my personal feelings about it all.
                    > Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Not in this age. A tweet doesn’t cost 12 hours and a lot of man hours to put out.  Especially when they were developing the game and they were tweeting all over the place up until the launch. How does that make sense?

Immature to hold against them? They are a company that delivered a product that was poor. If you’re new to gaming, you must be new to the complaints  gamers have about all sorts of products. It is not immature to want the features they promised.

It would be immature and naïve to assume game developers shouldn’t communicate with their consumers. Who doesn’t do that? 

As much as I hate Todd Howard, he delivered a better game with Skyrim. And when it came out buggy, they communicated and fixed it which is why that game is legendary and no man sky will be only legendary for fixing a mistake.

Hell even this announcement is odd isn’t it? Like they are on the special because they are fixing a problem, no other reason. That’s a low bar.

Also as a gaming consumer, you don’t want to get developers in this habit of delivering piss poor products with the promise of fixing it much later.
                        This was a game that got too hyped up because of communicating too much. A game that had high hopes that couldn’t be met with their resources and time. I think radio silence was the smartest move for them. 

Yes, it’s immature to hold a grudge on a small dev group that is clearly trying to make a game they love. I understand that they didn’t give what was promised but honestly? It doesn’t fucking matter. They’re trying their hardest to improve the game and it’s better now than it ever could have been at launch, and it has nothing to do with promises or talking to their fan base, but simply caring about their product. 

No Man’s Sky may be legendary to you only for fixing a mistake, but that’s not the case for everyone. They made a mediocre glitchy game to start and then built upon it. I’m sorry that you can’t move past what it was, but some of us can. 

I’ll die on the hill that living with grudges and always holding mistakes above peoples heads forever is immature, and shows a lack of growth in character. 

You can feel however you want about this game but anger is an immature emotion to feel about something so inconsequential as a video game. I’ve never felt angry when a game fails to live up to its expectations and promises because I know how hard being an artist is. No matter how grand the idea, it’s only as good as how you execute it. 

They had a bad launch but I believe wholeheartedly that every step that they’ve taken since then has been the right one. They’ve redeemed themselves, and they kept going. 

Also, I don’t think that I fully agree with your final statement. I think that a game as vast and exploration based as NMS benefits from being released as a base and then being built upon. I think if they had thought of doing it that way initially, they could’ve made the base game better, admittedly, but used that foundation to do what they’ve done, which I think is ultimately successful and a relatively reasonable model. I think it’s a very stagnant mindset to expect everything to work the same way all the time, and anything that diverts from the standard flow is unacceptable. 

They’ve done well, regardless of what you think, and deserve every bit of praise that they get. But we’re allowed to disagree, otherwise, this world would be a rather stagnant place, no?
                Sure they are, no-one said they aren't allowed to be mad. But after they've more than made up for it by now, it make them look childish and immature to not be capable for moving on.
                    I mean that’s what people did, they moved on. The game came out in 2016, and lots video games have been coming out that have been phenomenal since then, with better releases and without drama.

I would argue it kind of hurts the industry to not give those developers props for better releases.
                        ??? one company being commended for providing free updates and fixing and expanding their game beyond the original vision doesn't mean other developers aren't getting props for their release. That doesn't make any sense. I'm getting the feeling you haven't even played the game since release to be honest.
                            Beyond their original vision? No man, this is their vision realized.

And  I think you’re confusing “free” updates with “required” updates. as in hello games required these updates if they ever wanted to function as a game company ever again. 

Their reputations were on the line,  and no one is bound to play a bad game in hopes of it getting better. 

Hello game situation is unique, but in most cases developers would walk away. Someone who had a bad launch knows that players are going to leave to play other games.

Have you been stuck on this game since 2016? Think about how many awesome games you may have missed. Games that were already done at launch. 

Doesn’t seem silly to risk that for another bad launch? what if another video game has a horrible launch, do you have to play it through and wait until they improve it? I’d argue hell no you don’t.

Don’t be a fan boy, be a good consumer.
                                Remember that itemized list of everything promised that was missing from launch? Yea back when the NEXT update came out, they pulled that list out and 95% of it was done...

Infact majority of the games features it has now wasn't even something they promised (some were even things they said would never be in). So yea... that does count as beyond their original vision.

Obviously i haven't only played this game since 2016, this isn't about saying launch nms was fine, it was broken af. This is about saying "awesome! They gave us what was promised and then some. What a great turn of events".

Like seriously, how hard of a concept is it for you to understand that?

What i can't understand is why someone who holds such a grudge against this game keeps coming back to the reddit. Like, you talk about missing out on other games but here you are wasting your time airing your grievance about how the game was 5 years ago 5 years later.

If that isn't the definition of pathetic, idk what is. Just "move on" already ffs
its a long way from what its potential is. we need upgrades on many facets to the game still.
How is it for new players?
I would like to see a steam chart based on “recent” reviews, I bet NMS would be high on that list
    Recent reviews have actually gone down a few % since frontiers, at least that what I saw when I checked if it's mostly positive yet. Not sure why that is tho. Currently recent reviews are on 92%, there are plenty of games higher than that.
        New major update means a lot of bugs. These bugs get fixed really fast but most of the people try out the game right after the update and see these bugs and quit immediately leaving a review "buggy game bad" and don't touch it again.
            I think its more about the mobile game gameplay with 4 hours of waiting time for each part on buildings.
                4 hours, not 2 weeks (very common for mobile games to have wait beyond that), also you cant skip the wait with Micro Transactions. I just think its so people don't grind all the content in one long marathon (which would be very not fun, this kind of content is meant to be segmented over time to be fun)
                    I think the problem is that the system works well as a sort of side feature during normal gameplay, but a lot of players are at "end game." Having a timer to check up on your settlement is fine when you have the main quest and other side quests and other timers from the base building questline and are upgrading your equipment...

When you're at the point where your main objective is just going where the solar wind takes you, and the solar wind takes you to this new settlement feature and it can't just be the thing you're doing, that's when it becomes frustrating. Which is why we should be able to pump some kind of resource or units or nanites or something to speed up the process.
                        They should have just made it so that it takes a lot more resources to upgrade each building. That way new players will have another thing to work towards and end game players will have something to dump their resources into. The whole waiting time thing is just AIDS.
                        The problem is that parts of buildings are split up so you have to go back multiple times. It should be one interaction and then you go away for however many hours, come back and it's finished.
                            Or have each part be immediately interactable with their own timers. So if you have the supplies for the frame but not the roof, you can start construction on that part while you get the other materials. If you have everything you need, you can start construction on all parts and have them all be done in an hour or whatever.
                    A few complaints I have heard are mainly regarding the time gating from streamer friends, they want to stream the new content and stuff, but end up just doing older content because of the gating. Makes it a very hard update to stream and showcase content, and these guys are space billionaires so it's not like they missed any content previously.
                        I dont really want game mechanics dictated by whats easier for streamers. I want the developers to think about what's best for the gameplay and the mechanics. I'm not saying whether or not they should change the time gating or not but it absolutely shouldn't be so streamers have more content and can make more money, it should be whatever makes the game more fun for the average player.
                            I get what you are saying, but as a non-streamer I absolutely hate time gates
                                I'm not disagreeing with that at all. I just think making design choices based on streamers preferences is not a good way to go about deciding how the mechanics of games work.

Edit: wording
                            Whether anyone likes it or not, streamers are an important aspect that has to be considered from a development and community standpoint. More and more, streamers are becoming a determining factor in a long-term health and viability.
                    4 hours two weeks it does not matter tbh. The problem is that you had to wait to throw almost nothing in there then you have to wait again. During the 12 hour total session it takes i could have built 100 similar landing pad. In a game if its not mobile game idling timers are just stupid and unnecessary. The game supposed to engage the player and not to make them go away and then come back for 3 minutes to perform a click just to wait another 4 hours.
Make the settlement building engaging. Force the player (By making actuall high rsc needs for buildings) to either actually grind the resources for the building or buy it. Atleast we would have some use for units after buying our dream ships and freighter.
                    Better then having to wait a year to have your city completed. You should be able to speed it up atleast with batteries or some shit.
                        Seriously. It's painful seeing my settlement just get farther and farther into debt faster than things can build.
                            I'm not having the same experience. I'm on my 7th building and my debt is only about 175k. I did choose mostly production boosting buildings first off. So the income is healthy.

Also I went to multiple settlements and looked at stats before claiming one. My first was just a test run just to figure out mechanics. Found and claimed a new one shortly after.
                                I also looked at about a dozen or so and couldn't find one better than C class.
            Yeah, Steam reviews just aren't very reliable. In my experience the bugs mostly have to do with textures loading in, definitely nothing that constitutes a negative review. (especially in a world where games like Cyberpunk and ARK exist)

Granted I waited until friday to play the update, but that's when it went on sale anyways (I've had the game since Origins), and thus when all the new people flooded in.
            Or perhaps we don't like the game as it is today? P
        Because the new update turned the game into a buggy mess, combined with the fact that the new update gave the game a lot of exposure on steam so that many new players had their first day in game being just after it was broken by frontiers...

It's not hard to see how that would farm you some negative reviews.

They *really* need to be fixing the rest of what was broken sooner rather than later. Combining the game's high exposure days with it's high bug count days isn't good.
How did it lose over 1,000 negative reviews between 2020 and 2021?
    I never tried writing Steam reviews so I'm not sure if that's allowed, but my guess is people changed their old negative reviews to positive.
        I’m one of those. Once Frontiers made the universe feel alive I really felt like we’d come full circle and changed my review. 

Also I’d kind of forgotten I’d rated it negatively back when it launched. I’m glad I reinstalled!!
        That's absolutely allowed. Steam won't let you add a second review but will let you edit an old one or delete it. I recently changed my review of another game from recommended to not recommended due to what the asinine developers are doing to that game.
            Should I ask what game that is?
                I immediately thought "world of warcraft" lol... i know it's not but it fits the description lol
                    I got into wow again a month before the whole shitshow happened and was keen to play it, then just stopped subbing. Hope blizzard sorts their shit out
                        Yeah I did too. I rerolled, leveled my Alliance (the ratio is another mess) char up. Just got into the Maw for the first time and started to noticed less and less of the guild was online. I asked,, and unsubbed.
            What game is that, so I can avoid it too!
        There was quite a big campaign on the subreddit here reminding people to change their reviews.
        Just seems odd that it happened all at the same time and it didn’t happen before.
            Maybe a big update came out? Origins came out in September 2020, and I remember everyone saying "now we've finally got the game they'd promised" and "NMS is finally good".
                Don't forget covid struck. A lot of people may have started playing again after not for a long time do to quarantine and found the improvements.
                    Oh yeah, I forgot about Covid

...is a phrase that most people probably won't say for a while...

but I actually did.
                        Amnesia one of the side-effects. :-D
                            Nah man, that a different game series. /s
                        I keep forgetting that its been a fucking year since it started. It feels like that shit started like 4 or 5 months ago
                            I feel you man it's been a long 2020
                            We're approaching two years.

And I would hold onto my pants, because due to various circumstances I won't bother getting into, doesn't seem like it will be going away for a while.

Nerds truly did inherit the Earth when the COVID-19 update was released for Life.
            I can be wrong, but it seems to be aligned with the Origins release (Sept 2020). Which would make sense, as this was (in my book) by far the best update.
                The down tick started in the beginning of 2020, Origins released September 2020.
        You can redo your review at any time as long as you have the game.
        You can indeed change your review later.
    Likely to be people switching their original negative review to a positive one :)
        That’s normal but to that extreme fluctuation isn’t do they get those statistics solely from Steam reviews?
            Like people said above it's probably just because of an update which reminded them to change their review. As for Steam250 I believe they pull all their live data directly from Steam reviews
            "Extreme fluctuation?" It's 1,000 reviews of nearly 50,000 negative reviews. That's barely 2%.
    I'm one who was disappointed until the [engoodening of no man's sky](https://youtu.be/O5BJVO3PDeQ). Honestly it's now not even what I want to play, not the game I wanted, but before it was pretty much empty and repetitive. It's still probably that way too some degree but without any additional money it's become a real fully featured game with great developers who care about the product and people. That's worth my respect at least.
        They definitely made it into a 60$ game, when it came it it definitely wasn’t which is pretty much proven by the fact the active players a day went from a quarter of a million to the hundreds in less than two months on Steam.
    Change your review.
    Maybe covid. Lots of free time not leaving the house equals more people playing games they wouldn't?

I know that I finally played an MMO during my lockdown and also finally figured out how monster hunter works, never would have done either if I was able to leave the house
The price history is also very interesting. It goes on to 50% off quite often, more often than I thought honestly.
    Always goes on sale at update time. Often does it during steam sales too.
        I know that, I just mean it goes on sale way more often than the game updates. Did you even look at it? It went on sale 7 times this year alone. There has not been 7 updates this year.
We're accelerating!
I like how there is a hefty amount of positive reviews even at start.  Many players saw potential despite all that drama and hate back then. Maybe this is why NMS have such strong and wholesome community.
What a strange graph. At first glance it looks like there are more positive reviews than total.
I'd have to get it on Steam to rate it here. I have it on my PC through the Microsoft store. Xbox Play Anywhere!
    Offer it to a friend !
        Would we be able to play together if we were on separate sources?
            You can, but voice communication would be difficult. I’ve had to play with my step son on his Xbox and me on pc while he uses discord on his tablet
                Couldn’t you just use the Xbox app on your Pc? 

I do that to play Forza with a friend who is on Xbox
                    Oh... I never thought of that. I have everything Xbox disabled because it was Messing with rocket league a while back and I had forgotten that I had it. Great idea
                        It’s not the best platform on PC but it’s much simpler for the other party, and sound quality should be better than on a tablet.
                            I imagine that a headset can be pluged as on a phone, or with a usb OTG.
                That's what Discord is for! 😁
            About all I read you can play cross platform, there is no cross save game (xbox to PS to PC)

[Edited] thx for the GOG multiplayer info.
                [deleted]
                    Good to know ! It was not like this before, i was stuck in the past !
                Yeah GOG is weird with high-end games like this. So is Epic Games. Though EG is somewhat less so.
                    [Outdated]
I'm going to wait and see what they do about the most recent update, because it broke the game for many of us and wasn't much fun for many who it did work for.
I’d say defrauding consumers and lying to the public about your product to use early adopters as involuntary kickstarters reason enough to keep “mixed” for some time.
    Thanks for your input, u/SniffMyRapeHole
        Lol wtf
        That guy's comment was decidedly not r/rimjob_steve material
    You can blame the publisher for pushing the developers to release an unfinished game. 

The devs have been doing a lot to make the game what they promised and I feel they deserve the comeback. It’s a fun game that exceeded my expectations when I picked it up last year.
        And Sony for promoting what was essentially an indie game as a big triple A release. No way it could've lived up to expectations at launch
    I get where you're coming from. HG messed up and were complete noobs when it came to PR, but that doesn't mean they don't deserve to redeem themselves. For some reason there's people who's values will not allow them to forgive them no matter the fixes and content inclusions *just* because of what happened half a decade ago.

But what's equally as weird as people legitimately upset that it's not rated "overwhelmingly positive" due to how much they like this game when there's clearly issues with it. Apart from basic bugs and polish, the major complaint from people who don't like the game has been that the gameplay loop doesn't push you to do anything.
        That the gameplay loop isn't a thing and isn't pushing me to do anything is precisely why I love the game. There are a million games I can play to linearly progress through a bunch of pre-determined series of events, and that's been more or less the definition of a video game for decades. It's nice to have an endless expanse and lots of options for things to do where I can just relax and go about whatever I please at whatever pace suits my energy/attention levels in that moment.
            Booooooo. Honestly I've rated the game down for its lack of depth and boring gameplay loop. People like you who defend that and say "actually less is more" are terrifying to me as you allow companies to get away with the absolute bare minimum. Let me elaborate.. 

A sandbox game is great if only two things are accomplished 

1. The player is given fun toys. NMS has done this.

2. The game has given players ways to utilize these toys. NMS has not done this.

This results in an aimless gameplay loop where the player can get "stuff" but there is nothing to do with said "stuff". For example.. You can get a mech. Awesome. What can you do with mech? What practical application is there? Does it allow you to do something you could not do before, like go to a special planet or get a special item? We know the answer obviously, but this is the depth issue that NMS suffers from.

Not to mention to be a game *centered* around exoration, the exploration *sucks* in this game. Once you've seen 5 planets you've effectively seen them all. There is no real sense of exploration, no matter where you go. Just big rolling hills, deep chasms the look ugly as sin 99% of time and a static sea level. No changes in biome, unique geographical features, just the same boring terrain over and over again. The most exciting terrain you'll find is maybe some under sea caves, but that's about it. Now go play valheim and be amazed by what proc gen can accomplish. Rolling meadows, dense mysterious forest and rivers, towering mountain peaks, and vast swamps. 

Hello Games have actually done very little to improve NMS. Most of these updates are useless fluff that adds buggy, half thought out features to the game that nobody cares about or asked for. Then like clock work the sycophants howl on Twitter praising hello games for never giving up, despite the game being announced live service on launch, and pretending like riding on animals or exploring boring derelict freighters are what was missing from this turd turning into a polished gem stone. Multiplayer is still buggy and useless, missions are ab-so-lutely crap, the "story" is a jumbled mess of incomprehensible pseudo-intellectualism that is presented in the most un inspired lazily way (another hot take, its similar to foullout 76's format of telling the story through "chasing ghost" except even that game had some sense to add good environmental story telling to keep it from being boring).

I know I'm going to get downvoted to hell, but honestly your comment just really bothers me. You all are so willing to except such a sub par product and put it on such a high pedestal.. its like looking at a cult.
                > You all are so willing to except such a sub par product and put it on such a high pedestal.. its like looking at a cult.

This is exactly how I feel every time I read any of the Nintendo or Nintendo game subs. 

Really don't understand how some game developers get absolutely crucified for making even the tiniest mistake but others can get away with doing the bare minimum or less and be praised for it. 

I wouldn't say your critique of NMS is entirely fair but overall I agree with the sentiment.
                    I totally agree! Nintendo bugs the hell out of me too! They absolutely get by doing the bare minimum.
                Hey, calm down maybe? The fact that it terrifies you and enrages you that different people like different things than you do is borderline sociopathy. You've got a lot of growing to do to be able to accept that not everyone is going to fit your cookie cutter shape, and that's OK, because there are other shapes and they are great too in their own way.
                    Hearing critiscm about a game prompts you to call the critic a sociopath? That's very healthy behavior. I never once insulted you, I just gave a very well thought out opinion. Maybe you should relaxe and re evaluate some things.
    I think they’ve more than made up for it
    It’s been 5 years of continuous updates, I think that qualifies as “some time”
    oh ill sniff it alright
    its been 6 years. it could have changed easily 4 years ago
    I'd it doesn't represent the current state of the game it's really not an accurate picture of it. That happened like 6 years ago. It's not the game that we've had for some time.

This is like 1 starring a product because shipping damaged the box or Amazon sent you the wrong thing.
        That’s not an apt analogy. You’re saying that even if you received the wrong product from Amazon you’d 5 star what you originally ordered anyway?



>	it doesn’t represent the current state of the game 

Right. What’s the issue here? Steam offers “recent reviews” and a cumulative total. Both recent and cumulative offer an accurate picture. It was a trash game at launch but recently it’s really really great. They deserve the hit they took at launch snd deserve the credit for building the game up to what it is now.
    seriously impressive for someone to intentionally mislead themselves like this for over five years.
    The only reason you’re being downvoted is because consumers forget shit like this way too soon.

The fact that the devs cleaned up after the publishers mess is honorable, but we can’t have that as the norm.
        It usually isn't the norm.  Normally the devs of a dud game, make a few patches then just move on.
            Anthem anyone?
I wouldn't say "some years" tbh. The latest update with cities is the one that would most definitely bring it to "recommended" in my book. Before that the core gameplay loop still would feel a bit boring to many of players.  
Now we have a mini-city-sim inside the game, so we can keep more players in the game, that patch just broke the threshold of why players would stay/come back to play the game, hence why we're at positive reviews now.
They put out a new game already. Go play it now and see for yourself!
That continues to surprise me. There is no other game in my library that I keep getting blindsided by new updates with new content for absolutely free, years after it was released.
    KSP
        Terraria dropped a huge patch 10 years into its life cycle
            I still look for terraria updates every time I'm browsing my steam library. A man can hope, right? Ive put like 500 hours into that game. Every new big patch would give me the urge to start from scratch again
        Sadly finished now..
    Minecraft
    Warframe
    PoE, 7Days2Die and AoE II come to mind.
    It's because they're filthy rich due to a combination of initial hype buys + committing to fixing their launch failure, which inevitably led to continued player growth.

They have tens of millions for a small company of 20 people. They can just invest that green and then develop their brain child forever if they feel like it, without ever charging another dime.
[deleted]
    Oops lol. I meant play
Some of that, but mostly it’s the “I tried it for 30 minutes and all you do is shoot rocks. There is nothing to do in this game.” posts that I keep seeing.

Personally I can’t remember the last time I mined anything. It’s much easier to set up fleets/mines/farms/trading/scanning/quests/whatever and get just about anything you desire that way. Once you figure out what’s fun for you just invest in that and you’re set.

It’s like saying all you do in Minecraft is punch trees.
    The new player experience is kinda shitty
    >Personally I can’t remember the last time I mined anything. It’s much easier to set up fleets/mines/farms/trading/scanning/quests/whatever and get just about anything you desire that way. Once you figure out what’s fun for you just invest in that and you’re set.

That's all a little bit into the game though. So if all you played was the early portions where you are mining often and you come back and you still have to hand mine often, it looks like things haven't changed much.

The core gameplay loop is still pretty similar to launch, there's just *a lot* more to do outside of that pretty typical loop and that you can eventually break out of it.

NMS has come quite a long way indeed, but there are still legitimate gripes against the way it plays. Which, like, if it isn't for you, it isn't for you, but people gotta take it way too far as capital G Gamers.
        A lot of people’s gripes were reasons I liked the game. Since launch this game was my zen game, I would come home from high school stressed as balls and play some NMS to chill out. Nowadays, it’s no different with college.
        yup, I’m one of the people that just can’t get into it. it’s a good game and it’s improved astronomically since launch, but I still can’t find anything to hold my attention in it. made it about 60 hours before giving up trying to find stuff that interested me
    Never punched a tree in Minecraft, but that is literally how you start Ark.  Except when you start Ark by getting eaten by an Alpha raptor, and don't start punching trees until you respawn somewhere safer. 

And of course every game out there, whatever you do right at the start is what you do the entire rest of the game.  Just like PacMan - you eat one dot you've eaten them all.
        Fk ARK is such an addictive little cryfest of a game. So much better w mods and improved rates but even so. Awesome awesome game but damn is it a timesink, lol.
            Ark is a strange game. Its brutal and fun. It makes you angry, mad, even maybe keyboard ending but then you want more.

I dont have words for my feelings with Ark. Even Dark Souls isnt as brutal.
                Right?! Like 'omg I just lost all my stuff in this cave and I can't get back and damnit I really needed that gun from that drop, this game sucks I'm just gonna log off.

... okay but I should breed my wolves first and oh right I gotta put fertilizer in the crops and oh wow is that a max level yuty hold on'

Evil, evil, evil game.
    Go figure essentially a sandbox let's you do whatever you want and you may not get in the weeds right away huh lol
    I didn’t leave a negative review for the game, but I really couldn’t get into it. You have to concede that the first few hours of the game really drags a bit, and there isn’t a very clear goal for a new player. 10 hours in and I really didn’t know what I was supposed to be doing, so I stopped.  I like games with complexity but I really never found a gameplay loop, and I think it’s hard for new players or players who don’t have a lot of time to get into it. Maybe if there was some kind of jump start into the mid game maybe? Idk. I just wish the game was a bit more transparent about what I’m working towards.
        Just follow the quests you get, build bases, and explore every new thing you see. Your own goals should start forming before long.

It helps if you have a really, really open mind. Like a 'it's about the journey, not the destination' kind of approach. Way too often, I find myself getting completely derailed from what I was doing previously to pursue some other thing, and I'm totally okay with it.
            I gave it at least 10-15 hours in a single play through (I think I have maybe 30-40 hours total?) and I still wasn’t feeling any impetus to do much of anything. I was building a base but I didn’t know why. I had to go mine stuff and it felt tedious. I like hard games, I like challenging games. I just need some kind of gameplay loop to be evident within a reasonable about of time. NMS is opaque.
        Ah, you might want to try an expedition. They are limited time multiplayer events where you start with certain equipment on a specific planet and have to complete specific goals. A new one is starting soon so keep an eye out for it.
Uh, most of r/gaming just think it is boring but acknowledge it turned around from being trash at launch to pretty good.
    Ill always sit in Team "I bought at release and got burned".

But honestly, I saw the Frontier update and starting again. But id still prefer my refund, its still a game maybe worth about half what I paid for it, 5 years ago.

Id buy it today at the discount rate its at. However, I dont feel Hello Games ever made it right. Its hard, im trying to be sympathetic to the people playing it today but unless youve been so badly burned as I felt at release, I dont think youll ever get why I will keep my negative review forever.

If I ever see my refund ill change it to positive and rebuy it at the price its worth.

    For what it's worth, that robot never says anything you need to hear. Sometimes it'll give you warnings, but those always come accompanied with big visual warnings as well. You could mute the robot entirely and still play fine.
    If I'm remembering right, the only English-voiced NPC (aliens are voiced but in gibberish; the subtitles are translated as you learn more words) is the one that gives you messages like "temperature stabilizing", "shields down", and "extreme hazard planet". I think during that initial quest where you find your ship there's a bit of "system startup" type lines, but that's it.

In the top left corner is your health and shields for you/your ship, and you'll have a visual indicator of these going down if you get hit enough times.

Bottom left is your hazard protection and oxygen, these bars are always going down and always visible (unless you're in a building, where you're safe and they're stable), so the indicator is there.

For imminent threats like incoming storms, sentinels searching for you, hostile pirate ships in space, a text notice appears on screen, usually in the middle where it's very visible.

I do agree that subtitles/messages should be more complete AND consistent in terms of placement on screen, but almost everything that's voiced does have some form of either graphic or text indicator as well. It's definitely not perfect, but past that first quest, it's basically all generic notices
    I’m hard hearing/partial deaf in one ear with MASSIVE tinnitus…

It is a MUST to have captions. Any game that doesn’t include that is just plain lazy.
    push through, the voice messages aren't important at all. there are even mods that make the robot voice shut up.

the only important info is on the bottom right of the screen, from the exosuit guidance system.
        [deleted]
            there is dialog, it’s part of some of the main quests.. But I think those do have subtitles
    I listen to podcasts while playing. You're not missing *anything.*
    As others have pointed out, the robot voice isn't important and actually gets annoying once you're past the early game stage because it keeps pointing out the obvious.

Of course there was no way for you to know that so this is still an accessibility issue. I recommend reporting this as a missing feature on HG's website (https://hellogames.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013870118-I-have-an-issue-to-report-in-NMS). It was only a few months ago that they added a colour blind mode for the galaxy map, so they might still add more accessibility improvements if enough people ask for them.
    The voice over doesn’t matter at all. The only important information you need will be displayed as text on screen
    Just want to throw my hat in with everyone else: there's no 'spoken text' that you need to hear. 100% of important information is either solely text - like conversations and narrated events - or accompanied by text / obvious indicators, such as hazard / life support or combat alerts.

And actually, before long the robot voice becomes something of a negative...

Why?

Because when you're sprinting across the surface of an extreme weather planet back to your ship because you forgot to fuel the fucker before you ventured out so it can't automatically come to you, and left all of your hazard recharging material IN said ship, that god damn robot is repeating "BRO YOUR HAZARD SHIELD IS GOING DOWN" every 15 seconds while you're scrambling to find hazard recharging materials while getting back home, and I just wish I could physically punch the robot voice in its non-existent face.

And then you realize you can just dig into the ground to stop all of that garbage, and the robot voice is relegated back to a forgettable warning machine.
I just came from over there and saw that

    Name a major developer that hasn't done this.

I'll wait.
        nice whataboutism. Try and think about why this game was the worst reviewed game on steam for a long time and get back to me.

I’ll wait.
I don’t say fuck that game, but I got stuck with NMS after using my 2 hours on steam to try and get the game to work (didn’t support 1080 without crashing at launch). Steam denied my refund and was stuck with it at 30 minutes of actual play time but 2:10 of “steam playtime.”

I recognize the game is good now, but I’ll never forget or buy another Hello Games product. They built their game by tricking and lying to consumers for funding.
    The real lesson to learn from that is not to pre-order or buy games right after release. Always wait for proper reviews, and ideally bug fixes.
        Unfortunately no one learns this lesson. Just look at the clearly scam games at Kickstarter that promise impossible things by people with no experience in game development and manage to raise millions in funding.(like dreamworld and ages of elyria), or even at games like cyberpunk
            I mean No Mans Sky helped me dodge Fallout 76 a year later. I remember when the Bethesda devs released that letter like a week before release and it reeked of pure desperation, the "it wont be for everyone" and I went, gee... where have I seen that shit before and remembered Sean Murray's "Your Universe Awaits" letter.

Remember, No preorders.
        >	The real lesson to learn from that is not to pre-order or buy games right after release

The subtext to this “lesson” is that game developers are liars and shouldn’t be trusted. NMS is good but I can’t support the Hello Games worship propagated by people in this sub.
            > I can’t support the Hello Games worship propagated by people in this sub.

Go back five years and see this sub then. Many of the top posts of all time are still from that time. See how negative a lot of people were about the game when it was bad. And then, over time, the game got better and just like that, people started feeling better about it. The "worship propagated" here is exactly because the company came through, fixed the game and keeps developing it. And that's good.
                Yeah, but this guy wants to make shit up to justify to themselves why they are right and everyone else is wrong.
            Yeah, I see that statement time and time again, and then I see from the same people how much they can't wait for a new game to be ready for pre-order.
            > game developers are liars and shouldn’t be trusted

This is unfortunately the state of the industry these days. You can't trust developers or publishers.

Even if you think they have their heart in the right place, you never know what kinds of compatibility problems exist, game breaking bugs, or sequels that just have bad gameplay.

You can't trust reviewers who get early access to games because that industry has been compromised. If a game gets panned by a reviewer, they will never get another review copy of a game from that publisher again. It's a quid pro quo system and early review copies are reviewers lifeblood.
            It’s definitely a valid opinion, anybody with a critical outlook on the game gets downvoted even if it’s a valid opinion or statement. Reddit is a platform that was made to encourage open discussion, not censor people who hold differing opinion to others.
    relationships with you must be fantastic with this level of “i just absolutely cannot ever possibly let shit go. ever.”
    And that was commentary from "SniffMyRapeHole." Now, to sports
        I might have even found some iota of wisdom in what they were saying if it wasn't for that name.
    Sounds like a steam problem to some extent
        I mean, release a functional game with the features you promise and refund polices are moot, no?
            But if you don’t like the game you can just refund it.
                Please reread what I posted
        Lmao

        The right answer is honesty. He didn’t “hype the game a bit much” he straight up said features were in the game that weren’t. No space battles, no base building, no multiplayer, etc. he didn’t just say “this will be the greatest game you ever play!” He literally told me (us, the viewer) that the game was one thing and had features it most certainly did not have. And they were BIG features that made it a completely different game. 

If they had delayed or he had not said the things he did or explained the office situation I’d have more compassion, but it wasn’t just one instance. It was interview after interview where he just totally lied. I bought the lie.

Game is great now and what I thought I was buying 5 years ago. It’s just a shame that it took five years and destruction of consumer confidence to get there.
            If you don't want to move on, then hold yourself along with Hello Games accountable for your apparent misery. You irresponsibly bought into the hype and are a direct contributor to the gaming industry's shitty practices.

                He's just one of those deeply angry people. It's got nothing to do with HG or video games in general. As Chad Daniels says, he's one of those people that wakes up in the morning and says "How can I be a victim today?"
        A bit
Bruh every time NMS gets mentioned on reddit, IGN on facebook or youtube it's always flooded by people saying "biggest redemption arc ever xD", "thank goodness they didnt just flee with the money, thank you sean!!!" etc.
The intelligent alien species are predefined. Creatures you find on planets ofc are procedurally generated (which I just wanna point out Proc gen and predefined are basically the same thing but I get what you mean).
Man theres so much lore for you to uncover

    Click to select instead of hold is now an option. On PC, you can press keys on the number row to select dialogue choices. Console users can use the d-pad to quickly select choices.

Overall, the dialogue UI is generally more pleasant to use than it was several years ago.

Alien npcs are largely unchanged in appearance and animations. There are still the 3 original species - Gek, Korvax, and Vy'keen. A few more dialogues were added over time but it's still mostly the originals. There are also rarer Traveller npcs with strange and sometimes rewarding interactions; Their speech does not need translating.

I learned the languages semi-passively by using knowledge stones and monoliths while exploring and doing other things, rather than painstakingly walking up to every npc on stations. I did that a fair bit early on but it got old fast.

You can also build translator upgrades for your exosuit that guarantee a few words in each alien's sentence will be translated even if you don't know them, it's quite helpful, especially when few words are known.

Station interiors look mostly the same with only minor decorative variations. I suspect that may be subject to change in the future based on the focus of procedural structures/interiors added to derelict freighters in Desolation, and town settlements in Frontiers.

            Astroneer is a lot of fun :)

I can relate, it's always an experience coming back to a game and totally forgetting how to do everything lol. There's lots of helpful, friendly people here and on the NMS Discord if you have any questions about the game.

Good luck on your travels!

                    Options -> General Options -> Hold to confirm

You still have to hold to begin dialogue with npcs and interact with objects etc., but every in-menu hold is replaced with clicking
That hasn't changed.

        Technological limitation - your save game can only keep track of so many terrain modifications before it starts overwriting old ones.

In the original game concept that wasn't really a problem, as you were unlikely to ever go back to where you had been, but now with having umpteen bases everywhere, it is an obvious issue.
            [deleted]
                Minecraft and NMS's save structures are fundamentally different.

Minecraft's save files will inevitably bloat to many Gigabytes in size after enough time and exploration, as every single generated chunk and voxel's state is stored.

NMS generates and completely deletes voxel terrain data as the player moves around, regenerating it again as needed, with only player-made edits being stored in the save.

Unlike Minecraft, NMS is also made with cloud saving in mind. So the number of terrain modifications that can be stored is limited as the save file is ideally kept as small as possible. HG could go the Minecraft route, but at the cost of losing cloud save support and the inevitable massive save bloating.

All that aside, bases are glitched and don't retain terrain edits as they are intended to. Land fills back in long before the base's terrain edit limit is even reached and/or no other edits have been made.
                    [deleted]
                        Absolutely, and it is indeed supposed to work like that but doesn't :(

To my knowledge, HG has made several attempts to fix it with no success
                            [deleted]
                                I'm hoping they can fix it too. It would open up so many exciting possibilities for base building!

Good luck out there Traveller, I hope that you can one day (soon) return in full glory with an unburied base <3
                Minecraft uses servers to store your changes.  It also has a miniscule map in comparison to NMS. 

These make it _completely_ different from a technology perspective.

And yes, I get it that this destroys part of the gaming experience, it's been a constant source of complaints ever since base-building wherever you wanted has been a thing.  Originally you could only claim existing base-computers, and these where always placed on a flat piece of land.  Sounds similar to settlements, doesn't it? Cue people complaining they want to build their base anywhere. Hmm.. we've already got people asking to start their own settlements anywhere.
It's a distress call you get in space in a system while in your ship, that then starts its own separate quest tracking. Not sure if you need to have completed more main quest stuff, or if it can trigger the first time you leave a planet as soon as you get your ship repaired.
    I'm on creative, maybe its a random event, but i haven't started the main story.
Pretty much. The game was hyped to an impossible level and had they not been tied to sony and pretty much fixed release dates, they would have been able to delay it long enough to fix stuff or release it as a beta or something.
    I felt bad for Sean Murray, he got so much put on him for the release.
You can do all 3 I mean you can't share quests but if you do them together it works
Ditto, I still have my first save file. Can't remember what version of the game I last played it though... I wonder if I reinstall from disc whether it would load in the original game.  I've tended to start a new save whenever there was a major update.

I really wish they would have stayed with fantasy elements though; makes it much more believable than mixing real elements with fantasy.
    I think it just depends on how you play! It still seems pretty fantasy to me when I play. Well, as fantasy as a sci-fi game gets, but that's because my play style is pretty heavily exploration based. I like finding all the things. ...I have a pet six legged unicorn cat. I can ride it like a knight.

I have the PC version so I never got a disc, unfortunately. With Steam it'd just make us update it. Hopefully someone else can answer that other question. I kind of suspect they'd make it update. Perhaps there's a base version out there somewhere, though?
        If I reinstall on my PlayStation with network disabled, it will run the disc version..  although, we had a Day-1 patch at the time and there's no way to get that anymore.  And that's a good point - I don't think the disc version could load the savegame.
I played the game at launch for about 90 hours and stopped after the pathfinder update. I just started a new game. I agree that the emphasis was formerly on getting off the starting planet and getting the warp drive working. It is now on building the first base. However, there really isn't any reason you couldn't just find a new planet after building the first structure. The portals do take away the feeling of "no going back" the game had at first. I don't know if these are bad things, just different. I do not agree that the planets get the same after a few hours. I'm 6 hours into the new game and I've seen a volcano planet, and ocean planet that kind of blew my mind. The ringed planets are pretty awesome. The Anomaly is pretty amazing now. Overall I'm enjoying it. It's not a totally different game, but it is different enough. More about building rather than reaching the center of the Galaxy. I guess since I have the launch disc I could play the vanilla version if I really wanted to. (I think it would work, just can't upload discoveries.)
Hey you're entitled to your opinion. No worries. Feels like there is enough to do in the game that you never have to feel like you are stuck doing one thing. Just my opinion though.  I like to do different things and when I get bored I switch to something else. That's what I like about the game. I can build a base, reconfigure my freighter, run a settlement, hunt for new pets, or ships, and just do whatever I feel like at the time, no pressure.  If you prefer to always be exploring though I can understand the frustration seeing all these updates that seem to be focusing on everything else. Hopefully they'll add some more with the coming expedition.
The problem is that the game went mainstream and the massive groups of players clamoured for all of these features. The devs then caved in to the demands, diluting their original vision.

So instead of focusing more on the procgren aspects and trying to get it to generate different stuff in different galactic regions to enhance the exploration aspects, they instead focussed on things like player bases etc.

It's not a bad game now, but it's not what was originally promised. Many many people are very happy with what it has become, and I do enjoy it as well, but I am also sad that the original idea has been lost. And I don't see any way of HG recapturing that original idea without having to undo a lot of what's been added in the meantime.

I guess the general gamer is just not interested in the type of game that HG originally wanted to create and the game got too big to stay niche during the hype up prior to launch.
At launch you still had ships flying over head. I remember because I thought..."is that a real player??" Haha 

The whole "missing the isiolation" thing is weird to me. You can still feel very isolated. Go to a planet and walk around. You are alone. Go to the space station, you are mostly alone. Just avoid the nexus and settlements. 

The feeling of isolation is definitely still there if you want it to be, now there's just other things to do and they made the game feel more alive.
    I guess if you don't go to the Nexus, you do avoid all of the people. But the space stations do still have lots of aliens coming and going.
        Yeah but the space stations are pretty much the same as launch. At launch you had ships coming and going as well, and you still had venders and stuff. Now you just have a bit more.
Yes, the standard flight controls suck. I specifically bought an Elite Series 2 and configured the small left under-paddle to be the brake and the small right under-paddle to be acceleration. I also configured the left trigger to be change weapon and the right to be fire weapon. I called this setup Spaceship mode and also programmed a Spacesuit mode for when I leave my ship. In this setup the left small under-paddle is sprint and the right small under-paddle is jetpack. After playing this way for a year and a half my flying skills are truly a sight to behold. It was worth every penny of the $180 cost, but with the drawback of only being useful on XBOX or PC (bluetooth enabled).
HG set the timeline, Sony was blindsided as well.

It’s all been covered before, huge ambitions and Sean not being the best PR person set the stage for that drama.
    I see. Fair enough and still a good lesson about scope and PR
        Totally agree. NMS gave me a great lesson about pre-ordering games. 

I was so tempted to get cyber punk, but this taught me better.

I’ll probably download NMS again and give it another shot, if it’s so much better, I will be happy to change my review.
            It's so weird because I thought I would hate this game but a different game gave me a fresh perspective on this one.



After I played a game called Starbound I thought maybe it would be my kind of game. That and the famous internet historian video on the whole thing piqued my interest and here we are 100 hours later.
                After no man sky, and drama on the release, I got lost into a game called Dying Light,  l’ve got about 300 hours in that game and I don’t think no man sky is ever going to come close to that playtime lol
            I have been a real expensive headlight....

        I’d argue that his hard work with his team afterwards it’s worth some forgiveness. Mind you I got burned by the game as well at launch. 

5 years us enough, and it’s an old game by now.
            [deleted]
                Hey man, don’t get it misconstrued, if you go to my history you will see that I’m arguing with a NMS fanboy right now about his allegiance to a game that didn’t deliver.

I hate that this happened, I hate that an indie games was marketed as a AAA game, I hate the lies, I hate how bad their PR was when the game launched by them going radio silent for six months, and you better believe I was on all the forums talking about this game and this company.

But I already bought the game. And a PR team isn’t a development team, someone had to do the work to make a better game and in a lot of ways I’m glad that they did. 

In all honesty, I’ll download it again, play it for a few hours, get bored because it’s probably the same thing over and over again, and then uninstall it for a newer, more promising game. 

But I’m never gonna buy anything else from hello games, I just remark that work has been put into the game but I am no longer supporting this company. But work has been done.
        Hey, don't agitate Sean's cult. You must jerk him off daily and totally forgot about the time when he lied and scammed everyone.
No mans sky was 100% self funded and self published. Everything that went wrong was decided by sean and his wife as they own hg
From the description of the upcoming 3rd expedition I think your wishes might come true. As has been pointed out by multiple people : this is, surprisingly, only  version 3.6x and not the expected 4.0 ...
>reducing the whole thing to bland, automatic and endless grinding with no reprieve anywhere, 

What game you talking about, wow? That channel is -> way.
    I know it's been made less extreme over time. But NMS is still oriented around substantial grinding for resources, repeating very repetitive random encounters. And continously finding the upgrade slots so you can store these resources that you actually need to produce fuel. Just to take off without entering the atmosphere requires fuel, etc. (although cruising endlessly requires no fuel at all). The repetitive nature of the systems, the layouts of the systems, and the predictability of what you're going to find does not help in any way.

At one time, before Sony's beta-people got their hands on it, the game had a different approach: you did not need to grind. You would search out some planet, and the planet would very likely have an upgrade of some kind. If you needed a different resource, traveling the system might be a 20-30minute trek. And then you would get some sort of upgrade along the way, in way of ship or suit improvement, etc. But the game was oriented around getting to the next system, each system being a different challenge to get further.

That game is still under there, but your progress is measured in numbers and storage space, not in progress through the galaxy-map.

Some people prefer that. And they're very loud, and were certainly that during the initial launch of the game. But what is the case is that the game Hello Games made is still kind of an idea that isn't realized, thanks to a set of astonishingly bad tweaks that made a game about exploration into a game about bigger numbers. That part of the game is astonishingly boring - but the game is still played, because of the aesthetic, and the feeling of exploration. In spite of that all the mechanics-changes are trying to avoid that experience.

I'm just pointing out that now, by and large - which is a view that was violently opposed at launch - more people than average play this game for the exploration feel, rather than the .. well.. grinding resources to put into their home-base, so they can dispense with the whole exploration altogether, and just get bigger and bigger numbers.

And that's not strange - because there are a billion games out there that does this type of grinding much better and more addictive.

Not that Sony is ever going to see that - their people will suggest things like this: the grinding mechanics are made enjoyable and addictive, because of the aesthetic and the universe around it. It could all be replaced with a cutscene - all the tech involved is completely superfluous, all the work involved is utterly wasted. But that's how this game is, and really has been since right before launch.

Mission accomplished, if you're working at Sony, obviously.
10 years???
    Is it longer? I feel like its longer. Honestly i was one of the suckers who bought it on release and have downloaded and played it every time they update it.  So far, they have done a great job upgrading it, but its still a far cry from what they advertised it to be.
        Are you joking? It's been around five years.
            Feels like much much longer.  5yrs though? Really? I couldve sworn this game came out like 2012.
                You're definitely joking. The screenshot of Steam literally says it came out in 2016.
Ahhh... Cyperpunk 2077. 

And if you hate this game so much, why are you here?
    Cyberpunks launch was far better than No Mans Sky's lol, it's not even a comparison
        It wasn't. NMS actually went on to fix it for free, CP2077 didn't.
            NMS also ran when it launched. Yes it was buggy as hell. And no it didn't have anywhere what was promised. But CP2077 didn't run at all on most consoles. Barely ran on PC. And nothing that was promised what in the game. 

So yeah NMS and CP2077 had HORRIBLE launches filled with lies and bullshit. But Hello Games came through. I can't say as much for CDPR. Their last "update" was trash. 

As a final thought.. if you don't like the game why are you here?
            That's post launch, but NMS definitely has done a really good job post launch, much better than Cyberpunk so far.  


That's besides the point though
Why are you here?

        I'll use the same format as you, because apparently you read and understand it better :

It.Was.Hype.

a couple of month before the game released people were taking Sean Murray's (definitely stupid) words and interpreting in them things he never even said. Tons of idiots (can't use anything else, sorry) here thought that "every atom procedural" meant that all assets in NMS would be computer generated ... not that every visual would be composed of manually created assets. I mean .. how fucking dumb must you be?! 

I even wrote a comment saying that people would be thoroughly disappointed at release if they expected stuff that (still is) technologically impossible, and I got downvoted to minus heighty something.

so, again, Sean Murray didn't help, but 

IT.WAS.HYPE.

                Xanax would probably be better for you rather than some imaginary friend.

Multiplayer was "kind of" in game. https://massivelyop.com/2016/08/10/no-mans-sky-the-non-multiplayer-multiplayer-game/ (sadly the clip has been removed), but I'm sure you can "literally find videos" of what was happening. Finding this link took me exactly 23 seconds.

"The galaxies with real physics and orbit just like real life!" were deliberately scrapped for a much more SciFi'esk and *enjoyable* unrealistically close-knit approach. if you want to "fly" a make-belief spaceship for 45 minutes while watching netflix because that's all you can do during the flight, then by all means play E:D.

You might also want to check the meaning of psychopath, you little irrate narcist.

                        You're really an idiot, aren't you? Do they let you go out of your house alone or do you have to have a chaperone?

your clip is Sean Murray speaking out of his ass indeed, but most of what he says was actually in game (the whole chemical elements you can mix together to get something else) or has been allegedly scraped for *fun*'s sake (like the realistic astronomy).  Notice how he often uses "would" instead of "will" ... that's Sean Murray saying what might one day be possible, you pathetic excuse for a microscopically-brained-primate.

Learn to read and listen .. and maybe try to wrap your head around the fact that English is not everyone's first language ... Du blödes, stupides, unglaublich borniertes mutterfickendes Arschloch. Putain de merde! T'es con comme une porte de prison?!?

            who got scammed?
The radio silence after release was, in hindsight, exactly what they should have done (and did). Sean Murray is definitely not a PR-mastermind and anything they could have said would have been dissected and probably been vilified AND hyped (though not by the same people;).

They did what they do best : working on the update instead of talking about it.
Lol except for *all the people* asking for the updates. In case you haven’t noticed, HelloGames have built a huge, supportive fan base through their approach to NMS. Maybe you don’t like it, but that doesn’t mean everyone else feels the same. This kind of poo-poo’ing is basically the “stop having fun” meme.
[deleted]
Many people do ignore that the Anomaly and the Freighter systems are completely bugged, tbh
That uh wasn't a lie, the NMS periodical table was a very real thing
The game released 5 years ago, not 8
    3 years of development, 5 years of testing.
They mostly come out at night... mostly
What you get for playing on console.
    Rich comment, considering that usually it's the PC versions that are plagued by this sort of issues.  

Played on PC for a while but this is one of those games where I like to sit back on the sofa and relax whilst playing.
This is really important to remember.

The UK has a really transparent attitude to business. You can go right now and check Hello Games figures.

They have an operating profit margin of >70%

In 2019 their total sales for was 18m with a profit margin of 76%, or 13.59m GBP in PROFIT. For a company of 20 people, that's absurd.

In 2019 they literally have 70m GBP in the bank. 70m!! Company of 20 people. That's insane.

[https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06663645/filing-history](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06663645/filing-history)
    Wow. That's a lot of money.

Let's hope that translates to NMS updates years into the future!
        It absolutely does. You often see people here saying "they can charge for the next DLC and I'll pay!", but the reality is they can make the game for 10 years from now without making a single penny in revenue, and still have money in the bank at the end.
            Pretty cool job for life!  I'm glad they're sticking at it.
            Nah fam, they're literally never gonna have to worry about money ever again. All they have to do is invest even a decent chunk of that money properly, and then they can do whatever they want from there, for the rest of their lives.

If I had 70 mil / 20 people, I'd make updates for NMS forever, or as long as was practical, and do it at a leisurely pace without ruining my health or general well being as the game development sector often does. (Due to virtually non-existent employee protections.)

And yeah, that'd be a dream come true. Just being able to play your passion for the rest of your life without destroying your interest due to 'necessity'. Plus the game continues to put out because more updates = more new players.

Can you imagine? It's crazy how they completely leaned into their rather abysmal failure and turned it into a resounding success. The hilarious part is that what they promised and failed to deliver at the beginning, is now completely possible because they have all the time in the world to just work on this game in any way they please.
                if they invest in a good wallet of companies, real state, etc. 10mil they get easily enough to pay everyone there every month a good amount of money. they could use part of that money to help other small game companies make their games a reality. if the game is really good they could just add those people to their company and let them make the game as a Hello Games IP.
            The funny this is I never seen this for other companies except for fromsoft where people will buy the dlcs as soon they come out. I would gladly buy their dlcs just to support them. But since we get it for free I wish they implement some way to support them more.
    Okay holy shit. Now I see why they don't have paid DLCs or anything like that. Like, they literally don't need that much money. I also heard that Sean pays himself surprisingly little considering that he's the boss. 

Also, I knew Hello Games was small but - 20 people?? Ubisoft has 19,000 lmao
        Props to Sean
            Absolutely. He has put together one hell of a team!
    that is why the updates are free. that makes you think why The Sims is like it is... you need to pay like 800USd to play the game with all the things it has now
    One of the reasons they have so much money now is because they had losses earlier got a bunch of tax refunded
        That's not how that works lol

If you make losses and get tax refunded, you don't end up with 70m pound in the bank. Read the documents, it covers their revenue. They're making 15m a year with outgoing of less than 3. That's why they have 70m cash on hand.
            I did read their statements, did you? Its in note 8.

They made $4 million and $5 million in the past 2 years respectively due to government tax credits/grants
    No, that's faith in your vision. On the opposite side of the coin you get Star Citizen - which is faith in other's gullibility.

Sean and Hello Games... congratulations on NMS 5th birthday, pulling out of the dread Steam spiral o'doom, and my personal thanks for 3+ years of in-game enjoyment- long may it continue!
This. Even if I don't see myself playing their next project (for whatever reason), I will still purchase it out of pure support.
still a little terrifying though that an indie studio can literally sell such a piece of shit to begin with, with full backing from bigger studio, including late night tv spots and massive amounts of fan love for what it was said to be... only for it to be what was initially released? 

i'm really happy they changed it, it would have been fine the way it was if it wasn't falsely advertised. but that false advertisement made them millionaires, them making it whole shouldn't undo the mistakes, most devs wouldn't have even had the chance to become millionaires with the game they released to begin with.

so they basically ended up where they said they would be and it took them 5 extra years with millions in advance, which would be the dream for any new dev.

a smaller man would have ran away with it (and seemingly did...). but good on them for continuing until it was up to the standard they said it would  be.
    Its been the game it was supposed to be since 2018, everything included since then has been extra and free for the last 3 years now. 

I also believe in redemption, clearly you don't I guess. 

>them making it whole shouldn't undo the mistakes

It's not undoing any mistake. Their reputation went to absolute shit for 5 years. It's only just now getting better, after years of basically working for free. Almost like a prison sentence, or at least being put on community service. They "did their time". What more do you exactly want?

5 years ago did you want their studio cancelled and closed as if that would have made the better outcome? Cancel culture... I swear...
        > Cancel culture... I swear...

Reddit: "Fucking cancel culture is ruining everything!"

Cashier: "Sir, this is a McDonalds..."
        >	I also believe in redemption, clearly you don't I guess

People are allowed to be mad, they put out a game then went radio silent for a couple of months after they got called out on its status. 

Honestly though, this sub at that time of turmoil was way better than the game! The drama was too damn good!
            I don’t get people being mad at all, honestly. Disappointed? Sure, but not mad. Correct me if I’m wrong but most people who didn’t like the game upon release could get refunded their money, so what did they lose? Faith in a good game being made? Sure, but that seems like a very immature thing to be mad over. And even more, and immature thing to hold against them. 
Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Eh, anyone can feel however they want, but the game has been spectacular for a few years now, and has just been getting better, in my opinion. I also feel like anyone who’s still upset about it’s release needs to grow up. But that just my personal feelings about it all.
                > Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Not in this age. A tweet doesn’t cost 12 hours and a lot of man hours to put out.  Especially when they were developing the game and they were tweeting all over the place up until the launch. How does that make sense?

Immature to hold against them? They are a company that delivered a product that was poor. If you’re new to gaming, you must be new to the complaints  gamers have about all sorts of products. It is not immature to want the features they promised.

It would be immature and naïve to assume game developers shouldn’t communicate with their consumers. Who doesn’t do that? 

As much as I hate Todd Howard, he delivered a better game with Skyrim. And when it came out buggy, they communicated and fixed it which is why that game is legendary and no man sky will be only legendary for fixing a mistake.

Hell even this announcement is odd isn’t it? Like they are on the special because they are fixing a problem, no other reason. That’s a low bar.

Also as a gaming consumer, you don’t want to get developers in this habit of delivering piss poor products with the promise of fixing it much later.
                    This was a game that got too hyped up because of communicating too much. A game that had high hopes that couldn’t be met with their resources and time. I think radio silence was the smartest move for them. 

Yes, it’s immature to hold a grudge on a small dev group that is clearly trying to make a game they love. I understand that they didn’t give what was promised but honestly? It doesn’t fucking matter. They’re trying their hardest to improve the game and it’s better now than it ever could have been at launch, and it has nothing to do with promises or talking to their fan base, but simply caring about their product. 

No Man’s Sky may be legendary to you only for fixing a mistake, but that’s not the case for everyone. They made a mediocre glitchy game to start and then built upon it. I’m sorry that you can’t move past what it was, but some of us can. 

I’ll die on the hill that living with grudges and always holding mistakes above peoples heads forever is immature, and shows a lack of growth in character. 

You can feel however you want about this game but anger is an immature emotion to feel about something so inconsequential as a video game. I’ve never felt angry when a game fails to live up to its expectations and promises because I know how hard being an artist is. No matter how grand the idea, it’s only as good as how you execute it. 

They had a bad launch but I believe wholeheartedly that every step that they’ve taken since then has been the right one. They’ve redeemed themselves, and they kept going. 

Also, I don’t think that I fully agree with your final statement. I think that a game as vast and exploration based as NMS benefits from being released as a base and then being built upon. I think if they had thought of doing it that way initially, they could’ve made the base game better, admittedly, but used that foundation to do what they’ve done, which I think is ultimately successful and a relatively reasonable model. I think it’s a very stagnant mindset to expect everything to work the same way all the time, and anything that diverts from the standard flow is unacceptable. 

They’ve done well, regardless of what you think, and deserve every bit of praise that they get. But we’re allowed to disagree, otherwise, this world would be a rather stagnant place, no?
            Sure they are, no-one said they aren't allowed to be mad. But after they've more than made up for it by now, it make them look childish and immature to not be capable for moving on.
                I mean that’s what people did, they moved on. The game came out in 2016, and lots video games have been coming out that have been phenomenal since then, with better releases and without drama.

I would argue it kind of hurts the industry to not give those developers props for better releases.
                    ??? one company being commended for providing free updates and fixing and expanding their game beyond the original vision doesn't mean other developers aren't getting props for their release. That doesn't make any sense. I'm getting the feeling you haven't even played the game since release to be honest.
                        Beyond their original vision? No man, this is their vision realized.

And  I think you’re confusing “free” updates with “required” updates. as in hello games required these updates if they ever wanted to function as a game company ever again. 

Their reputations were on the line,  and no one is bound to play a bad game in hopes of it getting better. 

Hello game situation is unique, but in most cases developers would walk away. Someone who had a bad launch knows that players are going to leave to play other games.

Have you been stuck on this game since 2016? Think about how many awesome games you may have missed. Games that were already done at launch. 

Doesn’t seem silly to risk that for another bad launch? what if another video game has a horrible launch, do you have to play it through and wait until they improve it? I’d argue hell no you don’t.

Don’t be a fan boy, be a good consumer.
                            Remember that itemized list of everything promised that was missing from launch? Yea back when the NEXT update came out, they pulled that list out and 95% of it was done...

Infact majority of the games features it has now wasn't even something they promised (some were even things they said would never be in). So yea... that does count as beyond their original vision.

Obviously i haven't only played this game since 2016, this isn't about saying launch nms was fine, it was broken af. This is about saying "awesome! They gave us what was promised and then some. What a great turn of events".

Like seriously, how hard of a concept is it for you to understand that?

What i can't understand is why someone who holds such a grudge against this game keeps coming back to the reddit. Like, you talk about missing out on other games but here you are wasting your time airing your grievance about how the game was 5 years ago 5 years later.

If that isn't the definition of pathetic, idk what is. Just "move on" already ffs
Recent reviews have actually gone down a few % since frontiers, at least that what I saw when I checked if it's mostly positive yet. Not sure why that is tho. Currently recent reviews are on 92%, there are plenty of games higher than that.
    New major update means a lot of bugs. These bugs get fixed really fast but most of the people try out the game right after the update and see these bugs and quit immediately leaving a review "buggy game bad" and don't touch it again.
        I think its more about the mobile game gameplay with 4 hours of waiting time for each part on buildings.
            4 hours, not 2 weeks (very common for mobile games to have wait beyond that), also you cant skip the wait with Micro Transactions. I just think its so people don't grind all the content in one long marathon (which would be very not fun, this kind of content is meant to be segmented over time to be fun)
                I think the problem is that the system works well as a sort of side feature during normal gameplay, but a lot of players are at "end game." Having a timer to check up on your settlement is fine when you have the main quest and other side quests and other timers from the base building questline and are upgrading your equipment...

When you're at the point where your main objective is just going where the solar wind takes you, and the solar wind takes you to this new settlement feature and it can't just be the thing you're doing, that's when it becomes frustrating. Which is why we should be able to pump some kind of resource or units or nanites or something to speed up the process.
                    They should have just made it so that it takes a lot more resources to upgrade each building. That way new players will have another thing to work towards and end game players will have something to dump their resources into. The whole waiting time thing is just AIDS.
                    The problem is that parts of buildings are split up so you have to go back multiple times. It should be one interaction and then you go away for however many hours, come back and it's finished.
                        Or have each part be immediately interactable with their own timers. So if you have the supplies for the frame but not the roof, you can start construction on that part while you get the other materials. If you have everything you need, you can start construction on all parts and have them all be done in an hour or whatever.
                A few complaints I have heard are mainly regarding the time gating from streamer friends, they want to stream the new content and stuff, but end up just doing older content because of the gating. Makes it a very hard update to stream and showcase content, and these guys are space billionaires so it's not like they missed any content previously.
                    I dont really want game mechanics dictated by whats easier for streamers. I want the developers to think about what's best for the gameplay and the mechanics. I'm not saying whether or not they should change the time gating or not but it absolutely shouldn't be so streamers have more content and can make more money, it should be whatever makes the game more fun for the average player.
                        I get what you are saying, but as a non-streamer I absolutely hate time gates
                            I'm not disagreeing with that at all. I just think making design choices based on streamers preferences is not a good way to go about deciding how the mechanics of games work.

Edit: wording
                        Whether anyone likes it or not, streamers are an important aspect that has to be considered from a development and community standpoint. More and more, streamers are becoming a determining factor in a long-term health and viability.
                4 hours two weeks it does not matter tbh. The problem is that you had to wait to throw almost nothing in there then you have to wait again. During the 12 hour total session it takes i could have built 100 similar landing pad. In a game if its not mobile game idling timers are just stupid and unnecessary. The game supposed to engage the player and not to make them go away and then come back for 3 minutes to perform a click just to wait another 4 hours.
Make the settlement building engaging. Force the player (By making actuall high rsc needs for buildings) to either actually grind the resources for the building or buy it. Atleast we would have some use for units after buying our dream ships and freighter.
                Better then having to wait a year to have your city completed. You should be able to speed it up atleast with batteries or some shit.
                    Seriously. It's painful seeing my settlement just get farther and farther into debt faster than things can build.
                        I'm not having the same experience. I'm on my 7th building and my debt is only about 175k. I did choose mostly production boosting buildings first off. So the income is healthy.

Also I went to multiple settlements and looked at stats before claiming one. My first was just a test run just to figure out mechanics. Found and claimed a new one shortly after.
                            I also looked at about a dozen or so and couldn't find one better than C class.
        Yeah, Steam reviews just aren't very reliable. In my experience the bugs mostly have to do with textures loading in, definitely nothing that constitutes a negative review. (especially in a world where games like Cyberpunk and ARK exist)

Granted I waited until friday to play the update, but that's when it went on sale anyways (I've had the game since Origins), and thus when all the new people flooded in.
        Or perhaps we don't like the game as it is today? P
    Because the new update turned the game into a buggy mess, combined with the fact that the new update gave the game a lot of exposure on steam so that many new players had their first day in game being just after it was broken by frontiers...

It's not hard to see how that would farm you some negative reviews.

They *really* need to be fixing the rest of what was broken sooner rather than later. Combining the game's high exposure days with it's high bug count days isn't good.
I never tried writing Steam reviews so I'm not sure if that's allowed, but my guess is people changed their old negative reviews to positive.
    I’m one of those. Once Frontiers made the universe feel alive I really felt like we’d come full circle and changed my review. 

Also I’d kind of forgotten I’d rated it negatively back when it launched. I’m glad I reinstalled!!
    That's absolutely allowed. Steam won't let you add a second review but will let you edit an old one or delete it. I recently changed my review of another game from recommended to not recommended due to what the asinine developers are doing to that game.
        Should I ask what game that is?
            I immediately thought "world of warcraft" lol... i know it's not but it fits the description lol
                I got into wow again a month before the whole shitshow happened and was keen to play it, then just stopped subbing. Hope blizzard sorts their shit out
                    Yeah I did too. I rerolled, leveled my Alliance (the ratio is another mess) char up. Just got into the Maw for the first time and started to noticed less and less of the guild was online. I asked,, and unsubbed.
        What game is that, so I can avoid it too!
    There was quite a big campaign on the subreddit here reminding people to change their reviews.
    Just seems odd that it happened all at the same time and it didn’t happen before.
        Maybe a big update came out? Origins came out in September 2020, and I remember everyone saying "now we've finally got the game they'd promised" and "NMS is finally good".
            Don't forget covid struck. A lot of people may have started playing again after not for a long time do to quarantine and found the improvements.
                Oh yeah, I forgot about Covid

...is a phrase that most people probably won't say for a while...

but I actually did.
                    Amnesia one of the side-effects. :-D
                        Nah man, that a different game series. /s
                    I keep forgetting that its been a fucking year since it started. It feels like that shit started like 4 or 5 months ago
                        I feel you man it's been a long 2020
                        We're approaching two years.

And I would hold onto my pants, because due to various circumstances I won't bother getting into, doesn't seem like it will be going away for a while.

Nerds truly did inherit the Earth when the COVID-19 update was released for Life.
        I can be wrong, but it seems to be aligned with the Origins release (Sept 2020). Which would make sense, as this was (in my book) by far the best update.
            The down tick started in the beginning of 2020, Origins released September 2020.
    You can redo your review at any time as long as you have the game.
    You can indeed change your review later.
Likely to be people switching their original negative review to a positive one :)
    That’s normal but to that extreme fluctuation isn’t do they get those statistics solely from Steam reviews?
        Like people said above it's probably just because of an update which reminded them to change their review. As for Steam250 I believe they pull all their live data directly from Steam reviews
        "Extreme fluctuation?" It's 1,000 reviews of nearly 50,000 negative reviews. That's barely 2%.
I'm one who was disappointed until the [engoodening of no man's sky](https://youtu.be/O5BJVO3PDeQ). Honestly it's now not even what I want to play, not the game I wanted, but before it was pretty much empty and repetitive. It's still probably that way too some degree but without any additional money it's become a real fully featured game with great developers who care about the product and people. That's worth my respect at least.
    They definitely made it into a 60$ game, when it came it it definitely wasn’t which is pretty much proven by the fact the active players a day went from a quarter of a million to the hundreds in less than two months on Steam.
Change your review.
Maybe covid. Lots of free time not leaving the house equals more people playing games they wouldn't?

I know that I finally played an MMO during my lockdown and also finally figured out how monster hunter works, never would have done either if I was able to leave the house
Always goes on sale at update time. Often does it during steam sales too.
    I know that, I just mean it goes on sale way more often than the game updates. Did you even look at it? It went on sale 7 times this year alone. There has not been 7 updates this year.
Offer it to a friend !
    Would we be able to play together if we were on separate sources?
        You can, but voice communication would be difficult. I’ve had to play with my step son on his Xbox and me on pc while he uses discord on his tablet
            Couldn’t you just use the Xbox app on your Pc? 

I do that to play Forza with a friend who is on Xbox
                Oh... I never thought of that. I have everything Xbox disabled because it was Messing with rocket league a while back and I had forgotten that I had it. Great idea
                    It’s not the best platform on PC but it’s much simpler for the other party, and sound quality should be better than on a tablet.
                        I imagine that a headset can be pluged as on a phone, or with a usb OTG.
            That's what Discord is for! 😁
        About all I read you can play cross platform, there is no cross save game (xbox to PS to PC)

[Edited] thx for the GOG multiplayer info.

            Yeah GOG is weird with high-end games like this. So is Epic Games. Though EG is somewhat less so.
                [Outdated]
Thanks for your input, u/SniffMyRapeHole
    Lol wtf
    That guy's comment was decidedly not r/rimjob_steve material
You can blame the publisher for pushing the developers to release an unfinished game. 

The devs have been doing a lot to make the game what they promised and I feel they deserve the comeback. It’s a fun game that exceeded my expectations when I picked it up last year.
    And Sony for promoting what was essentially an indie game as a big triple A release. No way it could've lived up to expectations at launch
I get where you're coming from. HG messed up and were complete noobs when it came to PR, but that doesn't mean they don't deserve to redeem themselves. For some reason there's people who's values will not allow them to forgive them no matter the fixes and content inclusions *just* because of what happened half a decade ago.

But what's equally as weird as people legitimately upset that it's not rated "overwhelmingly positive" due to how much they like this game when there's clearly issues with it. Apart from basic bugs and polish, the major complaint from people who don't like the game has been that the gameplay loop doesn't push you to do anything.
    That the gameplay loop isn't a thing and isn't pushing me to do anything is precisely why I love the game. There are a million games I can play to linearly progress through a bunch of pre-determined series of events, and that's been more or less the definition of a video game for decades. It's nice to have an endless expanse and lots of options for things to do where I can just relax and go about whatever I please at whatever pace suits my energy/attention levels in that moment.
        Booooooo. Honestly I've rated the game down for its lack of depth and boring gameplay loop. People like you who defend that and say "actually less is more" are terrifying to me as you allow companies to get away with the absolute bare minimum. Let me elaborate.. 

A sandbox game is great if only two things are accomplished 

1. The player is given fun toys. NMS has done this.

2. The game has given players ways to utilize these toys. NMS has not done this.

This results in an aimless gameplay loop where the player can get "stuff" but there is nothing to do with said "stuff". For example.. You can get a mech. Awesome. What can you do with mech? What practical application is there? Does it allow you to do something you could not do before, like go to a special planet or get a special item? We know the answer obviously, but this is the depth issue that NMS suffers from.

Not to mention to be a game *centered* around exoration, the exploration *sucks* in this game. Once you've seen 5 planets you've effectively seen them all. There is no real sense of exploration, no matter where you go. Just big rolling hills, deep chasms the look ugly as sin 99% of time and a static sea level. No changes in biome, unique geographical features, just the same boring terrain over and over again. The most exciting terrain you'll find is maybe some under sea caves, but that's about it. Now go play valheim and be amazed by what proc gen can accomplish. Rolling meadows, dense mysterious forest and rivers, towering mountain peaks, and vast swamps. 

Hello Games have actually done very little to improve NMS. Most of these updates are useless fluff that adds buggy, half thought out features to the game that nobody cares about or asked for. Then like clock work the sycophants howl on Twitter praising hello games for never giving up, despite the game being announced live service on launch, and pretending like riding on animals or exploring boring derelict freighters are what was missing from this turd turning into a polished gem stone. Multiplayer is still buggy and useless, missions are ab-so-lutely crap, the "story" is a jumbled mess of incomprehensible pseudo-intellectualism that is presented in the most un inspired lazily way (another hot take, its similar to foullout 76's format of telling the story through "chasing ghost" except even that game had some sense to add good environmental story telling to keep it from being boring).

I know I'm going to get downvoted to hell, but honestly your comment just really bothers me. You all are so willing to except such a sub par product and put it on such a high pedestal.. its like looking at a cult.
            > You all are so willing to except such a sub par product and put it on such a high pedestal.. its like looking at a cult.

This is exactly how I feel every time I read any of the Nintendo or Nintendo game subs. 

Really don't understand how some game developers get absolutely crucified for making even the tiniest mistake but others can get away with doing the bare minimum or less and be praised for it. 

I wouldn't say your critique of NMS is entirely fair but overall I agree with the sentiment.
                I totally agree! Nintendo bugs the hell out of me too! They absolutely get by doing the bare minimum.
            Hey, calm down maybe? The fact that it terrifies you and enrages you that different people like different things than you do is borderline sociopathy. You've got a lot of growing to do to be able to accept that not everyone is going to fit your cookie cutter shape, and that's OK, because there are other shapes and they are great too in their own way.
                Hearing critiscm about a game prompts you to call the critic a sociopath? That's very healthy behavior. I never once insulted you, I just gave a very well thought out opinion. Maybe you should relaxe and re evaluate some things.
I think they’ve more than made up for it
It’s been 5 years of continuous updates, I think that qualifies as “some time”
oh ill sniff it alright
its been 6 years. it could have changed easily 4 years ago
I'd it doesn't represent the current state of the game it's really not an accurate picture of it. That happened like 6 years ago. It's not the game that we've had for some time.

This is like 1 starring a product because shipping damaged the box or Amazon sent you the wrong thing.
    That’s not an apt analogy. You’re saying that even if you received the wrong product from Amazon you’d 5 star what you originally ordered anyway?



>	it doesn’t represent the current state of the game 

Right. What’s the issue here? Steam offers “recent reviews” and a cumulative total. Both recent and cumulative offer an accurate picture. It was a trash game at launch but recently it’s really really great. They deserve the hit they took at launch snd deserve the credit for building the game up to what it is now.
seriously impressive for someone to intentionally mislead themselves like this for over five years.
The only reason you’re being downvoted is because consumers forget shit like this way too soon.

The fact that the devs cleaned up after the publishers mess is honorable, but we can’t have that as the norm.
    It usually isn't the norm.  Normally the devs of a dud game, make a few patches then just move on.
        Anthem anyone?
KSP
    Terraria dropped a huge patch 10 years into its life cycle
        I still look for terraria updates every time I'm browsing my steam library. A man can hope, right? Ive put like 500 hours into that game. Every new big patch would give me the urge to start from scratch again
    Sadly finished now..
Minecraft
Warframe
PoE, 7Days2Die and AoE II come to mind.
It's because they're filthy rich due to a combination of initial hype buys + committing to fixing their launch failure, which inevitably led to continued player growth.

They have tens of millions for a small company of 20 people. They can just invest that green and then develop their brain child forever if they feel like it, without ever charging another dime.
Oops lol. I meant play
The new player experience is kinda shitty
>Personally I can’t remember the last time I mined anything. It’s much easier to set up fleets/mines/farms/trading/scanning/quests/whatever and get just about anything you desire that way. Once you figure out what’s fun for you just invest in that and you’re set.

That's all a little bit into the game though. So if all you played was the early portions where you are mining often and you come back and you still have to hand mine often, it looks like things haven't changed much.

The core gameplay loop is still pretty similar to launch, there's just *a lot* more to do outside of that pretty typical loop and that you can eventually break out of it.

NMS has come quite a long way indeed, but there are still legitimate gripes against the way it plays. Which, like, if it isn't for you, it isn't for you, but people gotta take it way too far as capital G Gamers.
    A lot of people’s gripes were reasons I liked the game. Since launch this game was my zen game, I would come home from high school stressed as balls and play some NMS to chill out. Nowadays, it’s no different with college.
    yup, I’m one of the people that just can’t get into it. it’s a good game and it’s improved astronomically since launch, but I still can’t find anything to hold my attention in it. made it about 60 hours before giving up trying to find stuff that interested me
Never punched a tree in Minecraft, but that is literally how you start Ark.  Except when you start Ark by getting eaten by an Alpha raptor, and don't start punching trees until you respawn somewhere safer. 

And of course every game out there, whatever you do right at the start is what you do the entire rest of the game.  Just like PacMan - you eat one dot you've eaten them all.
    Fk ARK is such an addictive little cryfest of a game. So much better w mods and improved rates but even so. Awesome awesome game but damn is it a timesink, lol.
        Ark is a strange game. Its brutal and fun. It makes you angry, mad, even maybe keyboard ending but then you want more.

I dont have words for my feelings with Ark. Even Dark Souls isnt as brutal.
            Right?! Like 'omg I just lost all my stuff in this cave and I can't get back and damnit I really needed that gun from that drop, this game sucks I'm just gonna log off.

... okay but I should breed my wolves first and oh right I gotta put fertilizer in the crops and oh wow is that a max level yuty hold on'

Evil, evil, evil game.
Go figure essentially a sandbox let's you do whatever you want and you may not get in the weeds right away huh lol
I didn’t leave a negative review for the game, but I really couldn’t get into it. You have to concede that the first few hours of the game really drags a bit, and there isn’t a very clear goal for a new player. 10 hours in and I really didn’t know what I was supposed to be doing, so I stopped.  I like games with complexity but I really never found a gameplay loop, and I think it’s hard for new players or players who don’t have a lot of time to get into it. Maybe if there was some kind of jump start into the mid game maybe? Idk. I just wish the game was a bit more transparent about what I’m working towards.
    Just follow the quests you get, build bases, and explore every new thing you see. Your own goals should start forming before long.

It helps if you have a really, really open mind. Like a 'it's about the journey, not the destination' kind of approach. Way too often, I find myself getting completely derailed from what I was doing previously to pursue some other thing, and I'm totally okay with it.
        I gave it at least 10-15 hours in a single play through (I think I have maybe 30-40 hours total?) and I still wasn’t feeling any impetus to do much of anything. I was building a base but I didn’t know why. I had to go mine stuff and it felt tedious. I like hard games, I like challenging games. I just need some kind of gameplay loop to be evident within a reasonable about of time. NMS is opaque.
    Ah, you might want to try an expedition. They are limited time multiplayer events where you start with certain equipment on a specific planet and have to complete specific goals. A new one is starting soon so keep an eye out for it.
Ill always sit in Team "I bought at release and got burned".

But honestly, I saw the Frontier update and starting again. But id still prefer my refund, its still a game maybe worth about half what I paid for it, 5 years ago.

Id buy it today at the discount rate its at. However, I dont feel Hello Games ever made it right. Its hard, im trying to be sympathetic to the people playing it today but unless youve been so badly burned as I felt at release, I dont think youll ever get why I will keep my negative review forever.

If I ever see my refund ill change it to positive and rebuy it at the price its worth.
For what it's worth, that robot never says anything you need to hear. Sometimes it'll give you warnings, but those always come accompanied with big visual warnings as well. You could mute the robot entirely and still play fine.
If I'm remembering right, the only English-voiced NPC (aliens are voiced but in gibberish; the subtitles are translated as you learn more words) is the one that gives you messages like "temperature stabilizing", "shields down", and "extreme hazard planet". I think during that initial quest where you find your ship there's a bit of "system startup" type lines, but that's it.

In the top left corner is your health and shields for you/your ship, and you'll have a visual indicator of these going down if you get hit enough times.

Bottom left is your hazard protection and oxygen, these bars are always going down and always visible (unless you're in a building, where you're safe and they're stable), so the indicator is there.

For imminent threats like incoming storms, sentinels searching for you, hostile pirate ships in space, a text notice appears on screen, usually in the middle where it's very visible.

I do agree that subtitles/messages should be more complete AND consistent in terms of placement on screen, but almost everything that's voiced does have some form of either graphic or text indicator as well. It's definitely not perfect, but past that first quest, it's basically all generic notices
I’m hard hearing/partial deaf in one ear with MASSIVE tinnitus…

It is a MUST to have captions. Any game that doesn’t include that is just plain lazy.
push through, the voice messages aren't important at all. there are even mods that make the robot voice shut up.

the only important info is on the bottom right of the screen, from the exosuit guidance system.
    [deleted]
        there is dialog, it’s part of some of the main quests.. But I think those do have subtitles
I listen to podcasts while playing. You're not missing *anything.*
As others have pointed out, the robot voice isn't important and actually gets annoying once you're past the early game stage because it keeps pointing out the obvious.

Of course there was no way for you to know that so this is still an accessibility issue. I recommend reporting this as a missing feature on HG's website (https://hellogames.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013870118-I-have-an-issue-to-report-in-NMS). It was only a few months ago that they added a colour blind mode for the galaxy map, so they might still add more accessibility improvements if enough people ask for them.
The voice over doesn’t matter at all. The only important information you need will be displayed as text on screen
Just want to throw my hat in with everyone else: there's no 'spoken text' that you need to hear. 100% of important information is either solely text - like conversations and narrated events - or accompanied by text / obvious indicators, such as hazard / life support or combat alerts.

And actually, before long the robot voice becomes something of a negative...

Why?

Because when you're sprinting across the surface of an extreme weather planet back to your ship because you forgot to fuel the fucker before you ventured out so it can't automatically come to you, and left all of your hazard recharging material IN said ship, that god damn robot is repeating "BRO YOUR HAZARD SHIELD IS GOING DOWN" every 15 seconds while you're scrambling to find hazard recharging materials while getting back home, and I just wish I could physically punch the robot voice in its non-existent face.

And then you realize you can just dig into the ground to stop all of that garbage, and the robot voice is relegated back to a forgettable warning machine.
Name a major developer that hasn't done this.

I'll wait.
    nice whataboutism. Try and think about why this game was the worst reviewed game on steam for a long time and get back to me.

I’ll wait.
The real lesson to learn from that is not to pre-order or buy games right after release. Always wait for proper reviews, and ideally bug fixes.
    Unfortunately no one learns this lesson. Just look at the clearly scam games at Kickstarter that promise impossible things by people with no experience in game development and manage to raise millions in funding.(like dreamworld and ages of elyria), or even at games like cyberpunk
        I mean No Mans Sky helped me dodge Fallout 76 a year later. I remember when the Bethesda devs released that letter like a week before release and it reeked of pure desperation, the "it wont be for everyone" and I went, gee... where have I seen that shit before and remembered Sean Murray's "Your Universe Awaits" letter.

Remember, No preorders.
    >	The real lesson to learn from that is not to pre-order or buy games right after release

The subtext to this “lesson” is that game developers are liars and shouldn’t be trusted. NMS is good but I can’t support the Hello Games worship propagated by people in this sub.
        > I can’t support the Hello Games worship propagated by people in this sub.

Go back five years and see this sub then. Many of the top posts of all time are still from that time. See how negative a lot of people were about the game when it was bad. And then, over time, the game got better and just like that, people started feeling better about it. The "worship propagated" here is exactly because the company came through, fixed the game and keeps developing it. And that's good.
            Yeah, but this guy wants to make shit up to justify to themselves why they are right and everyone else is wrong.
        Yeah, I see that statement time and time again, and then I see from the same people how much they can't wait for a new game to be ready for pre-order.
        > game developers are liars and shouldn’t be trusted

This is unfortunately the state of the industry these days. You can't trust developers or publishers.

Even if you think they have their heart in the right place, you never know what kinds of compatibility problems exist, game breaking bugs, or sequels that just have bad gameplay.

You can't trust reviewers who get early access to games because that industry has been compromised. If a game gets panned by a reviewer, they will never get another review copy of a game from that publisher again. It's a quid pro quo system and early review copies are reviewers lifeblood.
        It’s definitely a valid opinion, anybody with a critical outlook on the game gets downvoted even if it’s a valid opinion or statement. Reddit is a platform that was made to encourage open discussion, not censor people who hold differing opinion to others.
relationships with you must be fantastic with this level of “i just absolutely cannot ever possibly let shit go. ever.”
And that was commentary from "SniffMyRapeHole." Now, to sports
    I might have even found some iota of wisdom in what they were saying if it wasn't for that name.
Sounds like a steam problem to some extent
    I mean, release a functional game with the features you promise and refund polices are moot, no?
        But if you don’t like the game you can just refund it.
            Please reread what I posted
    Lmao

    The right answer is honesty. He didn’t “hype the game a bit much” he straight up said features were in the game that weren’t. No space battles, no base building, no multiplayer, etc. he didn’t just say “this will be the greatest game you ever play!” He literally told me (us, the viewer) that the game was one thing and had features it most certainly did not have. And they were BIG features that made it a completely different game. 

If they had delayed or he had not said the things he did or explained the office situation I’d have more compassion, but it wasn’t just one instance. It was interview after interview where he just totally lied. I bought the lie.

Game is great now and what I thought I was buying 5 years ago. It’s just a shame that it took five years and destruction of consumer confidence to get there.
        If you don't want to move on, then hold yourself along with Hello Games accountable for your apparent misery. You irresponsibly bought into the hype and are a direct contributor to the gaming industry's shitty practices.

            He's just one of those deeply angry people. It's got nothing to do with HG or video games in general. As Chad Daniels says, he's one of those people that wakes up in the morning and says "How can I be a victim today?"
    A bit
Click to select instead of hold is now an option. On PC, you can press keys on the number row to select dialogue choices. Console users can use the d-pad to quickly select choices.

Overall, the dialogue UI is generally more pleasant to use than it was several years ago.

Alien npcs are largely unchanged in appearance and animations. There are still the 3 original species - Gek, Korvax, and Vy'keen. A few more dialogues were added over time but it's still mostly the originals. There are also rarer Traveller npcs with strange and sometimes rewarding interactions; Their speech does not need translating.

I learned the languages semi-passively by using knowledge stones and monoliths while exploring and doing other things, rather than painstakingly walking up to every npc on stations. I did that a fair bit early on but it got old fast.

You can also build translator upgrades for your exosuit that guarantee a few words in each alien's sentence will be translated even if you don't know them, it's quite helpful, especially when few words are known.

Station interiors look mostly the same with only minor decorative variations. I suspect that may be subject to change in the future based on the focus of procedural structures/interiors added to derelict freighters in Desolation, and town settlements in Frontiers.

        Astroneer is a lot of fun :)

I can relate, it's always an experience coming back to a game and totally forgetting how to do everything lol. There's lots of helpful, friendly people here and on the NMS Discord if you have any questions about the game.

Good luck on your travels!

                Options -> General Options -> Hold to confirm

You still have to hold to begin dialogue with npcs and interact with objects etc., but every in-menu hold is replaced with clicking

    Technological limitation - your save game can only keep track of so many terrain modifications before it starts overwriting old ones.

In the original game concept that wasn't really a problem, as you were unlikely to ever go back to where you had been, but now with having umpteen bases everywhere, it is an obvious issue.

            Minecraft and NMS's save structures are fundamentally different.

Minecraft's save files will inevitably bloat to many Gigabytes in size after enough time and exploration, as every single generated chunk and voxel's state is stored.

NMS generates and completely deletes voxel terrain data as the player moves around, regenerating it again as needed, with only player-made edits being stored in the save.

Unlike Minecraft, NMS is also made with cloud saving in mind. So the number of terrain modifications that can be stored is limited as the save file is ideally kept as small as possible. HG could go the Minecraft route, but at the cost of losing cloud save support and the inevitable massive save bloating.

All that aside, bases are glitched and don't retain terrain edits as they are intended to. Land fills back in long before the base's terrain edit limit is even reached and/or no other edits have been made.
                [deleted]
                    Absolutely, and it is indeed supposed to work like that but doesn't :(

To my knowledge, HG has made several attempts to fix it with no success
                        [deleted]
                            I'm hoping they can fix it too. It would open up so many exciting possibilities for base building!

Good luck out there Traveller, I hope that you can one day (soon) return in full glory with an unburied base <3
            Minecraft uses servers to store your changes.  It also has a miniscule map in comparison to NMS. 

These make it _completely_ different from a technology perspective.

And yes, I get it that this destroys part of the gaming experience, it's been a constant source of complaints ever since base-building wherever you wanted has been a thing.  Originally you could only claim existing base-computers, and these where always placed on a flat piece of land.  Sounds similar to settlements, doesn't it? Cue people complaining they want to build their base anywhere. Hmm.. we've already got people asking to start their own settlements anywhere.
I'm on creative, maybe its a random event, but i haven't started the main story.
I felt bad for Sean Murray, he got so much put on him for the release.
I think it just depends on how you play! It still seems pretty fantasy to me when I play. Well, as fantasy as a sci-fi game gets, but that's because my play style is pretty heavily exploration based. I like finding all the things. ...I have a pet six legged unicorn cat. I can ride it like a knight.

I have the PC version so I never got a disc, unfortunately. With Steam it'd just make us update it. Hopefully someone else can answer that other question. I kind of suspect they'd make it update. Perhaps there's a base version out there somewhere, though?
    If I reinstall on my PlayStation with network disabled, it will run the disc version..  although, we had a Day-1 patch at the time and there's no way to get that anymore.  And that's a good point - I don't think the disc version could load the savegame.
I guess if you don't go to the Nexus, you do avoid all of the people. But the space stations do still have lots of aliens coming and going.
    Yeah but the space stations are pretty much the same as launch. At launch you had ships coming and going as well, and you still had venders and stuff. Now you just have a bit more.
I see. Fair enough and still a good lesson about scope and PR
    Totally agree. NMS gave me a great lesson about pre-ordering games. 

I was so tempted to get cyber punk, but this taught me better.

I’ll probably download NMS again and give it another shot, if it’s so much better, I will be happy to change my review.
        It's so weird because I thought I would hate this game but a different game gave me a fresh perspective on this one.



After I played a game called Starbound I thought maybe it would be my kind of game. That and the famous internet historian video on the whole thing piqued my interest and here we are 100 hours later.
            After no man sky, and drama on the release, I got lost into a game called Dying Light,  l’ve got about 300 hours in that game and I don’t think no man sky is ever going to come close to that playtime lol
        I have been a real expensive headlight....

    I’d argue that his hard work with his team afterwards it’s worth some forgiveness. Mind you I got burned by the game as well at launch. 

5 years us enough, and it’s an old game by now.
        [deleted]
            Hey man, don’t get it misconstrued, if you go to my history you will see that I’m arguing with a NMS fanboy right now about his allegiance to a game that didn’t deliver.

I hate that this happened, I hate that an indie games was marketed as a AAA game, I hate the lies, I hate how bad their PR was when the game launched by them going radio silent for six months, and you better believe I was on all the forums talking about this game and this company.

But I already bought the game. And a PR team isn’t a development team, someone had to do the work to make a better game and in a lot of ways I’m glad that they did. 

In all honesty, I’ll download it again, play it for a few hours, get bored because it’s probably the same thing over and over again, and then uninstall it for a newer, more promising game. 

But I’m never gonna buy anything else from hello games, I just remark that work has been put into the game but I am no longer supporting this company. But work has been done.
    Hey, don't agitate Sean's cult. You must jerk him off daily and totally forgot about the time when he lied and scammed everyone.
I know it's been made less extreme over time. But NMS is still oriented around substantial grinding for resources, repeating very repetitive random encounters. And continously finding the upgrade slots so you can store these resources that you actually need to produce fuel. Just to take off without entering the atmosphere requires fuel, etc. (although cruising endlessly requires no fuel at all). The repetitive nature of the systems, the layouts of the systems, and the predictability of what you're going to find does not help in any way.

At one time, before Sony's beta-people got their hands on it, the game had a different approach: you did not need to grind. You would search out some planet, and the planet would very likely have an upgrade of some kind. If you needed a different resource, traveling the system might be a 20-30minute trek. And then you would get some sort of upgrade along the way, in way of ship or suit improvement, etc. But the game was oriented around getting to the next system, each system being a different challenge to get further.

That game is still under there, but your progress is measured in numbers and storage space, not in progress through the galaxy-map.

Some people prefer that. And they're very loud, and were certainly that during the initial launch of the game. But what is the case is that the game Hello Games made is still kind of an idea that isn't realized, thanks to a set of astonishingly bad tweaks that made a game about exploration into a game about bigger numbers. That part of the game is astonishingly boring - but the game is still played, because of the aesthetic, and the feeling of exploration. In spite of that all the mechanics-changes are trying to avoid that experience.

I'm just pointing out that now, by and large - which is a view that was violently opposed at launch - more people than average play this game for the exploration feel, rather than the .. well.. grinding resources to put into their home-base, so they can dispense with the whole exploration altogether, and just get bigger and bigger numbers.

And that's not strange - because there are a billion games out there that does this type of grinding much better and more addictive.

Not that Sony is ever going to see that - their people will suggest things like this: the grinding mechanics are made enjoyable and addictive, because of the aesthetic and the universe around it. It could all be replaced with a cutscene - all the tech involved is completely superfluous, all the work involved is utterly wasted. But that's how this game is, and really has been since right before launch.

Mission accomplished, if you're working at Sony, obviously.
Is it longer? I feel like its longer. Honestly i was one of the suckers who bought it on release and have downloaded and played it every time they update it.  So far, they have done a great job upgrading it, but its still a far cry from what they advertised it to be.
    Are you joking? It's been around five years.
        Feels like much much longer.  5yrs though? Really? I couldve sworn this game came out like 2012.
            You're definitely joking. The screenshot of Steam literally says it came out in 2016.
Cyberpunks launch was far better than No Mans Sky's lol, it's not even a comparison
    It wasn't. NMS actually went on to fix it for free, CP2077 didn't.
        NMS also ran when it launched. Yes it was buggy as hell. And no it didn't have anywhere what was promised. But CP2077 didn't run at all on most consoles. Barely ran on PC. And nothing that was promised what in the game. 

So yeah NMS and CP2077 had HORRIBLE launches filled with lies and bullshit. But Hello Games came through. I can't say as much for CDPR. Their last "update" was trash. 

As a final thought.. if you don't like the game why are you here?
        That's post launch, but NMS definitely has done a really good job post launch, much better than Cyberpunk so far.  


That's besides the point though

    I'll use the same format as you, because apparently you read and understand it better :

It.Was.Hype.

a couple of month before the game released people were taking Sean Murray's (definitely stupid) words and interpreting in them things he never even said. Tons of idiots (can't use anything else, sorry) here thought that "every atom procedural" meant that all assets in NMS would be computer generated ... not that every visual would be composed of manually created assets. I mean .. how fucking dumb must you be?! 

I even wrote a comment saying that people would be thoroughly disappointed at release if they expected stuff that (still is) technologically impossible, and I got downvoted to minus heighty something.

so, again, Sean Murray didn't help, but 

IT.WAS.HYPE.

            Xanax would probably be better for you rather than some imaginary friend.

Multiplayer was "kind of" in game. https://massivelyop.com/2016/08/10/no-mans-sky-the-non-multiplayer-multiplayer-game/ (sadly the clip has been removed), but I'm sure you can "literally find videos" of what was happening. Finding this link took me exactly 23 seconds.

"The galaxies with real physics and orbit just like real life!" were deliberately scrapped for a much more SciFi'esk and *enjoyable* unrealistically close-knit approach. if you want to "fly" a make-belief spaceship for 45 minutes while watching netflix because that's all you can do during the flight, then by all means play E:D.

You might also want to check the meaning of psychopath, you little irrate narcist.

                    You're really an idiot, aren't you? Do they let you go out of your house alone or do you have to have a chaperone?

your clip is Sean Murray speaking out of his ass indeed, but most of what he says was actually in game (the whole chemical elements you can mix together to get something else) or has been allegedly scraped for *fun*'s sake (like the realistic astronomy).  Notice how he often uses "would" instead of "will" ... that's Sean Murray saying what might one day be possible, you pathetic excuse for a microscopically-brained-primate.

Learn to read and listen .. and maybe try to wrap your head around the fact that English is not everyone's first language ... Du blödes, stupides, unglaublich borniertes mutterfickendes Arschloch. Putain de merde! T'es con comme une porte de prison?!?

        who got scammed?
3 years of development, 5 years of testing.
Rich comment, considering that usually it's the PC versions that are plagued by this sort of issues.  

Played on PC for a while but this is one of those games where I like to sit back on the sofa and relax whilst playing.
Wow. That's a lot of money.

Let's hope that translates to NMS updates years into the future!
    It absolutely does. You often see people here saying "they can charge for the next DLC and I'll pay!", but the reality is they can make the game for 10 years from now without making a single penny in revenue, and still have money in the bank at the end.
        Pretty cool job for life!  I'm glad they're sticking at it.
        Nah fam, they're literally never gonna have to worry about money ever again. All they have to do is invest even a decent chunk of that money properly, and then they can do whatever they want from there, for the rest of their lives.

If I had 70 mil / 20 people, I'd make updates for NMS forever, or as long as was practical, and do it at a leisurely pace without ruining my health or general well being as the game development sector often does. (Due to virtually non-existent employee protections.)

And yeah, that'd be a dream come true. Just being able to play your passion for the rest of your life without destroying your interest due to 'necessity'. Plus the game continues to put out because more updates = more new players.

Can you imagine? It's crazy how they completely leaned into their rather abysmal failure and turned it into a resounding success. The hilarious part is that what they promised and failed to deliver at the beginning, is now completely possible because they have all the time in the world to just work on this game in any way they please.
            if they invest in a good wallet of companies, real state, etc. 10mil they get easily enough to pay everyone there every month a good amount of money. they could use part of that money to help other small game companies make their games a reality. if the game is really good they could just add those people to their company and let them make the game as a Hello Games IP.
        The funny this is I never seen this for other companies except for fromsoft where people will buy the dlcs as soon they come out. I would gladly buy their dlcs just to support them. But since we get it for free I wish they implement some way to support them more.
Okay holy shit. Now I see why they don't have paid DLCs or anything like that. Like, they literally don't need that much money. I also heard that Sean pays himself surprisingly little considering that he's the boss. 

Also, I knew Hello Games was small but - 20 people?? Ubisoft has 19,000 lmao
    Props to Sean
        Absolutely. He has put together one hell of a team!
that is why the updates are free. that makes you think why The Sims is like it is... you need to pay like 800USd to play the game with all the things it has now
One of the reasons they have so much money now is because they had losses earlier got a bunch of tax refunded
    That's not how that works lol

If you make losses and get tax refunded, you don't end up with 70m pound in the bank. Read the documents, it covers their revenue. They're making 15m a year with outgoing of less than 3. That's why they have 70m cash on hand.
        I did read their statements, did you? Its in note 8.

They made $4 million and $5 million in the past 2 years respectively due to government tax credits/grants
No, that's faith in your vision. On the opposite side of the coin you get Star Citizen - which is faith in other's gullibility.

Sean and Hello Games... congratulations on NMS 5th birthday, pulling out of the dread Steam spiral o'doom, and my personal thanks for 3+ years of in-game enjoyment- long may it continue!
Its been the game it was supposed to be since 2018, everything included since then has been extra and free for the last 3 years now. 

I also believe in redemption, clearly you don't I guess. 

>them making it whole shouldn't undo the mistakes

It's not undoing any mistake. Their reputation went to absolute shit for 5 years. It's only just now getting better, after years of basically working for free. Almost like a prison sentence, or at least being put on community service. They "did their time". What more do you exactly want?

5 years ago did you want their studio cancelled and closed as if that would have made the better outcome? Cancel culture... I swear...
    > Cancel culture... I swear...

Reddit: "Fucking cancel culture is ruining everything!"

Cashier: "Sir, this is a McDonalds..."
    >	I also believe in redemption, clearly you don't I guess

People are allowed to be mad, they put out a game then went radio silent for a couple of months after they got called out on its status. 

Honestly though, this sub at that time of turmoil was way better than the game! The drama was too damn good!
        I don’t get people being mad at all, honestly. Disappointed? Sure, but not mad. Correct me if I’m wrong but most people who didn’t like the game upon release could get refunded their money, so what did they lose? Faith in a good game being made? Sure, but that seems like a very immature thing to be mad over. And even more, and immature thing to hold against them. 
Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Eh, anyone can feel however they want, but the game has been spectacular for a few years now, and has just been getting better, in my opinion. I also feel like anyone who’s still upset about it’s release needs to grow up. But that just my personal feelings about it all.
            > Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Not in this age. A tweet doesn’t cost 12 hours and a lot of man hours to put out.  Especially when they were developing the game and they were tweeting all over the place up until the launch. How does that make sense?

Immature to hold against them? They are a company that delivered a product that was poor. If you’re new to gaming, you must be new to the complaints  gamers have about all sorts of products. It is not immature to want the features they promised.

It would be immature and naïve to assume game developers shouldn’t communicate with their consumers. Who doesn’t do that? 

As much as I hate Todd Howard, he delivered a better game with Skyrim. And when it came out buggy, they communicated and fixed it which is why that game is legendary and no man sky will be only legendary for fixing a mistake.

Hell even this announcement is odd isn’t it? Like they are on the special because they are fixing a problem, no other reason. That’s a low bar.

Also as a gaming consumer, you don’t want to get developers in this habit of delivering piss poor products with the promise of fixing it much later.
                This was a game that got too hyped up because of communicating too much. A game that had high hopes that couldn’t be met with their resources and time. I think radio silence was the smartest move for them. 

Yes, it’s immature to hold a grudge on a small dev group that is clearly trying to make a game they love. I understand that they didn’t give what was promised but honestly? It doesn’t fucking matter. They’re trying their hardest to improve the game and it’s better now than it ever could have been at launch, and it has nothing to do with promises or talking to their fan base, but simply caring about their product. 

No Man’s Sky may be legendary to you only for fixing a mistake, but that’s not the case for everyone. They made a mediocre glitchy game to start and then built upon it. I’m sorry that you can’t move past what it was, but some of us can. 

I’ll die on the hill that living with grudges and always holding mistakes above peoples heads forever is immature, and shows a lack of growth in character. 

You can feel however you want about this game but anger is an immature emotion to feel about something so inconsequential as a video game. I’ve never felt angry when a game fails to live up to its expectations and promises because I know how hard being an artist is. No matter how grand the idea, it’s only as good as how you execute it. 

They had a bad launch but I believe wholeheartedly that every step that they’ve taken since then has been the right one. They’ve redeemed themselves, and they kept going. 

Also, I don’t think that I fully agree with your final statement. I think that a game as vast and exploration based as NMS benefits from being released as a base and then being built upon. I think if they had thought of doing it that way initially, they could’ve made the base game better, admittedly, but used that foundation to do what they’ve done, which I think is ultimately successful and a relatively reasonable model. I think it’s a very stagnant mindset to expect everything to work the same way all the time, and anything that diverts from the standard flow is unacceptable. 

They’ve done well, regardless of what you think, and deserve every bit of praise that they get. But we’re allowed to disagree, otherwise, this world would be a rather stagnant place, no?
        Sure they are, no-one said they aren't allowed to be mad. But after they've more than made up for it by now, it make them look childish and immature to not be capable for moving on.
            I mean that’s what people did, they moved on. The game came out in 2016, and lots video games have been coming out that have been phenomenal since then, with better releases and without drama.

I would argue it kind of hurts the industry to not give those developers props for better releases.
                ??? one company being commended for providing free updates and fixing and expanding their game beyond the original vision doesn't mean other developers aren't getting props for their release. That doesn't make any sense. I'm getting the feeling you haven't even played the game since release to be honest.
                    Beyond their original vision? No man, this is their vision realized.

And  I think you’re confusing “free” updates with “required” updates. as in hello games required these updates if they ever wanted to function as a game company ever again. 

Their reputations were on the line,  and no one is bound to play a bad game in hopes of it getting better. 

Hello game situation is unique, but in most cases developers would walk away. Someone who had a bad launch knows that players are going to leave to play other games.

Have you been stuck on this game since 2016? Think about how many awesome games you may have missed. Games that were already done at launch. 

Doesn’t seem silly to risk that for another bad launch? what if another video game has a horrible launch, do you have to play it through and wait until they improve it? I’d argue hell no you don’t.

Don’t be a fan boy, be a good consumer.
                        Remember that itemized list of everything promised that was missing from launch? Yea back when the NEXT update came out, they pulled that list out and 95% of it was done...

Infact majority of the games features it has now wasn't even something they promised (some were even things they said would never be in). So yea... that does count as beyond their original vision.

Obviously i haven't only played this game since 2016, this isn't about saying launch nms was fine, it was broken af. This is about saying "awesome! They gave us what was promised and then some. What a great turn of events".

Like seriously, how hard of a concept is it for you to understand that?

What i can't understand is why someone who holds such a grudge against this game keeps coming back to the reddit. Like, you talk about missing out on other games but here you are wasting your time airing your grievance about how the game was 5 years ago 5 years later.

If that isn't the definition of pathetic, idk what is. Just "move on" already ffs
New major update means a lot of bugs. These bugs get fixed really fast but most of the people try out the game right after the update and see these bugs and quit immediately leaving a review "buggy game bad" and don't touch it again.
    I think its more about the mobile game gameplay with 4 hours of waiting time for each part on buildings.
        4 hours, not 2 weeks (very common for mobile games to have wait beyond that), also you cant skip the wait with Micro Transactions. I just think its so people don't grind all the content in one long marathon (which would be very not fun, this kind of content is meant to be segmented over time to be fun)
            I think the problem is that the system works well as a sort of side feature during normal gameplay, but a lot of players are at "end game." Having a timer to check up on your settlement is fine when you have the main quest and other side quests and other timers from the base building questline and are upgrading your equipment...

When you're at the point where your main objective is just going where the solar wind takes you, and the solar wind takes you to this new settlement feature and it can't just be the thing you're doing, that's when it becomes frustrating. Which is why we should be able to pump some kind of resource or units or nanites or something to speed up the process.
                They should have just made it so that it takes a lot more resources to upgrade each building. That way new players will have another thing to work towards and end game players will have something to dump their resources into. The whole waiting time thing is just AIDS.
                The problem is that parts of buildings are split up so you have to go back multiple times. It should be one interaction and then you go away for however many hours, come back and it's finished.
                    Or have each part be immediately interactable with their own timers. So if you have the supplies for the frame but not the roof, you can start construction on that part while you get the other materials. If you have everything you need, you can start construction on all parts and have them all be done in an hour or whatever.
            A few complaints I have heard are mainly regarding the time gating from streamer friends, they want to stream the new content and stuff, but end up just doing older content because of the gating. Makes it a very hard update to stream and showcase content, and these guys are space billionaires so it's not like they missed any content previously.
                I dont really want game mechanics dictated by whats easier for streamers. I want the developers to think about what's best for the gameplay and the mechanics. I'm not saying whether or not they should change the time gating or not but it absolutely shouldn't be so streamers have more content and can make more money, it should be whatever makes the game more fun for the average player.
                    I get what you are saying, but as a non-streamer I absolutely hate time gates
                        I'm not disagreeing with that at all. I just think making design choices based on streamers preferences is not a good way to go about deciding how the mechanics of games work.

Edit: wording
                    Whether anyone likes it or not, streamers are an important aspect that has to be considered from a development and community standpoint. More and more, streamers are becoming a determining factor in a long-term health and viability.
            4 hours two weeks it does not matter tbh. The problem is that you had to wait to throw almost nothing in there then you have to wait again. During the 12 hour total session it takes i could have built 100 similar landing pad. In a game if its not mobile game idling timers are just stupid and unnecessary. The game supposed to engage the player and not to make them go away and then come back for 3 minutes to perform a click just to wait another 4 hours.
Make the settlement building engaging. Force the player (By making actuall high rsc needs for buildings) to either actually grind the resources for the building or buy it. Atleast we would have some use for units after buying our dream ships and freighter.
            Better then having to wait a year to have your city completed. You should be able to speed it up atleast with batteries or some shit.
                Seriously. It's painful seeing my settlement just get farther and farther into debt faster than things can build.
                    I'm not having the same experience. I'm on my 7th building and my debt is only about 175k. I did choose mostly production boosting buildings first off. So the income is healthy.

Also I went to multiple settlements and looked at stats before claiming one. My first was just a test run just to figure out mechanics. Found and claimed a new one shortly after.
                        I also looked at about a dozen or so and couldn't find one better than C class.
    Yeah, Steam reviews just aren't very reliable. In my experience the bugs mostly have to do with textures loading in, definitely nothing that constitutes a negative review. (especially in a world where games like Cyberpunk and ARK exist)

Granted I waited until friday to play the update, but that's when it went on sale anyways (I've had the game since Origins), and thus when all the new people flooded in.
    Or perhaps we don't like the game as it is today? P
Because the new update turned the game into a buggy mess, combined with the fact that the new update gave the game a lot of exposure on steam so that many new players had their first day in game being just after it was broken by frontiers...

It's not hard to see how that would farm you some negative reviews.

They *really* need to be fixing the rest of what was broken sooner rather than later. Combining the game's high exposure days with it's high bug count days isn't good.
I’m one of those. Once Frontiers made the universe feel alive I really felt like we’d come full circle and changed my review. 

Also I’d kind of forgotten I’d rated it negatively back when it launched. I’m glad I reinstalled!!
That's absolutely allowed. Steam won't let you add a second review but will let you edit an old one or delete it. I recently changed my review of another game from recommended to not recommended due to what the asinine developers are doing to that game.
    Should I ask what game that is?
        I immediately thought "world of warcraft" lol... i know it's not but it fits the description lol
            I got into wow again a month before the whole shitshow happened and was keen to play it, then just stopped subbing. Hope blizzard sorts their shit out
                Yeah I did too. I rerolled, leveled my Alliance (the ratio is another mess) char up. Just got into the Maw for the first time and started to noticed less and less of the guild was online. I asked,, and unsubbed.
    What game is that, so I can avoid it too!
There was quite a big campaign on the subreddit here reminding people to change their reviews.
Just seems odd that it happened all at the same time and it didn’t happen before.
    Maybe a big update came out? Origins came out in September 2020, and I remember everyone saying "now we've finally got the game they'd promised" and "NMS is finally good".
        Don't forget covid struck. A lot of people may have started playing again after not for a long time do to quarantine and found the improvements.
            Oh yeah, I forgot about Covid

...is a phrase that most people probably won't say for a while...

but I actually did.
                Amnesia one of the side-effects. :-D
                    Nah man, that a different game series. /s
                I keep forgetting that its been a fucking year since it started. It feels like that shit started like 4 or 5 months ago
                    I feel you man it's been a long 2020
                    We're approaching two years.

And I would hold onto my pants, because due to various circumstances I won't bother getting into, doesn't seem like it will be going away for a while.

Nerds truly did inherit the Earth when the COVID-19 update was released for Life.
    I can be wrong, but it seems to be aligned with the Origins release (Sept 2020). Which would make sense, as this was (in my book) by far the best update.
        The down tick started in the beginning of 2020, Origins released September 2020.
You can redo your review at any time as long as you have the game.
You can indeed change your review later.
That’s normal but to that extreme fluctuation isn’t do they get those statistics solely from Steam reviews?
    Like people said above it's probably just because of an update which reminded them to change their review. As for Steam250 I believe they pull all their live data directly from Steam reviews
    "Extreme fluctuation?" It's 1,000 reviews of nearly 50,000 negative reviews. That's barely 2%.
They definitely made it into a 60$ game, when it came it it definitely wasn’t which is pretty much proven by the fact the active players a day went from a quarter of a million to the hundreds in less than two months on Steam.
I know that, I just mean it goes on sale way more often than the game updates. Did you even look at it? It went on sale 7 times this year alone. There has not been 7 updates this year.
Would we be able to play together if we were on separate sources?
    You can, but voice communication would be difficult. I’ve had to play with my step son on his Xbox and me on pc while he uses discord on his tablet
        Couldn’t you just use the Xbox app on your Pc? 

I do that to play Forza with a friend who is on Xbox
            Oh... I never thought of that. I have everything Xbox disabled because it was Messing with rocket league a while back and I had forgotten that I had it. Great idea
                It’s not the best platform on PC but it’s much simpler for the other party, and sound quality should be better than on a tablet.
                    I imagine that a headset can be pluged as on a phone, or with a usb OTG.
        That's what Discord is for! 😁
    About all I read you can play cross platform, there is no cross save game (xbox to PS to PC)

            [Outdated]
Lol wtf
That guy's comment was decidedly not r/rimjob_steve material
And Sony for promoting what was essentially an indie game as a big triple A release. No way it could've lived up to expectations at launch
That the gameplay loop isn't a thing and isn't pushing me to do anything is precisely why I love the game. There are a million games I can play to linearly progress through a bunch of pre-determined series of events, and that's been more or less the definition of a video game for decades. It's nice to have an endless expanse and lots of options for things to do where I can just relax and go about whatever I please at whatever pace suits my energy/attention levels in that moment.
    Booooooo. Honestly I've rated the game down for its lack of depth and boring gameplay loop. People like you who defend that and say "actually less is more" are terrifying to me as you allow companies to get away with the absolute bare minimum. Let me elaborate.. 

A sandbox game is great if only two things are accomplished 

1. The player is given fun toys. NMS has done this.

2. The game has given players ways to utilize these toys. NMS has not done this.

This results in an aimless gameplay loop where the player can get "stuff" but there is nothing to do with said "stuff". For example.. You can get a mech. Awesome. What can you do with mech? What practical application is there? Does it allow you to do something you could not do before, like go to a special planet or get a special item? We know the answer obviously, but this is the depth issue that NMS suffers from.

Not to mention to be a game *centered* around exoration, the exploration *sucks* in this game. Once you've seen 5 planets you've effectively seen them all. There is no real sense of exploration, no matter where you go. Just big rolling hills, deep chasms the look ugly as sin 99% of time and a static sea level. No changes in biome, unique geographical features, just the same boring terrain over and over again. The most exciting terrain you'll find is maybe some under sea caves, but that's about it. Now go play valheim and be amazed by what proc gen can accomplish. Rolling meadows, dense mysterious forest and rivers, towering mountain peaks, and vast swamps. 

Hello Games have actually done very little to improve NMS. Most of these updates are useless fluff that adds buggy, half thought out features to the game that nobody cares about or asked for. Then like clock work the sycophants howl on Twitter praising hello games for never giving up, despite the game being announced live service on launch, and pretending like riding on animals or exploring boring derelict freighters are what was missing from this turd turning into a polished gem stone. Multiplayer is still buggy and useless, missions are ab-so-lutely crap, the "story" is a jumbled mess of incomprehensible pseudo-intellectualism that is presented in the most un inspired lazily way (another hot take, its similar to foullout 76's format of telling the story through "chasing ghost" except even that game had some sense to add good environmental story telling to keep it from being boring).

I know I'm going to get downvoted to hell, but honestly your comment just really bothers me. You all are so willing to except such a sub par product and put it on such a high pedestal.. its like looking at a cult.
        > You all are so willing to except such a sub par product and put it on such a high pedestal.. its like looking at a cult.

This is exactly how I feel every time I read any of the Nintendo or Nintendo game subs. 

Really don't understand how some game developers get absolutely crucified for making even the tiniest mistake but others can get away with doing the bare minimum or less and be praised for it. 

I wouldn't say your critique of NMS is entirely fair but overall I agree with the sentiment.
            I totally agree! Nintendo bugs the hell out of me too! They absolutely get by doing the bare minimum.
        Hey, calm down maybe? The fact that it terrifies you and enrages you that different people like different things than you do is borderline sociopathy. You've got a lot of growing to do to be able to accept that not everyone is going to fit your cookie cutter shape, and that's OK, because there are other shapes and they are great too in their own way.
            Hearing critiscm about a game prompts you to call the critic a sociopath? That's very healthy behavior. I never once insulted you, I just gave a very well thought out opinion. Maybe you should relaxe and re evaluate some things.
That’s not an apt analogy. You’re saying that even if you received the wrong product from Amazon you’d 5 star what you originally ordered anyway?



>	it doesn’t represent the current state of the game 

Right. What’s the issue here? Steam offers “recent reviews” and a cumulative total. Both recent and cumulative offer an accurate picture. It was a trash game at launch but recently it’s really really great. They deserve the hit they took at launch snd deserve the credit for building the game up to what it is now.
It usually isn't the norm.  Normally the devs of a dud game, make a few patches then just move on.
    Anthem anyone?
Terraria dropped a huge patch 10 years into its life cycle
    I still look for terraria updates every time I'm browsing my steam library. A man can hope, right? Ive put like 500 hours into that game. Every new big patch would give me the urge to start from scratch again
Sadly finished now..
A lot of people’s gripes were reasons I liked the game. Since launch this game was my zen game, I would come home from high school stressed as balls and play some NMS to chill out. Nowadays, it’s no different with college.
yup, I’m one of the people that just can’t get into it. it’s a good game and it’s improved astronomically since launch, but I still can’t find anything to hold my attention in it. made it about 60 hours before giving up trying to find stuff that interested me
Fk ARK is such an addictive little cryfest of a game. So much better w mods and improved rates but even so. Awesome awesome game but damn is it a timesink, lol.
    Ark is a strange game. Its brutal and fun. It makes you angry, mad, even maybe keyboard ending but then you want more.

I dont have words for my feelings with Ark. Even Dark Souls isnt as brutal.
        Right?! Like 'omg I just lost all my stuff in this cave and I can't get back and damnit I really needed that gun from that drop, this game sucks I'm just gonna log off.

... okay but I should breed my wolves first and oh right I gotta put fertilizer in the crops and oh wow is that a max level yuty hold on'

Evil, evil, evil game.
Just follow the quests you get, build bases, and explore every new thing you see. Your own goals should start forming before long.

It helps if you have a really, really open mind. Like a 'it's about the journey, not the destination' kind of approach. Way too often, I find myself getting completely derailed from what I was doing previously to pursue some other thing, and I'm totally okay with it.
    I gave it at least 10-15 hours in a single play through (I think I have maybe 30-40 hours total?) and I still wasn’t feeling any impetus to do much of anything. I was building a base but I didn’t know why. I had to go mine stuff and it felt tedious. I like hard games, I like challenging games. I just need some kind of gameplay loop to be evident within a reasonable about of time. NMS is opaque.
Ah, you might want to try an expedition. They are limited time multiplayer events where you start with certain equipment on a specific planet and have to complete specific goals. A new one is starting soon so keep an eye out for it.
[deleted]
    there is dialog, it’s part of some of the main quests.. But I think those do have subtitles
nice whataboutism. Try and think about why this game was the worst reviewed game on steam for a long time and get back to me.

I’ll wait.
Unfortunately no one learns this lesson. Just look at the clearly scam games at Kickstarter that promise impossible things by people with no experience in game development and manage to raise millions in funding.(like dreamworld and ages of elyria), or even at games like cyberpunk
    I mean No Mans Sky helped me dodge Fallout 76 a year later. I remember when the Bethesda devs released that letter like a week before release and it reeked of pure desperation, the "it wont be for everyone" and I went, gee... where have I seen that shit before and remembered Sean Murray's "Your Universe Awaits" letter.

Remember, No preorders.
>	The real lesson to learn from that is not to pre-order or buy games right after release

The subtext to this “lesson” is that game developers are liars and shouldn’t be trusted. NMS is good but I can’t support the Hello Games worship propagated by people in this sub.
    > I can’t support the Hello Games worship propagated by people in this sub.

Go back five years and see this sub then. Many of the top posts of all time are still from that time. See how negative a lot of people were about the game when it was bad. And then, over time, the game got better and just like that, people started feeling better about it. The "worship propagated" here is exactly because the company came through, fixed the game and keeps developing it. And that's good.
        Yeah, but this guy wants to make shit up to justify to themselves why they are right and everyone else is wrong.
    Yeah, I see that statement time and time again, and then I see from the same people how much they can't wait for a new game to be ready for pre-order.
    > game developers are liars and shouldn’t be trusted

This is unfortunately the state of the industry these days. You can't trust developers or publishers.

Even if you think they have their heart in the right place, you never know what kinds of compatibility problems exist, game breaking bugs, or sequels that just have bad gameplay.

You can't trust reviewers who get early access to games because that industry has been compromised. If a game gets panned by a reviewer, they will never get another review copy of a game from that publisher again. It's a quid pro quo system and early review copies are reviewers lifeblood.
    It’s definitely a valid opinion, anybody with a critical outlook on the game gets downvoted even if it’s a valid opinion or statement. Reddit is a platform that was made to encourage open discussion, not censor people who hold differing opinion to others.
I might have even found some iota of wisdom in what they were saying if it wasn't for that name.
I mean, release a functional game with the features you promise and refund polices are moot, no?
    But if you don’t like the game you can just refund it.
        Please reread what I posted
Lmao
The right answer is honesty. He didn’t “hype the game a bit much” he straight up said features were in the game that weren’t. No space battles, no base building, no multiplayer, etc. he didn’t just say “this will be the greatest game you ever play!” He literally told me (us, the viewer) that the game was one thing and had features it most certainly did not have. And they were BIG features that made it a completely different game. 

If they had delayed or he had not said the things he did or explained the office situation I’d have more compassion, but it wasn’t just one instance. It was interview after interview where he just totally lied. I bought the lie.

Game is great now and what I thought I was buying 5 years ago. It’s just a shame that it took five years and destruction of consumer confidence to get there.
    If you don't want to move on, then hold yourself along with Hello Games accountable for your apparent misery. You irresponsibly bought into the hype and are a direct contributor to the gaming industry's shitty practices.

    Astroneer is a lot of fun :)

I can relate, it's always an experience coming back to a game and totally forgetting how to do everything lol. There's lots of helpful, friendly people here and on the NMS Discord if you have any questions about the game.

Good luck on your travels!

            Options -> General Options -> Hold to confirm

You still have to hold to begin dialogue with npcs and interact with objects etc., but every in-menu hold is replaced with clicking
Technological limitation - your save game can only keep track of so many terrain modifications before it starts overwriting old ones.

In the original game concept that wasn't really a problem, as you were unlikely to ever go back to where you had been, but now with having umpteen bases everywhere, it is an obvious issue.
    [deleted]
        Minecraft and NMS's save structures are fundamentally different.

Minecraft's save files will inevitably bloat to many Gigabytes in size after enough time and exploration, as every single generated chunk and voxel's state is stored.

NMS generates and completely deletes voxel terrain data as the player moves around, regenerating it again as needed, with only player-made edits being stored in the save.

Unlike Minecraft, NMS is also made with cloud saving in mind. So the number of terrain modifications that can be stored is limited as the save file is ideally kept as small as possible. HG could go the Minecraft route, but at the cost of losing cloud save support and the inevitable massive save bloating.

All that aside, bases are glitched and don't retain terrain edits as they are intended to. Land fills back in long before the base's terrain edit limit is even reached and/or no other edits have been made.
            [deleted]
                Absolutely, and it is indeed supposed to work like that but doesn't :(

To my knowledge, HG has made several attempts to fix it with no success
                    [deleted]
                        I'm hoping they can fix it too. It would open up so many exciting possibilities for base building!

Good luck out there Traveller, I hope that you can one day (soon) return in full glory with an unburied base <3
        Minecraft uses servers to store your changes.  It also has a miniscule map in comparison to NMS. 

These make it _completely_ different from a technology perspective.

And yes, I get it that this destroys part of the gaming experience, it's been a constant source of complaints ever since base-building wherever you wanted has been a thing.  Originally you could only claim existing base-computers, and these where always placed on a flat piece of land.  Sounds similar to settlements, doesn't it? Cue people complaining they want to build their base anywhere. Hmm.. we've already got people asking to start their own settlements anywhere.
If I reinstall on my PlayStation with network disabled, it will run the disc version..  although, we had a Day-1 patch at the time and there's no way to get that anymore.  And that's a good point - I don't think the disc version could load the savegame.
Yeah but the space stations are pretty much the same as launch. At launch you had ships coming and going as well, and you still had venders and stuff. Now you just have a bit more.
Totally agree. NMS gave me a great lesson about pre-ordering games. 

I was so tempted to get cyber punk, but this taught me better.

I’ll probably download NMS again and give it another shot, if it’s so much better, I will be happy to change my review.
    It's so weird because I thought I would hate this game but a different game gave me a fresh perspective on this one.



After I played a game called Starbound I thought maybe it would be my kind of game. That and the famous internet historian video on the whole thing piqued my interest and here we are 100 hours later.
        After no man sky, and drama on the release, I got lost into a game called Dying Light,  l’ve got about 300 hours in that game and I don’t think no man sky is ever going to come close to that playtime lol
    I have been a real expensive headlight....
I’d argue that his hard work with his team afterwards it’s worth some forgiveness. Mind you I got burned by the game as well at launch. 

5 years us enough, and it’s an old game by now.
    [deleted]
        Hey man, don’t get it misconstrued, if you go to my history you will see that I’m arguing with a NMS fanboy right now about his allegiance to a game that didn’t deliver.

I hate that this happened, I hate that an indie games was marketed as a AAA game, I hate the lies, I hate how bad their PR was when the game launched by them going radio silent for six months, and you better believe I was on all the forums talking about this game and this company.

But I already bought the game. And a PR team isn’t a development team, someone had to do the work to make a better game and in a lot of ways I’m glad that they did. 

In all honesty, I’ll download it again, play it for a few hours, get bored because it’s probably the same thing over and over again, and then uninstall it for a newer, more promising game. 

But I’m never gonna buy anything else from hello games, I just remark that work has been put into the game but I am no longer supporting this company. But work has been done.
Hey, don't agitate Sean's cult. You must jerk him off daily and totally forgot about the time when he lied and scammed everyone.
Are you joking? It's been around five years.
    Feels like much much longer.  5yrs though? Really? I couldve sworn this game came out like 2012.
        You're definitely joking. The screenshot of Steam literally says it came out in 2016.
It wasn't. NMS actually went on to fix it for free, CP2077 didn't.
    NMS also ran when it launched. Yes it was buggy as hell. And no it didn't have anywhere what was promised. But CP2077 didn't run at all on most consoles. Barely ran on PC. And nothing that was promised what in the game. 

So yeah NMS and CP2077 had HORRIBLE launches filled with lies and bullshit. But Hello Games came through. I can't say as much for CDPR. Their last "update" was trash. 

As a final thought.. if you don't like the game why are you here?
    That's post launch, but NMS definitely has done a really good job post launch, much better than Cyberpunk so far.  


That's besides the point though
I'll use the same format as you, because apparently you read and understand it better :

It.Was.Hype.

a couple of month before the game released people were taking Sean Murray's (definitely stupid) words and interpreting in them things he never even said. Tons of idiots (can't use anything else, sorry) here thought that "every atom procedural" meant that all assets in NMS would be computer generated ... not that every visual would be composed of manually created assets. I mean .. how fucking dumb must you be?! 

I even wrote a comment saying that people would be thoroughly disappointed at release if they expected stuff that (still is) technologically impossible, and I got downvoted to minus heighty something.

so, again, Sean Murray didn't help, but 

IT.WAS.HYPE.

Multiplayer was "kind of" in game. https://massivelyop.com/2016/08/10/no-mans-sky-the-non-multiplayer-multiplayer-game/ (sadly the clip has been removed), but I'm sure you can "literally find videos" of what was happening. Finding this link took me exactly 23 seconds.

"The galaxies with real physics and orbit just like real life!" were deliberately scrapped for a much more SciFi'esk and *enjoyable* unrealistically close-knit approach. if you want to "fly" a make-belief spaceship for 45 minutes while watching netflix because that's all you can do during the flight, then by all means play E:D.

You might also want to check the meaning of psychopath, you little irrate narcist.

your clip is Sean Murray speaking out of his ass indeed, but most of what he says was actually in game (the whole chemical elements you can mix together to get something else) or has been allegedly scraped for *fun*'s sake (like the realistic astronomy).  Notice how he often uses "would" instead of "will" ... that's Sean Murray saying what might one day be possible, you pathetic excuse for a microscopically-brained-primate.

Learn to read and listen .. and maybe try to wrap your head around the fact that English is not everyone's first language ... Du blödes, stupides, unglaublich borniertes mutterfickendes Arschloch. Putain de merde! T'es con comme une porte de prison?!?

    who got scammed?
It absolutely does. You often see people here saying "they can charge for the next DLC and I'll pay!", but the reality is they can make the game for 10 years from now without making a single penny in revenue, and still have money in the bank at the end.
    Pretty cool job for life!  I'm glad they're sticking at it.
    Nah fam, they're literally never gonna have to worry about money ever again. All they have to do is invest even a decent chunk of that money properly, and then they can do whatever they want from there, for the rest of their lives.

If I had 70 mil / 20 people, I'd make updates for NMS forever, or as long as was practical, and do it at a leisurely pace without ruining my health or general well being as the game development sector often does. (Due to virtually non-existent employee protections.)

And yeah, that'd be a dream come true. Just being able to play your passion for the rest of your life without destroying your interest due to 'necessity'. Plus the game continues to put out because more updates = more new players.

Can you imagine? It's crazy how they completely leaned into their rather abysmal failure and turned it into a resounding success. The hilarious part is that what they promised and failed to deliver at the beginning, is now completely possible because they have all the time in the world to just work on this game in any way they please.
        if they invest in a good wallet of companies, real state, etc. 10mil they get easily enough to pay everyone there every month a good amount of money. they could use part of that money to help other small game companies make their games a reality. if the game is really good they could just add those people to their company and let them make the game as a Hello Games IP.
    The funny this is I never seen this for other companies except for fromsoft where people will buy the dlcs as soon they come out. I would gladly buy their dlcs just to support them. But since we get it for free I wish they implement some way to support them more.
Props to Sean
    Absolutely. He has put together one hell of a team!
That's not how that works lol

If you make losses and get tax refunded, you don't end up with 70m pound in the bank. Read the documents, it covers their revenue. They're making 15m a year with outgoing of less than 3. That's why they have 70m cash on hand.
    I did read their statements, did you? Its in note 8.

They made $4 million and $5 million in the past 2 years respectively due to government tax credits/grants

People are allowed to be mad, they put out a game then went radio silent for a couple of months after they got called out on its status. 

Honestly though, this sub at that time of turmoil was way better than the game! The drama was too damn good!
    I don’t get people being mad at all, honestly. Disappointed? Sure, but not mad. Correct me if I’m wrong but most people who didn’t like the game upon release could get refunded their money, so what did they lose? Faith in a good game being made? Sure, but that seems like a very immature thing to be mad over. And even more, and immature thing to hold against them. 
Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Eh, anyone can feel however they want, but the game has been spectacular for a few years now, and has just been getting better, in my opinion. I also feel like anyone who’s still upset about it’s release needs to grow up. But that just my personal feelings about it all.
        > Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Not in this age. A tweet doesn’t cost 12 hours and a lot of man hours to put out.  Especially when they were developing the game and they were tweeting all over the place up until the launch. How does that make sense?

Immature to hold against them? They are a company that delivered a product that was poor. If you’re new to gaming, you must be new to the complaints  gamers have about all sorts of products. It is not immature to want the features they promised.

It would be immature and naïve to assume game developers shouldn’t communicate with their consumers. Who doesn’t do that? 

As much as I hate Todd Howard, he delivered a better game with Skyrim. And when it came out buggy, they communicated and fixed it which is why that game is legendary and no man sky will be only legendary for fixing a mistake.

Hell even this announcement is odd isn’t it? Like they are on the special because they are fixing a problem, no other reason. That’s a low bar.

Also as a gaming consumer, you don’t want to get developers in this habit of delivering piss poor products with the promise of fixing it much later.
            This was a game that got too hyped up because of communicating too much. A game that had high hopes that couldn’t be met with their resources and time. I think radio silence was the smartest move for them. 

Yes, it’s immature to hold a grudge on a small dev group that is clearly trying to make a game they love. I understand that they didn’t give what was promised but honestly? It doesn’t fucking matter. They’re trying their hardest to improve the game and it’s better now than it ever could have been at launch, and it has nothing to do with promises or talking to their fan base, but simply caring about their product. 

No Man’s Sky may be legendary to you only for fixing a mistake, but that’s not the case for everyone. They made a mediocre glitchy game to start and then built upon it. I’m sorry that you can’t move past what it was, but some of us can. 

I’ll die on the hill that living with grudges and always holding mistakes above peoples heads forever is immature, and shows a lack of growth in character. 

You can feel however you want about this game but anger is an immature emotion to feel about something so inconsequential as a video game. I’ve never felt angry when a game fails to live up to its expectations and promises because I know how hard being an artist is. No matter how grand the idea, it’s only as good as how you execute it. 

They had a bad launch but I believe wholeheartedly that every step that they’ve taken since then has been the right one. They’ve redeemed themselves, and they kept going. 

Also, I don’t think that I fully agree with your final statement. I think that a game as vast and exploration based as NMS benefits from being released as a base and then being built upon. I think if they had thought of doing it that way initially, they could’ve made the base game better, admittedly, but used that foundation to do what they’ve done, which I think is ultimately successful and a relatively reasonable model. I think it’s a very stagnant mindset to expect everything to work the same way all the time, and anything that diverts from the standard flow is unacceptable. 

They’ve done well, regardless of what you think, and deserve every bit of praise that they get. But we’re allowed to disagree, otherwise, this world would be a rather stagnant place, no?
    Sure they are, no-one said they aren't allowed to be mad. But after they've more than made up for it by now, it make them look childish and immature to not be capable for moving on.
        I mean that’s what people did, they moved on. The game came out in 2016, and lots video games have been coming out that have been phenomenal since then, with better releases and without drama.

I would argue it kind of hurts the industry to not give those developers props for better releases.
            ??? one company being commended for providing free updates and fixing and expanding their game beyond the original vision doesn't mean other developers aren't getting props for their release. That doesn't make any sense. I'm getting the feeling you haven't even played the game since release to be honest.
                Beyond their original vision? No man, this is their vision realized.

And  I think you’re confusing “free” updates with “required” updates. as in hello games required these updates if they ever wanted to function as a game company ever again. 

Their reputations were on the line,  and no one is bound to play a bad game in hopes of it getting better. 

Hello game situation is unique, but in most cases developers would walk away. Someone who had a bad launch knows that players are going to leave to play other games.

Have you been stuck on this game since 2016? Think about how many awesome games you may have missed. Games that were already done at launch. 

Doesn’t seem silly to risk that for another bad launch? what if another video game has a horrible launch, do you have to play it through and wait until they improve it? I’d argue hell no you don’t.

Don’t be a fan boy, be a good consumer.
                    Remember that itemized list of everything promised that was missing from launch? Yea back when the NEXT update came out, they pulled that list out and 95% of it was done...

Infact majority of the games features it has now wasn't even something they promised (some were even things they said would never be in). So yea... that does count as beyond their original vision.

Obviously i haven't only played this game since 2016, this isn't about saying launch nms was fine, it was broken af. This is about saying "awesome! They gave us what was promised and then some. What a great turn of events".

Like seriously, how hard of a concept is it for you to understand that?

What i can't understand is why someone who holds such a grudge against this game keeps coming back to the reddit. Like, you talk about missing out on other games but here you are wasting your time airing your grievance about how the game was 5 years ago 5 years later.

If that isn't the definition of pathetic, idk what is. Just "move on" already ffs
I think its more about the mobile game gameplay with 4 hours of waiting time for each part on buildings.
    4 hours, not 2 weeks (very common for mobile games to have wait beyond that), also you cant skip the wait with Micro Transactions. I just think its so people don't grind all the content in one long marathon (which would be very not fun, this kind of content is meant to be segmented over time to be fun)
        I think the problem is that the system works well as a sort of side feature during normal gameplay, but a lot of players are at "end game." Having a timer to check up on your settlement is fine when you have the main quest and other side quests and other timers from the base building questline and are upgrading your equipment...

When you're at the point where your main objective is just going where the solar wind takes you, and the solar wind takes you to this new settlement feature and it can't just be the thing you're doing, that's when it becomes frustrating. Which is why we should be able to pump some kind of resource or units or nanites or something to speed up the process.
            They should have just made it so that it takes a lot more resources to upgrade each building. That way new players will have another thing to work towards and end game players will have something to dump their resources into. The whole waiting time thing is just AIDS.
            The problem is that parts of buildings are split up so you have to go back multiple times. It should be one interaction and then you go away for however many hours, come back and it's finished.
                Or have each part be immediately interactable with their own timers. So if you have the supplies for the frame but not the roof, you can start construction on that part while you get the other materials. If you have everything you need, you can start construction on all parts and have them all be done in an hour or whatever.
        A few complaints I have heard are mainly regarding the time gating from streamer friends, they want to stream the new content and stuff, but end up just doing older content because of the gating. Makes it a very hard update to stream and showcase content, and these guys are space billionaires so it's not like they missed any content previously.
            I dont really want game mechanics dictated by whats easier for streamers. I want the developers to think about what's best for the gameplay and the mechanics. I'm not saying whether or not they should change the time gating or not but it absolutely shouldn't be so streamers have more content and can make more money, it should be whatever makes the game more fun for the average player.
                I get what you are saying, but as a non-streamer I absolutely hate time gates
                    I'm not disagreeing with that at all. I just think making design choices based on streamers preferences is not a good way to go about deciding how the mechanics of games work.

Edit: wording
                Whether anyone likes it or not, streamers are an important aspect that has to be considered from a development and community standpoint. More and more, streamers are becoming a determining factor in a long-term health and viability.
        4 hours two weeks it does not matter tbh. The problem is that you had to wait to throw almost nothing in there then you have to wait again. During the 12 hour total session it takes i could have built 100 similar landing pad. In a game if its not mobile game idling timers are just stupid and unnecessary. The game supposed to engage the player and not to make them go away and then come back for 3 minutes to perform a click just to wait another 4 hours.
Make the settlement building engaging. Force the player (By making actuall high rsc needs for buildings) to either actually grind the resources for the building or buy it. Atleast we would have some use for units after buying our dream ships and freighter.
        Better then having to wait a year to have your city completed. You should be able to speed it up atleast with batteries or some shit.
            Seriously. It's painful seeing my settlement just get farther and farther into debt faster than things can build.
                I'm not having the same experience. I'm on my 7th building and my debt is only about 175k. I did choose mostly production boosting buildings first off. So the income is healthy.

Also I went to multiple settlements and looked at stats before claiming one. My first was just a test run just to figure out mechanics. Found and claimed a new one shortly after.
                    I also looked at about a dozen or so and couldn't find one better than C class.
Yeah, Steam reviews just aren't very reliable. In my experience the bugs mostly have to do with textures loading in, definitely nothing that constitutes a negative review. (especially in a world where games like Cyberpunk and ARK exist)

Granted I waited until friday to play the update, but that's when it went on sale anyways (I've had the game since Origins), and thus when all the new people flooded in.
Or perhaps we don't like the game as it is today? P
Should I ask what game that is?
    I immediately thought "world of warcraft" lol... i know it's not but it fits the description lol
        I got into wow again a month before the whole shitshow happened and was keen to play it, then just stopped subbing. Hope blizzard sorts their shit out
            Yeah I did too. I rerolled, leveled my Alliance (the ratio is another mess) char up. Just got into the Maw for the first time and started to noticed less and less of the guild was online. I asked,, and unsubbed.
What game is that, so I can avoid it too!
Maybe a big update came out? Origins came out in September 2020, and I remember everyone saying "now we've finally got the game they'd promised" and "NMS is finally good".
    Don't forget covid struck. A lot of people may have started playing again after not for a long time do to quarantine and found the improvements.
        Oh yeah, I forgot about Covid

...is a phrase that most people probably won't say for a while...

but I actually did.
            Amnesia one of the side-effects. :-D
                Nah man, that a different game series. /s
            I keep forgetting that its been a fucking year since it started. It feels like that shit started like 4 or 5 months ago
                I feel you man it's been a long 2020
                We're approaching two years.

And I would hold onto my pants, because due to various circumstances I won't bother getting into, doesn't seem like it will be going away for a while.

Nerds truly did inherit the Earth when the COVID-19 update was released for Life.
I can be wrong, but it seems to be aligned with the Origins release (Sept 2020). Which would make sense, as this was (in my book) by far the best update.
    The down tick started in the beginning of 2020, Origins released September 2020.
Like people said above it's probably just because of an update which reminded them to change their review. As for Steam250 I believe they pull all their live data directly from Steam reviews
"Extreme fluctuation?" It's 1,000 reviews of nearly 50,000 negative reviews. That's barely 2%.
You can, but voice communication would be difficult. I’ve had to play with my step son on his Xbox and me on pc while he uses discord on his tablet
    Couldn’t you just use the Xbox app on your Pc? 

I do that to play Forza with a friend who is on Xbox
        Oh... I never thought of that. I have everything Xbox disabled because it was Messing with rocket league a while back and I had forgotten that I had it. Great idea
            It’s not the best platform on PC but it’s much simpler for the other party, and sound quality should be better than on a tablet.
                I imagine that a headset can be pluged as on a phone, or with a usb OTG.
    That's what Discord is for! 😁
About all I read you can play cross platform, there is no cross save game (xbox to PS to PC)

    Yeah GOG is weird with high-end games like this. So is Epic Games. Though EG is somewhat less so.

Booooooo. Honestly I've rated the game down for its lack of depth and boring gameplay loop. People like you who defend that and say "actually less is more" are terrifying to me as you allow companies to get away with the absolute bare minimum. Let me elaborate.. 

A sandbox game is great if only two things are accomplished 

1. The player is given fun toys. NMS has done this.

2. The game has given players ways to utilize these toys. NMS has not done this.

This results in an aimless gameplay loop where the player can get "stuff" but there is nothing to do with said "stuff". For example.. You can get a mech. Awesome. What can you do with mech? What practical application is there? Does it allow you to do something you could not do before, like go to a special planet or get a special item? We know the answer obviously, but this is the depth issue that NMS suffers from.

Not to mention to be a game *centered* around exoration, the exploration *sucks* in this game. Once you've seen 5 planets you've effectively seen them all. There is no real sense of exploration, no matter where you go. Just big rolling hills, deep chasms the look ugly as sin 99% of time and a static sea level. No changes in biome, unique geographical features, just the same boring terrain over and over again. The most exciting terrain you'll find is maybe some under sea caves, but that's about it. Now go play valheim and be amazed by what proc gen can accomplish. Rolling meadows, dense mysterious forest and rivers, towering mountain peaks, and vast swamps. 

Hello Games have actually done very little to improve NMS. Most of these updates are useless fluff that adds buggy, half thought out features to the game that nobody cares about or asked for. Then like clock work the sycophants howl on Twitter praising hello games for never giving up, despite the game being announced live service on launch, and pretending like riding on animals or exploring boring derelict freighters are what was missing from this turd turning into a polished gem stone. Multiplayer is still buggy and useless, missions are ab-so-lutely crap, the "story" is a jumbled mess of incomprehensible pseudo-intellectualism that is presented in the most un inspired lazily way (another hot take, its similar to foullout 76's format of telling the story through "chasing ghost" except even that game had some sense to add good environmental story telling to keep it from being boring).

I know I'm going to get downvoted to hell, but honestly your comment just really bothers me. You all are so willing to except such a sub par product and put it on such a high pedestal.. its like looking at a cult.
    > You all are so willing to except such a sub par product and put it on such a high pedestal.. its like looking at a cult.

This is exactly how I feel every time I read any of the Nintendo or Nintendo game subs. 

Really don't understand how some game developers get absolutely crucified for making even the tiniest mistake but others can get away with doing the bare minimum or less and be praised for it. 

I wouldn't say your critique of NMS is entirely fair but overall I agree with the sentiment.
        I totally agree! Nintendo bugs the hell out of me too! They absolutely get by doing the bare minimum.
    Hey, calm down maybe? The fact that it terrifies you and enrages you that different people like different things than you do is borderline sociopathy. You've got a lot of growing to do to be able to accept that not everyone is going to fit your cookie cutter shape, and that's OK, because there are other shapes and they are great too in their own way.
        Hearing critiscm about a game prompts you to call the critic a sociopath? That's very healthy behavior. I never once insulted you, I just gave a very well thought out opinion. Maybe you should relaxe and re evaluate some things.
Anthem anyone?
I still look for terraria updates every time I'm browsing my steam library. A man can hope, right? Ive put like 500 hours into that game. Every new big patch would give me the urge to start from scratch again
Ark is a strange game. Its brutal and fun. It makes you angry, mad, even maybe keyboard ending but then you want more.

I dont have words for my feelings with Ark. Even Dark Souls isnt as brutal.
    Right?! Like 'omg I just lost all my stuff in this cave and I can't get back and damnit I really needed that gun from that drop, this game sucks I'm just gonna log off.

... okay but I should breed my wolves first and oh right I gotta put fertilizer in the crops and oh wow is that a max level yuty hold on'

Evil, evil, evil game.
I gave it at least 10-15 hours in a single play through (I think I have maybe 30-40 hours total?) and I still wasn’t feeling any impetus to do much of anything. I was building a base but I didn’t know why. I had to go mine stuff and it felt tedious. I like hard games, I like challenging games. I just need some kind of gameplay loop to be evident within a reasonable about of time. NMS is opaque.
there is dialog, it’s part of some of the main quests.. But I think those do have subtitles
I mean No Mans Sky helped me dodge Fallout 76 a year later. I remember when the Bethesda devs released that letter like a week before release and it reeked of pure desperation, the "it wont be for everyone" and I went, gee... where have I seen that shit before and remembered Sean Murray's "Your Universe Awaits" letter.

Remember, No preorders.
> I can’t support the Hello Games worship propagated by people in this sub.

Go back five years and see this sub then. Many of the top posts of all time are still from that time. See how negative a lot of people were about the game when it was bad. And then, over time, the game got better and just like that, people started feeling better about it. The "worship propagated" here is exactly because the company came through, fixed the game and keeps developing it. And that's good.
    Yeah, but this guy wants to make shit up to justify to themselves why they are right and everyone else is wrong.
Yeah, I see that statement time and time again, and then I see from the same people how much they can't wait for a new game to be ready for pre-order.
> game developers are liars and shouldn’t be trusted

This is unfortunately the state of the industry these days. You can't trust developers or publishers.

Even if you think they have their heart in the right place, you never know what kinds of compatibility problems exist, game breaking bugs, or sequels that just have bad gameplay.

You can't trust reviewers who get early access to games because that industry has been compromised. If a game gets panned by a reviewer, they will never get another review copy of a game from that publisher again. It's a quid pro quo system and early review copies are reviewers lifeblood.
It’s definitely a valid opinion, anybody with a critical outlook on the game gets downvoted even if it’s a valid opinion or statement. Reddit is a platform that was made to encourage open discussion, not censor people who hold differing opinion to others.
But if you don’t like the game you can just refund it.
    Please reread what I posted
If you don't want to move on, then hold yourself along with Hello Games accountable for your apparent misery. You irresponsibly bought into the hype and are a direct contributor to the gaming industry's shitty practices.

    He's just one of those deeply angry people. It's got nothing to do with HG or video games in general. As Chad Daniels says, he's one of those people that wakes up in the morning and says "How can I be a victim today?"
Astroneer is a lot of fun :)

I can relate, it's always an experience coming back to a game and totally forgetting how to do everything lol. There's lots of helpful, friendly people here and on the NMS Discord if you have any questions about the game.

Good luck on your travels!

    Minecraft and NMS's save structures are fundamentally different.

Minecraft's save files will inevitably bloat to many Gigabytes in size after enough time and exploration, as every single generated chunk and voxel's state is stored.

NMS generates and completely deletes voxel terrain data as the player moves around, regenerating it again as needed, with only player-made edits being stored in the save.

Unlike Minecraft, NMS is also made with cloud saving in mind. So the number of terrain modifications that can be stored is limited as the save file is ideally kept as small as possible. HG could go the Minecraft route, but at the cost of losing cloud save support and the inevitable massive save bloating.

All that aside, bases are glitched and don't retain terrain edits as they are intended to. Land fills back in long before the base's terrain edit limit is even reached and/or no other edits have been made.
        [deleted]
            Absolutely, and it is indeed supposed to work like that but doesn't :(

To my knowledge, HG has made several attempts to fix it with no success
                [deleted]
                    I'm hoping they can fix it too. It would open up so many exciting possibilities for base building!

Good luck out there Traveller, I hope that you can one day (soon) return in full glory with an unburied base <3
    Minecraft uses servers to store your changes.  It also has a miniscule map in comparison to NMS. 

These make it _completely_ different from a technology perspective.

And yes, I get it that this destroys part of the gaming experience, it's been a constant source of complaints ever since base-building wherever you wanted has been a thing.  Originally you could only claim existing base-computers, and these where always placed on a flat piece of land.  Sounds similar to settlements, doesn't it? Cue people complaining they want to build their base anywhere. Hmm.. we've already got people asking to start their own settlements anywhere.
It's so weird because I thought I would hate this game but a different game gave me a fresh perspective on this one.



After I played a game called Starbound I thought maybe it would be my kind of game. That and the famous internet historian video on the whole thing piqued my interest and here we are 100 hours later.
    After no man sky, and drama on the release, I got lost into a game called Dying Light,  l’ve got about 300 hours in that game and I don’t think no man sky is ever going to come close to that playtime lol
I have been a real expensive headlight....
[deleted]
    Hey man, don’t get it misconstrued, if you go to my history you will see that I’m arguing with a NMS fanboy right now about his allegiance to a game that didn’t deliver.

I hate that this happened, I hate that an indie games was marketed as a AAA game, I hate the lies, I hate how bad their PR was when the game launched by them going radio silent for six months, and you better believe I was on all the forums talking about this game and this company.

But I already bought the game. And a PR team isn’t a development team, someone had to do the work to make a better game and in a lot of ways I’m glad that they did. 

In all honesty, I’ll download it again, play it for a few hours, get bored because it’s probably the same thing over and over again, and then uninstall it for a newer, more promising game. 

But I’m never gonna buy anything else from hello games, I just remark that work has been put into the game but I am no longer supporting this company. But work has been done.
Feels like much much longer.  5yrs though? Really? I couldve sworn this game came out like 2012.
    You're definitely joking. The screenshot of Steam literally says it came out in 2016.
NMS also ran when it launched. Yes it was buggy as hell. And no it didn't have anywhere what was promised. But CP2077 didn't run at all on most consoles. Barely ran on PC. And nothing that was promised what in the game. 

So yeah NMS and CP2077 had HORRIBLE launches filled with lies and bullshit. But Hello Games came through. I can't say as much for CDPR. Their last "update" was trash. 

As a final thought.. if you don't like the game why are you here?
That's post launch, but NMS definitely has done a really good job post launch, much better than Cyberpunk so far.  


That's besides the point though

    Xanax would probably be better for you rather than some imaginary friend.

Multiplayer was "kind of" in game. https://massivelyop.com/2016/08/10/no-mans-sky-the-non-multiplayer-multiplayer-game/ (sadly the clip has been removed), but I'm sure you can "literally find videos" of what was happening. Finding this link took me exactly 23 seconds.

"The galaxies with real physics and orbit just like real life!" were deliberately scrapped for a much more SciFi'esk and *enjoyable* unrealistically close-knit approach. if you want to "fly" a make-belief spaceship for 45 minutes while watching netflix because that's all you can do during the flight, then by all means play E:D.

You might also want to check the meaning of psychopath, you little irrate narcist.

            You're really an idiot, aren't you? Do they let you go out of your house alone or do you have to have a chaperone?

your clip is Sean Murray speaking out of his ass indeed, but most of what he says was actually in game (the whole chemical elements you can mix together to get something else) or has been allegedly scraped for *fun*'s sake (like the realistic astronomy).  Notice how he often uses "would" instead of "will" ... that's Sean Murray saying what might one day be possible, you pathetic excuse for a microscopically-brained-primate.

Learn to read and listen .. and maybe try to wrap your head around the fact that English is not everyone's first language ... Du blödes, stupides, unglaublich borniertes mutterfickendes Arschloch. Putain de merde! T'es con comme une porte de prison?!?

who got scammed?
Pretty cool job for life!  I'm glad they're sticking at it.
Nah fam, they're literally never gonna have to worry about money ever again. All they have to do is invest even a decent chunk of that money properly, and then they can do whatever they want from there, for the rest of their lives.

If I had 70 mil / 20 people, I'd make updates for NMS forever, or as long as was practical, and do it at a leisurely pace without ruining my health or general well being as the game development sector often does. (Due to virtually non-existent employee protections.)

And yeah, that'd be a dream come true. Just being able to play your passion for the rest of your life without destroying your interest due to 'necessity'. Plus the game continues to put out because more updates = more new players.

Can you imagine? It's crazy how they completely leaned into their rather abysmal failure and turned it into a resounding success. The hilarious part is that what they promised and failed to deliver at the beginning, is now completely possible because they have all the time in the world to just work on this game in any way they please.
    if they invest in a good wallet of companies, real state, etc. 10mil they get easily enough to pay everyone there every month a good amount of money. they could use part of that money to help other small game companies make their games a reality. if the game is really good they could just add those people to their company and let them make the game as a Hello Games IP.
The funny this is I never seen this for other companies except for fromsoft where people will buy the dlcs as soon they come out. I would gladly buy their dlcs just to support them. But since we get it for free I wish they implement some way to support them more.
Absolutely. He has put together one hell of a team!
I did read their statements, did you? Its in note 8.

They made $4 million and $5 million in the past 2 years respectively due to government tax credits/grants
I don’t get people being mad at all, honestly. Disappointed? Sure, but not mad. Correct me if I’m wrong but most people who didn’t like the game upon release could get refunded their money, so what did they lose? Faith in a good game being made? Sure, but that seems like a very immature thing to be mad over. And even more, and immature thing to hold against them. 
Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Eh, anyone can feel however they want, but the game has been spectacular for a few years now, and has just been getting better, in my opinion. I also feel like anyone who’s still upset about it’s release needs to grow up. But that just my personal feelings about it all.
    > Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Not in this age. A tweet doesn’t cost 12 hours and a lot of man hours to put out.  Especially when they were developing the game and they were tweeting all over the place up until the launch. How does that make sense?

Immature to hold against them? They are a company that delivered a product that was poor. If you’re new to gaming, you must be new to the complaints  gamers have about all sorts of products. It is not immature to want the features they promised.

It would be immature and naïve to assume game developers shouldn’t communicate with their consumers. Who doesn’t do that? 

As much as I hate Todd Howard, he delivered a better game with Skyrim. And when it came out buggy, they communicated and fixed it which is why that game is legendary and no man sky will be only legendary for fixing a mistake.

Hell even this announcement is odd isn’t it? Like they are on the special because they are fixing a problem, no other reason. That’s a low bar.

Also as a gaming consumer, you don’t want to get developers in this habit of delivering piss poor products with the promise of fixing it much later.
        This was a game that got too hyped up because of communicating too much. A game that had high hopes that couldn’t be met with their resources and time. I think radio silence was the smartest move for them. 

Yes, it’s immature to hold a grudge on a small dev group that is clearly trying to make a game they love. I understand that they didn’t give what was promised but honestly? It doesn’t fucking matter. They’re trying their hardest to improve the game and it’s better now than it ever could have been at launch, and it has nothing to do with promises or talking to their fan base, but simply caring about their product. 

No Man’s Sky may be legendary to you only for fixing a mistake, but that’s not the case for everyone. They made a mediocre glitchy game to start and then built upon it. I’m sorry that you can’t move past what it was, but some of us can. 

I’ll die on the hill that living with grudges and always holding mistakes above peoples heads forever is immature, and shows a lack of growth in character. 

You can feel however you want about this game but anger is an immature emotion to feel about something so inconsequential as a video game. I’ve never felt angry when a game fails to live up to its expectations and promises because I know how hard being an artist is. No matter how grand the idea, it’s only as good as how you execute it. 

They had a bad launch but I believe wholeheartedly that every step that they’ve taken since then has been the right one. They’ve redeemed themselves, and they kept going. 

Also, I don’t think that I fully agree with your final statement. I think that a game as vast and exploration based as NMS benefits from being released as a base and then being built upon. I think if they had thought of doing it that way initially, they could’ve made the base game better, admittedly, but used that foundation to do what they’ve done, which I think is ultimately successful and a relatively reasonable model. I think it’s a very stagnant mindset to expect everything to work the same way all the time, and anything that diverts from the standard flow is unacceptable. 

They’ve done well, regardless of what you think, and deserve every bit of praise that they get. But we’re allowed to disagree, otherwise, this world would be a rather stagnant place, no?
Sure they are, no-one said they aren't allowed to be mad. But after they've more than made up for it by now, it make them look childish and immature to not be capable for moving on.
    I mean that’s what people did, they moved on. The game came out in 2016, and lots video games have been coming out that have been phenomenal since then, with better releases and without drama.

I would argue it kind of hurts the industry to not give those developers props for better releases.
        ??? one company being commended for providing free updates and fixing and expanding their game beyond the original vision doesn't mean other developers aren't getting props for their release. That doesn't make any sense. I'm getting the feeling you haven't even played the game since release to be honest.
            Beyond their original vision? No man, this is their vision realized.

And  I think you’re confusing “free” updates with “required” updates. as in hello games required these updates if they ever wanted to function as a game company ever again. 

Their reputations were on the line,  and no one is bound to play a bad game in hopes of it getting better. 

Hello game situation is unique, but in most cases developers would walk away. Someone who had a bad launch knows that players are going to leave to play other games.

Have you been stuck on this game since 2016? Think about how many awesome games you may have missed. Games that were already done at launch. 

Doesn’t seem silly to risk that for another bad launch? what if another video game has a horrible launch, do you have to play it through and wait until they improve it? I’d argue hell no you don’t.

Don’t be a fan boy, be a good consumer.
                Remember that itemized list of everything promised that was missing from launch? Yea back when the NEXT update came out, they pulled that list out and 95% of it was done...

Infact majority of the games features it has now wasn't even something they promised (some were even things they said would never be in). So yea... that does count as beyond their original vision.

Obviously i haven't only played this game since 2016, this isn't about saying launch nms was fine, it was broken af. This is about saying "awesome! They gave us what was promised and then some. What a great turn of events".

Like seriously, how hard of a concept is it for you to understand that?

What i can't understand is why someone who holds such a grudge against this game keeps coming back to the reddit. Like, you talk about missing out on other games but here you are wasting your time airing your grievance about how the game was 5 years ago 5 years later.

If that isn't the definition of pathetic, idk what is. Just "move on" already ffs
4 hours, not 2 weeks (very common for mobile games to have wait beyond that), also you cant skip the wait with Micro Transactions. I just think its so people don't grind all the content in one long marathon (which would be very not fun, this kind of content is meant to be segmented over time to be fun)
    I think the problem is that the system works well as a sort of side feature during normal gameplay, but a lot of players are at "end game." Having a timer to check up on your settlement is fine when you have the main quest and other side quests and other timers from the base building questline and are upgrading your equipment...

When you're at the point where your main objective is just going where the solar wind takes you, and the solar wind takes you to this new settlement feature and it can't just be the thing you're doing, that's when it becomes frustrating. Which is why we should be able to pump some kind of resource or units or nanites or something to speed up the process.
        They should have just made it so that it takes a lot more resources to upgrade each building. That way new players will have another thing to work towards and end game players will have something to dump their resources into. The whole waiting time thing is just AIDS.
        The problem is that parts of buildings are split up so you have to go back multiple times. It should be one interaction and then you go away for however many hours, come back and it's finished.
            Or have each part be immediately interactable with their own timers. So if you have the supplies for the frame but not the roof, you can start construction on that part while you get the other materials. If you have everything you need, you can start construction on all parts and have them all be done in an hour or whatever.
    A few complaints I have heard are mainly regarding the time gating from streamer friends, they want to stream the new content and stuff, but end up just doing older content because of the gating. Makes it a very hard update to stream and showcase content, and these guys are space billionaires so it's not like they missed any content previously.
        I dont really want game mechanics dictated by whats easier for streamers. I want the developers to think about what's best for the gameplay and the mechanics. I'm not saying whether or not they should change the time gating or not but it absolutely shouldn't be so streamers have more content and can make more money, it should be whatever makes the game more fun for the average player.
            I get what you are saying, but as a non-streamer I absolutely hate time gates
                I'm not disagreeing with that at all. I just think making design choices based on streamers preferences is not a good way to go about deciding how the mechanics of games work.

Edit: wording
            Whether anyone likes it or not, streamers are an important aspect that has to be considered from a development and community standpoint. More and more, streamers are becoming a determining factor in a long-term health and viability.
    4 hours two weeks it does not matter tbh. The problem is that you had to wait to throw almost nothing in there then you have to wait again. During the 12 hour total session it takes i could have built 100 similar landing pad. In a game if its not mobile game idling timers are just stupid and unnecessary. The game supposed to engage the player and not to make them go away and then come back for 3 minutes to perform a click just to wait another 4 hours.
Make the settlement building engaging. Force the player (By making actuall high rsc needs for buildings) to either actually grind the resources for the building or buy it. Atleast we would have some use for units after buying our dream ships and freighter.
    Better then having to wait a year to have your city completed. You should be able to speed it up atleast with batteries or some shit.
        Seriously. It's painful seeing my settlement just get farther and farther into debt faster than things can build.
            I'm not having the same experience. I'm on my 7th building and my debt is only about 175k. I did choose mostly production boosting buildings first off. So the income is healthy.

Also I went to multiple settlements and looked at stats before claiming one. My first was just a test run just to figure out mechanics. Found and claimed a new one shortly after.
                I also looked at about a dozen or so and couldn't find one better than C class.
I immediately thought "world of warcraft" lol... i know it's not but it fits the description lol
    I got into wow again a month before the whole shitshow happened and was keen to play it, then just stopped subbing. Hope blizzard sorts their shit out
        Yeah I did too. I rerolled, leveled my Alliance (the ratio is another mess) char up. Just got into the Maw for the first time and started to noticed less and less of the guild was online. I asked,, and unsubbed.
Don't forget covid struck. A lot of people may have started playing again after not for a long time do to quarantine and found the improvements.
    Oh yeah, I forgot about Covid

...is a phrase that most people probably won't say for a while...

but I actually did.
        Amnesia one of the side-effects. :-D
            Nah man, that a different game series. /s
        I keep forgetting that its been a fucking year since it started. It feels like that shit started like 4 or 5 months ago
            I feel you man it's been a long 2020
            We're approaching two years.

And I would hold onto my pants, because due to various circumstances I won't bother getting into, doesn't seem like it will be going away for a while.

Nerds truly did inherit the Earth when the COVID-19 update was released for Life.
The down tick started in the beginning of 2020, Origins released September 2020.
Couldn’t you just use the Xbox app on your Pc? 

I do that to play Forza with a friend who is on Xbox
    Oh... I never thought of that. I have everything Xbox disabled because it was Messing with rocket league a while back and I had forgotten that I had it. Great idea
        It’s not the best platform on PC but it’s much simpler for the other party, and sound quality should be better than on a tablet.
            I imagine that a headset can be pluged as on a phone, or with a usb OTG.
That's what Discord is for! 😁

> You all are so willing to except such a sub par product and put it on such a high pedestal.. its like looking at a cult.

This is exactly how I feel every time I read any of the Nintendo or Nintendo game subs. 

Really don't understand how some game developers get absolutely crucified for making even the tiniest mistake but others can get away with doing the bare minimum or less and be praised for it. 

I wouldn't say your critique of NMS is entirely fair but overall I agree with the sentiment.
    I totally agree! Nintendo bugs the hell out of me too! They absolutely get by doing the bare minimum.
Hey, calm down maybe? The fact that it terrifies you and enrages you that different people like different things than you do is borderline sociopathy. You've got a lot of growing to do to be able to accept that not everyone is going to fit your cookie cutter shape, and that's OK, because there are other shapes and they are great too in their own way.
    Hearing critiscm about a game prompts you to call the critic a sociopath? That's very healthy behavior. I never once insulted you, I just gave a very well thought out opinion. Maybe you should relaxe and re evaluate some things.
Right?! Like 'omg I just lost all my stuff in this cave and I can't get back and damnit I really needed that gun from that drop, this game sucks I'm just gonna log off.

... okay but I should breed my wolves first and oh right I gotta put fertilizer in the crops and oh wow is that a max level yuty hold on'

Evil, evil, evil game.
Yeah, but this guy wants to make shit up to justify to themselves why they are right and everyone else is wrong.
Please reread what I posted
He's just one of those deeply angry people. It's got nothing to do with HG or video games in general. As Chad Daniels says, he's one of those people that wakes up in the morning and says "How can I be a victim today?"

    Options -> General Options -> Hold to confirm

You still have to hold to begin dialogue with npcs and interact with objects etc., but every in-menu hold is replaced with clicking
Minecraft and NMS's save structures are fundamentally different.

Minecraft's save files will inevitably bloat to many Gigabytes in size after enough time and exploration, as every single generated chunk and voxel's state is stored.

NMS generates and completely deletes voxel terrain data as the player moves around, regenerating it again as needed, with only player-made edits being stored in the save.

Unlike Minecraft, NMS is also made with cloud saving in mind. So the number of terrain modifications that can be stored is limited as the save file is ideally kept as small as possible. HG could go the Minecraft route, but at the cost of losing cloud save support and the inevitable massive save bloating.

All that aside, bases are glitched and don't retain terrain edits as they are intended to. Land fills back in long before the base's terrain edit limit is even reached and/or no other edits have been made.
    [deleted]
        Absolutely, and it is indeed supposed to work like that but doesn't :(

To my knowledge, HG has made several attempts to fix it with no success
            [deleted]
                I'm hoping they can fix it too. It would open up so many exciting possibilities for base building!

Good luck out there Traveller, I hope that you can one day (soon) return in full glory with an unburied base <3
Minecraft uses servers to store your changes.  It also has a miniscule map in comparison to NMS. 

These make it _completely_ different from a technology perspective.

And yes, I get it that this destroys part of the gaming experience, it's been a constant source of complaints ever since base-building wherever you wanted has been a thing.  Originally you could only claim existing base-computers, and these where always placed on a flat piece of land.  Sounds similar to settlements, doesn't it? Cue people complaining they want to build their base anywhere. Hmm.. we've already got people asking to start their own settlements anywhere.
After no man sky, and drama on the release, I got lost into a game called Dying Light,  l’ve got about 300 hours in that game and I don’t think no man sky is ever going to come close to that playtime lol
Hey man, don’t get it misconstrued, if you go to my history you will see that I’m arguing with a NMS fanboy right now about his allegiance to a game that didn’t deliver.

I hate that this happened, I hate that an indie games was marketed as a AAA game, I hate the lies, I hate how bad their PR was when the game launched by them going radio silent for six months, and you better believe I was on all the forums talking about this game and this company.

But I already bought the game. And a PR team isn’t a development team, someone had to do the work to make a better game and in a lot of ways I’m glad that they did. 

In all honesty, I’ll download it again, play it for a few hours, get bored because it’s probably the same thing over and over again, and then uninstall it for a newer, more promising game. 

But I’m never gonna buy anything else from hello games, I just remark that work has been put into the game but I am no longer supporting this company. But work has been done.
You're definitely joking. The screenshot of Steam literally says it came out in 2016.
Xanax would probably be better for you rather than some imaginary friend.

Multiplayer was "kind of" in game. https://massivelyop.com/2016/08/10/no-mans-sky-the-non-multiplayer-multiplayer-game/ (sadly the clip has been removed), but I'm sure you can "literally find videos" of what was happening. Finding this link took me exactly 23 seconds.

"The galaxies with real physics and orbit just like real life!" were deliberately scrapped for a much more SciFi'esk and *enjoyable* unrealistically close-knit approach. if you want to "fly" a make-belief spaceship for 45 minutes while watching netflix because that's all you can do during the flight, then by all means play E:D.

You might also want to check the meaning of psychopath, you little irrate narcist.

        You're really an idiot, aren't you? Do they let you go out of your house alone or do you have to have a chaperone?

your clip is Sean Murray speaking out of his ass indeed, but most of what he says was actually in game (the whole chemical elements you can mix together to get something else) or has been allegedly scraped for *fun*'s sake (like the realistic astronomy).  Notice how he often uses "would" instead of "will" ... that's Sean Murray saying what might one day be possible, you pathetic excuse for a microscopically-brained-primate.

Learn to read and listen .. and maybe try to wrap your head around the fact that English is not everyone's first language ... Du blödes, stupides, unglaublich borniertes mutterfickendes Arschloch. Putain de merde! T'es con comme une porte de prison?!?

if they invest in a good wallet of companies, real state, etc. 10mil they get easily enough to pay everyone there every month a good amount of money. they could use part of that money to help other small game companies make their games a reality. if the game is really good they could just add those people to their company and let them make the game as a Hello Games IP.
> Didn’t they go on radio silence to focus on fixing the game? Is that not the most valid reason?

Not in this age. A tweet doesn’t cost 12 hours and a lot of man hours to put out.  Especially when they were developing the game and they were tweeting all over the place up until the launch. How does that make sense?

Immature to hold against them? They are a company that delivered a product that was poor. If you’re new to gaming, you must be new to the complaints  gamers have about all sorts of products. It is not immature to want the features they promised.

your clip is Sean Murray speaking out of his ass indeed, but most of what he says was actually in game (the whole chemical elements you can mix together to get something else) or has been allegedly scraped for *fun*'s sake (like the realistic astronomy).  Notice how he often uses "would" instead of "will" ... that's Sean Murray saying what might one day be possible, you pathetic excuse for a microscopically-brained-primate.

Learn to read and listen .. and maybe try to wrap your head around the fact that English is not everyone's first language ... Du blödes, stupides, unglaublich borniertes mutterfickendes Arschloch. Putain de merde! T'es con comme une porte de prison?!?

This was a game that got too hyped up because of communicating too much. A game that had high hopes that couldn’t be met with their resources and time. I think radio silence was the smartest move for them. 

Yes, it’s immature to hold a grudge on a small dev group that is clearly trying to make a game they love. I understand that they didn’t give what was promised but honestly? It doesn’t fucking matter. They’re trying their hardest to improve the game and it’s better now than it ever could have been at launch, and it has nothing to do with promises or talking to their fan base, but simply caring about their product. 

No Man’s Sky may be legendary to you only for fixing a mistake, but that’s not the case for everyone. They made a mediocre glitchy game to start and then built upon it. I’m sorry that you can’t move past what it was, but some of us can. 

I’ll die on the hill that living with grudges and always holding mistakes above peoples heads forever is immature, and shows a lack of growth in character. 

You can feel however you want about this game but anger is an immature emotion to feel about something so inconsequential as a video game. I’ve never felt angry when a game fails to live up to its expectations and promises because I know how hard being an artist is. No matter how grand the idea, it’s only as good as how you execute it. 

They had a bad launch but I believe wholeheartedly that every step that they’ve taken since then has been the right one. They’ve redeemed themselves, and they kept going. 

Also, I don’t think that I fully agree with your final statement. I think that a game as vast and exploration based as NMS benefits from being released as a base and then being built upon. I think if they had thought of doing it that way initially, they could’ve made the base game better, admittedly, but used that foundation to do what they’ve done, which I think is ultimately successful and a relatively reasonable model. I think it’s a very stagnant mindset to expect everything to work the same way all the time, and anything that diverts from the standard flow is unacceptable. 

They’ve done well, regardless of what you think, and deserve every bit of praise that they get. But we’re allowed to disagree, otherwise, this world would be a rather stagnant place, no?
??? one company being commended for providing free updates and fixing and expanding their game beyond the original vision doesn't mean other developers aren't getting props for their release. That doesn't make any sense. I'm getting the feeling you haven't even played the game since release to be honest.
    Beyond their original vision? No man, this is their vision realized.

And  I think you’re confusing “free” updates with “required” updates. as in hello games required these updates if they ever wanted to function as a game company ever again. 

Their reputations were on the line,  and no one is bound to play a bad game in hopes of it getting better. 

Hello game situation is unique, but in most cases developers would walk away. Someone who had a bad launch knows that players are going to leave to play other games.

Have you been stuck on this game since 2016? Think about how many awesome games you may have missed. Games that were already done at launch. 

Doesn’t seem silly to risk that for another bad launch? what if another video game has a horrible launch, do you have to play it through and wait until they improve it? I’d argue hell no you don’t.

Don’t be a fan boy, be a good consumer.
        Remember that itemized list of everything promised that was missing from launch? Yea back when the NEXT update came out, they pulled that list out and 95% of it was done...

Infact majority of the games features it has now wasn't even something they promised (some were even things they said would never be in). So yea... that does count as beyond their original vision.

Obviously i haven't only played this game since 2016, this isn't about saying launch nms was fine, it was broken af. This is about saying "awesome! They gave us what was promised and then some. What a great turn of events".

Like seriously, how hard of a concept is it for you to understand that?

What i can't understand is why someone who holds such a grudge against this game keeps coming back to the reddit. Like, you talk about missing out on other games but here you are wasting your time airing your grievance about how the game was 5 years ago 5 years later.

If that isn't the definition of pathetic, idk what is. Just "move on" already ffs
They should have just made it so that it takes a lot more resources to upgrade each building. That way new players will have another thing to work towards and end game players will have something to dump their resources into. The whole waiting time thing is just AIDS.
The problem is that parts of buildings are split up so you have to go back multiple times. It should be one interaction and then you go away for however many hours, come back and it's finished.
    Or have each part be immediately interactable with their own timers. So if you have the supplies for the frame but not the roof, you can start construction on that part while you get the other materials. If you have everything you need, you can start construction on all parts and have them all be done in an hour or whatever.
I dont really want game mechanics dictated by whats easier for streamers. I want the developers to think about what's best for the gameplay and the mechanics. I'm not saying whether or not they should change the time gating or not but it absolutely shouldn't be so streamers have more content and can make more money, it should be whatever makes the game more fun for the average player.
    I get what you are saying, but as a non-streamer I absolutely hate time gates
        I'm not disagreeing with that at all. I just think making design choices based on streamers preferences is not a good way to go about deciding how the mechanics of games work.

Edit: wording
    Whether anyone likes it or not, streamers are an important aspect that has to be considered from a development and community standpoint. More and more, streamers are becoming a determining factor in a long-term health and viability.
Seriously. It's painful seeing my settlement just get farther and farther into debt faster than things can build.
    I'm not having the same experience. I'm on my 7th building and my debt is only about 175k. I did choose mostly production boosting buildings first off. So the income is healthy.

Also I went to multiple settlements and looked at stats before claiming one. My first was just a test run just to figure out mechanics. Found and claimed a new one shortly after.
        I also looked at about a dozen or so and couldn't find one better than C class.
Yeah I did too. I rerolled, leveled my Alliance (the ratio is another mess) char up. Just got into the Maw for the first time and started to noticed less and less of the guild was online. I asked,, and unsubbed.
Amnesia one of the side-effects. :-D
    Nah man, that a different game series. /s
I keep forgetting that its been a fucking year since it started. It feels like that shit started like 4 or 5 months ago
    I feel you man it's been a long 2020
    We're approaching two years.

And I would hold onto my pants, because due to various circumstances I won't bother getting into, doesn't seem like it will be going away for a while.

Nerds truly did inherit the Earth when the COVID-19 update was released for Life.
It’s not the best platform on PC but it’s much simpler for the other party, and sound quality should be better than on a tablet.
    I imagine that a headset can be pluged as on a phone, or with a usb OTG.
Absolutely, and it is indeed supposed to work like that but doesn't :(

To my knowledge, HG has made several attempts to fix it with no success

        I'm hoping they can fix it too. It would open up so many exciting possibilities for base building!

Good luck out there Traveller, I hope that you can one day (soon) return in full glory with an unburied base <3
