[[[PSA] Steam is offering No Man's Sky refunds regardless of playtime.]]


You can apply for the refund as you usually do. Hopefully, I saved a lot of people some money that would be better used. Reapply if need be, select reason as **bad performance** or **false advertising**. 

Open a ticket if you are denied by the automated system.


Edit - And as expected, downvotes. People are absolutely delusional or in denial here. 

Edit 2 - A lot of people have got refunds from this post. Reapply if you were denied before. Somebody got a refund after 72 hours!! Another user, allegedly, got a refund on Steam after 88 hours.

Edit 3 - For anyone wondering, this post was at 0 for an hour after posting and was removed by a mod initially. They brought it back due to the post having some discussion.

Edit 4 - [Some alleged proof from owner numbers decreasing ](http://steamspy.com/app/275850). People are getting refunds, so reapply or open support tickets. Note - These numbers might just be a random fluctuation.

Edit 5 - For those who brought it on GOG, there is a 30 day money back guarantee. They make exceptions even if it's more than 30 days, so contact their support and they will respond. 

For people who used Humble Bundle, their support is useful and might give you a refund.

Users on the thread have reported they have got refunds for PS4, as a one time courtesy, by contacting support.

Edit 6 - [Thread about PS4 users getting successful refunds.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/4z3eyx/how_to_refund_no_mans_sky_digital_copy_for_ps4/). Props to /u/VALAR_M0RGHUL1S. (~~Some users have suggested that you might be unable to rebuy the digital edition after you refund. I can't test this, unfortunately~~), quote from VALAR who contacted support 

> Hey saw what you added about not being able to repurchase the game on PS4. I actually addressed this in my post:
I had read this article saying that Sony will block you from ever repurchasing a game that was refunded to you, but I asked the agent I spoke with about this and he assured me I could purchase the game again if I ever wanted to. I can still see the game in my library but it has a locked padlock icon on it now. When I select the game it tells me I have to repurchase it to play it again and then has a button linking to the PSN store to buy the game. So definitely not true that you can't buy the game again after it's been refunded.
Not 100% sure since obviously I havent tested completing the transaction, but according to the agent I spoke to I will be able to buy the game again at any point. I also have the option to add the game to my basket on PSN and presumably complete that transaction. Doesn't look like I'm locked out of buying it at all. Just wanted to let you know about that!


Edit 7 - Users have reported being able to get refunds from Amazon if you got a physical copy. Use their chat support and explain the situation.

Edit 8 - For those having issues with automated response, **Open a Support ticket [HERE](https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php)**.

Edit 9 - I have been getting a lot of hate send to me via PM, keep em coming and stay classy :).

Edit 10 - Wow! After all the hate, thank you /u/Alec17king for the gold and /u/Dureeoh for the kind message.

Edit 11 - /u/kashmoney360
> PSA: PC owners, if you've played with the experimental branch, Steam only keeps a tab on the normal branch. I played only 1 hr on the normal branch and 8 on the experimental. My refund ticket displayed only the normal branch playtime.

Some users have reported that this is different for them, so YMMV.

Edit 12 - Thank you kind stranger for the second gold.

Edit 13/Final edit - **Some users on Steam have been reporting that refunds happen faster/easier if you refund directly to Steam wallet, rather than PayPal or CC**. Good luck everyone, going to bed now :).

Edit 14 - Steam has put up a notice that they have stopped making an exception for NMS, good luck to all those who placed their requests. I imagine the demand was unprecedented.

Edit 15 - Some users have reported still being able to get refunds through, so YMMV. Other users have reported that they are still able to get refunds on PS4 and Amazon with no issues.

Edit 16 - PSN continues to give refunds. One of the users saved this [image](http://imgur.com/a/RctTd), CS already knows what game the refund is for.

Edit 17 - I[ have been officially banned from the subreddit](http://i.imgur.com/T4hCR91.jpg). Hope everything works out for everyone.

Edit 18 - So even though I am banned, I can still edit this post. I have gotten a lot of messages in the past 12 hours with people still getting Steam refunds. Keep trying :).

Edit 19 - /u/noblackthunder has started a [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/2HsxWHb) for people trying to get refunds through Steam.

Edit 20 - I got a message from /u/Hodori88 regarding illegality of HG games marketing practices

> Hey Mate,
Just wanted to say good on ya for making that No Man's Sky thread and all the accompanying hate.
I created a thread about how Sony has breached Australian Consumer Laws and was inundated with idiots.
Unfortunately, Sony has declined my refund, but I feel maybe the information i found out and posted about may help other fellow australian users in getting the refund they're owed by law.
I have been speaking with the ACCC, Consumer Affairs Victoria, and VCAT. Their advice to me has been the following:
In regards to No Man's Sky - Sony has breached s33 and s56 of the Australian Consumer Law (Misleading conduct as to the nature of goods, and Guarantee relating to the supply of goods by description respectively).
Additionally, their refund policy is unfair and potentially illegal in the sense that you can't tell if the product matches the description, or if it's faulty, or if any other consumer guarantees have been breached until you have downloaded the product, which then excludes sony from providing you with any refund, which you are legally entitled to if a consumer guarantee was breached (as has been in this case with No Man's Sky).
The extent of transparency in Sony's refund policy is unclear in determining whether it is fair to limit liability via acquiescence of purchase.
Sony has continued to refuse to acknowledge my legal rights and arguments, and as such is subject to a class action law suit. (I even provided them screenshots of where it says network play on the game description page on the store, nullifying their argument that it says single player on the store page and therefore no refund. The fact it says network play on the game page on the store means it would be understandable for any reasonable person to presume a single player game with online connectivity aspects as promised in the lead up to the game).
If anyone else feels Sony has breached the law, please PM me!
>s33: 33 Misleading conduct as to the nature etc. of goods
               A person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is liable to mislead the public as to the nature, the manufacturing process, the characteristics, the suitability for their purpose or the quantity of any goods.
>Note: A pecuniary penalty may be imposed for a contravention of this section.
s56: 56 Guarantee relating to the supply of goods by description
         (1)  If:
             (a)  a person supplies, in trade or commerce, goods by description to a consumer; and

             (b)  the supply does not occur by way of sale by auction;
there is a guarantee that the goods correspond with the description.
         (2)  A supply of goods is not prevented from being a supply by description only because, having been exposed for sale or hire, they are selected by the consumer.
     (3)  If goods are supplied by description as well as by reference to a sample or demonstration model, the guarantees in this section and in section 57 both apply.
>Consumer guarantees: Since 1 January 2011, the following consumer guarantees on products and services apply.
Products must be of acceptable quality, that is:
safe, lasting, with no faults look acceptable do all the things someone would normally expect them to do. Acceptable quality takes into account what would normally be expected for the type of product and cost.
Products must also:
match descriptions made by the salesperson, on packaging and labels, and in promotions or advertising match any demonstration model or sample you asked for be fit for the purpose the business told you it would be fit for and for any purpose that you made known to the business before purchasing come with full title and ownership not carry any hidden debts or extra charges come with undisturbed possession, so no one has a right to take the goods away or prevent you from using them meet any extra promises made about performance, condition and quality, such as life time guarantees and money back offers have spare parts and repair facilities available for a reasonable time after purchase unless you were told otherwise.

    No, Sean Murray's nest egg.
    If this was the case, I would seriously give it a shot. I would fix that damn warpdrive that breaks whenever I jump a black hole and go get that refund. 
    This should be a lesson for all devs in the future to not exaggerate it with lies.
"You have learned the Korvax word for refund"
    I think I actually have that word.
Wow theres so many of you refunding! 
    Amazing! Wow..
        [deleted]
            It's a testament to how amazing our support team is that refunds are even working at all.

Edit: Thanks to the anonymous redditor for my first gold :)
    These refunds wouldn't even be possible if it wasn't for our development team!

*Amazing*
    It's blowing my mind! Wow!
Watching the aftermath of this game has been more entertaining than the game itself. 
    Wonder what that dude who paid $1,500 for a leaked copy is thinking right now. 
        "Someone just mentioned me on the internet still, so it was worth it."

Nah, he's probably just sad. If he has that much money to blow though it probably didn't hurt him too badly. One of those people that has more money than sense. 
        He has said over and over again on the stream he did (in which he donated 400 bucks to autism charity btw) that he doesn't regret the purchase in any way. Getting games early like that is a hobby for him and 1200 bucks isn't as big of a financial dent for some people. He was actually a really cool guy on the stream and I don't understand the hate that went out towards him other than pure jealousy.
            I had no problem with him until he said the game was a 9 out of 10. That was straight up misleading at a time when no one else had reviewed it.
            Not everyone understands other's hobbies. For example,  people get pissed if you buy a console/mac/Alianware, as they see it as wasting money. They're not jealous, they're just unable to understand why someone would ever do it. 
        What I don't understand is that he didn't warn people how shit of a game it was. 
            Post-purchase rationalisation perhaps? He did do a massive speech on (arr!)/gaming about why he bought it, people praised him and anyone who criticized him got shut down. But I guess thats what happens when hype gets out of control, it was almost cult-like.
            he did.

daymeeuhn was probably the only reasonable person in the NMS community, and yet he still got shit on by fanbois just for giving his honest opinion of the game. He said the universe was bland and it didn't get crazier as he reached the center of the galaxy, etc. Everyone just kept shouting at him, saying he had a preview copy of the game, and that release would change everything, etc.

He was calm in his responses and he gave pretty much the same review that everyone else did. He talked about how much the game crashed, and some of the other bugs he encountered. He said that the game should have been beta tested. Etc.

Basically, everything that the community needed to know about NMS was covered by his posts, several days before official release. Instead of listening to him, and putting the breaks on the hype-train, the community just yelled at him for posting 'spoilers' and they went full-steam-ahead into this disaster. 

It's kinda funny looking back at it now. Everyone was so afraid of spoilers, but there really wasn't anything to spoil. 
        If they can afford that I doubt they care
            They will care when they make more terrible purchases like that and then wonder where the fuck their money went.
    Bruh. The real world around the game has features the game was supposed to have. More Real factions(pro-sean, anti-sean, modders, and those fucking portal lunatics), massive scale battles(any forum), a wildly varied economy(worlds largest launch! Lol 80% of players in 2 weeks and now refunds), and the modders are making discoveries left and right that nobody has seen before.

    Im wondering, even if it was potentially false news, why would one remove such a post. I mean the point system is already something that determines how "good" a post is right, so if something is "remove-worthy", it'll not get high anyway.
        Bored mods.

As someone who has been a moderator of a lot of things, and as someone who runs several subreddits, I find the mentality of a lot of moderators to be extremely frustrating, which is why I pick them very. very carefully.

'I removed it because the karma was low'

'You did what?  So what if the karma is low, karma is a system designed to make things less visible or more visible depending on its votes, it doesn't need help'

'I locked the thread because it got 'out of control'

'Unless people are posting dox, or being especially hateful, having passionate discussions is not 'out of control''



I've had to remove mods, who even after several warnings, did not seem to 'get it'

sometimes there's nothing to moderate. Sometimes (most of the time) you dont need to make any rules. (but certainly make some rules)


**Bored mods destroy empires**
            Oh man, you'd have a field day with the mods on the Steam forums.

            Looking at you r/politics. 
                Mod removes article with 4000 upvotes: 'Title not exact match'

Turns out it was a missing period


                    Don't like that rule. What if the title of the article is misleading, inflammatory, or clickbaity? 
                Also r/news
                I think /r/politics is just pretending to be like /r/totallynotrobots 
                    /r/politics caught the infection /r/politicaldiscussion got from /r/hillaryclinton, which was a lab brewed money virus that attacks facts related to Hillary Clinton while upvoting inflammitory antiTrump stuff. Did you know Trump is a jack ass? Go to /r/politics for all the latest specifics on that if you haven't gotten the jist by now.

Just don't mention Clinton in a negative way.
            that's what happens when you give some power to frustrated internet kids
                I shudder to think how many mods of subs with 40,000+ subscribers are children. 
                    To give you a little insight on that, whenever a video game gets announced, a sub is created within minutes for that game.

Anyone, and everyone can become a mod, it's just whoever the fuck gets there first.
            /r/nfl is removing all posts about Colin Kaepernick protesting during the national anthem
            Subreddits such as this one are also more recently prone to clickbait posts because you can get karma from self posts now
        One of the mods recently explained an easily exploitable feature on this subreddit: If a post is reported by 7 different users, it's automatically removed.

EDIT: To be fair, they apparently receive a message when this happens, and they're given the ability to restore it.
            7 seems low for a sub with this many people 
                Subs get spammed a lot by bots. Most spam filters catch this, but sometimes you don't really want 20 people to have to see something before it gets flagged. It doesn't delete the post, it's just removes it until a live-mod can look at it. As this subreddit only has 12 mods and over 160k subs (with many MANY angry subs), it seems more than reasonable to allow the bot to flag and remove as quickly as possible, as it's better to have 1 mistaken good post than 10 shit spam posts. 
            This actually explains a great deal.
        Its not false news. just got my refund. purchased on launch day and put 10 hours in before i decided it really wasnt gonna get better.
            Not so much. 14 hours in 2 days. No refund.  
        > I mean the point system is already something that determines how "good" a post is right, so if something is "remove-worthy", it'll not get high anyway.

Truthometer: False.
            Hah!  Indeed.  The point system means that the majority of the most opinionated people who read it agree strongly with it or disagree strongly with the opposite of what it seems to be saying.
            Just once I would love to visit a sub with pop-up text over the downvote arrow that says "This is a disagree button."
    [removed]
        A strong subreddit lets the voting system handle the posts.

Just look at any "new" section of the major subs. Complete garbage. And the community handles it fine with the voting system. Mods don't need to delete harmless posts. Unless it's literally calling for the death of someone, doxxing them, or doing something else obviously horrible, it should always stay. Mods deleting stuff because they don't like it is mods admitting this isn't a community, this is their sandbox and they allow nothing they disagree with here. Which is fine except we'll all leave and the community here will die if they behave like children by doing that nonsense.

A good example of a subreddit that allowed all the crap posts, and thrived because of it, is /r/PokemonGO. And you still had /r/TheSilphRoad if you wanted a more serious version. They basically allowed all the nonsense and rode the wave of shitposts and memes, because that's 50% of what their community was. That's a very nice way of handling things.
            It depends on the sub, honestly. r/TheSilphRoad had to crack down on shitposts to make it what it is today - when it was initially just r/PokemonGo with a bit of a superiority complex. It's not removing posts because "I don't like it", but because the posts don't belong in the subreddit based on the rules and spirit of the sub.

Of course, whenever the rules aren't explicitly black and white, disagreements will arise. It's on the mods to enforce gray-area rules from the perspective of the spirit of the subreddit, which is hard sometimes. For example, r/baseball is obviously a subreddit for fans of baseball, but we've had to add a rule restricting posts about player performances because people were beginning to post about entirely uneventful things. When deciding whether those posts should stay or go, I have to look beyond my own biases and fandom and determine whether the event is noteworthy in the eyes of the community. And sometimes I'm sure I'll get it wrong - I might remove something that would've been fairly well received, and I might leave a post that gets downvoted and ignored. But if the mods approach it from the perspective of the subreddit instead of themselves, it would work considerably better.
                /r/baseball mod! My fav sub. Go Cubs Go!
            > And the community handles it fine with the voting system.

Or a handful of people can literally take over a sub simply by hovering the new section. See: r/leagueoflegends/ for a while.

++
                This.  A small group, working together can pretty manipulate things on the front page on a lot of forums.  And even on the larger groups with a sympathetic (knowingly or unknowingly) mod, the same can happen.  By the very nature of the voting system and how the individual forum front pages work.
            The overwhelmingly most common incentive anyone seems to want to be a mod on Reddit is to inject themselves as a middle man between users and the voting system. Otherwise it's just volunteer service. The sort of people who rightfully see it as such and do it anyway as a good will to a community need more pats on the back. 
                Kind of like politicians.  The ones who want the job are the ones that shouldn't have the job.  
                I became a mod to be a CSS bitch and ride the hype of giving people flairs and designing a pretty subreddit. Now I'm a CSS bitch majorly ignored by the community
                    Which kind of means you're doing your job well.  When the community notices you too much, as a mod, it's generally a bad thing.  Now your work on the other hand, hopefully they appreciate that, even if folks generally are quieter when satisfied than they are when the opposite is true.
                        When people wanted cat flairs I got daily messages for like a month. I finally broke after a mod mail, got off my ass, and made a ton of silly ones. You can see the result on the subreddit.
            >A strong subreddit lets the voting system handle the posts.

Not true.  Otherwise you end up with /r/gaming shitposts all the time.

Over on /r/XboxOne and /r/ps4, we have rules to keep content relatively high quality.  No memes, reaction gifs, or shit in general.

That said, I'd never remove a post if it didn't break any rules simply because it had low karma.
    >Mods removing relevant threads and realizing their mistake

Amazing

On the first day?

Just amazing.
    My issue is they aren't leaving a removal reasons for any of the posts that make the front page. Making it super irritating when something popular just disappears without a record of its existence.
    Why on earth did they have to have a discussion about it?!

There is exactly literally zero legitimate reason for this to be removed, unless cheese pizza was edited out of it.
    I posted a similar thread and was reduced to 0 upvotes and then removed as I was bringing awareness and process on how to get refunds. I'll post my bit over from r/gaming here;

Oh boy here we go; if you're after a refund try this to improve your chances:

* Open an actual ticket to try and get into contact with a REAL user, not an automated system.

* Mention about how the game was advertised and draw comparisons to the final product, make comparisons on the trailer & screenshots compared to in-game.

* Cite sources, cite interviews with Sean, youtube and article links.

* Make sure you give the game a negative review on STEAM, be constructive in this review as it will be compared against your case.

* Give specifics on your rig, specifics on crashing, frequency and performance issues.

* Be sure to emphasize how long you've been with STEAM and how you use their service and how you will seriously consider purchases with them in future if the refund isn't resolved (do this with PSN too)

* Be patient and sincere with your request, any profanity or outrage will automatically get your request ditched

* I imagine 10-15 hours of playtime is probably their threshold, if you've played 20+ I wouldn't bother.

Tacking onto this BE FIRM AS A CONSUMER. Put your foot down but don't be aggressive, remind them that you spent money on a product and you were misled. Remind them that you use/used their service for X amount of years, metaphorically remind them that their service depends on you spending money and feelng satisfied.
        I've worked in customer service all my life. If we offered returns on a product and you meet the requirement (in this case, owning the game and wanting a refund) then you got the refund. I'm sure you can just...ask for a refund through Steam. You don't need citations or specifics. You don't need to reiterate how good of a customer you are. I didn't care why your purchase didn't work out, and I'm sure Valve doesn't give a heck why you don't like No Man's Sky.
            Then you haven't had to deal with STEAM customer service, there's a very real difference that can be felt between physical item customer service and digital.

STEAM operate on a "work where you want" policy, and the majority of STEAM employees refuse to work customer service. It's their most undermanned department and Valve are ok with that. They will make you work for your money.
                Except this is a special case. As with Batman before it, they are extending their return policy to anyone that had the game regardless of playtime. There is no caveat, no asterisk. If you own it and want a refund you can have one. It's far different when dealing with normal Steam returns where, in order to even apply for a refund you have to have less than two hours of playtime and even then it's hardly guaranteed.
                    It's not an automatic thing. I have asked for a refund three times now and still getting denied. I'll keep doing it until I get it, and I thank /u/TheMuteness for his advice
    Imagine what a fucking loser that mod must be to attempt to defend this product from other consumers by obfuscating information as to their return rights.
Just to add to this, if you open a support chat with the Sony PSN support people they will offer you a refund as well to your PSN wallet as a 1 time exception dealy.
    they wouldnt let me as they said I put too much time into the game :(
        Maybe try again? I chatted with support and was initially denied, but I tried again and the second time they gave it to me. 
            I suppose it's the person you talk to that ultimately decides.
                It makes sense that they have no protocol for this, I don't blame them.
        That sucks :( how much time do you have? I put about 8 hours in and they let me.
    Just done this, hopefully will hear back soon.
    Yeah it's always worth a try with PlayStation. They've let me refund quite a lot of games. 
    And Amazon just refunded my digital download, looks like they're getting a lot of complains, they didn't even argue... Hope more people do that and that the gaming companies learn a lesson (one can hope...)
I tried for a refund, but I couldnt get one because of my playtime. Are you sure its guaraneed?
    Request refund in the normal way, you'll most likely get refused (automated reply). Then open a ticket, you'll get it when they reply.
        Stupid question, but how do you go about opening a ticket? When I go to steam support on the web, it only offers hello game's website as a solution for support. :(
            https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php
                It still makes me click a bunch of stuff and leads me to the normal refund page where I request an automated one and get rejected... how do you actually get in touch with anybody at steam?
                    Here is what I did.

Step 1 

What type of problem are you having?

: Purchases and Payments (dropdown 1)
 
: Refunds (dropdown 2)

Step 2

Is the problem with Steam or with a game on Steam?

: Game or software on Steam (button)

: No Man's Sky (game name textfield)

Step 3

This is where you submit your ticket. 
                        thanks man I'll try it out!! 
                        What should the question and text be? I'm not sure
                        I still get refused. I'll try again, both ways
                Thanks!
        Weird. I refunded after 8 hours of gameplay and it got approved after about an hour
        Opened a ticket, refund was denied. :(
        What do you mean by "Open a ticket"?

        Funny cuz true!
        Wow so many people getting refunds! My mind is blown!

        I'm so sick of these refunders looking for refunds for all the wrong reasons.  Like they're looking for refunds like they're getting a refund for Call of Duty, or Doom, or some other mindless action blows shit up shoving beer and pretzels up your bros broholes game.  

I refunded for the art, for the journey, for the adventure.  I refunded No Man's Space for the Mind Blowing vistas of the refund request screen, the endless void of the refund request process, and the final, intense, deeply fulfilling, enrapturing pinnacle of my exploration, my final jump, to the center of the refund galaxy, when I finally am told that I am not eligible for a refund, at which point I have to go beyond the confines of the automated ticket process, into a new universe, the customer support ticket system, and where my journey begins anew!  

But hey, at least in this game, once I get to the end of the automated ticket system, there is something new and improved, the customer service ticket system, to serve as new game plus.  So Gabe Newell 1, Sean Murray 0
            I so badly want to create screenshot threads of the refund process and talk about how gorgeous they are. But I'd be downvoted, banned, and probably have a nasty Vice article written about me. 
    Been denied seven times by the automated system. Sent a ticket in and haven't received a response, its been only a day though. Really hoping I get the refund. A friend had 9 more hours than I did and yet he got his on his first try -_-
    When did you try? Today?
oh damn, when steam is refunding *regardless of playtime* you done fucked up as a developer.
    Honestly, him and his euro hipster team just spelled disaster from the get go. I expected crap from that demographic like I usually do and every time I'm not surprised.
    Well, you know it is not. It is doing the same as it would for any game.
Just why the hell did I have to buy it on greenmangaming. They don't do refunds. At all.
    I feel you. I bought the fucking CE. Which still hasn't arrived...
        Being lost in the post is a very legitimate reason for a refund.
    You got your discount!
    GMG sucks.  Worst customer service ever
It looks like a lot of people are refunding.  [Owners # are going down.](http://steamspy.com/app/275850)
    Hooooly shit, look at the [dropoff in peak daily concurrent players!](http://imgur.com/a/CbcMa)

From 212,604 at launch to 15,729 just 15 days later. That's an **over 90%** drop in players. 
        I've often felt like stats related to NMS have been overblown, but that visual perspective is just staggering. If you wouldn't have told me, I would have thought each bar represented a *week* for a run-of-the-mill letdown game.
            Keep in mind that that also includes all new players as the game keeps going.

The vast majority of players are playing NMS for a day or two and then saying "Fuck this shit" and never touching it again.


        Wow, so many of you are abandoning the game!
            My mind is blown!
            If even just 1% of you keep playing, that's still so many people!
                I'm sad the about 99.99% of ~~planets~~ copies will never be discovered
    Is this really out of the ordinary though? Here's two other games that show a similar pattern. [Link 1](http://steamspy.com/app/359320) and [link 2](http://steamspy.com/app/292030)

Daily concurrent players is definitely telling, though.
        This also happens all the time when games release DLC. It happened with Titanfall, which was a fantastic game. Hopefully with 2 they won't make the same mistake.
To those having issues try this (I got refunded @6 hours played):

* Click NMS in Steam ---> Then support on the right

* Click that you're having issues with the game, and request refund.

* When it asks for a reason put "Multiplayer" and then in the comments put: "Producer promised multiplayer - No Multiplayer"

* Request funds to your Steam wallet (not sure if debit card refunds work)

At least this is how I did it. Refunded with 6 hours play time after originally being denied twice during launch week.
    In my refund request I mentioned the misleading trailer that shows features that aren't in the game at all.

Multiplayer removal is bad, but I could see them claiming it's not worth a refund because it's technically not mentioned in any of the "official" promotional material. But the trailer on the Steam page is brazen, totally inexcusable false advertising. I honestly think Valve should take it down; Hello Games is actively and deliberately lying to potential customers with that trailer.
        You're preaching to the choir here. I am in no way associated with HG. I am just trying to make sure everyone gets their dollars worth.
    Thanks, that helped a lot! Already tried to refund the game yesterday but got rejected. Today I then opened a support ticket but got again rejected

Then I did it like you and it worked!
I'm not going to take sides as to whether or not you should refund the game. If you felt you didn't get what's promised, and that makes you upset enough to refund it, that is your prerogative. If you feel the game is still worth the money and want to keep it, that is again up to you. Neither choice is wrong, neither group should be ashamed of themselves or think they're better than the other.

But there is no reason to downvote this post. It is sharing information that can be helpful to members of this community. I know this is asking a lot of Reddit, but let's be reasonable and mature here.
    Don't get me wrong it's very impressive for an indie game, and I was in awe for a bit. Then my awe just... faded away.
        I'm with you. I refunded it, myself. If they had been more honest with the community, or if they had charged a price not on par with a AAA game, I would be less inclined to return it. As it stands, I will be glad to have my money back, and I won't really miss the gameplay. It became a grind for me about 5-10 game hours ago. 
            You know what the worst part is? There have been SEVEN patches on the PS4 and every single patch just says 'bug fixes'.

They COULD put patch notes, details, whatever they want in there. They choose to just say bug fixes.

If I could return a PS4 game I would definitely return this game.
                The lack of communication and transparency is the most damning thing for me. It's seriously not that hard. 
                    it's not even lack of communication anymore.

it's pure ignorance - because there is no communication at all.
                Are we 100% sure Hello Games and Niantic are not the same company?
                    r
                    Lol! No mans sky and Pokemon go are the only 2 games I've ever refunded in my lifetime.
    I'll buy it again when it's $20
    I am in the "Keeping the game camp". I didnt have the launch issues on PC a lot of people had. The game looks and runs great on my machine. I am enjoying the game. Did Hello Games flub a PC port on a game orignally concieved to be PC only? Yes. Was Hello Game's and Sony's marketing ploys shady as fuck? Fuck yes. Was the game misrepresented in the advertising? Yes. Are all these good reasons for people to get a refund...uh yeah. So even if I didnt have almost 100 hours in the game I still wouldnt return it because I really am enjoying it. Does that mean OP should get my down vote? Nope. Upvote for you fom me. Because even though I am enjoying the game I still feel lied to. No giant fleets of ships going at it as shown in "Actual game play footage" No giant dinosaurs/sandworms. No large buildings/crashed ships to explore. It just goes on and on. The sudden backlash of funds being drained from the once filled coffers of HG and Sony will hopefully send a message that the industry will learn from...but probably not.

    Fuck that dude, you gotta pick a side!!! That's what this sub is all about!!!!!!!!!!!
    I didn't like the game and was going to just chalk it up to another example of not pre-ordering.... Then I found out what was in the center. That's the straw that broke the camels back for me. 
    I got my 20hrs of fun out of it.  No need for a refund from me.
    [deleted]
This didn’t age well.
    Au Contraire, this aged like a fine WINE

A true testament to Hello Games' competence as a game developer, even after the game was refunded who knows how many times, they still kept up and eventually gave us the game we have today

I personally dont play NMS (was just lurkin the sub like i usually do to other subs) but even i can see how much it improved after the absolute MESS that was the release.
This aged AWESOME.
    ???

the game is fun now
        Yes, this is why. They developed the game so much that the old comments are fun to read.
Nothing you can do about the ps4 version?
    There definitely is! Check out this thread:

https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/4z3eyx/how_to_refund_no_mans_sky_digital_copy_for_ps4/
        Yep. I contacted Sony just now and got my 60 bucks back to the wallet. Time to buy a game that is actually worth the money.
            Battlefield 1
                PREORDER!!!!1!!
                    What could go wrong?
                        Nothing, I prefer ordered a lot of games that were fine. No man's sky, total war Rome 2 and-

Don't preorder
                            I was so mad at the start of this comment.
            I'd rather have paid $60 for a fucking coin flip sim, at least then its gonna do what it claims to
    They were willing to refund (to your account wallet) since launch. One time deal.  

Of course, with a lot of potatoes now wanting a refund dozens of hours into the game, things probably got murkier. 
        I got a physical copy... i tryed Craigslist, but there are literally 15 other people in my area selling it for $45.
            Use it as a drink coaster.

    I got the same response man :(
        Exact same response here. I think Valve just gave them a blanket response for everything so they can keep their fat stacks.
    Exactly same response, word for word.
    Same for me. :(

Thank you, this piece of shit game doesn't deserve my money.
    What about now?
Yeah well Steam have updated the NMS page with a specific message about refunds.

So unfortunately I'm stuck with this cunt of a game in my list.

Fuck you hello games and fuck Sean Murray.
Opened a support ticket over the weekend, and got the same blanket denial response many other Steam users are getting. I gave Chuck, or whoever, a piece of my mind, though.

http://imgur.com/a/y2Ih9

My response, quoted:

>Hi Chuck,

>Thanks for the reply. I have reviewed your refund policy again, but it appears that this Steam refund policy has not been meted out evenly for players requesting a refund. To my understanding, there has been numerous instances of players requesting No Man's Sky refunds with playtimes greater than two hours, and receiving a refund. 

>I'd like to think that it's the community that is confused about Steam refunds, but it appears to me that certain players are getting refunds on this title who clearly do not meet the criteria to get a refund. Why is it that some players are getting refunds with play-times greater than two hours, yet some players are not? Am I an exception to this rule? Or were the players that got the refund the exception? It seems to me that Steam is backpedaling on their refund policy for this title after realizing the sheer amount of refund requests for this game. 

>I believe it was Gabe Newell who said, paraphrasing, "don't ever lie to the internet. They'll remember it." Why is Steam being inconsistent about this? What's exactly the truth about the refund policy? If Steam's going to dig in on this "refund policy", so be it, but I'll remember. And so will the internet.

>You're just doing your job, Chuck, or whoever happens to read this. I get it. But I hope Steam reviews their refund policies and is consistent in the future when it comes to a big release AAA title that turns out to have severe performance issues/misleading marketing.

Worked on PS4 as well. Glad I can buy a fully functioning game now.
    Glad to hear it. Tons of good games coming up.
    Could you tell me how and who you contacted? I'm on PS4 as well and would like to give it a shot to get a refund.
        Check out this thread for how to do it on PS4:

https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/4z3eyx/how_to_refund_no_mans_sky_digital_copy_for_ps4/
i was refused stating they never give refunds past 2 hours mark so dont know what kind of refund you got
    That part is automated but you can open a support ticket.
        My refund request got accepted, note the play time.... http://imgur.com/a/1RBdp

            R 599, thats a lot of R's

        How would one do that?
            https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php
        Can you explain how you went about it?  
    I didn't even buy the game and I want a refund.
        I considered buying the game and I want a refund for 10 mins that took.
            I bought a copy of the local newspaper cause there was an article about the game and the first impressions of the article writer in there, and I want to get the cost of the newspaper refunded.
        Someone bought me the game and I want THEM to get a refund.
    [This thread shows that you can get a Steam refund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4zslu6/psa_steam_is_refunding_no_mans_sky_even_if_you/)  

 I am not sure if some are getting denied (the tickets, of course automatic requests will get denied), but **you have a ton of people getting refunds past the time limits.**
        I got denied both by the automated system AND when I opened a support ticket. Both denials were based on time played.
            Use the words false advertising
            You have to keep opening tickets, sort of pestering them. A few people it took 10+ times to finally get a refund, some took just a couple times, and some on the first try. Just keep trying and you will get it. 
                In my headcanon there is literally one rogue support guy that had too high expectations and refunds everybody :D
    If you get denied, open a ticket and keep asking. One guy it took him 10 times, then he got his refund. 
Why is OP banned from Subreddit?
Man, I forgot how big angy people were when this game released.
Damn. I was bummed to find this. I knew the game blew chunks on launch (the new norm) but I’m so glad it has done a 180 since this post!
What 5 years of dedication and tlc does to a game
6 years later I wonder if anyone regrets refunding
I can confirm that I just asked for a refund with about 9 hours in the game (purchased on release day) and it was refunded within about an hour of my request.  I used the automated system.

EDIT: This refund was through Steam on PC.
    Glad you got it to work :).
Is it normal that the Steam customer support hasn't replied to your question in almost a day?
    Yeah, i have heard that they are really slow
OP, I know you probably won’t reply to this since it’s so old, but this isn’t archived for some reason so I’ll ask anyway. Did you ever give NMS another chance after the updates?
You want a refund? That's your choice.  No one should tell anyone else what to do with their consumer rights. They're OUR rights for a reason. 

People here need to realize if someone wants a refund that's their right and privellage. No company is guaranteed your money. If Hello Games didn't want to deal with even the possibility of refunds then they shouldn't have dealt with Steam, GOG, Humble Bundle, etc as refunds are part of their service. So I'm sorry but absolutely no sympathy. 

It is shocking to me how quick people are willing too throw away their rights as consumers because they have some time invested in building up a product in their mind they dont even have a stake in. 

You love the game?  Good!  Thats fine. No one is taking that away from you refunding the game. Its not gonna dissapear off your HD because some else got a refund. And if HG goes under, well guess what there's a reason for that. They have to deal with that. Not you. Period. They aren't your friend, and you owe them nothing. No matter how much you like their product. Don't believe me?  Reach out to Sean on Twitter and see how quick your friend gets back to you. Better yet try to call them. Shoot them and email. 

Point is, friends don't take your money then when you find out you've been misled ignore any and all questions about it and instead wax poetic about how "amazing" something is they previously alluded to having been nearly "zero chance"

So please quit trying to shame, attack, or discredit people trying to exercise their rights. If you don't like it, fine. But don't attempt to take away others rights because your feels are hurt. That's just a horrible precident for all of us. And some don't appreciate you trying to march us into that so willingly. 
"Oh wow look at all those refunds! My mind is blown!"
Im so happy, that i kept my hope
Well this will kill NMS and HG
    They are already dead
        Numbers out there say they sold something like 700k copies. x 60 is 42mil. Steam get a cut, Sony get a cut, but still, even if it's half of the half of that number, it's almost 10mil. I wish i was dead like that.
            [deleted]
        Well im sure they are still happy with the amount of £/$ they have got off people but in terms of future, i dont think anyone is ever gonna trust a word S.M or HG says 
            How many times did Molyneux do it to us? People have short memories.
                He already had an established reputation though, this was these guys' first time being on this scale.
                    It should also be mentioned that Fable was still a good game, however not what we expected.
                Molyneux's games weren't actually mediocre like NMS though. Now I just said like an apologist. Murray outright lied whilst Molyneux doesn't understand what a limitation is.

So glad I brought it off GOG for that 30 day guarantee  
    > GOG

Isn't it a 'guarantee' for technical troubles only, though? Is it a 'no questions asked' refund? Did you get it?
        Well, in this situation, you could easily say it is technical troubles.
There's a post on the store page now that says...

"The standard Steam refund policy applies to No Man's Sky. There are no special exemptions available"
    I sent in a ticket nearly 20hrs ago and it still hasn't been looked at yet. If people ahead of me got refunds with 20+ hours game time and I don't at only 6hrs because mine wasn't seen in time I'll be annoyed.
Man, who hurt this person? Lmao it's a game chill.... Howuch was it when it came out because I think I only paid like $25 CAD on sale if that....? I forget. I didn't think it was a bad game even on release, I was just wrapped up in other games. I think it's great now with the exception of the crashes, which I'm sure will be fixed lol. Some people. I play fo76 too. People are harsh on that one too, although I have to agree with a lot of them
Didn't buy game because i didn't have money -------> apparently i got lucky
    Same here. Guess I won't be playing this anytime soon unfortunately. At least I'll be able to get Planet Claster on Steam now!
    I just torrented a post patch copy. I do this with all games before deciding whether to buy the full product.
>For anyone wondering, this post was at 0 for an hour after posting and was removed by a mod initially. They brought it back due to the post having some discussion.  

**Please mods be more neutral.** There was no reason to remove this post. You removed it because it was reported by pro-Hello Games/pro-NMS fans?  


Note there are dozens of duplicate posts like "Is anyone else enjoying the game" that the mods are leaving up, while actively removing posts that are critical or can be seen as negative. I don't know if they are just removing the threads because people report them (which is abuse of the rules and mod system).  

Also, **I requested the mods to link to the PC Issues and Fixes thread in the sidebar**, to help PC players, but they can't be bothered. They should sticky that thread, since the "Thank You to the Community & Brief Update" sticky is pretty useless (and clearly biased) at this point. That thread literally says they will start using Rule 7 to remove **certain** negative/critical posts from the subreddit. Why not apply Rule 7 to everyone, or just stop working with people to censor content you don't like in the subreddit.
    Some users have been reporting this thread for harassment and promoting hatred. I cannot understand this subreddit.
        I can. It's a classic case of fanboism. Believe or not, there have actually been cases that were worse than this. Not by much, but still worse. 
        What I don't understand is the people who love the game who are negative on this thread. If those of us who are upset that we purchased it get a refund we'll have no reason to hang around here bitching we can't get a refund.
            People get emotionally invested in things they buy or enjoy. They feel like other people not enjoying it is a slight against them personally. They want their opinion to be enforced by the fact that others also enjoy the same thing, reaffirming their belief that it was a good decision to buy it or that they're right to enjoy it. I personally don't understand that mindset because if you enjoy something, that should be enough on its own regardless of what others think. I mean, sure, I used to act like that, about music I liked/ didn't like... but that was when I was like 14 or 15, and childish. 
    It was probably mjpereira or however it is, he's 24/7 deleteing interesting posts and informative PSAs like this one. I can't understand how he was chosen to moderate this sub.
        Wow that's the one who deleted it initially.
        I'll probably get banned, because that mods a piece of shit who's so pro NMS it'd be shocking too find out he ISNT being paid to turn this place into the ever increasing echo chamber its becoming. Its a joke and they are helping no one stifling real discussion in the name of some pro NMS bullshit. 

Wonder how long till this is considered "harassment". 
            It is mindboggling he is allowed to continue modding. The whole point of reddit is gone with behaviour like this. 

Imagine if Microsoft had nestled people into the mod team of /r/windows10...
Re: edit 3

This post was removed by Automoderator for receiving a large number of reports. A few reports before the automatic removal Automoderator will send us a mod mail so we can make a decision on the post, hopefully before the reports go over the limit.

Unfortunately, none of us were around at that time, meaning Automod moved to the next stage, which is removal (as a safeguard). As soon as we heard of the removal, we reapproved the post.

As a general guide, if there's no reason given for a report, it was *probably* automod. We use the Moderation Toolbox extension to pop up a removal reason dialog every time we remove a post ourselves.

---

Speaking of reports, please don't abuse the system. Some of the reports on this post were inaccurate, or just plain rude towards the OP. 

I replied to a few of the comments below talking about the removal, basically a shorter version of this comment. Usually I wouldn't sticky a comment, but since this is about our moderation policy and how this subreddit runs, I think this is proper use of the feature.

---

Edit: it has come to my attention that automod didn't remove the post in the first place. One of our other mods removed it, OP talked to them, the post was reinstated.

I'm on mobile (yay travelling), so I couldn't verify with the mod log that automod did the removal. (If anyone know a reddit app (Android) that lets you browse the mod log, I'd be happy to hear of it). I checked the number of reports, saw it was above the automod limit, then wrote my comment.

If you *ever* have questions about our moderation policy, send us a mod mail. We're moderators, not the Ministry of Truth from Orwell's 1984.

Edit 2: edited edit to be a bit clearer. Sorry about the ambiguity.

---

Edit 3: I'm now getting asked about edit 17 in the post.

OP was banned for being rude to other members of the subreddit, which is against Rule 8. We don't mind civilised discussion, in fact we encourage it (which is why this post was quickly reapproved). However, if you're going to be rude to others, you're not welcome here.
    Wait what? /u/mjrpereira removed this post and I asked why even though there was a discussion going on. He then reinstated it. I had no interaction with Automod.
        Why the hell is /u/mjrpereira still a mod here when he is just removing posts without any good reason?

Admin please?
    >  One of our other mods removed it

You may wish to remove that mod's privileges.
    Now that you have announced that anyone can remove a thread they dont like via reports which have basically no consequence to the person falsely reporting, are there going to be any changes to the system?

e.g. if the amount of votes exceed a certain amount, do not progress to the auto removal stage?
        Yes. It is something that has needed to change for a long time. We've had that particular rule in the configuration since one of the early revisions, and it doesn't scale very well.

I left the exact number of reports unspecified an a small measure against it, but ultimately it has forced us into a position where it needs to be updated, and that's a good thing. I'll also go over other parts of the config to update them while I'm at it.
            I would love to hear some of those reports. I did get PM's about some of them :).
                PMed a summary of them.
                    Cheers! :)
                        Share, now :D
                        yeah you got to share it. just remove the nicknames of the haters so it's legal

And plenty of people who love the game have been rude. Are they all banned too or is it just those who disturb the circle-jer... uh vibe?

        I'm using Slide at the moment (seriously good reddit app), but it doesn't have the mod log. It does have mod mail and the mod queue though (and most of the other stuff too). 

I haven't tried the other apps on the store recently, but Slide was the first one to get good mod tools (iirc). Props to /u/ccrama for their hard work.
            Thank you very much, glad you're liking Slide :)

And I actually forgot modlog was a thing, I'll make sure to add that into the next update!
I just got denied
    The 2 week/2 hour window is for the process to be (mostly) automated. You can always open up a support ticket and request a refund regardless - they're just not under any obligation to provide it.

                        Just about every CS:GO cheater and their mother claims that they didn't do anything when they get VAC banned, so they always go on steam support and various forums looking to get their VAC ban reversed (which is impossible, thankfully)

My dad has a steam too and uses the same number. today my brother used my dads account and cheated and now my main account is VAC banned. It's true and here is proof, my father will now write too:

Hello I'm the father and what my son says is true, he did not cheat, it was his brother on my account. Please unban him valve

sincerely the father


Pls unban
                                I thought this was a real story, untill the end. hahahha.

I asked for a refund twice already. Once on the weekend and came out, and once today after reading the other PSA. And i got denied both times. I have explained it exactly as it is but I still get only the automated reply. No one even *reads* what I am saying, I get sent to a fucking computer.

Can anyone direct me to where I'm supposed to send this email to after all?

I was just able to get a refund for my digital PS4 code purchased from Amazon by calling amazon customer support and just asking if they were issuing refunds for no man's sky.

Banned from the sub!? How fucking pathetic.
I had 6 hours. This is my 2nd ticket, after submitting 3 refunds.

    That's the exact same message I got today
        Got the very same message from ole Chuck myself.

Thank you for inquiring about a refund for No Man’s Sky. There has been some recent confusion in the community about Steam refunds for this title. Our standard refund policy continues to apply to No Man’s Sky, and playtime continues to matter when refunding the product.

We’ve reviewed your playtime and unfortunately you do not qualify for a refund.

[deleted]
    I will be honest, before this game I have never pre-ordered anything. I knew I shouldn't but two days before PC release I did it. It absolutely burned me hard enough to convince me in the future (at least, I hope) to not pre-order anything. Wait until at least a day after launch before purchasing. Another bit of honesty, I literally caved and pre-ordered purely because I thought the pre-order ship looked really cool. Yeah...bad move.
    That's absolutely fair, I feel that people who did feel burned by it are entitled to a refund. Maybe, this game will be in a better state in a few months/years.
        [deleted]
            Or they took the advice of others and actually have it a shot. Then realized their initial feeling was true

Then there are those who didn't read up on it and thought it was multiplayer. Then got several hours into the game and realized it doesn't exist
            [deleted]
                Well, to be honest, that sounds right about any game with a sense of completing stuff (campaigns, side missions, gear upgrades, etc.), but for a game like No Man's Sky, that people where promised it would be an infinite universe with infinite animals/landscapes variety and many many things to do ("you can do anything", quoting SM), people might've invested these 20-30 hours trying to find out what to do and what is there that they're missing and simply come to a conclusion that it's pointless to continue doing so. 
Humble Bundle told me that the money has already gone to the developer and I'd have to ask them directly.
    Damnit......just finished submitting my refund request to the Humble Store..... T_T  

I like this game but it is NOT a $60 game.  I'd like my money back and I'll put it towards Battlefield 1 ;-(
Even Steam acknowledged that this game sucks.

How can you defend a game that allows refunds when you have 37 hours played?

I only kept playing that long in hopes that I would find something new, I never did after 25+ planets.

I got more entertainment from the drama of this sub.

Thanks OP for the heads up, got my refund!
    Glad you got it. I must have replied to at least 30 posts telling me that it was unfair that people were getting refunds after 2 hours. I had to explain that this is not the type of game that you can understand the flaws of in under 2 hours.
        My main beef is that they are still falsely advertising stuff in the game (dune worm, etc) in the trailers on the steam store. It's been more than 2 weeks since PC release.
    [deleted]
    >I only kept playing that long in hopes that I would find something new, I never did after 25+ planets.

Me too. I have~20 hours clocked (I'm sure maybe 5 of that is from being paused in game though) and that was a painful time playing purely in the hope fun was in the next system. Spoiler: it never was and I gave up. 

I'm hoping that desperation isn't going to cost me a refund now  (GOG).
I considered attempting a refund as some of the limitations of the game seem kind of insulting vs what was promised but after seeing I have 48 hours of playtime. Meh, got my money's worth and I enjoyed doing it. Even if it wasn't the wonder drug it promised. 
    I am not sure if I can be bothered.  For me it is more about making a statement.  If it took up more disk space then I would be more proactive about doing something .
        Ya, I totally get that a lot of people feel really lied to but honestly I avoided most of the promo material from a long time out, so the game was more of a mystery to me. I went in expecting to be able to explore galaxies and stuff. I honestly think the game will be a lot more playable for me as they add a larger pallets of both flora and fauna.  

Had I followed all the hype and promos I would likely be pretty mad, but archeage taught me its generally best to ignore all that shit because in the end it's meaningless. 
    Yeah, I agree with that. I've gotten more play time in this than I think I have in Fallout IV. 

I actually think it's really shitty that Steam is giving refunds for people, allegedly, at the 72 hour mark! I could see a little leeway on this game, but if you're over 10 or 15 hours you know what the game is, and you've prob read all the hate. 

There are so many negative reviews with over 40 hours of gametime! I barely play games I like for 40 or 50 hours, haha.

        Ya see if I put 40+ hours into a game that's not an MMO I feel like I have lost all right to complain about refunds or not enjoying it. Clearly I enjoyed it and clearly I got my money's worth. But I appreciate that not everyone views it the same way.

    Thread is 83% upvoted and you're the top comment. Criticism has been on the front page since release. Let's not act like people let down by the game are some suppressed minority here. 
        This post was initially fully downvoted and removed by a mod. I appealed to have it reinstated. He posted that when that was going on.
            I still think it's laughable to act like having a critical opinion of the game is somehow taboo or shunned here when it's been the majority of the front page discussion, memes and the like since release.
        Kinda fun to see that every time, like dude is calling someone an idiot for loving/supporting the game and wen he gets downvoted complain that he has a brigade against him cause he's at -2, and they he gets upvoted to +120. What's wrong with that sub lol.
            * Claim to hate Sean for lying to get people to like the game
* Lie about what's not in the game to get people to hate it

Sums up a lot of this sub's attitude since release.

Even lying by omission. Like the Big Things mod. *Horrific* pop in on medium devices but yeh let's stay silent when people bitch about it not being in the vanilla game. Convenient that they're all screenshots or a video of walking on the ground.

            *Get one Dowvote* "Help! I'm being oppressed!"

Believe me, nothing makes me happier than to see this news. There's officially no reason for those dissatisfied with the PC release to remain. Happy trails. 

                You replied to: 
>Shhh, don't disturb their hate-fueled narrative.

                > Get one Dowvote "Help! I'm being oppressed!"

It's the shadowy cabal known as /r/gamingcirclejerk. 

In a world controlled by """Sean Apologists""" where any reasonable criticism is automatically downvoted (and definitely not upvoted into the stratosphere and gilded fifty times, no siree) one small band of brave gamers is here to tell the hard truths the hordes of deluded fanboys need to hear - at serious risk to themselves and their livelihoods. Starring Redditors and their famed persecution complex.

        > there are hundreds of journalists giving reviews of the game, and thousands of youtube videos showing gameplay. if you bought it, its your own damn fault

I agree entirely.  However, I don't like seeing games making millions of dollars from hype based on almost entirely false promises.  So regardless of whether or not people should have known better, I'm happy to see them getting refunds.
    Yeah, just like all the death threats the NMS zealots were sending to that Wayne guy with the post detailing evidence of cut features

Wait
    This is the reason you don't pre-order games. I always wait till they at least have a bit to work out bugs and such before I buy them.

I was looking forward to this game, I had good hopes for it and may still buy it. But tossing them your cash before they have a product is the worst consumer practice and all it takes to stop all these bad games is to Just wait a few days.
Great to hear, Steam did something similar with Arkham Knight(even before the devs started offering refunds).
    That was a completely different situation. Arkham Knight straight up DIDN'T WORK.
        NMS straight up didnt work on release. AK ran at about 30 fps for me on launch, but NMS wouldnt even start most times.
Refunded the game, bought the soundtrack. Because that's the only thing truly memorable about this game in my opinion.
I'll definitely buy this game... but only when it's on super sale for like 10 bucks.
For those out of the loop, what happened / is happening?

Edit: comment section is pretty sad http://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/.
Got denied by the automated refund system (which was to be expected) and just now opened a ticket. Hope I get my 60 bucks back. 
No luck for me in France. I was denied from the standard refund form, and from the Support Ticket system. Played 8h total, with 2h only to get it running smoothly. For a $60 game :|
Every refund procedural.
LOL. Fans can continue enjoying the game but I see no reason to be kids and send hate PM to the author. Salty that less people will be playing this game or what? Whether refunds should be issued to those with enormous gameplay hours is a decision to be made by Steam or Hello Games, you don't get a say in deciding if other players get refunds or not.
Edit 1) I am a grammar nazi
Would just like to say its still very possible to get refunds! Ticket wasn't being answered, so I just tried and tried with the automated system and on my fifth try I got it. To clarify, I had around 8 hours played, so it should still be possible even without making a ticket.
    Fuck yea! Glad you managed to get it :).
    [deleted]
    same, keep trying and finally refund approved(automated system btw), ticket unanswered still. Took about 6-7 tries.
I got my refund this morning after 25 hours of gameplay. I wanted to like the game. Just no content whatsoever. And the dev never ever made a single attempt to address the angry customers or anything. Just lied and hid. Sony didn't put a fight up with me either regardless of playtime. I asked and received.
My purchase has been refunded just now with 16 hours playtime. They denied the refund 3 times before but now it worked. (worth mentioning I always copy pasternioed the text)

Edit: fck mobile
So any idea yet on why OP was banned from the subreddit?
    I assume because he doesn't worship the ground that Sean walks on.

My support ticket :(
After first manual ticket refused by steam I can no longer raise a manual ticket for No Man's Sky Steam have removed the ability to choose the game. No Man's sky does not appear when you type the name. 
This is the last straw for me with Steam.
Quite love the game, sure as hell not gonna refund, but this is great for people who don't.
I don't really get why both sides feel the need to hate at eachother though, live and let live.
Enjoy your 60 dollar game that you like better!

    [deleted]
    The moment one person fails to be civil, it just trickles down and it's been happening way too often.
        Like every movement, each side has their extremists. On one hand, you have a few people who think No Man's Sky players are idiots. On the other, you have a few rabid fanboys who can't find any flaws with the game and will put down any dissension. I personally like the game and have been having fun with it, but it isn't without its flaws. 
    I  concur, Glad to see people can have a refund if they don't like the game. OP have your upvote, i will not refund but this is useful info to spread.
    Because both sides see the other side as part of the problem.

For example you, by not refunding the game, are rewarding shady business practices.

On the other hand encouraging mass refunds is like telling the devs to pull the plug on the game. That's not really something a fan of the game wants, now is it?
    I feel like you and I would get along. Thank you for being sane.
    I played obsessively for 35 hours across a low number of days. Then started to see some imperfections that made me question how much more time I could get out of it. After 50 hours I felt like I was pretty done with it. I took a couple days off from playing it. Then I installed mods and now I'm on 56 hours. 

I wrote a negative review for it on Steam for a few reasons but I made sure to include the fact that I'm having a great time with it; I just realize that for the gaming community at large, I don't think they're going to get as much enjoyment as I am from it. It really is shocking to see the pre-release trailers and see what was cut, though. Really a shadow of what the game could've been unless the game is heavily modded or updated.
    I'm not happy with how the game turned out compared to what we were promised, even vaguely or indirectly. That said, I both enjoy the game a lot and have put in over 20 hours, so I couldn't really request a refund here in good conscience.
How long does it take for them to decide?

now i can spend 60$ buck on a REAL AAA game :)
Got my refund after 11 hours of game time. Fuck you Sean.
    how long did it take for them to respond???
If it's fair then you wouldn't have to mention " look some guy has even played for 70 hours and was able to get a refund" in all honesty that long a play time and expecting a refund is ridiculous.
[deleted]
Nice, time to buy that sweet Mankind Divided then!
Refunded around 9 times now still no accept just created a ticket and really hope it works cuz I really want dark souls 3 instead of this piece of crap.
**The following is the ticket statement I used for my support ticket on Steam. If anyone wants to use it for their refund ticket feel free**

I did a refund request on Steam but I got the automated response denying the refund because I have more than 2 hours played. I understand that your policy is indeed 2 hours played maximum normally, but in the case of this game I feel that it should be a different case.

I was led to believe that the game would be a certain way by trailers, gameplay videos and screenshots as well as development news and blogs from the game creators, but the purchased game is not at all what they promised. This feels like a case of false advertising and I would like to refund this purchase.

I am able to take the refund to the credit card I used for the payment, or my Steam Wallet is just as good for me. Thank you very much.
I'm torn. I've enjoyed this game to a point, but I do feel that a clear message needs to be sent about lying/false advertising. 
    Don't be, as it is clear from this thread that HG did an absolutely terrible job with this game. Refund it and move on to something better.
Trying to get a refund on ps4 not sure where to go for this
    Brah, read the OP. I put all the details in edit 6. Contact PSN chat, they will refund you.
I think if the studio had any sort of open communication I would have stuck with it but at this point I have no issue refunding the game.


    Exactly. No communication is just sad. We payed for their product because we were shown that it would be amazing, and it wasn't. The least they could do is give us some hope for said product.
How long does Support take to contact you when you fill a ticket for this? 

It's irritating how some got it in a matter of hours, and I've been waiting a day. 
It sucks how some people with 50+ hours got accepted immediately, but I'm sitting here with only 20 hours and nary a response. God damn it Steam. I know at some point they'll just cut it all together.
[deleted]
Well, after the tenth denial on a refund, I FINALLY got responded to on my ticket and was told I can't get one because of my playtime. It's a bust, boys. :/
So i just cited ACCC laws and got a rejection on the refund, i have 7 hours played.

Specially since in march this year valve got taken to court in Australia about them neglecting ACCC laws and have to abide by them when selling to consumers in Australia.

Under The Australian Consumer Law 

When a product has a major problem the consumer is entitled to a full refund.

A product or good has a major problem when:

- it has a problem that would have stopped someone from buying it if they’d known about it
- it is unsafe
- it is significantly different from the sample or description
- it doesn’t do what the business said it would, or what you asked for and can’t easily be fixed.

The developer of this game promised so many features for this game that were not included, The game does not work as intended with framerate issues and crashes. The community has proven that no multiplayer exists when it was said by the developer it would have been

This product matches 3 out of 4 reasons (it only needs to match 1) for a product being deemed as a major fault and should be given a full refund. 
I sent my Steam Ticket more than 24 hours ago, and still haven't gotten a response. At this point, the least they could do is give me a "fuck you".
refunded the game, best decision in 2016. This game's potentially gonna be one of those freebies on PS Plus soon.
People who opened tickets, how long did it take for Steam to respond? It's been 2 days and so far no word from them.
i put up a discord where we can join all together to make valve aware that we want also our refunds , everyone can join here https://discord.gg/2HsxWHb lets make it big ;) 
I've "played" for 14 Hours. Denied on the automatic system twice and denied via a support ticket. I'm arguing in the support ticket now and am currently collecting evidence of people getting refunds with more hours than mine. Are there any screenshots of people who are getting refunds on Steam with +2 hours?
Not sure if anybody has debunked this post yet but here we go. It's false. You will not receive your money back if it's been played more than 2hrs or is more than 14 days old.

Thank you for inquiring about a refund for No Man’s Sky. There has been some recent confusion in the community about Steam refunds for this title. Our standard refund policy continues to apply to No Man’s Sky, and playtime continues to matter when refunding the product.

We’ve reviewed your playtime and unfortunately you do not qualify for a refund.

Please review our refund policy here:
http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/"
This for me is not true.

- 48 hours played

- Steam refund auto rejected:

"We are unable to refund this purchase to your Steam Wallet at this time. Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum)"

- Raised a steam ticket - rejected with the following message:

"Thank you for inquiring about a refund for No Man’s Sky. There has been some recent confusion in the community about Steam refunds for this title. Our standard refund policy continues to apply to No Man’s Sky, and playtime continues to matter when refunding the product.

I just got dennied O_o http://prntscr.com/cbywoj
Got my refund. 12 Hours Played. Didn't work the first time, second attempt went throughyesterday.

Thank God. Terrible Game, too much hype, shady devs.
Asked and denied for over exceeding play time.  
    same for me tried it many times
Why are so many people refunding? Just curious if something happened.
What's the korvax word for refund again ?
This should be stickied.
The people here saying that this post should be removed and is offensive to this community make me lol...
I'm enjoying this game immensely and won't be asking for a refund. But props to Steam for offering them.

If you felt gypped you should get your money back.
They've denied mine 3 times
    Reapply and open a support ticket. Choose false advertising as the reason.
        Also it appears more likely to go through if you choose steam wallet.
got my refund. steam support was quick and excellent. I just copied and pasted the reddit post about broken promises https://m.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/4y1h9i/wheres_the_no_mans_sky_we_were_sold_on_a_big_list/

Just got a refund on PS4! I think I have 12ish hours played. I got on the PS chat support and all I said was the game was crashing constantly and that the promotional materials were advertising features that were not in the game. The guy didn't ask any questions, just stated this was a one time courtesy and refunded my PSN wallet.  
**This needs to be stickied.   It's not standard steam policy and a lot of people here who bought the game, but are dissatisfied, might not be aware.**
    We need more information. I put one in today and it was denied for having over 2 hours playtime, so I can at least attest that this isn't entirely true. I don't think I've returned anything on Steam before, nothing I can remember at least.

edit: support ticket for the refund was also denied.
Thanks. Figure I can always come back to it if they make it better. 
    Yup, hopefully more features will be added that will make it playable. 
Steam just refused to give me a refund while I only played the game for like 8 hours and 51 minutes i believe. I reapplied for a refund now, lets just hope I get my 60 euros back to buy a game that actually deserves that pricetag.
Rightfully so, that game is bad and deserves no profit.

"But quazillion planets, endless possibilities!"

No. You were wrong. If a game has no open information sharing, open beta testing, it's positively garbage, especially when compared to publisher's promises. Learn from this and don't hype up crap until you actually play it. Stop being sheep.
im on pc i requested a refund thru steam and they have denied me twice now . i do have 30 hours on the game . i will keep trying tho 
Infinite procedurally generated refund universe awaiting your exploration. Great replay value, since if you get denied at first, it may take you 7 or more refund requests to get accepted. I'd say playing the no man's sky refund game has more entertainment value and a better storyline than the actual game. 
its pretty childish they banned you. its like they don't want people to know the game sucks
I tried to get a refund, even after providing information that the game barely worked for me and it would crash frequently from framerate issues. All of my hours are from trying to get the game to work and looking for the game that I thought was sold to me. Instead I got this response from steam: http://imgur.com/gallery/djUgp

I'm done buying games from Steam.
Hey, just chiming in.

I got denied two days ago. I seen this post and resent in and got a success. Thank you so much for posting this. I've been stressing about it. 

I had 4 hours
Well, here goes all hope of NMS ever getting better or ever being fully fixed. 
    Quite honestly that's not our problem. 
Finally, a useful PSA for once. 
Lmao, this game is so insanely lied about that steam is offering extended refunds.  They didn't even do that for bombs like War Z.


Fucking good on steam for taking a pro consumer stance on this one.
    I am glad Valve is slowly inching to be more customer friendly.
Got my refund thank you steam. And Sean I hope every game you make in the future fails just for lying to us. 
    How long did it take them to reply to your ticket?
It works for me. I had 6 hours of play time
You are doing gods work.  Keep it up.
Time to spend $60 on a knife in CS:GO.
Great I'm gonna refund it with 60+hours playtime just to watch the butturt in this SUB reddit.
My refund was accepted after 34 hours of playtime on the PC.
    Did you do a normal refund request or was through a support ticket? I got denied at 12 hours using the refund request
    ticket or automated refund?
Just got a refund on PSN
For what use it is, I can also confirm. I used the standard steam refund, had 8.5 hours. 
I tried twice and no refund. Just sent a ticket, hopefully it happens.
Good job Steam
Op was pretty cool today. 
I come from /r/all, what did this game do to warrant so many refunds and upset players?
i really want this game to get better, but i don't think it will
i was soooo pumped for this and even pre ordered
I'll be holding on to mine, but thanks for the heads-up.
After 6 hours gameplay. And 3 previous attempts at refund. I got one yesterday. Full refund into steam wallet. 
Steam user - 7hrs playtime (over the 2hr limit) Refunded successfully.
Jeebus, 16,000 + returns thus far, imagine if IGN/Gamespot/Kotaku broke this news...ouch

http://steamspy.com/app/275850
Been denied twice now. Tried both refunding to steam wallet and to paypal with 15 hours played. Anyone know what else I can try?
    Send a support ticket after
I bought a PS4 copy, I didn't try get a refund but I did sell it on ebay. I made a loss of £4 in total, so £4 to try the NMS experience isn't to bad.
Wish we luck!

I just requested a refund via Steam with a long list of whys, lets see that happens. Just for the record I enjoyed my brief time in NMS however is this a buggy tech demo that should of been called “Pretty Space/Planet Wallpaper Generator”.

I would happily purchase the game again in the future if Hello Games fixes all the tech issues and patches the game to something closer to what Sean stated it would be. Sadly I can’t see Hello Games fixing anything more than some stability issues. The mention of possible DLC was the last straw for me :(

I didn't get one. Put in a ticket, hoping for the best.

I'd like to buy it again, if they hold up their end of the deal.
Lol i kind of want to ask a refund after how every patch now seems to kill my performance and getting to the point where I feel there's nothing else to look forward to, 

but... I have 40 hours playtime. To be honest most of that time was spent tunning the game and having to restart after losing my save twice, but I doubt they would see it that way right? Anyone with a high playtime was able to get a refund?
I have 94 hours of play time... I sent in my refund request so we will see if it works.
We are unable to refund this purchase to your Steam Wallet at this time. Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum).
No Man's Sky - Playtime: 13 hours 45 minutes

Purchased: Aug 11, 2016
just send a ticket. Hoping for a refund and buy mafia 3 :).. too bad this is what we got. game could be so much better..
I got refused by automatic support and send a manual ticket but got an automatic answer refusing to refund too. I suppose it's because we're sunday, better try tomorrow.
My refund was refused because I played more than 2 hours.
[deleted]
    [deleted]
How long should it take for my ticket to get noticed? So far it's been about 20 hours and still nothing.
20 Hours in game. 10 refund requests. 1 ticket. All denied, in ticket: Sorry but you played more than 2 hours go read FAQ. And i can't play the game because it became unplayble at later planets with 10 fps and crashes. So pissed >,>
20 hours played and have been denied by the automated system 11 times. Now they just said no to my ticket :(
I was denied from a staff member via a ticket. 12 hours. Sigh. 
Is there a link to the comment of steam that says it's no longer giving refunds?
I'd like to see it.
Unfortunately it did not work for me. I played 8 hours and wanted to refund, but it got denied.
I bought it on Steam for 59,99€ and played 8 hours as I said. Maybe it only works for some regions?

I have a slightly unrelated question.  If I buy a game from say Humble Bundle or another retailer where I get a steam key or even from the developer itself but they give me a Steam key, does Steam still get paid for that?

Ok i just finally got a response and they said i was denied.

I am unsure how this makes any sense since i only have 8 hours played yet i keep hearing and seeing people with around 20 plus hours get refunds so it is really hard to not get frustrated about this. 
I sent my ticket in like 7 hours ago :o havent had any response yet but i really hope imma get my money back god damnit.. im such an idiot for buying this game and trying to get it to work for so long.

Now i might be stuck with a 60€ reminder of my stupidity in my steam library :/

Edit: eh, they can deny me the refund all they want, im gonna keep sending tickets untill they accept it even if it takes me years to get my money back

Only 2 days after they decide to give people refunds and they completely disregard over half the people who own it on Steam; It really pisses me off that they think they can just choose whether or not you're worthy of getting your money back on a scam they themselves approved to be on the store page.
    I am guessing they didn't imagine the response would be this staggering.

Just got my game refunded (at least pending payment) after 8 or so tries. So don't give up.
Ok got a refund through the automated response after couple ot tries. Tried usinh the reason Bad perfomance, no multiplayer etc but the one worked for me was using  "I have another issue" and put on the note "Bad performance and false advertising"
I have 10 hours game time but in my refund statement i only have 20minutes of playtime lol.
I filed for a refund after 40 minutes of "game time" where 38 of those minutes was waiting for the game to start in between crashes.  I had collected about 40 carbon.  Subsequently I re-discovered EliteDangerous, which I can play with max graphics settings.  An expansion pack seems to let you land on planets now and drive around.
Apparently Steam got sick of this shit.  Looks like I will be stuck with NMS.

Tried twice on Steam , both times being denied because I played longer than 2 hours (13)
I played for 17 hours and tried to get a refund.  Using the option that said "multiplayer wasn't what i was expecting" and they denied my refund.  Anyone got any advice on how I could get a refund for this through steam another way??
i got denied with 24hrs rip
I don't think this is totally accurate, I've tried to refund three times and created a steam ticket. All denied
Anyone get a refund from humble bundle regarding this game?

I'd like a full refund to my credit card for this game, because almost every aspect and features of the game has been false marketed. There is no multiplayer, as they said there would be, the graphics and optimalization for PC is horrible and its an overall bad PS4 port. I tried to like this game, but i couldnt get myself to. Even though i have more than 2 hours of gametime on it, i'd still want a refund and i still want to try to get one.

Thank you for inquiring about a refund for No Man’s Sky. There has been some recent confusion in the community about Steam refunds for this title. Our standard refund policy continues to apply to No Man’s Sky, and playtime continues to matter when refunding the product.

We’ve reviewed your playtime and unfortunately you do not qualify for a refund.

Thats what I got when trying to refund multiple times.
Seems like they didn't really officially hand out refunds.

yeah im not getting a refund, this is the answer i got after 3 days waiting for a reply:

it seems that steam isn't allowing refunds anymore because after 4 refund attempt and then contacting support here was what i got:

Yep, seems like Steam has stopped refunding the game. Even manually. Got the same message as most of you, that a refund is not possible with my playtime over 2 hours. 

The "confusion" started with a lot of people getting refunds with a playtime way past the allowed 2 hours. Its kinda unfair to let some people get a refund and others not. 

*sigh* I'd say f*ck it. The people on the Steam support pobably don't have the authority to grant anymore refunds so bothering them won't do any good except wasting your and their time. If you had the money to pre-order, you can take the hit. 
not much luck so far. refund denied twice, support ticket opened, refund denied again. playtime 11h
Lol this reply from Tech Support >.<

so far steam has rejected all my refund tickets, stating the reason as i've played more then 2 hours, i have 25 hours played... just gunna chuck it up as a loss and don't bother at this point :/
I got this response:

**My Message:**
I have been waiting for this game sins 2013. And was determined to play it, and not give in to the internet hate that was happening. I worked through all the performance problems, making the game all but unplayable. But after the 8th star system, with the same crappy station and the same dude sitting there i just lost interest. This is a nice game for 20 euro's. But seeing as i payed around 60, i just expect better. I already created a refund ticket, that was automatically rejected i guess because of play time. I find this unfair, if you play for like an hour, you can't really judge this game, unless you go by hate on the internet alone.

I have no idea how every body is getting there money back from steam but i seem to miss the finesse or something
I asked for a refund the day it came out. Got denied. Didn't know about the manual support tickets at the time, unfortunately. When I found out about this a week ago I immediately asked for a refund by both automatic and manual replies. About 5 or 7 automatic replies denied, then 3 or 4 manual replies denied. At first it was, "you played too much" blah blah even though I talked about false advertising and bugs. Now they're saying that the refunds never happened and it was all lies.

I wrote massive manual tickets too. Full on video evidence of what was said to be in the game, but was not in-game, talked about bugs, crashing and stuff. They still didn't give a damn. I just wanted a refund to my steam wallet to buy something I could actually play.

Played a total of 11 hours total. Most of it was reloading and trying to fix it and change settings too. Spent more time in-game fixing and testing everything, no success on it working, nor a refund. 
After 20 or so rejections using the steam support, and doing 2 manual support tickets, I actually got the refund! Unbelievable I know, but it was the second ticket that worked for me. It took them over a week to respond to the second manual ticket, but they did grant me a full refund to my steam wallet. I had barely over 4 hours of game time on it, so it was not like alot of time. Here is the response I got, 

"As a customer service gesture, the purchase has been removed from the account and a credit has been applied to your Steam Wallet. The credit can be used for future Steam purchases.

Your current Steam Wallet balance is displayed in the top right hand corner of the Steam client window"
Thank you for this post. I did not know. Got me my money back. Fuck you, Hello Games
They sadly won't let me refund it.

I have played 7 hours by now.

I thought the game would be fun but it sadly isn't.


But it seems since I'm over the 2 hours play time not even a ticket will get my 60 euros back.

No, Sean Murray's nest egg.
If this was the case, I would seriously give it a shot. I would fix that damn warpdrive that breaks whenever I jump a black hole and go get that refund. 
This should be a lesson for all devs in the future to not exaggerate it with lies.
I think I actually have that word.
Amazing! Wow..
    [deleted]
        It's a testament to how amazing our support team is that refunds are even working at all.

Edit: Thanks to the anonymous redditor for my first gold :)
These refunds wouldn't even be possible if it wasn't for our development team!

*Amazing*
It's blowing my mind! Wow!
Wonder what that dude who paid $1,500 for a leaked copy is thinking right now. 
    "Someone just mentioned me on the internet still, so it was worth it."

Nah, he's probably just sad. If he has that much money to blow though it probably didn't hurt him too badly. One of those people that has more money than sense. 
    He has said over and over again on the stream he did (in which he donated 400 bucks to autism charity btw) that he doesn't regret the purchase in any way. Getting games early like that is a hobby for him and 1200 bucks isn't as big of a financial dent for some people. He was actually a really cool guy on the stream and I don't understand the hate that went out towards him other than pure jealousy.
        I had no problem with him until he said the game was a 9 out of 10. That was straight up misleading at a time when no one else had reviewed it.
        Not everyone understands other's hobbies. For example,  people get pissed if you buy a console/mac/Alianware, as they see it as wasting money. They're not jealous, they're just unable to understand why someone would ever do it. 
    What I don't understand is that he didn't warn people how shit of a game it was. 
        Post-purchase rationalisation perhaps? He did do a massive speech on (arr!)/gaming about why he bought it, people praised him and anyone who criticized him got shut down. But I guess thats what happens when hype gets out of control, it was almost cult-like.
        he did.

daymeeuhn was probably the only reasonable person in the NMS community, and yet he still got shit on by fanbois just for giving his honest opinion of the game. He said the universe was bland and it didn't get crazier as he reached the center of the galaxy, etc. Everyone just kept shouting at him, saying he had a preview copy of the game, and that release would change everything, etc.

He was calm in his responses and he gave pretty much the same review that everyone else did. He talked about how much the game crashed, and some of the other bugs he encountered. He said that the game should have been beta tested. Etc.

Basically, everything that the community needed to know about NMS was covered by his posts, several days before official release. Instead of listening to him, and putting the breaks on the hype-train, the community just yelled at him for posting 'spoilers' and they went full-steam-ahead into this disaster. 

It's kinda funny looking back at it now. Everyone was so afraid of spoilers, but there really wasn't anything to spoil. 
    If they can afford that I doubt they care
        They will care when they make more terrible purchases like that and then wonder where the fuck their money went.
Bruh. The real world around the game has features the game was supposed to have. More Real factions(pro-sean, anti-sean, modders, and those fucking portal lunatics), massive scale battles(any forum), a wildly varied economy(worlds largest launch! Lol 80% of players in 2 weeks and now refunds), and the modders are making discoveries left and right that nobody has seen before. 
Im wondering, even if it was potentially false news, why would one remove such a post. I mean the point system is already something that determines how "good" a post is right, so if something is "remove-worthy", it'll not get high anyway.
    Bored mods.

As someone who has been a moderator of a lot of things, and as someone who runs several subreddits, I find the mentality of a lot of moderators to be extremely frustrating, which is why I pick them very. very carefully.

'I removed it because the karma was low'

'You did what?  So what if the karma is low, karma is a system designed to make things less visible or more visible depending on its votes, it doesn't need help'

'I locked the thread because it got 'out of control'

'Unless people are posting dox, or being especially hateful, having passionate discussions is not 'out of control''



I've had to remove mods, who even after several warnings, did not seem to 'get it'

sometimes there's nothing to moderate. Sometimes (most of the time) you dont need to make any rules. (but certainly make some rules)


**Bored mods destroy empires**
        Oh man, you'd have a field day with the mods on the Steam forums.

        Looking at you r/politics. 
            Mod removes article with 4000 upvotes: 'Title not exact match'

Turns out it was a missing period


                Don't like that rule. What if the title of the article is misleading, inflammatory, or clickbaity? 
            Also r/news
            I think /r/politics is just pretending to be like /r/totallynotrobots 
                /r/politics caught the infection /r/politicaldiscussion got from /r/hillaryclinton, which was a lab brewed money virus that attacks facts related to Hillary Clinton while upvoting inflammitory antiTrump stuff. Did you know Trump is a jack ass? Go to /r/politics for all the latest specifics on that if you haven't gotten the jist by now.

Just don't mention Clinton in a negative way.
        that's what happens when you give some power to frustrated internet kids
            I shudder to think how many mods of subs with 40,000+ subscribers are children. 
                To give you a little insight on that, whenever a video game gets announced, a sub is created within minutes for that game.

Anyone, and everyone can become a mod, it's just whoever the fuck gets there first.
        /r/nfl is removing all posts about Colin Kaepernick protesting during the national anthem
        Subreddits such as this one are also more recently prone to clickbait posts because you can get karma from self posts now
    One of the mods recently explained an easily exploitable feature on this subreddit: If a post is reported by 7 different users, it's automatically removed.

EDIT: To be fair, they apparently receive a message when this happens, and they're given the ability to restore it.
        7 seems low for a sub with this many people 
            Subs get spammed a lot by bots. Most spam filters catch this, but sometimes you don't really want 20 people to have to see something before it gets flagged. It doesn't delete the post, it's just removes it until a live-mod can look at it. As this subreddit only has 12 mods and over 160k subs (with many MANY angry subs), it seems more than reasonable to allow the bot to flag and remove as quickly as possible, as it's better to have 1 mistaken good post than 10 shit spam posts. 
        This actually explains a great deal.
    Its not false news. just got my refund. purchased on launch day and put 10 hours in before i decided it really wasnt gonna get better.
        Not so much. 14 hours in 2 days. No refund.  
    > I mean the point system is already something that determines how "good" a post is right, so if something is "remove-worthy", it'll not get high anyway.

Truthometer: False.
        Hah!  Indeed.  The point system means that the majority of the most opinionated people who read it agree strongly with it or disagree strongly with the opposite of what it seems to be saying.
        Just once I would love to visit a sub with pop-up text over the downvote arrow that says "This is a disagree button."
[removed]
    A strong subreddit lets the voting system handle the posts.

Just look at any "new" section of the major subs. Complete garbage. And the community handles it fine with the voting system. Mods don't need to delete harmless posts. Unless it's literally calling for the death of someone, doxxing them, or doing something else obviously horrible, it should always stay. Mods deleting stuff because they don't like it is mods admitting this isn't a community, this is their sandbox and they allow nothing they disagree with here. Which is fine except we'll all leave and the community here will die if they behave like children by doing that nonsense.

A good example of a subreddit that allowed all the crap posts, and thrived because of it, is /r/PokemonGO. And you still had /r/TheSilphRoad if you wanted a more serious version. They basically allowed all the nonsense and rode the wave of shitposts and memes, because that's 50% of what their community was. That's a very nice way of handling things.
        It depends on the sub, honestly. r/TheSilphRoad had to crack down on shitposts to make it what it is today - when it was initially just r/PokemonGo with a bit of a superiority complex. It's not removing posts because "I don't like it", but because the posts don't belong in the subreddit based on the rules and spirit of the sub.

Of course, whenever the rules aren't explicitly black and white, disagreements will arise. It's on the mods to enforce gray-area rules from the perspective of the spirit of the subreddit, which is hard sometimes. For example, r/baseball is obviously a subreddit for fans of baseball, but we've had to add a rule restricting posts about player performances because people were beginning to post about entirely uneventful things. When deciding whether those posts should stay or go, I have to look beyond my own biases and fandom and determine whether the event is noteworthy in the eyes of the community. And sometimes I'm sure I'll get it wrong - I might remove something that would've been fairly well received, and I might leave a post that gets downvoted and ignored. But if the mods approach it from the perspective of the subreddit instead of themselves, it would work considerably better.
            /r/baseball mod! My fav sub. Go Cubs Go!
        > And the community handles it fine with the voting system.

Or a handful of people can literally take over a sub simply by hovering the new section. See: r/leagueoflegends/ for a while.

++
            This.  A small group, working together can pretty manipulate things on the front page on a lot of forums.  And even on the larger groups with a sympathetic (knowingly or unknowingly) mod, the same can happen.  By the very nature of the voting system and how the individual forum front pages work.
        The overwhelmingly most common incentive anyone seems to want to be a mod on Reddit is to inject themselves as a middle man between users and the voting system. Otherwise it's just volunteer service. The sort of people who rightfully see it as such and do it anyway as a good will to a community need more pats on the back. 
            Kind of like politicians.  The ones who want the job are the ones that shouldn't have the job.  
            I became a mod to be a CSS bitch and ride the hype of giving people flairs and designing a pretty subreddit. Now I'm a CSS bitch majorly ignored by the community
                Which kind of means you're doing your job well.  When the community notices you too much, as a mod, it's generally a bad thing.  Now your work on the other hand, hopefully they appreciate that, even if folks generally are quieter when satisfied than they are when the opposite is true.
                    When people wanted cat flairs I got daily messages for like a month. I finally broke after a mod mail, got off my ass, and made a ton of silly ones. You can see the result on the subreddit.
        >A strong subreddit lets the voting system handle the posts.

Not true.  Otherwise you end up with /r/gaming shitposts all the time.

Over on /r/XboxOne and /r/ps4, we have rules to keep content relatively high quality.  No memes, reaction gifs, or shit in general.

That said, I'd never remove a post if it didn't break any rules simply because it had low karma.
>Mods removing relevant threads and realizing their mistake

Amazing

On the first day?

Just amazing.
My issue is they aren't leaving a removal reasons for any of the posts that make the front page. Making it super irritating when something popular just disappears without a record of its existence.
Why on earth did they have to have a discussion about it?!

There is exactly literally zero legitimate reason for this to be removed, unless cheese pizza was edited out of it.
I posted a similar thread and was reduced to 0 upvotes and then removed as I was bringing awareness and process on how to get refunds. I'll post my bit over from r/gaming here;

Oh boy here we go; if you're after a refund try this to improve your chances:

* Open an actual ticket to try and get into contact with a REAL user, not an automated system.

* Mention about how the game was advertised and draw comparisons to the final product, make comparisons on the trailer & screenshots compared to in-game.

* Cite sources, cite interviews with Sean, youtube and article links.

* Make sure you give the game a negative review on STEAM, be constructive in this review as it will be compared against your case.

* Give specifics on your rig, specifics on crashing, frequency and performance issues.

* Be sure to emphasize how long you've been with STEAM and how you use their service and how you will seriously consider purchases with them in future if the refund isn't resolved (do this with PSN too)

* Be patient and sincere with your request, any profanity or outrage will automatically get your request ditched

* I imagine 10-15 hours of playtime is probably their threshold, if you've played 20+ I wouldn't bother.

Tacking onto this BE FIRM AS A CONSUMER. Put your foot down but don't be aggressive, remind them that you spent money on a product and you were misled. Remind them that you use/used their service for X amount of years, metaphorically remind them that their service depends on you spending money and feelng satisfied.
    I've worked in customer service all my life. If we offered returns on a product and you meet the requirement (in this case, owning the game and wanting a refund) then you got the refund. I'm sure you can just...ask for a refund through Steam. You don't need citations or specifics. You don't need to reiterate how good of a customer you are. I didn't care why your purchase didn't work out, and I'm sure Valve doesn't give a heck why you don't like No Man's Sky.
        Then you haven't had to deal with STEAM customer service, there's a very real difference that can be felt between physical item customer service and digital.

STEAM operate on a "work where you want" policy, and the majority of STEAM employees refuse to work customer service. It's their most undermanned department and Valve are ok with that. They will make you work for your money.
            Except this is a special case. As with Batman before it, they are extending their return policy to anyone that had the game regardless of playtime. There is no caveat, no asterisk. If you own it and want a refund you can have one. It's far different when dealing with normal Steam returns where, in order to even apply for a refund you have to have less than two hours of playtime and even then it's hardly guaranteed.
                It's not an automatic thing. I have asked for a refund three times now and still getting denied. I'll keep doing it until I get it, and I thank /u/TheMuteness for his advice
Imagine what a fucking loser that mod must be to attempt to defend this product from other consumers by obfuscating information as to their return rights.
they wouldnt let me as they said I put too much time into the game :(
    Maybe try again? I chatted with support and was initially denied, but I tried again and the second time they gave it to me. 
        I suppose it's the person you talk to that ultimately decides.
            It makes sense that they have no protocol for this, I don't blame them.
    That sucks :( how much time do you have? I put about 8 hours in and they let me.
Just done this, hopefully will hear back soon.
Yeah it's always worth a try with PlayStation. They've let me refund quite a lot of games. 
And Amazon just refunded my digital download, looks like they're getting a lot of complains, they didn't even argue... Hope more people do that and that the gaming companies learn a lesson (one can hope...)
Request refund in the normal way, you'll most likely get refused (automated reply). Then open a ticket, you'll get it when they reply.
    Stupid question, but how do you go about opening a ticket? When I go to steam support on the web, it only offers hello game's website as a solution for support. :(
        https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php
            It still makes me click a bunch of stuff and leads me to the normal refund page where I request an automated one and get rejected... how do you actually get in touch with anybody at steam?
                Here is what I did.

Step 1 

What type of problem are you having?

: Purchases and Payments (dropdown 1)
 
: Refunds (dropdown 2)

Step 2

Is the problem with Steam or with a game on Steam?

: Game or software on Steam (button)

: No Man's Sky (game name textfield)

Step 3

This is where you submit your ticket. 
                    thanks man I'll try it out!! 
                    What should the question and text be? I'm not sure
                    I still get refused. I'll try again, both ways
            Thanks!
    Weird. I refunded after 8 hours of gameplay and it got approved after about an hour
    Opened a ticket, refund was denied. :(
    What do you mean by "Open a ticket"?

    Funny cuz true!
    Wow so many people getting refunds! My mind is blown!

    I'm so sick of these refunders looking for refunds for all the wrong reasons.  Like they're looking for refunds like they're getting a refund for Call of Duty, or Doom, or some other mindless action blows shit up shoving beer and pretzels up your bros broholes game.  

I refunded for the art, for the journey, for the adventure.  I refunded No Man's Space for the Mind Blowing vistas of the refund request screen, the endless void of the refund request process, and the final, intense, deeply fulfilling, enrapturing pinnacle of my exploration, my final jump, to the center of the refund galaxy, when I finally am told that I am not eligible for a refund, at which point I have to go beyond the confines of the automated ticket process, into a new universe, the customer support ticket system, and where my journey begins anew!  

But hey, at least in this game, once I get to the end of the automated ticket system, there is something new and improved, the customer service ticket system, to serve as new game plus.  So Gabe Newell 1, Sean Murray 0
        I so badly want to create screenshot threads of the refund process and talk about how gorgeous they are. But I'd be downvoted, banned, and probably have a nasty Vice article written about me. 
Been denied seven times by the automated system. Sent a ticket in and haven't received a response, its been only a day though. Really hoping I get the refund. A friend had 9 more hours than I did and yet he got his on his first try -_-
When did you try? Today?
Honestly, him and his euro hipster team just spelled disaster from the get go. I expected crap from that demographic like I usually do and every time I'm not surprised.
Well, you know it is not. It is doing the same as it would for any game.
I feel you. I bought the fucking CE. Which still hasn't arrived...
    Being lost in the post is a very legitimate reason for a refund.
You got your discount!
GMG sucks.  Worst customer service ever
Hooooly shit, look at the [dropoff in peak daily concurrent players!](http://imgur.com/a/CbcMa)

From 212,604 at launch to 15,729 just 15 days later. That's an **over 90%** drop in players. 
    I've often felt like stats related to NMS have been overblown, but that visual perspective is just staggering. If you wouldn't have told me, I would have thought each bar represented a *week* for a run-of-the-mill letdown game.
        Keep in mind that that also includes all new players as the game keeps going.

The vast majority of players are playing NMS for a day or two and then saying "Fuck this shit" and never touching it again.


    Wow, so many of you are abandoning the game!
        My mind is blown!
        If even just 1% of you keep playing, that's still so many people!
            I'm sad the about 99.99% of ~~planets~~ copies will never be discovered
Is this really out of the ordinary though? Here's two other games that show a similar pattern. [Link 1](http://steamspy.com/app/359320) and [link 2](http://steamspy.com/app/292030)

Daily concurrent players is definitely telling, though.
    This also happens all the time when games release DLC. It happened with Titanfall, which was a fantastic game. Hopefully with 2 they won't make the same mistake.
In my refund request I mentioned the misleading trailer that shows features that aren't in the game at all.

Multiplayer removal is bad, but I could see them claiming it's not worth a refund because it's technically not mentioned in any of the "official" promotional material. But the trailer on the Steam page is brazen, totally inexcusable false advertising. I honestly think Valve should take it down; Hello Games is actively and deliberately lying to potential customers with that trailer.
    You're preaching to the choir here. I am in no way associated with HG. I am just trying to make sure everyone gets their dollars worth.
Thanks, that helped a lot! Already tried to refund the game yesterday but got rejected. Today I then opened a support ticket but got again rejected

Then I did it like you and it worked!
Don't get me wrong it's very impressive for an indie game, and I was in awe for a bit. Then my awe just... faded away.
    I'm with you. I refunded it, myself. If they had been more honest with the community, or if they had charged a price not on par with a AAA game, I would be less inclined to return it. As it stands, I will be glad to have my money back, and I won't really miss the gameplay. It became a grind for me about 5-10 game hours ago. 
        You know what the worst part is? There have been SEVEN patches on the PS4 and every single patch just says 'bug fixes'.

They COULD put patch notes, details, whatever they want in there. They choose to just say bug fixes.

If I could return a PS4 game I would definitely return this game.
            The lack of communication and transparency is the most damning thing for me. It's seriously not that hard. 
                it's not even lack of communication anymore.

it's pure ignorance - because there is no communication at all.
            Are we 100% sure Hello Games and Niantic are not the same company?
                r
                Lol! No mans sky and Pokemon go are the only 2 games I've ever refunded in my lifetime.
I'll buy it again when it's $20
I am in the "Keeping the game camp". I didnt have the launch issues on PC a lot of people had. The game looks and runs great on my machine. I am enjoying the game. Did Hello Games flub a PC port on a game orignally concieved to be PC only? Yes. Was Hello Game's and Sony's marketing ploys shady as fuck? Fuck yes. Was the game misrepresented in the advertising? Yes. Are all these good reasons for people to get a refund...uh yeah. So even if I didnt have almost 100 hours in the game I still wouldnt return it because I really am enjoying it. Does that mean OP should get my down vote? Nope. Upvote for you fom me. Because even though I am enjoying the game I still feel lied to. No giant fleets of ships going at it as shown in "Actual game play footage" No giant dinosaurs/sandworms. No large buildings/crashed ships to explore. It just goes on and on. The sudden backlash of funds being drained from the once filled coffers of HG and Sony will hopefully send a message that the industry will learn from...but probably not.

Fuck that dude, you gotta pick a side!!! That's what this sub is all about!!!!!!!!!!!
I didn't like the game and was going to just chalk it up to another example of not pre-ordering.... Then I found out what was in the center. That's the straw that broke the camels back for me. 
I got my 20hrs of fun out of it.  No need for a refund from me.
[deleted]
Au Contraire, this aged like a fine WINE

A true testament to Hello Games' competence as a game developer, even after the game was refunded who knows how many times, they still kept up and eventually gave us the game we have today

I personally dont play NMS (was just lurkin the sub like i usually do to other subs) but even i can see how much it improved after the absolute MESS that was the release.
???

the game is fun now
    Yes, this is why. They developed the game so much that the old comments are fun to read.
There definitely is! Check out this thread:

https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/4z3eyx/how_to_refund_no_mans_sky_digital_copy_for_ps4/
    Yep. I contacted Sony just now and got my 60 bucks back to the wallet. Time to buy a game that is actually worth the money.
        Battlefield 1
            PREORDER!!!!1!!
                What could go wrong?
                    Nothing, I prefer ordered a lot of games that were fine. No man's sky, total war Rome 2 and-

Don't preorder
                        I was so mad at the start of this comment.
        I'd rather have paid $60 for a fucking coin flip sim, at least then its gonna do what it claims to
They were willing to refund (to your account wallet) since launch. One time deal.  

Of course, with a lot of potatoes now wanting a refund dozens of hours into the game, things probably got murkier. 
    I got a physical copy... i tryed Craigslist, but there are literally 15 other people in my area selling it for $45.
        Use it as a drink coaster.

What about now?
[removed]
Glad to hear it. Tons of good games coming up.
Could you tell me how and who you contacted? I'm on PS4 as well and would like to give it a shot to get a refund.
    Check out this thread for how to do it on PS4:

https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/4z3eyx/how_to_refund_no_mans_sky_digital_copy_for_ps4/
That part is automated but you can open a support ticket.
    My refund request got accepted, note the play time.... http://imgur.com/a/1RBdp

        R 599, thats a lot of R's
            Thanks Niantic....

            If you wanted to know it's called the "Rand", the currency used in South Africa.

That 600 breaks down to roughly 41 USD. 
    How would one do that?
        https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php
    Can you explain how you went about it?  
I didn't even buy the game and I want a refund.
    I considered buying the game and I want a refund for 10 mins that took.
        I bought a copy of the local newspaper cause there was an article about the game and the first impressions of the article writer in there, and I want to get the cost of the newspaper refunded.
    Someone bought me the game and I want THEM to get a refund.
[This thread shows that you can get a Steam refund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4zslu6/psa_steam_is_refunding_no_mans_sky_even_if_you/)  

 I am not sure if some are getting denied (the tickets, of course automatic requests will get denied), but **you have a ton of people getting refunds past the time limits.**
    I got denied both by the automated system AND when I opened a support ticket. Both denials were based on time played.
        Use the words false advertising
        You have to keep opening tickets, sort of pestering them. A few people it took 10+ times to finally get a refund, some took just a couple times, and some on the first try. Just keep trying and you will get it. 
            In my headcanon there is literally one rogue support guy that had too high expectations and refunds everybody :D
If you get denied, open a ticket and keep asking. One guy it took him 10 times, then he got his refund. 
Glad you got it to work :).
Yeah, i have heard that they are really slow
They are already dead
    Numbers out there say they sold something like 700k copies. x 60 is 42mil. Steam get a cut, Sony get a cut, but still, even if it's half of the half of that number, it's almost 10mil. I wish i was dead like that.

    Well im sure they are still happy with the amount of £/$ they have got off people but in terms of future, i dont think anyone is ever gonna trust a word S.M or HG says 
        How many times did Molyneux do it to us? People have short memories.
            He already had an established reputation though, this was these guys' first time being on this scale.
                It should also be mentioned that Fable was still a good game, however not what we expected.
            Molyneux's games weren't actually mediocre like NMS though. Now I just said like an apologist. Murray outright lied whilst Molyneux doesn't understand what a limitation is.

> GOG

Isn't it a 'guarantee' for technical troubles only, though? Is it a 'no questions asked' refund? Did you get it?
    Well, in this situation, you could easily say it is technical troubles.
I sent in a ticket nearly 20hrs ago and it still hasn't been looked at yet. If people ahead of me got refunds with 20+ hours game time and I don't at only 6hrs because mine wasn't seen in time I'll be annoyed.
Same here. Guess I won't be playing this anytime soon unfortunately. At least I'll be able to get Planet Claster on Steam now!
I just torrented a post patch copy. I do this with all games before deciding whether to buy the full product.
Some users have been reporting this thread for harassment and promoting hatred. I cannot understand this subreddit.
    I can. It's a classic case of fanboism. Believe or not, there have actually been cases that were worse than this. Not by much, but still worse. 
    What I don't understand is the people who love the game who are negative on this thread. If those of us who are upset that we purchased it get a refund we'll have no reason to hang around here bitching we can't get a refund.
        People get emotionally invested in things they buy or enjoy. They feel like other people not enjoying it is a slight against them personally. They want their opinion to be enforced by the fact that others also enjoy the same thing, reaffirming their belief that it was a good decision to buy it or that they're right to enjoy it. I personally don't understand that mindset because if you enjoy something, that should be enough on its own regardless of what others think. I mean, sure, I used to act like that, about music I liked/ didn't like... but that was when I was like 14 or 15, and childish. 
It was probably mjpereira or however it is, he's 24/7 deleteing interesting posts and informative PSAs like this one. I can't understand how he was chosen to moderate this sub.
    Wow that's the one who deleted it initially.
    I'll probably get banned, because that mods a piece of shit who's so pro NMS it'd be shocking too find out he ISNT being paid to turn this place into the ever increasing echo chamber its becoming. Its a joke and they are helping no one stifling real discussion in the name of some pro NMS bullshit. 

Wonder how long till this is considered "harassment". 
        It is mindboggling he is allowed to continue modding. The whole point of reddit is gone with behaviour like this. 

Imagine if Microsoft had nestled people into the mod team of /r/windows10...
Wait what? /u/mjrpereira removed this post and I asked why even though there was a discussion going on. He then reinstated it. I had no interaction with Automod.
    Why the hell is /u/mjrpereira still a mod here when he is just removing posts without any good reason?

Admin please?
>  One of our other mods removed it

You may wish to remove that mod's privileges.
Now that you have announced that anyone can remove a thread they dont like via reports which have basically no consequence to the person falsely reporting, are there going to be any changes to the system?

e.g. if the amount of votes exceed a certain amount, do not progress to the auto removal stage?
    Yes. It is something that has needed to change for a long time. We've had that particular rule in the configuration since one of the early revisions, and it doesn't scale very well.

I left the exact number of reports unspecified an a small measure against it, but ultimately it has forced us into a position where it needs to be updated, and that's a good thing. I'll also go over other parts of the config to update them while I'm at it.
        I would love to hear some of those reports. I did get PM's about some of them :).
            PMed a summary of them.
                Cheers! :)
                    Share, now :D
                    yeah you got to share it. just remove the nicknames of the haters so it's legal

    I'm using Slide at the moment (seriously good reddit app), but it doesn't have the mod log. It does have mod mail and the mod queue though (and most of the other stuff too). 

I haven't tried the other apps on the store recently, but Slide was the first one to get good mod tools (iirc). Props to /u/ccrama for their hard work.
        Thank you very much, glad you're liking Slide :)

And I actually forgot modlog was a thing, I'll make sure to add that into the next update!
The 2 week/2 hour window is for the process to be (mostly) automated. You can always open up a support ticket and request a refund regardless - they're just not under any obligation to provide it.
    Stupid question- how do i do this?
        https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php
            Sorry, but VAC bans are permanent.
                I'll have to be honest with ya, not getting the joke. 
                    Just about every CS:GO cheater and their mother claims that they didn't do anything when they get VAC banned, so they always go on steam support and various forums looking to get their VAC ban reversed (which is impossible, thankfully)

Would you like to know more?
                        I'm not allowed to have my own cell phone so my dad forced me to use his phone number. My dad has a steam too and uses the same number. today my brother used my dads account and cheated and now my main account is VAC banned. It's true and here is proof, my father will now write too:

Hello I'm the father and what my son says is true, he did not cheat, it was his brother on my account. Please unban him valve

sincerely the father


Pls unban

That's the exact same message I got today
    Got the very same message from ole Chuck myself. 
I will be honest, before this game I have never pre-ordered anything. I knew I shouldn't but two days before PC release I did it. It absolutely burned me hard enough to convince me in the future (at least, I hope) to not pre-order anything. Wait until at least a day after launch before purchasing. Another bit of honesty, I literally caved and pre-ordered purely because I thought the pre-order ship looked really cool. Yeah...bad move.
That's absolutely fair, I feel that people who did feel burned by it are entitled to a refund. Maybe, this game will be in a better state in a few months/years.
    [deleted]
        Or they took the advice of others and actually have it a shot. Then realized their initial feeling was true

Then there are those who didn't read up on it and thought it was multiplayer. Then got several hours into the game and realized it doesn't exist
        [deleted]
            Well, to be honest, that sounds right about any game with a sense of completing stuff (campaigns, side missions, gear upgrades, etc.), but for a game like No Man's Sky, that people where promised it would be an infinite universe with infinite animals/landscapes variety and many many things to do ("you can do anything", quoting SM), people might've invested these 20-30 hours trying to find out what to do and what is there that they're missing and simply come to a conclusion that it's pointless to continue doing so. 
Damnit......just finished submitting my refund request to the Humble Store..... T_T  

I like this game but it is NOT a $60 game.  I'd like my money back and I'll put it towards Battlefield 1 ;-(
Glad you got it. I must have replied to at least 30 posts telling me that it was unfair that people were getting refunds after 2 hours. I had to explain that this is not the type of game that you can understand the flaws of in under 2 hours.
    My main beef is that they are still falsely advertising stuff in the game (dune worm, etc) in the trailers on the steam store. It's been more than 2 weeks since PC release.
[deleted]
>I only kept playing that long in hopes that I would find something new, I never did after 25+ planets.

Me too. I have~20 hours clocked (I'm sure maybe 5 of that is from being paused in game though) and that was a painful time playing purely in the hope fun was in the next system. Spoiler: it never was and I gave up. 

I'm hoping that desperation isn't going to cost me a refund now  (GOG).
I am not sure if I can be bothered.  For me it is more about making a statement.  If it took up more disk space then I would be more proactive about doing something .
    Ya, I totally get that a lot of people feel really lied to but honestly I avoided most of the promo material from a long time out, so the game was more of a mystery to me. I went in expecting to be able to explore galaxies and stuff. I honestly think the game will be a lot more playable for me as they add a larger pallets of both flora and fauna.  

Had I followed all the hype and promos I would likely be pretty mad, but archeage taught me its generally best to ignore all that shit because in the end it's meaningless. 
Yeah, I agree with that. I've gotten more play time in this than I think I have in Fallout IV. 

I actually think it's really shitty that Steam is giving refunds for people, allegedly, at the 72 hour mark! I could see a little leeway on this game, but if you're over 10 or 15 hours you know what the game is, and you've prob read all the hate. 

There are so many negative reviews with over 40 hours of gametime! I barely play games I like for 40 or 50 hours, haha.

    Ya see if I put 40+ hours into a game that's not an MMO I feel like I have lost all right to complain about refunds or not enjoying it. Clearly I enjoyed it and clearly I got my money's worth. But I appreciate that not everyone views it the same way. 
Thread is 83% upvoted and you're the top comment. Criticism has been on the front page since release. Let's not act like people let down by the game are some suppressed minority here. 
    This post was initially fully downvoted and removed by a mod. I appealed to have it reinstated. He posted that when that was going on.
        I still think it's laughable to act like having a critical opinion of the game is somehow taboo or shunned here when it's been the majority of the front page discussion, memes and the like since release.
    Kinda fun to see that every time, like dude is calling someone an idiot for loving/supporting the game and wen he gets downvoted complain that he has a brigade against him cause he's at -2, and they he gets upvoted to +120. What's wrong with that sub lol.
        * Claim to hate Sean for lying to get people to like the game
* Lie about what's not in the game to get people to hate it

Sums up a lot of this sub's attitude since release.

Even lying by omission. Like the Big Things mod. *Horrific* pop in on medium devices but yeh let's stay silent when people bitch about it not being in the vanilla game. Convenient that they're all screenshots or a video of walking on the ground.

        *Get one Dowvote* "Help! I'm being oppressed!"

>Shhh, don't disturb their hate-fueled narrative.

It's the shadowy cabal known as /r/gamingcirclejerk. 

In a world controlled by """Sean Apologists""" where any reasonable criticism is automatically downvoted (and definitely not upvoted into the stratosphere and gilded fifty times, no siree) one small band of brave gamers is here to tell the hard truths the hordes of deluded fanboys need to hear - at serious risk to themselves and their livelihoods. Starring Redditors and their famed persecution complex.

    > there are hundreds of journalists giving reviews of the game, and thousands of youtube videos showing gameplay. if you bought it, its your own damn fault

I agree entirely.  However, I don't like seeing games making millions of dollars from hype based on almost entirely false promises.  So regardless of whether or not people should have known better, I'm happy to see them getting refunds.
Yeah, just like all the death threats the NMS zealots were sending to that Wayne guy with the post detailing evidence of cut features

Wait
This is the reason you don't pre-order games. I always wait till they at least have a bit to work out bugs and such before I buy them.

I was looking forward to this game, I had good hopes for it and may still buy it. But tossing them your cash before they have a product is the worst consumer practice and all it takes to stop all these bad games is to Just wait a few days.
That was a completely different situation. Arkham Knight straight up DIDN'T WORK.
    NMS straight up didnt work on release. AK ran at about 30 fps for me on launch, but NMS wouldnt even start most times.
Fuck yea! Glad you managed to get it :).

same, keep trying and finally refund approved(automated system btw), ticket unanswered still. Took about 6-7 tries.

The moment one person fails to be civil, it just trickles down and it's been happening way too often.
    Like every movement, each side has their extremists. On one hand, you have a few people who think No Man's Sky players are idiots. On the other, you have a few rabid fanboys who can't find any flaws with the game and will put down any dissension. I personally like the game and have been having fun with it, but it isn't without its flaws. 
I  concur, Glad to see people can have a refund if they don't like the game. OP have your upvote, i will not refund but this is useful info to spread.
Because both sides see the other side as part of the problem.

For example you, by not refunding the game, are rewarding shady business practices.

On the other hand encouraging mass refunds is like telling the devs to pull the plug on the game. That's not really something a fan of the game wants, now is it?
I feel like you and I would get along. Thank you for being sane.
I played obsessively for 35 hours across a low number of days. Then started to see some imperfections that made me question how much more time I could get out of it. After 50 hours I felt like I was pretty done with it. I took a couple days off from playing it. Then I installed mods and now I'm on 56 hours. 

I wrote a negative review for it on Steam for a few reasons but I made sure to include the fact that I'm having a great time with it; I just realize that for the gaming community at large, I don't think they're going to get as much enjoyment as I am from it. It really is shocking to see the pre-release trailers and see what was cut, though. Really a shadow of what the game could've been unless the game is heavily modded or updated.
I'm not happy with how the game turned out compared to what we were promised, even vaguely or indirectly. That said, I both enjoy the game a lot and have put in over 20 hours, so I couldn't really request a refund here in good conscience.
how long did it take for them to respond???
Don't be, as it is clear from this thread that HG did an absolutely terrible job with this game. Refund it and move on to something better.
Brah, read the OP. I put all the details in edit 6. Contact PSN chat, they will refund you.
Exactly. No communication is just sad. We payed for their product because we were shown that it would be amazing, and it wasn't. The least they could do is give us some hope for said product.
same for me tried it many times
Reapply and open a support ticket. Choose false advertising as the reason.
    Also it appears more likely to go through if you choose steam wallet.
We need more information. I put one in today and it was denied for having over 2 hours playtime, so I can at least attest that this isn't entirely true. I don't think I've returned anything on Steam before, nothing I can remember at least.

edit: support ticket for the refund was also denied.
Yup, hopefully more features will be added that will make it playable. 
Quite honestly that's not our problem. 
I am glad Valve is slowly inching to be more customer friendly.
How long did it take them to reply to your ticket?
Did you do a normal refund request or was through a support ticket? I got denied at 12 hours using the refund request
ticket or automated refund?
Send a support ticket after

    It's a testament to how amazing our support team is that refunds are even working at all.

Edit: Thanks to the anonymous redditor for my first gold :)
"Someone just mentioned me on the internet still, so it was worth it."

Nah, he's probably just sad. If he has that much money to blow though it probably didn't hurt him too badly. One of those people that has more money than sense. 
He has said over and over again on the stream he did (in which he donated 400 bucks to autism charity btw) that he doesn't regret the purchase in any way. Getting games early like that is a hobby for him and 1200 bucks isn't as big of a financial dent for some people. He was actually a really cool guy on the stream and I don't understand the hate that went out towards him other than pure jealousy.
    I had no problem with him until he said the game was a 9 out of 10. That was straight up misleading at a time when no one else had reviewed it.
    Not everyone understands other's hobbies. For example,  people get pissed if you buy a console/mac/Alianware, as they see it as wasting money. They're not jealous, they're just unable to understand why someone would ever do it. 
What I don't understand is that he didn't warn people how shit of a game it was. 
    Post-purchase rationalisation perhaps? He did do a massive speech on (arr!)/gaming about why he bought it, people praised him and anyone who criticized him got shut down. But I guess thats what happens when hype gets out of control, it was almost cult-like.
    he did.

daymeeuhn was probably the only reasonable person in the NMS community, and yet he still got shit on by fanbois just for giving his honest opinion of the game. He said the universe was bland and it didn't get crazier as he reached the center of the galaxy, etc. Everyone just kept shouting at him, saying he had a preview copy of the game, and that release would change everything, etc.

He was calm in his responses and he gave pretty much the same review that everyone else did. He talked about how much the game crashed, and some of the other bugs he encountered. He said that the game should have been beta tested. Etc.

Basically, everything that the community needed to know about NMS was covered by his posts, several days before official release. Instead of listening to him, and putting the breaks on the hype-train, the community just yelled at him for posting 'spoilers' and they went full-steam-ahead into this disaster. 

It's kinda funny looking back at it now. Everyone was so afraid of spoilers, but there really wasn't anything to spoil. 
If they can afford that I doubt they care
    They will care when they make more terrible purchases like that and then wonder where the fuck their money went.
Bored mods.

As someone who has been a moderator of a lot of things, and as someone who runs several subreddits, I find the mentality of a lot of moderators to be extremely frustrating, which is why I pick them very. very carefully.

'I removed it because the karma was low'

'You did what?  So what if the karma is low, karma is a system designed to make things less visible or more visible depending on its votes, it doesn't need help'

'I locked the thread because it got 'out of control'

'Unless people are posting dox, or being especially hateful, having passionate discussions is not 'out of control''



I've had to remove mods, who even after several warnings, did not seem to 'get it'

sometimes there's nothing to moderate. Sometimes (most of the time) you dont need to make any rules. (but certainly make some rules)


**Bored mods destroy empires**
    Oh man, you'd have a field day with the mods on the Steam forums.
[deleted]
    Looking at you r/politics. 
        Mod removes article with 4000 upvotes: 'Title not exact match'

Turns out it was a missing period


            Don't like that rule. What if the title of the article is misleading, inflammatory, or clickbaity? 
        Also r/news
        I think /r/politics is just pretending to be like /r/totallynotrobots 
            /r/politics caught the infection /r/politicaldiscussion got from /r/hillaryclinton, which was a lab brewed money virus that attacks facts related to Hillary Clinton while upvoting inflammitory antiTrump stuff. Did you know Trump is a jack ass? Go to /r/politics for all the latest specifics on that if you haven't gotten the jist by now.

Just don't mention Clinton in a negative way.
    that's what happens when you give some power to frustrated internet kids
        I shudder to think how many mods of subs with 40,000+ subscribers are children. 
            To give you a little insight on that, whenever a video game gets announced, a sub is created within minutes for that game.

Anyone, and everyone can become a mod, it's just whoever the fuck gets there first.
    /r/nfl is removing all posts about Colin Kaepernick protesting during the national anthem
    Subreddits such as this one are also more recently prone to clickbait posts because you can get karma from self posts now
One of the mods recently explained an easily exploitable feature on this subreddit: If a post is reported by 7 different users, it's automatically removed.

EDIT: To be fair, they apparently receive a message when this happens, and they're given the ability to restore it.
    7 seems low for a sub with this many people 
        Subs get spammed a lot by bots. Most spam filters catch this, but sometimes you don't really want 20 people to have to see something before it gets flagged. It doesn't delete the post, it's just removes it until a live-mod can look at it. As this subreddit only has 12 mods and over 160k subs (with many MANY angry subs), it seems more than reasonable to allow the bot to flag and remove as quickly as possible, as it's better to have 1 mistaken good post than 10 shit spam posts. 
    This actually explains a great deal.
Its not false news. just got my refund. purchased on launch day and put 10 hours in before i decided it really wasnt gonna get better.
    Not so much. 14 hours in 2 days. No refund.  
> I mean the point system is already something that determines how "good" a post is right, so if something is "remove-worthy", it'll not get high anyway.

Truthometer: False.
    Hah!  Indeed.  The point system means that the majority of the most opinionated people who read it agree strongly with it or disagree strongly with the opposite of what it seems to be saying.
    Just once I would love to visit a sub with pop-up text over the downvote arrow that says "This is a disagree button."
A strong subreddit lets the voting system handle the posts.

Just look at any "new" section of the major subs. Complete garbage. And the community handles it fine with the voting system. Mods don't need to delete harmless posts. Unless it's literally calling for the death of someone, doxxing them, or doing something else obviously horrible, it should always stay. Mods deleting stuff because they don't like it is mods admitting this isn't a community, this is their sandbox and they allow nothing they disagree with here. Which is fine except we'll all leave and the community here will die if they behave like children by doing that nonsense.

A good example of a subreddit that allowed all the crap posts, and thrived because of it, is /r/PokemonGO. And you still had /r/TheSilphRoad if you wanted a more serious version. They basically allowed all the nonsense and rode the wave of shitposts and memes, because that's 50% of what their community was. That's a very nice way of handling things.
    It depends on the sub, honestly. r/TheSilphRoad had to crack down on shitposts to make it what it is today - when it was initially just r/PokemonGo with a bit of a superiority complex. It's not removing posts because "I don't like it", but because the posts don't belong in the subreddit based on the rules and spirit of the sub.

Of course, whenever the rules aren't explicitly black and white, disagreements will arise. It's on the mods to enforce gray-area rules from the perspective of the spirit of the subreddit, which is hard sometimes. For example, r/baseball is obviously a subreddit for fans of baseball, but we've had to add a rule restricting posts about player performances because people were beginning to post about entirely uneventful things. When deciding whether those posts should stay or go, I have to look beyond my own biases and fandom and determine whether the event is noteworthy in the eyes of the community. And sometimes I'm sure I'll get it wrong - I might remove something that would've been fairly well received, and I might leave a post that gets downvoted and ignored. But if the mods approach it from the perspective of the subreddit instead of themselves, it would work considerably better.
        /r/baseball mod! My fav sub. Go Cubs Go!
    > And the community handles it fine with the voting system.

Or a handful of people can literally take over a sub simply by hovering the new section. See: r/leagueoflegends/ for a while.

++
        This.  A small group, working together can pretty manipulate things on the front page on a lot of forums.  And even on the larger groups with a sympathetic (knowingly or unknowingly) mod, the same can happen.  By the very nature of the voting system and how the individual forum front pages work.
    The overwhelmingly most common incentive anyone seems to want to be a mod on Reddit is to inject themselves as a middle man between users and the voting system. Otherwise it's just volunteer service. The sort of people who rightfully see it as such and do it anyway as a good will to a community need more pats on the back. 
        Kind of like politicians.  The ones who want the job are the ones that shouldn't have the job.  
        I became a mod to be a CSS bitch and ride the hype of giving people flairs and designing a pretty subreddit. Now I'm a CSS bitch majorly ignored by the community
            Which kind of means you're doing your job well.  When the community notices you too much, as a mod, it's generally a bad thing.  Now your work on the other hand, hopefully they appreciate that, even if folks generally are quieter when satisfied than they are when the opposite is true.
                When people wanted cat flairs I got daily messages for like a month. I finally broke after a mod mail, got off my ass, and made a ton of silly ones. You can see the result on the subreddit.
    >A strong subreddit lets the voting system handle the posts.

Not true.  Otherwise you end up with /r/gaming shitposts all the time.

Over on /r/XboxOne and /r/ps4, we have rules to keep content relatively high quality.  No memes, reaction gifs, or shit in general.

That said, I'd never remove a post if it didn't break any rules simply because it had low karma.
I've worked in customer service all my life. If we offered returns on a product and you meet the requirement (in this case, owning the game and wanting a refund) then you got the refund. I'm sure you can just...ask for a refund through Steam. You don't need citations or specifics. You don't need to reiterate how good of a customer you are. I didn't care why your purchase didn't work out, and I'm sure Valve doesn't give a heck why you don't like No Man's Sky.
    Then you haven't had to deal with STEAM customer service, there's a very real difference that can be felt between physical item customer service and digital.

STEAM operate on a "work where you want" policy, and the majority of STEAM employees refuse to work customer service. It's their most undermanned department and Valve are ok with that. They will make you work for your money.
        Except this is a special case. As with Batman before it, they are extending their return policy to anyone that had the game regardless of playtime. There is no caveat, no asterisk. If you own it and want a refund you can have one. It's far different when dealing with normal Steam returns where, in order to even apply for a refund you have to have less than two hours of playtime and even then it's hardly guaranteed.
            It's not an automatic thing. I have asked for a refund three times now and still getting denied. I'll keep doing it until I get it, and I thank /u/TheMuteness for his advice
Maybe try again? I chatted with support and was initially denied, but I tried again and the second time they gave it to me. 
    I suppose it's the person you talk to that ultimately decides.
        It makes sense that they have no protocol for this, I don't blame them.
That sucks :( how much time do you have? I put about 8 hours in and they let me.
Stupid question, but how do you go about opening a ticket? When I go to steam support on the web, it only offers hello game's website as a solution for support. :(
    https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php
        It still makes me click a bunch of stuff and leads me to the normal refund page where I request an automated one and get rejected... how do you actually get in touch with anybody at steam?
            Here is what I did.

Step 1 

What type of problem are you having?

: Purchases and Payments (dropdown 1)
 
: Refunds (dropdown 2)

Step 2

Is the problem with Steam or with a game on Steam?

: Game or software on Steam (button)

: No Man's Sky (game name textfield)

Step 3

This is where you submit your ticket. 
                thanks man I'll try it out!! 
                What should the question and text be? I'm not sure
                I still get refused. I'll try again, both ways
        Thanks!
Weird. I refunded after 8 hours of gameplay and it got approved after about an hour
Opened a ticket, refund was denied. :(
What do you mean by "Open a ticket"?
    https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php
I wish this was a more common meme, I like it :)

    It can be, if we work together. 
        I'll be your copilot anytime.
            I appreciate the sentiment, but that feature wasn't implemented. 
[deleted]
    We're implementing a scanner to make it easier to get your refund. We definitely want to encourage this kind of thing. 
Funny cuz true!
Wow so many people getting refunds! My mind is blown!

I'm so sick of these refunders looking for refunds for all the wrong reasons.  Like they're looking for refunds like they're getting a refund for Call of Duty, or Doom, or some other mindless action blows shit up shoving beer and pretzels up your bros broholes game.  

I refunded for the art, for the journey, for the adventure.  I refunded No Man's Space for the Mind Blowing vistas of the refund request screen, the endless void of the refund request process, and the final, intense, deeply fulfilling, enrapturing pinnacle of my exploration, my final jump, to the center of the refund galaxy, when I finally am told that I am not eligible for a refund, at which point I have to go beyond the confines of the automated ticket process, into a new universe, the customer support ticket system, and where my journey begins anew!  

But hey, at least in this game, once I get to the end of the automated ticket system, there is something new and improved, the customer service ticket system, to serve as new game plus.  So Gabe Newell 1, Sean Murray 0
    I so badly want to create screenshot threads of the refund process and talk about how gorgeous they are. But I'd be downvoted, banned, and probably have a nasty Vice article written about me. 
Being lost in the post is a very legitimate reason for a refund.
I've often felt like stats related to NMS have been overblown, but that visual perspective is just staggering. If you wouldn't have told me, I would have thought each bar represented a *week* for a run-of-the-mill letdown game.
    Keep in mind that that also includes all new players as the game keeps going.

The vast majority of players are playing NMS for a day or two and then saying "Fuck this shit" and never touching it again.


Wow, so many of you are abandoning the game!
    My mind is blown!
    If even just 1% of you keep playing, that's still so many people!
        I'm sad the about 99.99% of ~~planets~~ copies will never be discovered
This also happens all the time when games release DLC. It happened with Titanfall, which was a fantastic game. Hopefully with 2 they won't make the same mistake.
You're preaching to the choir here. I am in no way associated with HG. I am just trying to make sure everyone gets their dollars worth.
I'm with you. I refunded it, myself. If they had been more honest with the community, or if they had charged a price not on par with a AAA game, I would be less inclined to return it. As it stands, I will be glad to have my money back, and I won't really miss the gameplay. It became a grind for me about 5-10 game hours ago. 
    You know what the worst part is? There have been SEVEN patches on the PS4 and every single patch just says 'bug fixes'.

They COULD put patch notes, details, whatever they want in there. They choose to just say bug fixes.

If I could return a PS4 game I would definitely return this game.
        The lack of communication and transparency is the most damning thing for me. It's seriously not that hard. 
            it's not even lack of communication anymore.

it's pure ignorance - because there is no communication at all.
        Are we 100% sure Hello Games and Niantic are not the same company?

Yes, this is why. They developed the game so much that the old comments are fun to read.

    https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php
Can you explain how you went about it?  
I considered buying the game and I want a refund for 10 mins that took.
    I bought a copy of the local newspaper cause there was an article about the game and the first impressions of the article writer in there, and I want to get the cost of the newspaper refunded.
Someone bought me the game and I want THEM to get a refund.
I got denied both by the automated system AND when I opened a support ticket. Both denials were based on time played.
    Use the words false advertising
    You have to keep opening tickets, sort of pestering them. A few people it took 10+ times to finally get a refund, some took just a couple times, and some on the first try. Just keep trying and you will get it. 
        In my headcanon there is literally one rogue support guy that had too high expectations and refunds everybody :D
Numbers out there say they sold something like 700k copies. x 60 is 42mil. Steam get a cut, Sony get a cut, but still, even if it's half of the half of that number, it's almost 10mil. I wish i was dead like that.

Well im sure they are still happy with the amount of £/$ they have got off people but in terms of future, i dont think anyone is ever gonna trust a word S.M or HG says 
    How many times did Molyneux do it to us? People have short memories.
        He already had an established reputation though, this was these guys' first time being on this scale.
            It should also be mentioned that Fable was still a good game, however not what we expected.
        Molyneux's games weren't actually mediocre like NMS though. Now I just said like an apologist. Murray outright lied whilst Molyneux doesn't understand what a limitation is.
Well, in this situation, you could easily say it is technical troubles.
I can. It's a classic case of fanboism. Believe or not, there have actually been cases that were worse than this. Not by much, but still worse. 
What I don't understand is the people who love the game who are negative on this thread. If those of us who are upset that we purchased it get a refund we'll have no reason to hang around here bitching we can't get a refund.
    People get emotionally invested in things they buy or enjoy. They feel like other people not enjoying it is a slight against them personally. They want their opinion to be enforced by the fact that others also enjoy the same thing, reaffirming their belief that it was a good decision to buy it or that they're right to enjoy it. I personally don't understand that mindset because if you enjoy something, that should be enough on its own regardless of what others think. I mean, sure, I used to act like that, about music I liked/ didn't like... but that was when I was like 14 or 15, and childish. 
Wow that's the one who deleted it initially.
I'll probably get banned, because that mods a piece of shit who's so pro NMS it'd be shocking too find out he ISNT being paid to turn this place into the ever increasing echo chamber its becoming. Its a joke and they are helping no one stifling real discussion in the name of some pro NMS bullshit. 

Wonder how long till this is considered "harassment". 
    It is mindboggling he is allowed to continue modding. The whole point of reddit is gone with behaviour like this. 

Imagine if Microsoft had nestled people into the mod team of /r/windows10...
Why the hell is /u/mjrpereira still a mod here when he is just removing posts without any good reason?

Admin please?
Yes. It is something that has needed to change for a long time. We've had that particular rule in the configuration since one of the early revisions, and it doesn't scale very well.

I left the exact number of reports unspecified an a small measure against it, but ultimately it has forced us into a position where it needs to be updated, and that's a good thing. I'll also go over other parts of the config to update them while I'm at it.
    I would love to hear some of those reports. I did get PM's about some of them :).
        PMed a summary of them.
            Cheers! :)

I'm using Slide at the moment (seriously good reddit app), but it doesn't have the mod log. It does have mod mail and the mod queue though (and most of the other stuff too). 

I haven't tried the other apps on the store recently, but Slide was the first one to get good mod tools (iirc). Props to /u/ccrama for their hard work.
    Thank you very much, glad you're liking Slide :)

And I actually forgot modlog was a thing, I'll make sure to add that into the next update!

                Just about every CS:GO cheater and their mother claims that they didn't do anything when they get VAC banned, so they always go on steam support and various forums looking to get their VAC ban reversed (which is impossible, thankfully)

    Or they took the advice of others and actually have it a shot. Then realized their initial feeling was true

Then there are those who didn't read up on it and thought it was multiplayer. Then got several hours into the game and realized it doesn't exist
    [deleted]
        Well, to be honest, that sounds right about any game with a sense of completing stuff (campaigns, side missions, gear upgrades, etc.), but for a game like No Man's Sky, that people where promised it would be an infinite universe with infinite animals/landscapes variety and many many things to do ("you can do anything", quoting SM), people might've invested these 20-30 hours trying to find out what to do and what is there that they're missing and simply come to a conclusion that it's pointless to continue doing so. 
My main beef is that they are still falsely advertising stuff in the game (dune worm, etc) in the trailers on the steam store. It's been more than 2 weeks since PC release.
Ya, I totally get that a lot of people feel really lied to but honestly I avoided most of the promo material from a long time out, so the game was more of a mystery to me. I went in expecting to be able to explore galaxies and stuff. I honestly think the game will be a lot more playable for me as they add a larger pallets of both flora and fauna.  

Had I followed all the hype and promos I would likely be pretty mad, but archeage taught me its generally best to ignore all that shit because in the end it's meaningless. 
Ya see if I put 40+ hours into a game that's not an MMO I feel like I have lost all right to complain about refunds or not enjoying it. Clearly I enjoyed it and clearly I got my money's worth. But I appreciate that not everyone views it the same way. 
This post was initially fully downvoted and removed by a mod. I appealed to have it reinstated. He posted that when that was going on.
    I still think it's laughable to act like having a critical opinion of the game is somehow taboo or shunned here when it's been the majority of the front page discussion, memes and the like since release.
Kinda fun to see that every time, like dude is calling someone an idiot for loving/supporting the game and wen he gets downvoted complain that he has a brigade against him cause he's at -2, and they he gets upvoted to +120. What's wrong with that sub lol.
    * Claim to hate Sean for lying to get people to like the game
* Lie about what's not in the game to get people to hate it

Sums up a lot of this sub's attitude since release.

Even lying by omission. Like the Big Things mod. *Horrific* pop in on medium devices but yeh let's stay silent when people bitch about it not being in the vanilla game. Convenient that they're all screenshots or a video of walking on the ground.

>Shhh, don't disturb their hate-fueled narrative.

It's the shadowy cabal known as /r/gamingcirclejerk. 

In a world controlled by """Sean Apologists""" where any reasonable criticism is automatically downvoted (and definitely not upvoted into the stratosphere and gilded fifty times, no siree) one small band of brave gamers is here to tell the hard truths the hordes of deluded fanboys need to hear - at serious risk to themselves and their livelihoods. Starring Redditors and their famed persecution complex.

I agree entirely.  However, I don't like seeing games making millions of dollars from hype based on almost entirely false promises.  So regardless of whether or not people should have known better, I'm happy to see them getting refunds.
NMS straight up didnt work on release. AK ran at about 30 fps for me on launch, but NMS wouldnt even start most times.
Like every movement, each side has their extremists. On one hand, you have a few people who think No Man's Sky players are idiots. On the other, you have a few rabid fanboys who can't find any flaws with the game and will put down any dissension. I personally like the game and have been having fun with it, but it isn't without its flaws. 
Also it appears more likely to go through if you choose steam wallet.

It's a testament to how amazing our support team is that refunds are even working at all.

Edit: Thanks to the anonymous redditor for my first gold :)
I had no problem with him until he said the game was a 9 out of 10. That was straight up misleading at a time when no one else had reviewed it.
Not everyone understands other's hobbies. For example,  people get pissed if you buy a console/mac/Alianware, as they see it as wasting money. They're not jealous, they're just unable to understand why someone would ever do it.

daymeeuhn was probably the only reasonable person in the NMS community, and yet he still got shit on by fanbois just for giving his honest opinion of the game. He said the universe was bland and it didn't get crazier as he reached the center of the galaxy, etc. Everyone just kept shouting at him, saying he had a preview copy of the game, and that release would change everything, etc.

He was calm in his responses and he gave pretty much the same review that everyone else did. He talked about how much the game crashed, and some of the other bugs he encountered. He said that the game should have been beta tested. Etc.

Basically, everything that the community needed to know about NMS was covered by his posts, several days before official release. Instead of listening to him, and putting the breaks on the hype-train, the community just yelled at him for posting 'spoilers' and they went full-steam-ahead into this disaster. 

It's kinda funny looking back at it now. Everyone was so afraid of spoilers, but there really wasn't anything to spoil. 
They will care when they make more terrible purchases like that and then wonder where the fuck their money went.
Oh man, you'd have a field day with the mods on the Steam forums.
Looking at you r/politics. 
    Mod removes article with 4000 upvotes: 'Title not exact match'

Turns out it was a missing period


        Don't like that rule. What if the title of the article is misleading, inflammatory, or clickbaity? 
    Also r/news
    I think /r/politics is just pretending to be like /r/totallynotrobots 
        /r/politics caught the infection /r/politicaldiscussion got from /r/hillaryclinton, which was a lab brewed money virus that attacks facts related to Hillary Clinton while upvoting inflammitory antiTrump stuff. Did you know Trump is a jack ass? Go to /r/politics for all the latest specifics on that if you haven't gotten the jist by now.

Just don't mention Clinton in a negative way.
that's what happens when you give some power to frustrated internet kids
    I shudder to think how many mods of subs with 40,000+ subscribers are children. 
        To give you a little insight on that, whenever a video game gets announced, a sub is created within minutes for that game.

Anyone, and everyone can become a mod, it's just whoever the fuck gets there first.
/r/nfl is removing all posts about Colin Kaepernick protesting during the national anthem
Subreddits such as this one are also more recently prone to clickbait posts because you can get karma from self posts now
7 seems low for a sub with this many people 
    Subs get spammed a lot by bots. Most spam filters catch this, but sometimes you don't really want 20 people to have to see something before it gets flagged. It doesn't delete the post, it's just removes it until a live-mod can look at it. As this subreddit only has 12 mods and over 160k subs (with many MANY angry subs), it seems more than reasonable to allow the bot to flag and remove as quickly as possible, as it's better to have 1 mistaken good post than 10 shit spam posts. 
This actually explains a great deal.
Not so much. 14 hours in 2 days. No refund.  
Hah!  Indeed.  The point system means that the majority of the most opinionated people who read it agree strongly with it or disagree strongly with the opposite of what it seems to be saying.
Just once I would love to visit a sub with pop-up text over the downvote arrow that says "This is a disagree button."
It depends on the sub, honestly. r/TheSilphRoad had to crack down on shitposts to make it what it is today - when it was initially just r/PokemonGo with a bit of a superiority complex. It's not removing posts because "I don't like it", but because the posts don't belong in the subreddit based on the rules and spirit of the sub.

Of course, whenever the rules aren't explicitly black and white, disagreements will arise. It's on the mods to enforce gray-area rules from the perspective of the spirit of the subreddit, which is hard sometimes. For example, r/baseball is obviously a subreddit for fans of baseball, but we've had to add a rule restricting posts about player performances because people were beginning to post about entirely uneventful things. When deciding whether those posts should stay or go, I have to look beyond my own biases and fandom and determine whether the event is noteworthy in the eyes of the community. And sometimes I'm sure I'll get it wrong - I might remove something that would've been fairly well received, and I might leave a post that gets downvoted and ignored. But if the mods approach it from the perspective of the subreddit instead of themselves, it would work considerably better.
    /r/baseball mod! My fav sub. Go Cubs Go!
> And the community handles it fine with the voting system.

Or a handful of people can literally take over a sub simply by hovering the new section. See: r/leagueoflegends/ for a while.

++
    This.  A small group, working together can pretty manipulate things on the front page on a lot of forums.  And even on the larger groups with a sympathetic (knowingly or unknowingly) mod, the same can happen.  By the very nature of the voting system and how the individual forum front pages work.
The overwhelmingly most common incentive anyone seems to want to be a mod on Reddit is to inject themselves as a middle man between users and the voting system. Otherwise it's just volunteer service. The sort of people who rightfully see it as such and do it anyway as a good will to a community need more pats on the back. 
    Kind of like politicians.  The ones who want the job are the ones that shouldn't have the job.  
    I became a mod to be a CSS bitch and ride the hype of giving people flairs and designing a pretty subreddit. Now I'm a CSS bitch majorly ignored by the community
        Which kind of means you're doing your job well.  When the community notices you too much, as a mod, it's generally a bad thing.  Now your work on the other hand, hopefully they appreciate that, even if folks generally are quieter when satisfied than they are when the opposite is true.
            When people wanted cat flairs I got daily messages for like a month. I finally broke after a mod mail, got off my ass, and made a ton of silly ones. You can see the result on the subreddit.
>A strong subreddit lets the voting system handle the posts.

Not true.  Otherwise you end up with /r/gaming shitposts all the time.

Over on /r/XboxOne and /r/ps4, we have rules to keep content relatively high quality.  No memes, reaction gifs, or shit in general.

That said, I'd never remove a post if it didn't break any rules simply because it had low karma.
Then you haven't had to deal with STEAM customer service, there's a very real difference that can be felt between physical item customer service and digital.

STEAM operate on a "work where you want" policy, and the majority of STEAM employees refuse to work customer service. It's their most undermanned department and Valve are ok with that. They will make you work for your money.
    Except this is a special case. As with Batman before it, they are extending their return policy to anyone that had the game regardless of playtime. There is no caveat, no asterisk. If you own it and want a refund you can have one. It's far different when dealing with normal Steam returns where, in order to even apply for a refund you have to have less than two hours of playtime and even then it's hardly guaranteed.
        It's not an automatic thing. I have asked for a refund three times now and still getting denied. I'll keep doing it until I get it, and I thank /u/TheMuteness for his advice
I suppose it's the person you talk to that ultimately decides.
    It makes sense that they have no protocol for this, I don't blame them.
https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php
    It still makes me click a bunch of stuff and leads me to the normal refund page where I request an automated one and get rejected... how do you actually get in touch with anybody at steam?
        Here is what I did.

Step 1 

What type of problem are you having?

: Purchases and Payments (dropdown 1)
 
: Refunds (dropdown 2)

Step 2

Is the problem with Steam or with a game on Steam?

: Game or software on Steam (button)

: No Man's Sky (game name textfield)

Step 3

This is where you submit your ticket. 
            thanks man I'll try it out!! 
            What should the question and text be? I'm not sure
            I still get refused. I'll try again, both ways
    Thanks!
https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php
It can be, if we work together. 
    I'll be your copilot anytime.
        I appreciate the sentiment, but that feature wasn't implemented. 
We're implementing a scanner to make it easier to get your refund. We definitely want to encourage this kind of thing. 
I so badly want to create screenshot threads of the refund process and talk about how gorgeous they are. But I'd be downvoted, banned, and probably have a nasty Vice article written about me. 
Keep in mind that that also includes all new players as the game keeps going.

The vast majority of players are playing NMS for a day or two and then saying "Fuck this shit" and never touching it again.


My mind is blown!
If even just 1% of you keep playing, that's still so many people!
    I'm sad the about 99.99% of ~~planets~~ copies will never be discovered
You know what the worst part is? There have been SEVEN patches on the PS4 and every single patch just says 'bug fixes'.

They COULD put patch notes, details, whatever they want in there. They choose to just say bug fixes.

If I could return a PS4 game I would definitely return this game.
    The lack of communication and transparency is the most damning thing for me. It's seriously not that hard. 
        it's not even lack of communication anymore.

it's pure ignorance - because there is no communication at all.
    Are we 100% sure Hello Games and Niantic are not the same company?

I bought a copy of the local newspaper cause there was an article about the game and the first impressions of the article writer in there, and I want to get the cost of the newspaper refunded.
Use the words false advertising
You have to keep opening tickets, sort of pestering them. A few people it took 10+ times to finally get a refund, some took just a couple times, and some on the first try. Just keep trying and you will get it. 
    In my headcanon there is literally one rogue support guy that had too high expectations and refunds everybody :D

How many times did Molyneux do it to us? People have short memories.
    He already had an established reputation though, this was these guys' first time being on this scale.
        It should also be mentioned that Fable was still a good game, however not what we expected.
    Molyneux's games weren't actually mediocre like NMS though. Now I just said like an apologist. Murray outright lied whilst Molyneux doesn't understand what a limitation is.
People get emotionally invested in things they buy or enjoy. They feel like other people not enjoying it is a slight against them personally. They want their opinion to be enforced by the fact that others also enjoy the same thing, reaffirming their belief that it was a good decision to buy it or that they're right to enjoy it. I personally don't understand that mindset because if you enjoy something, that should be enough on its own regardless of what others think. I mean, sure, I used to act like that, about music I liked/ didn't like... but that was when I was like 14 or 15, and childish. 
It is mindboggling he is allowed to continue modding. The whole point of reddit is gone with behaviour like this. 

Imagine if Microsoft had nestled people into the mod team of /r/windows10...
I would love to hear some of those reports. I did get PM's about some of them :).

    Sorry, but VAC bans are permanent.
        I'll have to be honest with ya, not getting the joke. 
            Just about every CS:GO cheater and their mother claims that they didn't do anything when they get VAC banned, so they always go on steam support and various forums looking to get their VAC ban reversed (which is impossible, thankfully)

Would you like to know more?
                I'm not allowed to have my own cell phone so my dad forced me to use his phone number.

Hello I'm the father and what my son says is true, he did not cheat, it was his brother on my account. Please unban him valve

Or they took the advice of others and actually have it a shot. Then realized their initial feeling was true

Then there are those who didn't read up on it and thought it was multiplayer. Then got several hours into the game and realized it doesn't exist

    Well, to be honest, that sounds right about any game with a sense of completing stuff (campaigns, side missions, gear upgrades, etc.), but for a game like No Man's Sky, that people where promised it would be an infinite universe with infinite animals/landscapes variety and many many things to do ("you can do anything", quoting SM), people might've invested these 20-30 hours trying to find out what to do and what is there that they're missing and simply come to a conclusion that it's pointless to continue doing so. 
I still think it's laughable to act like having a critical opinion of the game is somehow taboo or shunned here when it's been the majority of the front page discussion, memes and the like since release.
* Claim to hate Sean for lying to get people to like the game
* Lie about what's not in the game to get people to hate it

Sums up a lot of this sub's attitude since release.

Even lying by omission. Like the Big Things mod. *Horrific* pop in on medium devices but yeh let's stay silent when people bitch about it not being in the vanilla game. Convenient that they're all screenshots or a video of walking on the ground.
*Get one Dowvote* "Help! I'm being oppressed!"

Believe me, nothing makes me happier than to see this news. There's officially no reason for those dissatisfied with the PC release to remain. Happy trails.

I was so mad at the start of this comment.
I'm not allowed to have my own cell phone so my dad forced me to use his phone number. My dad has a steam too and uses the same number. today my brother used my dads account and cheated and now my main account is VAC banned. It's true and here is proof, my father will now write too:

Hello I'm the father and what my son says is true, he did not cheat, it was his brother on my account. Please unban him valve

sincerely the father


Pls unban
    I thought this was a real story, untill the end. hahahha.
Please tell me that was a Starship Troopers reference
