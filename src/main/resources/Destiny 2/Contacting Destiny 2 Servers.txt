[[Contacting Destiny 2 Servers]]





I was in the middle of playing, and the game kicked me to tell me servers were at capacity.
    Same here I was playing my second strike and got kicked
        Jealous you were able to get into a second strike. I had to solo the first one. It would not match me with anyone. Figured the server issues were affecting matchmaking.
            Oh wow yeah I guess I got lucky
            That was happening to me... Like two weeks ago.
            Could it be related to your match filters? You can set it to only allow friends or clan members, or public, or none.
        Second strike? I got to do the intro and disconnected while talking to Eris on the moon... Then got stuck in a queue to join so I gave up after 30 minutes or waiting. I'm still hyped to play. I kinda expected stuff like this day 1.
    Same here and near the end of the first mission.
    Same here, now I'm 11941 in queue.
    It was prolly the emergency maintenance starting tbf
    So there is a new type of enemy
    I had just finished a Public Event on Earth when I got the boot. :(
    So its happening to others?
Just got the game for free and for some damn reason i cant get past the prologue
Truer words were never spoken.
    I‚Äôm more surprised that it‚Äôs only in the 10s of thousands in terms of the queue
        A lot of people are probably still at their jobs.
            I have no Internet because my Internetprovider is an asshole. So I havent started playing shadowkeep yet.
                Lol no worries, you can‚Äôt get in anyways
                hell yea
                Just like everyone else haha
                Jokes on you, even if you had it you'd have to wait 3 hours to play for an hour to get dunked on by a warsat so hard that destiny's servers kick you out.
                Same my internet went out right as I logged in and hit the tower. I rang my service provider who assured me it would be fixed within an hour. 12 hours later it‚Äôs still down üò§
                What's your ISP?
            This. Waiting for my oldest to get home so we can hop back on. We did get to the Moon though for 20 minutes.
            Like me):
                same lmao, luckily with the server issues there's no spoilers
            Can confirm, currently at work and getting ready to wait for a queue time at 5
            Yeah I‚Äôm at work.
            I played a little before but then got kicked off the servers, put in a que of 21000 and just gave up and went to work.
                I had a pretty good experience with it last night, I wasn‚Äôt able to play until around 8pm but after that I had zero errors and was never kicked from my session, only played about 2 or so hours though.
        Speak for yourself.... I'm at 21661
            Well hello neighbor I‚Äôm 21663
                Suckers! I'm at 15713 and I have been for an hour and a half!
                    Not no more. Servers are down to fix the issue. What you're seeing isnt right
                        They saved my place! I've been told the servers were down about 6 times now and every time I try again I have the same number!!!


/s
                            No. Like they shit down destiny 1 and 2 for a major server update. Bungie is completely down. No one on this planet is playing right now. They said itll be up in awhile
                                Sarcasm man, sarcasm. Either you are playing along beautifully or I'm too convincing.
                                    Why not both
                    I have been at 381 for 45 minutes. I think people are cutting in line ahead of me.
                        I logged in at 11.5k in line at around 6pm central. Dropped to like 1k something after 5 minutes got booted. I logged in again and within like 3 minutes of "contacting destiny servers popping up on the bottom successfully started playing.
                    I‚Äôve been at 1674
                I got kicked from the queue
                    Me too  snow I can‚Äôt login lol.

Edit becAuse I‚Äôm a skimmer and apparently there is maintenance.
                29953
                20737 here
            I was at 4743. Then I somehow jumped to 27548
                I think the servers are down now.
                    Yes they‚Äôre down now. Emergency maintenance
                        Finally
                            Their twitter posted about it. 

[twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/BungieHelp)
                    Yeah they had to do an emergency service of servers as we speak
                I don‚Äôt feel so bad lmao I‚Äôve been 8234 in place for 3 hours until the servers went down
            bruh i‚Äôm at 27001
            Which is still squarely in the "tens of thousands"...
            I was at 1610 for over an hour. My position never changed
            Hey, I got down to 2500. The character selection screen appeared for about a quarter of a second then got booted.

Helpfully Bungie told me that I was being put back into the queue and I will join the game in the order I connected.

9860.... but the queue is going up and not down....

10745
        I'm sleeping
        i think that's because the servers are dead and thus it just grabs the most recent number. also spread over 3 platforms
        I was at 98. Then I restarted and I was at 361. Restarted again. Went to 870 ish, now I'm at 2050. It never goes down. But after 20 mins I restart and it goes up a few hundred. The numbers are BS
    Lol thank you
        Didn't Bungie post this in their post on the official subreddit?
            Yea I made it and someone put it on Twitter and bungie made it the megathread banner for Destiny The Game

    That's strange everything should be 750 no matter what.
        [removed]
            You may just need to unequip and reequip gear when you get back online
                That wont work. My 10 LL gear is not 750. I equip all my low lvl gear and am able to get to 27 LL
        You can drop to ~150 if you had the base gear from the Red War.


My Warlock still had them for some reason, and they didn't get bumped up to 750 like all the other gear.
    You never played destiny 1 on rise if iron release did you?
        I did and it wasn't even close to this bad. You just had to wait in line basically and once you were in you were good.
            I'm lol it was bad. Maybe worse. Me and my boys were in waiting for about an hour and a half. I waited 10 minutes and I was in on shadowkeep. They are taking the servers down now to fix it though.
                I remember waiting 20 to 30 min for RoI and then it was smooth sailing for me at least. I got right in today and then nothing but contacting destiny servers the whole time until it kicked me to wait in line. Almost made it through the first mission.
                Well, I‚Äôve been trying to get in for like 4 hours now . .  . So, ‚Äúworse‚Äù for some of us.
                [deleted]
                    I been on ever since I got loaded in after a short time Haha about 9 hours now and not one single issue
                        [deleted]
        Gosh I forgot about that
    I can't even get *that* far. It's all downloaded and its still gonna take an hour to launch...
        Gotta love that "unpacking"
            Yeah I turned my PC on ready to play and had to wait an hour. Then the game is at capacity anyway...
                An hour? Im on 6 rn and not done yet. My internet is fine, just steam being useless
                    It's based on your HDD speed, nothing to do with internet. I'm running an SSD which unpacked it at 30MB/s.
                        Im not sure, I only say that because I downlaoded shadow of mordor fine, and other launchers work fine with no speed issues
                            Your disk could be fragmented quite a bit. Try running windows defrag, should help alot. You also could just be running low on space.
                I copied my bnet install into my steam folder... Didn't take long at all.
    Rise of Iron was the sameeeee way
        Not this bad. Been almost 12 hrs since launch and no one played.
            Not true. I played for 2 hours. A couple people I talked to played from the start of launch so about 4 before we got kicked.
                It‚Äôs still bad. And the reason is because they don‚Äôt have the server space; with activision behind it they had the servers but it was crap game lol.
                    Lol with Activision it was the same. They just released Shadowkeep and free to play at the same time. Also I posted that like 3 hours ago. So yeah it‚Äôs getting worse. We went live at around 1pm it‚Äôs only been about 6 hours.
                        You‚Äôre right; I‚Äôm just mad; I wanna play lol
                            Hey man, we all do. Just have to stay glass half full!
                I got a couple of hours in as well. It‚Äôs been down since around 4pm EST
                    Yup. Right when I got kicked as well EST. I‚Äôm in Michigan
    Mine said that but I noticed I didn't have a piece of gear equipped. Try checking that
    whats wierd is one of my characters isnt 750
    You would think since they had 24 hours and this happens every time they might have sorted it this time.
    I saw it when Destiny 2 first released
    Oh, be assured, this isn‚Äôt the first time in the past 5 years, but it is the most intense
    same problem here, my hunter was like lvl 3 or 4 with 190 power, still 190...  
looking at my equipment i had the same items cloned with 750 power, but my bazooka was 0 so i only reach to 650..... buuuuut doing a few open world quest reach to ip 778 easily
I was in for a couple of hours and it was beautiful.  Then contacting Destiny killed me and my ghost failed to revive me.

It‚Äôs not that bad right?
                Better than 14997
                    That's much better than 16209.
                        Rip I‚Äôm now 4105 hopefully better for you too
                            A bit. I was in once, then got booted. Left and came back I was at like 30000+, now I'm at 8767 and dropping. Fingers crossed.
                    Better than 15815
                        Where do you see your spot in line? I am gonna have to remote access to my PC on my way home to boot and wait in q
                            Shows up when you are waiting to get it.
                I got a message- severs are not responsing got kicked to back of the line.
            Lol
            6000? I'm at 17849 rn

Excuse me?
This should hopefully survive the floods of server full posts
    I tried to be positive and original. We all enjoy the game no need to yell at bungie for not being more prepared. Besides I'm glad so many players are in the game now

            Yea I think you may be right I just posted it and it's already over 50 upvotes feels good man. And thanks
                I wish they were in my games üíî
            Well you were definitely right my friend lol

        [removed]
            Ik it hurts. To be honest though I never thought this meme would blow up like it did lol. This is my first post to ever break 1k upvotes and it's on Twitter and the megathread banner on destiny the game I'm really happy right now
        I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre so welcoming. Everyone else seems to resent me trying out New Light and thinks I should be shoved off to a separate queue with all the other dirty F2P players. 

So rude! üò§
            It's a game that has a die-hard fanbase and when that base can't play they will blame any and everyone
Bungie said it's my turn to play shadowkeep!!
    Right!

They just took down D1 and D2 for emergency maintenance according to their Twitter account.
    At least they are doing something about it
        That's what the optimistic side of me is telling my pessimistic side...
    Cheers for pointing that out, saves sitting wondering wtf is happening.
Too real. I gave up and went to minecraft.
    Same I waited for like 15 mins then hopped on ESO
        Legit same. ESO is always there for me
            Yea I needed to finish leveling my stamcro anyway
        ESO? Elite Sanctuary Onslaught?

        Sorry for your terrible internet. Only took me 3 hours.
I got kicked from the game and have been sitting in "queue" for about an hour now.
    You're a better man than me I have up after 15 mins
    [removed]
        Don't give me hope
Perfect!
    Thanks
The steam community page is a mess right now over it. Steam community never fails to irritate me regardless of the game so I don‚Äôt know why I even bothered. The sad thing is this is just more ammo for people who haven‚Äôt liked the game since launch but refuse to give it another shot or acknowledge any of its improvements.
    Yea I think the servers just have to much traffic between all 3 systems
Guess the moon is not the only thing thats haunted hhahaha

 Are you kidding me? I quit my job to make sure I could get ahead of everyone. My world first team is relying on me. My wife has threatened to leave me. This couldn‚Äôt have been all for nothing. I don‚Äôt think the site will sign me again if I try to go back. This is all I have.
> Your place in queue: 11654


I guess I‚Äôll... just go outside
    Right!
    I know my phone is telling me to take a walk with how inactive I've been all day.
The sheer amount of REEEEEEEE on twitter, mah gawd, bungo, don't look at the replies.

It's aight.  Sucks for us, sucks for you, but we believe in you, you got this.
Don't you talk to me or my multinational multimillion-dollar video game and it's two servers ever again
    Lol
No they f'd up and let the free version available.  Should've waited a week or more to give paid players the opportunity to play 1st. Typical bungo
i went in to today with the intention of being one of the people that helps drag the servers down by playing. i guess it worked
    You monster lol
I'm still waiting to get in, been waiting to get home all day and I'll keep waiting to play
    I tried but I can't wait that long
        "Your place in queue: 20446" fml.
            Jeez it's really that long I thought ppl were joking
                For ps4 it is
                    That's what I play but I gave up after 15 mins
                        I'm on ps4 aswell, I'm willing to wait
                            You're a better man than me
Currently at queue 15815....menu music is just playing all through my house haha.
Suffering from Success
Hey Bungie, you're newly free of Activision and get to prove to the world what you're really made of!  Go out there and make a new first impression on your audience!

"ONE MOMENT PLEASE"
Aw man! I've been waiting all day to get home from work and play, and as soon as I do boom massive server overload and Destiny is offline! üò®
Man....took off work a week ago, got home, cracked a beer and was lucky enough to play for an hour before being kicked and have been in line for almost 2....
I EVEN BOUGHT FORSAKEN TOO REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Bungo pls.
Shadowqueueep
Paid players should have priority over freebie players. I want to check out the moon.
    Although I don‚Äôt think this is really going to be an ongoing issue and I think some people are getting a little too worked up, I agree there should be a priority queue for those that paid. It‚Äôs a pretty common thing for free-to-play games with an optional subscription or paid expansions.
"Did You buy Destiny 2 Vanilla at launch with pre-order?"  
"Yes"

"How Bungie rewarded you?"  
"Being put on line with 11k people after changing platforms like I am a free-player"
    Haha basically
game is so full i cant even link my accounts
    I don't think they're full so to speak it's just too much traffic sharing info between all 3 platforms
Not even destiny 1 is working! I‚Äôm not even getting into the game while I could play d2 for about an hour or so while getting constant ‚Äúcontacting destiny 2 server messages‚Äù.  I can‚Äôt fault bungie tho, this has been happening to me forever and everybody is on today which probably messes with the servers. Just wish I coulda got a bit done. I haven‚Äôt played d1 and wanted to finish the campaign before I played shadowkeep but again, can‚Äôt get into the game. Guess I‚Äôll just wait it out??
There have better been a fire in the server room or some shit. (No casualties preferably)
    Apparently it's fixed. Place in queue 6484
> Did You Grow The
    Lol
Can wait to slam the servers later with all my login attempts.

    Exactly how many reclaimable exotics and stockpiled Mythos Hack 2.0s do you have?
I‚Äôve been waiting for like 30 minutes
Like it literally says the servers are down. What the heck.
The Queue slot is just a random number generator.  


Change my mind.
It was a fun 25 minutes' worth of gametime before I was locked out entirely. Definitely worth the $100+ my wife and I spent on the DLC. Great times.
Suffering from Success.
When you forgot to download the game so now you don‚Äôt have to deal with that shit
is the game worth coming back to? i stopped playing after warmind
    If you're being serious then yes the game is in a far better state than at warmind. Right now it's free to hop back in.

If you were joking when asking this still funny take my upvote
I was in a Nightfall, on the final boss, then I saw my partener vanished before my eyes, one by one, until I was the only one left.

Never felt so alone in my life.
I‚Äôm a new guy

Sorry vets for taking your space, I love the game tho!
To be fair.....the games fucking good.
Ha
I paid 35 euroes for this game and i queue with these free to play bastards
    Its funny how a peer to peer game has server issues. They host NO DATA on their servers yet they have issues. Imagine if cs go in 2011 or 2012 whatever had issues with their servers. So stupid.
        I was thinking about that....how DID the "servers" actually go down if it is p2p?
            Because they do actually have servers? If you think everything is P2P there are actual login servers which are also prone to issues especially when having to deal with a huge amount of traffic like they've been dealing with today.
                oooooooooh.
            It's the login/authentication servers. Only player movement/actions is handled via P2P.
    blame stosh
What servers?
    The login and inventory servers. You didn't really think Bungie would let clients keep track of their own items and progress, did you? That's exactly how you get your game infested with hackers.
which is going to put off a lot of people who wont even try playing again
    It's unfortunate but expected since they went free to play and added cross save. The servers may not actually be full they just have to much traffic between all 3 systems if I had to guess
        The cross save page is broken rn too
My place is 14,661 in the queue apparently, any second now I'm sure.
    Lol
        Damn I‚Äôm 14997
Got in earlier and got Monte Carlo right away and Wavesplitter on Xbox. Then got bumped and haven‚Äôt been able to get in to try them. Been trying for about an hour now.
    üòí I hate you lol naw but at least you got an exotic
        Man, I can‚Äôt even get Ishtar or DIM to even recognize it so I can check it out. Lmao.
            Yea that sucks
            I'm pretty sure Ishtar and DIM have their own places in the queue - it'd probably be best if everyone kept them off for now.
    Saved an exotic engram and got Monte, feels pretty good so far
You‚Äôre place in the queue: 15434
    Right!
    Finally ahead of someone 14997
5595 baby
Moons full
Right when I fucking got home from school
How do we know it's not just general server instability? Do we have the numbers?
    Yea I honestly think it's because of crossave. The servers have too much traffic from all 3 platforms
Curently 13160 in the ps4 queue
Guessing most of the people upvoting tgis is in the queue?
    Lmao
My place is 20,673. Beat that fellow guardians! I was in earlier today before all the kiddies got out of school. Apparently I now have to wait for them to go back tomorrrow morning.....kids suck.
    25526...
    25,635 here buddy. Ffs
You guys broke the damn game already. Great job!
You aint lying LMAO I couldn't even dismantle old stuff
As is tradition with every big Destiny event send the beginning of time.
Currently trying to load in as we speak
Bro I'm in a que of 19,609 people rn fml I wanna get on Chad o'keefe
Tru
I was #19754 in the queue on Xbox. Guess I'll be watching Hulu...
Lol I figured it would be like this.
In place 24001...... glad I pre-ordered and woke early..... wonder how long "Destiny 2 is currently at capacity" will fuck my gaming time.....
    Lol it shouldn‚Äôt be a shock that the servers are having trouble on launch day
        True, but never seen it (or any game) this bad before...
26,235th place and holding strong..
I'm grateful that I even got in, but the servers are so full that I kept contacting servers and getting kicked to orbit. What I did was fun, though!
is it worth trying to jump on today?
(new player here) yeah I expected this , I think everyone did , even the developers
As I read this I am 24008 in the queue.
Would be nice if I could actually play üôÑüôÑ
Servers haunted
Glad I'm still installing /shrug
Steam says there's 104,938 ppl playing D2 right now. Wut.
I was in the middle of a mission for shadowkeep when I got booted and put into the queue... Currently at 26272.
    How do you see what number you are?
        It pops up after awhile. It just showed "you will join the game in the order that you connected" for a long time. Eventually a number will pop up below that
How long till they come back on
Wait what?  What did they do.  I haven‚Äôt played since forsaken (time constraints)
    Servers got taken down since base game is free to play and too many ppl flooded the servers crashing them
Nothing to do with player base lol; it‚Äôs crappy planning and not setting up ELB
    Eh I think it's a combination of crossave flooding the servers with too much traffic, general increase since base game is free, and improper planning
        True true; they should do a priority. If you bought Shadowkeep you get in before F2P
I hope the new light players are enjoying the game, while i sit here on my phone looking at the full capacity screen
I'm number 10784, so feeling good about playing around the time when the sun dies.
How long do you guys think we will have to wait?
They could have released new light a week after Shadow keep. I'm so tilted rn.
I was placed in 9520. The wait time, I was having so much fun.
r/blizzard laughs
Heh I‚Äôm at 8,392
Jeez man I hadn't been able to play without being stopped or being able to got to the tower for like at least 2 hours
This is a little outrageous bungie. How the he'll do you not prepare for this??? People took off work for your stupid game...what a mistake. Cant even play yet again cuz again you fail at launch
    This isn't exclusive to Bungie.
Heck yea

5 bloody hours I been waiting can't believe this shit. I'm mad as hell. I demand compensation
Nearly got 4 hours solid play in before getting kicked off. Well worth getting up at 3am!
Guess having shit speed limiting until the 3rd isnt too bad...
My brother and I are currently waiting in queue as of now. XD
Ugh. Was 317, then kicked and now 14299...at least I got to play for a couple hours before was kicked to the cue fiasco.
Is the queue supposed to go down at all while you wait?
I've been trying to transfer my account for 3 days now
Got to play if a bit before had to quit and restart again.. Was at no 10625 or something in line will play later now no use staying up
Just tried to hop on, I didn‚Äôt even get the DLC cause no money so I‚Äôm not worried about taking a spot. Game on Guardians.
Currently 19180 in front of me
How do I keep getting pushed further in the queue? Start out at 24,189 and now and 24,444. Wish my bank account did that.

Bravo Bungie
I'm currently 27000th in the queue!
Got to play for a hour, error coded out, been in a 4 hour que so far.
Nice, bungo r using ur meme
    You mean on the megathread?
        Yeah
            Ok I was wondering how it got there because I thought you couldn't post pics in destiny the game. Wait so that means bungie themselves added it üò≥
                Yessir, your meme made it
                    Holy crap (shaxx voice) "THIS IS AMAZING"
i havent played destiny since the first one released.  what happened? i keep hearing that bungie doesnt have enough server space? what are the details here?
Are people getting in at all? I'm at 899 and dont wanna get my Hope's up when its close
    Servers got taken offload be for both D1 and D2 and no eta on when they will be brought back online
        I'm in!!!
Really?! Damn, I was looking forward to playing the moment I got home later today. Is it really that bad or can you still connect after some waiting?
    https://mobile.twitter.com/bungiehelp/with_replies
        Ty! Will keep and eye on it.
    Servers are all down for "emergency maintenance" right now. No one is playing.
I have seen this message more than the kids MY BITCH EX WIFE TOOK FROM ME
    Use your new  finishing move on her.
BUT WAIT!? I THOUGHT DESTINY SERVERS WERE P2P? YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT THERE IS SOMETHING ACTUALLY WRONG WITH THEM!? WHAAAAA??? NOOOO!
All I can think about is that vine where the guy screaming "I have any coupon for two free tacos "
So good!
Oh god, I couldn‚Äôt even log in, gonna play it tmw, Friday and Sunday like I‚Äôm a insane person
I kept disconnecting but finally got in after 2+ hours
Lol with Activision it was the same. They just released Shadow Keep and free to play at the same time. Also I posted that like 3 hours ago. So yeah it‚Äôs getting worse. We went live at around 1pm it‚Äôs only been about 6 hours.
went from 10462 to 564 to 14679 to 15363 in the queue
I didn't do one of those laughs where you push air out of your nose, I legit laughed out loud. This is a great meme!
    Thank you bungie, Twitter, and many here do to. I'm glad I brought joy to your day
Sitting in que and numbers start to go down then climb back up
I'm in party chat with a buddy who is playing right now. Says the tower he is in is full.

Meanwhile the BungieHelp Twitter hasn't tweeted anything in over an hour.
    So the servers are on? What system are you on?
        We're both on the Xbox but I'm still stuck at a que along with the 3rd guy in our party.

Edit: just got in! I'm gong to the moon boys!
            Lucky you I'm glad you got in enjoy
I was In for two hours had like 100 contacting messages and then was booted and put in queue, bla bla bla crota Gary fanatic, darkness ship under the keep, two tailed fox, and exotic mission from banshee
The moment when you see you're at 773, close your eyes for 2 minutes it becomes 22773
Honestly I just gave up. Imma just wait till tomorrow.
I can't even sign into bungie to use cross save to transfer my characters. They really underestimated how many new players they would get for going free to play. I love it lol.
I‚Äôm literally just going fucking up in the queue
[deleted]
    Destiny doesn't have dedicated servers and with all the crossplay peer to peer connection is out of wack and the servers probably have to much traffic coming and going
        [deleted]
            It's not so much that it's easy or hard but think of it this way a highway normally has 2 Lanes on each side per platform (PC, Xbox, PS4) now imagine the traffic from all is on the same highway but ppl keep getting on and off no turn signal. It is backed up and can't keep traffic moving
Why did Destiny F2P and the new Apex map have to launch on the same day
Almost there... only 992
Should be it cost them their existing player base
Just going to wait until tomorrow to play. That is, if they have all of this worked out. I don‚Äôt want to start playing and then get kicked off in the middle of a mission
    Yea that is the worst
What did they expect they released a big expansion and made part of the game free to play at the exact same time
Anyone else checking back and being HIGHER in the queue?

&#x200B;

I've been shoved back 2,000 spots in total, now.
Well I am in class for another 2 hours so maybe it will be good once I get home. No wonder my companion has bee broke as well
I got bumped to 7,986 from 112?!?!

NANI?!?
    i went from 4700 to immediate login
I was playing for maybe 30 minutes, got kicked, and have been in the queue for almost 4 hours now. Still in the 63rd spot and it literally hasn‚Äôt changed the whole time:(
DAMN IT I waited 4 hours to get in and was in for 5 minutes before I got kicked and have to wait again!!! Fix your shit! I‚Äôve been patient and understanding but this is ridiculous
I think it‚Äôs fixed
    Any word from bungie?
No but when I loaded the game back up I was in instantly
Looks like I need to get back into destiny
Oh, this is REALLY rich.  

Not only was I #11239 in the queue, but apparently you need to keep showing signs of activity of else you'll get booted for inactivity... which, when I logged on again, I found out I was now at frigging #15000+!

C'mon Bungie, you knew this day was gonna be huge, why weren't you ready for the F2P Steam hordes?!
Is anyone actually getting online?
So wait. Can I move my Xbox acct to pc now?
    Yes
    Yeah but you have to by it for pc though which is annoying.
        Got it in a humble bundle. Hope there are some easy step by step instructions
I'm lowkey happy that the servers are getting assfucked, because now nobody can ever say that d2 is dead
How long should I shelve the game till it's in a playable state again? It seems like Bungie totally underestimated the sheer amount of people who wanted to play this game so would putting it up for like a week for them to fix their servers be good or?
Well, I'll say one thing.  I got in earlier and wasn't really impressed.  Tried to get in later with a 16k queue.  As someone that was only mildly interested, this pushed me away.  They should have easily known this would be an issue.  No idea why this always happens with online games that have any measure of popularity and open on a popular platform.
What a great new era.
Fkn for real..

5528 in queue.

AKA....im not playing tonight.

...Probably never.
Trying to launch moon mission, returned to orbit 4 times before it worked. The struggle
Been at 3217 since 2pm. It is 8:30.
Holy shit! I'm fucking in boys!!
Can someone tell me what is going on? I have Destiny 2 but i bought no expansions. Is there new free content for someone like me?
    Base game is free to play for everyone
    Base game and first two expansions are free.
That‚Äôs crazy that people still play this when you have borderlands three
And a Dinklage sacrifice
    Its a substitute til we get dlc
I had this problem
We had to wait in line to get on. lol
It should be working now, I'm able to get in
It's OK, for the 50 quid they took I got to watch a swirly hexagon and a random number generator going up and down for a few hours.

As compensation maybe I'll get a skin for edge transit.

On the plus side I eventually got in and revelled in the moon nostalgia until I realised I've paid 50 quid for part of destiny 1 with a lick of paint.
I bought Shadowkeep regular edition and pre ordered but didn‚Äôt get two tailed fox and it says I don‚Äôt own season pass? I thought as long as you owned Shadowkeep you go season pass for undying
#Moon‚Äôs stuck.
[deleted]
    I am the original creator https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1179142336820867072
I made I down to 100 on the q then it bumped me back up to 1000
It‚Äôs live!!
Not to mention only one fucking glory playlist. And matchmaking will still out you into a match down 1 man from the very fucking start. Shadowkeep will need some really fucking quick patches. Or I may have to finslly leave destiny.
    Oh no you‚Äôre finally gonna leave destiny after five years
        I didnt say it was a threat that I would leave or it would be a deal breaker for bungie you dumbass. There are a ton of other games and matchmaking and item buffs/debuffs are in a constant state of wack. So if i want to play another game its not me saying I'm superior. Just that it may be time to move on. So stop being a jackass
            Kthnxbye
I wasn‚Äôt able to get on at all today lol
Lol again. I didnt say I AM leaving. Just that it makes me consider it. So stop assuming you know everything. Youre a real piece of work einstein
[deleted]
    No you can play all the old content for free. You only need to buy shadow keep.
Forgot avout Shadowkeep :( guess i gotta buy it later now lol
I tried playing, but every time i get to the character screen and choose one i get the ‚Äúweasel‚Äù error code, this is after the servers crashed and they fixed it. Im on steam btw.
I got on after not playing since the first raid and I have no idea what I should keep and what I should be doing.
I only got disconnected three times over like 3 hours. Guess I'm one of the lucky ones.
I was 32233 before I had to give up (work). Will try again tonight
Why couldn't they wait with newlight for a week so vets can get ready for the raid
Tuesday, steam server maintenance day. That's one of reasons I didn't even try to get online.
It took me 14 tries to load into the tower. After 5 minutes it kicked me anyway.
True story bro :)
The servers were litteraly at capacity and still I had to solo the first strike completely.
After 2 years, will we finally get a new top post of all time? Leaving my comment on this historical moment. 16.8k, 2 more to go
And the campaign
Of the 120 min ‚Äúonline‚Äù, I could only play two strikes.. that‚Äôs it.
POP goes the weasel!
I don't play destiny, but did it become f2p or something? My popular section of reddit wont stfu about Destiny 2 getting more players.
I was in position 19 for like an hour and then suddenly 22165
I think I‚Äôm the first person to get the ace of spades catalyst I got it 10 minutes from the game the opening
This is pretty normal, it's basically a re release of destiny with way more players. Was already expecting overpopulation.
You guys where lucky to get in at all. I couldn't get in
Still waiting...
The free to play should have launched the day or week after...
So are Shadowkeep and the free2play game still on the same servers ?
    I believe so yes. But I think it's also due to crossplay  flooding the servers with traffic from all 3 platforms
Servers Haunted
    Bungie‚Äôs Haunted
Yesterday i couldn't even log in, but today i had luck. I could log in every time and get kicked out the first second that I closed rhe menu. Plus side is that it looks really cool with your sparrow in the back XD
    I just wanna play so I can get that new exotic void rocket launcher
        I just wanna see the changes and maybe a quick crucible game. X`D
I couldnt even get in the Tower
I blame a YouTuber named the Camping Rusher from making it impossible to log in due to his "Rushers" swarming our beloved server.
When you grow your player base to fast and don‚Äôt realize you succeeded more than expected-bungie
I‚Äôm surprised this hasn‚Äôt received platinum yet at the time of this comment.
For those who don‚Äôt realize, this is a very good thing. The game is back baby
Suffering from success
Guess I'm 'lucky' it took all night to download - and then got back on and finished the dl this morning.

See how the servers are tonight, haven't played since Vanilla D2, see if I delete/redo all chars or something /shrug
Ah, been playing too much Warframe ma fault
Yup
"17,000 players ahead of us Jimmy!"

"Mom you're not helping!"
    Lmao
im a proud new player. Having a blast and intent to remain for a long long time. No returning back to warframe.
    Welcome guardian we are glad to have you
What‚Äôs the best way to level up in this game and should I join a clan/squad?
    Play the story and only infuse into gear you think has good rolls. You won't need a clan but they do give rewards for being in one. Until you're 900 power you can play whatever you want
    Just play.    Everything is powerful until you hit 900

Yes.  There are bonus bounties and drops fro
Being in a clan
The game is so laggy now it‚Äôs rediculiouse....
Hey that rhymes
I had 27,000 in queue at one point and that was just xbox.
I have never played any destiny game until I bought it this morning. The shadowkeep looked really cool and I‚Äôm not really playing anything else at the moment so I figured what the hell.
    It's a great game especially with all the new additions they've made
I loved the early Halo games so I always wanted to try destiny but just never quite got there.
    We're welcomed to have you guardian
üòéüëç
Digging this game :)
Quran it took me an hour and a quarter to load in
Perfectly balanced.
I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs this thing called ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù, which is just computers you can rent.  In case, y‚Äôknow, yours are full.
God I fucking love destiny
[deleted]
    Oof I'm so sorry for his loss
Good I thought that was just me
 rub
Story of my life.
Same here I was playing my second strike and got kicked
    Jealous you were able to get into a second strike. I had to solo the first one. It would not match me with anyone. Figured the server issues were affecting matchmaking.
        Oh wow yeah I guess I got lucky
        That was happening to me... Like two weeks ago.
        Could it be related to your match filters? You can set it to only allow friends or clan members, or public, or none.
    Second strike? I got to do the intro and disconnected while talking to Eris on the moon... Then got stuck in a queue to join so I gave up after 30 minutes or waiting. I'm still hyped to play. I kinda expected stuff like this day 1.
Same here and near the end of the first mission.
Same here, now I'm 11941 in queue.
It was prolly the emergency maintenance starting tbf
So there is a new type of enemy
I had just finished a Public Event on Earth when I got the boot. :(
So its happening to others?
Just got the game for free and for some damn reason i cant get past the prologue
I‚Äôm more surprised that it‚Äôs only in the 10s of thousands in terms of the queue
    A lot of people are probably still at their jobs.
        I have no Internet because my Internetprovider is an asshole. So I havent started playing shadowkeep yet.
            Lol no worries, you can‚Äôt get in anyways
            hell yea
            Just like everyone else haha
            Jokes on you, even if you had it you'd have to wait 3 hours to play for an hour to get dunked on by a warsat so hard that destiny's servers kick you out.
            Same my internet went out right as I logged in and hit the tower. I rang my service provider who assured me it would be fixed within an hour. 12 hours later it‚Äôs still down üò§
            What's your ISP?
        This. Waiting for my oldest to get home so we can hop back on. We did get to the Moon though for 20 minutes.
        Like me):
            same lmao, luckily with the server issues there's no spoilers
        Can confirm, currently at work and getting ready to wait for a queue time at 5
        Yeah I‚Äôm at work.
        I played a little before but then got kicked off the servers, put in a que of 21000 and just gave up and went to work.
            I had a pretty good experience with it last night, I wasn‚Äôt able to play until around 8pm but after that I had zero errors and was never kicked from my session, only played about 2 or so hours though.
    Speak for yourself.... I'm at 21661
        Well hello neighbor I‚Äôm 21663
            Suckers! I'm at 15713 and I have been for an hour and a half!
                Not no more. Servers are down to fix the issue. What you're seeing isnt right
                    They saved my place! I've been told the servers were down about 6 times now and every time I try again I have the same number!!!


/s
                        No. Like they shit down destiny 1 and 2 for a major server update. Bungie is completely down. No one on this planet is playing right now. They said itll be up in awhile
                            Sarcasm man, sarcasm. Either you are playing along beautifully or I'm too convincing.
                                Why not both
                I have been at 381 for 45 minutes. I think people are cutting in line ahead of me.
                    I logged in at 11.5k in line at around 6pm central. Dropped to like 1k something after 5 minutes got booted. I logged in again and within like 3 minutes of "contacting destiny servers popping up on the bottom successfully started playing.
                I‚Äôve been at 1674
            I got kicked from the queue
                Me too  snow I can‚Äôt login lol.

Edit becAuse I‚Äôm a skimmer and apparently there is maintenance.
            29953
            20737 here
        I was at 4743. Then I somehow jumped to 27548
            I think the servers are down now.
                Yes they‚Äôre down now. Emergency maintenance
                    Finally
                        Their twitter posted about it. 

[twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/BungieHelp)
                Yeah they had to do an emergency service of servers as we speak
            I don‚Äôt feel so bad lmao I‚Äôve been 8234 in place for 3 hours until the servers went down
        bruh i‚Äôm at 27001
        Which is still squarely in the "tens of thousands"...
        I was at 1610 for over an hour. My position never changed
        Hey, I got down to 2500. The character selection screen appeared for about a quarter of a second then got booted.

Helpfully Bungie told me that I was being put back into the queue and I will join the game in the order I connected.

9860.... but the queue is going up and not down....

10745
    I'm sleeping
    i think that's because the servers are dead and thus it just grabs the most recent number. also spread over 3 platforms
    I was at 98. Then I restarted and I was at 361. Restarted again. Went to 870 ish, now I'm at 2050. It never goes down. But after 20 mins I restart and it goes up a few hundred. The numbers are BS
Lol thank you
    Didn't Bungie post this in their post on the official subreddit?
        Yea I made it and someone put it on Twitter and bungie made it the megathread banner for Destiny The Game
That's strange everything should be 750 no matter what.
    [removed]
        You may just need to unequip and reequip gear when you get back online
            That wont work. My 10 LL gear is not 750. I equip all my low lvl gear and am able to get to 27 LL
    You can drop to ~150 if you had the base gear from the Red War.


My Warlock still had them for some reason, and they didn't get bumped up to 750 like all the other gear.
You never played destiny 1 on rise if iron release did you?
    I did and it wasn't even close to this bad. You just had to wait in line basically and once you were in you were good.
        I'm lol it was bad. Maybe worse. Me and my boys were in waiting for about an hour and a half. I waited 10 minutes and I was in on shadowkeep. They are taking the servers down now to fix it though.
            I remember waiting 20 to 30 min for RoI and then it was smooth sailing for me at least. I got right in today and then nothing but contacting destiny servers the whole time until it kicked me to wait in line. Almost made it through the first mission.
            Well, I‚Äôve been trying to get in for like 4 hours now . .  . So, ‚Äúworse‚Äù for some of us.
            [deleted]
                I been on ever since I got loaded in after a short time Haha about 9 hours now and not one single issue
                    [deleted]
    Gosh I forgot about that
I can't even get *that* far. It's all downloaded and its still gonna take an hour to launch...
    Gotta love that "unpacking"
        Yeah I turned my PC on ready to play and had to wait an hour. Then the game is at capacity anyway...
            An hour? Im on 6 rn and not done yet. My internet is fine, just steam being useless
                It's based on your HDD speed, nothing to do with internet. I'm running an SSD which unpacked it at 30MB/s.
                    Im not sure, I only say that because I downlaoded shadow of mordor fine, and other launchers work fine with no speed issues
                        Your disk could be fragmented quite a bit. Try running windows defrag, should help alot. You also could just be running low on space.
            I copied my bnet install into my steam folder... Didn't take long at all.
Rise of Iron was the sameeeee way
    Not this bad. Been almost 12 hrs since launch and no one played.
        Not true. I played for 2 hours. A couple people I talked to played from the start of launch so about 4 before we got kicked.
            It‚Äôs still bad. And the reason is because they don‚Äôt have the server space; with activision behind it they had the servers but it was crap game lol.
                Lol with Activision it was the same. They just released Shadowkeep and free to play at the same time. Also I posted that like 3 hours ago. So yeah it‚Äôs getting worse. We went live at around 1pm it‚Äôs only been about 6 hours.
                    You‚Äôre right; I‚Äôm just mad; I wanna play lol
                        Hey man, we all do. Just have to stay glass half full!
            I got a couple of hours in as well. It‚Äôs been down since around 4pm EST
                Yup. Right when I got kicked as well EST. I‚Äôm in Michigan
Mine said that but I noticed I didn't have a piece of gear equipped. Try checking that
whats wierd is one of my characters isnt 750
You would think since they had 24 hours and this happens every time they might have sorted it this time.
I saw it when Destiny 2 first released
Oh, be assured, this isn‚Äôt the first time in the past 5 years, but it is the most intense
same problem here, my hunter was like lvl 3 or 4 with 190 power, still 190...  
looking at my equipment i had the same items cloned with 750 power, but my bazooka was 0 so i only reach to 650..... buuuuut doing a few open world quest reach to ip 778 easily

    "Your place in queue: 20446" fml.
        Jeez it's really that long I thought ppl were joking
            For ps4 it is
                That's what I play but I gave up after 15 mins
                    I'm on ps4 aswell, I'm willing to wait
                        You're a better man than me
Although I don‚Äôt think this is really going to be an ongoing issue and I think some people are getting a little too worked up, I agree there should be a priority queue for those that paid. It‚Äôs a pretty common thing for free-to-play games with an optional subscription or paid expansions.
Haha basically
I don't think they're full so to speak it's just too much traffic sharing info between all 3 platforms
Apparently it's fixed. Place in queue 6484
Lol
\*me, knowing servers are down\*  


"oh, it finally finished upnacking!"  


"Too bad the servers are down"  


\*Continues trying to login relentlessly\*
Exactly how many reclaimable exotics and stockpiled Mythos Hack 2.0s do you have?
If you're being serious then yes the game is in a far better state than at warmind. Right now it's free to hop back in.

If you were joking when asking this still funny take my upvote
Its funny how a peer to peer game has server issues. They host NO DATA on their servers yet they have issues. Imagine if cs go in 2011 or 2012 whatever had issues with their servers. So stupid.
    I was thinking about that....how DID the "servers" actually go down if it is p2p?
        Because they do actually have servers? If you think everything is P2P there are actual login servers which are also prone to issues especially when having to deal with a huge amount of traffic like they've been dealing with today.
            oooooooooh.
        It's the login/authentication servers. Only player movement/actions is handled via P2P.
blame stosh
The login and inventory servers. You didn't really think Bungie would let clients keep track of their own items and progress, did you? That's exactly how you get your game infested with hackers.
It's unfortunate but expected since they went free to play and added cross save. The servers may not actually be full they just have to much traffic between all 3 systems if I had to guess
    The cross save page is broken rn too
Lol
    Damn I‚Äôm 14997
üòí I hate you lol naw but at least you got an exotic
    Man, I can‚Äôt even get Ishtar or DIM to even recognize it so I can check it out. Lmao.
        Yea that sucks
        I'm pretty sure Ishtar and DIM have their own places in the queue - it'd probably be best if everyone kept them off for now.
Saved an exotic engram and got Monte, feels pretty good so far
Right!
Finally ahead of someone 14997
Yea I honestly think it's because of crossave. The servers have too much traffic from all 3 platforms
Lmao
25526...
25,635 here buddy. Ffs
Lol it shouldn‚Äôt be a shock that the servers are having trouble on launch day
    True, but never seen it (or any game) this bad before...
How do you see what number you are?
    It pops up after awhile. It just showed "you will join the game in the order that you connected" for a long time. Eventually a number will pop up below that
Servers got taken down since base game is free to play and too many ppl flooded the servers crashing them
Eh I think it's a combination of crossave flooding the servers with too much traffic, general increase since base game is free, and improper planning
    True true; they should do a priority. If you bought Shadowkeep you get in before F2P
This isn't exclusive to Bungie.

Servers got taken offload be for both D1 and D2 and no eta on when they will be brought back online
    I'm in!!!
https://mobile.twitter.com/bungiehelp/with_replies
    Ty! Will keep and eye on it.
Servers are all down for "emergency maintenance" right now. No one is playing.
Use your new  finishing move on her.
Thank you bungie, Twitter, and many here do to. I'm glad I brought joy to your day
So the servers are on? What system are you on?
    We're both on the Xbox but I'm still stuck at a que along with the 3rd guy in our party.

Edit: just got in! I'm gong to the moon boys!
        Lucky you I'm glad you got in enjoy
Destiny doesn't have dedicated servers and with all the crossplay peer to peer connection is out of wack and the servers probably have to much traffic coming and going
    [deleted]
        It's not so much that it's easy or hard but think of it this way a highway normally has 2 Lanes on each side per platform (PC, Xbox, PS4) now imagine the traffic from all is on the same highway but ppl keep getting on and off no turn signal. It is backed up and can't keep traffic moving
Yea that is the worst
i went from 4700 to immediate login
Any word from bungie?
Yes
Yeah but you have to by it for pc though which is annoying.
    Got it in a humble bundle. Hope there are some easy step by step instructions
Base game is free to play for everyone
Base game and first two expansions are free.
Its a substitute til we get dlc
I am the original creator https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1179142336820867072
Oh no you‚Äôre finally gonna leave destiny after five years
    I didnt say it was a threat that I would leave or it would be a deal breaker for bungie you dumbass. There are a ton of other games and matchmaking and item buffs/debuffs are in a constant state of wack. So if i want to play another game its not me saying I'm superior. Just that it may be time to move on. So stop being a jackass
        Kthnxbye
No you can play all the old content for free. You only need to buy shadow keep.
I believe so yes. But I think it's also due to crossplay  flooding the servers with traffic from all 3 platforms
Bungie‚Äôs Haunted
I just wanna play so I can get that new exotic void rocket launcher
    I just wanna see the changes and maybe a quick crucible game. X`D
Lmao
Welcome guardian we are glad to have you
Play the story and only infuse into gear you think has good rolls. You won't need a clan but they do give rewards for being in one. Until you're 900 power you can play whatever you want
Just play.    Everything is powerful until you hit 900

Yes.  There are bonus bounties and drops fro
Being in a clan
It's a great game especially with all the new additions they've made
We're welcomed to have you guardian
Oof I'm so sorry for his loss
Jealous you were able to get into a second strike. I had to solo the first one. It would not match me with anyone. Figured the server issues were affecting matchmaking.
    Oh wow yeah I guess I got lucky
    That was happening to me... Like two weeks ago.
    Could it be related to your match filters? You can set it to only allow friends or clan members, or public, or none.
Second strike? I got to do the intro and disconnected while talking to Eris on the moon... Then got stuck in a queue to join so I gave up after 30 minutes or waiting. I'm still hyped to play. I kinda expected stuff like this day 1.
A lot of people are probably still at their jobs.
    I have no Internet because my Internetprovider is an asshole. So I havent started playing shadowkeep yet.
        Lol no worries, you can‚Äôt get in anyways
        hell yea
        Just like everyone else haha
        Jokes on you, even if you had it you'd have to wait 3 hours to play for an hour to get dunked on by a warsat so hard that destiny's servers kick you out.
        Same my internet went out right as I logged in and hit the tower. I rang my service provider who assured me it would be fixed within an hour. 12 hours later it‚Äôs still down üò§
        What's your ISP?
    This. Waiting for my oldest to get home so we can hop back on. We did get to the Moon though for 20 minutes.
    Like me):
        same lmao, luckily with the server issues there's no spoilers
    Can confirm, currently at work and getting ready to wait for a queue time at 5
    Yeah I‚Äôm at work.
    I played a little before but then got kicked off the servers, put in a que of 21000 and just gave up and went to work.
        I had a pretty good experience with it last night, I wasn‚Äôt able to play until around 8pm but after that I had zero errors and was never kicked from my session, only played about 2 or so hours though.
Speak for yourself.... I'm at 21661
    Well hello neighbor I‚Äôm 21663
        Suckers! I'm at 15713 and I have been for an hour and a half!
            Not no more. Servers are down to fix the issue. What you're seeing isnt right
                They saved my place! I've been told the servers were down about 6 times now and every time I try again I have the same number!!!


/s
                    No. Like they shit down destiny 1 and 2 for a major server update. Bungie is completely down. No one on this planet is playing right now. They said itll be up in awhile
                        Sarcasm man, sarcasm. Either you are playing along beautifully or I'm too convincing.
                            Why not both
            I have been at 381 for 45 minutes. I think people are cutting in line ahead of me.
                I logged in at 11.5k in line at around 6pm central. Dropped to like 1k something after 5 minutes got booted. I logged in again and within like 3 minutes of "contacting destiny servers popping up on the bottom successfully started playing.
            I‚Äôve been at 1674
        I got kicked from the queue
            Me too  snow I can‚Äôt login lol.

Edit becAuse I‚Äôm a skimmer and apparently there is maintenance.
        29953
        20737 here
    I was at 4743. Then I somehow jumped to 27548
        I think the servers are down now.
            Yes they‚Äôre down now. Emergency maintenance
                Finally
                    Their twitter posted about it. 

[twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/BungieHelp)
            Yeah they had to do an emergency service of servers as we speak
        I don‚Äôt feel so bad lmao I‚Äôve been 8234 in place for 3 hours until the servers went down
    bruh i‚Äôm at 27001
    Which is still squarely in the "tens of thousands"...
    I was at 1610 for over an hour. My position never changed
    Hey, I got down to 2500. The character selection screen appeared for about a quarter of a second then got booted.

Helpfully Bungie told me that I was being put back into the queue and I will join the game in the order I connected.

9860.... but the queue is going up and not down....

10745
I'm sleeping
i think that's because the servers are dead and thus it just grabs the most recent number. also spread over 3 platforms
I was at 98. Then I restarted and I was at 361. Restarted again. Went to 870 ish, now I'm at 2050. It never goes down. But after 20 mins I restart and it goes up a few hundred. The numbers are BS
Didn't Bungie post this in their post on the official subreddit?
    Yea I made it and someone put it on Twitter and bungie made it the megathread banner for Destiny The Game
[removed]
    You may just need to unequip and reequip gear when you get back online
        That wont work. My 10 LL gear is not 750. I equip all my low lvl gear and am able to get to 27 LL
You can drop to ~150 if you had the base gear from the Red War.


My Warlock still had them for some reason, and they didn't get bumped up to 750 like all the other gear.
I did and it wasn't even close to this bad. You just had to wait in line basically and once you were in you were good.
    I'm lol it was bad. Maybe worse. Me and my boys were in waiting for about an hour and a half. I waited 10 minutes and I was in on shadowkeep. They are taking the servers down now to fix it though.
        I remember waiting 20 to 30 min for RoI and then it was smooth sailing for me at least. I got right in today and then nothing but contacting destiny servers the whole time until it kicked me to wait in line. Almost made it through the first mission.
        Well, I‚Äôve been trying to get in for like 4 hours now . .  . So, ‚Äúworse‚Äù for some of us.
        [deleted]
            I been on ever since I got loaded in after a short time Haha about 9 hours now and not one single issue
                [deleted]
Gosh I forgot about that
Gotta love that "unpacking"
    Yeah I turned my PC on ready to play and had to wait an hour. Then the game is at capacity anyway...
        An hour? Im on 6 rn and not done yet. My internet is fine, just steam being useless
            It's based on your HDD speed, nothing to do with internet. I'm running an SSD which unpacked it at 30MB/s.
                Im not sure, I only say that because I downlaoded shadow of mordor fine, and other launchers work fine with no speed issues
                    Your disk could be fragmented quite a bit. Try running windows defrag, should help alot. You also could just be running low on space.
        I copied my bnet install into my steam folder... Didn't take long at all.
Not this bad. Been almost 12 hrs since launch and no one played.
    Not true. I played for 2 hours. A couple people I talked to played from the start of launch so about 4 before we got kicked.
        It‚Äôs still bad. And the reason is because they don‚Äôt have the server space; with activision behind it they had the servers but it was crap game lol.
            Lol with Activision it was the same. They just released Shadowkeep and free to play at the same time. Also I posted that like 3 hours ago. So yeah it‚Äôs getting worse. We went live at around 1pm it‚Äôs only been about 6 hours.
                You‚Äôre right; I‚Äôm just mad; I wanna play lol
                    Hey man, we all do. Just have to stay glass half full!
        I got a couple of hours in as well. It‚Äôs been down since around 4pm EST
            Yup. Right when I got kicked as well EST. I‚Äôm in Michigan

    It's not so much that it's easy or hard but think of it this way a highway normally has 2 Lanes on each side per platform (PC, Xbox, PS4) now imagine the traffic from all is on the same highway but ppl keep getting on and off no turn signal. It is backed up and can't keep traffic moving
Got it in a humble bundle. Hope there are some easy step by step instructions
I didnt say it was a threat that I would leave or it would be a deal breaker for bungie you dumbass. There are a ton of other games and matchmaking and item buffs/debuffs are in a constant state of wack. So if i want to play another game its not me saying I'm superior. Just that it may be time to move on. So stop being a jackass
    Kthnxbye
I just wanna see the changes and maybe a quick crucible game. X`D
Oh wow yeah I guess I got lucky
That was happening to me... Like two weeks ago.
Could it be related to your match filters? You can set it to only allow friends or clan members, or public, or none.
I have no Internet because my Internetprovider is an asshole. So I havent started playing shadowkeep yet.
    Lol no worries, you can‚Äôt get in anyways
    hell yea
    Just like everyone else haha
    Jokes on you, even if you had it you'd have to wait 3 hours to play for an hour to get dunked on by a warsat so hard that destiny's servers kick you out.
    Same my internet went out right as I logged in and hit the tower. I rang my service provider who assured me it would be fixed within an hour. 12 hours later it‚Äôs still down üò§
    What's your ISP?
This. Waiting for my oldest to get home so we can hop back on. We did get to the Moon though for 20 minutes.
Like me):
    same lmao, luckily with the server issues there's no spoilers
Can confirm, currently at work and getting ready to wait for a queue time at 5
Yeah I‚Äôm at work.
I played a little before but then got kicked off the servers, put in a que of 21000 and just gave up and went to work.
    I had a pretty good experience with it last night, I wasn‚Äôt able to play until around 8pm but after that I had zero errors and was never kicked from my session, only played about 2 or so hours though.
Well hello neighbor I‚Äôm 21663
    Suckers! I'm at 15713 and I have been for an hour and a half!
        Not no more. Servers are down to fix the issue. What you're seeing isnt right
            They saved my place! I've been told the servers were down about 6 times now and every time I try again I have the same number!!!


/s
                No. Like they shit down destiny 1 and 2 for a major server update. Bungie is completely down. No one on this planet is playing right now. They said itll be up in awhile
                    Sarcasm man, sarcasm. Either you are playing along beautifully or I'm too convincing.
                        Why not both
        I have been at 381 for 45 minutes. I think people are cutting in line ahead of me.
            I logged in at 11.5k in line at around 6pm central. Dropped to like 1k something after 5 minutes got booted. I logged in again and within like 3 minutes of "contacting destiny servers popping up on the bottom successfully started playing.
        I‚Äôve been at 1674
    I got kicked from the queue
        Me too  snow I can‚Äôt login lol.

Edit becAuse I‚Äôm a skimmer and apparently there is maintenance.
    29953
    20737 here
I was at 4743. Then I somehow jumped to 27548
    I think the servers are down now.
        Yes they‚Äôre down now. Emergency maintenance
            Finally
                Their twitter posted about it. 

[twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/BungieHelp)
        Yeah they had to do an emergency service of servers as we speak
    I don‚Äôt feel so bad lmao I‚Äôve been 8234 in place for 3 hours until the servers went down
bruh i‚Äôm at 27001
Which is still squarely in the "tens of thousands"...
I was at 1610 for over an hour. My position never changed
Hey, I got down to 2500. The character selection screen appeared for about a quarter of a second then got booted.

Helpfully Bungie told me that I was being put back into the queue and I will join the game in the order I connected.

9860.... but the queue is going up and not down....

10745
Yea I made it and someone put it on Twitter and bungie made it the megathread banner for Destiny The Game
You may just need to unequip and reequip gear when you get back online
    That wont work. My 10 LL gear is not 750. I equip all my low lvl gear and am able to get to 27 LL
I'm lol it was bad. Maybe worse. Me and my boys were in waiting for about an hour and a half. I waited 10 minutes and I was in on shadowkeep. They are taking the servers down now to fix it though.
    I remember waiting 20 to 30 min for RoI and then it was smooth sailing for me at least. I got right in today and then nothing but contacting destiny servers the whole time until it kicked me to wait in line. Almost made it through the first mission.
    Well, I‚Äôve been trying to get in for like 4 hours now . .  . So, ‚Äúworse‚Äù for some of us.
    [deleted]
        I been on ever since I got loaded in after a short time Haha about 9 hours now and not one single issue
            [deleted]
Yeah I turned my PC on ready to play and had to wait an hour. Then the game is at capacity anyway...
    An hour? Im on 6 rn and not done yet. My internet is fine, just steam being useless
        It's based on your HDD speed, nothing to do with internet. I'm running an SSD which unpacked it at 30MB/s.
            Im not sure, I only say that because I downlaoded shadow of mordor fine, and other launchers work fine with no speed issues
                Your disk could be fragmented quite a bit. Try running windows defrag, should help alot. You also could just be running low on space.
    I copied my bnet install into my steam folder... Didn't take long at all.
Not true. I played for 2 hours. A couple people I talked to played from the start of launch so about 4 before we got kicked.
    It‚Äôs still bad. And the reason is because they don‚Äôt have the server space; with activision behind it they had the servers but it was crap game lol.
        Lol with Activision it was the same. They just released Shadowkeep and free to play at the same time. Also I posted that like 3 hours ago. So yeah it‚Äôs getting worse. We went live at around 1pm it‚Äôs only been about 6 hours.
            You‚Äôre right; I‚Äôm just mad; I wanna play lol
                Hey man, we all do. Just have to stay glass half full!
    I got a couple of hours in as well. It‚Äôs been down since around 4pm EST
        Yup. Right when I got kicked as well EST. I‚Äôm in Michigan
I'm ahead of you. I'm in 4625
    Good luck
        I‚Äôm at 19158, I was expecting to get in after 4 hours of it being out, guess I‚Äôll have to wait.
Yea 
5595 here 

It‚Äôs not that bad right?
    Better than 14997
        That's much better than 16209.
            Rip I‚Äôm now 4105 hopefully better for you too
                A bit. I was in once, then got booted. Left and came back I was at like 30000+, now I'm at 8767 and dropping. Fingers crossed.
        Better than 15815
            Where do you see your spot in line? I am gonna have to remote access to my PC on my way home to boot and wait in q
                Shows up when you are waiting to get it.
    I got a message- severs are not responsing got kicked to back of the line.
Lol
6000? I'm at 17849 rn
    I topped out at 26708 and called it quits.  Good luck.
Yea I think you may be right I just posted it and it's already over 50 upvotes feels good man. And thanks
    I wish they were in my games üíî
Well you were definitely right my friend lol

        And it got tweeted to @bungiehelp

                This is the first post I've ever gotten over 1k upvotes let alone 2.5k and counting lol
Ik it hurts. To be honest though I never thought this meme would blow up like it did lol. This is my first post to ever break 1k upvotes and it's on Twitter and the megathread banner on destiny the game I'm really happy right now
It's a game that has a die-hard fanbase and when that base can't play they will blame any and everyone
/s? i was thinking about reloading because the number hasnt budged in a while, but if youre being serious, then fuck that.

e: awesome. /s  i was 15 and then i got an error. 1649 now.
    Apparently some people have a queue position of over 20,000
        I was at 29,557
Yea I needed to finish leveling my stamcro anyway
Elder scrolls online
Wait I thought destiny the game didn't allow images and how do megathreads work?
    [removed]
        Nice this made my day
Jeez it's really that long I thought ppl were joking
    For ps4 it is
        That's what I play but I gave up after 15 mins
            I'm on ps4 aswell, I'm willing to wait
                You're a better man than me
Because they do actually have servers? If you think everything is P2P there are actual login servers which are also prone to issues especially when having to deal with a huge amount of traffic like they've been dealing with today.
    oooooooooh.
It's the login/authentication servers. Only player movement/actions is handled via P2P.
Yea that sucks
I'm pretty sure Ishtar and DIM have their own places in the queue - it'd probably be best if everyone kept them off for now.
Ok I was wondering how it got there because I thought you couldn't post pics in destiny the game. Wait so that means bungie themselves added it üò≥
    Yessir, your meme made it
        Holy crap (shaxx voice) "THIS IS AMAZING"
Lucky you I'm glad you got in enjoy
It's not so much that it's easy or hard but think of it this way a highway normally has 2 Lanes on each side per platform (PC, Xbox, PS4) now imagine the traffic from all is on the same highway but ppl keep getting on and off no turn signal. It is backed up and can't keep traffic moving
Kthnxbye
Lol no worries, you can‚Äôt get in anyways
