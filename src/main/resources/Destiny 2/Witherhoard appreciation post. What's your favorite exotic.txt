[[Witherhoard appreciation post. What's your favorite exotic]]





When you absolutely, positively need to kill every muthafucking ad in sight: Trinity Ghoul‚Ä¶with catalyst.
    Getting into a strike and a random is running TG = well guess Im not getting any bounties done.
        [deleted]
            It‚Äôs honestly my favorite thing
            I remember one time a few weeks ago when I decided to make as many orbs as possible in a strike, I was able to get a bit over 200 with a withering shuriken build with thermoclastic bloom
                Combine Thermoclastic Bloom with Striking Light for even more orbs.
                I did that on bottom tree dawnblade twice
                    It‚Äôs very good with middle tree Sunbreaker too.
            Same I love the gun
        To a lost sector! It‚Äôs just strikes they‚Äôll be fine.
        I take that thing in raids for add clear. It's too good. Witherhoard may be a faster solution, but TG is too fun to not use.
    Had to scroll WAY to far to find the best bow in the game
        Lemon arc‚Ä¶?
            I'm not alone
    üêê
    I went to the comments specifically to look for my fellow Trinity Ghoul users
    This is the way. Makes the final riven encounter a breeze
    I run Top Tree Dawn and Sunbracers and the radial damage of Trinity Ghoul lets me get easy ad kills for my melee very quickly without using my grenade launcher.

Incredible bow. Would have used Ticuu‚Äôs Divination but... You know...
    This is the way. It's like an orb fountain. Once I got the catalyst I never looked back. So God damn good.
    Also Agers
    I use it for ad clear at oracles üëçüèΩ
    Add in the dunemarchers and middle tree solar titan, I just run around throwing hammers and arrows and watch the chain arc do what it does. Getting 80+ kills in a Gambit match, so much fun.
    Unless it‚Äôs a GM lol maybe with the bow buff it‚Äôs be able to one shot minor adds
    And even the ones not in sight.
Eriana‚Äôs vow. Being a jack of all trades and master of none is by no means a compromise when it‚Äôs a hand cannon that kicks like a mule and hits like a truck.
    same. Its the weapon that puts CANNON in hand cannon
        It truly is the most Titan of handcannons.
            A Titan of handcannons wielded by a Warlock (Eriana-3), most likely in memory of her Titan lover (Wei Ning).
                Ah, yes Wei Ning had the most titan of all primary weapons, The fighting lion. Cause why settle for a primary without explosions.
                She didn't die to the Hive, she blew her *bleep* shoulder off! And after so many times her ghost said, "F*** this s*** I'm out!" üòÇü§£
        but that one actually requires aim

witherhoard just requires targets
        We need a hc on heavy slot, how cool that would be?
            Xeno: Am I a joke to you?
                After the nerfs, yes
                    Unfortunately
    Is that a sniper in your pocket are you just happy to see me?
        A little bit of both actually lol
    I love erianas but I feel like there's not gonna be much reason to use it with arbalest getting anti-barrier next month
        This is true, isn‚Äôt erisnas a special weapon while arbalist is a primary?  Not much use when most of the best legendaries are also a special weapon.
            Um... are you confusing "primary" with "kinetic", and "special" with "energy"? Coz both are using green ammo, but are categorized in different weapon slots.
            They're both special, arbalest is kinetic and erianas is energy. Energy primaries tend to be better for GMs imo, another reason to run arbalest over erianas.

How do so many people on this sub not understand how weapons are classified? Special means it uses green ammo, primary is infinite ammo. Kinetic means no element, energy means it's either solar, arc, or void. There are kinetic specials and energy specials just like there are kinetic primaries and energy primaries.
                I meant energy, calm down there chief lol
                Well stasis also classifies as kinetic too
    Intrinsic anti-barrier is GOAT
        I miss anti-barrier sniper so much.
Arbalest. This thing eats any shield that you can come across. Even fanatic's bigass shield it chews through in one shot

Edit: oh AND it doesn't care about Match game, AND is going to get anti-barrier in 2 weeks. Literally the one gun that does not care what you are hiding behind, it's gonna hit you
    About to become my favorite lost sector weapon
    Ammo economy is so nutty with another linear equipped + mods.  I am always swimming in ammo in GMs while everyone is having to save their heavy.  Pair it with shoot to loot and it trivializes almost any gm
        This has me thinking, arbalest w my shoot to loot/dragonfly wolftone for an overload/barrier nightfall
            Oooh that‚Äôs a really good idea. I already got one way earlier in the season and Arbalest seems like the perfect weapon to compliment it!
            Its my go to whenever Overload/Unstoppable is in the rotation, you never have to worry about shields or running out of linear fusion ammo.  Depending on the nightfall I'll run aeons and green ammo finisher if I feel like sharing the wealth.  It might not be the most "meta" build but everyone I've convinced to try it out absolutely loves it
                I gotta get into the aeon cult, never actually ran it w 3 before
    The .50 cal of d2, doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about what cover you have because it is now just concealment
    [deleted]
        Arby, Arsenic Bite with Explosive head, Reed's. Taken champions trembling in fear right now
    Also love it in crucible too, still very strong
    How do you get that?
        World drop or from Xur
    Those bastards lied to me...

I quit playing for an extremely long time, like around a year, and felt like I had finally gotten the game figured out again. 

Now I'm finding out they buffed the fuck out of Arbalest (Initially, it didn't do jack shit to shields, especially with Match Game active). I gotta dig that thing out of the vault and use it again!
    What about heir apparent shield?
I use witherhord religiously
    Amen Brother
    same man got like 60k kills on mine XD
        Hahaha
        Got over 3k PvP kills on mine, idk on PvE.
        I'm at like 200k ü§£
            Cool guy alert
                Other dude was flexing his kills, why can't this guy?
                    The laughing emoji was mocking.
                [deleted]
                    and ur just mad bc u have a neckbeard ü§°
                        A neckbeard? Alright seems like giving a number on my witherhord kills triggered some people on a witherhord post. How does that even make sense I thought we all were on board with the same gun? Then you got these sarcastic clowns thinking they did something. Just wow. Can't even use an emoji to express my joy.  Ridiculous honestly.
            GOD DAMN BRUH i gotta get on your level XD
    Facts
        Ironic how this a Witherhoard post but people hating on you for no reason because you share how many kills you have. Sorry you have to go through this man
            Seriously, I don't get it. I share the same love for the gun yet people act so toxic. It just goes to show how ignorant humans act in groups and how detrimental it is to our society.
                Subreddit has been rampant with adult sized babies since its inception. I'd take as a badge of honor really. Way to go on 200k by the way. I think my highest kill weapon is maybe 4k. Lol
                    r/lowsodiumdestiny is the way
                        Oh my. I feel like I've seen Himalayas for the first time. It's beautiful.
                    I just love the thing, i use it in pvp and pve. Way too much fun with a sidearm to clean up the kills üòÅ
                        It's a super fun gun. And probably my favorite exotic they've released with the seasonal model.
Risk Runner.

    This and witherhoard are my go to weapons
Agers Scepter now, it's bonkers with stasis.

Special place in my heart for Two-tailed fox, Le monarque, and witherhoard tho
    Came here to say this. Ager's Stasis Well build is quite possibly the most fun build in the game right now for mid-tier content. I haven't figured out a build for GMs yet but I'll be damned if there isn't one.
        Worked in master VoG for me, everything's frozen all the time
            Care to share a build? I can't say I've taken it into endgame, i just didnt imagine the damage output would be enough to keep everything frozen.

I usually just run stasis warlock with mantle of battle harmony and a well build focused around super. Wisdom, intellect + well of potency has given me some stupidly fast supers if enemy density is high enough
                Elemental Shards, Well of Resoration, Elemental Charge, Veritys Brow, whatever charged with light mods you care to run. Stasis turret and warlock shards thingy. Veritys feeds your nades and shards charge you with light unbelievably fast. I run it with protective light and never die, or firepower for even more nades. (Or both lol)

EDIT: My friend runs high energy fire, says it never falls off
                    Try out battle harmony instead of verity‚Äôs, insane uptime on super with well of potency
                        You can almost infinitely run it on the souped up mode cause it gives you so much super energy back. I use the Agers/Mantle build in GMs to great effect, highly recommended.
    So much fun to sit in the middle of the blind well with that thing at the end of astral alignment. Supers for days.
I strongly believe in sweet business supremacy
    Good taste
    Only if you are yelling out, "GET SOME! GET SOME!" As you mow down ~~Charlie~~ Vex.
        ::Fortunate Son plays from portals::
    Went up against this titan in crucible who had an endless clip lol no one could kill him. It was funny, he was just mowing people down constantly.
        Actium War Rig chest piece. Reloads your equiped auto rifle slowly. I did a nightfall today and held the trigger down from start to finish. Absolutely bonkers.
        Sir, it might have been me, I've been going for the catalyst the last couple months with that build, I play D2 like 20 hours a week. 
It's the seigebrake armor set and Actium war rig, 
Sorrows verse with unrelenting and ascendancy
missile striker

I call it my Gundam build
            I have the same build but with a shotgun and I call it Heavy Arms. Anytime I just want some mindless destruction I pick my Titan
        It's surprisingly good in some competitive PvP scenes for holding down sniper lanes. Pair it with Actium and no one is peeking any corner.
Telesto, I like the guns design and having a chance to crash, makes the game spicy
    Also really solid in general. The flexibility of being capable of add clear and damage (and maybe some exploiting) is what makes telesto a really well rounded weapon.
        Yeah, i wanted it to because I just wanted to have the meme weapon, but I really love it, it's so good
Sunshot
    the only correct answer
    Sunshot is the weapon of chads 100%
    There are a lot of ways to do crowd damage...but sunshot explosions...this is my favorite way
It's my literal "fuck this shit" gun
Aight I'm gonna say it. Leviathans breath.

I don't care that its not meta. It makes me feel like a God when I pull that chain bowstring back
    It's a bow with a fucking motorcycle chain as a string, it's one the coolest and most unique weapon designs I've ever seen. It also goes 


B O O M
        Also fuck the people who say it isn't viable. I use it for strikes and gambit. One shot gambit invaders with AOE if they are near the bank. 2 shot mini bosses. Unstoppable enemies? Shred em.
            Right dude? I love it in Gambit
    Same, for me it's a tie between LB and Witherhoard
        Just something about the creak of the chain with the *WAPTOOO* of the arrow that has me making the happy chemical
            also if you listen closely you can actually hear your character taking a deep breath when they draw it back
    it‚Äôs getting archers tempo now too
        It is! Since when?!
            last week twab. coming in anniversary update
    The cool thing about Leviathan‚Äôs Breath is that it is designed to kill beasts far larger than you and the sheer strength required to pull the string back is incredible. I‚Äôve broken three bones releasing it!
        The cabal had some of their best engineers working in the LB
Huckleberry but I only have the one
    Huckleberry is underrated AF it can literally have infinite ammo in pve (especially against hive) if you have the catalyst
Cerberus +1
    YES ! Can't believe I had to scroll that far for this one.

It's the Heavy Bolter of D2, chunk-chunk-chunking its way through waves, tearing through 'em as if they were paper mach√©. That, and it's a monster in mid-to-close range in PvP.

I might die on that hill, but it'll be a hill made of corpses and bones, and I doubt I'll die any time soon.
        Glad to see another Cerberus user
Witherbae
    Now i‚Äôm gonna be seeing people in tower named Witherbae‚Äôs Only Fans
        I‚Äôd pay to see those glorious gelatinous globes any day.
i have faith in the bad juju
Never liked GL's till Witherhoard only equipped it at the start of Arrivals to see what it was like and 3.7k PvP kills later it hasn't left my primary slot often hands down my favourite gun in the game
    Same, what do you run it with? I have found it pairs well with trustee. Top tree tether and graviton forfeit.
    i have so many salty comments on my steam profile from using witherhoard + shatterdive in pvp
        Try duskfield and witherhoard. Its the cheesiest thing alive
Since anarchy nerf, witherhoard is goated
    bruh, it‚Äôs always been goated. such an underrated exotic
        Underrated? It's in control matches like *all* the time lol
            i play control *religiously* and i barely ever see it lol
but either way i just mean in pve, every one of my friends always makes me take witherhoard off
                pvp is what I play most, control and iron banner. I see it every day, it's used for capturing/protecting zones all the time
                    well yeah that would make sense. i see it sometimes but it‚Äôs still mostly used by blueberries because everyone just deemed it bad one day
                    Lol they're probably just grinding the catalyst. It's really not good in pvp imo, can't remember the last time I died to one.
Outbrake is my favorite
    Best sounding rifle in the game
    Same!
    Amen!
I'm just gonna say , I never leave home without my Hard Light.
    I've been enjoying Hard Light lately as well!
        It's really good for match game
Amen!

My second favorite is Outbreak.
Exotic armor: Celestial Nighthawk    
Exotic weapon: The Last Word     
yee: haw
    Hotel:Trivago
Matchbook üò§üò§üò§
    Hells yeah, that is the finest looking gun a warlock ever gave me!
Ruinous Effigy. When the catalyst came out, I finished it by doing the 700 kills, and then did all the eyes (which granted bonus progression for catalyst completion). It was just so much fun to use and feels so unique. 

A laser that compresses enemies into orbs that you can pick up and smack enemies with, ground slam for massive damage or create a life draining bubble around you. So diverse.
    Hate that you can't use both.
I'm a fellow Witherhoard entrepreneur. But I can't deny that every now and then, I'll slap on an Actium War Rig and turn my brain off with some Sweet Business.
Ace of spades
Fighting Lion, no other weapons can compare to it in terms of fun.
    Ahem. *Devil‚Äôs Ruin*
Rat king, being able to turn invisible on a whim is lovely and having the catalyst is a huge help. Running into other rats though rare makes me happy to see!
    Hope you do well!
    :)
        You always manage to brighten my day comfort bot, thank you
    Rat King users have some sacred synergy. Those mfs could be on the moon defending the portal and just ‚ÄúNy spidey senses are tingling!‚Äù as their gun glows ref
used to be trinity ghoul, but now it's le monarque
[deleted]
    Actually, no, you‚Äôre still in the Monument. Sorry that Bungo made it so rough for solos to get ya.
        [deleted]
            I've heard Anarchy + vorpal Cartesian Coordinate is one of, if not the, highest boss DPS combo in the game right now. As long as you're ok having no ammo left at the end.
Favorite Exotic overall? Phoenix Cradle.

Favorite Exotic weapon? Outbreak Perfected.

I haven't combined the two yet though...
ol‚Äô reliable suros regime and monte carlo
that or ace ![img](emote|t5_2we4j|5645)
The lack of Fighting Lion on this post must be remedied.
    I love it but that damn reload speed gets me killed every time I try to use it
        You shouldn‚Äôt be manually reloading anyway
        If you play Warlock and don‚Äôt have the catalyst, Transversive Steps are your Friend!
Worldline zero. Love me some beyblade action
    Worldline is underrated, 100%
    Hunter Worldline Skating is so fun
Tarrabah for PVP, 10,000 kills since I got it toward the end of last season. 

For PVE, I'd have to say Arbalest for actual utility, and Ticcu's because it's fun to explode everything and see a ton of damage numbers pop up.
Lament by far, rip and tear until it is done
    Had to scroll SO far down to see my slicey dicey boi. Lament for life
Withergord is a very fun exotic i enjoy using greatly, during the hardship of getting the catalyst I learned the arch of the gun almost perfectly and have now reached a point in which I can get a sniper (player or npc) with a singular shot from quite the distance.
Due to its nature of being a traveling projectile I also learned it‚Äôs movements restrictions and benefits from perfect area lockdowns to ideal bounces!
    It‚Äôs so underrated in crucible, in 6v6 it‚Äôs awesome at racking up kills and in 3v3 it‚Äôs awesome at shutting down an area or lane, forcing movement, killing supers and getting kills.

Plus it‚Äôs max handling means it feels really nice to use
        That people underestimate it is what may often give you an advantage, especially if used by a experienced user of witherhoard
            Let‚Äôs keep it secret my fellow blight launching amigo, the less of us that know the truth the better!
                Ai, comrade
    Same. I almost exclusively use witherbased
Suros, Malfeasance, Borealis, and Traveler's Chosen.
Mines Rat King, people give it a bad reputation but the TTK, and catalyst make it amazing
Honestly, pve, sunshot.
Crown of tempests. Because I‚Äôm royalty. And it‚Äôs disgusting in gambit with witherhoard.
been liking devil‚Äôs ruin recently. turn the corner and just melt people in crucible
    Try it with sunspots, and you will melt them. Bosses included
        What‚Äôre so good about sunspots? I‚Äôve been a gunslinger main since d1 and never really dabbled in the other 2 classes except for support abilities like ward or well
            Sunspots regen abilities, grant a pretty big dmg buff, and if u get a kill while standing in one it makes another. You can create sunspots with solar ability kills, and the bottom tree sunbreaker gains HP everytime they get a solar ability kill
Duality 

Graviton Lance

Forth horseman

Cloudstrike 


If you make md choose 1 im going Graviton all the way
    My man
Hawkmoon
As of right now Telesto is an exotic I use a lot unironically. It does pretty good damage and does it from a distance that makes you feel a lot safer.
Lorentz driver
Malfeasance, can‚Äôt beat the aesthetics of that weapon
THUNDERLORD AND HUCKLEBERRY THE OGS
Hawkmoon gang. Nothing is more satisfying that to lane all your shots on a big boy just for that last screeching shot to chunk it down to atoms
Symmetry. A hidden gem for those that can use it.
I have a masterworked witherhoard with over 400,000 kills and the drowned in strife ornament and it is permanently on my titan
I have to say my go to for awhile was wishender beautiful bow that hits enemies twice once as their entering and leaving the enemy making it deal massive damage over time and can see enemies through walls (good for PvP) the amount of times I‚Äôve seen someone try to rush me with a shotgun and I just tap them in the head and then a quick hip fire only for me to receive an angry message saying I‚Äôm hacking has caused me to move to a different more believable approach.
    Genuinely surprised I saw a Wish-ender. By far my favorite weapon in the game, even if it isn't meta. I just enjoy the way it feels and sounds
Monte Carlo.  

You a Titan?  Here, have more sprint-punchy things.  You a Hunter?  Take a few one-shot knives on your way out.  Warlock?  Well, can‚Äôt hurt to have some extra Conduction Tines time, right?

Can work with literally every spec on all characters
WTF, no love for Ticuu's?

I've fallen in love with bows for hard content this season. 2 for 2 on this double reward nightfall GM with it. Great for explosive add clear on the little guys, but not as dependent on getting a kill for good damage as Trinity Ghoul. An amazing peek-and-shoot weapon if you know what you're doing on content where anything can kill you in 1-2 shots.

Paired with threaded needle, which does similar or better damage vs. most of the power exotics mentioned in this thread.
Agers sceptre, I got it today and I got the catalyst first try!
MIDA and DMT
The malveillance
I haven't used witherhord even once, but my favorite exotic is thunderlord ot ace of spades.
Lament

Wish it had a cat ;-;
Fucking stronghold. Titan strong
If nobody's got me, I know Whisper of the Worm has got me, even if there are no Crit Spots, it will try its best.
The Gospel of the Great Lion is not pleased at you heretic...
How I feel with the Ace. Hasn‚Äôt let me down once since forsaken.
Either Sunshot, or Vex. Love the gun play with both, but Sunshot holds a special place. üî•‚ù§Ô∏è
Unpopular opinion: No time to explain.

Perks aside, it has the best natural feel and ease of use for me. Its also jumped my KD in PvP significantly since becoming my main.
    Been having lots of fun with No Time to explain plus an arc soul build. Double the fun.
If only getting the catalyst done didn‚Äôt take literal eons.
Xenophage üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è
Dead Man's Tale. Powerful, thematic, and synergizes well with my playstyle and hunters in general.
Sturm
Whisper, always and forever.
Vigilance wing, completely shreds in pvp
the sigma male witherhoard
Trinity ghoul is fun, but riskrunner is king against fallen
Hawkmoon makes bird noices
Skyburner. I generally love rapid fire scouts, and this one has seeeking (happiness), explosive (more happiness) mini-nades (even more hapiness) that stagger stuff (happiness overload \\o/ ). It's not shy in ADS mode either, still flinches.
Sunshot. Most consistent add clear in the game
In PvE probably Trinity Ghoul

In PvP Ace, Cerberus+1 or Trinity Ghoul

I love Trinity Ghoul
Witherhoard has been glued to my hands sine season 11, and I have bugged everyone in my clan into getting it too now
Four-way tie between my darling ladies:

Trinity Ghoul, because why wait for a thunderstorm when I can BECOME one~

Ruinous Effigy. I‚Äôll beat several motherfuckers with one transformed motherfucker~

Riskrunner. I have the power of tasers and cocaine on my side~

Transversive Steps
My favorite exotic is mina. Oh I love her <3. Also I gotta support my team one way
    Mina?
        That‚Äôs what I call lumina. Shorter and makes me more attached to the weapons as a whole
Cringe
I don‚Äôt have a favorite because there‚Äôs so many I love, if we‚Äôre talking about most used.
Primary: Outbreak Perfected, Vex Mythoclast, and Dead Man‚Äôs Tale.
Special: Jotunn, Lord of Wolves, and Ruinous Effigy.
Heavy: Eyes of Tomorrow, The Lament, Anarchy, and 1k Voices.
My witherhoard never leaves my side.
Sweet Business

Could you make a post for it please?
    I have two things for you. 

https://youtu.be/jrEqcrjshhs

https://imgur.com/2FDrtnX.gif
        Thank you :)
Last word lucky pants combo never fails me, except for the times it has
AMEN!
DMT
Outbreak perfected
I agree but I‚Äôll probably start swapping it out for arbalest after it gets anti barrier
I miss outbreak perfected being powerful. I remember melting the scrouge raid boss with 6 of them. Definitely one of my favorite exotics. Not to even mention the Zero Hour mission to aquire it.
Witherhoard, I have the timing down by heart and keep one ticking on a boss with direct hit and another ticking on the ground also on the boss. It also slaps for the weeks GM Nightfall (The hollowed lair) for the ad phases of the boss.
Bungoe pls sell the ornament again, I really like it.  :(
Well the gun may be old but gravitational Lance is still my favourite gun
AMEN
Witherhoard is the most fun exotic to run with a squad. Have y‚Äôall played against 6 witherhoard? 
The enemy plays the floor is lava, while y‚Äôall are just lobbing bombs in a fire line. So fun.
Probably Outbreak Perfected I know it's not amazing or top tier but theres something about it. I love the look the sound and the ability.
Tarabah
    Have been seeing a lot of videos with people using it. Dont have it but it might be my next pull from the monument. It just looks fun to run.
Witherhoard is really so great. It does decent DoT DPS and is super versatile. You can use it to melt majors or clear an add wave. AND it has autoloading holster? Amazing
I hate this thing in PVP, but it saved my GM run so I appreciate it. Chucked a blight at the boss and we got wiped, but the tick damage continued and killed it before the return to orbit timer finished
Whisper of the worm mains where you at?!?
Sunshot for PvP, Outbreak Perfected for PvE. Recently picked up outbreak from the kiosk and since I don‚Äôt use an exotic in my general PvE load out, I‚Äôve had a blast with a change in my preferred take on things. I also love how it works well will a lot of things. Just, not so much in Gambit.
Amen
Jotun
Lorentz in pve is genuinely so much fun. It feels like I‚Äôm role playing the mandalorian hunting down targets, dealing devastating damage and killing wave after wave of enemies.
In all honesty I really like zahlo super cell from D1 and I'm happy it got remade and sorta evolved into risk runner
    :)
Ah fuckin men
Last Word is my lord and savior, even if I play on keyboard. Slap some lucky pants on and you can melt bosses like butter, it's ridiculous
I am tied for sweet business and crimson
The Last Word because that was my first ever exotic Weapon when I started playing Destiny 2.
Even though it's not in my current loadout, as I'm still working up my power level after coming back to the game, Hard Light is still my favorite.
Best counter to apes and hunters who think they're a bird.

I'd like to think at least one of them has had a heart attack looking down after thier jump to see a pool of Death below them and my SMG already eating half their health >:)
2 for each slot bc im indecisive af:  
Outbreak Perfected and Witherhoard  
Polaris Lance and Vex Mythoclast  
Deathbringer and Anarchy
Thorn
Favorite exotic, even though I don't use it often anymore, is Trinity Ghoul. Its just such a good weapon with the catalyst
Hate Witherhoard because I die to it but it's so awesome so I love it. But I'm a huge Trinity ghoul fan
Witherbased
Amen
Trinity ghoul is basically my weapon of choice for like everything
[this post form the destiny 2 subreddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/qyegyd/witherhoard_appreciation_post_whats_your_favorite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
My fucking baby. Even if I have nothing to do in the game, everyday I log in to destiny just to play with my beloved blighty boy.
Le Monarque
sunshot forever. nothing like shredding an entire swarm of ads with a couple of bullets. just pew pew and watch the fireworks
I haven't taken thorn off since D1
The last word, From the day I bought the dlc it was forsaken on steam, the first thing I did was do that quest, then the whole campaign and all the content to come I did it with that weapon
Amen
Nope, this thing is literal aids in pvp I hate it
Sounds like a cult
It may be a little inclined to never take 1k off in any circumstance that isn't I NEED another one for a specific reason.
Witherhoard is a fantastical fun weapon and many different situations.
Become ball gun <3
Telesto will always be my favorite weapon in destiny. But this is definitely 2nd place.
Amen, hard to pick a favorite exotic tbh. I guess if I had to pick one, it would probably be Thorn or Sunshot.
Trinity Ghoul + Mantle of Battle Harmony or Polaris Lance + Phoenix Cradle.
Just because it‚Äôs fun, I use Monte Carlo. It was my second exotic, my first from Xur, and it sounds and feels amazing. I‚Äôm always hyped for a nightfall that requires anti-barrier because then I have an excuse to use it.
Last Word, Lumina, and Ace, always have all three on me.

As for energy and heavy weapons, Borealis, Sunshot, and Truth are all okay.

Skyburner's oath
Got the catalyst for Witherhoard last night...I love being evil in control
I love witherhoard but at the same time I am in love with huckleberry so I don‚Äôt really know which one I like more
Xenophage. Not that it‚Äôs top tier, just the design pleases me
Definitely xenophage, because it was amazing pre nerf, i love its design, its sound effects, and the really cool lore behind it just makes it such a cool weapon
Ticuu's divination is pretty fun to use, it happens to be the one I've been using lately. It's so fun filling a huge crown with the arrows and then triggering one and watching the whole group just blow up
trying to think of my fav weapons and i‚Äôm realizing now all of my fav weapons for PvE were extremely meta at the time i was using them‚Ä¶ Recluse (my first and only 5-digit kill counter), Salvo, 1k Voices‚Ä¶

am i a pleb???
An Insurmountable Skullfort... in PvE.
If you don‚Äôt devote your entire life to Outbreak Perfected I don‚Äôt want to talk to you.
Mythoclast, has been since I first got it in age of triumph in D1.
Finally finished the catalyst yesterday. New favourite weapon
Either Prometheus lease or riskerunner pretty much any trace rifle
I'm a fan of Ace of Spades and No Time To Explain.
Its one of the best guns they've ever added and IMO its not been topped.
I definitely have a list. Because asking for a specific one out of them would be heresy.

Ace of Spades, Witherhoard, Malfeasance, Last Word, NTE, Trinity Ghoul, Sunshot, and 1k.

DMT,  Tommy's Matchbook, and WotW get honorable mentions.
Anytime I‚Äôm dominating zones in crucible with Witherhord, it‚Äôs inevitable an opponent will rage equip it to come after me lol
https://imgur.com/A1fm3b7.gif
amen
I really like jotuun and le monarque in all sides of the game.
Crimson is my favorite for PvP. But witherhoard is always on hand for PvE
Outbreak is my #1 most used. It's been outshone over time because of changes and new guns, but I'm hoping the upcoming buffs to exotic primaries make it worth picking up again for endgame. It's pretty sweet in pvp too.
Honestly, Telesto has to be my favorite. Even though I‚Äôm able to use it like 40% of the time.

It‚Äôs really made this Nezerac Sin (or however it‚Äôs spelt) build a lot of fun for nightfalls w/ middle tree voidwalker, the almost constant uptime of Handheld Supernova is Amazing.
Trinity Ghoul, obvious reasons
sunshot
sunshot
sunshot
praise be the almighty
Mine is Le Monarque, I hope it gets a catalyst so it can make orbs.
Amen
I feel the same way but with xeno
Dead Man's Tale right now. Solid at both long range and close range plus the fact that I have a slight obsession with lever guns. Can never turn down a good yeehaw
Cerberus+1  
Its an auto rifle, but a shotgun and its technically a 1440 rpm.  
But its catalyst is only good for kill tracker and orb gen.  
It shreds in pvp too.
Witherhoard is one of the few kinetic specials I use, it's my second favourite exotic weapon exotic after Ticuu's Divination.
Best wep in the game
Sunbracers.
Le rriskrunner
After the damage nerf and remnant wither area fix, the weapon lost a lot of practical deeps. In raids and other activities you need to drop more than one wither to actually kill a large group of adds, especially if they are majors.

What I find funny and why it is my fav weapon too, is that it sometimes struggles to quickly kill a major or normal enemy, but a Boss \[legendary lost sectors for example\] just literally die from one or two hits. The damage consistency is astounding.
Amen brother
I love witherhoard, I just got it the other week and am trying to get the catalyst while I'm off of school for thanksgiving. But even without the catalyst it's amazing, it's like thorns big brother.
Red death love that gun
I get a new exotic I'm like 'oooooh, I'm gonna use this...'

Then I realise it mostly sucks and go back to witherhoard.
Izanagi's burden. Honed edge x4 goes blam
Two-tailed fox. I loved that rocket launcher so much. Especially in crucible. It may not have been necessarily good for exotic standards, but my God it was so fun to use.
Gun? mythoclast. armor piece is verity's brow.
Amen
does anyone else find it strange that the 'gift' we got from the tree was the void orb dunkorama and *not* the taken goop launcher?
Witherhoard is the only weapon that has populated my primary slot since arrivals
Ace has been a mainstay in my arsenal ever since I got it from Forsaken, and nothing ever feels the same as it.
Cerberus +1 is niche enough to where a lot of people don‚Äôt know what to do in pvp and it‚Äôs honestly a ton of fun
Amen brotha
any last word mains out there or am i alone
Witherhoard got me but the exotic catalyst sure don‚Äôt. ü§ß
Tommys matchbook, feel like im the only one using it though
Bad juju.
Tie between Witherhoard and Trinity :3
Whisper of the worm. I want it‚Äôs catalyst so bad. Honorable mention goes to fighting lion
Crimson. My headshot scoring baby for pvp
What‚Äôs that iron banner comes out and I‚Äôm behind in light levels. Either board has carried my lazy ass each iron banner
Witherhoard is the best exotic.
We walk where our ancestors once walked
My favorites? If it's esthetics then Outbreak Perfected, but if we take about what makes me feel powerful with ‚ú®style‚ú® the i have to say Bastian
Le Monarque is my current favorite one... And Telesto
Devil's Ruin.
It's pretty bad but I love the idea of a tiny ass pistol shooting a massive death ray.
A to the fuxking men!!!
I'll say it over and over, Dead Man's Take cause I fucking love cowboy guns. 

Yee hee haw
Tied between Last Word, Chaperone and Dead Man‚Äôs Tale. Yeah, you could say I have a thing for cowboys
Gameplay wise? Depends on the time period, it's changed a few times.

Overall? Wish-Ender. Even before and after the damage buff/nerf. I just love that bow.

Bonus shoutout to Dead Man's Tale for being so damned versatile and Bad JuJu for being my initial standard gameplay replacement for Wish-Ender.
Guys I‚Äôm ashamed to admit it but I‚Äôbe pretty much had the same load out since season of arrivals. Wither/knawing/guillotine all day.
    Still a good loadout.

I accidentally sharded my Arrivals Guillotine last week :(

Still had a couple of copies in my vault but that kill counter is gone.
        aw man! I should really experiment with more load outs and builds but when it's not broke...
Trinity Ghoul always üñ§
Arbalist
Traveler‚Äôs Chosen with Catalyst.
Witherhoard and Ticuu's for pve.
Ace and chaperone for pvp. 
I'm not very original lol.
Im a really new player and I got the riskrunner from a quest and i havent used a different smg ever since üòÇüòÇ
    I'm pretty new too, I haven't been keeping its power up with the rest of my gear so it's about 100 below my average.  Fun weapon to play with, and I'm pretty eager to get more
Outbreak Perfected. Still out damaging Mythoclast too.
Amen
Bad juju gang where ya at
1KV, for 5 seasons now.
Thunderlord and sweet business because Gun go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
Witherhoard sucks, lol
Devil's ruin
Borealis, sounds amazing, looks amazing, like putting puzzle pieces together when breaking shields
witherhoard, i had to go through hell and back for that catalyst
My favorite is huckleberry, smg go brrrrr, devour go brrr, auto reload go brrrr
Devil‚Äôs Ruin. That thing is such a sexy and good gun.
Huckleberry always got me
Malfeasance. And the new buff with the current Lucky Pants is gonna break it. Im so excited.
Huckleberry chads rise up
Strum with catalyst hits different.
Rat King

voosh
Amen chain
I scored a Dead Man‚Äôs Tale with Vorpal Weapon recently. Love strapping that bad boy on anytime i can
Love witherhoard with peacekeepers and an smg and warmind cells
Well, guess they'll nerf TG next, boys! Then WH! Because, SCREW fun and screw being useful!ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ticuus is fun
Malfeasance for me. It‚Äôs design is awesome and the exotic perk is one of my favorites. I love the versatility
My fav exotic is le monarqe aka what I like to call the cancer bow.
im liking Symmetry a lot, using it in both low stress pve, gambit and pvp. One of my absolute favorite in everything is Le Monarque
There is nothing in the world 30 rounds can‚Äôt solve.
Huckleberry, this thing melts in pve (and pvp sometimes) but only with catalyist.
I am almost done masterworking mine. I am so excited to use it more.
Jotunn since procts particle deconstruction easily as well bottom tree sunbreaker sun warrior easier for extra damage

Also I love how this toaster shoots incendiary tank shells  essentially the idea of it
Am I the only one who's going to say how amazing Tractor Cannon is? I love that gun, I play Trials with that gun, that gun gives me joy like no other, and most importantly, it shuts down your super and punts you into the grave as easy as 'BOOP'!
Currently witherhoard, might become arbalest after the buff
i hate it in pvp but love in pve
Cerberus+1, 1 gun 4 shots at once.
All day long - best solo player friend
Wishender the bow that sees all
Tommy‚Äôs Matchbook, self damage to ***Brrrrr***
Lament for my hunter. Witherhoard for warlock. And Monte Carlo for my titan. Staples of my builds for each class.
    For me, it's my Warlock who hates to put down his Monte Carlo. Combine it with Sunbracers and you maybe get enough grenades even for Shaxx.
Amen
Nothing like using tractor cannon to shutdown a super or making someone fly in crucible and having whoever you killed thinking what the hell just happened
What is going on? Why is no one saying sleeper? That thing is completely insane this season..
This weapon did not leave my warlock's kinetic slot all through Arrivals. I thought I liked it back then until I got the catalyst. Now I fucking love it.
ticcu‚Äôs divination
We need a poll on which is the best exotic weapon made in destiny 2. My Opinion - Witherhoard would win.
My favorite exotic is ticuu's divination. 
Trinity may clear trash, but ticuu's cuts through GMs like no other. Working towards 10mil PvE kills on mine. And 1k PvP kills.
Literally considering caving and afk farming just to get the strife ornament for Witherhoard.  I don't understand why they don't put all of the ornaments for silver in the shop like it and the huckleberry one.  The one that came out today would've been nice but has no animations or anything going on for it whatsoever...
Over 30k kills on record with witherhoard, can agree- Amen
Getting into a strike and a random is running TG = well guess Im not getting any bounties done.
    [deleted]
        It‚Äôs honestly my favorite thing
        I remember one time a few weeks ago when I decided to make as many orbs as possible in a strike, I was able to get a bit over 200 with a withering shuriken build with thermoclastic bloom
            Combine Thermoclastic Bloom with Striking Light for even more orbs.
            I did that on bottom tree dawnblade twice
                It‚Äôs very good with middle tree Sunbreaker too.
        Same I love the gun
    To a lost sector! It‚Äôs just strikes they‚Äôll be fine.
    I take that thing in raids for add clear. It's too good. Witherhoard may be a faster solution, but TG is too fun to not use.
Had to scroll WAY to far to find the best bow in the game
    Lemon arc‚Ä¶?
        I'm not alone
üêê
I went to the comments specifically to look for my fellow Trinity Ghoul users
This is the way. Makes the final riven encounter a breeze
I run Top Tree Dawn and Sunbracers and the radial damage of Trinity Ghoul lets me get easy ad kills for my melee very quickly without using my grenade launcher.

Incredible bow. Would have used Ticuu‚Äôs Divination but... You know...
This is the way. It's like an orb fountain. Once I got the catalyst I never looked back. So God damn good.
Also Agers
I use it for ad clear at oracles üëçüèΩ
Add in the dunemarchers and middle tree solar titan, I just run around throwing hammers and arrows and watch the chain arc do what it does. Getting 80+ kills in a Gambit match, so much fun.
Unless it‚Äôs a GM lol maybe with the bow buff it‚Äôs be able to one shot minor adds
And even the ones not in sight.
same. Its the weapon that puts CANNON in hand cannon
    It truly is the most Titan of handcannons.
        A Titan of handcannons wielded by a Warlock (Eriana-3), most likely in memory of her Titan lover (Wei Ning).
            Ah, yes Wei Ning had the most titan of all primary weapons, The fighting lion. Cause why settle for a primary without explosions.
            She didn't die to the Hive, she blew her *bleep* shoulder off! And after so many times her ghost said, "F*** this s*** I'm out!" üòÇü§£
    but that one actually requires aim

witherhoard just requires targets
    We need a hc on heavy slot, how cool that would be?
        Xeno: Am I a joke to you?
            After the nerfs, yes
                Unfortunately
Is that a sniper in your pocket are you just happy to see me?
    A little bit of both actually lol
I love erianas but I feel like there's not gonna be much reason to use it with arbalest getting anti-barrier next month
    This is true, isn‚Äôt erisnas a special weapon while arbalist is a primary?  Not much use when most of the best legendaries are also a special weapon.
        Um... are you confusing "primary" with "kinetic", and "special" with "energy"? Coz both are using green ammo, but are categorized in different weapon slots.
        They're both special, arbalest is kinetic and erianas is energy. Energy primaries tend to be better for GMs imo, another reason to run arbalest over erianas.

How do so many people on this sub not understand how weapons are classified? Special means it uses green ammo, primary is infinite ammo. Kinetic means no element, energy means it's either solar, arc, or void. There are kinetic specials and energy specials just like there are kinetic primaries and energy primaries.
            I meant energy, calm down there chief lol
            Well stasis also classifies as kinetic too
Intrinsic anti-barrier is GOAT
    I miss anti-barrier sniper so much.
About to become my favorite lost sector weapon
Ammo economy is so nutty with another linear equipped + mods.  I am always swimming in ammo in GMs while everyone is having to save their heavy.  Pair it with shoot to loot and it trivializes almost any gm
    This has me thinking, arbalest w my shoot to loot/dragonfly wolftone for an overload/barrier nightfall
        Oooh that‚Äôs a really good idea. I already got one way earlier in the season and Arbalest seems like the perfect weapon to compliment it!
        Its my go to whenever Overload/Unstoppable is in the rotation, you never have to worry about shields or running out of linear fusion ammo.  Depending on the nightfall I'll run aeons and green ammo finisher if I feel like sharing the wealth.  It might not be the most "meta" build but everyone I've convinced to try it out absolutely loves it
            I gotta get into the aeon cult, never actually ran it w 3 before
The .50 cal of d2, doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about what cover you have because it is now just concealment
[deleted]
    Arby, Arsenic Bite with Explosive head, Reed's. Taken champions trembling in fear right now
Also love it in crucible too, still very strong
How do you get that?
    World drop or from Xur
Those bastards lied to me...

I quit playing for an extremely long time, like around a year, and felt like I had finally gotten the game figured out again. 

Now I'm finding out they buffed the fuck out of Arbalest (Initially, it didn't do jack shit to shields, especially with Match Game active). I gotta dig that thing out of the vault and use it again!
What about heir apparent shield?
Amen Brother
same man got like 60k kills on mine XD
    Hahaha
    Got over 3k PvP kills on mine, idk on PvE.
    I'm at like 200k ü§£
        Cool guy alert
            Other dude was flexing his kills, why can't this guy?
                The laughing emoji was mocking.

                and ur just mad bc u have a neckbeard ü§°
                    A neckbeard? Alright seems like giving a number on my witherhord kills triggered some people on a witherhord post. How does that even make sense I thought we all were on board with the same gun? Then you got these sarcastic clowns thinking they did something. Just wow. Can't even use an emoji to express my joy.  Ridiculous honestly.
        GOD DAMN BRUH i gotta get on your level XD
Facts
    Ironic how this a Witherhoard post but people hating on you for no reason because you share how many kills you have. Sorry you have to go through this man
        Seriously, I don't get it. I share the same love for the gun yet people act so toxic. It just goes to show how ignorant humans act in groups and how detrimental it is to our society.
            Subreddit has been rampant with adult sized babies since its inception. I'd take as a badge of honor really. Way to go on 200k by the way. I think my highest kill weapon is maybe 4k. Lol
                r/lowsodiumdestiny is the way
                    Oh my. I feel like I've seen Himalayas for the first time. It's beautiful.
                I just love the thing, i use it in pvp and pve. Way too much fun with a sidearm to clean up the kills üòÅ
                    It's a super fun gun. And probably my favorite exotic they've released with the seasonal model.

This and witherhoard are my go to weapons
Came here to say this. Ager's Stasis Well build is quite possibly the most fun build in the game right now for mid-tier content. I haven't figured out a build for GMs yet but I'll be damned if there isn't one.
    Worked in master VoG for me, everything's frozen all the time
        Care to share a build? I can't say I've taken it into endgame, i just didnt imagine the damage output would be enough to keep everything frozen.

I usually just run stasis warlock with mantle of battle harmony and a well build focused around super. Wisdom, intellect + well of potency has given me some stupidly fast supers if enemy density is high enough
            Elemental Shards, Well of Resoration, Elemental Charge, Veritys Brow, whatever charged with light mods you care to run. Stasis turret and warlock shards thingy. Veritys feeds your nades and shards charge you with light unbelievably fast. I run it with protective light and never die, or firepower for even more nades. (Or both lol)

EDIT: My friend runs high energy fire, says it never falls off
                Try out battle harmony instead of verity‚Äôs, insane uptime on super with well of potency
                    You can almost infinitely run it on the souped up mode cause it gives you so much super energy back. I use the Agers/Mantle build in GMs to great effect, highly recommended.
So much fun to sit in the middle of the blind well with that thing at the end of astral alignment. Supers for days.
Good taste
Only if you are yelling out, "GET SOME! GET SOME!" As you mow down ~~Charlie~~ Vex.
    ::Fortunate Son plays from portals::
Went up against this titan in crucible who had an endless clip lol no one could kill him. It was funny, he was just mowing people down constantly.
    Actium War Rig chest piece. Reloads your equiped auto rifle slowly. I did a nightfall today and held the trigger down from start to finish. Absolutely bonkers.
    Sir, it might have been me, I've been going for the catalyst the last couple months with that build, I play D2 like 20 hours a week. 
It's the seigebrake armor set and Actium war rig, 
Sorrows verse with unrelenting and ascendancy
missile striker

I call it my Gundam build
        I have the same build but with a shotgun and I call it Heavy Arms. Anytime I just want some mindless destruction I pick my Titan
    It's surprisingly good in some competitive PvP scenes for holding down sniper lanes. Pair it with Actium and no one is peeking any corner.
Also really solid in general. The flexibility of being capable of add clear and damage (and maybe some exploiting) is what makes telesto a really well rounded weapon.
    Yeah, i wanted it to because I just wanted to have the meme weapon, but I really love it, it's so good
the only correct answer
Sunshot is the weapon of chads 100%
There are a lot of ways to do crowd damage...but sunshot explosions...this is my favorite way
It's a bow with a fucking motorcycle chain as a string, it's one the coolest and most unique weapon designs I've ever seen. It also goes 


B O O M
    Also fuck the people who say it isn't viable. I use it for strikes and gambit. One shot gambit invaders with AOE if they are near the bank. 2 shot mini bosses. Unstoppable enemies? Shred em.
        Right dude? I love it in Gambit
Same, for me it's a tie between LB and Witherhoard
    Just something about the creak of the chain with the *WAPTOOO* of the arrow that has me making the happy chemical
        also if you listen closely you can actually hear your character taking a deep breath when they draw it back
it‚Äôs getting archers tempo now too
    It is! Since when?!
        last week twab. coming in anniversary update
The cool thing about Leviathan‚Äôs Breath is that it is designed to kill beasts far larger than you and the sheer strength required to pull the string back is incredible. I‚Äôve broken three bones releasing it!
    The cabal had some of their best engineers working in the LB
Huckleberry is underrated AF it can literally have infinite ammo in pve (especially against hive) if you have the catalyst
YES ! Can't believe I had to scroll that far for this one.

It's the Heavy Bolter of D2, chunk-chunk-chunking its way through waves, tearing through 'em as if they were paper mach√©. That, and it's a monster in mid-to-close range in PvP.

I might die on that hill, but it'll be a hill made of corpses and bones, and I doubt I'll die any time soon.
    Glad to see another Cerberus user
Now i‚Äôm gonna be seeing people in tower named Witherbae‚Äôs Only Fans
    I‚Äôd pay to see those glorious gelatinous globes any day.
Same, what do you run it with? I have found it pairs well with trustee. Top tree tether and graviton forfeit.
i have so many salty comments on my steam profile from using witherhoard + shatterdive in pvp
    Try duskfield and witherhoard. Its the cheesiest thing alive
bruh, it‚Äôs always been goated. such an underrated exotic
    Underrated? It's in control matches like *all* the time lol
        i play control *religiously* and i barely ever see it lol
but either way i just mean in pve, every one of my friends always makes me take witherhoard off
            pvp is what I play most, control and iron banner. I see it every day, it's used for capturing/protecting zones all the time
                well yeah that would make sense. i see it sometimes but it‚Äôs still mostly used by blueberries because everyone just deemed it bad one day
                Lol they're probably just grinding the catalyst. It's really not good in pvp imo, can't remember the last time I died to one.
Best sounding rifle in the game
Same!
Amen!
I've been enjoying Hard Light lately as well!
    It's really good for match game
Hotel:Trivago
Hells yeah, that is the finest looking gun a warlock ever gave me!
Hate that you can't use both.
Ahem. *Devil‚Äôs Ruin*
Hope you do well!
:)
    You always manage to brighten my day comfort bot, thank you
Rat King users have some sacred synergy. Those mfs could be on the moon defending the portal and just ‚ÄúNy spidey senses are tingling!‚Äù as their gun glows ref
Actually, no, you‚Äôre still in the Monument. Sorry that Bungo made it so rough for solos to get ya.
    [deleted]
        I've heard Anarchy + vorpal Cartesian Coordinate is one of, if not the, highest boss DPS combo in the game right now. As long as you're ok having no ammo left at the end.
I love it but that damn reload speed gets me killed every time I try to use it
    You shouldn‚Äôt be manually reloading anyway
    If you play Warlock and don‚Äôt have the catalyst, Transversive Steps are your Friend!
Worldline is underrated, 100%
Hunter Worldline Skating is so fun
Had to scroll SO far down to see my slicey dicey boi. Lament for life
It‚Äôs so underrated in crucible, in 6v6 it‚Äôs awesome at racking up kills and in 3v3 it‚Äôs awesome at shutting down an area or lane, forcing movement, killing supers and getting kills.

Plus it‚Äôs max handling means it feels really nice to use
    That people underestimate it is what may often give you an advantage, especially if used by a experienced user of witherhoard
        Let‚Äôs keep it secret my fellow blight launching amigo, the less of us that know the truth the better!
            Ai, comrade
Same. I almost exclusively use witherbased
Try it with sunspots, and you will melt them. Bosses included
    What‚Äôre so good about sunspots? I‚Äôve been a gunslinger main since d1 and never really dabbled in the other 2 classes except for support abilities like ward or well
        Sunspots regen abilities, grant a pretty big dmg buff, and if u get a kill while standing in one it makes another. You can create sunspots with solar ability kills, and the bottom tree sunbreaker gains HP everytime they get a solar ability kill
My man
Genuinely surprised I saw a Wish-ender. By far my favorite weapon in the game, even if it isn't meta. I just enjoy the way it feels and sounds
Been having lots of fun with No Time to explain plus an arc soul build. Double the fun.

Mina?
    That‚Äôs what I call lumina. Shorter and makes me more attached to the weapons as a whole
I have two things for you. 

https://youtu.be/jrEqcrjshhs

https://imgur.com/2FDrtnX.gif
    Thank you :)
Have been seeing a lot of videos with people using it. Dont have it but it might be my next pull from the monument. It just looks fun to run.
:)
Still a good loadout.

I accidentally sharded my Arrivals Guillotine last week :(

Still had a couple of copies in my vault but that kill counter is gone.
    aw man! I should really experiment with more load outs and builds but when it's not broke...
I'm pretty new too, I haven't been keeping its power up with the rest of my gear so it's about 100 below my average.  Fun weapon to play with, and I'm pretty eager to get more
For me, it's my Warlock who hates to put down his Monte Carlo. Combine it with Sunbracers and you maybe get enough grenades even for Shaxx.
[deleted]
    It‚Äôs honestly my favorite thing
    I remember one time a few weeks ago when I decided to make as many orbs as possible in a strike, I was able to get a bit over 200 with a withering shuriken build with thermoclastic bloom
        Combine Thermoclastic Bloom with Striking Light for even more orbs.
        I did that on bottom tree dawnblade twice
            It‚Äôs very good with middle tree Sunbreaker too.
    Same I love the gun
To a lost sector! It‚Äôs just strikes they‚Äôll be fine.
I take that thing in raids for add clear. It's too good. Witherhoard may be a faster solution, but TG is too fun to not use.
Lemon arc‚Ä¶?
    I'm not alone
It truly is the most Titan of handcannons.
    A Titan of handcannons wielded by a Warlock (Eriana-3), most likely in memory of her Titan lover (Wei Ning).
        Ah, yes Wei Ning had the most titan of all primary weapons, The fighting lion. Cause why settle for a primary without explosions.
        She didn't die to the Hive, she blew her *bleep* shoulder off! And after so many times her ghost said, "F*** this s*** I'm out!" üòÇü§£
but that one actually requires aim

witherhoard just requires targets
We need a hc on heavy slot, how cool that would be?
    Xeno: Am I a joke to you?
        After the nerfs, yes
            Unfortunately
A little bit of both actually lol
This is true, isn‚Äôt erisnas a special weapon while arbalist is a primary?  Not much use when most of the best legendaries are also a special weapon.
    Um... are you confusing "primary" with "kinetic", and "special" with "energy"? Coz both are using green ammo, but are categorized in different weapon slots.
    They're both special, arbalest is kinetic and erianas is energy. Energy primaries tend to be better for GMs imo, another reason to run arbalest over erianas.

How do so many people on this sub not understand how weapons are classified? Special means it uses green ammo, primary is infinite ammo. Kinetic means no element, energy means it's either solar, arc, or void. There are kinetic specials and energy specials just like there are kinetic primaries and energy primaries.
        I meant energy, calm down there chief lol
        Well stasis also classifies as kinetic too
I miss anti-barrier sniper so much.
This has me thinking, arbalest w my shoot to loot/dragonfly wolftone for an overload/barrier nightfall
    Oooh that‚Äôs a really good idea. I already got one way earlier in the season and Arbalest seems like the perfect weapon to compliment it!
    Its my go to whenever Overload/Unstoppable is in the rotation, you never have to worry about shields or running out of linear fusion ammo.  Depending on the nightfall I'll run aeons and green ammo finisher if I feel like sharing the wealth.  It might not be the most "meta" build but everyone I've convinced to try it out absolutely loves it
        I gotta get into the aeon cult, never actually ran it w 3 before

What‚Äôre so good about sunspots? I‚Äôve been a gunslinger main since d1 and never really dabbled in the other 2 classes except for support abilities like ward or well
    Sunspots regen abilities, grant a pretty big dmg buff, and if u get a kill while standing in one it makes another. You can create sunspots with solar ability kills, and the bottom tree sunbreaker gains HP everytime they get a solar ability kill
I need to give it a try sometime haha
That‚Äôs what I call lumina. Shorter and makes me more attached to the weapons as a whole
Thank you :)
aw man! I should really experiment with more load outs and builds but when it's not broke...
It‚Äôs honestly my favorite thing
I remember one time a few weeks ago when I decided to make as many orbs as possible in a strike, I was able to get a bit over 200 with a withering shuriken build with thermoclastic bloom
    Combine Thermoclastic Bloom with Striking Light for even more orbs.
    I did that on bottom tree dawnblade twice
        It‚Äôs very good with middle tree Sunbreaker too.
Same I love the gun
I'm not alone
A Titan of handcannons wielded by a Warlock (Eriana-3), most likely in memory of her Titan lover (Wei Ning).
    Ah, yes Wei Ning had the most titan of all primary weapons, The fighting lion. Cause why settle for a primary without explosions.
    She didn't die to the Hive, she blew her *bleep* shoulder off! And after so many times her ghost said, "F*** this s*** I'm out!" üòÇü§£
Xeno: Am I a joke to you?
    After the nerfs, yes
        Unfortunately
Um... are you confusing "primary" with "kinetic", and "special" with "energy"? Coz both are using green ammo, but are categorized in different weapon slots.
They're both special, arbalest is kinetic and erianas is energy. Energy primaries tend to be better for GMs imo, another reason to run arbalest over erianas.

How do so many people on this sub not understand how weapons are classified? Special means it uses green ammo, primary is infinite ammo. Kinetic means no element, energy means it's either solar, arc, or void. There are kinetic specials and energy specials just like there are kinetic primaries and energy primaries.
    I meant energy, calm down there chief lol
    Well stasis also classifies as kinetic too
Oooh that‚Äôs a really good idea. I already got one way earlier in the season and Arbalest seems like the perfect weapon to compliment it!
Its my go to whenever Overload/Unstoppable is in the rotation, you never have to worry about shields or running out of linear fusion ammo.  Depending on the nightfall I'll run aeons and green ammo finisher if I feel like sharing the wealth.  It might not be the most "meta" build but everyone I've convinced to try it out absolutely loves it
    I gotta get into the aeon cult, never actually ran it w 3 before
Cool guy alert
    Other dude was flexing his kills, why can't this guy?

        and ur just mad bc u have a neckbeard ü§°
            A neckbeard? Alright seems like giving a number on my witherhord kills triggered some people on a witherhord post. How does that even make sense I thought we all were on board with the same gun? Then you got these sarcastic clowns thinking they did something. Just wow. Can't even use an emoji to express my joy.  Ridiculous honestly.
GOD DAMN BRUH i gotta get on your level XD
Seriously, I don't get it. I share the same love for the gun yet people act so toxic. It just goes to show how ignorant humans act in groups and how detrimental it is to our society.
    Subreddit has been rampant with adult sized babies since its inception. I'd take as a badge of honor really. Way to go on 200k by the way. I think my highest kill weapon is maybe 4k. Lol
        r/lowsodiumdestiny is the way
            Oh my. I feel like I've seen Himalayas for the first time. It's beautiful.
        I just love the thing, i use it in pvp and pve. Way too much fun with a sidearm to clean up the kills üòÅ
            It's a super fun gun. And probably my favorite exotic they've released with the seasonal model.
Care to share a build? I can't say I've taken it into endgame, i just didnt imagine the damage output would be enough to keep everything frozen.

I usually just run stasis warlock with mantle of battle harmony and a well build focused around super. Wisdom, intellect + well of potency has given me some stupidly fast supers if enemy density is high enough
    Elemental Shards, Well of Resoration, Elemental Charge, Veritys Brow, whatever charged with light mods you care to run. Stasis turret and warlock shards thingy. Veritys feeds your nades and shards charge you with light unbelievably fast. I run it with protective light and never die, or firepower for even more nades. (Or both lol)

EDIT: My friend runs high energy fire, says it never falls off
        Try out battle harmony instead of verity‚Äôs, insane uptime on super with well of potency
            You can almost infinitely run it on the souped up mode cause it gives you so much super energy back. I use the Agers/Mantle build in GMs to great effect, highly recommended.
I have the same build but with a shotgun and I call it Heavy Arms. Anytime I just want some mindless destruction I pick my Titan
Right dude? I love it in Gambit
also if you listen closely you can actually hear your character taking a deep breath when they draw it back
last week twab. coming in anniversary update
i play control *religiously* and i barely ever see it lol
but either way i just mean in pve, every one of my friends always makes me take witherhoard off
    pvp is what I play most, control and iron banner. I see it every day, it's used for capturing/protecting zones all the time
        well yeah that would make sense. i see it sometimes but it‚Äôs still mostly used by blueberries because everyone just deemed it bad one day
        Lol they're probably just grinding the catalyst. It's really not good in pvp imo, can't remember the last time I died to one.
I've heard Anarchy + vorpal Cartesian Coordinate is one of, if not the, highest boss DPS combo in the game right now. As long as you're ok having no ammo left at the end.
