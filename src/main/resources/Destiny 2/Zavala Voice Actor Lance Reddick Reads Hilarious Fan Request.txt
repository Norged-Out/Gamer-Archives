[[Zavala Voice Actor Lance Reddick Reads Hilarious Fan Request]]





I no longer have to imagine him staying that meme. we have the man himself. Reddick is a gift, he's a national treasure
    Someone needs to dub this to the intro video to the season of the chosen now
        *realises I can actually do that now thanks to trying out new ways to edit* 

Send me a link to both of these I can download and I'll do it, will not take me long whatsoever 

Unless someone beat me to it lol


Edit: I went ahead and did it lol

            You’ll prolly need to get them yourself, but you’ll get shitloads of karma if you do it
                Fuck the karma dude I just wanna do this cause it'll funny af
                    RemindMe! 1 day
                        Should've put it to 2 hours lol
                    DO IT!!
                        *oh, I will, trust me, my dude* 

Once i figure out how to download these videos and then merge the audio and that, it'll be *golden*

Uhh what's the command for the link to show up? Lol
                            Oh. I just finished making a dub. Mine’s not really great quality though so I’ll post it on my account for you to see and if you think yours is better you should post yours so that way there aren’t two Zavala memes rolling around
                                Yeah, I'll post it regardless and with my meticulous editing style, the audio for me must match up and look and feel as if it's a true intro lol

            Omg lol this was legit if only if it was in the game
    I've been a huge fan of his since I saw the Wire. I'm so happy he's being cherished in other ways.
        I get unnecessarily excited whenever I see actors from the wire pop up in anything else.
            Just rewatched ant-man. Something about seeing avon barksdale as a detective in a marvel movie made me chuckle, and all warm and fuzzy
                He doesn't often get a lot of credit, but (like Lance Reddick) he's a classically-trained actor, with an MFA from NYU Tisch. Love me some Wood Harris love.
            I'll bounce off what the other guy said about Avon as a cop... how about MUFUCKIN STRINGER BELL AS A DAMN DUNDER MIFFLIN EMPLOYEE.
                WHERES WALLACE STRING??
            Haha you should watch SVU! Been rewatching it and HOLY SHIT they are literally everywhere!!

I think they had the same casting director or something
            Just watched “King of Staten Island” and Herc pops in briefly and it made me jump. 

Also “The Little Things” has both the lady that plays Brianna Barksdale and Chris Bauer (Frank). 

God Alexa Fogel did great casting (and David Simon portraying) characters as chameleons. Everyone is impressionable but forgettable. Perfectly camouflaged.

Edit: Correct Fogey to Fogel
            I’m watching beyond the first few seasons of the walking dead when it first came out and I was real pleased to see some of The Wire guys together.
            Cutty being fairly major in The Expanse gives me the warm fuzzies.
            Love watching pre-wire Law and Order, half the cast alternately shows up as lawyers and/or criminals.
        Been a fan since fringe, haven't seen the wire, but man, the feeling is the same, the fact he's in destiny makes the game that much cooler.
            The Wire is one of the best shows ever made.
                The Wire is one of the best shows I've ever seen, except, maybe Breaking Bad.
    HE DID IT!  FUCK ME HE DID IT!  I can’t believe Zavala just dropped that line about clapping ass in new ways lmao made my day!
    Yes. His career should be named *Chronicles of Reddick*
    I fucking love a Lance Reddick. Sure he was phenomenal in The Wire, but he's also [fucking hilarious](https://youtu.be/iMv43Q5VxH8).
    I’m rewatching Fringe and love it when he’s on the screen. He’s just so damn talented. 

https://youtu.be/sTskUKq81MQ
    He will always be Cedric Daniels.
    He has a fantastic smile too.
    He truly is. Also one of my favorite actors.
    [deleted]
    He’ll be a good cast in a Western. Imagine an old grumpy no nonsense Sheriff.
    Indeed
    I tried to imagine his voice saying that in my head, but actually hearing his rendition of it was actually 10 times better.
Absolutely iconic voice. He was also great in Horizon Zero Dawn.
    >Absolutely iconic voice. He was also great in ~~Horizon Zero Dawn~~.

Every single thing he does
        [deleted]
            You should watch Fringe as well.
                Fringe is my favourite show, no contest. It's so good. Also the only show I've ever bought on blu ray
                    Came here to shoutout Fringe gang
            No spoilers, but 4 is where I generally question if I want to go through the whirlwind emotions that season and parts of 5 put you through.   Not because its not worth it, it just is heavy
        Wire is great, Fringe he's great and fuck was he willing to go hard as balls on Eric Andre's show. That performance pretty much tops his others for how out of left field it was just still fucking amazing.
        Charon in John Wick, especially 3
        He was amazing in Quantum Break, and John Wick
    *Spittakes.* Zavala was in HZD? As who? I haven't played much, but now I'm intrigued.
        He plays the character that looks exactly like him
            Literally one of the main characters lol
                Sylens
                    Kwaiyet
                    Name’s fitting.
                Honestly, I didn't put two and two together, but seeing someone say that they're the same person, I don't know how I didn't hear it before...
                    Literally the first time he talks to Aloy through the Focus I was like "WHY IS ZAVALA IN MY EAR" lol
                        Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Eclipse in Sunfall.
                        Same! I was like wait hold up I am playing horizon not destiny??
        Sylens, shows up a little ways into the main story
        Also in the Duck Tales reboot, funnily enough as the leader of the moon people. He said one thing about the moon and I just knew.
            "Moon's haunted."

"Let's get dangerous!"
                WOO HOO
        He plays Sylenz. He comes in fairly early on, at first he's just a voice talking over Aloy's focus earpiece thing.
        Here: https://youtu.be/BaWa4ScfQXc
            I laugh hysterically without fail every time I see this video
    He is amazing in the wire, and he wants to be like lavar burton.
        He was perfect and he wasn't even a standout in the Wire because the entire cast of that show is so fucking dead-on it's insane. If anything I kinda think Andre Royo (Bubbles) was the most underrated actor in that show.
            Totally fucking agree. And of course, like the rest of the cast, he’s amazing in every role he’s played.
            Def not underrated, him and omar were my favorites though by far. Everyone loved bubbles though lol
        I loved him in Fringe too. Probably one of my favorite actors that I honestly forget about far too often.
    [deleted]
        “I wish I were Lavar Burton” 

“Where’s my iconic slave role?”

“Eric, motherfucker.”

“FUCK ALL YALL, FUCK ALL YALL”

“WARP SPEED DON’T RAINBOW READ ME [REDACTED]”

“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”
            You forgot his best line: "You need a new desk."
            This is my favorite piece of television ever.
            Fuck I can here to post something along these lines. As soon as I saw his name this scene instantly flashed into my head
            Do yourself a favor and find Toys R Me. I piss myself laughing every damn time I see it.
        Yeah that was one of the best things I've ever seen.
    He was also fucking awesome in Fringe!
    Aloy: You knew HADES was there and you sent me to him?!

Sylens: I won’t deny I risked your life. But it was the only way.
    Don’t leave out his roles in John Wick and Bosch.
        One of these days I need to get around to watching John Wick.
I think I finally understand Zavala's mental image of us, to him we have the words "This Side Towards Enemy" painted on our faceplates.
    Everybody gangsta until claymore roomba comes around the corner.
        We are the claymore roomba
            Doomba
                ‘Claymore Doomba’ flair when.
                    You rang?
            When do we get the titan exotic that's just a chest piece covered in claymores?
                I mean that’s basically what this season’s exotic was
                2023
        Flair checks out
    I dont have coins atm, but you get my seal of approval.
        Odin is with us!
    I now need a helmet that says that.
        If they created a Titan helmet that said that I would never wear anything else, ever.
            I feel like a helmet with the decal "this side towards enemy" on the fathead  would tell you all you needed to know about titans all in one perfectly summed up sentence. I love teaming up with other titans. 

Edit: meant to say forehead but fathead fits the titan so it stays
    That's pretty funny, man.  Full IRL chuckle.
    ...nlt destiny..but OMG THIS IS THE WOL FROM FFXIV.."Sooo theres the god..DO YOUR THING BYE BYE'
        That was true until Heavensward 

Alphinaud really got his shit pushed in now he treats us like a friend along with the other scions
    That would legitimately work really well on a titan arm exotic that buffed the shoulder charge in some way. Could write it vertically up the arm armor, with a little arrow pointing to the part of the shoulder that smacks the enemy
    Lmao.  

That would be a good exotic ornament for a titan helmet.  

Just like written in marker pen.
    Watch the backblast

Thank me later.
    My bad I forgot to paste the link ( I got it from his Instagram)
        Do I need to ask permission to save this post?!? If so.... please can I save your post... this is awesome!! Worthy of being re-watched more than once when the need arises
            Bruhh u can save any Reddit post u want. It’s ur choice u don’t need to ask anyone.
                [deleted]
                    I’m sry u caught me in the act
                Yeah
            How lame can you be?? Just save the video who tf cares ffs
                Lmao fuck you! Better to fucking ask and be sure, seeing all these people on social media sharing shit, saving shit, than when they least expect getting fucked over by copyright and bullshit.

Or legal action. All because they didn’t have permission.

Never when that shits gonna fucking start on Reddit.

Get the fuck outta here with that “lame” bullshit. Better safe than sorry pal.
                    awwwww someone's feelings are hurt :(
    I love how he plays such stoic characters but is just a goofy weirdo on his timeline.
I love this. Should have been the real voice line
after hearing him as a commanding leader on destiny and seeing him as a serious intimidating police chief on bosch, his appearance on the eric andre show was bonkers

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaWa4ScfQXc
    [removed]
        “And that completes the meme”
-levar burton
        He was solid on Bosch.
    Caiatl: “bow”

Zavala: “you need a new desk”
        [Indeed.](https://i.makeagif.com/media/6-14-2018/p4to3K.gif)
            “Zavala, wait-“

**”Die.”**
    His show never clicked with me but fuck me that was hilarious. "You need a new desk" lmao
        I was worried there.
        I'm not sure if there's ever been a moment where a guest turned it around on Eric so well.  You can see in his eyes that he has no idea what Lance was doing.  It's incredible.
    I remember him first from the TV show Oz, and then immediately recognized the voice in Horizon Zero Dawn.
        I remember hearing him in that quantum game with the time abilities and instantly though "zavala?"
    you’re going to need a new desk
    He was also really great in Fringe and The Wire!!!
        Agent Broyles was S tier
    He's always Lt Daniels to me
    Uhhh, the wire???
        right????
    We just not going to talk about the epic ness of “Fringe”?
    lmfao. Never seen the show but what in the fuck
    Cabal need a new desk
    **What is this I'm hearing about an Uldren grand jury?!**
    "I WANNA BE LAVAR BURTON"
    I knew I'd seen him somewhere before! Completely forgot he was on that show.
Please tell me I wasn't the only one mesmerized by his facial movements when doing the voice of Zavala
    I was. And by his white, white teeth.
“Wassup can a raider come up in yo ship?”
“Man fuck you I’ll see you in orbit.”
“Guardian don’t hate me cause I’m max light guardian. Maybe if you got rid of that yee yee ass ornament you’d get some bitches on yo team. Better yet, maybe Suraya would call your hive ass if she stop fucking with that Conquerer or Rivensbane she be fucking with. Guuuuuaaaaardiannn”
    great, now we need lance to read this in ht evoice
    Knock knock Guardians

Hahaha hello Zavala. Cayde-6 has been awarded guardian of the month. 

You’re fuckin with me, right?

Man, we both being fucked with.
    You'd surely be overjoyed to hear that Drifter's voice actor (Todd Haberkorn) actually performed a Drifter version of Lamar's roast
Why do I feel like this guy is tbaggin and talking shit when he plays crucible lol
    [deleted]
        Yes he's actually a huge fan of the game
            IIRC he's a Warlock
                [deleted]
                    *ANGRY YELLING THUNDERCRASH NOISES*
                Maybe if he complains to Bungie directly they'll stop nerfing Warlock subclasses into the ground.
                What? Heresy. Purge the infidels
                    It gets worse, nathan fillion (caydes va) also plays a warlock
                        It’s warlocks all the way down!
            Oh awesome
            Pretty sure that's the reason he's the big name that's still around. He seems to really love the game and community. Reddick is awesome.
It’s funny how true the meme is. Big bad enemy has a new gun? I’m taking it.
    Guardian: well maybe I don’t want to be the bad guy anymore

Zavala: Caiatl has shiny knife

Guardian:

Zavala:

Guardian:

Zavala:

Guardian: where’s my anarchy
    I'm just going to be honest here. 

He didn't have to tell me Caital had a gun. He handed me a bow that shoots tracking solar exploding arrows. I'm just doing this to pay him back now. If I get a Cabal Tusk Coatrack out of the deal, I'm good.
    It’s so funny because one of the Cabal bosses in the Battlegrounds has a slug shotgun & one of my friends died to it, then immediately asked if we could take it off his corpse hahaha
I WISH I WAS LANCE MOTHERFUCKING REDDICK!
    WARP SPEED DON'T RAINBOW READ ME NIGGA!

**_AAAHHHHHHH-_**
        *We'll Be Right Back*

Legendary....no, Exotic!
question, was he in the first john wick ? at the hotel
    He was in all 3
        I knew i recognized that voice !! thanks
            i watched 3 the other day and when he talked i was like holy shit it's Zavala, didnt notice the first two movies either.
Am I the only one that hears "I wanna tell you about the matrix..." when they hear this voice actor in anything? That Clerks animated episode stuck with me.

Maybe I am in the matrix...
    Fringe is where I first saw him. Then The Wire
    Holy fucking shit he was in the Clerks. cartoon. 

I need to find my boxes of DVDs and dig that out. Don’t see it on any streaming sites.
Petition to rename it "Reddick's Broadsword"
I’m fucking dead dude i’m fucking done

This NEEDS to be the end of season quote holy shit
The *Eyes up, guardian* hit different there FeelsGoodMan
How good to see you again so soon, Mr. Wick. Shall I announce you?
Holy shit wasn’t this on YouTube or something? The original line as a comment on the trailer?
Lol he has gotta play destiny and join fire teams with that voice. It would totally trip people out.
    He does play. He’s a warlock main. That would be pretty funny hearing Zavala’s voice while he nova bombs someone.
    He already plays destiny, hed probably do it if someone asks.
Noice
This is the best thing.
Loved him in everything he’s done, but his Toys R Me sketch for Funny or Die will always be one of my favorites. [Toys R Me](https://youtu.be/GU-2C8Ec6co)
    That was fucking amazing, holy shit.
Pure gold
That smile

That damned smile
Rest in peace my friend. You were a REAL Guardian.
Rip
Damn this is tough seeing this after he passed
#MyCommander
Rip lance Reddick. You will be missed.
There is far too few Wire references in this comment section. 

Or am I just out of touch? 

No, it’s the children who are wrong.
    Agreed, these kids don't know what they're missing!


Edit:  I n d e e d
        omar coming yo
    I think it's coz of the sub. Unlikely to have overlap between destiny and wire. I saw this only because it was on /all
    I somehow saw an oz reference before a wire reference.  I actually had to double check it was the same guy because I thought i was wrong
I knew I’ve seen his name in a movie and kind of recognized his voice but he’s in John Wick!! Holy shit. Makes Zavala so much better!
    He's also colonel Broyles from the show Fringe and he's also in The Wire and Bosch. He's also The Captain in the Castlevania series on Netflix.
REST IN PEACE KING YOU DESERVE IT![img](emote|t5_2we4j|5643)![img](emote|t5_2we4j|5643)
Reddick was so good to the community. He always did fan requests like these. Rest in peace
    ❤️
Holy crap it’s already been two years?! Thank you for this Lance.
    ❤️
HOLY SHIT THIS IS ABSOLUTE GOLD.
That's the best thing I've seen in my life 😃😁
HOT DANMM!! I love that voice! He is such a BIG part of Destiny oh man!! I dug him in Fringe too!! And I hope he continues on in John Wick too hehe. Nuff Said
Cuts to the guardian trying to stuff the high celebrate into a gun

Guardian:get... In... There *collapses to the ground* man this is so much harder without Eris
I wish I were LeVar Burton
Did he say ass clap?
One.

Fucking.

Guardian.


Not gonna lie. 
Im a little moist now.
I lost it at “clap ass”🤣 hahahahahah
Goodbye commander, we love you
May he rest
God fucking damnit. We’ll miss you Lance.
A moment of silence today as lance Reddick has passed away at the age of 60. May he find the light and to all guardians across the cosmos raise a toast to a absolute legend. 🍻
    ❤️
I love it
This was beautiful I think I’m crying
Yas,bring out your inner Lt. Daniels

        I guess if I had to pick one it would just be "my office"
This is my new fav video.
*applause*
Lance Reddick is an absolute chad, I wish more voice actors did funny shit like this.
Caiatl: ... Understandable. Have a great day!
BROYLES!!
    There it is...
    I had to come ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE to find this.
        Agent Dunham?
Someone pls deep fake Zavala’s face in
He’s also in Lost and Fringe.
I don’t think this man is capable of aging.
He should have just used a ghost train. Would have saved a lot of exposition. I love that Lance Reddick does this type of stuff!
Lance Reddick needs to do audiobook narration.
     Lord of the Rings but only with Zavala's voice.
The man, the myth, the legend, the best voice out there
As Shaxx would say: THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!
I woke up to 330 awards and almost 30K upvotes what the hell
And ears open cuz ALL my social media stuff is muted unless it looks good, this was funny👍
u/savevideobot
My favorite Lance Reddick role has to be Christian DeVille from Corporate. Mainly be his juts being so deadpan and ridiculous. What a great craftsman. Truly put passion into all he did. Eyes up indeed.
goodbye lance 🫡
His lip has lag
yaaaaaaaas
The better intro you unlock after completing the campaign
[deleted]
That was awesome!!!!
I love Lance so much. He’s so involved with the game and the community, it’s awesome to see
This is perfect. Love Lance Reddick in everything I've seen him and now I love him even more.
Goddamnit McNulty
this is lore now. amen.
He loves this shit. One of the big reasons I keep Twitter.
God damn it McNulty am I gonna have to write you up as insubordination?
He's great. I especially liked him in Fringe.
This is what zavala wanted to day the he realized he had to keep it pg-13
McNulty, my office now
This is amazing he threw enough grenadines
This man is a fucking treasure
A great voice. New season of Bosch coming soon.
Yoo for a second I thought this was my teacher and I was dead ass speechless
He’s phenomenal in Destiny. John wick. And handful of others but I’ve loved this guy since FRINGE!
u/savevideo
That... That was beautiful
It's funny cause it's true.
This was golden..so funny. 👌🏻🤣 Lance's performance is on point, great talent. 👍🏻
I'm a straight man. I've always liked his characters, now I'm in love... Deeply, longingly, wistfully in love. BRING BACK FRINGE!
Just finished Fringe again the other day, fucking love me some Reddick.
I want him to play Quickben in a malazan series
This was fucking awesome 🤣🤣🤣

Dude... I cried with joy..
He’s awesome. But did he find a commissioner in Bodymore, Murderland that he has suction with?
I wish I were Lavar Burton
Its a masterpiece
The smile at the end. I love him so much
Bungie watching this with their elbows up and hands holding the back of their heads. Lol
Been watching this man on Fringe. The dude is awesome.
That was fantastic
LMAOOOOO this is HILARIOUS 😂😭😭😭😭
I fear no man, but a swearing, angry Commander Zavala scares me
He is awesome and I watch a lot of the shows he’s in but since destiny came out, I can’t not picture Zavala every time I hear his voice.

    This cemented him as a guy who can roll with anything in my mind. I can't remember any other Eric Andre guests that they actually let steal the show like that.
        Eric said he was one of the few that actually took him and the cast by surprise. When he slams the desk Eric was clearly scared as shit for a second. That look was pure, "WTF are you about to do next?!?!"
Fucking legendary
I don't know, I heard he taps phones.
he's so hot
This is legendary
I miss him every day I play.🫶
Rest well commander
Hold on wile I connect to may bass
Lieutenant Daniels?
Un-fucking-real. This was just as surreal as watching the GTA5 actors play out the yee yee ass haircut scene. This wins the internet for today. Thank you guardian!
Make this canon pls
This is definitely me when I think Justin Bieber sprays his DNA when he's in Paris, France
    I saw you having downvotes and I'm here to explain to people - this is a joke from the Eric Andre show...
        As soon as you said Eric Andre show, that was all the context I needed to know that there is no context

    You know Lance is a Hunter main, right?
Was thinking about buying the complete fringe series on xbox, this seals the deal. I hope he gets some of the $

I fuckin love this guy
He's awesome!
So good!

I wish I were lavar burton
My problem with destiny is every time I talk to zavala I want to go rewatch The Wire.
The smile at the end lol
Detective Harry Bosch!
Insert Dust Palace speech here.
Zavala quietly checking to see if I'm alright.
Now we need a Zavala deepfake version
Reddick 2024 🙌 specifically for his voice
This was hilarious and so true, I say this while clapping cabal ass while using stasis 😂😂😂
Christian DeVille himself.
Corporate was an under-rated gem of a show.
He only superficially sounds like Uldren, though. He's kinder, softer, more funny than Uldren, less arrogant and haughty. I can easily see Zavala convincing himself that it's coincidence.
Haha this was cool

Get him to say “where’s my iconic slave role”

Fuck Daniels, and his fucking ass kissing up the chain of command ambitions.
at last i heard Zavala say F*ck. just need to hear Zavala said Motherf*cker
Well done sir!
I love this man
Didn't realize he was the voice. Good in the wire. Funny on Eric Andre show.

Someone needs to make an unofficial cutscene with this.

Someone say something about a cool new gun? I’ll kill her ass right now.
If you guys have never seen him in The Wire I highly recommend it.
My bedroom shook from all that bass.
Did he do horizon zero dawn I have the illustration book and the bad dude looks just like him
Thank you soo much!!!
YYYEEESSSS
He's the best
“And as always, it was a pleasure... Mr Wick”

Lieutenant Daniels for the win
Never liked Daniels much
Okay can the destiny threads obtain peace through this?
That was more badass than hilarious
Petition to make this the highest rated post on /r/destiny2 . This was perfect
ok, i’m sorry, but he’s definitely looking in more than one direction in this video and i cant stop laughing

What a legend. You can't not love this man.
I've been watching Fringe and I thought Broyles voice sounded fucking familiar.
[TOYS R ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU-2C8Ec6co)
Does someone have a transcript? I'm having a hard time piecing the words together
God hes such a good voice actor and actor in general. He was amazing in the wire. He also had a funny or die sketch where he ran a place called "TOYS R' ME" and its so absurdly good
Wow - what a voice ...
He’s right. I would find a way to kind any one Zavala told me to if they had a fancy new gun.
Every one crying over white voice actors voicing coloured characters but no one bats an eye lid when someone coloured voices a literal pale white man. I fucking love this guy
Did Bubs sell him that tank top
Wait is this the hotel guy from John Wick movies?
It's weird hearing him swear
Reddick is my new favorite voice actor, I liked him before but now I love him
I read that tweet the other day! This is awesome!
Warpspeed nigga
If you like Lance Reddick, do yourself a favor and watch the show Corporate. He’s amazing in pretty much every single scene he’s in.
This dude has played a cop so many times that if he tried to arrest me i’d let him
Nice try, IHOP!
My life is complete I can die happy
I loved this guy in Fringe!
How can I save this video??
Bless.
Lance Reddick is cool as hell. Loved him on the Wire!
IDK what Zavala is, but Lieutenant Daniels still has an amazing voice
Played by a black guy. Surprise for me lol and he's good to. Great acting to
He looks so pleased with himself I cannot
I wish I could upvote this more.  I love it when folks are willing to engage with the fanbase like this.  Thank you !
Well great, now I like Zavala
Fucking amazing
Where’s my iconic slave role?!

What an absolute legend.
Need him to say okay guardian you are my little pog champ
Daamn i didnt know he looked so much like sylens

Dear God its Toys R Me. Never realized they were one and the same!

This is some serious credit right here that was great this is the zavala we need.
This is amazing.
Loved watching him on Fringe.
Nah. That’s Sylens.
This is the dude from Fringe!
This. This right here. This right here is gold.
I wonder if he plays Destiny. Been watching The Wire lately and he’s really good there too.
    He likes to play warlock despite his character in the game
What a sexy voice
This is better than that one time in For Honor where a voice actor for the broken hero at the time did the same thing but with only three words
That's Sylens and no one can tell me otherwise.
YEEEEEEEEES

        Omg lol this was legit if only if it was in the game
I've been a huge fan of his since I saw the Wire. I'm so happy he's being cherished in other ways.
    I get unnecessarily excited whenever I see actors from the wire pop up in anything else.
        Just rewatched ant-man. Something about seeing avon barksdale as a detective in a marvel movie made me chuckle, and all warm and fuzzy
            He doesn't often get a lot of credit, but (like Lance Reddick) he's a classically-trained actor, with an MFA from NYU Tisch. Love me some Wood Harris love.
        I'll bounce off what the other guy said about Avon as a cop... how about MUFUCKIN STRINGER BELL AS A DAMN DUNDER MIFFLIN EMPLOYEE.
            WHERES WALLACE STRING??
        Haha you should watch SVU! Been rewatching it and HOLY SHIT they are literally everywhere!!

I think they had the same casting director or something
        Just watched “King of Staten Island” and Herc pops in briefly and it made me jump. 

Also “The Little Things” has both the lady that plays Brianna Barksdale and Chris Bauer (Frank). 

God Alexa Fogel did great casting (and David Simon portraying) characters as chameleons. Everyone is impressionable but forgettable. Perfectly camouflaged.

Edit: Correct Fogey to Fogel
        I’m watching beyond the first few seasons of the walking dead when it first came out and I was real pleased to see some of The Wire guys together.
        Cutty being fairly major in The Expanse gives me the warm fuzzies.
        Love watching pre-wire Law and Order, half the cast alternately shows up as lawyers and/or criminals.
    Been a fan since fringe, haven't seen the wire, but man, the feeling is the same, the fact he's in destiny makes the game that much cooler.
        The Wire is one of the best shows ever made.
            The Wire is one of the best shows I've ever seen, except, maybe Breaking Bad.
HE DID IT!  FUCK ME HE DID IT!  I can’t believe Zavala just dropped that line about clapping ass in new ways lmao made my day!
Yes. His career should be named *Chronicles of Reddick*
I fucking love a Lance Reddick. Sure he was phenomenal in The Wire, but he's also [fucking hilarious](https://youtu.be/iMv43Q5VxH8).
I’m rewatching Fringe and love it when he’s on the screen. He’s just so damn talented. 

https://youtu.be/sTskUKq81MQ
He will always be Cedric Daniels.
He has a fantastic smile too.
He truly is. Also one of my favorite actors.
[deleted]
He’ll be a good cast in a Western. Imagine an old grumpy no nonsense Sheriff.
Indeed
I tried to imagine his voice saying that in my head, but actually hearing his rendition of it was actually 10 times better.
>Absolutely iconic voice. He was also great in ~~Horizon Zero Dawn~~.

Every single thing he does
    [deleted]
        You should watch Fringe as well.
            Fringe is my favourite show, no contest. It's so good. Also the only show I've ever bought on blu ray
                Came here to shoutout Fringe gang
        No spoilers, but 4 is where I generally question if I want to go through the whirlwind emotions that season and parts of 5 put you through.   Not because its not worth it, it just is heavy
    Wire is great, Fringe he's great and fuck was he willing to go hard as balls on Eric Andre's show. That performance pretty much tops his others for how out of left field it was just still fucking amazing.
    Charon in John Wick, especially 3
    He was amazing in Quantum Break, and John Wick
*Spittakes.* Zavala was in HZD? As who? I haven't played much, but now I'm intrigued.
    He plays the character that looks exactly like him
        Literally one of the main characters lol
            Sylens
                Kwaiyet
                Name’s fitting.
            Honestly, I didn't put two and two together, but seeing someone say that they're the same person, I don't know how I didn't hear it before...
                Literally the first time he talks to Aloy through the Focus I was like "WHY IS ZAVALA IN MY EAR" lol
                    Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Eclipse in Sunfall.
                    Same! I was like wait hold up I am playing horizon not destiny??
    Sylens, shows up a little ways into the main story
    Also in the Duck Tales reboot, funnily enough as the leader of the moon people. He said one thing about the moon and I just knew.
        "Moon's haunted."

"Let's get dangerous!"
            WOO HOO
    He plays Sylenz. He comes in fairly early on, at first he's just a voice talking over Aloy's focus earpiece thing.
    Here: https://youtu.be/BaWa4ScfQXc
        I laugh hysterically without fail every time I see this video
He is amazing in the wire, and he wants to be like lavar burton.
    He was perfect and he wasn't even a standout in the Wire because the entire cast of that show is so fucking dead-on it's insane. If anything I kinda think Andre Royo (Bubbles) was the most underrated actor in that show.
        Totally fucking agree. And of course, like the rest of the cast, he’s amazing in every role he’s played.
        Def not underrated, him and omar were my favorites though by far. Everyone loved bubbles though lol
    I loved him in Fringe too. Probably one of my favorite actors that I honestly forget about far too often.

    “I wish I were Lavar Burton” 

“Where’s my iconic slave role?”

“Eric, motherfucker.”

“FUCK ALL YALL, FUCK ALL YALL”

“WARP SPEED DON’T RAINBOW READ ME [REDACTED]”

“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”
        You forgot his best line: "You need a new desk."
        This is my favorite piece of television ever.
        Fuck I can here to post something along these lines. As soon as I saw his name this scene instantly flashed into my head
        Do yourself a favor and find Toys R Me. I piss myself laughing every damn time I see it.
    Yeah that was one of the best things I've ever seen.
He was also fucking awesome in Fringe!
Aloy: You knew HADES was there and you sent me to him?!

Sylens: I won’t deny I risked your life. But it was the only way.
Don’t leave out his roles in John Wick and Bosch.
    One of these days I need to get around to watching John Wick.
Everybody gangsta until claymore roomba comes around the corner.
    We are the claymore roomba

        When do we get the titan exotic that's just a chest piece covered in claymores?
            I mean that’s basically what this season’s exotic was
            2023
    Flair checks out
I dont have coins atm, but you get my seal of approval.
    Odin is with us!
I now need a helmet that says that.
    If they created a Titan helmet that said that I would never wear anything else, ever.
        I feel like a helmet with the decal "this side towards enemy" on the fathead  would tell you all you needed to know about titans all in one perfectly summed up sentence. I love teaming up with other titans. 

Edit: meant to say forehead but fathead fits the titan so it stays
That's pretty funny, man.  Full IRL chuckle.
...nlt destiny..but OMG THIS IS THE WOL FROM FFXIV.."Sooo theres the god..DO YOUR THING BYE BYE'
    That was true until Heavensward 

Alphinaud really got his shit pushed in now he treats us like a friend along with the other scions
That would legitimately work really well on a titan arm exotic that buffed the shoulder charge in some way. Could write it vertically up the arm armor, with a little arrow pointing to the part of the shoulder that smacks the enemy
Lmao.  

That would be a good exotic ornament for a titan helmet.  

Just like written in marker pen.

Never when that shits gonna fucking start on Reddit.

Get the fuck outta here with that “lame” bullshit. Better safe than sorry pal.
                awwwww someone's feelings are hurt :(

**”Die.”**
His show never clicked with me but fuck me that was hilarious. "You need a new desk" lmao
    I was worried there.
    I'm not sure if there's ever been a moment where a guest turned it around on Eric so well.  You can see in his eyes that he has no idea what Lance was doing.  It's incredible.
I remember him first from the TV show Oz, and then immediately recognized the voice in Horizon Zero Dawn.
    I remember hearing him in that quantum game with the time abilities and instantly though "zavala?"
you’re going to need a new desk
He was also really great in Fringe and The Wire!!!
    Agent Broyles was S tier
He's always Lt Daniels to me
Uhhh, the wire???
    right????
We just not going to talk about the epic ness of “Fringe”?
lmfao. Never seen the show but what in the fuck
Cabal need a new desk
**What is this I'm hearing about an Uldren grand jury?!**
"I WANNA BE LAVAR BURTON"
I knew I'd seen him somewhere before! Completely forgot he was on that show.
I was. And by his white, white teeth.
great, now we need lance to read this in ht evoice
Knock knock Guardians

Hahaha hello Zavala. Cayde-6 has been awarded guardian of the month. 

You’re fuckin with me, right?

Man, we both being fucked with.
You'd surely be overjoyed to hear that Drifter's voice actor (Todd Haberkorn) actually performed a Drifter version of Lamar's roast

                *ANGRY YELLING THUNDERCRASH NOISES*
            Maybe if he complains to Bungie directly they'll stop nerfing Warlock subclasses into the ground.
            What? Heresy. Purge the infidels
                It gets worse, nathan fillion (caydes va) also plays a warlock
                    It’s warlocks all the way down!
        Oh awesome
        Pretty sure that's the reason he's the big name that's still around. He seems to really love the game and community. Reddick is awesome.
Guardian: well maybe I don’t want to be the bad guy anymore

Zavala: Caiatl has shiny knife

Guardian:

Zavala:

Guardian:

Zavala:

Guardian: where’s my anarchy
I'm just going to be honest here. 

He didn't have to tell me Caital had a gun. He handed me a bow that shoots tracking solar exploding arrows. I'm just doing this to pay him back now. If I get a Cabal Tusk Coatrack out of the deal, I'm good.
It’s so funny because one of the Cabal bosses in the Battlegrounds has a slug shotgun & one of my friends died to it, then immediately asked if we could take it off his corpse hahaha

He was in all 3
    I knew i recognized that voice !! thanks
        i watched 3 the other day and when he talked i was like holy shit it's Zavala, didnt notice the first two movies either.
Fringe is where I first saw him. Then The Wire
Holy fucking shit he was in the Clerks. cartoon. 

I need to find my boxes of DVDs and dig that out. Don’t see it on any streaming sites.
He does play. He’s a warlock main. That would be pretty funny hearing Zavala’s voice while he nova bombs someone.
He already plays destiny, hed probably do it if someone asks.
That was fucking amazing, holy shit.
Agreed, these kids don't know what they're missing!


Edit:  I n d e e d
    omar coming yo
I think it's coz of the sub. Unlikely to have overlap between destiny and wire. I saw this only because it was on /all
I somehow saw an oz reference before a wire reference.  I actually had to double check it was the same guy because I thought i was wrong
He's also colonel Broyles from the show Fringe and he's also in The Wire and Bosch. He's also The Captain in the Castlevania series on Netflix.

This cemented him as a guy who can roll with anything in my mind. I can't remember any other Eric Andre guests that they actually let steal the show like that.
    Eric said he was one of the few that actually took him and the cast by surprise. When he slams the desk Eric was clearly scared as shit for a second. That look was pure, "WTF are you about to do next?!?!"
I saw you having downvotes and I'm here to explain to people - this is a joke from the Eric Andre show...
    As soon as you said Eric Andre show, that was all the context I needed to know that there is no context
You know Lance is a Hunter main, right?

    I'll bounce off what the other guy said about Avon as a cop... how about MUFUCKIN STRINGER BELL AS A DAMN DUNDER MIFFLIN EMPLOYEE.
        WHERES WALLACE STRING??
    Haha you should watch SVU! Been rewatching it and HOLY SHIT they are literally everywhere!!

I think they had the same casting director or something
    Just watched “King of Staten Island” and Herc pops in briefly and it made me jump. 

Also “The Little Things” has both the lady that plays Brianna Barksdale and Chris Bauer (Frank). 

God Alexa Fogel did great casting (and David Simon portraying) characters as chameleons. Everyone is impressionable but forgettable. Perfectly camouflaged.

Edit: Correct Fogey to Fogel
    I’m watching beyond the first few seasons of the walking dead when it first came out and I was real pleased to see some of The Wire guys together.
    Cutty being fairly major in The Expanse gives me the warm fuzzies.
    Love watching pre-wire Law and Order, half the cast alternately shows up as lawyers and/or criminals.
Been a fan since fringe, haven't seen the wire, but man, the feeling is the same, the fact he's in destiny makes the game that much cooler.
    The Wire is one of the best shows ever made.
        The Wire is one of the best shows I've ever seen, except, maybe Breaking Bad.
[deleted]
    You should watch Fringe as well.
        Fringe is my favourite show, no contest. It's so good. Also the only show I've ever bought on blu ray
            Came here to shoutout Fringe gang
    No spoilers, but 4 is where I generally question if I want to go through the whirlwind emotions that season and parts of 5 put you through.   Not because its not worth it, it just is heavy
Wire is great, Fringe he's great and fuck was he willing to go hard as balls on Eric Andre's show. That performance pretty much tops his others for how out of left field it was just still fucking amazing.
Charon in John Wick, especially 3
He was amazing in Quantum Break, and John Wick
He plays the character that looks exactly like him
    Literally one of the main characters lol
        Sylens
            Kwaiyet
            Name’s fitting.
        Honestly, I didn't put two and two together, but seeing someone say that they're the same person, I don't know how I didn't hear it before...
            Literally the first time he talks to Aloy through the Focus I was like "WHY IS ZAVALA IN MY EAR" lol
                Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Eclipse in Sunfall.
                Same! I was like wait hold up I am playing horizon not destiny??
Sylens, shows up a little ways into the main story
Also in the Duck Tales reboot, funnily enough as the leader of the moon people. He said one thing about the moon and I just knew.
    "Moon's haunted."

"Let's get dangerous!"
        WOO HOO
He plays Sylenz. He comes in fairly early on, at first he's just a voice talking over Aloy's focus earpiece thing.
Here: https://youtu.be/BaWa4ScfQXc
    I laugh hysterically without fail every time I see this video
He was perfect and he wasn't even a standout in the Wire because the entire cast of that show is so fucking dead-on it's insane. If anything I kinda think Andre Royo (Bubbles) was the most underrated actor in that show.
    Totally fucking agree. And of course, like the rest of the cast, he’s amazing in every role he’s played.
    Def not underrated, him and omar were my favorites though by far. Everyone loved bubbles though lol
I loved him in Fringe too. Probably one of my favorite actors that I honestly forget about far too often.
“I wish I were Lavar Burton” 

“Where’s my iconic slave role?”

“Eric, motherfucker.”

“FUCK ALL YALL, FUCK ALL YALL”

“WARP SPEED DON’T RAINBOW READ ME [REDACTED]”

“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”
    You forgot his best line: "You need a new desk."
    This is my favorite piece of television ever.
    Fuck I can here to post something along these lines. As soon as I saw his name this scene instantly flashed into my head
    Do yourself a favor and find Toys R Me. I piss myself laughing every damn time I see it.
Yeah that was one of the best things I've ever seen.
One of these days I need to get around to watching John Wick.
We are the claymore roomba
    Doomba
        ‘Claymore Doomba’ flair when.
            You rang?
    When do we get the titan exotic that's just a chest piece covered in claymores?
        I mean that’s basically what this season’s exotic was
        2023
Flair checks out
Odin is with us!
If they created a Titan helmet that said that I would never wear anything else, ever.
    I feel like a helmet with the decal "this side towards enemy" on the fathead  would tell you all you needed to know about titans all in one perfectly summed up sentence. I love teaming up with other titans. 

Edit: meant to say forehead but fathead fits the titan so it stays
That was true until Heavensward 

Alphinaud really got his shit pushed in now he treats us like a friend along with the other scions
Do I need to ask permission to save this post?!? If so.... please can I save your post... this is awesome!! Worthy of being re-watched more than once when the need arises
    Bruhh u can save any Reddit post u want. It’s ur choice u don’t need to ask anyone.
        [deleted]
            I’m sry u caught me in the act
        Yeah
    How lame can you be?? Just save the video who tf cares ffs
        Lmao fuck you! Better to fucking ask and be sure, seeing all these people on social media sharing shit, saving shit, than when they least expect getting fucked over by copyright and bullshit.

Or legal action. All because they didn’t have permission.

Never when that shits gonna fucking start on Reddit.

Get the fuck outta here with that “lame” bullshit. Better safe than sorry pal.
            awwwww someone's feelings are hurt :(
“And that completes the meme”
-levar burton
He was solid on Bosch.
[Indeed.](https://i.makeagif.com/media/6-14-2018/p4to3K.gif)
    “Zavala, wait-“

**”Die.”**
I was worried there.
I'm not sure if there's ever been a moment where a guest turned it around on Eric so well.  You can see in his eyes that he has no idea what Lance was doing.  It's incredible.
I remember hearing him in that quantum game with the time abilities and instantly though "zavala?"
Agent Broyles was S tier
right????
Yes he's actually a huge fan of the game
    IIRC he's a Warlock
        [deleted]
            *ANGRY YELLING THUNDERCRASH NOISES*
        Maybe if he complains to Bungie directly they'll stop nerfing Warlock subclasses into the ground.
        What? Heresy. Purge the infidels
            It gets worse, nathan fillion (caydes va) also plays a warlock
                It’s warlocks all the way down!
    Oh awesome
    Pretty sure that's the reason he's the big name that's still around. He seems to really love the game and community. Reddick is awesome.
*We'll Be Right Back*
I knew i recognized that voice !! thanks
    i watched 3 the other day and when he talked i was like holy shit it's Zavala, didnt notice the first two movies either.
omar coming yo
I guess if I had to pick one it would just be "my office"
Agent Dunham?
Eric said he was one of the few that actually took him and the cast by surprise. When he slams the desk Eric was clearly scared as shit for a second. That look was pure, "WTF are you about to do next?!?!"
As soon as you said Eric Andre show, that was all the context I needed to know that there is no context
You’ll prolly need to get them yourself, but you’ll get shitloads of karma if you do it
    Fuck the karma dude I just wanna do this cause it'll funny af
        RemindMe! 1 day
            Should've put it to 2 hours lol
        DO IT!!
            *oh, I will, trust me, my dude* 

Once i figure out how to download these videos and then merge the audio and that, it'll be *golden*

Uhh what's the command for the link to show up? Lol
                Oh. I just finished making a dub. Mine’s not really great quality though so I’ll post it on my account for you to see and if you think yours is better you should post yours so that way there aren’t two Zavala memes rolling around
                    Yeah, I'll post it regardless and with my meticulous editing style, the audio for me must match up and look and feel as if it's a true intro lol
Omg lol this was legit if only if it was in the game
