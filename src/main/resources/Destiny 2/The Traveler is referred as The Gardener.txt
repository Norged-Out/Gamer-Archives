[[The Traveler is referred as The Gardener]]





Guardians actually do need to eat to live.  There's lore on the Drifter describing how he and his crew die multiple times to the cold and to starvation.  Your Ghost can revive you of course,  however the Drifter goes on to say the hunger and fatigue don't go away.  

 Soundes like a miserable way to live tbh

 Edit: but the comic thingy is real neat
    Exos don't need to eat right?
        Physically no they don't,  but their mind disassociates with their body when they stop doing human-like things.  They end up with some Exo mind rejection stuff
            So what are they powered by then? I don't know much about exo lore sry.
                I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really known. Apparently, they‚Äôre so mechanically advanced that only Ghosts can comprehend their inner workings.
                    Even then, not a great ton, at least at one point. Felwinter was having issues with his Exo body early into his life after being resurrected and his Ghost, Felspring, had to get him to kill himself so she could repair and rebuild instead of what could've been done with more knowledge available, iirc.
                        I think that had to do with him being a mini Rasputin, the preparatory hardware and firmware was way too complex for the ghost to mess with, that's why it wanted Felwinter to blow his head out  


at least that's what I got from it, need to re-watch that video
                            It was absolutely to do with him being an Exo, cause he isn't a mini Rasputin. He is an exo that was under the influence of Rasputin.
                                No he is a seraph which is way advanced beyond an Exo. For one he‚Äôs most likely an AI and not a human brain mapped into a robot, and for two he is specifically built advanced to control warmind systems.

He‚Äôs an Exo like Mara is an awoken. Both are well beyond what the norm
                                    Yeah Mara cheated. Being the first awoken and a God among her own people has its privileges.
                            Proprietary?
                            ‚ÄúThe drone spun uneasily. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a Exo. Existing were made in the Golden Age, with proprietary tech. I can‚Äôt hack into your head to fix the damage, but I can rebuild you as you were. If you shot yourself, I could work quicker‚Äù‚Äù -Lore, Dusk and Dawn, The Liar, 2. THE BEGINNING, PART II.

Still he was just any old Exo, but Ghosts have an easier time making exact copies of physical hardware (matter) than hacking and understanding individual species coding? Also in the scentence before he said he was damaged in write-protected process so he would have to override those defenses then rewrite the cognition moduals. It‚Äôs all space magic.
                        That's basically my reaction to any minor inconvenience in Destiny.  Stubbed my toe?  Heavy brick fell of a cliff?  I'm just killing myself üòÇ
                            I wonder if guardians feel and remember the trauma and fear from each death or if ghost shelters us from the experience.
                                Guardians jumping to their death off the Tower is canon so either we're sheltered from the trauma or so desensitized to it that it's a valid form of entertainment
                                    I mean, if you knew you'd be okay afterwards, wouldn't you do shit like that just for funsies? I sure would.
                                In the lore entry about the guardian stuck on the almighty, the ghost says that they usually don‚Äôt have to wait for guardians to actually die before ‚Äúreviving‚Äù them. So probably usually spared the experience.
                                Some Warlocks, *Thanatonauts*, repeatedly commit suicide in an attempt to see the afterlife.
                                you just mentioning the game in the thread.
                                this is why I think being a Guardian would be absolute hell. An excruciating painful death, just to be brought back and expect to go through it again at least three more times before you even finish the mission.
                                    This is what the Drifter hates the light. He died a lot in his early days and many of them were violent deaths. So now he wants to do anything to avoid being killed and doesn‚Äôt have the rosy outlook on the Light most Guardians seem to have.
                        Wait, felwinter‚Äôs ghost is felspring? Where are felsummer and felfall?
                            Well that‚Äôs what he named his junk, so we don‚Äôt really talk about that
                            That's the name Felwinter gave his ghost, just thinking it was a neat little spin off of his name. 

Also, it would be Felautumn I think. Felfall sounds stupid lol
                            Did someone say felafal?
                        >had to get him to kill himself

We literally jump off of the tower for fun. "Getting" us guardians to kill ourselves is not a difficult task lol
                            It wasnt a problem for him to kill himself. It just goes to show that Felwinter had to be dead because so little knowledge was available on Exo's that Felspring couldnt work on him when he was alive.
                                Ah. Yeah i was just trying to make a dumb joke :p
                                    I got it :) dont worry
                    Ah. The good old science-y reason lol bungie. thank you.
                    Maybe we might learn more as we‚Äôll be going to the deep stone crypt this fall
                    Probably because the exos are based off Vex tech
                Hopes and dreams?  

 I've never found lore that describes how Exo bodies physically function,  but we know their bodies are 100% machine and that the minds where somehow transferred digitally to the Exo body. 

 As for food Cayde-6 actually has lore describing what eating is like for him.  He doesn't get hungry,  and he doesn't even taste,  dude just eats because he likes the mouth feel of certain foods.

(Past this point is speculation)  Personally I'm not even sure they feel they same as regular people do,  prolly just their circuitry sensing something is touching him and translating to his mind as a feel sensation
                    >prolly just their circuitry sensing something is touching him and translating to his mind as a feel sensation

Tbf, that's basically what happens with people but our circuits are juicier
                        Please dont describe nerves as juicy circuits
                            Our brains run on binary, because the Juiciest Circuits in our head fire in On/Off sequences
                    Wait Cayde couldn't taste? What about the Exo who could taste speeds?
                        no no, that's called drugs
                    I think at this point " type stuff
                At the core of every exo is a dilithium crystal immersed in flubber with a vibranium casing.
                    Oh. ISEE : -.    )
                I‚Äôm not quite sure but it could be in a similar way to the vex, if you go to a certain little vex structure on nessus as an exo character ghost will say something about how it‚Äôs similar to something about exos.
                    yup, I inspected the conflux yesterday and it said that it burned out because it came in contact with my exo body, implying a connection between Exos and Vex.
                I imagine they can break down water into hydrogen and oxygen and just use a mini fusion reactor. Safe clean energy that won't explode if something goes wrong.
                it is probably Golden Age biofuel being integrated within Exos. even more Complicated even with Lightbearer Exos.
                I think radiolaria (vex mind goop)
            The mind rejection stuff still happens after a guardian gets brought back from the dead? Does that mean Exo guardians have to go get reset or whatever and advance to the next number too?
                I've never seen any lore supporting that they don't.  I don't think the base physical limits of a person gets changed when they become a guardian,  seems even that they still age.
                    Alright cool. That makes sense. I wonder who resets them then and what will happen when our Exo guardians need to be reset.
                        One at a time. No wonder!
                    Iirc there's unreleased lore about exo warlock I think? going insane from too many deaths/suicides, could be related.
                At that point I think their mind knows that,to quote soldier, ‚Äú were not dieing, we are going to live forever‚Äù
                    oh Traveler, Soldier as a Guardian, I can hear the enemies of Man weeping from here
            I wish we had a DLC that would like expand lore more about Exos
                I think a little mystery is healthy for the game.
                    Yeah you right
                    first game was great cos of the mystery. combine the story of the second game and you‚Äôve got a mastahpiece
                Next fall DLC does have the Deep Stone Crypt, so maybe we will during one of the seasons?
                    I hope so, that is one of the most interesting things about destiny. Maybe even about the exo stranger
            Does that mean exist can fuck?
                Yes. Pretty widely known fact that they can, given that it‚Äôs a critical human function. Ikora had an exo boyfriend at one point, imagine what they got up to.
            Except DER was made up so are we sure they need to eat?
            that‚Äôs fucking interesting lol
            Exo schizophrenics..?
            Hence Cayde and his ramen
            [deleted]
                I'm gonna be honest chief.  I'm not sure I understand the meaning behind this comment
        They do eat. If you wished for Failsafe to narrate your Last Wish raid as an Exo, she'll comment - "Why do robots need to eat?" plus Cayde spent a LOT of glimmer on ramen {hence his photo is there)(and I suspect it's his Ramen vending machine near Zavala office)
        Ever since the great collapse humans have lost their greatest knowledge and technology.

Currently Omolon is the only group making tech anywhere near the shit humanity had at its zenith. 

Exos don't need food, and as far as we know they don't have any other power sources.

It's entirely possible that they're powered by an advanced energy source like a mini reactor, like the Master Chiefs armor in Halo. Spartan Amor has a mini nuclear reactor built in that powers the suit.

Given the advancements of the Golden Age, they might be powered for hundreds or thousands of years by a core. It might pose a problem later on in the future of the lore.

This is all speculation.
            >‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be worn.
            Huh. So if one day they run out of power, do ghosts just keep reviving them and then they keep dying?
                In Drifters lore his ghost said he could revive him without the hunger, but he told the ghost to fuck off. I would assume the same could be done for Exos even if the mechanism for it isn't clear.
        Are exos plants?
            Power plants.
                Exos are the powerhouses of the City
        Exo lore is super cool, definitely worth reading.
        I've seen Cayde-6 eat ramen before.
        Technically yes, they do. It's to prevent the mind from rejecting the body.
        "I just ate!" - Cayde-6 on Exodus Crash Strike, Nessus
        Yeah they're robots
    wait, didn't drifter died of hunger because he didn't trust his ghost and forbid him from "healing" him from hunger?
        Nahh,  it wasn't just the drifter anyway,  it was the whole squad dying and getting revived and dying again in a loop for years
            Theres a different lore book where the drifter first gets risen by his ghost and he keeps dying because he doesnt trust his ghost, long before the ice rock stuff.

Edit: the lore book is A Man With No Name: Dogma
    No, the drifter refused to be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù by his Ghost, he wouldn‚Äôt starve if he let him do it
    Slightly correct. Ghosts can fix starvation, Drifter just chose not to let his Ghost help him.
        They can stop you from dying of starvation. But you‚Äôre still hungry.
            That doesn't sound accurate, seeing as how Drifter specifically says "Ghost can cure starvation"
                Starvation as in dying of starvation. Not starvation as in having no food inside you. While Guardians can technically get away with not eating or sleeping, it‚Äôs not a pleasant experience and probably dangerous too. We know from indirect statements that Guardians don‚Äôt have an infinite amount of light. Repeated deaths, healings, super use, etc can leave them and their Ghosts drained. 

We know of one concrete consequence to this: longer and longer resurrection times. But it would make logical sense for this to all transfer to things like slower ‚Äúsuper recharge rate‚Äù slower healing, reduced power, etc. 

So while you could have Guardians deploying without food. They‚Äôd be hungry, irritable, weaker, and more vulnerable. 

As far as I can tell Guardians are effectively identical to normal humans/Exos/Awoken, with the sole exceptions of powers, resurrection, and healing. They still eat, drink, breathe, shit, and fuck. Exo Guardians might no longer suffer from DER, though we can‚Äôt be sure. And if they do they can probably fix it via death/resurrection rather than a reset.

EDIT: Forgot to mention an important part. Sleep is mentioned multiple times in the lore as something Guardians should do but can technically go without. Dredgen Yor had terrible insomnia, Shaxx mentions Thanatology as ‚Äúan excuse for insomnia‚Äù, Exos and Hunters are both noted as having trouble sleeping and that being framed as a bad thing, etc.
                    This is the correct answer. Yeah you can just get your Ghost to revive you when you keel over but that ain‚Äôt a life worth living. 

Drifter could only crawl he was so starved. When his Ghost reset him, he had the energy to sit back up but he still felt hungry. Who knows how long it was before he got a decent meal to eat?

Dying over and over only to come back feeling just as bad as before. Never once feeling ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòfull‚Äô. Guardians need to eat so they can maintain themselves and also not feel terrible.
        I don't think that's accurate. That wasn't my understanding of the lore anyway.
    Actually, and I could definitely be wrong, I believe Drifter insists on not having his hunger sated cause he really doesn‚Äôt trust his ghost
    Your ghost can cure your hunger.  The Drifter never let his do it.
        This is the right answer. His ghost says to him "I can cure your hunger you know?" And the Drifter says no even though he starves many times. I forget what lore card it is but it's in the main Drifter set.
        > tention

We‚Äôre about to die off hunger
    No guardians do not need to eat to live the drifter told his ghost not to do that for him as he didn't like being a guardian and would rather have something making him still feel human
    I believe in the lore it is stated that ghosts can cure hunger, but drifter didn't want to use the light as a crutch
    Drifter eventually developed an eating disorder and is now constantly hungry. That's why he keeps eating fallen and such
        The Fallen never ate babies, it was the Drifter all along ...
    I believe that‚Äôs why he hates the light. He was essentially constantly starving and realized how awful immortality is
        For a while, and only my car
        Kinda reminds me of Barbosa and the crew, from the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
        And this is why the darkness is our salvation
    Drifter himself says that Ghosts can cure starvation. P sure Drifter starved to death a lot just because he refused that kind of help from his Ghost.
    Yea, before getting attacked by Light-sucking creatures
    It was in the tape collecting thing
        Oh I gotcha
    Yeah, also.. plants need water
    The drifter specifically didn't let his ghost keep him from starving because not only does he not trust the light, he doesn't trust his ghost because of the shit his ghost told him.
    He‚Äôs permanently hungry/obsessed with food now and literally eats other species. He drinks vex milk and eats cabal meat.
    Actually the Drifter's ghost could of revived him full, but drifter wouldn't let him because he didn't trust it. 

 https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/dogma -- 
What the hell is wrong with me?" he demanded of the ground.

"You're dying from starvation," Ghost said flatly.

"I don't believe you," he sneered, as he dragged himself over some rocks.

"I could fix you," Ghost said.

"Don't need you," he said. "I got this."
    Ghosts are actually capable of reviving without hunger or thirst.

Drifter however is a dick to his ghost and when the ghost tried to tell him of this ability he told it to shut up.
    Guardians don‚Äôt have to eat, Ghosts can just sustain them. Drifter doesn‚Äôt eat because he‚Äôs a hardass.
    I thought the ghost can do some space magic to make you not need food, but the drifter rejected that?
    Does the Drifter still have his Ghost?
        Yes
    I think that in Drifter's lore his ghost says it can fix his hunger when he's starving to death, and he refuses.
    Well I believe in the same Lore book his ghost said ‚ÄúI can fix you‚Äù meaning he could use the light to give him energy before he died instead of reviving after starving to death. The drifter being the Bastard he is always refused and would rather starve to death than rely on his ghost. So pretty sure we don‚Äôt have to eat. But still can.
    One of my favorite lore pieces. It also says somewhere that guardians also suffer from radiation and how some would need to die due to it and be resurrected multiple times. Also the gun gnawing hunger is a good reference to the way some guardians in the drifters crew probably felt a lot. Lol
    *That's* his experience. but Not all Lightbearers/Risen beings share this universal contradiction of Guardian biology. There are some mentions of them but I can't tell anymore.

the Light within a Guardian & a Ghost can be flexible depending....
    So yeah, about that. I just played a match of gambit prime and before the match Drifter said: "Ghost can cure starvation. But if you got hive, why starve?" 

That is in my opinion pretty definite proof that guardians don't need to eat (or drink, propably).

Proof for sceptics: [https://youtu.be/kjFuDb2ZUzE?t=216](https://youtu.be/kjFuDb2ZUzE?t=216) (video by Chezvii)
    More proof: the lore book that describes saint 14 and osiris having a conversation under the traveller is the dark age, the ate and talked about how the city will be a beacon
    The ghosts can make you not hungry though, Drifter just didn't let his ghost do that.
    Ghosts can actually cure hunger and fatigue, Drifter just asked his Ghost not to because he was always upset that dying and being revived wasn't enough to stop life's sufferings.
        The rest of his crew were also hungry. It can heal the damage caused by starvation, but it can‚Äôt magic food into your belly.
            That was on the ice planet, where the Light was muted (so they couldn't be cured of their starvation on top of there being no food).
                They could be cured of death most of the time. There‚Äôs no reason it couldn‚Äôt also cure their starvation if it was normally capable of it. 

Being hungry isn‚Äôt an injury. The Ghost can heal imjury, heal fatigue induced damage, but it can‚Äôt make you feel rested or full. 

Drifter is paranoid, but he‚Äôs not so stupid as to let himself feel starving without a choice. He let himself die from it, possibly because it made him feel slightly less hungry than living with it, but mostly due to the principle of it.

They need food tho
     just like plants cause they need fertilizer.




(or maybe they don't im not an expert at plants)
        They dont NEED it but it helps
            Just like guardians
                Exactly
            Plants do need nutrients to survive. If you aren't fertilizing, they're still getting nutrients from the soil. Plants that grow in nutrient poor soil have other ways around this. Carnivorous plants, for example, do sort of have to eat.
                The ‚Äúgrenade‚Äù (firework) doesn‚Äôt eat anything
                    Is that a plant? What's the genus and species? I'm interested.
                    And Warlocks eat grenades.
                        I thought that was just Titans, mistaking them for crayons
        Plants will do fine without fertilizer in proper soil. If not I‚Äôm good soil fertilizer is needed
Don't know about your Guardian, but mine eats at the Spicy Ramen shop all of the time!
    He eats the souls of the Hive. (He's a Warlock, so it's acceptable.)
    I hope you are a hunter or warlock
    I hope you are a hunter or warlock
Based on a silly thought I had while playing yesterday.
    Not sure how many will see this but there are so many comment about these so I want to address couple of things. 

Firstly, I know plants need water and nutriens too but I glossed it over for the sake of the joke. And who knows, maybe this specific guardian didn't know that.

Secondly, before making this I was under the impression guardians don't NEED need to eat, drink or sleep but of course it would be beneficial to them. In the book "a man with no name"/entry 'Dogma' it is implied ghosts could "take away" hunger which would most propably apply to thrist as well, and in "The Liar"/entry 'The beginning, part II' Felwinter asks from his ghost how will he sleep and his ghost answers he doesn't need to which I took that as no guardian needs to sleep, only later realising it was propably because Felwinter was an exo. That being said in my experience the lore isn't always unanimous in these things and quite many things are left unclear.

Any way, as I'm writing this the post has almost 15k upvotes, likes or whatever they're called in here, way more than the hundred or so I expected. THANK YOU to all of you.
Ok, I did some digging because I wasn't exactly sure myself. Drifter's story about his past talks only about him and his crew freezing to death, nothing about starvation that I could find.

In the book "a man with no name" (a book presumably about drifter) speaks how the person refuses the ghost's help when he is starving: [https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/dogma#book-a-man-with-no-name](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/dogma#book-a-man-with-no-name). The line ' "I could fix you," Ghost said. ' in my opinion implies ghosts can in fact "take away" hunger.
    On one of his tapes on earth he does say he died of hunger only to be rezzed by his ghost, still hungry
        That's because in the lore book, Drifter refuses to let his ghost make him not starving.
    Wait, if it wasn't Eli, then who was the Guardian who repeatedly starves himself to death?
        it was Eli. drifter has had a lot of names
We are the powerhouse of the Tower.
    The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.
The warlock has learned too much
Didn't Drifter die of starvation, and was rezzed a few times by his ghost?
    He was rezzed, still hungry, and still had fatique, what an agonizing way to live.
    He didn't let his Ghost cure his hunger
Hey piccolo!  Are you...a Yoshi?
    Reference: [Dragon Ball Z Abridged: Episode 1](https://youtu.be/2nYozPLpJRE)

Watching the first one, it‚Äôs impressive how far TFS has come.
For all non-warlocks out there, this what our ghosts have to deal with in a daily basis.
I've been trying to get the damn Ego Talon gauntlets for so long.
    are there ego talon pants? i have everything besides pants
        Yes.
Now this is warlock level stuff
    Dont worry I'm a warlock first titan second
Also as a secondary thought to all the food side posts. 

Guardians do sleep. Exos even. While most of them do report all having the same dream, exos do dream. Meaning all their counter parts would need to sleep as well. Especially humans and awoken.
    She thought she was going for a shite.
*Or are we dancers?*
    You are magnificent.
The ghost looks so done with the guardian‚Äôs shit even without having a face to express that
I noticed the Ghost now talks for the Guardian. Has anyone else noticed this? When it comes to communication. Seems the Guardian is all brawns now while the Ghost is brains and voice
    This has been the case since post D1 launch. That's why it was a big deal when the Guardian spoke in Forsaken.
        I agree
    We only talk if something is personal or deeply affected by it
We're space zombies.
    We're coming out of her chest.
        sorry for ruining the chain but uh, **wha**
When we warlocks meditate, we're actually photosynthesizing.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre harvesting guardians‚Äù -ghost
    They lost 15 goddamn guardians to one strike
        It was a raid before we arrived, with an invulnerable boss with no way to weaken it.

Them dying, and giving us a way to damage the boss, turned it into a strike.
            Well didnt it need the guardian Crystal's to become immune?
                No, we needed those to make it become vulnerable.

They were harvesting the crystals to try to empower savathun.

Holy shit...

#We are aren't we?
Yes, Guardian, you're a beautiful flower.
Obligatory PRAISE THE SUN!!!
I know a couple that seem like vegetables
But plants need water.... ?
If I had to be a plant I would choose to be a pot plant
My teammates certainly are vegetables with the way they're playing. Im in favour of this theory.
Both guardians and plants need all of those things though...

Drifter always complains about being hungry and if you don't water your flowers they die.
Fuxk this makes to much sense, head is about to explode with too much information.
So that's what M. Night meant
He‚Äôs too dangerous to be kept alive
That would explain so much about Tess

Oh wait, she's not a guardian nevermind....

    Hey, hey Luis! I‚Äôm a plant, Luis!
Plants... Violent plants.
Plants need oxygen
    Im pretty sure all the planets have oxygen since the traveler terraformed them
I‚Äôm the ultimate guardian
WTF I‚Äôm like.. the shower is quicker???????

Plants need water dude
Plants definitely eat, I spend enough on plant food, trust me!
Yes. Sunlight.
True, I have not played Octopath Traveler.
Sons of liches
This may come as a fighter.
So, we are gardens?
So, is Vash the stampede a gaurdian?
I mean this is a valid point bc the traveler really just cultivated Sol so yes he 'traveled' to it but like. Gardener really hits hard
I do like to think of my Guardian as Vash the Stampede sometimes...
    This. This 100%.
The titans are plants that‚Äôs for sure
‚ÄòVash, The Stampede‚Äô was the original Guardian, Guardians.
Brilliant.
After seeing trailer of new dlc I think we can not only eat light, but also darkness
Gardener, can confirm this as well
Gardener, can confirm thats me in the feels!
Now that's a great theory
Photosynthesis motherfu**er
Gardener, can confirm thats me in the heart.
Gardener, can confirm, as I am!
Vegetarian guardians shriek is they realize they are cannibals.
Plants do need water and other nutrients from the ground.
Gardener, can confirm.

Not a real whale
Gardener, can confirm thats me in the feels
We do need food, its just very horrible if you don't eat, "and when we would starve, Ghost would bring us back, still hungry."
The perfect meme for it
Just like Vash and Knives huh? 

Well no not really
Gardener, can confirm that is accurate
LOVE IT!
i love how annoyed the Ghost is on the last panel, he's just like "of all the people i chose as my Guardian i chose you...".
The half lidded ghost shell eye at the end has to be my favorite part.
Gardener, can confirm this is not normal behavior.
Yeah but plants eat drink and sleep
Gardener, can confirm thats me in the pic?
The scenario you‚Äôre grabbing him.
** You haven‚Äôt played Octopath Traveler
Sounds more like the vampires from Twilight

Guardians do actually need everything they normally would
Forbidden salad
We are dead since Forsaken DLC.
They eat and live a normal life on the ship while we are not playing, duh
Not sure how many will see this but there are so many comment about these so I want to address couple of things.

Firstly,  I know plants need water and nutriens too but I glossed it over for the  sake of the joke. This was based on a silly, fleeting though and I didn't think about it too hard. And who knows, maybe this specific guardian didn't  know that.

Secondly, before making  this I was under the impression guardians don't NEED need to eat, drink or sleep but of course it would be beneficial to them. In the book "a  man with no name"/entry 'Dogma' it is implied ghosts could "take away"  hunger which would most propably apply to thrist as well, and in "The  Liar"/entry 'The beginning, part II' Felwinter asks from his ghost how will he sleep and his ghost answers he doesn't need to which I took that  as no guardian needs to sleep, only later realising it was propably because Felwinter was an exo. That being said in my experience the lore  isn't always unanimous in these things and quite many things are left  unclear.

Any way, as I'm writing  this the post has almost 15k upvotes, likes or whatever they're called  in here, way more than the hundred or so I expected. THANK YOU to all of  you.

edit: 10 minutes later 15k upvotes reached.
They are eating, drinking, and sleeping when we are not playong
Nice
I forgot plants don‚Äôt need water
I dunno mate. I‚Äôm just your average crayon eater I don‚Äôt have much time to think about things.
Fuck yeah! I‚Äôm a goddamn rose!! ~~cause when people get near me I stab them~~
Well technically guardians do need to eat and sleep (awoken and humans) as mentioned by the drifter as he had died many times from starvation, but Exos......Exos are 100% plant 70% of the time
    Exos need the same things, otherwise their bodies will get rejected and they die
        Yes but it's a mind thing and not an actual body thing. If a human or awoken starve, they lose body mass and strength, while an EXO might go full mental breakdown  but we dont know if a ghost can fix that. Imagine you rez an exo guardian just for it to brick itself because it refused to sleep, eat or drink and you had no fix to the situation
During Trials I consider myself more of a ‚Äòsuckulent‚Äô. 


I‚Äôll see myself out.
Well the Traveler IS the Gardener supposedly ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The traveler is also called the gardener...



Well shit.
Ghost with the "I'm done" look in the last panel
The ghost looks like me in the end.
Eris must be a moon lilly
‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE A PLANT‚Äù

Ghost replies, 

*"Well, the Unveiling book did refer the Traveller as, "The Gardener". So....."*

Ghost joyfully sprinkles "light" out of a holographic watering can on the helmet.
Yes.
But plants do eat and drink
So basically all vash the stampede
Y E S
Can confirm. Im definitely a vegetable
Plants need to eat and drink tho
Both guardians and plants need to drink
Got a sleeping plant
destiny will probably spin it and say we are the traveler looking for a good story and something to do, and the guardian is an example of how we have grown whilst we played destiny, they are the plant we started growing when we first played
I mean... we always somehow recover ‚Äúseeds‚Äù of light.
*metaphorical*, Guardian-players. **\[*****Metaphorical*****\]**. \[sighed\]
Plants eat, drink and sleep tho...
Dude got baby hands
Bruh moment.
Oh yeah, I'd forgotten all about the traveler. The game was initially teased about a cataclysm and survivors rescued by a mysterious and wise entity. Meanwhile, we just get a bunch of hard to kill aliens from The Fifth Element and no relatable plot and a giant mystery box when it comes to The Traveler. At least with Halo, it was relatable. There was a goal to fight for, to save Humanity from the Covenant or the flood or the Didact. There's so many enemies in Destiny, that it just becomes shoot the bad guys, do the same thing over and over again, no relatable characters, not since Cayde died. If it wasn't one of the best mechanics shooters ever, I would have quit a long time ago due to the lackluster story. A story needs relatable and understandable characters. A sense of purpose towards a goal, with a chance at Hope of success, not working really hard for 10 years, and then losing all of our hard-earned weapons and gear, only to have to start The Grind from scratch, just to get the same weapons over again. Fuck that.
Interesting to think that the light from the traveler grew trees in the forsaken quest for our new supers and the pyramid is doing the same in the cradle. The only difference is that the tree of light is organic and the tree of dark is metallic.
**YES**
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Plants need water tho
You have uncovered bungie‚Äôs plan all along, THIS IS JUST A NEW PVZ GAME!
It could technically be true
I mean, you dont need food if you enjoy starving to death every 3 weeks.
Gurdians actually need to eat and drink, the drifter starved to death many times in his past, he got mad that he revived always hungry, but that dosent change the fact that we need light, so we are still plants.
I love how people are keen to point out how guardians do apparently need to eat and drink.

I have yet to see someone point out plants need water. And nutrients.

Y'all need to go outside.
r/OhFuck

r/BigBrainTime
Vash the Stampede has entered the chat
Thats like asking if a piece of cardboard is a robot.

And the answer is yes.
I‚Äôm learning more about the lore from this post‚Äôs comments then from the game itself
Who says they dont need food or sleep. Pretty sure one of drifters lore pieces says he starved to death multiple times hiding from other guardians in the dark age.
Guardians do need to eat and sleep..
Oh my goodness never made that connection
Exos don't need to eat right?
    Physically no they don't,  but their mind disassociates with their body when they stop doing human-like things.  They end up with some Exo mind rejection stuff
        So what are they powered by then? I don't know much about exo lore sry.
            I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really known. Apparently, they‚Äôre so mechanically advanced that only Ghosts can comprehend their inner workings.
                Even then, not a great ton, at least at one point. Felwinter was having issues with his Exo body early into his life after being resurrected and his Ghost, Felspring, had to get him to kill himself so she could repair and rebuild instead of what could've been done with more knowledge available, iirc.
                    I think that had to do with him being a mini Rasputin, the preparatory hardware and firmware was way too complex for the ghost to mess with, that's why it wanted Felwinter to blow his head out  


at least that's what I got from it, need to re-watch that video
                        It was absolutely to do with him being an Exo, cause he isn't a mini Rasputin. He is an exo that was under the influence of Rasputin.
                            No he is a seraph which is way advanced beyond an Exo. For one he‚Äôs most likely an AI and not a human brain mapped into a robot, and for two he is specifically built advanced to control warmind systems.

He‚Äôs an Exo like Mara is an awoken. Both are well beyond what the norm
                                Yeah Mara cheated. Being the first awoken and a God among her own people has its privileges.
                        Proprietary?
                        ‚ÄúThe drone spun uneasily. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a Exo. Existing were made in the Golden Age, with proprietary tech. I can‚Äôt hack into your head to fix the damage, but I can rebuild you as you were. If you shot yourself, I could work quicker‚Äù‚Äù -Lore, Dusk and Dawn, The Liar, 2. THE BEGINNING, PART II.

Still he was just any old Exo, but Ghosts have an easier time making exact copies of physical hardware (matter) than hacking and understanding individual species coding? Also in the scentence before he said he was damaged in write-protected process so he would have to override those defenses then rewrite the cognition moduals. It‚Äôs all space magic.
                    That's basically my reaction to any minor inconvenience in Destiny.  Stubbed my toe?  Heavy brick fell of a cliff?  I'm just killing myself üòÇ
                        I wonder if guardians feel and remember the trauma and fear from each death or if ghost shelters us from the experience.
                            Guardians jumping to their death off the Tower is canon so either we're sheltered from the trauma or so desensitized to it that it's a valid form of entertainment
                                I mean, if you knew you'd be okay afterwards, wouldn't you do shit like that just for funsies? I sure would.
                            In the lore entry about the guardian stuck on the almighty, the ghost says that they usually don‚Äôt have to wait for guardians to actually die before ‚Äúreviving‚Äù them. So probably usually spared the experience.
                            Some Warlocks, *Thanatonauts*, repeatedly commit suicide in an attempt to see the afterlife.
                            you just mentioning the game in the thread.
                            this is why I think being a Guardian would be absolute hell. An excruciating painful death, just to be brought back and expect to go through it again at least three more times before you even finish the mission.
                                This is what the Drifter hates the light. He died a lot in his early days and many of them were violent deaths. So now he wants to do anything to avoid being killed and doesn‚Äôt have the rosy outlook on the Light most Guardians seem to have.
                    Wait, felwinter‚Äôs ghost is felspring? Where are felsummer and felfall?
                        Well that‚Äôs what he named his junk, so we don‚Äôt really talk about that
                        That's the name Felwinter gave his ghost, just thinking it was a neat little spin off of his name. 

Also, it would be Felautumn I think. Felfall sounds stupid lol
                        Did someone say felafal?
                    >had to get him to kill himself

We literally jump off of the tower for fun. "Getting" us guardians to kill ourselves is not a difficult task lol
                        It wasnt a problem for him to kill himself. It just goes to show that Felwinter had to be dead because so little knowledge was available on Exo's that Felspring couldnt work on him when he was alive.
                            Ah. Yeah i was just trying to make a dumb joke :p
                                I got it :) dont worry
                Ah. The good old science-y reason lol bungie. thank you.
                Maybe we might learn more as we‚Äôll be going to the deep stone crypt this fall
                Probably because the exos are based off Vex tech
            Hopes and dreams?  

 I've never found lore that describes how Exo bodies physically function,  but we know their bodies are 100% machine and that the minds where somehow transferred digitally to the Exo body. 

 As for food Cayde-6 actually has lore describing what eating is like for him.  He doesn't get hungry,  and he doesn't even taste,  dude just eats because he likes the mouth feel of certain foods.

(Past this point is speculation)  Personally I'm not even sure they feel they same as regular people do,  prolly just their circuitry sensing something is touching him and translating to his mind as a feel sensation
                >prolly just their circuitry sensing something is touching him and translating to his mind as a feel sensation

Tbf, that's basically what happens with people but our circuits are juicier
                    Please dont describe nerves as juicy circuits
                        Our brains run on binary, because the Juiciest Circuits in our head fire in On/Off sequences
                Wait Cayde couldn't taste? What about the Exo who could taste speeds?
                    no no, that's called drugs
                I think at this point " type stuff
            At the core of every exo is a dilithium crystal immersed in flubber with a vibranium casing.
                Oh. ISEE : -.    )
            I‚Äôm not quite sure but it could be in a similar way to the vex, if you go to a certain little vex structure on nessus as an exo character ghost will say something about how it‚Äôs similar to something about exos.
                yup, I inspected the conflux yesterday and it said that it burned out because it came in contact with my exo body, implying a connection between Exos and Vex.
            I imagine they can break down water into hydrogen and oxygen and just use a mini fusion reactor. Safe clean energy that won't explode if something goes wrong.
            it is probably Golden Age biofuel being integrated within Exos. even more Complicated even with Lightbearer Exos.
            I think radiolaria (vex mind goop)
        The mind rejection stuff still happens after a guardian gets brought back from the dead? Does that mean Exo guardians have to go get reset or whatever and advance to the next number too?
            I've never seen any lore supporting that they don't.  I don't think the base physical limits of a person gets changed when they become a guardian,  seems even that they still age.
                Alright cool. That makes sense. I wonder who resets them then and what will happen when our Exo guardians need to be reset.
                    One at a time. No wonder!
                Iirc there's unreleased lore about exo warlock I think? going insane from too many deaths/suicides, could be related.
            At that point I think their mind knows that,to quote soldier, ‚Äú were not dieing, we are going to live forever‚Äù
                oh Traveler, Soldier as a Guardian, I can hear the enemies of Man weeping from here
        I wish we had a DLC that would like expand lore more about Exos
            I think a little mystery is healthy for the game.
                Yeah you right
                first game was great cos of the mystery. combine the story of the second game and you‚Äôve got a mastahpiece
            Next fall DLC does have the Deep Stone Crypt, so maybe we will during one of the seasons?
                I hope so, that is one of the most interesting things about destiny. Maybe even about the exo stranger
        Does that mean exist can fuck?
            Yes. Pretty widely known fact that they can, given that it‚Äôs a critical human function. Ikora had an exo boyfriend at one point, imagine what they got up to.
        Except DER was made up so are we sure they need to eat?
        that‚Äôs fucking interesting lol
        Exo schizophrenics..?
        Hence Cayde and his ramen
        [deleted]
            I'm gonna be honest chief.  I'm not sure I understand the meaning behind this comment
    They do eat. If you wished for Failsafe to narrate your Last Wish raid as an Exo, she'll comment - "Why do robots need to eat?" plus Cayde spent a LOT of glimmer on ramen {hence his photo is there)(and I suspect it's his Ramen vending machine near Zavala office)
    Ever since the great collapse humans have lost their greatest knowledge and technology.

Currently Omolon is the only group making tech anywhere near the shit humanity had at its zenith. 

Exos don't need food, and as far as we know they don't have any other power sources.

It's entirely possible that they're powered by an advanced energy source like a mini reactor, like the Master Chiefs armor in Halo. Spartan Amor has a mini nuclear reactor built in that powers the suit.

Given the advancements of the Golden Age, they might be powered for hundreds or thousands of years by a core. It might pose a problem later on in the future of the lore.

This is all speculation.
        >‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be worn.
        Huh. So if one day they run out of power, do ghosts just keep reviving them and then they keep dying?
            In Drifters lore his ghost said he could revive him without the hunger, but he told the ghost to fuck off. I would assume the same could be done for Exos even if the mechanism for it isn't clear.
    Are exos plants?
        Power plants.
            Exos are the powerhouses of the City
    Exo lore is super cool, definitely worth reading.
    I've seen Cayde-6 eat ramen before.
    Technically yes, they do. It's to prevent the mind from rejecting the body.
    "I just ate!" - Cayde-6 on Exodus Crash Strike, Nessus
    Yeah they're robots
wait, didn't drifter died of hunger because he didn't trust his ghost and forbid him from "healing" him from hunger?
    Nahh,  it wasn't just the drifter anyway,  it was the whole squad dying and getting revived and dying again in a loop for years
        Theres a different lore book where the drifter first gets risen by his ghost and he keeps dying because he doesnt trust his ghost, long before the ice rock stuff.

Edit: the lore book is A Man With No Name: Dogma
No, the drifter refused to be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù by his Ghost, he wouldn‚Äôt starve if he let him do it
Slightly correct. Ghosts can fix starvation, Drifter just chose not to let his Ghost help him.
    They can stop you from dying of starvation. But you‚Äôre still hungry.
        That doesn't sound accurate, seeing as how Drifter specifically says "Ghost can cure starvation"
            Starvation as in dying of starvation. Not starvation as in having no food inside you. While Guardians can technically get away with not eating or sleeping, it‚Äôs not a pleasant experience and probably dangerous too. We know from indirect statements that Guardians don‚Äôt have an infinite amount of light. Repeated deaths, healings, super use, etc can leave them and their Ghosts drained. 

We know of one concrete consequence to this: longer and longer resurrection times. But it would make logical sense for this to all transfer to things like slower ‚Äúsuper recharge rate‚Äù slower healing, reduced power, etc. 

So while you could have Guardians deploying without food. They‚Äôd be hungry, irritable, weaker, and more vulnerable. 

As far as I can tell Guardians are effectively identical to normal humans/Exos/Awoken, with the sole exceptions of powers, resurrection, and healing. They still eat, drink, breathe, shit, and fuck. Exo Guardians might no longer suffer from DER, though we can‚Äôt be sure. And if they do they can probably fix it via death/resurrection rather than a reset.

EDIT: Forgot to mention an important part. Sleep is mentioned multiple times in the lore as something Guardians should do but can technically go without. Dredgen Yor had terrible insomnia, Shaxx mentions Thanatology as ‚Äúan excuse for insomnia‚Äù, Exos and Hunters are both noted as having trouble sleeping and that being framed as a bad thing, etc.
                This is the correct answer. Yeah you can just get your Ghost to revive you when you keel over but that ain‚Äôt a life worth living. 

Drifter could only crawl he was so starved. When his Ghost reset him, he had the energy to sit back up but he still felt hungry. Who knows how long it was before he got a decent meal to eat?

Dying over and over only to come back feeling just as bad as before. Never once feeling ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòfull‚Äô. Guardians need to eat so they can maintain themselves and also not feel terrible.
    I don't think that's accurate. That wasn't my understanding of the lore anyway.
Actually, and I could definitely be wrong, I believe Drifter insists on not having his hunger sated cause he really doesn‚Äôt trust his ghost
Your ghost can cure your hunger.  The Drifter never let his do it.
    This is the right answer. His ghost says to him "I can cure your hunger you know?" And the Drifter says no even though he starves many times. I forget what lore card it is but it's in the main Drifter set.
    > tention

We‚Äôre about to die off hunger
No guardians do not need to eat to live the drifter told his ghost not to do that for him as he didn't like being a guardian and would rather have something making him still feel human
I believe in the lore it is stated that ghosts can cure hunger, but drifter didn't want to use the light as a crutch
Drifter eventually developed an eating disorder and is now constantly hungry. That's why he keeps eating fallen and such
    The Fallen never ate babies, it was the Drifter all along ...
I believe that‚Äôs why he hates the light. He was essentially constantly starving and realized how awful immortality is
    For a while, and only my car
    Kinda reminds me of Barbosa and the crew, from the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
    And this is why the darkness is our salvation
Drifter himself says that Ghosts can cure starvation. P sure Drifter starved to death a lot just because he refused that kind of help from his Ghost.
Yea, before getting attacked by Light-sucking creatures
It was in the tape collecting thing
    Oh I gotcha
Yeah, also.. plants need water
The drifter specifically didn't let his ghost keep him from starving because not only does he not trust the light, he doesn't trust his ghost because of the shit his ghost told him.
He‚Äôs permanently hungry/obsessed with food now and literally eats other species. He drinks vex milk and eats cabal meat.
Actually the Drifter's ghost could of revived him full, but drifter wouldn't let him because he didn't trust it. 

 https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/dogma -- 
What the hell is wrong with me?" he demanded of the ground.

"You're dying from starvation," Ghost said flatly.

"I don't believe you," he sneered, as he dragged himself over some rocks.

"I could fix you," Ghost said.

"Don't need you," he said. "I got this."
Ghosts are actually capable of reviving without hunger or thirst.

Drifter however is a dick to his ghost and when the ghost tried to tell him of this ability he told it to shut up.
Guardians don‚Äôt have to eat, Ghosts can just sustain them. Drifter doesn‚Äôt eat because he‚Äôs a hardass.
I thought the ghost can do some space magic to make you not need food, but the drifter rejected that?
Does the Drifter still have his Ghost?
    Yes
I think that in Drifter's lore his ghost says it can fix his hunger when he's starving to death, and he refuses.
Well I believe in the same Lore book his ghost said ‚ÄúI can fix you‚Äù meaning he could use the light to give him energy before he died instead of reviving after starving to death. The drifter being the Bastard he is always refused and would rather starve to death than rely on his ghost. So pretty sure we don‚Äôt have to eat. But still can.
One of my favorite lore pieces. It also says somewhere that guardians also suffer from radiation and how some would need to die due to it and be resurrected multiple times. Also the gun gnawing hunger is a good reference to the way some guardians in the drifters crew probably felt a lot. Lol
*That's* his experience. but Not all Lightbearers/Risen beings share this universal contradiction of Guardian biology. There are some mentions of them but I can't tell anymore.

the Light within a Guardian & a Ghost can be flexible depending....
So yeah, about that. I just played a match of gambit prime and before the match Drifter said: "Ghost can cure starvation. But if you got hive, why starve?" 

That is in my opinion pretty definite proof that guardians don't need to eat (or drink, propably).

Proof for sceptics: [https://youtu.be/kjFuDb2ZUzE?t=216](https://youtu.be/kjFuDb2ZUzE?t=216) (video by Chezvii)
More proof: the lore book that describes saint 14 and osiris having a conversation under the traveller is the dark age, the ate and talked about how the city will be a beacon
The ghosts can make you not hungry though, Drifter just didn't let his ghost do that.
Ghosts can actually cure hunger and fatigue, Drifter just asked his Ghost not to because he was always upset that dying and being revived wasn't enough to stop life's sufferings.
    The rest of his crew were also hungry. It can heal the damage caused by starvation, but it can‚Äôt magic food into your belly.
        That was on the ice planet, where the Light was muted (so they couldn't be cured of their starvation on top of there being no food).
            They could be cured of death most of the time. There‚Äôs no reason it couldn‚Äôt also cure their starvation if it was normally capable of it. 

Being hungry isn‚Äôt an injury. The Ghost can heal imjury, heal fatigue induced damage, but it can‚Äôt make you feel rested or full. 

Drifter is paranoid, but he‚Äôs not so stupid as to let himself feel starving without a choice. He let himself die from it, possibly because it made him feel slightly less hungry than living with it, but mostly due to the principle of it.
Happy Cake Day!
PHOTOSYNTHESIS!!
Happy photosynthesis day!
 just like plants cause they need fertilizer.




(or maybe they don't im not an expert at plants)
    They dont NEED it but it helps
        Just like guardians
            Exactly
        Plants do need nutrients to survive. If you aren't fertilizing, they're still getting nutrients from the soil. Plants that grow in nutrient poor soil have other ways around this. Carnivorous plants, for example, do sort of have to eat.
            The ‚Äúgrenade‚Äù (firework) doesn‚Äôt eat anything

I hope you are a hunter or warlock
Not sure how many will see this but there are so many comment about these so I want to address couple of things. 

Firstly, I know plants need water and nutriens too but I glossed it over for the sake of the joke. And who knows, maybe this specific guardian didn't know that.

Secondly, before making this I was under the impression guardians don't NEED need to eat, drink or sleep but of course it would be beneficial to them. In the book "a man with no name"/entry 'Dogma' it is implied ghosts could "take away" hunger which would most propably apply to thrist as well, and in "The Liar"/entry 'The beginning, part II' Felwinter asks from his ghost how will he sleep and his ghost answers he doesn't need to which I took that as no guardian needs to sleep, only later realising it was propably because Felwinter was an exo. That being said in my experience the lore isn't always unanimous in these things and quite many things are left unclear.

Any way, as I'm writing this the post has almost 15k upvotes, likes or whatever they're called in here, way more than the hundred or so I expected. THANK YOU to all of you.
On one of his tapes on earth he does say he died of hunger only to be rezzed by his ghost, still hungry
    That's because in the lore book, Drifter refuses to let his ghost make him not starving.
Wait, if it wasn't Eli, then who was the Guardian who repeatedly starves himself to death?
    it was Eli. drifter has had a lot of names
The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.
He was rezzed, still hungry, and still had fatique, what an agonizing way to live.
He didn't let his Ghost cure his hunger

Watching the first one, it‚Äôs impressive how far TFS has come.
are there ego talon pants? i have everything besides pants
    Yes.
Dont worry I'm a warlock first titan second
She thought she was going for a shite.
You are magnificent.
This has been the case since post D1 launch. That's why it was a big deal when the Guardian spoke in Forsaken.
    I agree
We only talk if something is personal or deeply affected by it
We're coming out of her chest.
    sorry for ruining the chain but uh, **wha**
They lost 15 goddamn guardians to one strike
    It was a raid before we arrived, with an invulnerable boss with no way to weaken it.

Them dying, and giving us a way to damage the boss, turned it into a strike.
        Well didnt it need the guardian Crystal's to become immune?
            No, we needed those to make it become vulnerable.

They were harvesting the crystals to try to empower savathun.
But she does get her items from a guardian.

Exos need the same things, otherwise their bodies will get rejected and they die
    Yes but it's a mind thing and not an actual body thing. If a human or awoken starve, they lose body mass and strength, while an EXO might go full mental breakdown  but we dont know if a ghost can fix that. Imagine you rez an exo guardian just for it to brick itself because it refused to sleep, eat or drink and you had no fix to the situation
Physically no they don't,  but their mind disassociates with their body when they stop doing human-like things.  They end up with some Exo mind rejection stuff
    So what are they powered by then? I don't know much about exo lore sry.
        I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really known. Apparently, they‚Äôre so mechanically advanced that only Ghosts can comprehend their inner workings.
            Even then, not a great ton, at least at one point. Felwinter was having issues with his Exo body early into his life after being resurrected and his Ghost, Felspring, had to get him to kill himself so she could repair and rebuild instead of what could've been done with more knowledge available, iirc.
                I think that had to do with him being a mini Rasputin, the preparatory hardware and firmware was way too complex for the ghost to mess with, that's why it wanted Felwinter to blow his head out  


at least that's what I got from it, need to re-watch that video
                    It was absolutely to do with him being an Exo, cause he isn't a mini Rasputin. He is an exo that was under the influence of Rasputin.
                        No he is a seraph which is way advanced beyond an Exo. For one he‚Äôs most likely an AI and not a human brain mapped into a robot, and for two he is specifically built advanced to control warmind systems.

He‚Äôs an Exo like Mara is an awoken. Both are well beyond what the norm
                            Yeah Mara cheated. Being the first awoken and a God among her own people has its privileges.
                    Proprietary?
                    ‚ÄúThe drone spun uneasily. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a Exo. Existing were made in the Golden Age, with proprietary tech. I can‚Äôt hack into your head to fix the damage, but I can rebuild you as you were. If you shot yourself, I could work quicker‚Äù‚Äù -Lore, Dusk and Dawn, The Liar, 2. THE BEGINNING, PART II.

Still he was just any old Exo, but Ghosts have an easier time making exact copies of physical hardware (matter) than hacking and understanding individual species coding? Also in the scentence before he said he was damaged in write-protected process so he would have to override those defenses then rewrite the cognition moduals. It‚Äôs all space magic.
                That's basically my reaction to any minor inconvenience in Destiny.  Stubbed my toe?  Heavy brick fell of a cliff?  I'm just killing myself üòÇ
                    I wonder if guardians feel and remember the trauma and fear from each death or if ghost shelters us from the experience.
                        Guardians jumping to their death off the Tower is canon so either we're sheltered from the trauma or so desensitized to it that it's a valid form of entertainment
                            I mean, if you knew you'd be okay afterwards, wouldn't you do shit like that just for funsies? I sure would.
                        In the lore entry about the guardian stuck on the almighty, the ghost says that they usually don‚Äôt have to wait for guardians to actually die before ‚Äúreviving‚Äù them. So probably usually spared the experience.
                        Some Warlocks, *Thanatonauts*, repeatedly commit suicide in an attempt to see the afterlife.
                        you just mentioning the game in the thread.
                        this is why I think being a Guardian would be absolute hell. An excruciating painful death, just to be brought back and expect to go through it again at least three more times before you even finish the mission.
                            This is what the Drifter hates the light. He died a lot in his early days and many of them were violent deaths. So now he wants to do anything to avoid being killed and doesn‚Äôt have the rosy outlook on the Light most Guardians seem to have.
                Wait, felwinter‚Äôs ghost is felspring? Where are felsummer and felfall?
                    Well that‚Äôs what he named his junk, so we don‚Äôt really talk about that
                    That's the name Felwinter gave his ghost, just thinking it was a neat little spin off of his name. 

Also, it would be Felautumn I think. Felfall sounds stupid lol
                    Did someone say felafal?
                >had to get him to kill himself

We literally jump off of the tower for fun. "Getting" us guardians to kill ourselves is not a difficult task lol
                    It wasnt a problem for him to kill himself. It just goes to show that Felwinter had to be dead because so little knowledge was available on Exo's that Felspring couldnt work on him when he was alive.
                        Ah. Yeah i was just trying to make a dumb joke :p
                            I got it :) dont worry
            Ah. The good old science-y reason lol bungie. thank you.
            Maybe we might learn more as we‚Äôll be going to the deep stone crypt this fall
            Probably because the exos are based off Vex tech
        Hopes and dreams?  

 I've never found lore that describes how Exo bodies physically function,  but we know their bodies are 100% machine and that the minds where somehow transferred digitally to the Exo body. 

 As for food Cayde-6 actually has lore describing what eating is like for him.  He doesn't get hungry,  and he doesn't even taste,  dude just eats because he likes the mouth feel of certain foods.

(Past this point is speculation)  Personally I'm not even sure they feel they same as regular people do,  prolly just their circuitry sensing something is touching him and translating to his mind as a feel sensation
            >prolly just their circuitry sensing something is touching him and translating to his mind as a feel sensation

Tbf, that's basically what happens with people but our circuits are juicier
                Please dont describe nerves as juicy circuits
                    Our brains run on binary, because the Juiciest Circuits in our head fire in On/Off sequences
            Wait Cayde couldn't taste? What about the Exo who could taste speeds?
                no no, that's called drugs
            I think at this point " type stuff
        At the core of every exo is a dilithium crystal immersed in flubber with a vibranium casing.
            Oh. ISEE : -.    )
        I‚Äôm not quite sure but it could be in a similar way to the vex, if you go to a certain little vex structure on nessus as an exo character ghost will say something about how it‚Äôs similar to something about exos.
            yup, I inspected the conflux yesterday and it said that it burned out because it came in contact with my exo body, implying a connection between Exos and Vex.
        I imagine they can break down water into hydrogen and oxygen and just use a mini fusion reactor. Safe clean energy that won't explode if something goes wrong.
        it is probably Golden Age biofuel being integrated within Exos. even more Complicated even with Lightbearer Exos.
        I think radiolaria (vex mind goop)
    The mind rejection stuff still happens after a guardian gets brought back from the dead? Does that mean Exo guardians have to go get reset or whatever and advance to the next number too?
        I've never seen any lore supporting that they don't.  I don't think the base physical limits of a person gets changed when they become a guardian,  seems even that they still age.
            Alright cool. That makes sense. I wonder who resets them then and what will happen when our Exo guardians need to be reset.
                One at a time. No wonder!
            Iirc there's unreleased lore about exo warlock I think? going insane from too many deaths/suicides, could be related.
        At that point I think their mind knows that,to quote soldier, ‚Äú were not dieing, we are going to live forever‚Äù
            oh Traveler, Soldier as a Guardian, I can hear the enemies of Man weeping from here
    I wish we had a DLC that would like expand lore more about Exos
        I think a little mystery is healthy for the game.
            Yeah you right
            first game was great cos of the mystery. combine the story of the second game and you‚Äôve got a mastahpiece
        Next fall DLC does have the Deep Stone Crypt, so maybe we will during one of the seasons?
            I hope so, that is one of the most interesting things about destiny. Maybe even about the exo stranger
    Does that mean exist can fuck?
        Yes. Pretty widely known fact that they can, given that it‚Äôs a critical human function. Ikora had an exo boyfriend at one point, imagine what they got up to.
    Except DER was made up so are we sure they need to eat?
    that‚Äôs fucking interesting lol
    Exo schizophrenics..?
    Hence Cayde and his ramen
    [deleted]
        I'm gonna be honest chief.  I'm not sure I understand the meaning behind this comment
They do eat. If you wished for Failsafe to narrate your Last Wish raid as an Exo, she'll comment - "Why do robots need to eat?" plus Cayde spent a LOT of glimmer on ramen {hence his photo is there)(and I suspect it's his Ramen vending machine near Zavala office)
Ever since the great collapse humans have lost their greatest knowledge and technology.

Currently Omolon is the only group making tech anywhere near the shit humanity had at its zenith. 

Exos don't need food, and as far as we know they don't have any other power sources.

It's entirely possible that they're powered by an advanced energy source like a mini reactor, like the Master Chiefs armor in Halo. Spartan Amor has a mini nuclear reactor built in that powers the suit.

Given the advancements of the Golden Age, they might be powered for hundreds or thousands of years by a core. It might pose a problem later on in the future of the lore.

This is all speculation.
    >‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be worn.
    Huh. So if one day they run out of power, do ghosts just keep reviving them and then they keep dying?
        In Drifters lore his ghost said he could revive him without the hunger, but he told the ghost to fuck off. I would assume the same could be done for Exos even if the mechanism for it isn't clear.
Are exos plants?
    Power plants.
        Exos are the powerhouses of the City
Exo lore is super cool, definitely worth reading.
I've seen Cayde-6 eat ramen before.
Technically yes, they do. It's to prevent the mind from rejecting the body.
"I just ate!" - Cayde-6 on Exodus Crash Strike, Nessus
Yeah they're robots
Nahh,  it wasn't just the drifter anyway,  it was the whole squad dying and getting revived and dying again in a loop for years
    Theres a different lore book where the drifter first gets risen by his ghost and he keeps dying because he doesnt trust his ghost, long before the ice rock stuff.

Edit: the lore book is A Man With No Name: Dogma
They can stop you from dying of starvation. But you‚Äôre still hungry.
    That doesn't sound accurate, seeing as how Drifter specifically says "Ghost can cure starvation"
        Starvation as in dying of starvation. Not starvation as in having no food inside you. While Guardians can technically get away with not eating or sleeping, it‚Äôs not a pleasant experience and probably dangerous too. We know from indirect statements that Guardians don‚Äôt have an infinite amount of light. Repeated deaths, healings, super use, etc can leave them and their Ghosts drained. 

We know of one concrete consequence to this: longer and longer resurrection times. But it would make logical sense for this to all transfer to things like slower ‚Äúsuper recharge rate‚Äù slower healing, reduced power, etc. 

So while you could have Guardians deploying without food. They‚Äôd be hungry, irritable, weaker, and more vulnerable. 

As far as I can tell Guardians are effectively identical to normal humans/Exos/Awoken, with the sole exceptions of powers, resurrection, and healing. They still eat, drink, breathe, shit, and fuck. Exo Guardians might no longer suffer from DER, though we can‚Äôt be sure. And if they do they can probably fix it via death/resurrection rather than a reset.

EDIT: Forgot to mention an important part. Sleep is mentioned multiple times in the lore as something Guardians should do but can technically go without. Dredgen Yor had terrible insomnia, Shaxx mentions Thanatology as ‚Äúan excuse for insomnia‚Äù, Exos and Hunters are both noted as having trouble sleeping and that being framed as a bad thing, etc.
            This is the correct answer. Yeah you can just get your Ghost to revive you when you keel over but that ain‚Äôt a life worth living. 

Drifter could only crawl he was so starved. When his Ghost reset him, he had the energy to sit back up but he still felt hungry. Who knows how long it was before he got a decent meal to eat?

Dying over and over only to come back feeling just as bad as before. Never once feeling ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòfull‚Äô. Guardians need to eat so they can maintain themselves and also not feel terrible.
I don't think that's accurate. That wasn't my understanding of the lore anyway.
This is the right answer. His ghost says to him "I can cure your hunger you know?" And the Drifter says no even though he starves many times. I forget what lore card it is but it's in the main Drifter set.
> tention

We‚Äôre about to die off hunger
The Fallen never ate babies, it was the Drifter all along ...
For a while, and only my car
Kinda reminds me of Barbosa and the crew, from the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
And this is why the darkness is our salvation
Oh I gotcha
Yes
The rest of his crew were also hungry. It can heal the damage caused by starvation, but it can‚Äôt magic food into your belly.
    That was on the ice planet, where the Light was muted (so they couldn't be cured of their starvation on top of there being no food).
        They could be cured of death most of the time. There‚Äôs no reason it couldn‚Äôt also cure their starvation if it was normally capable of it. 

Being hungry isn‚Äôt an injury. The Ghost can heal imjury, heal fatigue induced damage, but it can‚Äôt make you feel rested or full. 

Drifter is paranoid, but he‚Äôs not so stupid as to let himself feel starving without a choice. He let himself die from it, possibly because it made him feel slightly less hungry than living with it, but mostly due to the principle of it.
They dont NEED it but it helps
    Just like guardians
        Exactly
    Plants do need nutrients to survive. If you aren't fertilizing, they're still getting nutrients from the soil. Plants that grow in nutrient poor soil have other ways around this. Carnivorous plants, for example, do sort of have to eat.
        The ‚Äúgrenade‚Äù (firework) doesn‚Äôt eat anything
            Is that a plant? What's the genus and species? I'm interested.
            And Warlocks eat grenades.
                I thought that was just Titans, mistaking them for crayons
Plants will do fine without fertilizer in proper soil. If not I‚Äôm good soil fertilizer is needed
That's because in the lore book, Drifter refuses to let his ghost make him not starving.
it was Eli. drifter has had a lot of names
Yes.
I agree
sorry for ruining the chain but uh, **wha**
It was a raid before we arrived, with an invulnerable boss with no way to weaken it.

    Yes. Pretty widely known fact that they can, given that it‚Äôs a critical human function. Ikora had an exo boyfriend at one point, imagine what they got up to.
Except DER was made up so are we sure they need to eat?
that‚Äôs fucking interesting lol
Exo schizophrenics..?
Hence Cayde and his ramen

    I'm gonna be honest chief.  I'm not sure I understand the meaning behind this comment
>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be worn.
Huh. So if one day they run out of power, do ghosts just keep reviving them and then they keep dying?
    In Drifters lore his ghost said he could revive him without the hunger, but he told the ghost to fuck off. I would assume the same could be done for Exos even if the mechanism for it isn't clear.
Power plants.
    Exos are the powerhouses of the City
Theres a different lore book where the drifter first gets risen by his ghost and he keeps dying because he doesnt trust his ghost, long before the ice rock stuff.

Edit: the lore book is A Man With No Name: Dogma
That doesn't sound accurate, seeing as how Drifter specifically says "Ghost can cure starvation"
    Starvation as in dying of starvation. Not starvation as in having no food inside you. While Guardians can technically get away with not eating or sleeping, it‚Äôs not a pleasant experience and probably dangerous too. We know from indirect statements that Guardians don‚Äôt have an infinite amount of light. Repeated deaths, healings, super use, etc can leave them and their Ghosts drained. 

We know of one concrete consequence to this: longer and longer resurrection times. But it would make logical sense for this to all transfer to things like slower ‚Äúsuper recharge rate‚Äù slower healing, reduced power, etc. 

So while you could have Guardians deploying without food. They‚Äôd be hungry, irritable, weaker, and more vulnerable. 

As far as I can tell Guardians are effectively identical to normal humans/Exos/Awoken, with the sole exceptions of powers, resurrection, and healing. They still eat, drink, breathe, shit, and fuck. Exo Guardians might no longer suffer from DER, though we can‚Äôt be sure. And if they do they can probably fix it via death/resurrection rather than a reset.

EDIT: Forgot to mention an important part. Sleep is mentioned multiple times in the lore as something Guardians should do but can technically go without. Dredgen Yor had terrible insomnia, Shaxx mentions Thanatology as ‚Äúan excuse for insomnia‚Äù, Exos and Hunters are both noted as having trouble sleeping and that being framed as a bad thing, etc.
        This is the correct answer. Yeah you can just get your Ghost to revive you when you keel over but that ain‚Äôt a life worth living. 

Drifter could only crawl he was so starved. When his Ghost reset him, he had the energy to sit back up but he still felt hungry. Who knows how long it was before he got a decent meal to eat?

Dying over and over only to come back feeling just as bad as before. Never once feeling ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòfull‚Äô. Guardians need to eat so they can maintain themselves and also not feel terrible.
That was on the ice planet, where the Light was muted (so they couldn't be cured of their starvation on top of there being no food).
    They could be cured of death most of the time. There‚Äôs no reason it couldn‚Äôt also cure their starvation if it was normally capable of it. 

Being hungry isn‚Äôt an injury. The Ghost can heal imjury, heal fatigue induced damage, but it can‚Äôt make you feel rested or full. 

Drifter is paranoid, but he‚Äôs not so stupid as to let himself feel starving without a choice. He let himself die from it, possibly because it made him feel slightly less hungry than living with it, but mostly due to the principle of it.
Just like guardians
    Exactly
Plants do need nutrients to survive. If you aren't fertilizing, they're still getting nutrients from the soil. Plants that grow in nutrient poor soil have other ways around this. Carnivorous plants, for example, do sort of have to eat.
    The ‚Äúgrenade‚Äù (firework) doesn‚Äôt eat anything
        Is that a plant? What's the genus and species? I'm interested.
        And Warlocks eat grenades.
            I thought that was just Titans, mistaking them for crayons
Well didnt it need the guardian Crystal's to become immune?
    No, we needed those to make it become vulnerable.

They were harvesting the crystals to try to empower savathun.
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really known. Apparently, they‚Äôre so mechanically advanced that only Ghosts can comprehend their inner workings.
    Even then, not a great ton, at least at one point. Felwinter was having issues with his Exo body early into his life after being resurrected and his Ghost, Felspring, had to get him to kill himself so she could repair and rebuild instead of what could've been done with more knowledge available, iirc.
        I think that had to do with him being a mini Rasputin, the preparatory hardware and firmware was way too complex for the ghost to mess with, that's why it wanted Felwinter to blow his head out  


at least that's what I got from it, need to re-watch that video
            It was absolutely to do with him being an Exo, cause he isn't a mini Rasputin. He is an exo that was under the influence of Rasputin.
                No he is a seraph which is way advanced beyond an Exo. For one he‚Äôs most likely an AI and not a human brain mapped into a robot, and for two he is specifically built advanced to control warmind systems.

He‚Äôs an Exo like Mara is an awoken. Both are well beyond what the norm
                    Yeah Mara cheated. Being the first awoken and a God among her own people has its privileges.
            Proprietary?
            ‚ÄúThe drone spun uneasily. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a Exo. Existing were made in the Golden Age, with proprietary tech. I can‚Äôt hack into your head to fix the damage, but I can rebuild you as you were. If you shot yourself, I could work quicker‚Äù‚Äù -Lore, Dusk and Dawn, The Liar, 2. THE BEGINNING, PART II.

Still he was just any old Exo, but Ghosts have an easier time making exact copies of physical hardware (matter) than hacking and understanding individual species coding? Also in the scentence before he said he was damaged in write-protected process so he would have to override those defenses then rewrite the cognition moduals. It‚Äôs all space magic.
        That's basically my reaction to any minor inconvenience in Destiny.  Stubbed my toe?  Heavy brick fell of a cliff?  I'm just killing myself üòÇ
            I wonder if guardians feel and remember the trauma and fear from each death or if ghost shelters us from the experience.
                Guardians jumping to their death off the Tower is canon so either we're sheltered from the trauma or so desensitized to it that it's a valid form of entertainment
                    I mean, if you knew you'd be okay afterwards, wouldn't you do shit like that just for funsies? I sure would.
                In the lore entry about the guardian stuck on the almighty, the ghost says that they usually don‚Äôt have to wait for guardians to actually die before ‚Äúreviving‚Äù them. So probably usually spared the experience.
                Some Warlocks, *Thanatonauts*, repeatedly commit suicide in an attempt to see the afterlife.
                you just mentioning the game in the thread.
                this is why I think being a Guardian would be absolute hell. An excruciating painful death, just to be brought back and expect to go through it again at least three more times before you even finish the mission.
                    This is what the Drifter hates the light. He died a lot in his early days and many of them were violent deaths. So now he wants to do anything to avoid being killed and doesn‚Äôt have the rosy outlook on the Light most Guardians seem to have.
        Wait, felwinter‚Äôs ghost is felspring? Where are felsummer and felfall?
            Well that‚Äôs what he named his junk, so we don‚Äôt really talk about that
            That's the name Felwinter gave his ghost, just thinking it was a neat little spin off of his name. 

Also, it would be Felautumn I think. Felfall sounds stupid lol
            Did someone say felafal?
        >had to get him to kill himself

We literally jump off of the tower for fun. "Getting" us guardians to kill ourselves is not a difficult task lol
            It wasnt a problem for him to kill himself. It just goes to show that Felwinter had to be dead because so little knowledge was available on Exo's that Felspring couldnt work on him when he was alive.
                Ah. Yeah i was just trying to make a dumb joke :p
                    I got it :) dont worry
    Ah. The good old science-y reason lol bungie. thank you.
    Maybe we might learn more as we‚Äôll be going to the deep stone crypt this fall
    Probably because the exos are based off Vex tech
Hopes and dreams?  

 I've never found lore that describes how Exo bodies physically function,  but we know their bodies are 100% machine and that the minds where somehow transferred digitally to the Exo body. 

 As for food Cayde-6 actually has lore describing what eating is like for him.  He doesn't get hungry,  and he doesn't even taste,  dude just eats because he likes the mouth feel of certain foods.

(Past this point is speculation)  Personally I'm not even sure they feel they same as regular people do,  prolly just their circuitry sensing something is touching him and translating to his mind as a feel sensation
    >prolly just their circuitry sensing something is touching him and translating to his mind as a feel sensation

Tbf, that's basically what happens with people but our circuits are juicier
        Please dont describe nerves as juicy circuits
            Our brains run on binary, because the Juiciest Circuits in our head fire in On/Off sequences
    Wait Cayde couldn't taste? What about the Exo who could taste speeds?
        no no, that's called drugs
    I think at this point " type stuff
At the core of every exo is a dilithium crystal immersed in flubber with a vibranium casing.
    Oh. ISEE : -.    )
I‚Äôm not quite sure but it could be in a similar way to the vex, if you go to a certain little vex structure on nessus as an exo character ghost will say something about how it‚Äôs similar to something about exos.
    yup, I inspected the conflux yesterday and it said that it burned out because it came in contact with my exo body, implying a connection between Exos and Vex.
I imagine they can break down water into hydrogen and oxygen and just use a mini fusion reactor. Safe clean energy that won't explode if something goes wrong.
it is probably Golden Age biofuel being integrated within Exos. even more Complicated even with Lightbearer Exos.
I think radiolaria (vex mind goop)
I've never seen any lore supporting that they don't.  I don't think the base physical limits of a person gets changed when they become a guardian,  seems even that they still age.
    Alright cool. That makes sense. I wonder who resets them then and what will happen when our Exo guardians need to be reset.
        One at a time. No wonder!
    Iirc there's unreleased lore about exo warlock I think? going insane from too many deaths/suicides, could be related.
At that point I think their mind knows that,to quote soldier, ‚Äú were not dieing, we are going to live forever‚Äù
    oh Traveler, Soldier as a Guardian, I can hear the enemies of Man weeping from here
I think a little mystery is healthy for the game.
    Yeah you right
    first game was great cos of the mystery. combine the story of the second game and you‚Äôve got a mastahpiece
Next fall DLC does have the Deep Stone Crypt, so maybe we will during one of the seasons?
    I hope so, that is one of the most interesting things about destiny. Maybe even about the exo stranger
