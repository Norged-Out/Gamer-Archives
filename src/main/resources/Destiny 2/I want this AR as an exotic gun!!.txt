[[I want this AR as an exotic gun!!]]





I really want an exotic kinetic that has a beefed up version of kinetic tremors.

Make it an AR with a 100 round magazine so you don‚Äôt have to reload as much and just spray. Would also be fun to pair with actium war rig.
    360, 450, 600 or 720RPM which one would you prefer most??
        Well kinetic tremors is based on shots fired so faster rate of fire makes sense. 100 rounds and 720 would be crazy but it‚Äôd be more fun if it had max range and stability. So like a laser beam that makes shockwaves.

To make the kinetic tremors more ‚Äúexotic‚Äù make the shockwaves have elemental damage based on your subclass  and every 4th shockwave do some kind of subclass verb like weaken for void, blind for arc.
            Make the effect change depending on your subclass

- Void: Shockwaves apply volatile and if it hits an enemy already volatile it triggers the explosion.

- Solar: Shockwaves apply burning and enemies killed by the shockwave ignite

- Arc: Shockwaves apply volt shot.

- Stasis: Shockwaves apply slowness and can freeze. The shockwaves shatters crystals and frozen enemies.

- Strand: Shockwaves suspend enemies.
                What Tesselation should have been
                    It still has a chance with the catalyst.
                        guarantee that catalyst revolves around eating the transcendence grenade and nothing else
                            it better turn into a goddamn nuke if it does that
                                Best I can do is the damage of 1.5 rockets.
                                    1.5 base rocket dmg
                Suspend will be broken. Probably sever at most.
                    For me sever is basically useless
                Void would be insane with controlled demolition on titan
            Just make it a trace at this point üòÇ
                But actium war rig‚Ä¶

But fine. A kinetic trace with kinetic tremors would be really cool.
                    Orrrrr make it so you can switch firing types from trace to AR
                        How would that work with ammo. A primary ammo, kinetic, trace rifle? That almost sounds too exotic.
                            Make the trace rifle do less damage and less tremors if primary and the auto rifle do more damage if special

Or make it heavy
                            Make it a literal water hose
                                Auto slug machine that shoots heavy arching bullets that requires you to adjust for.  Every 10th slug causes kinetic tremors with a fire rate of 360.
                                    That sounds really cool
            I don't know, I say make it a 450 with the stats of a high impact frame, a higher damage profile, and it's a bit more controllable. Though that's just my train of thought, it's always fun to speculate possible ideas.
        360.
            I love 450 RPM  AR. Shadow Price is my favourite to this day.
        360 but every time its kinetic tremors perk triggers (maybe named Earthquake or something) or you get a kill it shoots faster. (360/450/600/720/900 RPM) The perk would last 6 seconds

It behaves like a 360 RPM with its range and damage but has the recoil of a 600 RPM.

The catalyst would give the weapon Rewind Rounds and +15 bullets in the mag

It would have a 100~ bullets mag.
        Starts 360, and dealing damage/triggering a tremor, ups it's rate of fire.
        1200, I want to see the world burn, and players to freak tf out lol
    Put kinetic tremors on sweet business
        I think that is a great idea to be honest. I love the way sweet business is already but adding KT would be amazing.
    Sweet Business 2 Electric Boogaloo
    if only we had an exotic AR with a high mag and firerate with occasional explosive rounds already lol
        Not really the same.
    Just put Kinetic Tremors on Sweet Business and you've got what you want.
    Honestly Bastion having a beefy kinetic tremors would be awesome
    Sweet Business is probably as close as you‚Äôll get
        I mean yeah sweet business exist but I want an exotic with kinetic tremors. If they add kinetic tremors to sweet business it would be cool.
            I mean they added explosive payload which is the next best thing
    Tommy‚Äôs Matchbook gives you ignitions! That close enough?
        No!
they should just give us enemy weapons more often like lord of wolves
    We got a knight boomer last season and a scorn crossbow this season
        Care to drop the name of those? Must've missed them.
            Knight boomer is Ex Diris from last season‚Äôs pass and Buried Bloodline is the crossbow from the Warlord‚Äôs Ruin dungeon.
                Thanks!
            Scorn bow is the exotic drop from the Warlords dungeon
        Imagine if it was an actual Scorn Crossbow (as in, the weapons used by the Scorn literally named "Scorn Crossbows").¬† Show them what it's like to get damage glitched by them every once in a while.
            There is an Arbalest Ornament that is as close as we will ever get to the actual scorn crossbow sniper
                Probably, yeah.
    I've been wanting an Arc Spear and Shock Blade for awhile, myself.
        Maybe the Shock Blades can be two swords (in one slot) that trade damage for rate-of-swing with a catalyst that jolts targets with every other hit.
            Make it a Lightweight Frame, too, and its Catalyst allows it to make you Amplified, which gives a faster RoS and a special "Speed Demon Sprint" Light and/or Heavy Attack.
                YES.
    Fun fact:
D1 had entire set of legendary weapons that were modeled after Fallen gear.
        I miss them dearly
    We just got 2 of them within the last 2 seasons. We need Dreg‚Äôs Penis back
Side note, what boots are those?
    https://preview.redd.it/4wp90s6ew1xc1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6fee111067e750b21b6c6378087aac6731df420
        thanks. what season is it from?
            I think they are Dawning boots, from one of the earlier sets I‚Äôd imagine
            It's from Season 9. You can buy it when the dawning event is active.
                fuck. thanks!
    Season of the risen armor probably? (Tusked allegiance boots)
It's the same vandall AR, but its white because it came from house salvation 

And yeah, i also want more elliksni weapons for us.
I still miss dreg's promisse
    Dreg‚Äôs Promise was honestly underrated; I don‚Äôt get why so many people were dunking on that gun back in D1.
        Because they botched its release.

In Y1, where it was released, there were only two pistols in the entire game. This and Vestian Dynasty.
Both were equally dogshit. Sidearms in general were viewed as a wasted slot due to how prominent actual special weapons were with which sidearms shared ammo and slot with in D1.

It didn‚Äôt even have tracking rounds on its initial release and when those got added in Y2 they barely worked only being fixed at the tail end of Y3
I‚Äôd even take back [DoesNotBow](https://www.destinypedia.com/Does_Not_Bow) from destiny 1
    God the PoE/ Reef weapons were so good.
    while we're on it, please give me back my [Devil's dawn](https://www.destinypedia.com/Devil%27s_Dawn)
I've wanted this gun as an exotic for years.
    Same
Since its house salvation it could even be a stasis weapon, it would work really well with the white trim and pale blue glow.
    When I saw this AR, the first word that came into my mind was Sexy.

Before I saw this AR my favourite AR was 'Shadow Price'.
    It's Arc. The fallen arsenal name for it is shock rifle. It's more like a pulse rifle. Like how lord of wolves is shrapnel launcher.
    Nah I‚Äôd prefer a depiction of an enemy weapon that is closer to what the weapon actually functions like (though some level of creative liberties can be applied).
        That‚Äôs fair, I‚Äôd only say this one could be stasis because of context, otherwise I would want an arc pulse rifle, maybe have its shots track like indebted kindness with beacon rounds
Lord of wolves
    This is a shock rifle if I'm not mistaken, not the shrapnel launcher that LoW is. It's still similar tho
        The three fallen weapons are Queenbreakers (D1 and D2), Lord of Wolves (D1 and D2), and dregs promise (D1)

Lord of wolves is the closest there is to that specific gun
            My man. This is not LoW. This is a pulse rifle (it is litteraly called that when you get killed by it). Arc homing projectiles (like dregs promise in D1 or fallen shock pistol)
                There's already a gun that basically does exactly that, and it's called Symmetry
                    not exactly
                    Symmetry is a scout, of which doesn't use or do the same thing that fallen pulse rifles do, they shoot three shots all of which track (with insane accuracy) but do not have the explosive pulse that symmetry does.

Symmetry fires single shots that track and sorta explode in an arc pulse grenade type deal - with revolution being a bigger variant of that.

We're wanting a literal fallen auto rifle, pulse rifle or all in all just a primary weapon period.

We would love dregs promise and I absolutely hope they bring it into the game but honestly? A real fallen pulse or auto looking like that would be absolutely sick!
                        I mean yea, but I don't see how they could really make it any different from the stuff we have in game. Sure, it's a pulse and symmetry is a scout, but the overlap is still there. The gun would be cool, but just having tracking projectiles isn't enough, it needs more
                            Thats the point of an exotic though, it seems like "oh a copy cat" 

Like how tommys was supposed to be for touch of malice if you think about it for a bit, both increase damage but take health ToM just does it better cause its infinite ammo.

Just because they track doesnt mean they cant make a good perk to go with it, like each hit increases fire rate, or hold X to turn the weapon into a laser beam - it doesn't have to always be copies of each other cause one way or another the original or new will always power creep the other.
                            Are you incapable of seeing how much of a redditor-esque asswipe you're being right now?

"Um actually" guy would be an understatement, and you're spreading misinformation to boot. 

Is this bait? Are you baiting people?
                                Lol
                                    It's totally bait. 

You have a kink for being made fun of huh
                    Great then give us an ornament for symmetry that looks like this
                        That'd be rad
Best i can do is a queensbreaker ornament
I just want an exotic khvostov like we had in d1
    We are in the final shape
Looks like Lord of Wolves
    It's a shock rifle.
Omg this would be so fun to use: just locking on your targets by aiming your weapon and watching the bolts fly would be so satisfying (and effective).
If we‚Äôre just talking wish lists: Kinetic Glaive
    Kinetic rocket launcher anyone?
That looks like the Sliquifier from CoD Zombies lol
Anybody else gonna bring up Lord of Wolves?
We‚Äôve all been saying the same thing ever since lord of wolves came out.
Looks like a Fallen flame-thrower to me!
Nah, I want the exotic Kvostov back
    Word on the street it is indeed returning.
        https://preview.redd.it/qi0mekibh2xc1.jpeg?width=606&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04aab6796ecdd585518fd0de8b1d7f6396cb91d3

Oh hoho. Now, this is epic. üòè
    ![gif](giphy|3o7aCRloybJlXpNjSU|downsized)
    We are in the final shape
They‚Äôll find a way to fuck it up

I‚Äôm still mad that the Fallen flak shotgun used by Captains was turned into a shitty ‚Äúshotgun‚Äù that feels more like a pulse rifle
would‚Äôve made a great raid exotic.
    No make it accessible to casual PvE players too; if you really want it to be a challenge to acquire, make it an exotic mission like Vexcalibur was.
        Raid exotics are available to casuals now that there is fireteam finder.
            You still need a mic (or Discord) and the will to spend hours on end attempting to get the raid exotic (that you may not even get, as many raid exotics aren‚Äôt a guarantee).
360, 450, 600 or 720RPM which one would you prefer most??

                guarantee that catalyst revolves around eating the transcendence grenade and nothing else
                    it better turn into a goddamn nuke if it does that
                        Best I can do is the damage of 1.5 rockets.
                            1.5 base rocket dmg
        Suspend will be broken. Probably sever at most.
            For me sever is basically useless
        Void would be insane with controlled demolition on titan
    Just make it a trace at this point üòÇ
        But actium war rig‚Ä¶

But fine. A kinetic trace with kinetic tremors would be really cool.
            Orrrrr make it so you can switch firing types from trace to AR
                How would that work with ammo. A primary ammo, kinetic, trace rifle? That almost sounds too exotic.
                    Make the trace rifle do less damage and less tremors if primary and the auto rifle do more damage if special

Or make it heavy
                    Make it a literal water hose
                        Auto slug machine that shoots heavy arching bullets that requires you to adjust for.  Every 10th slug causes kinetic tremors with a fire rate of 360.
                            That sounds really cool
    I don't know, I say make it a 450 with the stats of a high impact frame, a higher damage profile, and it's a bit more controllable. Though that's just my train of thought, it's always fun to speculate possible ideas.
360.
    I love 450 RPM  AR. Shadow Price is my favourite to this day.
360 but every time its kinetic tremors perk triggers (maybe named Earthquake or something) or you get a kill it shoots faster. (360/450/600/720/900 RPM) The perk would last 6 seconds

It behaves like a 360 RPM with its range and damage but has the recoil of a 600 RPM.

The catalyst would give the weapon Rewind Rounds and +15 bullets in the mag

It would have a 100~ bullets mag.
Starts 360, and dealing damage/triggering a tremor, ups it's rate of fire.
1200, I want to see the world burn, and players to freak tf out lol
I think that is a great idea to be honest. I love the way sweet business is already but adding KT would be amazing.
Not really the same.
I mean yeah sweet business exist but I want an exotic with kinetic tremors. If they add kinetic tremors to sweet business it would be cool.
    I mean they added explosive payload which is the next best thing
No!
Care to drop the name of those? Must've missed them.
    Knight boomer is Ex Diris from last season‚Äôs pass and Buried Bloodline is the crossbow from the Warlord‚Äôs Ruin dungeon.
        Thanks!
    Scorn bow is the exotic drop from the Warlords dungeon
Imagine if it was an actual Scorn Crossbow (as in, the weapons used by the Scorn literally named "Scorn Crossbows").¬† Show them what it's like to get damage glitched by them every once in a while.
    There is an Arbalest Ornament that is as close as we will ever get to the actual scorn crossbow sniper
        Probably, yeah.
Maybe the Shock Blades can be two swords (in one slot) that trade damage for rate-of-swing with a catalyst that jolts targets with every other hit.
    Make it a Lightweight Frame, too, and its Catalyst allows it to make you Amplified, which gives a faster RoS and a special "Speed Demon Sprint" Light and/or Heavy Attack.
        YES.
I miss them dearly
thanks. what season is it from?
    I think they are Dawning boots, from one of the earlier sets I‚Äôd imagine
    It's from Season 9. You can buy it when the dawning event is active.
        fuck. thanks!
Because they botched its release.

In Y1, where it was released, there were only two pistols in the entire game. This and Vestian Dynasty.
Both were equally dogshit. Sidearms in general were viewed as a wasted slot due to how prominent actual special weapons were with which sidearms shared ammo and slot with in D1.

It didn‚Äôt even have tracking rounds on its initial release and when those got added in Y2 they barely worked only being fixed at the tail end of Y3
That‚Äôs fair, I‚Äôd only say this one could be stasis because of context, otherwise I would want an arc pulse rifle, maybe have its shots track like indebted kindness with beacon rounds
The three fallen weapons are Queenbreakers (D1 and D2), Lord of Wolves (D1 and D2), and dregs promise (D1)

Lord of wolves is the closest there is to that specific gun
    My man. This is not LoW. This is a pulse rifle (it is litteraly called that when you get killed by it). Arc homing projectiles (like dregs promise in D1 or fallen shock pistol)
        There's already a gun that basically does exactly that, and it's called Symmetry
            not exactly
            Symmetry is a scout, of which doesn't use or do the same thing that fallen pulse rifles do, they shoot three shots all of which track (with insane accuracy) but do not have the explosive pulse that symmetry does.

Symmetry fires single shots that track and sorta explode in an arc pulse grenade type deal - with revolution being a bigger variant of that.

We're wanting a literal fallen auto rifle, pulse rifle or all in all just a primary weapon period.

We would love dregs promise and I absolutely hope they bring it into the game but honestly? A real fallen pulse or auto looking like that would be absolutely sick!
                I mean yea, but I don't see how they could really make it any different from the stuff we have in game. Sure, it's a pulse and symmetry is a scout, but the overlap is still there. The gun would be cool, but just having tracking projectiles isn't enough, it needs more
                    Thats the point of an exotic though, it seems like "oh a copy cat" 

Like how tommys was supposed to be for touch of malice if you think about it for a bit, both increase damage but take health ToM just does it better cause its infinite ammo.

Just because they track doesnt mean they cant make a good perk to go with it, like each hit increases fire rate, or hold X to turn the weapon into a laser beam - it doesn't have to always be copies of each other cause one way or another the original or new will always power creep the other.
                    Are you incapable of seeing how much of a redditor-esque asswipe you're being right now?

"Um actually" guy would be an understatement, and you're spreading misinformation to boot. 

Is this bait? Are you baiting people?
                        Lol
                            It's totally bait. 

You have a kink for being made fun of huh
            Great then give us an ornament for symmetry that looks like this
                That'd be rad

Oh hoho. Now, this is epic. üòè
Raid exotics are available to casuals now that there is fireteam finder.
    You still need a mic (or Discord) and the will to spend hours on end attempting to get the raid exotic (that you may not even get, as many raid exotics aren‚Äôt a guarantee).
Make the effect change depending on your subclass

- Void: Shockwaves apply volatile and if it hits an enemy already volatile it triggers the explosion.

- Solar: Shockwaves apply burning and enemies killed by the shockwave ignite

- Arc: Shockwaves apply volt shot.

- Stasis: Shockwaves apply slowness and can freeze. The shockwaves shatters crystals and frozen enemies.

- Strand: Shockwaves suspend enemies.
    What Tesselation should have been
        It still has a chance with the catalyst.
            guarantee that catalyst revolves around eating the transcendence grenade and nothing else
                it better turn into a goddamn nuke if it does that
                    Best I can do is the damage of 1.5 rockets.
                        1.5 base rocket dmg
    Suspend will be broken. Probably sever at most.
        For me sever is basically useless
    Void would be insane with controlled demolition on titan
Just make it a trace at this point üòÇ
    But actium war rig‚Ä¶

But fine. A kinetic trace with kinetic tremors would be really cool.
        Orrrrr make it so you can switch firing types from trace to AR
            How would that work with ammo. A primary ammo, kinetic, trace rifle? That almost sounds too exotic.
                Make the trace rifle do less damage and less tremors if primary and the auto rifle do more damage if special

Or make it heavy
                Make it a literal water hose
                    Auto slug machine that shoots heavy arching bullets that requires you to adjust for.  Every 10th slug causes kinetic tremors with a fire rate of 360.
                        That sounds really cool
I don't know, I say make it a 450 with the stats of a high impact frame, a higher damage profile, and it's a bit more controllable. Though that's just my train of thought, it's always fun to speculate possible ideas.
I love 450 RPM  AR. Shadow Price is my favourite to this day.
