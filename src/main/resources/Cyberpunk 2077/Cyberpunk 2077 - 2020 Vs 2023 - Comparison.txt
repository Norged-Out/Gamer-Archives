[[Cyberpunk 2077 - 2020 Vs 2023 - Comparison]]

One thing I wish they fixed is if you have short hair or no hair and put a hat on, all of a sudden you have more hair
    One more gripe is that you cannot see your gloves in first person.
        I think it's probably because that little wire you always use is in your wrist, so they hide the gloves in the actual gameplay view. Your jacket sleeves also get rolled up in first person too, also for the sake of cyberware I imagine. Mantis Blades don't really make sense if they've gotta go through your jacket sleeve lol
            Wouldn't it be crazy if they made the gloves have a little hole for the little wire
                Would raise the poly count on the models, probably tank performance!
                    I mean, it'd just be a texture remodel. From what I understand you wouldn't need to change the gloves model, just add a transparent texture where the hole is. Heck, depending on how small of a hole we're talking it wouldn't need transparency.
                    Wouldnt be much of an issue considering how various clothes have different poly counts anyways. Plus, it wouldnt be very many polys anyways.
                    I legit cannot tell if thats sarcasm or not.
                        Yes it was supposed to be..!
                            Oooh damn sorry then lmao.

And yeah, a sleek and good one... ppl do be saying stupid shit like that with straight face, seen it multiple times on this sub alone.
                gloves with holes?? nonsense. makes more sense to wear gloves which dissapear in First person view
                My characters are still bald when they drive a vehicle.
        I wish that arm mods didn't get rid of your nail art.
    My Cosmetic Gripe is that my tiny 🫣🫣 *enbiggen* when you put tops on because the clothes don't deform to the body.

Which is probably related to the reason we have one body model, and the clothes don't matter for the masc body, but you have 3 chest sizes and they all look the same in the clothes.
        All night city clothing has a LOT of padding in them, due to all the 80s future punk influences.
            [removed]
                More like 28C
            I had to headcannon that it was armored because muh immersion. But now the gear doesn't have armor ;_; my poor flapjacks.

All bodies are <fine3 but they can be smaller sometimes, particularly outside of the nubile/bait anime waifus. Grown adults also come in many sizes, and the mid-size V's are just on the larger side [*relative to her frame*]. And they are further enhanced by the way clothing bulks up.

Though the larger V's also have my condolences because they get a pretty bad compression effect on the other side of the scale :p
            This guy lores
        The existence of clothing with some sort of advanced built-in fake boob technology seems perfectly reasonable in the CP2077 world.  Unfortunately only the elites can afford the clothing that allows for customization, while us plebeians are stuck with one [cup] size fits all.
        That's irritating.
            It is. It's such a small immersion breaker. I understand if they didn't have to time or budget to make deformables, or make 3 models of every top... but then just remove the bust size option.
                They couldn't let guys have dick size without letting the ladies make their boobs bigger, and dick size adjustability was a core design pillar of the game, immutable.
                    Jokes aside I was really kind of expecting, not for the sake of obscenity, that if they had cut/uncut, that they would have the bravery to add innies/outies [to put it politely]. I know the snippy isn't a "natural" occurrence, while the other is, but I am all about some body positivity and they shoulda given the femme body the same attention [clothing/modeling].
        agree if you have a huge bust size, your melons suddenly shrink....thank good modders will fix that again, after the liberty dlc came out so they dont have to do patch work twice
    Also if you have curly hair it magically becomes straight.
    Also it changes your hair color. No hat my V has blonde hair with pale orange tips. Put a hat on and all of their hair turns BRIGHT orange. Super annoying.
    At least it doesn't change your hair type or make you bald like other games.
    Inconsistent quantities of hair? 

Literally unplayable.
    That seems to be fixed on mine. I put on the baseball cap and my character still has short hair.
        I think it's one of those things where no matter what hair style you have it will look this one way when wearing a hat. So I think there are a handful of hairstyles where it will look normal, and many ways where it won't.

The easiest way to tell would be to switch your hair to bald and try it out.
I laughed my ass off the first time i flew out of my car and ate pavement post 2.0
    GTA 4 was ahead of its time
        The fact that you could get thrown out of the car through the windshield was dope.  I rememeber GTA5 having so much worse physics, it was a huge step backwards, but the more busy looking world sort of hid the lack of complex physics.
            To be fair, the cars in IV were too wobbly, V they were too sturdy but it wasn't as bad as IV's wobbliness.
                I don't think they were too wobbly
        Still the best crime sandbox game to date. Super underrated
            You think GTA IV is underrated?
                He spelled sleeping dog wrong clearly
    Man that's still pissing me off lol. I'd like to be able to miss my turn on a bike into a pylon without it becoming a near death experience lmao.
        have you seen what happens to reckless bikers irl?

I honestly wish I never did.
            i wish they would make it so if you die in cyberpunk you die in real life
                okay 👍
            r/meatcrayon
                Why in God's name did I click this link...
        There is a perk called Stuntjock that lets you either jump out or slide out of your vehicle.  I haven't tried it on a bike, though, but I'm sure it works
            I'll have to get it; old habits die hard and I fear I'll never learn to respect the vehicles after years of a certain play style lol. I started fresh since I didn't really want to sit and reallocate so many skill points. Just made sense to take the time to learn them over levelling rather than in one go, for me at least.
        Well, that would kill you irl, so a near death experience is getting off easy.
Yo at least credit the gameplay footage: **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar3LeXoVE1A&ab\_channel=Gameinvader**
    thank you for link to original source 🫂
    thanks, this is what i came for. 

i didn't want to watch a horribly compressed reddit upload of a youtube video. link the youtube video, holy shit people want internet points so bad.
        People get internet points either way though lol, just stupidity
    And look at this they didn’t even acknowledge your comment to even say oh shit sorry thanks
A good comprehensive comparison. While update 2.0 is filled with phenomenal changes and improvements, it's not perfect. I would expect *some* of these issues to be addressed but I'm not sure how much more time and effort CDPR wants to put toward this game after Phantom Liberty. 

We should expect patches to address larger glaring issues, for sure, but I can't see them changing the NPC behavior for when you block a sidewalk. 

^(The underwater shadow is something else, though. That's crazy looking.)
    If they released [real modding tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO44e1rs9Ls&t=1s), modders could improve the game.
        The Bethesda approach.
            At least Bethesda doesn't leave console owners hanging. CDPR is very PC-centric so modding for their games only cover (less than) half the fanbase.
                Over half of CP2077 sales were on PC. It was 56% PC, 28% Playstation, and 17% Xbox. Obviously the numbers may have changed since then, but yeah.
            At least Bethesda actually made Starfield feel like a fucking game compared to this broken piece of shit at launch.
                Well, Cyberpunk certainly has its own feel these days. It always had, and now very much so, had its own vibe. Now it's just 10x better.
                Cope, Starfield is the same shit as Cyberpunk but its a Bethesda game.
                    I take it you played Starfield then? And Cyberpunk at launch? 

Cyberpunk crashed multiple times for me in a 2 hour span, had multiple physics bugs and the very first chase mission broke for me to the point where I had to restart the game for it to work. The game was a clusterfuck, had multiple mechanics that were half assed and overhyped. And I don’t just mean the way the game played, I mean what they actually implemented was executed in a broken state. Combat, police spawning, vehicle mechanics. 

You can criticize Starfield for it’s mechanics. That’s all personal preference. But you seriously can not sit here and say the game was broken on launch. Or that it isn’t at least cohesive. I played the early access and had a couple physics bugs in my 15 hours of playing, but nothing game breaking. Mainly just funny stuff like asteroids or random ships spinning. It was nowhere NEAR the level of mess as Cyberpunk or even Skyrim at launch. You people just find reasons to shit on Bethesda because it’s Bethesda.
            [deleted]
                I played Skyrim at launch on the 360 and hard agree. While the main quest went mostly smoothly, the rest of the sidequests were bugged to hell. I remember following [this guide](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Glitches) because some quest rewards were straight up unobtainable because of quest-related bugs.
                I remember coming back to Skyrim years after release and they never fixed things like getting shouted through walls and stuck there, and a damned main quest breaking bug that blocked all progress and you had to start again. And then they just left it. It was appalling, and presumably those bugs are STILL there!!
                    [deleted]
                        Set aside all of the bad glitches and poor launch, Skyrim is highly anticipated because of its legacy.

The Elder Scrolls Franchise is one of the longest and  pretty well known franchise within the gaming world.


Skyrim really captivated all of its audience because of the seemingly vast world and the immersion of the game also makes it such a memorable game to many others.

I, for one, invested 2 days of just playing Skyrim because the world is interesting and unique. The NPCs have their own routine and not just static A.I who only acts when the player is nearby.

They react to your actions and will confront you.


I mean I can put a bucket on to a trader and steal all of his shit without getting caught. For a 2011 game, that was groundbreaking. Can't do that shit in CP77.

Skyrim is also one of the quotable games as you can say anything an NPC said other gamers would most likely recognise it.
                I got skyrim on release. Got about 70hrs in and somehow over the course of 2, possibly 3 updates, something caused my save file(s) to totally bork. Like just randomly while playing a bunch of textures wouldn't load properly and objects in the environment would just be a flat purple placeholder one and would eventually CTD. 



Then even if you didn't have that going on, it would 100% CTD when trying to enter very specific interior cells. Even if you COC'd in the console there it would crash. One of those was an area required to progress the main story, and even if you tried to just do other random stuff it was getting more and frequent. I was staggering saves but by the time I fully realized how bad of a problem it was I would have had to go way to far back just to test if that would fix it. I had to restart entirely and then didn't have any issues like that since. I remember looking it up back than and wasn't the only one with those same 2 issues.


Nothing like the broken save think, but FO3 and NV, Oblivion, and Morrowind were all "crash at least once every hour or two" experiences even years after release without outside mods. 


CP2077 I played 2 back to back playthroughs of about 100hrs each and I think it CTDed maybe 3 times. Other than quirky glitchy NPC  animations and the like I had no other issues.
                    God I wish I had your luck. I ended up crafting and disassembling so much that I hit that weird glitch that completely and irreversibly bricked your save (was patched later, but the save is irreversibly bricked)
                "I was there Gandalf. I was there 3,000 years ago.  I was there the day the strength of Men failed."
                Skyrim on 1st gen ps3's, there was a point where you couldn't go under water without your game crashing instantly. I couldn't play because my most recent saves were me in a cave where the only exit was to swim.  I specifically had to write an email to Bethesda detailing the problem, because they wouldn't patch it.  Cool thing was someone on their team responded to me and their patch a week or two later fixed it.
                Lmao no. 

I played Skyrim on the 360 launch day, and I got to beat the story.

Cyberpunk is not even playable period on PS4 and Xbox One

Stop wearing them rose tinted glasses
                I had the game launch day on 360 and I have zero clue what you're talking about dude.  The only game breaking bug at launch was a PS3 file size issue that caused the save to keep growing until it broke the game.  It was only on the PS3 and was officially patched shortly after.  There were zero mods for us console players back then and it worked fine.  

Taking into account the last Gen versions of 2077, this launch was so much worse.  Anyone that thinks otherwise either didn't play either game at launch, are cherry picking versions they're referring back to, or are completely delusional (yes I know this is the cyberpunk sub so that's a distinct possibility).

As to the updates, you have to remember they *couldn't*, or at least chose not to, patch the game so significantly it broke games on past consoles.  Cyberpunk went the other route (Xbox one and PS4 did not get the 2.0 update because it changed the recommended specs of the game).  There was also the issue of internet bandwidth back then.  Patches weren't nearly as massive as they are now, yet still took forever to download.

Edit - lmao dude gave the most snarky fanboy response and blocked me so I couldn't even reply.  😂  In response to his dumb ass reply though, I also had no issues on Xbox series X aside from blatant missing features meant to be added, but I can objectively view this game as a failed launch overall...
                I don’t know about that. While I was only a teenager when Skyrim came out, I remember it being a really fun experience at launch. I couldn’t even enjoy Cyberpunk at launch, it was seriously rough.
                    Skyrim was much more broken than Cyberpunk. PS3 version literally stopped working when your save file got to a certain size. Was literally a myriad of game breaking bugs. Bricked consoles, bricked entire save datas.

It's hilarious anyone thinks cyberpunk was that broken at all, it's not even in my top 10 top game broken releases. Could and should have been better but it ran and didn't brick things, and you could get lucky and have a full play through with no bugs.

Gamers opinions are much stricter on what's acceptable now, but they also forget quickly

It's funny how you Google something like broken game launches and nowhere mentions the fact Battlefield 4 literally wasn't playable for 6 months. That's how you do a broken release, and that wasn't even that long ago!

Sim city, spore, mcc, assassins creed unity, Arkham Knight. Battlefront 2, wwe 2k20. Some truly shitty releases.
                        Agreed. imo, the Cyberpunk bugs were never the main issue with this game. Most of its huge problems came from how misleading the marketing was and the insane amount of hype. They sold us on some mythical dream game.  


Compared to good ol' Arkham Knight that literally was unplayable for me on release, Ac Unity with the part of the map my character couldn't walk through... or hell even the recent Jedi Survivor with the choppiest stuttery mess of a game ever.
                            Yeah, I can only presume people think cyberpunk was more broken simply because more players played it. For an older head like me I can't get my head around it, it was never that broken
                        So the PS3 version was broke, not Skyrim in general.

On PC it was fine at launch.

Much like CP2077, ironically. The console versions had the most issues.

The worst issues with CP2077 at launch were fundamental design and resources.
                A decade and a couple of remasters later, I still didn't get past a game breaking bug. If I recall correctly, the game constantly crashed when trying to take a boat to a location. (Whiterun?)

The only bug I remember from the launch version of CP2077 is still in the 2.0 version. It's Jackie walking straight though a locker in the Sandra Dorsett mission.
                I have played skyrim 1.0 extensively it wasn't that bad
                I’ve played hundreds of hours of Skyrim on pc without ever touching a mod, you’re totally full of shit if you claim that even a majority of people couldn’t beat the game because it was broken
                    There were so many bugs like being launched into space and the dragons flying backwards and Pastinak or whatever never landing
                    He's not saying it's broken right now but speaking on the initial state. Of course you can beat the game now since the game is 10 years old.
                        I bought it launch day on Xbox 360, I remember no issues that were game breaking.  Game crashing occasionally, yes, which were patched out fairly quickly.

The "game breaking bugs" the person was referring to only existed on PS3.  In that respect, 2077 was way worse including the last Gen versions.
                            I recall a bug on PC that crashed the game every single time it autosaved. It was bad
                            I played on ps3 and never had bugs that stopped my progress or bricked my save.
                            https://venturebeat.com/games/technically-disastrous-skyrim-is-bethesdas-most-solid-release-yet/

You realize a bunch of people played 2077 on pc with no issues right, just like people did on Skyrim. PS3 users were the worst effected but they were there for each console 

Just because you were one of the people that didn't have issues doesn't mean that was the reality for everyone. Having a whole current gen console not being able to play a game is pretty bad 

https://www.neogaf.com/threads/skyrim-vs-cyberpunk-2077-which-game-was-more-buggy-at-release-vote-inside.1581929/

Skyrim is notoriously at the top of worst releases ever, I attached another link comparing 2077 to Skyrim and people voted Skyrim being worse and this was in 2020 at the peak of the glitches in cyberpunk 


https://www.cbr.com/worst-unfinished-game-glitches-bugs/

https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/10-games-that-were-broken-at-launch.htm#pt1


I'll acknowledge that there's a chance that your single experience could be more telling then the masses who experienced both launches. There's a chance they're all misremembering it since it was 10 years ago
                                So every link you posted, in both article and comments specifically mention the PS3 bug I mentioned.  That was that.  Was there a long list of bugs in general?  Yeah, have you seen the length of patches of Baldur's Gate 3?  Patch 1 fixed over 1000 bugs and is probably going to be GOTY.

Cyberpunk had baaaad bugs on multiple systems, and obviously removed intended features at release, across the board, which we're now getting a glimpse of.  It's generally regarded as one of the worst launches ever for a game.

I could keep pulling links but I've got dinner to tend to.
                                    Both are regarded as terrible launches, I acknowledged that ps3 was the main culprit so you'd actually engage with what I said but you don't seem to want to do that 

One of the links I mentioned had people talking about issues on Xbox and pc, just because ps3 was the worst doesn't mean there weren't major issues elsewhere. I'm not sure I see your point
                    [deleted]
                Skyrim UI is still unplayable, even WITH SkyUI.
                Skyrim bricked my PS3, so yeah.

Edit: PS3 got autocorrected to PS4. Hate that shit.
                Uh, I definitely beat the main quest multiple times without any mods. I didn't play it all the way back at launch though
                    [deleted]
                        Hell, I couldn't make it to the chopping block in the intro due to the physics engine bugging out at more than 60fps. The carriages just flipped into the sky
                            Fallout 4 had an issue at launch on PC where if you were playing at above 100 FPS you could lock the game trying to exit a terminal. I had to replay so much of the game each time it hardlocked and had to start quick-saving before accessing any terminal in case it happened until I found the issue.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3s4y20/psa\_getting\_stuck\_at\_terminals\_here\_is\_a\_fix/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3s4y20/psa_getting_stuck_at_terminals_here_is_a_fix/) 

It had a workaround, but it was pretty dumb issue to have. My monitor has a button to change refresh rate and so I enabled vsync and when entering a terminal I'd set it to 60hz, then readjust it back to 144hz when I'd left the terminal.
                        Yep same for me on pc, literally couldn't progress
                        I never had that bug but you were on PC, you could have also just phased through the door with TCL.
                >the main quest was literally unbeatable because it was so bugged.

So, you think people on consoles just... couldn't play the game at launch? And people just ignored that?

C'mon, lol

Makes me feel old that it's been so long since Skyrim launched that people will just say whatever about it.
                Yeah, Cyberpunk was *bad* but I lost 2 entire saves to bugs in skyrim.
        I really wish they would do this, if they are done with the game at least let the public do what they want with it and make it the game it always should have been,
            They're also done with the engine it seems, so they don't really need to be overprotective.
                Hopefully they move to Unreal Engine 5. Should hopefully help them make more stable games.
                    Yup, they announced a bit ago they are moving exclusively to UE5. I hear it’s really good so I’m glad they made that decision. Let Unreal work on the engine while they focus on making a good game.
                        So Witcher 1 remake will be on UE5? Hot damn.
                        Thanks for letting me know. Great news. CDPR being massive means Epic will likely go the extra mile, too, to help brand recognition.
                    That is exactly what they are doing. The Witcher 4 is using it, and is being developed right now
        I mean, they have RedMod

https://www.gog.com/game/cyberpunk_2077_redmod
            If you think Redmod is user friendly for New - Mid/Experienced modders you're out of your damn mind. I've made mods for Bethesda games for 20 years. I've spent quite sometime looking at my options for making gameplay / immersion related mods for Cyberpunk 2077 and come to the conclusion that it's just not worth the amount of effort it'd take.

It is pain stakingly obvious if you even take a glimpse at NexusMods for Cyberpunk 2077 that the amount of Gameplay / Immersion / New Quests / New Weapons / New Location / Animation / Bug Fixes mods are absolutely miniscule compared to just Cosmetic clothing and photo mode mods. Add that to a pie chart and compare it to any bethesda release with a CK / XEdit attached to it.

We need something in the form of XEdit and even 1/4th of what Creation Kit offers for 2077 but I just don't think that's going to happen. I don't think CDPR cares THAT much about the mod scene to pull enough budget to make that happen for longevity. There are many engine and design choices that most likely also hold this back from being a possibility as well. It's great for a first step but since CDPR had prior experience with mod tools I was hoping that eventually we'd have modding tools that were way more **user friendly** by now.
                >We need something in the form of XEdit and even 1/4th of what Creation Kit offers for 2077 but I just don't think that's going to happen. I

Yep.  I'm an utter numpty and I was able to make FO4 mods with CK and xedit after watching a few short videos.  They are very approachable and powerful tools.
            That's not enough. We need RedKit, [which was released in the past for TW2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVcMiSIopsw).
            Map editor would rock. We should fill all the buildings with stuff.
                Some modders are already trying to do that. Like the Megabuilding projects mods.
                AMM on Nexus disguises itself as a simple photo-mode enhancer but actually lets you spawn [i believe permanent] objects into the game world, as well as NPCs you can path-animate.
                    Not quite what i'm after. I'd like new interior spaces in buildings that currently don't even have functional doors or windows and later on those spaces could be filled with people, companies, quests etc.
            Redmod is a rebrand of wolvenkit which is the community made modding tools for TW3 and 2077. So yep, it’s quite bad as CDPR hired modders instead of doing what they did with TW2 and promised for TW3 (but never delivered), redkit.
                It's still more than we get for almost any AAA game. But I also don't care enough to like argue about it; mods currently do what I need them to do.
                    Still, we don’t really get anything more than other AAA games modding. Redmod is just shit for an official modding tool.
        They probably shouldnt do this lest they send a message to their executive board who thinks its a smart idea to finish half baked games to just be fixed with mods like Bethesda is doing it seems.
        No, let them fix their own bugs and imperfections
            Why not both? (also there aren't going to be any more major patches, so they won't)
                We don't need another Bethesda
                    Actually, I think we could use more devs who are as open to modding as Bethesda. Modders can do thinks professional devs don't really have space to, from niche pet projects to potentially controversial options that many would be asking for a toggle to turn off. 

Bethesda modding is not just bug fixes, and many (of my favourite) mods are things Bethesda would've never implemented. 

Having a game with focused vision as a baseline that devs provide full toolkit for so players can add or remove features as it fits them could make for a perfect game.

People say that not every game has to be for everyone... but with wide embrace of modding, they could be.
        Ah yes perfect solution to start releasing 3/4 of a game.
    I really hope they make a sequel that still takes place in Night City. That way less time and effort is wasted on creating a new game world and they can just work on improving the solid foundation they've built. There's so much they can do with the current city we have that would still feel fresh such as the countless interiors they can expand on and let us explore.

That would free them up to giving us a bunch of cyberware that physically changes our appearance, improving combat (especially melee), designing new weapons, and improving the NPC and enemy AI. But most of all I'd like for them to give us a 3rd person option with good animations for combat and traversal.
        Me too one of the biggests dissapointments i had from the game is that they promised a more vertical oriented game, that while the map wasnt more bigger than the Witcher 3 everything was going to be more vertical visiting interiors like Judge dredd megacity blocks, highlines and buildings to explore with content on them, instead except for some scripted events everything is locked at ground level or a third outmost, hope if there is a second game they focus on that.
            Sounds like Dogtown is supposed to be exactly what you're describing. So we should get a pretty good idea of what CDPR is capable of for their next Cyberpunk title.
            Yeah the main issues with the game won’t be solved by fixing bugs
        In my opinion, the game has good amount of weapons and it seems to me that no game has good NPC AI (I have never seen someone saying a game has good enemy AI, it's always mentioned to state that it is bad). Before cyberware physically alters the character, I think it should alter gameplay first including the UI (Nier Automata approach).  
I hope Nivalis comes out good and a sequel to Cyberpunk takes inspiration from that. Night City was and still is dead inside with only a select activities to do. I can't believe they changed the game so much and still I am stuffing bottles of alcohol into my pockets for some reason. I can't believe that whenever I go to a bar or a restaurant, there is a dubbed character behind the stall that opens menu and that's all.
            The Halo games under Bungie definitely received well deserved praise for their enemy AI, as did TLoU 2 and P1 Remake. Halo CE was revolutionary in that regard and still receives high praise to this day for what it accomplished. There are plenty of other examples I can't be bothered to list right now. As for NPCs, any improvements would be welcome, they still pale in comparison to GTA V NPCs for example, and that's a game from 2013.

I agree that cyberware should improve in more ways than just altering physical appearances, that's just what I'm more focused on I guess. Seeing the way every character in the series other than V gets chromed out due to their implants was always a letdown.
            > (I have never seen someone saying a game has good enemy AI, it's always mentioned to state that it is bad

Have you played Halo? Those games are practically the gold standard for enemy AI. They are smart and tactical, care about their own lives (unless it’s an enemy that explicitly shouldn’t, like aliens going berserk or trying to suicide bomb you), work in groups, maintain pressure on the player, etc. Really highly recommend the Bungie games.

FEAR is famous for having very intelligent, tactical enemy AI. It’s on par with Halo, in my opinion. 

Hitman and Metal Gear Solid V are also really good ones.
                >FEAR is famous for having very intelligent, tactical enemy AI. It’s on par with Halo, in my opinion. 

FEAR did an excellent job of making it seem like they were far smarter than they were as well. Their call-outs being so specific to what you were doing and their ability to spot your flashlight made them feel like a real threat. 

Overall terrific game and it's a shame the sequels never could reach the same height.
                FEAR also had the benefit of tuning the AI specifically to interact the level design. This combination made them seem way more intelligent than they were.

Halo is an interesting one because Bungie originally was making Halo as an RTS when they switched to a shooter. So the enemy AI is using RTS in combination with really reactive behaviors specific to their species and rank.
                I never played Halo but I remember FEAR having good AI. I never thought Hitman and MGSV AI as good though. Bad AI thing seems coming up more and more nowadays. I kind of don't understand it because even on Youtube there are people developing AI models to play games efficiently. In the age they should have advanded AI instead of basic min-max strategies, we seem to see more and more games with bad AI though. (I assume the Halo with good AI is also old too, like I said never played)
                All good callouts. I remember the AI in Red Faction: Guerilla being pretty damn good too. Maybe not on par with Halo or FEAR, but considering they had to deal with almost everything in the world being destructible, it was pretty impressive. I never saw them bug out and they would make interesting tactical choices that made them pretty difficult.
                I've heard as well that STALKER accidentally made really effective enemy AI just by programming it to find cover and flank or something.
            STALKER has great NPC AI. It's also ukrainian slav magic 9000 on X-Ray engine, made in the 2000s. But they live on their own, follow missions, fight other NPCs dynamically, pick up items that actually appear into their inventory, etc...

I completely agree on the lack on interactibility of the game. You just have the core gameplay loop of combat encounters, sometimes with story elements. But nothing else. The game world doesn't react to what you do either. It feels lifeless.

I really liked Yakuza on that aspect. You go karaoke, play golf, fish, drink at bars, everything has cutscenes or minigames, everything has a substory (usually funny or with a moral behind it). Every street has different, recognisable shops and light signs, or greeter NPCs.

It would be a time drain to do it as well on the huge map of Night City. And I honestly believe it's size is part of the game's problems. They should have made it smaller, more dense and packed.
                After playing 2.0 couple of hours, I was just looking for Yakuza games to play before reading your comment.
    They still patch the Witcher every now and then
        Oh for sure. I'm just wondering how much work some of these fixes will require. CP2077 has been a weird project for them.
    >The underwater shadow is something else, though. That's crazy looking.

He's just doing underwater Jutsu, leave my boy Vruto outta this.
    The video is misleading. If you block only a part of the sidewalk NPC will now manouever their way to the destination.

The guy in the video just blocked the whole sidewalk and in that situation NPC will turn back.
        I wouldn't call that misleading. I'd call that weird AI still. I'd expect them to stop and yell at me for blocking their path.
    I would expect that to ride on how well Phantom of Liberty does.

The NPCs detect the blocked path, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to add a walk around, jump over, flee, or even aggro, depending on the NPC type or affiliation.

I still would love a proper 3rd person mode when not in combat. Every time I ride a bike I get reminded it would be so cool to have.
    I don’t mind some of the funnier bugs staying in. Yesterday I ran someone over and they were stuck standing up inside my engine.
    If this dlc is the last one for this game, I think the updates will end here, because for two years it is done so little that the developers and 5 years will not be enough to fix everything they promised (subway, garage, car upgrades and much more...)

I'm loving everything about 2.0 but I wish there was:

\- a way to swap to your cyberware arms, like gorilla arms or mantis blades. you could do that before, but now you have to manually open the weapon wheel to select them  


\- more hair options. maybe just have all hair not locked for the corresponding sex  


\- a way in photo mode to insert Johnny Silverhand or other characters of your choice

\- field of view slider on console
    [deleted]
        console, ps5. hence why I said a FOV slider
    Definitely agree on the hair point. Just unlocking the styles would do wonders for character creation. I'm so fucking tired of male V having long hair only to hide his Vegeta hairline
    Well they did add hair! Theres like 20 new ones or something, largely thr afro hairs.
    You can press 4 to bring out the mantis blades, but being able to scroll to them feels more natural
    Auto driving on cars! Why don't they have this? Self driving cars are canon in the game.
    Yeah it sucks being kitted with preem cyberware, but always have to manually open the menu each time just to use it on console.
    [deleted]
        100% Why bother with an in-depth character creator and tons of clothing choices when we never see our character except in photo mode or in mirrors. I don't buy the "it's fur da immershen!" excuse either. I think it was one more thing sacrificed to get the game shipped on the timetable they wanted.   


I know some people love first person but just make it switchable like Bethesda does in their games.
            No.

There are times where >!you see yourself to show you're not you anymore!< or >!silver hand in the mirror!< which would have such little impact if it was third person as you can see >!who you are physically.!<
                Small trade off to actually be able to see the character I spent so long designing in the CC and the clothes she is wearing. Also, this is a personal thing but I think melee combat in games works a lot better in 3rd person view. It's hard for it not to look silly in first person.
                    > Small trade off 

no wonder stories are becoming milque when something that huge to the story is "a small trade off"
    I agree but unfortunately they decided to cater to the GTA crouch and focus on vehicle combat/police chases
That shadow cracked me up :D
    Same haha, had never noticed it was this bad before, and that it's worse now is hilarious
    >For some reasons NPC's die instantly when punched.

Me: OOOONNNNEEEEE PUUUUUUUUUUUUNCH!
[https://imgur.com/a/9pVz6E9](https://imgur.com/a/9pVz6E9)   


hmmm
    Maybe OP had arm mods or something? Not sure. Also did that homeless person parry you? lol
        Yeah I noticed this wasn’t the same experience as my own. NPC’s reacted to my grenades and punching them was just like your link.
            OP also used a different grenade than the one they used in the "BEFORE" vid
                That was anti-personnel grenade used in the OP video and I think that's the difference.
                Your point? They should still get out the car and run at the sight of imminent danger.
                    My point being that one boom boom grenade can be different that spec ops hight grade grenade of imminent nearby destruction of dealing damage out of nowhere.

Also different NPCs have different reactions to stuff like that.
                        Nah bro, it shouldn't matter what kind of grenade it is, the fact to the matter is that is a grenade, something that's dangerous, something they should be programmed to run away from or at least be frightened by despite what type of damage it does.

Don't go this far just to excuse what's obviously an oversight from the devs.
    They did say while sprinting tho
    wth was that delay after the punch, people were processing the impact still lmfaoooooo
        well the delay was only on 1 NPC
            i saw on the stairs one, the second one had a little, and the third one took like a week to realize she was punched in the head
NPC's don't die when you punch them, I'm not sure what's wrong with OPs game but that just doesn't happen
    He probably simply deals too much damage with his fists
        That person’s V is just Saitama
    They just don't get one-shot anymore (unless you are very overpowered). That was in the change notes. All NPCs are now at your character level instead of lvl 1. I'm only lvl 8 right now and it takes like 6 punches to kill an NPC or 3 head shots with a tier 1 pistol. 

Also seems they applied it to inanimate objects, too, since now I have to pump 9 assault rifle shots into a speaker to get it to die, when one used to do the trick.
        Well... that's interesting. Thanks for the info lol

Cyberpunk 2077 Release vs Patch 2.0 | Physics and Details Comparison
https://youtu.be/ar3LeXoVE1A
"The Main Character" is a lot longer than just typing on "V".
Should just turn shadows off underwater if they aren't going to fix it. It's just distracting
    To be honest, out of a 100 hour playthrough, how much time are you really going to spend looking at your shadow while swimming under water?
        exactly, so why doesn't CDPR just turn it off
            Maybe it's not as simple as just flipping an off switch?
        You can't just keep saying stuff like this for every detail though, at some point you got an unpolished game in your hands and you have to admit it.
            I read an intersting article talking about game developement and the problem how as games get more and more realistic the gamers come to expect even more and how the smallest issues can badly affect the games immersion the more relasitic they become. But at the same time they cant possibly make everything perfect on games that are so large with budget and time restraint considerations.

The underwater elements are a tiny percentage of the overall gameplay. At the end of the day remember its just a game lol.
            You are correct....for things that players sees the most I agree. However underwater swimming shadows...not so much.

Sorry your experience is unpolished but I'm having a blast!
"Unfortunately the AI is still not the best"

Yeah, but have you seen the drivers in my city? Spot on, lol
The little details are what I live for lol. One of the reasons why GTA 4/5, RDR 2, CDPR's own Witcher 3 are in my favourites are because they're packed with a ton of nice little details that just add so much immersion to the game.
    Ya GTA 5 and RDR 2 really spoil the player with the little details that you don't even really notice until you play a game that doesn't have them
        GTA5 I'd much, much less detailed than its predecessor, sadly. So many good things from gta4 was cut
        One thing I would like to add to RDR2 and it's physics: it's the first game I ever played where I felt that objects have mass. Like when you hotige someone and put their body on the horse, or when you are in a fistfight or a gunfight. You can feel that the things happening in the world have weight and force like in real life.

I mean a few people here mentioned GTA 4 and how it was ahead of its time. Yes, sure its ragdoll physics is even superior to GTA 5 where the later is much more arcadish, moreover, compared to RDR2, in GTA 4 the objects doesn't feel like they have mass.
    If you get the chance, give Saints Row 2 a whirl if you like that sort of stuff. It's a bit dated by today's standards, but there's always something new to find in the city. There's loads of interiors and the NPCs are always doing stuff, either interacting with the world or getting up to stupid shit. It's also got some of the most advanced customization you've ever seen in a video game, even by today's standards. There are also tiny details, for example, if you hear a radio ad that a store is having a sale, and then go to the store, they are in fact having a sale.

The best way to play it currently is on xbox, either og 360 or with back-compat, but xenia does a pretty good job on PC with only a few minor hiccups graphically. Once you get it set up and the correct options set, that is. The PC port is a trainwreck worse than launch Cyberpunk in terms of bugs/stability, but there are mods to mitigate the worst of the issues. There was supposed to be a patch, but with Volition closing down who knows if that will still happen.
        Played SR2 in 2020 for the first time and it def holds up well. Its old now, but its a game that was made to be *a game* so it rides a good line between whats realistic to see, and whats fun to play. As a huge fan of the open world crime game genre it was one of the last that I played and it still shot up to my top 5 past tons that came after it.

Their NPCs are some of the best because they have so much variety in what they do and who they are. Old people using walkers, couples doing PDA, pimps actually pimping, college students protesting, etc. And then you go spray shit on a govt building, get hit by a car and fly 200ft and toss people into trash trucks for fun. And the story is still some top tier drama.

I thought SR2 stans were overhyping it for so long but SR2 still stands alone in its genre. One of the only things thats lived up to the hype for me.
            There's just so much weirdly obsessive attention to detail in the world. Something a lot of games don't spend a ton of time on (even the later Saints Row entries) because the assumption is that players don't notice it. And while a player may not explicitly sit there and go "wow look at that old person towing around their oxygen cart" or "wow look at all of the mall goths in the mall" it all adds up to an underlying feeling that the world is real. Which is why despite the dated, stiff animations and graphics, SR2's Stilwater is still one of the best open world cities ever.

I think the key takeaway from SR2 is that the NPCs, even random peds, are *agents* in the world, not just scenery. They may visit a store to do some shopping. They may interrupt your shopping trip by holding the cashier at gunpoint. In shitty parts of town the cashier might fight back. They'll lean up against a wall and have a smoke, start playing a drum kit outside. They'll go to play pool or piano. Hell, they'll even drive drunk. Two peds might intrude on each other's personal space and start fighting. The cops may escalate a situation with a random pedestrian until a full-on riot has started. Gangs get in wars with each other and the cops. You might have an NPC run into the garage and flash you while you're working on your car.

Cyberpunk has added a lot of stuff to this tune between 1.5 and 2.0, and it's certainly welcome, but a lot of it is still powered by scripted events. A few chosen NPCs are spawned to do the thing, and all of the rest of them are glorified scenery with no individual agency. In SR2, the NPCs dynamically interact with each other and with scripted event triggers around the world. Hell, if you leave the game AFK, eventually your player character will start acting as an NPC and seek out the nearest scripted activity until you come back. More than once I came back from a piss break to my player leaning against a wall smoking a cig or playing bouncer outside a club.

Praise aside, though, the game does have a few spots of... questionable mission design. Giving the AI access to heat-seeking missiles may not have been the best idea.
            SR 2 had some amazing details. Last I played I found a house you could enter near the water front that had a random ass cypher battle with beatboxers and all. It was wild and ruined gta5 and following SR games for me entirely
    > CDPR's own Witcher 3 are in my favourites are because they're packed with a ton of nice little details that just add so much immersion to the game.

ah yes, the famously detailed Witcher 3 .. where there about 12 different voice lines in the open world that repeated endlessly, a bunch of NPCs you couldn't talk to, tons of doors you couldn't open, and a whole host of combat mechanics you never, ever needed to use because the game was piss easy
        >ah yes, the famously detailed Witcher 3

yes, the famously detailed witcher 3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xT9ZnmA3h0&list=PLMpNwDjXWh0wH-pQvAeulaTXA7\_mgbt8Y
        That's the exact same feeling I have toward Witcher 3, I gave this game 2 tries, first I got to like 60-70% of main story and stopped playing for like a year or 2 and came back to finish main story and Heart of Stone but couldn't last more than couple hours in the Blood and Wine, this game is so damn easy, you don't need to use like 90% of the things you have access to, put Quen on and just whirl through, story wise this game is good but that's not the only thing I'm looking for in an RPG
NPC turned into soccer players
    It makes sense. If you get punched in the spine by someone with pistons for arms, I don't think you'll be standing.
        funny thing is that they dont die from 1 hit lol https://imgur.com/a/9pVz6E9
            They made a change that removes NPC 1-hit protection.  Pre-2.0 you could never kill an NPC in a single hit, but now you can if you deal enough damage.
        [deleted]
            Pistons for arms and subdermal armor are both things that exist in the world of the game, though. No one gets one-shotted by a low level V, you have to upgrade the character for the effect in the video. That's no different than any other RPG.
    I hate it. The instant death NPCs was one of the worst things about GTA V. You can't have much open world reactivity if the NPCs aren't able to react to things because a small breeze knocks them out.
        https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/16p6ovm/cyberpunk_2077_2020_vs_2023_comparison/k1ptif3/
        It's only some situations that your character does knock an npc out immediately with a punch, most of the time they'll fall, get up and run away or fight back, and some npcs even dodge your punch and hit back. You clearly haven't tried punching npcs enough
        You can only instant death NPCs in normal combat by commiting your stats and implants to it, though.
Fantastic effort!

This should be something everyone working on bug fixing at CDPR should just check out and go through it one by one to make further improvements to the issues bit by bit.
    After Phantom Liberty, we can maybe expect a minor patch here and there, but I think they’re probably going to start reallocating the remaining devs onto future titles.

If stuff like NPC pathing still hasn’t been fixed 3 years later, I really don’t think we’ll see it in this game. 

Thankfully I think a lot of this logic is much easier to implement in Unreal Engine. They won’t have to build massive frameworks for stuff like NPC AI from scratch either.
        It's irritating how some youtubers are pushing this update as being a complete overhaul of the game and everything is fixed.

This game still seems as dead as at launch.There's nothing interactable in the world, only menus and wooden npc.
    It is fantastic effort, and the devs have done amazing, but this just further highlights how the managers and bean counters at CD had completely lost touch with reality.

Even 2.0 has bugs and mechanics that aren't acceptable for a AAA game at release.
        Like what
            Halfway in the video were mostly bugs
            The game isn't done until they add in the female V from the early trailers as one of the presets.
            Actually look at the vid it highlights the bugs
                I am talking what's 'not acceptable'
I didn't get to finish this game before 2.0 I have like one mission left. Kinda wish I did one playthrough before this. Honestly it makes me feel some type of way...
    You did finish it
        Yeah, it depends on what he means by "one mission." Technically, after fighting Smasher, there's still a mission, but it's just an epilogue. I actually stopped playing after beating Smasher because I already knew how the game ended and didn't need to see the epilogue (I could just watch it on Youtube).
    You can download the pre-2.0 version if you just want to finish it up before going to 2.0.

Edit: At least on GOG. Dunno if you can do it on Steam.
    I mean, it's not like you didn't have time dude. You're the one to blame for this.
        I know, I fucked up. Oh well it has its pros and cons I guess.
    I finally beat the game day of update. Didn't open Steam and launched directly from exe. Updated right after.
I don’t get why burnout popping tires is a big deal.
    It’s the shrinking horse balls all over again
        what a banger of a sentence
        how often is that mentioned in this sub lol
    Now that there's car cashes and vehicular combat, it can matter. 

Before? Just one of many many things that broke immersion. Any one of them wasn't a big deal, but when it continued to add up with all of these elements, it was difficult to get immersed without something breaking it.

EDIT: I now realize the OP I was talking to was talking about burnout not shooting them out... Oops.
        What about popping tires while doing a burnout  breaks immersion...... You have any idea how hard it is do that in real life? Why are you doing never ending burnouts in a single player game like 2077 with no audience?
            I don’t understand or respect people that do them in real life with an audience either so hey.
    There's a lot of things that people cry and whine about like its the end of the world that they feel like should be in the game that, in the grand scheme of things, doesn't really matter to the overall experience with this game.
        Absolutely factual.
        Like police chases....
        Agree, like I just want to play pachinko minigame :(

totally not needed for core gameplay though
        I want something very silly and simple. I want eating animations.   


The game puts such a focus on food and food vendors and cooking animations, etc. -- I wish the food items weren't just bland consumables in your inventory. I wish you could sit at a food stall and chow down on some noodles.   


It's stupid, I know. But it would make a huge difference to me.
    As if we don't have better materials in 2077
    Idk about you but in GTAV I was aiming for the tires every time I was in vehicle combat. It's fun to make the cars crash lol
        I'm  just talking about burnout popping, I'm happy they added bullet popping.
            Oh mb
    It's because people wanted this game to be 'future GTA-V', which is why most of these are just GTA features. If you aren't into GTA that much, none of them are really that big of a deal.
    its just a precedent set by other games
        By games you mean racing games where it's kind of expected and GTA where it was novelty when people found out about it now nobody really gives a shit.

It's not a big deal at all. It's a deal for like 1% of players lmao.
            It's actually not realistic to pop tires by shooting them because it doesn't happen in real life. The bullet only pass through. It was tested before. 

Only if you overinflate damaged tires they will pop.
The car stopping when you jumped out actually made sense. Current cars can recognize when someone is in the seat for the seat belt indicator. It's not too far off that in the future cars could realize the driver has left the seat and engage the brake. I work on commercial vans and some even go into park automatically if you are rolling under a certain speed or if the door is even opened. That honestly just seems like a future society safety feature.
    Safety features? In MY futuristic dystopian game? No thank you.
    I guess it would depend on the maker, popping the brakes just because the driver sensor say no does not mean being safe, the car should have some kind of AI to decide that
        Well yeah not saying it's the same primitive weight sensor in 2077 but just saying the idea they stop when the driver gets ejected isn't too far fetched and kinda cool.
Why is more than half of this largely worthless sim content instead of a comparison of actual substantial changes?

The swimming shadow animation isn't a serious concern.
    Because people made a very big deal about the small things. That's what this video is about, not the big stuff
Listen, I know this isn’t fair to compare CP2077 to RDR 2 entirely but when you talk about immersion you should.

I wish they spent more time revamping the Immersion aspect of the game, because in some areas it’s even worse than it already was. Police system revamped and looks significantly better but could be improved even more. Portions of the map look populated but still, nothing in comparison to the 2018 demo. 

Not just the immersion but those little picky things. I really hoped with 2.0, it would be an entirely different game not just new builds to play through. I’m happy but unhappy at the same time with this patch and I doubt they’ll spend more time improving it before they move onto TW4. 

Bug fixes are present and I’m glad but yeah, my point still stands. I’m sure many will disagree with me as this is a Cyberpunk subreddit but still a brilliant game but it could’ve been so much more.
    I mean in 2018 CDPR said that Cyberpunk "will be as polished and refined as RDR2" so they invited the comparison on themselves
    It's not like RdR2s police system was very good.

And for that game they spent alot of time on details but barley made any gameplay improvements in terms of combat since the last one.


And don't get me started on how empty the world feels.
        Yeah RDR2 also suffered from police spawning
        God the police in rdr2 was do bad it stopped me playing it more than the one time. Hijack train, park in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, cops show up before you even rob it, ????. Also getting bounties while wearing masks made 0 sense. Too bad really, because I love that game but that shit is just a deal breaker and knowing Rockstar it'll never get a patch because it's singleplayer
    Im gunna be real. The police shouldn't have even been touched if it weren't for the outraged. The games focus and setting doesn't have a police focus unlike gta does. Where crime is the central narrative. Police in cyberpunk are more akin to city guards in witcher. There to add character to the city, surface level interaction and funnel u or block u off from missions.

Sure u could interact with them and fight them for immersion,  but that shouldn't have been such a loud focus
        It's not even 'adding' characters to the city. They feel more like a placeholder like; just put them in there for the sake of it. I understand, I'm just baffled by how they changed the genre of this game. It was advertised as one thing then before the release as other.
            >I'm just baffled by how they changed the genre of this game.

Because games aren't finalized until they're released? How is this so hard to understand? There's another commenter in here saying they were "sold" on the game back in 2013 when they saw the initial teaser trailer. SEVEN YEARS before the game released they had formed an idea of what the game was in their head. Then when the game released as something else, it was the developers fault.

Cyberpunk feels *exactly* like The Witcher 2/3 feel. It isn't even a little bit surprising that this is how they made their game.
                > SEVEN YEARS before the game released they had formed an idea of what the game was in their head. Then when the game released as something else, it was the developers fault.

This is such revisionism. The devs spent those 7 years talking about features that would never make it into the game. The hype over this game was absolutely down to what CDPR was telling players it was going to be. Dont pretend this games release wasnt one of the biggest controversy in gaming , its only been 3 years, memory spans arent that short. Well, maybe yours is.
                    >The devs spent those 7 years talking about features that would never make it into the game.

Yes, that is literally how game development works. Like how there was a functioning metro system until they play tested it and got negative feedback, so they replaced it with a fast travel system.

>The hype over this game was absolutely down to what CDPR was telling players it was going to be.

But this is on the players, no?  This isn't Sean Murray going on TV saying, "Yes, No Man's Sky will have multiplayer" and then the game releases and it turns out he was lying through his teeth. This is pretty typical, "Here's what we're aiming for." They fell short on some things and changed or improved other things. But at the end of the day it wasn't the next GTA or RDR2, which is what people wanted and expected, so players shit on it.

>Dont pretend this games release wasnt one of the biggest controversy in gaming...

Well sure, but largely because it was a technical disaster for consoles. Not because it was some hollow shell of a game that didn't do what it meant to do. I mean the gameplay loop is essentially the exact same today as it was at launch. There's been no big changes in quests, NCPD scanner events, gigs, hidden gems, life paths, branching quests, romanceable NPCs, etc. All of this released more or less as it was intended to be.

Vehicle combat, updated skill trees, more guns, all of these are cool but don't functionally change what this game is and has always been. People coming in here saying that it still isn't GTA or that *now* the game is playable is so bizarre to me. These people are saying they won't play the game for what the game was meant to be until it becomes what they want it to be. Such entitlement.
                        Its funny, people blame the marketing but I've heard people tell me they thought this game was gonna be like the Witcher, Mass Effect, Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, GTA, bioshock, etc.  Which are all very different games. And also it was gonna have the narrative freedom of Disco Elysium! (which disco itself can only do due to the very small scale).

&nbsp;

And for giggles when I asked them where they got this idea most of them linked me back to the same videos that said nothing of the sort.  ALOT of heavy interpretation going on lol
    I'm with you. I had high hopes for the patch and it's welcome, but it didn't address the fundamental reasons why the game's immersion still feels like a PS2 game. Shame, because the world is so big and beautiful and the story was decent. But the zombie NPCs really do ruin it.
at launch, I felt the following issues:

- graphical glitches EVERYWHERE 
- crowds didn’t feel life like. A lot of duplicate NPCs and exact same reactions at exact same time. Very uncanny valley 
- actual bug during a mission which prevented me from going forward. Had to load an earlier save. 
- driving felt really bad
- performance was poor. I couldn’t ultra 60fps on 3080 


I’m so happy that Alll the above issues are completely fixed and I’m having such a good time in 2.0
yeh open world AI is still meh, also I hate that Cop AI assumes im responsible for anything by default, if someone shoots a cop because I hid behind him, cop just starts blasting me, shame

maybe through mods we will get something closer to GTA interaction, 1 can hope
    Ah, you noticed it too. If i involve myself in a gang vs cop fight and fight the gang, suddenly i'm public enemy number one.

Same if there's a cop on a street corner and a gang opens up on me, that's somehow my fault too?
        I'm actually wondering if this is a bug because it wasn't like this before 2.0 police scan jobs actually have the cops chase you now too which doesn't seem like it'd be on purpose
            Hopefully it gets sorted
        gta vice city was ahead of its time
        I don't think the real life police would be happy with you if you randomly involved yourself in their work, even if it's helping them
    But you are literal serial killer. Why would they not shoot you?
        stop the copium, open world AI is still meh at best.

If someone shoots a cop, but the cop started blasting you as a reaction to that, it means AI is shit and not some mental gymnastics justifying unintended behaviour.
Deus ex human revolution cops blast whoever attacks them and not you by default... its not some revolutionary feature.

Also its not something that ruins the experience, but its still immersion breaking if it happens
The NPC and police AI are the things that broke the game's illusion the most to me and part of why I stopped playing until the big update. I'm replaying now and I'm glad police don't insta-spawn anymore. Hopefully over time they still make improvements to the AI and don't stop improving just because everyone accepts the 2.0 update.
    Yeah, but i noticed of I try and help out the police, the second I open fire, they all turn red.  I don't know if that's intended, but I dislike it immensely.
        i did help out a police officer yesterday after patch, in pacifica i saw police having a shootout with the scavs and i killed the scavs and then the police guy thanked me. so it is there, you might've hit a policeman by ricochet or something
            Yes i think police turn on you if you hurt a civilian. I kinda like it because i cannot just be throwing grenades when a civilian or a hostage is near. I have to pick them apart without hurting innocents or else the police will come after you.
        I mean if you walked up to an active police shoot out and started blasting people irl I’m pretty sure the cops would shoot you too lol.
    What illusion? The gameplay loop is not GTA and revolves around engaging with the police.

Name one main/side mission in the game in which you are directly fighting/running away from the police by design? 

This was the problem with some of the criticism at launch. Many people thinking this was supposed to be GTA: Night City.

Unfortunately as a result, there was MUCH MORE that CDPR could have focused on but instead decided to focus on a feature to appease the GTA crowd.
This game just made me appreciate Rockstar games more. The open world and level of detail will never be on their level. If you ignore all of that though and just focus on the story, it’s a decent game.
    Yea, but rockstar games aren't RPGs either. They can focus  their time on detail when you dont have to incorporate a skill system, multiple dialogue options for the protagonist, and many other ways  that characters can interact with your world. You are one protagonist that Rockstar can model their game after, not multiple different players with different builds etc.

I feel like Im on rails with Rockstar games, which is great because they always tell a great story, but I like to have some freedom in BGS games/CDPR games at the sacrifice of detail in the world.

I mean, you can tell RDR2 dev time was mainly spent on how detailed the world was, but combat was shallow, you couldnt create your own character, and your character had no real "skills" or customization other than cosmetic.

Still, two great games IMO, just depends on your taste.
        Also Rockstar games have almost no choices in their story, absolutely zero consquences and branching quests, no different approach to solving most quests, the combat system is guns/very simple melee/explosives, absolutely no abilities to deal with and their balance, no items with their stats and balancing, no cyberware, etc. So it's very easy for them to make sure that the world feels alive if all of the stuff above they don't have to do.

People compare CP2077 to GTA V or RDR 2 don't mention the latter games have no skill tree, not even different dialogue choices, no RPG-style loot, no levels, no abilities, no balancing, and so on and so on. It's like Cyberpunk has to be on their level while simultaneously adding a whole layer of games systems that RPGs have.
        Imagine Rockstar and CDPR teaming up.

Rockstar focusing on open world.

CDPR focusing on combat.

???

Profit.
            Can't say CDPR does combat particularly well (all the Witcher games are wonky as fuck).
                Still better than shooting/cover gameplay of GTA
        RDR2 DEFINITELY has RPG elements on another level compared to past titles. Either way, it doesn’t matter. I just wish CDPR implemented the most basic of fucking features for open world titles that Rockstar has set the standard for. 

It doesn’t need to be a GTA clone. Just fucking implement what is expected of an open world title in 2020. Its infuriating.
    Open world. Free roam but linear storyline and progression. So mostly sandbox fun

Thats rockstar


Open world. Free roam. But action RPG with leveling, dialogue, multiple ways to complete missions, cater to different user builds etc etc

Thats cyberpunk


Ppl go oh it's an open world game with guns and cars. Let's compare it with gta. It's not even comparable. It's more compatible with skyrim but replace horses with cars
    RDR2 ruined Open World games for me. After seeing everything work so perfectly, it's hard to go back. 

Everything else feels so lifeless. 

I wish they could sell their NPC AI tech.
        For me, what made RDR2 special was the texture.

When you buy things from the store, you walk up to the shelf and grab them. Or thumb through a product catalogue physically placed on the counter.

When you clean your gun, there's an animation. When you eat food, there's an animation. Skin an animal? Animation.

In Cyberpunk, this is silly, I know -- but I want that level of immersion. I want to buy a bowl of noodles from a street vendor, sit down, and eat it... Animations and all.

I just want more texture to the world. It's such a cool setting, and I want to touch it.
            Yeah, I agree with that! There's just so much to it. Everything is made to feel more immersive. They really went as far as possible to remove the "seams" of the game. 

It really is an incredible contribution to gaming. Really takes things to the next level.
        The bounty system and the cops sucked so much ass in rdr2 it was embarrassing. The game was fantastic otherwise, though it could use more random events, or a timer that reset them once in a while.
            Yeah, I'll agree with that. The bounty system was probably the biggest flaw. There were times you attracted heat when it just couldn't be possible.
        Does RDR 2 have:

* level up system,
* different dialogue choices and consequences,
* crafting,
* rpg-style loot with stats,
* skill tree,
* many abilities,
* character customisation,
* different builds,
* different ways of solving the same quest,
* and more typical RPG elements.

All of that takes so much development time Rockstar Games saves in their games. They just have to make main story for their games, like 15-20 guns, a few melee weapons with 2 attack animations per, and a bunch of explosives. After that they call it a day and just can focus on making open world feel believable. No shit Cyberpunk isn't on their level, the game would take 15 years to make.
        RDR2, GTA4 and Watchdogs 2 have some of the best open worlds I've ever played. Not alot of open world games can compare to those 3
    They aren't comparable games or studios.....
    Rockstar has decades of experience and multiple iterations with this type of game. Open worlds are all smoke-and-mirrors and they know exactly where to put their efforts, and where they can cut corners. Cyberpunk plays like a first iteration… because it is!
        Are the Witcher games not considered open world?
            bout to say, witcher 3 is absolutely a version of that open world. just 90% wilderness.
                yea, but also a very limited character powerset, you know one of the few ways geralt can interact with combat and missions.  Cyberpunk has a lot more variety in how you play.   That's always a pain in the ass to design around.
            Only when it fits my narrative
        As well as they like spend decade to make one.

GTA 5 Launches: September 17, 2013
        I mean RDR2 is kinda an exception because the smoke an mirrors is often replaced with just straight up over the top detail.

Like the railway construction crew that slowly works their way linking two lines, you can watch them cut down trees, hammer in each rail segment. The line actually progresses in real time and eventually it completes. This is almost too much detail. It only makes sense for RDR2 because it ties in so deeply to the themes

Also, before the release of RDR2,  TW3 was kinda the gold standard for flavourful world in games. Farmers farming, dock workers in novigrad carrying cargo, people washing clothes, boatyards making boats. It was all smoke-and-mirrors in the sense that none of those systems would progress if you stopped to look at them but nobody was gonna look at them for that long.

Cyberpunk is step back in this sense, very few of the NPC's are doing anything.
            Red Dead Redemption 2 is probably the greatest open world game (in terms of detail and immersion) ever conceived.
        It’s a first iteration on a well-developed concept.  There’s no excuse here.  You gonna stan for Tesla next?
            By a studio that doesn't have Rockstars developers or leads.

Like I wouldn't expect CDPR to make a perfect Mario game out the gate cos they aren't Nintendo.
            That's like saying you should know how to play a sport by reading a book.
            No other game studios did anything remotely closer to Rockstar though. For a first iteration, I would say CDPR did quite well. I was one of the people who was surprised that they were even able to release the game. The make Witcher 1 which is low-production quality passion project. Witcher 2 which cannot even be called an open-world. The Witcher 3 where they build onto the first two games and made something great. And then a first-person action RPG with completely different world and gameplay elements which would definitely be compared to GTA-series. They were crazy even to begin this project.
            > There’s no excuse here.

I dunno, maybe you could point out how Rockstar has thousands of employees, spends half a billion on a game, and is going to go 15 years between GTAV and GTAVI because that's how hard it is to develop a true next gen successor to V?
    considering I never managed to finish GTA V story and beat Cyberpunk a couple of times, yeah, well, I agree, rockstar games' details are crazy but I don't care as I like playing games instead of looking at the traces my boots leave for hours, but enjoy your thing
    I mean if Rockstar ever gets combat and RPG elements to be even 1/10th that of CDPR games, then we'll talk
    It was never meant to compare to GTA. They do different things and focus on different things. 

There are MANY other things CP2077 does better than GTA as well....
    gta hasnt evolved since gta 3 been the same game and quest design , talk to npc follow them to quest area/ shooting gallery repeat. hopefully rockstar changes it up for the next one but im not holding my breath
        GTA V added aspects like planning massive heists over the course of several missions and three main, playable protagonists. It was pretty revolutionary for 2013.
    Maybe old school rockstar but current Rockstar is no different than EA.
        You're comparing GTA Online to EA practices. 

That has nothin to do with their ability to build and create a game. Something they are still masters at
            Not really I think RDR2 and GTA 5 has flaws a lot of flaws that some people over look just because its Rockstar. I definitely have no hope for gta 6 seeing that everyone that made the series what it is left the company. It is definitely going to be preachy
                >It is definitely going to be preachy.

They’ve already talked about how it’s no longer going to "punch down" with its humor like their games have in the past. Which is about as lame to hear from Rockstar as it would be to hear from the creators of South Park or something. It has this arrogant "we are going to be better than our predecessors who built it all" air to it.
                    But it also insinuates that they are above certain people
 The same people they are supposed to fight for its kinda funny
                        Didn’t think about that. That’s a very good and hilarious point.
so you stole this video from somewhere, but reuploaded it to reddits awful media player with super low bit rate
Since 1.5 and 1.6 I could count on one hand how many bugs I had on my series x. Never had a game breaking bug once either.
I’m getting a lot more NPC duplicates right next to each other again, consistent groups of 4-6 next to each other
It should be called "bug" comparison as it is quite limited in scope. You are looking for flaws instead of doing a full comparison like is expected from the title.
Underwater shadow bad, game is, unplayable.
This game isn't a cop and civilian NPC killer simulator. Go play Grand Theft Auto if that's your twisted fetish.
The vehicle combat seems to be the only thing changed here that actually matters. Everything else is small random shit that you would only run into if 
you're the type to go around and mess with the game to see how much it allows. 

That was fun as a kid but as an adult with a very limited amount of time to play games, it's not something I ever find myself doing. Really excited to get into Phantom Liberty and see how all the upgrades to the game systems get folded into the quests and side objectives.
this is useful but only covers a TINY fraction of what's changed in Cyberpunk 2077 since release, which is when I played it (on a good gaming PC with very few issues)

for example I'm VASTLY more interested vehicle combat, and in transmog so I can dress in cool outfits while still having great stats, than I am in the behaviour of pedestrians when I park on the sidewalk which is something I have never even thought about until now lol
The motorcycle shooting looked like they were shooting straight into the air. Otherwise looks cool, might redownload
I don't get this, a lot of these functions, 2.0 didn't add? They where alleeady there.
This guy tested a bunch of shit that I wouldn’t have even thought or worried about lol
I don’t get why everyone is hyping up the 2.0 patch they still released a broken games and it took them this long to actually do anything about it like should we just say every game is a 10/10 because hey they can always update it later who cares when
Is the driving still garbage?
    Much improved imo. I use to hate the handling of the cars. Now it’s really good imo. I enjoy driving in this game now.
    Some cars feel like a dream now and some feel like boats, so kind of the same as before just with different options, they did change how you purchase them though which is nice
    No, the driving is great now.
    The Type-66 cars drive super nice even before the patch. Only vehicle I could actually get from point A to point B without killing a bunch of civilians lol
*Ignores the massive overhaul to combat and talents* 
For real it’s fucking amazing. Grab satori and look around for another surprise
A little misleading of a title as a lot of this was still the case in 2023
[deleted]
    There’s enough videos showcasing all that surely? These comparisons are good. Devs can look at them and say we need to do better.
    Because they're made in bad faith. Is this your first day in this sub? It's been this way for 3 years.
Some of the comments here remind me why people may have had too high of expectations for this game. Wanting it to have all the tiny details of a Rockstar open world action game while also having the depth of a Bethesda RPG was always a very tall order that’s never been done before.
    [deleted]
        Define "immersive open world" in your eyes.

To me Night City and its ambience is pretty immersive.
    Yeah they're bullshitters. Everyone's an entitled critic.
    Many other games have launched successfully with solid basic features and gameplay. Cyberpunk had one of the most pathetic launches in gaming history with an unfinished product and still multiple years later it’s still an unfinished pile of shit. You’re over here complaining that people had “too high of expectations” when in reality people just expected a game to not be unfinished and to not be so fucking broken even after multiple years of patches. Look at Starfield, it lived up to his massive hype and actually feels like it’s in a solid release state on launch. Cry as much as you want in defense of a game you are biased towards, but you’re living too far from reality if you really think the issue is players who expected a game in a finished state not only at launch but also multiple years of patches later. Cyberpunk historically had one of the worst game launches of all time and it’s still in a state that would have gotten heavy criticism if this current version after patch 2.0 was the version at launch.
        Why are you on a CP2077 reddit if you aren't too fond of the game?

Everyone else is celebrating the game now while you remain bitter.
            It's a good question that these people never tend to answer.
        I think Starfield is a great example. It’s missing tons of the “little details” an open world Rockstar game has. And I think most people didn’t expect those in it, but many did for Cyberpunk. I was also comparing people’s expectations of Cyberpunk’s current state still being underwhelming, not launch which was obviously bad.
        lol the game is fine

touch grass
Holy shit, it is cry baby city in here.
    welcome to r/cyberpunkgame, where everyone hates cyberpunk lmfao
    If you want actual constructive conversation: /r/LowSodiumCyberpunk
Some of these things have been fixed or updated for years. Y'all really haven't touched the game in 3 years and come in here acting like the devs haven't made any updates since?
    Read the title, does it say 2020 vs 2023, or does it say “every update made in chronological order with a timestamp”?
        Yeah it's odd imo. People bought it in 2020 and a lot of them returned it. They call it the 2.0 update, hoping to get those people back, so comparing 1.0 to 2.0 seems like it makes sense. I never got the feeling that the video was trying to say "look, they only fixed this issue now."
            OP literally states, "It's fixed now," for some issues that have been fixed for over a year.
                It's ok man reading is hard for a lot of us.
        Maybe watch the video with the comments before making a fool of yourself? OP definitely tries to make it seem like some things which have been fixed for quite a while were only just now fixed with 2.0.
    If they were fixed why is it still in the game? Video doesn't say all of these were fixed or not fixed by this single update, it just shows what's the state of the game
        The one about cops spawning behind you literally hasn't been a thing for years. I get that some of you stepped away from the game due to a bad launch and are just now coming back to it, but stop acting like you know what the state of the game has been these past 3 years.
            This is not about that at all. Just compares launch with 2.0 what else should have compared it to? 1.6 or what? This just shows all the improvement from start, it doesn't matter when it was fixed
            They still teleported in like they were beamed down from the enterprise, just further away.

Or you'd just get drones chasing you.
    Oh cool, so the update fixed even less than advertised lol
The open world and NPC AI are still total bullshit, I really don't understand why they didn't bother fixing these systems/mechanics, too...

Also the new police system is buggy as hell and enemy AI isn't "greatly improved" by a long shot.

Don't get me wrong: 2.0 is GREAT but it seems to me that they mainly focused on reworking the action elements while skipping on basic issues that have plagued the game from the start (QoL, immersion, AI).
It's been 3 years and this sub is still plagued with Rockstar fanboys.
All if not most of these were fixed like a y3ar ago lmao
This subreddit is full of crybabies, 90% of the video is full of things no one will ever notice but the comments are treating it as if it's the worst thing in the world. Game was fantastic before 2.0 and now with the update it's even better, a genuine 10/10.
Crazy, 3 years wait for some of the most basic features to be added. Maybe we'll have a full game by 2077
    Key word there is "some".
    I can't believe people are calling these "great little details". GTA and Saints Row are city sandboxes that had these things figured out 15+ years ago.
    glad to se this sub is still just as trash this mine as well be a gta subreddit
        It was honestly not that bad before Cyberpunk hit the news cycle. Now it's insufferable again.
            The same morons are probably back again.
    Basic features?
        GTA San Andreas, which came out in 2004, figured out how to do shooting out tires and firing while driving. Yes, most these are basic features.
            Another victim of hasty generalization logical fallacy. Most games don't have this sort of features for a reason. It's not basic at all...
            They are very much not basic features for a game. And they are in the game.

They said basic features were Still missing so I ask again. What basic features.
        The vehicle features were in the original ads for the game lol.

These were release features delayed 3 years lmao
            You mean shooting while driving. Because the trailers only showed the scripted car chases which are in the base game.
                Lol no. They showed full vehicle customization and much of the current shit.

Get out of here.

        That was so they could avoid spoilers and copyright strike anybody that does post spoilers - they gave otherwise full freedom to give opinions / reviews from content creators and journalists and it had an average of like 92/100 so far. I'll be very surprised if it turns out to be bad

The original CP2077 launch also got panned before release by reviewers. The game had average like 65/100 before launch in 2020, except for PC where it had good reviews
I’m so glad that obnoxious alert sound is gone!
Still no non-unarmed melee stealth kills :(
Started a new save last night after quitting the game shortly after launch and holy shit is it a completely different experience so far. So much better in every way.
I agree with many of the points here. I.e. the AI at times seems better, other times even more disjointed than it was in i.e. v1.6 or earlier.

Lots of new bugs have been introduced, I noticed too that there's a lot more clipping bugs than before: people clipping through objects like chairs and such, cars clipping through one another, even some of the downtown aerial vehicles seemed to be flying through the corners of some of the buildings!

Also I noticed that some textures just didn't load up correctly anymore, such as when V starts bleeding from the nose and coughing up blood when i.e. talking with Hanako at Embers, the blood wasn't there anymore, nothing is visible (the same type of blood splatter layer seemed to be more absent altogether on multiple occasions? is that a deliberate attempt to bring down the graphic nature of the game, or just a serious screw up with texture loading?)

Johnny's dialogue lines were also cutting up in some of the side missions in 2.0, I tried doing some side gigs I hadn't done like "Killing in the Name" and almost all of Johnny's lines just got cut mid-sentence. I compared to other people's playthroughs and they didn't seem to have that issue in way-back versions.

Feels like some aspects of the game got fixed, others either remained broken or got more broken than what they were.
I wish we could box with the NPCs like GTA4.
Glad Cyberpunk is getting a full overhaul. Sad that it was rushed out so hard that it needed it in the first place but now I have more to look forward to when the dlc comes out
Ordered this game yesterday to play for the first time. Can’t wait!
Were you ever able to run and grapple onto a moving vehicle before because I managed to do it just now?
I like the police radio banter you hear on your scanner when you commit a crime. I haven’t been killing like crazy but there seems to be unique dialogue depending on where you commit the crime. There was a joke about tacos or something.
"Still don't pop out". Well, they're not supposed to. It's actually not realistic to pop tires by shooting them because it doesn't happen in real life. The bullet only pass through. It was tested before. 

If you overinflate damaged tires, then there's a big possibility of popping them.
Honestly most the problems you point out not only did I never noticed pre release or 2.0

But like hard to think of a circumstance we're I would have even noticed or cared.

Like look if I park my car on the side walk the NPC's just turn around and don't just go around!

I'm like when would this ever come up who the hell is parking on side walks and just hanging out?
I swear this video is like a carbon copy of one on yt, like the exception of like one or two things it's the same comparisons in the same order.

It literally is just stolen, they have nearly the same substitutes, like the "some reason civilians die in one punch" and the random switching between side by side to not side by side comparison is also the same.

Link: https://youtu.be/ylS_hIha_gw?si=7aju_FxukVWULUE-
I see it only shows driving in straight lines with minimal turning
Can’t wait for 3.0…
The Police-part gave last-action-hero vibes
Also what about that amazing RT overdrive + DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction that makes me want to lick my OLED in HDR?
Three years, not even the tiniest effort spent on the laughable 2D vehicle and NPC LODs. It's such a ugly thing.
I don't know if it was 2.0 but when Delemain wrecks your car, V does not talk to Johnny as if Johnny has been there for awhile anymore which actually makes more sense
What the fuck is this shit? Who gives a fuck about NPC behavior. Why doesn't this show anything about gorilla arms?

Booooo
Lol people want this game to be GTA so badly. Forget about it, not worth it, as long as the city is believable enough it's fine.
This is the most nitpicky comparison I've ever seen and is full of stuff 90% of people will not see or care about.
    AI behaviour is not nitpicking
        The only AI this video had was citizens being punched (didn't show them being shot which they do react differently to) and citizen driving AI which isn't the focus of the game and isn't that much worse than GTA. Also the video handily leaves out the new cop chase AI which is fucking great and brutal to try and escape on higher wanted levels.

So yes, critisizing citizen ai driving or them being punch (like people are going to fucking do that all the time) is 100% nitpicking.
            Played GTA 4 recently, and this is way way way behind that game in open world crown interaction and reaction on foot and for vehicles.  


Of course rockstar are masters of this stuff, and cyberpunk clearly made a decision to not focus on it nearly as much.
    could not disagree more. small details like this are what make or break immersion and world building, and the attention to minor details is what made rdr2 one of the greatest games of all time

&#x200B;

i am quite happy w 2.0, but this is all a bit disappointing to see lol
        Yeah I don't see how it's bad to be nitpicky. I'm seeing people say the same things on the Starfield sub. I absolutely love that game, but there are definitely a few immersion breaking things that I would have liked to see differently.

Like a big gripe of mine in open world games is that NPCs only exclusively talk in things related to the game world. That's why Rockstar is so good at these things. Sometimes you meet characters who have issues that are not directly related to one of the gangs and talk about things that don't have anything to do with the game's lore.

Cyberpunk definitely seems to have fixed some of those things. One of my biggest complaints at launch was how the city just didn't feel lived in and that's definitely been improved.
        When are you ever going to park your car in the middle of the sidewalk and then sit there to see how watch pedestrian walk around it? This is something that, if it weren’t for this video, the majority will never think about.
            lol that's just a way to test npc pathfinding my friend

&#x200B;

the pathfinding should be there
                Pedestrians aren’t pathfinding in the same way that other npcs are, they are just walking to walk, they don’t have a destination
                You have no clue how game development works
        For every hundred people on Reddit who say this is "important" there are a thousand who don't give a shit or probably don't even know these issues exist.

RDR was an immersive game. So much so that it sacrificed gameplay.  One of its biggest criticisms is that it's slow paced/boring and annoying to play because your character takes 30 seconds to do anything. It was a good game but it was hardly "one of the greatest" give me a break. Way overhyped.
            you're literally the only person i've ever heard say that

&#x200B;

rdr2 is one of the greatest games ever made, and i hate rockstar. and the reception and reaction to all its details when it released proves you wrong entirely.

&#x200B;

what even do you get out of defending mediocrity ?
                It's literally all over Reddit alone if you search for it. 

I'm calling about BS nitpicking. What do you get out of being a negative downer all the time
                    hopefully more details in my games and less silly things that break my immersion
                It is a snoozer, that's a pretty common take. Masterfully done and incredibly boring
                RDR2 greatest game ever made? lol. I agree with the other person. The realism makes the game a snooze fest. I get so bored playing it.
                    Easily in my top 3 but I love a slow burn. I absolutely loved it. Much more than Cyberpunk that's for sure.
                    I've got several friends who can't make it passed 4-5 hours in RDR2 because, "It takes too long to do anything." Some people want to play a video game, not replace their reality.
                        Same for me. I enjoy slow pace games like RPGs and turn based. But I don't want to play a game where I have to wait for long animations to complete to do simple task.
                To be honest, the shooting and combat are pretty meh, especially compared to how amazing the rest of the game is.
                Rdr2 is one of the greatest games ever made yes, but it's not perfect and it's most certainly overhyped.
            >For every hundred people on Reddit who say this is "important" there are a thousand who don't give a shit or probably don't even know these issues exist

I'm sure the ratio isn't as skewed as you're making it out to be. You make it sound like only reddit ever takes issue with a game. 

>RDR was an immersive game. So much so that it sacrificed gameplay. One of its biggest criticisms is that it's slow paced/boring and annoying to play because your character takes 30 seconds to do anything. It was a good game but it was hardly "one of the greatest" give me a break. Way overhyped.

Your opinion isn't as widely shared, going off of how well-received that game was. 

I personally like that everything takes time to do. I'm not in a rush. Folks are free to dislike that. Maybe the game wasn't built for them.
                I know what the ratio is because I now the average evergday person who plays video games in their spare time and doesn't browse the internet every other moment. The people who buy these games and buy FIFA and buy microtransactions all the time. They *do not* care about these "immersive" things or these tiny bugs and issues they will most likely never see. 

A game being critically successful doesn't make it the greatest game of all time. Brother rdr2 didn't even win game of the year. Let me reiterate though, I think it's a great game with a great story and I enjoyed it immensely when I played but it is lacklustre when it comes to gameplay, the single most important thing in a game.
                    Brother, RDR2 won tons of game of the year awards, just not the one from the game awards. It may not be your personal opinion but it widely regarded as one of the best games of all time. A quick google search will show you that it is indeed, regarded by many, as such.
    I disagree completely the game has been out for three now things like the pedestrian AI or the underwater animation are an issue and affect immersion but are simple fixes I hope
        you almost never see the underwater shadow, though I'm not denying it's ugly as fuck
        Underwater (shadow) animation is ultra minor, as you barely ever spend time underwater, not to mention looking for your own shadow there. But NPCs AI was and still will be very noticeable.
            Barely spend time underwater = you don't need to fix it?
                Literally yes. There is a thing called priorities in game dev and that is literally at the bottom of the list for a game that has like three side missions that involve water.
                Basically, it makes it less important than other, bigger issues.

Like Pedestrian AI.
                    Yes, but still on the list. A very long list. Even though game is fun and all
        The underwater shadow is a very hard thing to fix, V's anim rig is deformed on purpose so that nothing gets in front of the camera, this causes the rig to look janky and shadows are casted the way they are. To change the shadow they either have to use a "proxy" entity and assign that to the player, or change the entire player anim rig.
I swear I don't understand how people even notice or care about half of these things. How often do you swim in this game that you notice the shadow underwater? Who gives a shit if the NPCs don't walk around your parked car? Why do you spend time punching people on the street?

Half these things being called "little details" are more like "things you have to go out of your way to even see".
This game was farrrr better than pathetic Starfield.
You all piss and moan about the price of games, yet you want game physics for pretty much everything you can think of.
... Boring comparison, with so many changes he chooses those features?
I'm tired of the shitty development trend of releasing a broken product and spending the next 3 years patching it to a state it should have been at on release. Nothing about any of this is impressive and it should not be praised.
    Thats because OP literally showed things relating to older patches. Only about 2 things out of a massive laundry list rwlating to changes in 2.0 was showcased here

Ur being fed a narrative instead of actually checking it out urself
Proof that the game was rushed.

Too bad we still don't have car customization. It would be a nice addition.
    I mean... if 9 years of development doesn't do it...

I'm not sure we need another star citizen...

Even if the game is still kind of rushed, at some point you have to pay the people working on it... So it needed to come out, and since they extended the "need to polish" excuse for the 6month release delay... They couldn't hide behind a beta, especially for a narrative game whose main story is so short.

Maybe they bit more than they could chew... and they needed to rip the band-aid...
        It was in development for 4/5 years, after blood and wine. Unless you count concept.
Don't swim. I mean who would want to swim in these waters anyway? Are you suicidal?
still very buggy and glitchy. i wish the devs had focused more on the glitches/bugs and behaviours in 2.0.
    Nine of these things in the video impact ur game experience with the campaign unless ur spending a huge chunk of ur time blocking traffic. Swimming or doing weird shit in cars thats not part of normal gameplay. 

Nobody has yet called out any bugs or issues with the fundamental core of the game which is the campaign and RPG element

Everything is whinging about gta esque immersion for which this is not
The car stopping when you jumped out actually made sense. Current cars can recognize when someone is in the seat for the seat belt indicator. It's not too far off that in the future cars could realize the driver has left the seat and engage the brake. I work on commercial vans and some even go into park automatically if you are rolling under a certain speed or if the door is even opened. That honestly just seems like a future safety feature cars will have one day.
Is cyberpunk like gta?
    No. It's more like the modern deus ex games, or even 3D Fallout
    No, and it isn't trying to be.
oh great now I have to wait for 2.1 to finally start playing
This post really covers all the systems people complain about but which I dont care about at all. basically, the GTA open-world sandbox shit. I play the game for the story, characters, atmosphere, quests, gameplay, RPG systems. I couldn't care less about engaging with the random NPCs and police. Which is probably why I loved the game even on release.

(Great post though)
I get these updates are cool but all these features should have been in the game when it was originally released.
    What do you want them to do, turn back time and redo launch day? There's nothing they can do but try to fix the shit that they have done and that's what they're doing now.
        I wanted the game to be fixed when I pre-ordered it. Some of these features are basic features that have been in 20+ year old games.
            Okay.

What is your comment going to achieve though. It is a blank, pointless statement.
                Same as you, no?
                People need to leave this poor little studio alone. They’ve been working for YEARS to make a game that works like a AAA game should. It’s crazy how not picky people are being. They need to get past it and leave it be
                Your comments are in the same level slugger
                Not a blank statement. The meaning behind it is that cp owners collected money and the game is still broken 3 years after release which is ridiculous
So many entitled cunts in here lol.
    Cope loser
        Cope with what? Why are you even here?
This is definitively a step in the right direction, and I'm glad they came through to some degree.

The game is much better than it was on release. This will be my 3rd complete playthrough of it.

&#x200B;

And yet, it is still not what was sold to me in 2013 and I see no reason to pay extra for Phantom Liberty.

&#x200B;

Sorry, not good enough.
It's better to compare 1.6 to 2.0, as that's what they are comparing too. Also there is no way to go non-lethal and it's just awful. I hate 2.0
meh
Tbh, I'm quite disappointed with the game that it's not as bad as the hater says, but the game is also not as good or even finished like the fan said. I'm not sure what to expect in the future, but its kinda ok, I guess. I'm not expecting AAA level, but I just hope some basic stuff like fall or jump animation exists, you know?
they finally reached 50% of gta v
I played through 95% of  Witcher 3 on PS4 with that pack which had all DLCs. I don't remember any particular bugs. 

 I test drove 30mins of cyberpunk earlier this year on pc and it was fine. 


Are we nippicking or are they bugs and big gameplay faults all over cyberpunk?
game still looks like shit lmfao cant even hold a candle to starfield, let alone Rockstar open world games.
    starfield? you mean the game where NPC dont care if you aim at them or shoot around?
So, did they need 3 more years to finish the game I take it then?
This shit is embarrassing...
Maybe after a few more years they'll add splashes to the water lol

I am glad the police interactions and vehicle damage got fixed for the most part but I'm surprised at some of the basic things that all games have that still don't work well here.
I guess the goal is to release the full game before 2077.
3 (three) years since release. How it is even possible to make it so bad.
Fantastic work. Just proves though it was realised at least 2 years too early to satisfy investors.
I finished this at release but looking at this I'm thinking another playthrough may be coming.
After preordering I'm not giving CDPR another penny. An incomplete game missing promised features. A throne of lies!
Get woke Go broke 😪
See you guys in 2077 when cyberpunk 2077 is finally done
The fixes are so minor and underwhelming they should have released this update long ago
Wow, this game is not in the alpha version after 3 years, now we wait for another 3 years to not be in the beta version.
glad to see the game is finally catching up to gta 4
I love that the game is finally in a release ready state 3 years after I paid for it,
One more gripe is that you cannot see your gloves in first person.
    I think it's probably because that little wire you always use is in your wrist, so they hide the gloves in the actual gameplay view. Your jacket sleeves also get rolled up in first person too, also for the sake of cyberware I imagine. Mantis Blades don't really make sense if they've gotta go through your jacket sleeve lol
        Wouldn't it be crazy if they made the gloves have a little hole for the little wire
            Would raise the poly count on the models, probably tank performance!
                I mean, it'd just be a texture remodel. From what I understand you wouldn't need to change the gloves model, just add a transparent texture where the hole is. Heck, depending on how small of a hole we're talking it wouldn't need transparency.
                Wouldnt be much of an issue considering how various clothes have different poly counts anyways. Plus, it wouldnt be very many polys anyways.
                I legit cannot tell if thats sarcasm or not.
                    Yes it was supposed to be..!
                        Oooh damn sorry then lmao.

And yeah, a sleek and good one... ppl do be saying stupid shit like that with straight face, seen it multiple times on this sub alone.
            gloves with holes?? nonsense. makes more sense to wear gloves which dissapear in First person view
            My characters are still bald when they drive a vehicle.
    I wish that arm mods didn't get rid of your nail art.
My Cosmetic Gripe is that my tiny 🫣🫣 *enbiggen* when you put tops on because the clothes don't deform to the body.

Which is probably related to the reason we have one body model, and the clothes don't matter for the masc body, but you have 3 chest sizes and they all look the same in the clothes.
    All night city clothing has a LOT of padding in them, due to all the 80s future punk influences.
        [removed]
            More like 28C
        I had to headcannon that it was armored because muh immersion. But now the gear doesn't have armor ;_; my poor flapjacks.

All bodies are <fine3 but they can be smaller sometimes, particularly outside of the nubile/bait anime waifus. Grown adults also come in many sizes, and the mid-size V's are just on the larger side [*relative to her frame*]. And they are further enhanced by the way clothing bulks up.

Though the larger V's also have my condolences because they get a pretty bad compression effect on the other side of the scale :p
        This guy lores
    The existence of clothing with some sort of advanced built-in fake boob technology seems perfectly reasonable in the CP2077 world.  Unfortunately only the elites can afford the clothing that allows for customization, while us plebeians are stuck with one [cup] size fits all.
    That's irritating.
        It is. It's such a small immersion breaker. I understand if they didn't have to time or budget to make deformables, or make 3 models of every top... but then just remove the bust size option.
            They couldn't let guys have dick size without letting the ladies make their boobs bigger, and dick size adjustability was a core design pillar of the game, immutable.
                Jokes aside I was really kind of expecting, not for the sake of obscenity, that if they had cut/uncut, that they would have the bravery to add innies/outies [to put it politely]. I know the snippy isn't a "natural" occurrence, while the other is, but I am all about some body positivity and they shoulda given the femme body the same attention [clothing/modeling].
    agree if you have a huge bust size, your melons suddenly shrink....thank good modders will fix that again, after the liberty dlc came out so they dont have to do patch work twice
Also if you have curly hair it magically becomes straight.
Also it changes your hair color. No hat my V has blonde hair with pale orange tips. Put a hat on and all of their hair turns BRIGHT orange. Super annoying.
At least it doesn't change your hair type or make you bald like other games.
Inconsistent quantities of hair? 

Literally unplayable.
That seems to be fixed on mine. I put on the baseball cap and my character still has short hair.
    I think it's one of those things where no matter what hair style you have it will look this one way when wearing a hat. So I think there are a handful of hairstyles where it will look normal, and many ways where it won't.

The easiest way to tell would be to switch your hair to bald and try it out.
GTA 4 was ahead of its time
    The fact that you could get thrown out of the car through the windshield was dope.  I rememeber GTA5 having so much worse physics, it was a huge step backwards, but the more busy looking world sort of hid the lack of complex physics.
        To be fair, the cars in IV were too wobbly, V they were too sturdy but it wasn't as bad as IV's wobbliness.
            I don't think they were too wobbly
    Still the best crime sandbox game to date. Super underrated
        You think GTA IV is underrated?
            He spelled sleeping dog wrong clearly
Man that's still pissing me off lol. I'd like to be able to miss my turn on a bike into a pylon without it becoming a near death experience lmao.
    have you seen what happens to reckless bikers irl?

I honestly wish I never did.
        i wish they would make it so if you die in cyberpunk you die in real life
            okay 👍
        r/meatcrayon
            Why in God's name did I click this link...
    There is a perk called Stuntjock that lets you either jump out or slide out of your vehicle.  I haven't tried it on a bike, though, but I'm sure it works
        I'll have to get it; old habits die hard and I fear I'll never learn to respect the vehicles after years of a certain play style lol. I started fresh since I didn't really want to sit and reallocate so many skill points. Just made sense to take the time to learn them over levelling rather than in one go, for me at least.
    Well, that would kill you irl, so a near death experience is getting off easy.
thank you for link to original source 🫂
thanks, this is what i came for. 

i didn't want to watch a horribly compressed reddit upload of a youtube video. link the youtube video, holy shit people want internet points so bad.
    People get internet points either way though lol, just stupidity
And look at this they didn’t even acknowledge your comment to even say oh shit sorry thanks
If they released [real modding tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO44e1rs9Ls&t=1s), modders could improve the game.
    The Bethesda approach.
        At least Bethesda doesn't leave console owners hanging. CDPR is very PC-centric so modding for their games only cover (less than) half the fanbase.
            Over half of CP2077 sales were on PC. It was 56% PC, 28% Playstation, and 17% Xbox. Obviously the numbers may have changed since then, but yeah.
        At least Bethesda actually made Starfield feel like a fucking game compared to this broken piece of shit at launch.
            Well, Cyberpunk certainly has its own feel these days. It always had, and now very much so, had its own vibe. Now it's just 10x better.
            Cope, Starfield is the same shit as Cyberpunk but its a Bethesda game.
                I take it you played Starfield then? And Cyberpunk at launch? 

Cyberpunk crashed multiple times for me in a 2 hour span, had multiple physics bugs and the very first chase mission broke for me to the point where I had to restart the game for it to work. The game was a clusterfuck, had multiple mechanics that were half assed and overhyped. And I don’t just mean the way the game played, I mean what they actually implemented was executed in a broken state. Combat, police spawning, vehicle mechanics. 

You can criticize Starfield for it’s mechanics. That’s all personal preference. But you seriously can not sit here and say the game was broken on launch. Or that it isn’t at least cohesive. I played the early access and had a couple physics bugs in my 15 hours of playing, but nothing game breaking. Mainly just funny stuff like asteroids or random ships spinning. It was nowhere NEAR the level of mess as Cyberpunk or even Skyrim at launch. You people just find reasons to shit on Bethesda because it’s Bethesda.
        [deleted]
            I played Skyrim at launch on the 360 and hard agree. While the main quest went mostly smoothly, the rest of the sidequests were bugged to hell. I remember following [this guide](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Glitches) because some quest rewards were straight up unobtainable because of quest-related bugs.
            I remember coming back to Skyrim years after release and they never fixed things like getting shouted through walls and stuck there, and a damned main quest breaking bug that blocked all progress and you had to start again. And then they just left it. It was appalling, and presumably those bugs are STILL there!!
                [deleted]
                    Set aside all of the bad glitches and poor launch, Skyrim is highly anticipated because of its legacy.

The Elder Scrolls Franchise is one of the longest and  pretty well known franchise within the gaming world.


Skyrim really captivated all of its audience because of the seemingly vast world and the immersion of the game also makes it such a memorable game to many others.

I, for one, invested 2 days of just playing Skyrim because the world is interesting and unique. The NPCs have their own routine and not just static A.I who only acts when the player is nearby.

They react to your actions and will confront you.


I mean I can put a bucket on to a trader and steal all of his shit without getting caught. For a 2011 game, that was groundbreaking. Can't do that shit in CP77.

Skyrim is also one of the quotable games as you can say anything an NPC said other gamers would most likely recognise it.
            I got skyrim on release. Got about 70hrs in and somehow over the course of 2, possibly 3 updates, something caused my save file(s) to totally bork. Like just randomly while playing a bunch of textures wouldn't load properly and objects in the environment would just be a flat purple placeholder one and would eventually CTD. 



Then even if you didn't have that going on, it would 100% CTD when trying to enter very specific interior cells. Even if you COC'd in the console there it would crash. One of those was an area required to progress the main story, and even if you tried to just do other random stuff it was getting more and frequent. I was staggering saves but by the time I fully realized how bad of a problem it was I would have had to go way to far back just to test if that would fix it. I had to restart entirely and then didn't have any issues like that since. I remember looking it up back than and wasn't the only one with those same 2 issues.


Nothing like the broken save think, but FO3 and NV, Oblivion, and Morrowind were all "crash at least once every hour or two" experiences even years after release without outside mods. 


CP2077 I played 2 back to back playthroughs of about 100hrs each and I think it CTDed maybe 3 times. Other than quirky glitchy NPC  animations and the like I had no other issues.
                God I wish I had your luck. I ended up crafting and disassembling so much that I hit that weird glitch that completely and irreversibly bricked your save (was patched later, but the save is irreversibly bricked)
            "I was there Gandalf. I was there 3,000 years ago.  I was there the day the strength of Men failed."
            Skyrim on 1st gen ps3's, there was a point where you couldn't go under water without your game crashing instantly. I couldn't play because my most recent saves were me in a cave where the only exit was to swim.  I specifically had to write an email to Bethesda detailing the problem, because they wouldn't patch it.  Cool thing was someone on their team responded to me and their patch a week or two later fixed it.
            Lmao no. 

I played Skyrim on the 360 launch day, and I got to beat the story.

Cyberpunk is not even playable period on PS4 and Xbox One

Stop wearing them rose tinted glasses
            I had the game launch day on 360 and I have zero clue what you're talking about dude.  The only game breaking bug at launch was a PS3 file size issue that caused the save to keep growing until it broke the game.  It was only on the PS3 and was officially patched shortly after.  There were zero mods for us console players back then and it worked fine.  

Taking into account the last Gen versions of 2077, this launch was so much worse.  Anyone that thinks otherwise either didn't play either game at launch, are cherry picking versions they're referring back to, or are completely delusional (yes I know this is the cyberpunk sub so that's a distinct possibility).

As to the updates, you have to remember they *couldn't*, or at least chose not to, patch the game so significantly it broke games on past consoles.  Cyberpunk went the other route (Xbox one and PS4 did not get the 2.0 update because it changed the recommended specs of the game).  There was also the issue of internet bandwidth back then.  Patches weren't nearly as massive as they are now, yet still took forever to download.

Edit - lmao dude gave the most snarky fanboy response and blocked me so I couldn't even reply.  😂  In response to his dumb ass reply though, I also had no issues on Xbox series X aside from blatant missing features meant to be added, but I can objectively view this game as a failed launch overall...
            I don’t know about that. While I was only a teenager when Skyrim came out, I remember it being a really fun experience at launch. I couldn’t even enjoy Cyberpunk at launch, it was seriously rough.
                Skyrim was much more broken than Cyberpunk. PS3 version literally stopped working when your save file got to a certain size. Was literally a myriad of game breaking bugs. Bricked consoles, bricked entire save datas.

It's hilarious anyone thinks cyberpunk was that broken at all, it's not even in my top 10 top game broken releases. Could and should have been better but it ran and didn't brick things, and you could get lucky and have a full play through with no bugs.

Gamers opinions are much stricter on what's acceptable now, but they also forget quickly

It's funny how you Google something like broken game launches and nowhere mentions the fact Battlefield 4 literally wasn't playable for 6 months. That's how you do a broken release, and that wasn't even that long ago!

Sim city, spore, mcc, assassins creed unity, Arkham Knight. Battlefront 2, wwe 2k20. Some truly shitty releases.
                    Agreed. imo, the Cyberpunk bugs were never the main issue with this game. Most of its huge problems came from how misleading the marketing was and the insane amount of hype. They sold us on some mythical dream game.  


Compared to good ol' Arkham Knight that literally was unplayable for me on release, Ac Unity with the part of the map my character couldn't walk through... or hell even the recent Jedi Survivor with the choppiest stuttery mess of a game ever.
                        Yeah, I can only presume people think cyberpunk was more broken simply because more players played it. For an older head like me I can't get my head around it, it was never that broken
                    So the PS3 version was broke, not Skyrim in general.

On PC it was fine at launch.

Much like CP2077, ironically. The console versions had the most issues.

The worst issues with CP2077 at launch were fundamental design and resources.
            A decade and a couple of remasters later, I still didn't get past a game breaking bug. If I recall correctly, the game constantly crashed when trying to take a boat to a location. (Whiterun?)

The only bug I remember from the launch version of CP2077 is still in the 2.0 version. It's Jackie walking straight though a locker in the Sandra Dorsett mission.
            I have played skyrim 1.0 extensively it wasn't that bad
            I’ve played hundreds of hours of Skyrim on pc without ever touching a mod, you’re totally full of shit if you claim that even a majority of people couldn’t beat the game because it was broken
                There were so many bugs like being launched into space and the dragons flying backwards and Pastinak or whatever never landing
                He's not saying it's broken right now but speaking on the initial state. Of course you can beat the game now since the game is 10 years old.
                    I bought it launch day on Xbox 360, I remember no issues that were game breaking.  Game crashing occasionally, yes, which were patched out fairly quickly.

The "game breaking bugs" the person was referring to only existed on PS3.  In that respect, 2077 was way worse including the last Gen versions.
                        I recall a bug on PC that crashed the game every single time it autosaved. It was bad
                        I played on ps3 and never had bugs that stopped my progress or bricked my save.
                        https://venturebeat.com/games/technically-disastrous-skyrim-is-bethesdas-most-solid-release-yet/

You realize a bunch of people played 2077 on pc with no issues right, just like people did on Skyrim. PS3 users were the worst effected but they were there for each console 

Just because you were one of the people that didn't have issues doesn't mean that was the reality for everyone. Having a whole current gen console not being able to play a game is pretty bad 

https://www.neogaf.com/threads/skyrim-vs-cyberpunk-2077-which-game-was-more-buggy-at-release-vote-inside.1581929/

Skyrim is notoriously at the top of worst releases ever, I attached another link comparing 2077 to Skyrim and people voted Skyrim being worse and this was in 2020 at the peak of the glitches in cyberpunk

I'll acknowledge that there's a chance that your single experience could be more telling then the masses who experienced both launches. There's a chance they're all misremembering it since it was 10 years ago
                            So every link you posted, in both article and comments specifically mention the PS3 bug I mentioned.  That was that.  Was there a long list of bugs in general?  Yeah, have you seen the length of patches of Baldur's Gate 3?  Patch 1 fixed over 1000 bugs and is probably going to be GOTY.

Cyberpunk had baaaad bugs on multiple systems, and obviously removed intended features at release, across the board, which we're now getting a glimpse of.  It's generally regarded as one of the worst launches ever for a game.

I could keep pulling links but I've got dinner to tend to.
                                Both are regarded as terrible launches, I acknowledged that ps3 was the main culprit so you'd actually engage with what I said but you don't seem to want to do that 

One of the links I mentioned had people talking about issues on Xbox and pc, just because ps3 was the worst doesn't mean there weren't major issues elsewhere. I'm not sure I see your point
                [deleted]
            Skyrim UI is still unplayable, even WITH SkyUI.
            Skyrim bricked my PS3, so yeah.

Edit: PS3 got autocorrected to PS4. Hate that shit.
            Uh, I definitely beat the main quest multiple times without any mods. I didn't play it all the way back at launch though
                [deleted]
                    Hell, I couldn't make it to the chopping block in the intro due to the physics engine bugging out at more than 60fps. The carriages just flipped into the sky
                        Fallout 4 had an issue at launch on PC where if you were playing at above 100 FPS you could lock the game trying to exit a terminal. I had to replay so much of the game each time it hardlocked and had to start quick-saving before accessing any terminal in case it happened until I found the issue.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3s4y20/psa\_getting\_stuck\_at\_terminals\_here\_is\_a\_fix/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3s4y20/psa_getting_stuck_at_terminals_here_is_a_fix/) 

It had a workaround, but it was pretty dumb issue to have. My monitor has a button to change refresh rate and so I enabled vsync and when entering a terminal I'd set it to 60hz, then readjust it back to 144hz when I'd left the terminal.
                    Yep same for me on pc, literally couldn't progress
                    I never had that bug but you were on PC, you could have also just phased through the door with TCL.
            >the main quest was literally unbeatable because it was so bugged.

So, you think people on consoles just... couldn't play the game at launch? And people just ignored that?

C'mon, lol

Makes me feel old that it's been so long since Skyrim launched that people will just say whatever about it.
            Yeah, Cyberpunk was *bad* but I lost 2 entire saves to bugs in skyrim.
    I really wish they would do this, if they are done with the game at least let the public do what they want with it and make it the game it always should have been,
        They're also done with the engine it seems, so they don't really need to be overprotective.
            Hopefully they move to Unreal Engine 5. Should hopefully help them make more stable games.
                Yup, they announced a bit ago they are moving exclusively to UE5. I hear it’s really good so I’m glad they made that decision. Let Unreal work on the engine while they focus on making a good game.
                    So Witcher 1 remake will be on UE5? Hot damn.
                    Thanks for letting me know. Great news. CDPR being massive means Epic will likely go the extra mile, too, to help brand recognition.
                That is exactly what they are doing. The Witcher 4 is using it, and is being developed right now
    I mean, they have RedMod

https://www.gog.com/game/cyberpunk_2077_redmod
        If you think Redmod is user friendly for New - Mid/Experienced modders you're out of your damn mind. I've made mods for Bethesda games for 20 years. I've spent quite sometime looking at my options for making gameplay / immersion related mods for Cyberpunk 2077 and come to the conclusion that it's just not worth the amount of effort it'd take.

It is pain stakingly obvious if you even take a glimpse at NexusMods for Cyberpunk 2077 that the amount of Gameplay / Immersion / New Quests / New Weapons / New Location / Animation / Bug Fixes mods are absolutely miniscule compared to just Cosmetic clothing and photo mode mods. Add that to a pie chart and compare it to any bethesda release with a CK / XEdit attached to it.

We need something in the form of XEdit and even 1/4th of what Creation Kit offers for 2077 but I just don't think that's going to happen. I don't think CDPR cares THAT much about the mod scene to pull enough budget to make that happen for longevity. There are many engine and design choices that most likely also hold this back from being a possibility as well. It's great for a first step but since CDPR had prior experience with mod tools I was hoping that eventually we'd have modding tools that were way more **user friendly** by now.
            >We need something in the form of XEdit and even 1/4th of what Creation Kit offers for 2077 but I just don't think that's going to happen. I

Yep.  I'm an utter numpty and I was able to make FO4 mods with CK and xedit after watching a few short videos.  They are very approachable and powerful tools.
        That's not enough. We need RedKit, [which was released in the past for TW2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVcMiSIopsw).
        Map editor would rock. We should fill all the buildings with stuff.
            Some modders are already trying to do that. Like the Megabuilding projects mods.
            AMM on Nexus disguises itself as a simple photo-mode enhancer but actually lets you spawn [i believe permanent] objects into the game world, as well as NPCs you can path-animate.
                Not quite what i'm after. I'd like new interior spaces in buildings that currently don't even have functional doors or windows and later on those spaces could be filled with people, companies, quests etc.
        Redmod is a rebrand of wolvenkit which is the community made modding tools for TW3 and 2077. So yep, it’s quite bad as CDPR hired modders instead of doing what they did with TW2 and promised for TW3 (but never delivered), redkit.
            It's still more than we get for almost any AAA game. But I also don't care enough to like argue about it; mods currently do what I need them to do.
                Still, we don’t really get anything more than other AAA games modding. Redmod is just shit for an official modding tool.
    They probably shouldnt do this lest they send a message to their executive board who thinks its a smart idea to finish half baked games to just be fixed with mods like Bethesda is doing it seems.
    No, let them fix their own bugs and imperfections
        Why not both? (also there aren't going to be any more major patches, so they won't)
            We don't need another Bethesda
                Actually, I think we could use more devs who are as open to modding as Bethesda. Modders can do thinks professional devs don't really have space to, from niche pet projects to potentially controversial options that many would be asking for a toggle to turn off. 

Bethesda modding is not just bug fixes, and many (of my favourite) mods are things Bethesda would've never implemented. 

Having a game with focused vision as a baseline that devs provide full toolkit for so players can add or remove features as it fits them could make for a perfect game.

People say that not every game has to be for everyone... but with wide embrace of modding, they could be.
    Ah yes perfect solution to start releasing 3/4 of a game.
I really hope they make a sequel that still takes place in Night City. That way less time and effort is wasted on creating a new game world and they can just work on improving the solid foundation they've built. There's so much they can do with the current city we have that would still feel fresh such as the countless interiors they can expand on and let us explore.

That would free them up to giving us a bunch of cyberware that physically changes our appearance, improving combat (especially melee), designing new weapons, and improving the NPC and enemy AI. But most of all I'd like for them to give us a 3rd person option with good animations for combat and traversal.
    Me too one of the biggests dissapointments i had from the game is that they promised a more vertical oriented game, that while the map wasnt more bigger than the Witcher 3 everything was going to be more vertical visiting interiors like Judge dredd megacity blocks, highlines and buildings to explore with content on them, instead except for some scripted events everything is locked at ground level or a third outmost, hope if there is a second game they focus on that.
        Sounds like Dogtown is supposed to be exactly what you're describing. So we should get a pretty good idea of what CDPR is capable of for their next Cyberpunk title.
        Yeah the main issues with the game won’t be solved by fixing bugs
    In my opinion, the game has good amount of weapons and it seems to me that no game has good NPC AI (I have never seen someone saying a game has good enemy AI, it's always mentioned to state that it is bad). Before cyberware physically alters the character, I think it should alter gameplay first including the UI (Nier Automata approach).  
I hope Nivalis comes out good and a sequel to Cyberpunk takes inspiration from that. Night City was and still is dead inside with only a select activities to do. I can't believe they changed the game so much and still I am stuffing bottles of alcohol into my pockets for some reason. I can't believe that whenever I go to a bar or a restaurant, there is a dubbed character behind the stall that opens menu and that's all.
        The Halo games under Bungie definitely received well deserved praise for their enemy AI, as did TLoU 2 and P1 Remake. Halo CE was revolutionary in that regard and still receives high praise to this day for what it accomplished. There are plenty of other examples I can't be bothered to list right now. As for NPCs, any improvements would be welcome, they still pale in comparison to GTA V NPCs for example, and that's a game from 2013.

I agree that cyberware should improve in more ways than just altering physical appearances, that's just what I'm more focused on I guess. Seeing the way every character in the series other than V gets chromed out due to their implants was always a letdown.
        > (I have never seen someone saying a game has good enemy AI, it's always mentioned to state that it is bad

Have you played Halo? Those games are practically the gold standard for enemy AI. They are smart and tactical, care about their own lives (unless it’s an enemy that explicitly shouldn’t, like aliens going berserk or trying to suicide bomb you), work in groups, maintain pressure on the player, etc. Really highly recommend the Bungie games.

FEAR is famous for having very intelligent, tactical enemy AI. It’s on par with Halo, in my opinion. 

Hitman and Metal Gear Solid V are also really good ones.
            >FEAR is famous for having very intelligent, tactical enemy AI. It’s on par with Halo, in my opinion. 

FEAR did an excellent job of making it seem like they were far smarter than they were as well. Their call-outs being so specific to what you were doing and their ability to spot your flashlight made them feel like a real threat. 

Overall terrific game and it's a shame the sequels never could reach the same height.
            FEAR also had the benefit of tuning the AI specifically to interact the level design. This combination made them seem way more intelligent than they were.

Halo is an interesting one because Bungie originally was making Halo as an RTS when they switched to a shooter. So the enemy AI is using RTS in combination with really reactive behaviors specific to their species and rank.
            I never played Halo but I remember FEAR having good AI. I never thought Hitman and MGSV AI as good though. Bad AI thing seems coming up more and more nowadays. I kind of don't understand it because even on Youtube there are people developing AI models to play games efficiently. In the age they should have advanded AI instead of basic min-max strategies, we seem to see more and more games with bad AI though. (I assume the Halo with good AI is also old too, like I said never played)
            All good callouts. I remember the AI in Red Faction: Guerilla being pretty damn good too. Maybe not on par with Halo or FEAR, but considering they had to deal with almost everything in the world being destructible, it was pretty impressive. I never saw them bug out and they would make interesting tactical choices that made them pretty difficult.
            I've heard as well that STALKER accidentally made really effective enemy AI just by programming it to find cover and flank or something.
        STALKER has great NPC AI. It's also ukrainian slav magic 9000 on X-Ray engine, made in the 2000s. But they live on their own, follow missions, fight other NPCs dynamically, pick up items that actually appear into their inventory, etc...

I completely agree on the lack on interactibility of the game. You just have the core gameplay loop of combat encounters, sometimes with story elements. But nothing else. The game world doesn't react to what you do either. It feels lifeless.

I really liked Yakuza on that aspect. You go karaoke, play golf, fish, drink at bars, everything has cutscenes or minigames, everything has a substory (usually funny or with a moral behind it). Every street has different, recognisable shops and light signs, or greeter NPCs.

It would be a time drain to do it as well on the huge map of Night City. And I honestly believe it's size is part of the game's problems. They should have made it smaller, more dense and packed.
            After playing 2.0 couple of hours, I was just looking for Yakuza games to play before reading your comment.
They still patch the Witcher every now and then
    Oh for sure. I'm just wondering how much work some of these fixes will require. CP2077 has been a weird project for them.
>The underwater shadow is something else, though. That's crazy looking.

He's just doing underwater Jutsu, leave my boy Vruto outta this.
The video is misleading. If you block only a part of the sidewalk NPC will now manouever their way to the destination.

The guy in the video just blocked the whole sidewalk and in that situation NPC will turn back.
    I wouldn't call that misleading. I'd call that weird AI still. I'd expect them to stop and yell at me for blocking their path.
I would expect that to ride on how well Phantom of Liberty does.

The NPCs detect the blocked path, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to add a walk around, jump over, flee, or even aggro, depending on the NPC type or affiliation.

I still would love a proper 3rd person mode when not in combat. Every time I ride a bike I get reminded it would be so cool to have.
I don’t mind some of the funnier bugs staying in. Yesterday I ran someone over and they were stuck standing up inside my engine.
If this dlc is the last one for this game, I think the updates will end here, because for two years it is done so little that the developers and 5 years will not be enough to fix everything they promised (subway, garage, car upgrades and much more...)

Definitely agree on the hair point. Just unlocking the styles would do wonders for character creation. I'm so fucking tired of male V having long hair only to hide his Vegeta hairline
Well they did add hair! Theres like 20 new ones or something, largely thr afro hairs.
You can press 4 to bring out the mantis blades, but being able to scroll to them feels more natural
Auto driving on cars! Why don't they have this? Self driving cars are canon in the game.
Yeah it sucks being kitted with preem cyberware, but always have to manually open the menu each time just to use it on console.

    100% Why bother with an in-depth character creator and tons of clothing choices when we never see our character except in photo mode or in mirrors. I don't buy the "it's fur da immershen!" excuse either. I think it was one more thing sacrificed to get the game shipped on the timetable they wanted.   


I know some people love first person but just make it switchable like Bethesda does in their games.
        No.

There are times where >!you see yourself to show you're not you anymore!< or >!silver hand in the mirror!< which would have such little impact if it was third person as you can see >!who you are physically.!<
            Small trade off to actually be able to see the character I spent so long designing in the CC and the clothes she is wearing. Also, this is a personal thing but I think melee combat in games works a lot better in 3rd person view. It's hard for it not to look silly in first person.
                > Small trade off 

no wonder stories are becoming milque when something that huge to the story is "a small trade off"
I agree but unfortunately they decided to cater to the GTA crouch and focus on vehicle combat/police chases
Same haha, had never noticed it was this bad before, and that it's worse now is hilarious
>For some reasons NPC's die instantly when punched.

Me: OOOONNNNEEEEE PUUUUUUUUUUUUNCH!
Maybe OP had arm mods or something? Not sure. Also did that homeless person parry you? lol
    Yeah I noticed this wasn’t the same experience as my own. NPC’s reacted to my grenades and punching them was just like your link.
        OP also used a different grenade than the one they used in the "BEFORE" vid
            That was anti-personnel grenade used in the OP video and I think that's the difference.
            Your point? They should still get out the car and run at the sight of imminent danger.
                My point being that one boom boom grenade can be different that spec ops hight grade grenade of imminent nearby destruction of dealing damage out of nowhere.

Also different NPCs have different reactions to stuff like that.
                    Nah bro, it shouldn't matter what kind of grenade it is, the fact to the matter is that is a grenade, something that's dangerous, something they should be programmed to run away from or at least be frightened by despite what type of damage it does.

Don't go this far just to excuse what's obviously an oversight from the devs.
They did say while sprinting tho
wth was that delay after the punch, people were processing the impact still lmfaoooooo
    well the delay was only on 1 NPC
        i saw on the stairs one, the second one had a little, and the third one took like a week to realize she was punched in the head
He probably simply deals too much damage with his fists
    That person’s V is just Saitama
They just don't get one-shot anymore (unless you are very overpowered). That was in the change notes. All NPCs are now at your character level instead of lvl 1. I'm only lvl 8 right now and it takes like 6 punches to kill an NPC or 3 head shots with a tier 1 pistol. 

Also seems they applied it to inanimate objects, too, since now I have to pump 9 assault rifle shots into a speaker to get it to die, when one used to do the trick.
    Well... that's interesting. Thanks for the info lol
To be honest, out of a 100 hour playthrough, how much time are you really going to spend looking at your shadow while swimming under water?
    exactly, so why doesn't CDPR just turn it off
        Maybe it's not as simple as just flipping an off switch?
    You can't just keep saying stuff like this for every detail though, at some point you got an unpolished game in your hands and you have to admit it.
        I read an intersting article talking about game developement and the problem how as games get more and more realistic the gamers come to expect even more and how the smallest issues can badly affect the games immersion the more relasitic they become. But at the same time they cant possibly make everything perfect on games that are so large with budget and time restraint considerations.

The underwater elements are a tiny percentage of the overall gameplay. At the end of the day remember its just a game lol.
        You are correct....for things that players sees the most I agree. However underwater swimming shadows...not so much.

Sorry your experience is unpolished but I'm having a blast!
Ya GTA 5 and RDR 2 really spoil the player with the little details that you don't even really notice until you play a game that doesn't have them
    GTA5 I'd much, much less detailed than its predecessor, sadly. So many good things from gta4 was cut
    One thing I would like to add to RDR2 and it's physics: it's the first game I ever played where I felt that objects have mass. Like when you hotige someone and put their body on the horse, or when you are in a fistfight or a gunfight. You can feel that the things happening in the world have weight and force like in real life.

I mean a few people here mentioned GTA 4 and how it was ahead of its time. Yes, sure its ragdoll physics is even superior to GTA 5 where the later is much more arcadish, moreover, compared to RDR2, in GTA 4 the objects doesn't feel like they have mass.
If you get the chance, give Saints Row 2 a whirl if you like that sort of stuff. It's a bit dated by today's standards, but there's always something new to find in the city. There's loads of interiors and the NPCs are always doing stuff, either interacting with the world or getting up to stupid shit. It's also got some of the most advanced customization you've ever seen in a video game, even by today's standards. There are also tiny details, for example, if you hear a radio ad that a store is having a sale, and then go to the store, they are in fact having a sale.

The best way to play it currently is on xbox, either og 360 or with back-compat, but xenia does a pretty good job on PC with only a few minor hiccups graphically. Once you get it set up and the correct options set, that is. The PC port is a trainwreck worse than launch Cyberpunk in terms of bugs/stability, but there are mods to mitigate the worst of the issues. There was supposed to be a patch, but with Volition closing down who knows if that will still happen.
    Played SR2 in 2020 for the first time and it def holds up well. Its old now, but its a game that was made to be *a game* so it rides a good line between whats realistic to see, and whats fun to play. As a huge fan of the open world crime game genre it was one of the last that I played and it still shot up to my top 5 past tons that came after it.

Their NPCs are some of the best because they have so much variety in what they do and who they are. Old people using walkers, couples doing PDA, pimps actually pimping, college students protesting, etc. And then you go spray shit on a govt building, get hit by a car and fly 200ft and toss people into trash trucks for fun. And the story is still some top tier drama.

I thought SR2 stans were overhyping it for so long but SR2 still stands alone in its genre. One of the only things thats lived up to the hype for me.
        There's just so much weirdly obsessive attention to detail in the world. Something a lot of games don't spend a ton of time on (even the later Saints Row entries) because the assumption is that players don't notice it. And while a player may not explicitly sit there and go "wow look at that old person towing around their oxygen cart" or "wow look at all of the mall goths in the mall" it all adds up to an underlying feeling that the world is real. Which is why despite the dated, stiff animations and graphics, SR2's Stilwater is still one of the best open world cities ever.

I think the key takeaway from SR2 is that the NPCs, even random peds, are *agents* in the world, not just scenery. They may visit a store to do some shopping. They may interrupt your shopping trip by holding the cashier at gunpoint. In shitty parts of town the cashier might fight back. They'll lean up against a wall and have a smoke, start playing a drum kit outside. They'll go to play pool or piano. Hell, they'll even drive drunk. Two peds might intrude on each other's personal space and start fighting. The cops may escalate a situation with a random pedestrian until a full-on riot has started. Gangs get in wars with each other and the cops. You might have an NPC run into the garage and flash you while you're working on your car.

Cyberpunk has added a lot of stuff to this tune between 1.5 and 2.0, and it's certainly welcome, but a lot of it is still powered by scripted events. A few chosen NPCs are spawned to do the thing, and all of the rest of them are glorified scenery with no individual agency. In SR2, the NPCs dynamically interact with each other and with scripted event triggers around the world. Hell, if you leave the game AFK, eventually your player character will start acting as an NPC and seek out the nearest scripted activity until you come back. More than once I came back from a piss break to my player leaning against a wall smoking a cig or playing bouncer outside a club.

Praise aside, though, the game does have a few spots of... questionable mission design. Giving the AI access to heat-seeking missiles may not have been the best idea.
        SR 2 had some amazing details. Last I played I found a house you could enter near the water front that had a random ass cypher battle with beatboxers and all. It was wild and ruined gta5 and following SR games for me entirely
> CDPR's own Witcher 3 are in my favourites are because they're packed with a ton of nice little details that just add so much immersion to the game.

ah yes, the famously detailed Witcher 3 .. where there about 12 different voice lines in the open world that repeated endlessly, a bunch of NPCs you couldn't talk to, tons of doors you couldn't open, and a whole host of combat mechanics you never, ever needed to use because the game was piss easy
    >ah yes, the famously detailed Witcher 3

yes, the famously detailed witcher 3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xT9ZnmA3h0&list=PLMpNwDjXWh0wH-pQvAeulaTXA7\_mgbt8Y
    That's the exact same feeling I have toward Witcher 3, I gave this game 2 tries, first I got to like 60-70% of main story and stopped playing for like a year or 2 and came back to finish main story and Heart of Stone but couldn't last more than couple hours in the Blood and Wine, this game is so damn easy, you don't need to use like 90% of the things you have access to, put Quen on and just whirl through, story wise this game is good but that's not the only thing I'm looking for in an RPG
It makes sense. If you get punched in the spine by someone with pistons for arms, I don't think you'll be standing.
    funny thing is that they dont die from 1 hit lol https://imgur.com/a/9pVz6E9
        They made a change that removes NPC 1-hit protection.  Pre-2.0 you could never kill an NPC in a single hit, but now you can if you deal enough damage.
    [deleted]
        Pistons for arms and subdermal armor are both things that exist in the world of the game, though. No one gets one-shotted by a low level V, you have to upgrade the character for the effect in the video. That's no different than any other RPG.
I hate it. The instant death NPCs was one of the worst things about GTA V. You can't have much open world reactivity if the NPCs aren't able to react to things because a small breeze knocks them out.
    https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/16p6ovm/cyberpunk_2077_2020_vs_2023_comparison/k1ptif3/
    It's only some situations that your character does knock an npc out immediately with a punch, most of the time they'll fall, get up and run away or fight back, and some npcs even dodge your punch and hit back. You clearly haven't tried punching npcs enough
    You can only instant death NPCs in normal combat by commiting your stats and implants to it, though.
After Phantom Liberty, we can maybe expect a minor patch here and there, but I think they’re probably going to start reallocating the remaining devs onto future titles.

If stuff like NPC pathing still hasn’t been fixed 3 years later, I really don’t think we’ll see it in this game. 

Thankfully I think a lot of this logic is much easier to implement in Unreal Engine. They won’t have to build massive frameworks for stuff like NPC AI from scratch either.
    It's irritating how some youtubers are pushing this update as being a complete overhaul of the game and everything is fixed.

This game still seems as dead as at launch.There's nothing interactable in the world, only menus and wooden npc.
It is fantastic effort, and the devs have done amazing, but this just further highlights how the managers and bean counters at CD had completely lost touch with reality.

Even 2.0 has bugs and mechanics that aren't acceptable for a AAA game at release.
    Like what
        Halfway in the video were mostly bugs
        The game isn't done until they add in the female V from the early trailers as one of the presets.
        Actually look at the vid it highlights the bugs
            I am talking what's 'not acceptable'
You did finish it
    Yeah, it depends on what he means by "one mission." Technically, after fighting Smasher, there's still a mission, but it's just an epilogue. I actually stopped playing after beating Smasher because I already knew how the game ended and didn't need to see the epilogue (I could just watch it on Youtube).
You can download the pre-2.0 version if you just want to finish it up before going to 2.0.

Edit: At least on GOG. Dunno if you can do it on Steam.
I mean, it's not like you didn't have time dude. You're the one to blame for this.
    I know, I fucked up. Oh well it has its pros and cons I guess.
I finally beat the game day of update. Didn't open Steam and launched directly from exe. Updated right after.
It’s the shrinking horse balls all over again
    what a banger of a sentence
    how often is that mentioned in this sub lol
Now that there's car cashes and vehicular combat, it can matter. 

Before? Just one of many many things that broke immersion. Any one of them wasn't a big deal, but when it continued to add up with all of these elements, it was difficult to get immersed without something breaking it.

EDIT: I now realize the OP I was talking to was talking about burnout not shooting them out... Oops.
    What about popping tires while doing a burnout  breaks immersion...... You have any idea how hard it is do that in real life? Why are you doing never ending burnouts in a single player game like 2077 with no audience?
        I don’t understand or respect people that do them in real life with an audience either so hey.
There's a lot of things that people cry and whine about like its the end of the world that they feel like should be in the game that, in the grand scheme of things, doesn't really matter to the overall experience with this game.
    Absolutely factual.
    Like police chases....
    Agree, like I just want to play pachinko minigame :(

totally not needed for core gameplay though
    I want something very silly and simple. I want eating animations.   


The game puts such a focus on food and food vendors and cooking animations, etc. -- I wish the food items weren't just bland consumables in your inventory. I wish you could sit at a food stall and chow down on some noodles.   


It's stupid, I know. But it would make a huge difference to me.
As if we don't have better materials in 2077
Idk about you but in GTAV I was aiming for the tires every time I was in vehicle combat. It's fun to make the cars crash lol
    I'm  just talking about burnout popping, I'm happy they added bullet popping.
        Oh mb
It's because people wanted this game to be 'future GTA-V', which is why most of these are just GTA features. If you aren't into GTA that much, none of them are really that big of a deal.
its just a precedent set by other games
    By games you mean racing games where it's kind of expected and GTA where it was novelty when people found out about it now nobody really gives a shit.

It's not a big deal at all. It's a deal for like 1% of players lmao.
        It's actually not realistic to pop tires by shooting them because it doesn't happen in real life. The bullet only pass through. It was tested before. 

Only if you overinflate damaged tires they will pop.
Safety features? In MY futuristic dystopian game? No thank you.
I guess it would depend on the maker, popping the brakes just because the driver sensor say no does not mean being safe, the car should have some kind of AI to decide that
    Well yeah not saying it's the same primitive weight sensor in 2077 but just saying the idea they stop when the driver gets ejected isn't too far fetched and kinda cool.
Because people made a very big deal about the small things. That's what this video is about, not the big stuff
I mean in 2018 CDPR said that Cyberpunk "will be as polished and refined as RDR2" so they invited the comparison on themselves
It's not like RdR2s police system was very good.

And for that game they spent alot of time on details but barley made any gameplay improvements in terms of combat since the last one.


And don't get me started on how empty the world feels.
    Yeah RDR2 also suffered from police spawning
    God the police in rdr2 was do bad it stopped me playing it more than the one time. Hijack train, park in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, cops show up before you even rob it, ????. Also getting bounties while wearing masks made 0 sense. Too bad really, because I love that game but that shit is just a deal breaker and knowing Rockstar it'll never get a patch because it's singleplayer
Im gunna be real. The police shouldn't have even been touched if it weren't for the outraged. The games focus and setting doesn't have a police focus unlike gta does. Where crime is the central narrative. Police in cyberpunk are more akin to city guards in witcher. There to add character to the city, surface level interaction and funnel u or block u off from missions.

Sure u could interact with them and fight them for immersion,  but that shouldn't have been such a loud focus
    It's not even 'adding' characters to the city. They feel more like a placeholder like; just put them in there for the sake of it. I understand, I'm just baffled by how they changed the genre of this game. It was advertised as one thing then before the release as other.
        >I'm just baffled by how they changed the genre of this game.

Because games aren't finalized until they're released? How is this so hard to understand? There's another commenter in here saying they were "sold" on the game back in 2013 when they saw the initial teaser trailer. SEVEN YEARS before the game released they had formed an idea of what the game was in their head. Then when the game released as something else, it was the developers fault.

Cyberpunk feels *exactly* like The Witcher 2/3 feel. It isn't even a little bit surprising that this is how they made their game.
            > SEVEN YEARS before the game released they had formed an idea of what the game was in their head. Then when the game released as something else, it was the developers fault.

This is such revisionism. The devs spent those 7 years talking about features that would never make it into the game. The hype over this game was absolutely down to what CDPR was telling players it was going to be. Dont pretend this games release wasnt one of the biggest controversy in gaming , its only been 3 years, memory spans arent that short. Well, maybe yours is.
                >The devs spent those 7 years talking about features that would never make it into the game.

Yes, that is literally how game development works. Like how there was a functioning metro system until they play tested it and got negative feedback, so they replaced it with a fast travel system.

>The hype over this game was absolutely down to what CDPR was telling players it was going to be.

But this is on the players, no?  This isn't Sean Murray going on TV saying, "Yes, No Man's Sky will have multiplayer" and then the game releases and it turns out he was lying through his teeth. This is pretty typical, "Here's what we're aiming for." They fell short on some things and changed or improved other things. But at the end of the day it wasn't the next GTA or RDR2, which is what people wanted and expected, so players shit on it.

>Dont pretend this games release wasnt one of the biggest controversy in gaming...

Well sure, but largely because it was a technical disaster for consoles. Not because it was some hollow shell of a game that didn't do what it meant to do. I mean the gameplay loop is essentially the exact same today as it was at launch. There's been no big changes in quests, NCPD scanner events, gigs, hidden gems, life paths, branching quests, romanceable NPCs, etc. All of this released more or less as it was intended to be.

Vehicle combat, updated skill trees, more guns, all of these are cool but don't functionally change what this game is and has always been. People coming in here saying that it still isn't GTA or that *now* the game is playable is so bizarre to me. These people are saying they won't play the game for what the game was meant to be until it becomes what they want it to be. Such entitlement.
                    Its funny, people blame the marketing but I've heard people tell me they thought this game was gonna be like the Witcher, Mass Effect, Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, GTA, bioshock, etc.  Which are all very different games. And also it was gonna have the narrative freedom of Disco Elysium! (which disco itself can only do due to the very small scale).

&nbsp;

And for giggles when I asked them where they got this idea most of them linked me back to the same videos that said nothing of the sort.  ALOT of heavy interpretation going on lol
I'm with you. I had high hopes for the patch and it's welcome, but it didn't address the fundamental reasons why the game's immersion still feels like a PS2 game. Shame, because the world is so big and beautiful and the story was decent. But the zombie NPCs really do ruin it.
Ah, you noticed it too. If i involve myself in a gang vs cop fight and fight the gang, suddenly i'm public enemy number one.

Same if there's a cop on a street corner and a gang opens up on me, that's somehow my fault too?
    I'm actually wondering if this is a bug because it wasn't like this before 2.0 police scan jobs actually have the cops chase you now too which doesn't seem like it'd be on purpose
        Hopefully it gets sorted
    gta vice city was ahead of its time
    I don't think the real life police would be happy with you if you randomly involved yourself in their work, even if it's helping them
But you are literal serial killer. Why would they not shoot you?
    stop the copium, open world AI is still meh at best.

If someone shoots a cop, but the cop started blasting you as a reaction to that, it means AI is shit and not some mental gymnastics justifying unintended behaviour.
Deus ex human revolution cops blast whoever attacks them and not you by default... its not some revolutionary feature.

Also its not something that ruins the experience, but its still immersion breaking if it happens
Yeah, but i noticed of I try and help out the police, the second I open fire, they all turn red.  I don't know if that's intended, but I dislike it immensely.
    i did help out a police officer yesterday after patch, in pacifica i saw police having a shootout with the scavs and i killed the scavs and then the police guy thanked me. so it is there, you might've hit a policeman by ricochet or something
        Yes i think police turn on you if you hurt a civilian. I kinda like it because i cannot just be throwing grenades when a civilian or a hostage is near. I have to pick them apart without hurting innocents or else the police will come after you.
    I mean if you walked up to an active police shoot out and started blasting people irl I’m pretty sure the cops would shoot you too lol.
What illusion? The gameplay loop is not GTA and revolves around engaging with the police.

Name one main/side mission in the game in which you are directly fighting/running away from the police by design? 

This was the problem with some of the criticism at launch. Many people thinking this was supposed to be GTA: Night City.

Unfortunately as a result, there was MUCH MORE that CDPR could have focused on but instead decided to focus on a feature to appease the GTA crowd.
Yea, but rockstar games aren't RPGs either. They can focus  their time on detail when you dont have to incorporate a skill system, multiple dialogue options for the protagonist, and many other ways  that characters can interact with your world. You are one protagonist that Rockstar can model their game after, not multiple different players with different builds etc.

I feel like Im on rails with Rockstar games, which is great because they always tell a great story, but I like to have some freedom in BGS games/CDPR games at the sacrifice of detail in the world.

I mean, you can tell RDR2 dev time was mainly spent on how detailed the world was, but combat was shallow, you couldnt create your own character, and your character had no real "skills" or customization other than cosmetic.

Still, two great games IMO, just depends on your taste.
    Also Rockstar games have almost no choices in their story, absolutely zero consquences and branching quests, no different approach to solving most quests, the combat system is guns/very simple melee/explosives, absolutely no abilities to deal with and their balance, no items with their stats and balancing, no cyberware, etc. So it's very easy for them to make sure that the world feels alive if all of the stuff above they don't have to do.

People compare CP2077 to GTA V or RDR 2 don't mention the latter games have no skill tree, not even different dialogue choices, no RPG-style loot, no levels, no abilities, no balancing, and so on and so on. It's like Cyberpunk has to be on their level while simultaneously adding a whole layer of games systems that RPGs have.
    Imagine Rockstar and CDPR teaming up.

Rockstar focusing on open world.

CDPR focusing on combat.

???

Profit.
        Can't say CDPR does combat particularly well (all the Witcher games are wonky as fuck).
            Still better than shooting/cover gameplay of GTA
    RDR2 DEFINITELY has RPG elements on another level compared to past titles. Either way, it doesn’t matter. I just wish CDPR implemented the most basic of fucking features for open world titles that Rockstar has set the standard for. 

It doesn’t need to be a GTA clone. Just fucking implement what is expected of an open world title in 2020. Its infuriating.
Open world. Free roam but linear storyline and progression. So mostly sandbox fun

Thats rockstar


Open world. Free roam. But action RPG with leveling, dialogue, multiple ways to complete missions, cater to different user builds etc etc

Thats cyberpunk


Ppl go oh it's an open world game with guns and cars. Let's compare it with gta. It's not even comparable. It's more compatible with skyrim but replace horses with cars
RDR2 ruined Open World games for me. After seeing everything work so perfectly, it's hard to go back. 

Everything else feels so lifeless. 

I wish they could sell their NPC AI tech.
    For me, what made RDR2 special was the texture.

When you buy things from the store, you walk up to the shelf and grab them. Or thumb through a product catalogue physically placed on the counter.

When you clean your gun, there's an animation. When you eat food, there's an animation. Skin an animal? Animation.

In Cyberpunk, this is silly, I know -- but I want that level of immersion. I want to buy a bowl of noodles from a street vendor, sit down, and eat it... Animations and all.

I just want more texture to the world. It's such a cool setting, and I want to touch it.
        Yeah, I agree with that! There's just so much to it. Everything is made to feel more immersive. They really went as far as possible to remove the "seams" of the game. 

It really is an incredible contribution to gaming. Really takes things to the next level.
    The bounty system and the cops sucked so much ass in rdr2 it was embarrassing. The game was fantastic otherwise, though it could use more random events, or a timer that reset them once in a while.
        Yeah, I'll agree with that. The bounty system was probably the biggest flaw. There were times you attracted heat when it just couldn't be possible.
    Does RDR 2 have:

* level up system,
* different dialogue choices and consequences,
* crafting,
* rpg-style loot with stats,
* skill tree,
* many abilities,
* character customisation,
* different builds,
* different ways of solving the same quest,
* and more typical RPG elements.

All of that takes so much development time Rockstar Games saves in their games. They just have to make main story for their games, like 15-20 guns, a few melee weapons with 2 attack animations per, and a bunch of explosives. After that they call it a day and just can focus on making open world feel believable. No shit Cyberpunk isn't on their level, the game would take 15 years to make.
    RDR2, GTA4 and Watchdogs 2 have some of the best open worlds I've ever played. Not alot of open world games can compare to those 3
They aren't comparable games or studios.....
Rockstar has decades of experience and multiple iterations with this type of game. Open worlds are all smoke-and-mirrors and they know exactly where to put their efforts, and where they can cut corners. Cyberpunk plays like a first iteration… because it is!
    Are the Witcher games not considered open world?
        bout to say, witcher 3 is absolutely a version of that open world. just 90% wilderness.
            yea, but also a very limited character powerset, you know one of the few ways geralt can interact with combat and missions.  Cyberpunk has a lot more variety in how you play.   That's always a pain in the ass to design around.
        Only when it fits my narrative
    As well as they like spend decade to make one.

GTA 5 Launches: September 17, 2013
    I mean RDR2 is kinda an exception because the smoke an mirrors is often replaced with just straight up over the top detail.

Like the railway construction crew that slowly works their way linking two lines, you can watch them cut down trees, hammer in each rail segment. The line actually progresses in real time and eventually it completes. This is almost too much detail. It only makes sense for RDR2 because it ties in so deeply to the themes

Also, before the release of RDR2,  TW3 was kinda the gold standard for flavourful world in games. Farmers farming, dock workers in novigrad carrying cargo, people washing clothes, boatyards making boats. It was all smoke-and-mirrors in the sense that none of those systems would progress if you stopped to look at them but nobody was gonna look at them for that long.

Cyberpunk is step back in this sense, very few of the NPC's are doing anything.
        Red Dead Redemption 2 is probably the greatest open world game (in terms of detail and immersion) ever conceived.
    It’s a first iteration on a well-developed concept.  There’s no excuse here.  You gonna stan for Tesla next?
        By a studio that doesn't have Rockstars developers or leads.

Like I wouldn't expect CDPR to make a perfect Mario game out the gate cos they aren't Nintendo.
        That's like saying you should know how to play a sport by reading a book.
        No other game studios did anything remotely closer to Rockstar though. For a first iteration, I would say CDPR did quite well. I was one of the people who was surprised that they were even able to release the game. The make Witcher 1 which is low-production quality passion project. Witcher 2 which cannot even be called an open-world. The Witcher 3 where they build onto the first two games and made something great. And then a first-person action RPG with completely different world and gameplay elements which would definitely be compared to GTA-series. They were crazy even to begin this project.
        > There’s no excuse here.

I dunno, maybe you could point out how Rockstar has thousands of employees, spends half a billion on a game, and is going to go 15 years between GTAV and GTAVI because that's how hard it is to develop a true next gen successor to V?
considering I never managed to finish GTA V story and beat Cyberpunk a couple of times, yeah, well, I agree, rockstar games' details are crazy but I don't care as I like playing games instead of looking at the traces my boots leave for hours, but enjoy your thing
I mean if Rockstar ever gets combat and RPG elements to be even 1/10th that of CDPR games, then we'll talk
It was never meant to compare to GTA. They do different things and focus on different things. 

There are MANY other things CP2077 does better than GTA as well....
gta hasnt evolved since gta 3 been the same game and quest design , talk to npc follow them to quest area/ shooting gallery repeat. hopefully rockstar changes it up for the next one but im not holding my breath
    GTA V added aspects like planning massive heists over the course of several missions and three main, playable protagonists. It was pretty revolutionary for 2013.
Maybe old school rockstar but current Rockstar is no different than EA.
    You're comparing GTA Online to EA practices. 

That has nothin to do with their ability to build and create a game. Something they are still masters at
        Not really I think RDR2 and GTA 5 has flaws a lot of flaws that some people over look just because its Rockstar. I definitely have no hope for gta 6 seeing that everyone that made the series what it is left the company. It is definitely going to be preachy
            >It is definitely going to be preachy.

They’ve already talked about how it’s no longer going to "punch down" with its humor like their games have in the past. Which is about as lame to hear from Rockstar as it would be to hear from the creators of South Park or something. It has this arrogant "we are going to be better than our predecessors who built it all" air to it.
                But it also insinuates that they are above certain people
 The same people they are supposed to fight for its kinda funny
                    Didn’t think about that. That’s a very good and hilarious point.
Much improved imo. I use to hate the handling of the cars. Now it’s really good imo. I enjoy driving in this game now.
Some cars feel like a dream now and some feel like boats, so kind of the same as before just with different options, they did change how you purchase them though which is nice
No, the driving is great now.
The Type-66 cars drive super nice even before the patch. Only vehicle I could actually get from point A to point B without killing a bunch of civilians lol
There’s enough videos showcasing all that surely? These comparisons are good. Devs can look at them and say we need to do better.
Because they're made in bad faith. Is this your first day in this sub? It's been this way for 3 years.
[deleted]
    Define "immersive open world" in your eyes.

To me Night City and its ambience is pretty immersive.
Yeah they're bullshitters. Everyone's an entitled critic.
Many other games have launched successfully with solid basic features and gameplay. Cyberpunk had one of the most pathetic launches in gaming history with an unfinished product and still multiple years later it’s still an unfinished pile of shit. You’re over here complaining that people had “too high of expectations” when in reality people just expected a game to not be unfinished and to not be so fucking broken even after multiple years of patches. Look at Starfield, it lived up to his massive hype and actually feels like it’s in a solid release state on launch. Cry as much as you want in defense of a game you are biased towards, but you’re living too far from reality if you really think the issue is players who expected a game in a finished state not only at launch but also multiple years of patches later. Cyberpunk historically had one of the worst game launches of all time and it’s still in a state that would have gotten heavy criticism if this current version after patch 2.0 was the version at launch.
    Why are you on a CP2077 reddit if you aren't too fond of the game?

Everyone else is celebrating the game now while you remain bitter.
        It's a good question that these people never tend to answer.
    I think Starfield is a great example. It’s missing tons of the “little details” an open world Rockstar game has. And I think most people didn’t expect those in it, but many did for Cyberpunk. I was also comparing people’s expectations of Cyberpunk’s current state still being underwhelming, not launch which was obviously bad.
    lol the game is fine

touch grass
welcome to r/cyberpunkgame, where everyone hates cyberpunk lmfao
If you want actual constructive conversation: /r/LowSodiumCyberpunk
Read the title, does it say 2020 vs 2023, or does it say “every update made in chronological order with a timestamp”?
    Yeah it's odd imo. People bought it in 2020 and a lot of them returned it. They call it the 2.0 update, hoping to get those people back, so comparing 1.0 to 2.0 seems like it makes sense. I never got the feeling that the video was trying to say "look, they only fixed this issue now."
        OP literally states, "It's fixed now," for some issues that have been fixed for over a year.
            It's ok man reading is hard for a lot of us.
    Maybe watch the video with the comments before making a fool of yourself? OP definitely tries to make it seem like some things which have been fixed for quite a while were only just now fixed with 2.0.
If they were fixed why is it still in the game? Video doesn't say all of these were fixed or not fixed by this single update, it just shows what's the state of the game
    The one about cops spawning behind you literally hasn't been a thing for years. I get that some of you stepped away from the game due to a bad launch and are just now coming back to it, but stop acting like you know what the state of the game has been these past 3 years.
        This is not about that at all. Just compares launch with 2.0 what else should have compared it to? 1.6 or what? This just shows all the improvement from start, it doesn't matter when it was fixed
        They still teleported in like they were beamed down from the enterprise, just further away.

Or you'd just get drones chasing you.
Oh cool, so the update fixed even less than advertised lol
Key word there is "some".
I can't believe people are calling these "great little details". GTA and Saints Row are city sandboxes that had these things figured out 15+ years ago.
glad to se this sub is still just as trash this mine as well be a gta subreddit
    It was honestly not that bad before Cyberpunk hit the news cycle. Now it's insufferable again.
        The same morons are probably back again.
Basic features?
    GTA San Andreas, which came out in 2004, figured out how to do shooting out tires and firing while driving. Yes, most these are basic features.
        Another victim of hasty generalization logical fallacy. Most games don't have this sort of features for a reason. It's not basic at all...
        They are very much not basic features for a game. And they are in the game.

They said basic features were Still missing so I ask again. What basic features.
    The vehicle features were in the original ads for the game lol.

These were release features delayed 3 years lmao
        You mean shooting while driving. Because the trailers only showed the scripted car chases which are in the base game.
            Lol no. They showed full vehicle customization and much of the current shit.

Get out of here.

    That was so they could avoid spoilers and copyright strike anybody that does post spoilers - they gave otherwise full freedom to give opinions / reviews from content creators and journalists and it had an average of like 92/100 so far. I'll be very surprised if it turns out to be bad

The original CP2077 launch also got panned before release by reviewers. The game had average like 65/100 before launch in 2020, except for PC where it had good reviews
AI behaviour is not nitpicking
    The only AI this video had was citizens being punched (didn't show them being shot which they do react differently to) and citizen driving AI which isn't the focus of the game and isn't that much worse than GTA. Also the video handily leaves out the new cop chase AI which is fucking great and brutal to try and escape on higher wanted levels.

So yes, critisizing citizen ai driving or them being punch (like people are going to fucking do that all the time) is 100% nitpicking.
        Played GTA 4 recently, and this is way way way behind that game in open world crown interaction and reaction on foot and for vehicles.  


Of course rockstar are masters of this stuff, and cyberpunk clearly made a decision to not focus on it nearly as much.
could not disagree more. small details like this are what make or break immersion and world building, and the attention to minor details is what made rdr2 one of the greatest games of all time

&#x200B;

i am quite happy w 2.0, but this is all a bit disappointing to see lol
    Yeah I don't see how it's bad to be nitpicky. I'm seeing people say the same things on the Starfield sub. I absolutely love that game, but there are definitely a few immersion breaking things that I would have liked to see differently.

Like a big gripe of mine in open world games is that NPCs only exclusively talk in things related to the game world. That's why Rockstar is so good at these things. Sometimes you meet characters who have issues that are not directly related to one of the gangs and talk about things that don't have anything to do with the game's lore.

Cyberpunk definitely seems to have fixed some of those things. One of my biggest complaints at launch was how the city just didn't feel lived in and that's definitely been improved.
    When are you ever going to park your car in the middle of the sidewalk and then sit there to see how watch pedestrian walk around it? This is something that, if it weren’t for this video, the majority will never think about.
        lol that's just a way to test npc pathfinding my friend

&#x200B;

the pathfinding should be there
            Pedestrians aren’t pathfinding in the same way that other npcs are, they are just walking to walk, they don’t have a destination
            You have no clue how game development works
    For every hundred people on Reddit who say this is "important" there are a thousand who don't give a shit or probably don't even know these issues exist.

RDR was an immersive game. So much so that it sacrificed gameplay.  One of its biggest criticisms is that it's slow paced/boring and annoying to play because your character takes 30 seconds to do anything. It was a good game but it was hardly "one of the greatest" give me a break. Way overhyped.
        you're literally the only person i've ever heard say that

&#x200B;

rdr2 is one of the greatest games ever made, and i hate rockstar. and the reception and reaction to all its details when it released proves you wrong entirely.

&#x200B;

what even do you get out of defending mediocrity ?
            It's literally all over Reddit alone if you search for it. 

I'm calling about BS nitpicking. What do you get out of being a negative downer all the time
                hopefully more details in my games and less silly things that break my immersion
            It is a snoozer, that's a pretty common take. Masterfully done and incredibly boring
            RDR2 greatest game ever made? lol. I agree with the other person. The realism makes the game a snooze fest. I get so bored playing it.
                Easily in my top 3 but I love a slow burn. I absolutely loved it. Much more than Cyberpunk that's for sure.
                I've got several friends who can't make it passed 4-5 hours in RDR2 because, "It takes too long to do anything." Some people want to play a video game, not replace their reality.
                    Same for me. I enjoy slow pace games like RPGs and turn based. But I don't want to play a game where I have to wait for long animations to complete to do simple task.
            To be honest, the shooting and combat are pretty meh, especially compared to how amazing the rest of the game is.
            Rdr2 is one of the greatest games ever made yes, but it's not perfect and it's most certainly overhyped.
        >For every hundred people on Reddit who say this is "important" there are a thousand who don't give a shit or probably don't even know these issues exist

I'm sure the ratio isn't as skewed as you're making it out to be. You make it sound like only reddit ever takes issue with a game. 

>RDR was an immersive game. So much so that it sacrificed gameplay. One of its biggest criticisms is that it's slow paced/boring and annoying to play because your character takes 30 seconds to do anything. It was a good game but it was hardly "one of the greatest" give me a break. Way overhyped.

Your opinion isn't as widely shared, going off of how well-received that game was. 

I personally like that everything takes time to do. I'm not in a rush. Folks are free to dislike that. Maybe the game wasn't built for them.
            I know what the ratio is because I now the average evergday person who plays video games in their spare time and doesn't browse the internet every other moment. The people who buy these games and buy FIFA and buy microtransactions all the time. They *do not* care about these "immersive" things or these tiny bugs and issues they will most likely never see. 

A game being critically successful doesn't make it the greatest game of all time. Brother rdr2 didn't even win game of the year. Let me reiterate though, I think it's a great game with a great story and I enjoyed it immensely when I played but it is lacklustre when it comes to gameplay, the single most important thing in a game.
                Brother, RDR2 won tons of game of the year awards, just not the one from the game awards. It may not be your personal opinion but it widely regarded as one of the best games of all time. A quick google search will show you that it is indeed, regarded by many, as such.
I disagree completely the game has been out for three now things like the pedestrian AI or the underwater animation are an issue and affect immersion but are simple fixes I hope
    you almost never see the underwater shadow, though I'm not denying it's ugly as fuck
    Underwater (shadow) animation is ultra minor, as you barely ever spend time underwater, not to mention looking for your own shadow there. But NPCs AI was and still will be very noticeable.
        Barely spend time underwater = you don't need to fix it?
            Literally yes. There is a thing called priorities in game dev and that is literally at the bottom of the list for a game that has like three side missions that involve water.
            Basically, it makes it less important than other, bigger issues.

Like Pedestrian AI.
                Yes, but still on the list. A very long list. Even though game is fun and all
    The underwater shadow is a very hard thing to fix, V's anim rig is deformed on purpose so that nothing gets in front of the camera, this causes the rig to look janky and shadows are casted the way they are. To change the shadow they either have to use a "proxy" entity and assign that to the player, or change the entire player anim rig.
Thats because OP literally showed things relating to older patches. Only about 2 things out of a massive laundry list rwlating to changes in 2.0 was showcased here

Ur being fed a narrative instead of actually checking it out urself
I mean... if 9 years of development doesn't do it...

I'm not sure we need another star citizen...

Even if the game is still kind of rushed, at some point you have to pay the people working on it... So it needed to come out, and since they extended the "need to polish" excuse for the 6month release delay... They couldn't hide behind a beta, especially for a narrative game whose main story is so short.

Maybe they bit more than they could chew... and they needed to rip the band-aid...
    It was in development for 4/5 years, after blood and wine. Unless you count concept.
Nine of these things in the video impact ur game experience with the campaign unless ur spending a huge chunk of ur time blocking traffic. Swimming or doing weird shit in cars thats not part of normal gameplay. 

Nobody has yet called out any bugs or issues with the fundamental core of the game which is the campaign and RPG element

Everything is whinging about gta esque immersion for which this is not
No. It's more like the modern deus ex games, or even 3D Fallout
No, and it isn't trying to be.
What do you want them to do, turn back time and redo launch day? There's nothing they can do but try to fix the shit that they have done and that's what they're doing now.
    I wanted the game to be fixed when I pre-ordered it. Some of these features are basic features that have been in 20+ year old games.
        Okay.

What is your comment going to achieve though. It is a blank, pointless statement.
            Same as you, no?
            People need to leave this poor little studio alone. They’ve been working for YEARS to make a game that works like a AAA game should. It’s crazy how not picky people are being. They need to get past it and leave it be
            Your comments are in the same level slugger
            Not a blank statement. The meaning behind it is that cp owners collected money and the game is still broken 3 years after release which is ridiculous
Cope loser
    Cope with what? Why are you even here?
starfield? you mean the game where NPC dont care if you aim at them or shoot around?
I think it's probably because that little wire you always use is in your wrist, so they hide the gloves in the actual gameplay view. Your jacket sleeves also get rolled up in first person too, also for the sake of cyberware I imagine. Mantis Blades don't really make sense if they've gotta go through your jacket sleeve lol
    Wouldn't it be crazy if they made the gloves have a little hole for the little wire
        Would raise the poly count on the models, probably tank performance!
            I mean, it'd just be a texture remodel. From what I understand you wouldn't need to change the gloves model, just add a transparent texture where the hole is. Heck, depending on how small of a hole we're talking it wouldn't need transparency.
            Wouldnt be much of an issue considering how various clothes have different poly counts anyways. Plus, it wouldnt be very many polys anyways.
            I legit cannot tell if thats sarcasm or not.
                Yes it was supposed to be..!
                    Oooh damn sorry then lmao.

And yeah, a sleek and good one... ppl do be saying stupid shit like that with straight face, seen it multiple times on this sub alone.
        gloves with holes?? nonsense. makes more sense to wear gloves which dissapear in First person view
        My characters are still bald when they drive a vehicle.
I wish that arm mods didn't get rid of your nail art.
All night city clothing has a LOT of padding in them, due to all the 80s future punk influences.
    [removed]
        More like 28C
    I had to headcannon that it was armored because muh immersion. But now the gear doesn't have armor ;_; my poor flapjacks.

All bodies are <fine3 but they can be smaller sometimes, particularly outside of the nubile/bait anime waifus. Grown adults also come in many sizes, and the mid-size V's are just on the larger side [*relative to her frame*]. And they are further enhanced by the way clothing bulks up.

Though the larger V's also have my condolences because they get a pretty bad compression effect on the other side of the scale :p
    This guy lores
The existence of clothing with some sort of advanced built-in fake boob technology seems perfectly reasonable in the CP2077 world.  Unfortunately only the elites can afford the clothing that allows for customization, while us plebeians are stuck with one [cup] size fits all.
That's irritating.
    It is. It's such a small immersion breaker. I understand if they didn't have to time or budget to make deformables, or make 3 models of every top... but then just remove the bust size option.
        They couldn't let guys have dick size without letting the ladies make their boobs bigger, and dick size adjustability was a core design pillar of the game, immutable.
            Jokes aside I was really kind of expecting, not for the sake of obscenity, that if they had cut/uncut, that they would have the bravery to add innies/outies [to put it politely]. I know the snippy isn't a "natural" occurrence, while the other is, but I am all about some body positivity and they shoulda given the femme body the same attention [clothing/modeling].
agree if you have a huge bust size, your melons suddenly shrink....thank good modders will fix that again, after the liberty dlc came out so they dont have to do patch work twice
I think it's one of those things where no matter what hair style you have it will look this one way when wearing a hat. So I think there are a handful of hairstyles where it will look normal, and many ways where it won't.

The easiest way to tell would be to switch your hair to bald and try it out.
The fact that you could get thrown out of the car through the windshield was dope.  I rememeber GTA5 having so much worse physics, it was a huge step backwards, but the more busy looking world sort of hid the lack of complex physics.
    To be fair, the cars in IV were too wobbly, V they were too sturdy but it wasn't as bad as IV's wobbliness.
        I don't think they were too wobbly
Still the best crime sandbox game to date. Super underrated
    You think GTA IV is underrated?
        He spelled sleeping dog wrong clearly
have you seen what happens to reckless bikers irl?

I honestly wish I never did.
    i wish they would make it so if you die in cyberpunk you die in real life
        okay 👍
    r/meatcrayon
        Why in God's name did I click this link...
There is a perk called Stuntjock that lets you either jump out or slide out of your vehicle.  I haven't tried it on a bike, though, but I'm sure it works
    I'll have to get it; old habits die hard and I fear I'll never learn to respect the vehicles after years of a certain play style lol. I started fresh since I didn't really want to sit and reallocate so many skill points. Just made sense to take the time to learn them over levelling rather than in one go, for me at least.
Well, that would kill you irl, so a near death experience is getting off easy.
People get internet points either way though lol, just stupidity
The Bethesda approach.
    At least Bethesda doesn't leave console owners hanging. CDPR is very PC-centric so modding for their games only cover (less than) half the fanbase.
        Over half of CP2077 sales were on PC. It was 56% PC, 28% Playstation, and 17% Xbox. Obviously the numbers may have changed since then, but yeah.
    At least Bethesda actually made Starfield feel like a fucking game compared to this broken piece of shit at launch.
        Well, Cyberpunk certainly has its own feel these days. It always had, and now very much so, had its own vibe. Now it's just 10x better.
        Cope, Starfield is the same shit as Cyberpunk but its a Bethesda game.
            I take it you played Starfield then? And Cyberpunk at launch? 

Cyberpunk crashed multiple times for me in a 2 hour span, had multiple physics bugs and the very first chase mission broke for me to the point where I had to restart the game for it to work. The game was a clusterfuck, had multiple mechanics that were half assed and overhyped. And I don’t just mean the way the game played, I mean what they actually implemented was executed in a broken state. Combat, police spawning, vehicle mechanics. 

You can criticize Starfield for it’s mechanics. That’s all personal preference. But you seriously can not sit here and say the game was broken on launch. Or that it isn’t at least cohesive. I played the early access and had a couple physics bugs in my 15 hours of playing, but nothing game breaking. Mainly just funny stuff like asteroids or random ships spinning. It was nowhere NEAR the level of mess as Cyberpunk or even Skyrim at launch. You people just find reasons to shit on Bethesda because it’s Bethesda.

        I played Skyrim at launch on the 360 and hard agree. While the main quest went mostly smoothly, the rest of the sidequests were bugged to hell. I remember following [this guide](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Glitches) because some quest rewards were straight up unobtainable because of quest-related bugs.
        I remember coming back to Skyrim years after release and they never fixed things like getting shouted through walls and stuck there, and a damned main quest breaking bug that blocked all progress and you had to start again. And then they just left it. It was appalling, and presumably those bugs are STILL there!!
            [deleted]
                Set aside all of the bad glitches and poor launch, Skyrim is highly anticipated because of its legacy.

The Elder Scrolls Franchise is one of the longest and  pretty well known franchise within the gaming world.


Skyrim really captivated all of its audience because of the seemingly vast world and the immersion of the game also makes it such a memorable game to many others.

I, for one, invested 2 days of just playing Skyrim because the world is interesting and unique. The NPCs have their own routine and not just static A.I who only acts when the player is nearby.

They react to your actions and will confront you.


I mean I can put a bucket on to a trader and steal all of his shit without getting caught. For a 2011 game, that was groundbreaking. Can't do that shit in CP77.

Skyrim is also one of the quotable games as you can say anything an NPC said other gamers would most likely recognise it.
        I got skyrim on release. Got about 70hrs in and somehow over the course of 2, possibly 3 updates, something caused my save file(s) to totally bork. Like just randomly while playing a bunch of textures wouldn't load properly and objects in the environment would just be a flat purple placeholder one and would eventually CTD. 



Then even if you didn't have that going on, it would 100% CTD when trying to enter very specific interior cells. Even if you COC'd in the console there it would crash. One of those was an area required to progress the main story, and even if you tried to just do other random stuff it was getting more and frequent. I was staggering saves but by the time I fully realized how bad of a problem it was I would have had to go way to far back just to test if that would fix it. I had to restart entirely and then didn't have any issues like that since. I remember looking it up back than and wasn't the only one with those same 2 issues.


Nothing like the broken save think, but FO3 and NV, Oblivion, and Morrowind were all "crash at least once every hour or two" experiences even years after release without outside mods. 


CP2077 I played 2 back to back playthroughs of about 100hrs each and I think it CTDed maybe 3 times. Other than quirky glitchy NPC  animations and the like I had no other issues.
            God I wish I had your luck. I ended up crafting and disassembling so much that I hit that weird glitch that completely and irreversibly bricked your save (was patched later, but the save is irreversibly bricked)
        "I was there Gandalf. I was there 3,000 years ago.  I was there the day the strength of Men failed."
        Skyrim on 1st gen ps3's, there was a point where you couldn't go under water without your game crashing instantly. I couldn't play because my most recent saves were me in a cave where the only exit was to swim.  I specifically had to write an email to Bethesda detailing the problem, because they wouldn't patch it.  Cool thing was someone on their team responded to me and their patch a week or two later fixed it.
        Lmao no. 

I played Skyrim on the 360 launch day, and I got to beat the story.

Cyberpunk is not even playable period on PS4 and Xbox One

Stop wearing them rose tinted glasses
        I had the game launch day on 360 and I have zero clue what you're talking about dude.  The only game breaking bug at launch was a PS3 file size issue that caused the save to keep growing until it broke the game.  It was only on the PS3 and was officially patched shortly after.  There were zero mods for us console players back then and it worked fine.  

Taking into account the last Gen versions of 2077, this launch was so much worse.  Anyone that thinks otherwise either didn't play either game at launch, are cherry picking versions they're referring back to, or are completely delusional (yes I know this is the cyberpunk sub so that's a distinct possibility).

As to the updates, you have to remember they *couldn't*, or at least chose not to, patch the game so significantly it broke games on past consoles.  Cyberpunk went the other route (Xbox one and PS4 did not get the 2.0 update because it changed the recommended specs of the game).  There was also the issue of internet bandwidth back then.  Patches weren't nearly as massive as they are now, yet still took forever to download.

Edit - lmao dude gave the most snarky fanboy response and blocked me so I couldn't even reply.  😂  In response to his dumb ass reply though, I also had no issues on Xbox series X aside from blatant missing features meant to be added, but I can objectively view this game as a failed launch overall...
        I don’t know about that. While I was only a teenager when Skyrim came out, I remember it being a really fun experience at launch. I couldn’t even enjoy Cyberpunk at launch, it was seriously rough.
            Skyrim was much more broken than Cyberpunk. PS3 version literally stopped working when your save file got to a certain size. Was literally a myriad of game breaking bugs. Bricked consoles, bricked entire save datas.

It's hilarious anyone thinks cyberpunk was that broken at all, it's not even in my top 10 top game broken releases. Could and should have been better but it ran and didn't brick things, and you could get lucky and have a full play through with no bugs.

Gamers opinions are much stricter on what's acceptable now, but they also forget quickly

It's funny how you Google something like broken game launches and nowhere mentions the fact Battlefield 4 literally wasn't playable for 6 months. That's how you do a broken release, and that wasn't even that long ago!

Sim city, spore, mcc, assassins creed unity, Arkham Knight. Battlefront 2, wwe 2k20. Some truly shitty releases.
                Agreed. imo, the Cyberpunk bugs were never the main issue with this game. Most of its huge problems came from how misleading the marketing was and the insane amount of hype. They sold us on some mythical dream game.  


Compared to good ol' Arkham Knight that literally was unplayable for me on release, Ac Unity with the part of the map my character couldn't walk through... or hell even the recent Jedi Survivor with the choppiest stuttery mess of a game ever.
                    Yeah, I can only presume people think cyberpunk was more broken simply because more players played it. For an older head like me I can't get my head around it, it was never that broken
                So the PS3 version was broke, not Skyrim in general.

On PC it was fine at launch.

Much like CP2077, ironically. The console versions had the most issues.

The worst issues with CP2077 at launch were fundamental design and resources.
        A decade and a couple of remasters later, I still didn't get past a game breaking bug. If I recall correctly, the game constantly crashed when trying to take a boat to a location. (Whiterun?)

The only bug I remember from the launch version of CP2077 is still in the 2.0 version. It's Jackie walking straight though a locker in the Sandra Dorsett mission.
        I have played skyrim 1.0 extensively it wasn't that bad
        I’ve played hundreds of hours of Skyrim on pc without ever touching a mod, you’re totally full of shit if you claim that even a majority of people couldn’t beat the game because it was broken
            There were so many bugs like being launched into space and the dragons flying backwards and Pastinak or whatever never landing
            He's not saying it's broken right now but speaking on the initial state. Of course you can beat the game now since the game is 10 years old.
                I bought it launch day on Xbox 360, I remember no issues that were game breaking.  Game crashing occasionally, yes, which were patched out fairly quickly.

The "game breaking bugs" the person was referring to only existed on PS3.  In that respect, 2077 was way worse including the last Gen versions.
                    I recall a bug on PC that crashed the game every single time it autosaved. It was bad
                    I played on ps3 and never had bugs that stopped my progress or bricked my save.
                    https://venturebeat.com/games/technically-disastrous-skyrim-is-bethesdas-most-solid-release-yet/

You realize a bunch of people played 2077 on pc with no issues right, just like people did on Skyrim. PS3 users were the worst effected but they were there for each console 

Just because you were one of the people that didn't have issues doesn't mean that was the reality for everyone. Having a whole current gen console not being able to play a game is pretty bad

Skyrim is notoriously at the top of worst releases ever, I attached another link comparing 2077 to Skyrim and people voted Skyrim being worse and this was in 2020 at the peak of the glitches in cyberpunk

I'll acknowledge that there's a chance that your single experience could be more telling then the masses who experienced both launches. There's a chance they're all misremembering it since it was 10 years ago
                        So every link you posted, in both article and comments specifically mention the PS3 bug I mentioned.  That was that.  Was there a long list of bugs in general?  Yeah, have you seen the length of patches of Baldur's Gate 3?  Patch 1 fixed over 1000 bugs and is probably going to be GOTY.

Cyberpunk had baaaad bugs on multiple systems, and obviously removed intended features at release, across the board, which we're now getting a glimpse of.  It's generally regarded as one of the worst launches ever for a game.

I could keep pulling links but I've got dinner to tend to.
                            Both are regarded as terrible launches, I acknowledged that ps3 was the main culprit so you'd actually engage with what I said but you don't seem to want to do that 

One of the links I mentioned had people talking about issues on Xbox and pc, just because ps3 was the worst doesn't mean there weren't major issues elsewhere. I'm not sure I see your point

        Skyrim UI is still unplayable, even WITH SkyUI.
        Skyrim bricked my PS3, so yeah.

Edit: PS3 got autocorrected to PS4. Hate that shit.
        Uh, I definitely beat the main quest multiple times without any mods. I didn't play it all the way back at launch though
            [deleted]
                Hell, I couldn't make it to the chopping block in the intro due to the physics engine bugging out at more than 60fps. The carriages just flipped into the sky
                    Fallout 4 had an issue at launch on PC where if you were playing at above 100 FPS you could lock the game trying to exit a terminal. I had to replay so much of the game each time it hardlocked and had to start quick-saving before accessing any terminal in case it happened until I found the issue.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3s4y20/psa\_getting\_stuck\_at\_terminals\_here\_is\_a\_fix/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3s4y20/psa_getting_stuck_at_terminals_here_is_a_fix/) 

It had a workaround, but it was pretty dumb issue to have. My monitor has a button to change refresh rate and so I enabled vsync and when entering a terminal I'd set it to 60hz, then readjust it back to 144hz when I'd left the terminal.
                Yep same for me on pc, literally couldn't progress
                I never had that bug but you were on PC, you could have also just phased through the door with TCL.
        >the main quest was literally unbeatable because it was so bugged.

So, you think people on consoles just... couldn't play the game at launch? And people just ignored that?

C'mon, lol

Makes me feel old that it's been so long since Skyrim launched that people will just say whatever about it.
        Yeah, Cyberpunk was *bad* but I lost 2 entire saves to bugs in skyrim.
I really wish they would do this, if they are done with the game at least let the public do what they want with it and make it the game it always should have been,
    They're also done with the engine it seems, so they don't really need to be overprotective.
        Hopefully they move to Unreal Engine 5. Should hopefully help them make more stable games.
            Yup, they announced a bit ago they are moving exclusively to UE5. I hear it’s really good so I’m glad they made that decision. Let Unreal work on the engine while they focus on making a good game.
                So Witcher 1 remake will be on UE5? Hot damn.
                Thanks for letting me know. Great news. CDPR being massive means Epic will likely go the extra mile, too, to help brand recognition.
            That is exactly what they are doing. The Witcher 4 is using it, and is being developed right now
I mean, they have RedMod

https://www.gog.com/game/cyberpunk_2077_redmod
    If you think Redmod is user friendly for New - Mid/Experienced modders you're out of your damn mind. I've made mods for Bethesda games for 20 years. I've spent quite sometime looking at my options for making gameplay / immersion related mods for Cyberpunk 2077 and come to the conclusion that it's just not worth the amount of effort it'd take.

It is pain stakingly obvious if you even take a glimpse at NexusMods for Cyberpunk 2077 that the amount of Gameplay / Immersion / New Quests / New Weapons / New Location / Animation / Bug Fixes mods are absolutely miniscule compared to just Cosmetic clothing and photo mode mods. Add that to a pie chart and compare it to any bethesda release with a CK / XEdit attached to it.

We need something in the form of XEdit and even 1/4th of what Creation Kit offers for 2077 but I just don't think that's going to happen. I don't think CDPR cares THAT much about the mod scene to pull enough budget to make that happen for longevity. There are many engine and design choices that most likely also hold this back from being a possibility as well. It's great for a first step but since CDPR had prior experience with mod tools I was hoping that eventually we'd have modding tools that were way more **user friendly** by now.
        >We need something in the form of XEdit and even 1/4th of what Creation Kit offers for 2077 but I just don't think that's going to happen. I

Yep.  I'm an utter numpty and I was able to make FO4 mods with CK and xedit after watching a few short videos.  They are very approachable and powerful tools.
    That's not enough. We need RedKit, [which was released in the past for TW2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVcMiSIopsw).
    Map editor would rock. We should fill all the buildings with stuff.
        Some modders are already trying to do that. Like the Megabuilding projects mods.
        AMM on Nexus disguises itself as a simple photo-mode enhancer but actually lets you spawn [i believe permanent] objects into the game world, as well as NPCs you can path-animate.
            Not quite what i'm after. I'd like new interior spaces in buildings that currently don't even have functional doors or windows and later on those spaces could be filled with people, companies, quests etc.
    Redmod is a rebrand of wolvenkit which is the community made modding tools for TW3 and 2077. So yep, it’s quite bad as CDPR hired modders instead of doing what they did with TW2 and promised for TW3 (but never delivered), redkit.
        It's still more than we get for almost any AAA game. But I also don't care enough to like argue about it; mods currently do what I need them to do.
            Still, we don’t really get anything more than other AAA games modding. Redmod is just shit for an official modding tool.
They probably shouldnt do this lest they send a message to their executive board who thinks its a smart idea to finish half baked games to just be fixed with mods like Bethesda is doing it seems.
No, let them fix their own bugs and imperfections
    Why not both? (also there aren't going to be any more major patches, so they won't)
        We don't need another Bethesda
            Actually, I think we could use more devs who are as open to modding as Bethesda. Modders can do thinks professional devs don't really have space to, from niche pet projects to potentially controversial options that many would be asking for a toggle to turn off. 

Bethesda modding is not just bug fixes, and many (of my favourite) mods are things Bethesda would've never implemented. 

Having a game with focused vision as a baseline that devs provide full toolkit for so players can add or remove features as it fits them could make for a perfect game.

People say that not every game has to be for everyone... but with wide embrace of modding, they could be.
Ah yes perfect solution to start releasing 3/4 of a game.
Me too one of the biggests dissapointments i had from the game is that they promised a more vertical oriented game, that while the map wasnt more bigger than the Witcher 3 everything was going to be more vertical visiting interiors like Judge dredd megacity blocks, highlines and buildings to explore with content on them, instead except for some scripted events everything is locked at ground level or a third outmost, hope if there is a second game they focus on that.
    Sounds like Dogtown is supposed to be exactly what you're describing. So we should get a pretty good idea of what CDPR is capable of for their next Cyberpunk title.
    Yeah the main issues with the game won’t be solved by fixing bugs
In my opinion, the game has good amount of weapons and it seems to me that no game has good NPC AI (I have never seen someone saying a game has good enemy AI, it's always mentioned to state that it is bad). Before cyberware physically alters the character, I think it should alter gameplay first including the UI (Nier Automata approach).  
I hope Nivalis comes out good and a sequel to Cyberpunk takes inspiration from that. Night City was and still is dead inside with only a select activities to do. I can't believe they changed the game so much and still I am stuffing bottles of alcohol into my pockets for some reason. I can't believe that whenever I go to a bar or a restaurant, there is a dubbed character behind the stall that opens menu and that's all.
    The Halo games under Bungie definitely received well deserved praise for their enemy AI, as did TLoU 2 and P1 Remake. Halo CE was revolutionary in that regard and still receives high praise to this day for what it accomplished. There are plenty of other examples I can't be bothered to list right now. As for NPCs, any improvements would be welcome, they still pale in comparison to GTA V NPCs for example, and that's a game from 2013.

I agree that cyberware should improve in more ways than just altering physical appearances, that's just what I'm more focused on I guess. Seeing the way every character in the series other than V gets chromed out due to their implants was always a letdown.
    > (I have never seen someone saying a game has good enemy AI, it's always mentioned to state that it is bad

Have you played Halo? Those games are practically the gold standard for enemy AI. They are smart and tactical, care about their own lives (unless it’s an enemy that explicitly shouldn’t, like aliens going berserk or trying to suicide bomb you), work in groups, maintain pressure on the player, etc. Really highly recommend the Bungie games.

FEAR is famous for having very intelligent, tactical enemy AI. It’s on par with Halo, in my opinion. 

Hitman and Metal Gear Solid V are also really good ones.
        >FEAR is famous for having very intelligent, tactical enemy AI. It’s on par with Halo, in my opinion. 

FEAR did an excellent job of making it seem like they were far smarter than they were as well. Their call-outs being so specific to what you were doing and their ability to spot your flashlight made them feel like a real threat. 

Overall terrific game and it's a shame the sequels never could reach the same height.
        FEAR also had the benefit of tuning the AI specifically to interact the level design. This combination made them seem way more intelligent than they were.

Halo is an interesting one because Bungie originally was making Halo as an RTS when they switched to a shooter. So the enemy AI is using RTS in combination with really reactive behaviors specific to their species and rank.
        I never played Halo but I remember FEAR having good AI. I never thought Hitman and MGSV AI as good though. Bad AI thing seems coming up more and more nowadays. I kind of don't understand it because even on Youtube there are people developing AI models to play games efficiently. In the age they should have advanded AI instead of basic min-max strategies, we seem to see more and more games with bad AI though. (I assume the Halo with good AI is also old too, like I said never played)
        All good callouts. I remember the AI in Red Faction: Guerilla being pretty damn good too. Maybe not on par with Halo or FEAR, but considering they had to deal with almost everything in the world being destructible, it was pretty impressive. I never saw them bug out and they would make interesting tactical choices that made them pretty difficult.
        I've heard as well that STALKER accidentally made really effective enemy AI just by programming it to find cover and flank or something.
    STALKER has great NPC AI. It's also ukrainian slav magic 9000 on X-Ray engine, made in the 2000s. But they live on their own, follow missions, fight other NPCs dynamically, pick up items that actually appear into their inventory, etc...

I completely agree on the lack on interactibility of the game. You just have the core gameplay loop of combat encounters, sometimes with story elements. But nothing else. The game world doesn't react to what you do either. It feels lifeless.

I really liked Yakuza on that aspect. You go karaoke, play golf, fish, drink at bars, everything has cutscenes or minigames, everything has a substory (usually funny or with a moral behind it). Every street has different, recognisable shops and light signs, or greeter NPCs.

It would be a time drain to do it as well on the huge map of Night City. And I honestly believe it's size is part of the game's problems. They should have made it smaller, more dense and packed.
        After playing 2.0 couple of hours, I was just looking for Yakuza games to play before reading your comment.
Oh for sure. I'm just wondering how much work some of these fixes will require. CP2077 has been a weird project for them.
I wouldn't call that misleading. I'd call that weird AI still. I'd expect them to stop and yell at me for blocking their path.

console, ps5. hence why I said a FOV slider
100% Why bother with an in-depth character creator and tons of clothing choices when we never see our character except in photo mode or in mirrors. I don't buy the "it's fur da immershen!" excuse either. I think it was one more thing sacrificed to get the game shipped on the timetable they wanted.   


I know some people love first person but just make it switchable like Bethesda does in their games.
    No.

There are times where >!you see yourself to show you're not you anymore!< or >!silver hand in the mirror!< which would have such little impact if it was third person as you can see >!who you are physically.!<
        Small trade off to actually be able to see the character I spent so long designing in the CC and the clothes she is wearing. Also, this is a personal thing but I think melee combat in games works a lot better in 3rd person view. It's hard for it not to look silly in first person.
            > Small trade off 

no wonder stories are becoming milque when something that huge to the story is "a small trade off"
Yeah I noticed this wasn’t the same experience as my own. NPC’s reacted to my grenades and punching them was just like your link.
    OP also used a different grenade than the one they used in the "BEFORE" vid
        That was anti-personnel grenade used in the OP video and I think that's the difference.
        Your point? They should still get out the car and run at the sight of imminent danger.
            My point being that one boom boom grenade can be different that spec ops hight grade grenade of imminent nearby destruction of dealing damage out of nowhere.

Also different NPCs have different reactions to stuff like that.
                Nah bro, it shouldn't matter what kind of grenade it is, the fact to the matter is that is a grenade, something that's dangerous, something they should be programmed to run away from or at least be frightened by despite what type of damage it does.

Don't go this far just to excuse what's obviously an oversight from the devs.
well the delay was only on 1 NPC
    i saw on the stairs one, the second one had a little, and the third one took like a week to realize she was punched in the head
That person’s V is just Saitama
Well... that's interesting. Thanks for the info lol
exactly, so why doesn't CDPR just turn it off
    Maybe it's not as simple as just flipping an off switch?
You can't just keep saying stuff like this for every detail though, at some point you got an unpolished game in your hands and you have to admit it.
    I read an intersting article talking about game developement and the problem how as games get more and more realistic the gamers come to expect even more and how the smallest issues can badly affect the games immersion the more relasitic they become. But at the same time they cant possibly make everything perfect on games that are so large with budget and time restraint considerations.

The underwater elements are a tiny percentage of the overall gameplay. At the end of the day remember its just a game lol.
    You are correct....for things that players sees the most I agree. However underwater swimming shadows...not so much.

Sorry your experience is unpolished but I'm having a blast!
GTA5 I'd much, much less detailed than its predecessor, sadly. So many good things from gta4 was cut
One thing I would like to add to RDR2 and it's physics: it's the first game I ever played where I felt that objects have mass. Like when you hotige someone and put their body on the horse, or when you are in a fistfight or a gunfight. You can feel that the things happening in the world have weight and force like in real life.

I mean a few people here mentioned GTA 4 and how it was ahead of its time. Yes, sure its ragdoll physics is even superior to GTA 5 where the later is much more arcadish, moreover, compared to RDR2, in GTA 4 the objects doesn't feel like they have mass.
Played SR2 in 2020 for the first time and it def holds up well. Its old now, but its a game that was made to be *a game* so it rides a good line between whats realistic to see, and whats fun to play. As a huge fan of the open world crime game genre it was one of the last that I played and it still shot up to my top 5 past tons that came after it.

Their NPCs are some of the best because they have so much variety in what they do and who they are. Old people using walkers, couples doing PDA, pimps actually pimping, college students protesting, etc. And then you go spray shit on a govt building, get hit by a car and fly 200ft and toss people into trash trucks for fun. And the story is still some top tier drama.

I thought SR2 stans were overhyping it for so long but SR2 still stands alone in its genre. One of the only things thats lived up to the hype for me.
    There's just so much weirdly obsessive attention to detail in the world. Something a lot of games don't spend a ton of time on (even the later Saints Row entries) because the assumption is that players don't notice it. And while a player may not explicitly sit there and go "wow look at that old person towing around their oxygen cart" or "wow look at all of the mall goths in the mall" it all adds up to an underlying feeling that the world is real. Which is why despite the dated, stiff animations and graphics, SR2's Stilwater is still one of the best open world cities ever.

I think the key takeaway from SR2 is that the NPCs, even random peds, are *agents* in the world, not just scenery. They may visit a store to do some shopping. They may interrupt your shopping trip by holding the cashier at gunpoint. In shitty parts of town the cashier might fight back. They'll lean up against a wall and have a smoke, start playing a drum kit outside. They'll go to play pool or piano. Hell, they'll even drive drunk. Two peds might intrude on each other's personal space and start fighting. The cops may escalate a situation with a random pedestrian until a full-on riot has started. Gangs get in wars with each other and the cops. You might have an NPC run into the garage and flash you while you're working on your car.

Cyberpunk has added a lot of stuff to this tune between 1.5 and 2.0, and it's certainly welcome, but a lot of it is still powered by scripted events. A few chosen NPCs are spawned to do the thing, and all of the rest of them are glorified scenery with no individual agency. In SR2, the NPCs dynamically interact with each other and with scripted event triggers around the world. Hell, if you leave the game AFK, eventually your player character will start acting as an NPC and seek out the nearest scripted activity until you come back. More than once I came back from a piss break to my player leaning against a wall smoking a cig or playing bouncer outside a club.

Praise aside, though, the game does have a few spots of... questionable mission design. Giving the AI access to heat-seeking missiles may not have been the best idea.
    SR 2 had some amazing details. Last I played I found a house you could enter near the water front that had a random ass cypher battle with beatboxers and all. It was wild and ruined gta5 and following SR games for me entirely
>ah yes, the famously detailed Witcher 3

yes, the famously detailed witcher 3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xT9ZnmA3h0&list=PLMpNwDjXWh0wH-pQvAeulaTXA7\_mgbt8Y
That's the exact same feeling I have toward Witcher 3, I gave this game 2 tries, first I got to like 60-70% of main story and stopped playing for like a year or 2 and came back to finish main story and Heart of Stone but couldn't last more than couple hours in the Blood and Wine, this game is so damn easy, you don't need to use like 90% of the things you have access to, put Quen on and just whirl through, story wise this game is good but that's not the only thing I'm looking for in an RPG
funny thing is that they dont die from 1 hit lol https://imgur.com/a/9pVz6E9
    They made a change that removes NPC 1-hit protection.  Pre-2.0 you could never kill an NPC in a single hit, but now you can if you deal enough damage.
[deleted]
    Pistons for arms and subdermal armor are both things that exist in the world of the game, though. No one gets one-shotted by a low level V, you have to upgrade the character for the effect in the video. That's no different than any other RPG.
https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/16p6ovm/cyberpunk_2077_2020_vs_2023_comparison/k1ptif3/
It's only some situations that your character does knock an npc out immediately with a punch, most of the time they'll fall, get up and run away or fight back, and some npcs even dodge your punch and hit back. You clearly haven't tried punching npcs enough
You can only instant death NPCs in normal combat by commiting your stats and implants to it, though.
It's irritating how some youtubers are pushing this update as being a complete overhaul of the game and everything is fixed.

This game still seems as dead as at launch.There's nothing interactable in the world, only menus and wooden npc.
Like what
    Halfway in the video were mostly bugs
    The game isn't done until they add in the female V from the early trailers as one of the presets.
    Actually look at the vid it highlights the bugs
        I am talking what's 'not acceptable'
Yeah, it depends on what he means by "one mission." Technically, after fighting Smasher, there's still a mission, but it's just an epilogue. I actually stopped playing after beating Smasher because I already knew how the game ended and didn't need to see the epilogue (I could just watch it on Youtube).
I know, I fucked up. Oh well it has its pros and cons I guess.
what a banger of a sentence
how often is that mentioned in this sub lol
What about popping tires while doing a burnout  breaks immersion...... You have any idea how hard it is do that in real life? Why are you doing never ending burnouts in a single player game like 2077 with no audience?
    I don’t understand or respect people that do them in real life with an audience either so hey.
Absolutely factual.
Like police chases....
Agree, like I just want to play pachinko minigame :(

totally not needed for core gameplay though
I want something very silly and simple. I want eating animations.   


The game puts such a focus on food and food vendors and cooking animations, etc. -- I wish the food items weren't just bland consumables in your inventory. I wish you could sit at a food stall and chow down on some noodles.   


It's stupid, I know. But it would make a huge difference to me.
I'm  just talking about burnout popping, I'm happy they added bullet popping.
    Oh mb
By games you mean racing games where it's kind of expected and GTA where it was novelty when people found out about it now nobody really gives a shit.

It's not a big deal at all. It's a deal for like 1% of players lmao.
    It's actually not realistic to pop tires by shooting them because it doesn't happen in real life. The bullet only pass through. It was tested before. 

Only if you overinflate damaged tires they will pop.
Well yeah not saying it's the same primitive weight sensor in 2077 but just saying the idea they stop when the driver gets ejected isn't too far fetched and kinda cool.
Yeah RDR2 also suffered from police spawning
God the police in rdr2 was do bad it stopped me playing it more than the one time. Hijack train, park in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, cops show up before you even rob it, ????. Also getting bounties while wearing masks made 0 sense. Too bad really, because I love that game but that shit is just a deal breaker and knowing Rockstar it'll never get a patch because it's singleplayer
It's not even 'adding' characters to the city. They feel more like a placeholder like; just put them in there for the sake of it. I understand, I'm just baffled by how they changed the genre of this game. It was advertised as one thing then before the release as other.
    >I'm just baffled by how they changed the genre of this game.

Because games aren't finalized until they're released? How is this so hard to understand? There's another commenter in here saying they were "sold" on the game back in 2013 when they saw the initial teaser trailer. SEVEN YEARS before the game released they had formed an idea of what the game was in their head. Then when the game released as something else, it was the developers fault.

Cyberpunk feels *exactly* like The Witcher 2/3 feel. It isn't even a little bit surprising that this is how they made their game.
        > SEVEN YEARS before the game released they had formed an idea of what the game was in their head. Then when the game released as something else, it was the developers fault.

This is such revisionism. The devs spent those 7 years talking about features that would never make it into the game. The hype over this game was absolutely down to what CDPR was telling players it was going to be. Dont pretend this games release wasnt one of the biggest controversy in gaming , its only been 3 years, memory spans arent that short. Well, maybe yours is.
            >The devs spent those 7 years talking about features that would never make it into the game.

Yes, that is literally how game development works. Like how there was a functioning metro system until they play tested it and got negative feedback, so they replaced it with a fast travel system.

>The hype over this game was absolutely down to what CDPR was telling players it was going to be.

But this is on the players, no?  This isn't Sean Murray going on TV saying, "Yes, No Man's Sky will have multiplayer" and then the game releases and it turns out he was lying through his teeth. This is pretty typical, "Here's what we're aiming for." They fell short on some things and changed or improved other things. But at the end of the day it wasn't the next GTA or RDR2, which is what people wanted and expected, so players shit on it.

>Dont pretend this games release wasnt one of the biggest controversy in gaming...

Well sure, but largely because it was a technical disaster for consoles. Not because it was some hollow shell of a game that didn't do what it meant to do. I mean the gameplay loop is essentially the exact same today as it was at launch. There's been no big changes in quests, NCPD scanner events, gigs, hidden gems, life paths, branching quests, romanceable NPCs, etc. All of this released more or less as it was intended to be.

Vehicle combat, updated skill trees, more guns, all of these are cool but don't functionally change what this game is and has always been. People coming in here saying that it still isn't GTA or that *now* the game is playable is so bizarre to me. These people are saying they won't play the game for what the game was meant to be until it becomes what they want it to be. Such entitlement.
                Its funny, people blame the marketing but I've heard people tell me they thought this game was gonna be like the Witcher, Mass Effect, Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, GTA, bioshock, etc.  Which are all very different games. And also it was gonna have the narrative freedom of Disco Elysium! (which disco itself can only do due to the very small scale).

&nbsp;

And for giggles when I asked them where they got this idea most of them linked me back to the same videos that said nothing of the sort.  ALOT of heavy interpretation going on lol
I'm actually wondering if this is a bug because it wasn't like this before 2.0 police scan jobs actually have the cops chase you now too which doesn't seem like it'd be on purpose
    Hopefully it gets sorted
gta vice city was ahead of its time
I don't think the real life police would be happy with you if you randomly involved yourself in their work, even if it's helping them
stop the copium, open world AI is still meh at best.

If someone shoots a cop, but the cop started blasting you as a reaction to that, it means AI is shit and not some mental gymnastics justifying unintended behaviour.
Deus ex human revolution cops blast whoever attacks them and not you by default... its not some revolutionary feature.

Also its not something that ruins the experience, but its still immersion breaking if it happens
i did help out a police officer yesterday after patch, in pacifica i saw police having a shootout with the scavs and i killed the scavs and then the police guy thanked me. so it is there, you might've hit a policeman by ricochet or something
    Yes i think police turn on you if you hurt a civilian. I kinda like it because i cannot just be throwing grenades when a civilian or a hostage is near. I have to pick them apart without hurting innocents or else the police will come after you.
I mean if you walked up to an active police shoot out and started blasting people irl I’m pretty sure the cops would shoot you too lol.
Also Rockstar games have almost no choices in their story, absolutely zero consquences and branching quests, no different approach to solving most quests, the combat system is guns/very simple melee/explosives, absolutely no abilities to deal with and their balance, no items with their stats and balancing, no cyberware, etc. So it's very easy for them to make sure that the world feels alive if all of the stuff above they don't have to do.

People compare CP2077 to GTA V or RDR 2 don't mention the latter games have no skill tree, not even different dialogue choices, no RPG-style loot, no levels, no abilities, no balancing, and so on and so on. It's like Cyberpunk has to be on their level while simultaneously adding a whole layer of games systems that RPGs have.
Imagine Rockstar and CDPR teaming up.

Rockstar focusing on open world.

CDPR focusing on combat.

???

Profit.
    Can't say CDPR does combat particularly well (all the Witcher games are wonky as fuck).
        Still better than shooting/cover gameplay of GTA
RDR2 DEFINITELY has RPG elements on another level compared to past titles. Either way, it doesn’t matter. I just wish CDPR implemented the most basic of fucking features for open world titles that Rockstar has set the standard for. 

It doesn’t need to be a GTA clone. Just fucking implement what is expected of an open world title in 2020. Its infuriating.
For me, what made RDR2 special was the texture.

When you buy things from the store, you walk up to the shelf and grab them. Or thumb through a product catalogue physically placed on the counter.

When you clean your gun, there's an animation. When you eat food, there's an animation. Skin an animal? Animation.

In Cyberpunk, this is silly, I know -- but I want that level of immersion. I want to buy a bowl of noodles from a street vendor, sit down, and eat it... Animations and all.

I just want more texture to the world. It's such a cool setting, and I want to touch it.
    Yeah, I agree with that! There's just so much to it. Everything is made to feel more immersive. They really went as far as possible to remove the "seams" of the game. 

It really is an incredible contribution to gaming. Really takes things to the next level.
The bounty system and the cops sucked so much ass in rdr2 it was embarrassing. The game was fantastic otherwise, though it could use more random events, or a timer that reset them once in a while.
    Yeah, I'll agree with that. The bounty system was probably the biggest flaw. There were times you attracted heat when it just couldn't be possible.
Does RDR 2 have:

* level up system,
* different dialogue choices and consequences,
* crafting,
* rpg-style loot with stats,
* skill tree,
* many abilities,
* character customisation,
* different builds,
* different ways of solving the same quest,
* and more typical RPG elements.

All of that takes so much development time Rockstar Games saves in their games. They just have to make main story for their games, like 15-20 guns, a few melee weapons with 2 attack animations per, and a bunch of explosives. After that they call it a day and just can focus on making open world feel believable. No shit Cyberpunk isn't on their level, the game would take 15 years to make.
RDR2, GTA4 and Watchdogs 2 have some of the best open worlds I've ever played. Not alot of open world games can compare to those 3
Are the Witcher games not considered open world?
    bout to say, witcher 3 is absolutely a version of that open world. just 90% wilderness.
        yea, but also a very limited character powerset, you know one of the few ways geralt can interact with combat and missions.  Cyberpunk has a lot more variety in how you play.   That's always a pain in the ass to design around.
    Only when it fits my narrative
As well as they like spend decade to make one.

GTA 5 Launches: September 17, 2013
I mean RDR2 is kinda an exception because the smoke an mirrors is often replaced with just straight up over the top detail.

Like the railway construction crew that slowly works their way linking two lines, you can watch them cut down trees, hammer in each rail segment. The line actually progresses in real time and eventually it completes. This is almost too much detail. It only makes sense for RDR2 because it ties in so deeply to the themes

Also, before the release of RDR2,  TW3 was kinda the gold standard for flavourful world in games. Farmers farming, dock workers in novigrad carrying cargo, people washing clothes, boatyards making boats. It was all smoke-and-mirrors in the sense that none of those systems would progress if you stopped to look at them but nobody was gonna look at them for that long.

Cyberpunk is step back in this sense, very few of the NPC's are doing anything.
    Red Dead Redemption 2 is probably the greatest open world game (in terms of detail and immersion) ever conceived.
It’s a first iteration on a well-developed concept.  There’s no excuse here.  You gonna stan for Tesla next?
    By a studio that doesn't have Rockstars developers or leads.

Like I wouldn't expect CDPR to make a perfect Mario game out the gate cos they aren't Nintendo.
    That's like saying you should know how to play a sport by reading a book.
    No other game studios did anything remotely closer to Rockstar though. For a first iteration, I would say CDPR did quite well. I was one of the people who was surprised that they were even able to release the game. The make Witcher 1 which is low-production quality passion project. Witcher 2 which cannot even be called an open-world. The Witcher 3 where they build onto the first two games and made something great. And then a first-person action RPG with completely different world and gameplay elements which would definitely be compared to GTA-series. They were crazy even to begin this project.
    > There’s no excuse here.

I dunno, maybe you could point out how Rockstar has thousands of employees, spends half a billion on a game, and is going to go 15 years between GTAV and GTAVI because that's how hard it is to develop a true next gen successor to V?
GTA V added aspects like planning massive heists over the course of several missions and three main, playable protagonists. It was pretty revolutionary for 2013.
You're comparing GTA Online to EA practices. 

That has nothin to do with their ability to build and create a game. Something they are still masters at
    Not really I think RDR2 and GTA 5 has flaws a lot of flaws that some people over look just because its Rockstar. I definitely have no hope for gta 6 seeing that everyone that made the series what it is left the company. It is definitely going to be preachy
        >It is definitely going to be preachy.

They’ve already talked about how it’s no longer going to "punch down" with its humor like their games have in the past. Which is about as lame to hear from Rockstar as it would be to hear from the creators of South Park or something. It has this arrogant "we are going to be better than our predecessors who built it all" air to it.
            But it also insinuates that they are above certain people
 The same people they are supposed to fight for its kinda funny
                Didn’t think about that. That’s a very good and hilarious point.
Define "immersive open world" in your eyes.

To me Night City and its ambience is pretty immersive.
Why are you on a CP2077 reddit if you aren't too fond of the game?

Everyone else is celebrating the game now while you remain bitter.
    It's a good question that these people never tend to answer.
I think Starfield is a great example. It’s missing tons of the “little details” an open world Rockstar game has. And I think most people didn’t expect those in it, but many did for Cyberpunk. I was also comparing people’s expectations of Cyberpunk’s current state still being underwhelming, not launch which was obviously bad.
lol the game is fine

touch grass
Yeah it's odd imo. People bought it in 2020 and a lot of them returned it. They call it the 2.0 update, hoping to get those people back, so comparing 1.0 to 2.0 seems like it makes sense. I never got the feeling that the video was trying to say "look, they only fixed this issue now."
    OP literally states, "It's fixed now," for some issues that have been fixed for over a year.
        It's ok man reading is hard for a lot of us.
Maybe watch the video with the comments before making a fool of yourself? OP definitely tries to make it seem like some things which have been fixed for quite a while were only just now fixed with 2.0.
The one about cops spawning behind you literally hasn't been a thing for years. I get that some of you stepped away from the game due to a bad launch and are just now coming back to it, but stop acting like you know what the state of the game has been these past 3 years.
    This is not about that at all. Just compares launch with 2.0 what else should have compared it to? 1.6 or what? This just shows all the improvement from start, it doesn't matter when it was fixed
    They still teleported in like they were beamed down from the enterprise, just further away.

Or you'd just get drones chasing you.
It was honestly not that bad before Cyberpunk hit the news cycle. Now it's insufferable again.
    The same morons are probably back again.
GTA San Andreas, which came out in 2004, figured out how to do shooting out tires and firing while driving. Yes, most these are basic features.
    Another victim of hasty generalization logical fallacy. Most games don't have this sort of features for a reason. It's not basic at all...
    They are very much not basic features for a game. And they are in the game.

They said basic features were Still missing so I ask again. What basic features.
The vehicle features were in the original ads for the game lol.

These were release features delayed 3 years lmao
    You mean shooting while driving. Because the trailers only showed the scripted car chases which are in the base game.
        Lol no. They showed full vehicle customization and much of the current shit.

Get out of here.

What? Did you not have Google or something? Or were you just trying to demonstrate what looking like an ass was?
That was so they could avoid spoilers and copyright strike anybody that does post spoilers - they gave otherwise full freedom to give opinions / reviews from content creators and journalists and it had an average of like 92/100 so far. I'll be very surprised if it turns out to be bad

The original CP2077 launch also got panned before release by reviewers. The game had average like 65/100 before launch in 2020, except for PC where it had good reviews
The only AI this video had was citizens being punched (didn't show them being shot which they do react differently to) and citizen driving AI which isn't the focus of the game and isn't that much worse than GTA. Also the video handily leaves out the new cop chase AI which is fucking great and brutal to try and escape on higher wanted levels.

So yes, critisizing citizen ai driving or them being punch (like people are going to fucking do that all the time) is 100% nitpicking.
    Played GTA 4 recently, and this is way way way behind that game in open world crown interaction and reaction on foot and for vehicles.  


Of course rockstar are masters of this stuff, and cyberpunk clearly made a decision to not focus on it nearly as much.
Yeah I don't see how it's bad to be nitpicky. I'm seeing people say the same things on the Starfield sub. I absolutely love that game, but there are definitely a few immersion breaking things that I would have liked to see differently.

Like a big gripe of mine in open world games is that NPCs only exclusively talk in things related to the game world. That's why Rockstar is so good at these things. Sometimes you meet characters who have issues that are not directly related to one of the gangs and talk about things that don't have anything to do with the game's lore.

Cyberpunk definitely seems to have fixed some of those things. One of my biggest complaints at launch was how the city just didn't feel lived in and that's definitely been improved.
When are you ever going to park your car in the middle of the sidewalk and then sit there to see how watch pedestrian walk around it? This is something that, if it weren’t for this video, the majority will never think about.
    lol that's just a way to test npc pathfinding my friend

&#x200B;

the pathfinding should be there
        Pedestrians aren’t pathfinding in the same way that other npcs are, they are just walking to walk, they don’t have a destination
        You have no clue how game development works
For every hundred people on Reddit who say this is "important" there are a thousand who don't give a shit or probably don't even know these issues exist.

RDR was an immersive game. So much so that it sacrificed gameplay.  One of its biggest criticisms is that it's slow paced/boring and annoying to play because your character takes 30 seconds to do anything. It was a good game but it was hardly "one of the greatest" give me a break. Way overhyped.
    you're literally the only person i've ever heard say that

&#x200B;

rdr2 is one of the greatest games ever made, and i hate rockstar. and the reception and reaction to all its details when it released proves you wrong entirely.

&#x200B;

what even do you get out of defending mediocrity ?
        It's literally all over Reddit alone if you search for it. 

I'm calling about BS nitpicking. What do you get out of being a negative downer all the time
            hopefully more details in my games and less silly things that break my immersion
        It is a snoozer, that's a pretty common take. Masterfully done and incredibly boring
        RDR2 greatest game ever made? lol. I agree with the other person. The realism makes the game a snooze fest. I get so bored playing it.
            Easily in my top 3 but I love a slow burn. I absolutely loved it. Much more than Cyberpunk that's for sure.
            I've got several friends who can't make it passed 4-5 hours in RDR2 because, "It takes too long to do anything." Some people want to play a video game, not replace their reality.
                Same for me. I enjoy slow pace games like RPGs and turn based. But I don't want to play a game where I have to wait for long animations to complete to do simple task.
        To be honest, the shooting and combat are pretty meh, especially compared to how amazing the rest of the game is.
        Rdr2 is one of the greatest games ever made yes, but it's not perfect and it's most certainly overhyped.
    >For every hundred people on Reddit who say this is "important" there are a thousand who don't give a shit or probably don't even know these issues exist

I'm sure the ratio isn't as skewed as you're making it out to be. You make it sound like only reddit ever takes issue with a game. 

>RDR was an immersive game. So much so that it sacrificed gameplay. One of its biggest criticisms is that it's slow paced/boring and annoying to play because your character takes 30 seconds to do anything. It was a good game but it was hardly "one of the greatest" give me a break. Way overhyped.

Your opinion isn't as widely shared, going off of how well-received that game was. 

I personally like that everything takes time to do. I'm not in a rush. Folks are free to dislike that. Maybe the game wasn't built for them.
        I know what the ratio is because I now the average evergday person who plays video games in their spare time and doesn't browse the internet every other moment. The people who buy these games and buy FIFA and buy microtransactions all the time. They *do not* care about these "immersive" things or these tiny bugs and issues they will most likely never see. 

A game being critically successful doesn't make it the greatest game of all time. Brother rdr2 didn't even win game of the year. Let me reiterate though, I think it's a great game with a great story and I enjoyed it immensely when I played but it is lacklustre when it comes to gameplay, the single most important thing in a game.
            Brother, RDR2 won tons of game of the year awards, just not the one from the game awards. It may not be your personal opinion but it widely regarded as one of the best games of all time. A quick google search will show you that it is indeed, regarded by many, as such.
you almost never see the underwater shadow, though I'm not denying it's ugly as fuck
Underwater (shadow) animation is ultra minor, as you barely ever spend time underwater, not to mention looking for your own shadow there. But NPCs AI was and still will be very noticeable.
    Barely spend time underwater = you don't need to fix it?
        Literally yes. There is a thing called priorities in game dev and that is literally at the bottom of the list for a game that has like three side missions that involve water.
        Basically, it makes it less important than other, bigger issues.

Like Pedestrian AI.
            Yes, but still on the list. A very long list. Even though game is fun and all
The underwater shadow is a very hard thing to fix, V's anim rig is deformed on purpose so that nothing gets in front of the camera, this causes the rig to look janky and shadows are casted the way they are. To change the shadow they either have to use a "proxy" entity and assign that to the player, or change the entire player anim rig.
It was in development for 4/5 years, after blood and wine. Unless you count concept.
I wanted the game to be fixed when I pre-ordered it. Some of these features are basic features that have been in 20+ year old games.
    Okay.

What is your comment going to achieve though. It is a blank, pointless statement.
        Same as you, no?
        People need to leave this poor little studio alone. They’ve been working for YEARS to make a game that works like a AAA game should. It’s crazy how not picky people are being. They need to get past it and leave it be
        Your comments are in the same level slugger
        Not a blank statement. The meaning behind it is that cp owners collected money and the game is still broken 3 years after release which is ridiculous
Cope with what? Why are you even here?
Wouldn't it be crazy if they made the gloves have a little hole for the little wire
    Would raise the poly count on the models, probably tank performance!
        I mean, it'd just be a texture remodel. From what I understand you wouldn't need to change the gloves model, just add a transparent texture where the hole is. Heck, depending on how small of a hole we're talking it wouldn't need transparency.
        Wouldnt be much of an issue considering how various clothes have different poly counts anyways. Plus, it wouldnt be very many polys anyways.
        I legit cannot tell if thats sarcasm or not.
            Yes it was supposed to be..!
                Oooh damn sorry then lmao.

And yeah, a sleek and good one... ppl do be saying stupid shit like that with straight face, seen it multiple times on this sub alone.
    gloves with holes?? nonsense. makes more sense to wear gloves which dissapear in First person view
    My characters are still bald when they drive a vehicle.
[removed]
    More like 28C
I had to headcannon that it was armored because muh immersion. But now the gear doesn't have armor ;_; my poor flapjacks.

All bodies are <fine3 but they can be smaller sometimes, particularly outside of the nubile/bait anime waifus. Grown adults also come in many sizes, and the mid-size V's are just on the larger side [*relative to her frame*]. And they are further enhanced by the way clothing bulks up.

Though the larger V's also have my condolences because they get a pretty bad compression effect on the other side of the scale :p
This guy lores
It is. It's such a small immersion breaker. I understand if they didn't have to time or budget to make deformables, or make 3 models of every top... but then just remove the bust size option.
    They couldn't let guys have dick size without letting the ladies make their boobs bigger, and dick size adjustability was a core design pillar of the game, immutable.
        Jokes aside I was really kind of expecting, not for the sake of obscenity, that if they had cut/uncut, that they would have the bravery to add innies/outies [to put it politely]. I know the snippy isn't a "natural" occurrence, while the other is, but I am all about some body positivity and they shoulda given the femme body the same attention [clothing/modeling].
To be fair, the cars in IV were too wobbly, V they were too sturdy but it wasn't as bad as IV's wobbliness.
    I don't think they were too wobbly
You think GTA IV is underrated?
    He spelled sleeping dog wrong clearly
i wish they would make it so if you die in cyberpunk you die in real life
    okay 👍
r/meatcrayon
    Why in God's name did I click this link...
I'll have to get it; old habits die hard and I fear I'll never learn to respect the vehicles after years of a certain play style lol. I started fresh since I didn't really want to sit and reallocate so many skill points. Just made sense to take the time to learn them over levelling rather than in one go, for me at least.
At least Bethesda doesn't leave console owners hanging. CDPR is very PC-centric so modding for their games only cover (less than) half the fanbase.
    Over half of CP2077 sales were on PC. It was 56% PC, 28% Playstation, and 17% Xbox. Obviously the numbers may have changed since then, but yeah.
At least Bethesda actually made Starfield feel like a fucking game compared to this broken piece of shit at launch.
    Well, Cyberpunk certainly has its own feel these days. It always had, and now very much so, had its own vibe. Now it's just 10x better.
    Cope, Starfield is the same shit as Cyberpunk but its a Bethesda game.
        I take it you played Starfield then? And Cyberpunk at launch? 

Cyberpunk crashed multiple times for me in a 2 hour span, had multiple physics bugs and the very first chase mission broke for me to the point where I had to restart the game for it to work. The game was a clusterfuck, had multiple mechanics that were half assed and overhyped. And I don’t just mean the way the game played, I mean what they actually implemented was executed in a broken state. Combat, police spawning, vehicle mechanics. 

You can criticize Starfield for it’s mechanics. That’s all personal preference. But you seriously can not sit here and say the game was broken on launch. Or that it isn’t at least cohesive. I played the early access and had a couple physics bugs in my 15 hours of playing, but nothing game breaking. Mainly just funny stuff like asteroids or random ships spinning. It was nowhere NEAR the level of mess as Cyberpunk or even Skyrim at launch. You people just find reasons to shit on Bethesda because it’s Bethesda.
[deleted]
    I played Skyrim at launch on the 360 and hard agree. While the main quest went mostly smoothly, the rest of the sidequests were bugged to hell. I remember following [this guide](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Glitches) because some quest rewards were straight up unobtainable because of quest-related bugs.
    I remember coming back to Skyrim years after release and they never fixed things like getting shouted through walls and stuck there, and a damned main quest breaking bug that blocked all progress and you had to start again. And then they just left it. It was appalling, and presumably those bugs are STILL there!!
        [deleted]
            Set aside all of the bad glitches and poor launch, Skyrim is highly anticipated because of its legacy.

The Elder Scrolls Franchise is one of the longest and  pretty well known franchise within the gaming world.


Skyrim really captivated all of its audience because of the seemingly vast world and the immersion of the game also makes it such a memorable game to many others.

I, for one, invested 2 days of just playing Skyrim because the world is interesting and unique. The NPCs have their own routine and not just static A.I who only acts when the player is nearby.

They react to your actions and will confront you.


I mean I can put a bucket on to a trader and steal all of his shit without getting caught. For a 2011 game, that was groundbreaking. Can't do that shit in CP77.

Skyrim is also one of the quotable games as you can say anything an NPC said other gamers would most likely recognise it.
    I got skyrim on release. Got about 70hrs in and somehow over the course of 2, possibly 3 updates, something caused my save file(s) to totally bork. Like just randomly while playing a bunch of textures wouldn't load properly and objects in the environment would just be a flat purple placeholder one and would eventually CTD. 



Then even if you didn't have that going on, it would 100% CTD when trying to enter very specific interior cells. Even if you COC'd in the console there it would crash. One of those was an area required to progress the main story, and even if you tried to just do other random stuff it was getting more and frequent. I was staggering saves but by the time I fully realized how bad of a problem it was I would have had to go way to far back just to test if that would fix it. I had to restart entirely and then didn't have any issues like that since. I remember looking it up back than and wasn't the only one with those same 2 issues.


Nothing like the broken save think, but FO3 and NV, Oblivion, and Morrowind were all "crash at least once every hour or two" experiences even years after release without outside mods. 


CP2077 I played 2 back to back playthroughs of about 100hrs each and I think it CTDed maybe 3 times. Other than quirky glitchy NPC  animations and the like I had no other issues.
        God I wish I had your luck. I ended up crafting and disassembling so much that I hit that weird glitch that completely and irreversibly bricked your save (was patched later, but the save is irreversibly bricked)
    "I was there Gandalf. I was there 3,000 years ago.  I was there the day the strength of Men failed."
    Skyrim on 1st gen ps3's, there was a point where you couldn't go under water without your game crashing instantly. I couldn't play because my most recent saves were me in a cave where the only exit was to swim.  I specifically had to write an email to Bethesda detailing the problem, because they wouldn't patch it.  Cool thing was someone on their team responded to me and their patch a week or two later fixed it.
    Lmao no. 

I played Skyrim on the 360 launch day, and I got to beat the story.

Cyberpunk is not even playable period on PS4 and Xbox One

Stop wearing them rose tinted glasses
    I had the game launch day on 360 and I have zero clue what you're talking about dude.  The only game breaking bug at launch was a PS3 file size issue that caused the save to keep growing until it broke the game.  It was only on the PS3 and was officially patched shortly after.  There were zero mods for us console players back then and it worked fine.  

Taking into account the last Gen versions of 2077, this launch was so much worse.  Anyone that thinks otherwise either didn't play either game at launch, are cherry picking versions they're referring back to, or are completely delusional (yes I know this is the cyberpunk sub so that's a distinct possibility).

As to the updates, you have to remember they *couldn't*, or at least chose not to, patch the game so significantly it broke games on past consoles.  Cyberpunk went the other route (Xbox one and PS4 did not get the 2.0 update because it changed the recommended specs of the game).  There was also the issue of internet bandwidth back then.  Patches weren't nearly as massive as they are now, yet still took forever to download.

Edit - lmao dude gave the most snarky fanboy response and blocked me so I couldn't even reply.  😂  In response to his dumb ass reply though, I also had no issues on Xbox series X aside from blatant missing features meant to be added, but I can objectively view this game as a failed launch overall...
    I don’t know about that. While I was only a teenager when Skyrim came out, I remember it being a really fun experience at launch. I couldn’t even enjoy Cyberpunk at launch, it was seriously rough.
        Skyrim was much more broken than Cyberpunk. PS3 version literally stopped working when your save file got to a certain size. Was literally a myriad of game breaking bugs. Bricked consoles, bricked entire save datas.

It's hilarious anyone thinks cyberpunk was that broken at all, it's not even in my top 10 top game broken releases. Could and should have been better but it ran and didn't brick things, and you could get lucky and have a full play through with no bugs.

Gamers opinions are much stricter on what's acceptable now, but they also forget quickly

It's funny how you Google something like broken game launches and nowhere mentions the fact Battlefield 4 literally wasn't playable for 6 months. That's how you do a broken release, and that wasn't even that long ago!

Sim city, spore, mcc, assassins creed unity, Arkham Knight. Battlefront 2, wwe 2k20. Some truly shitty releases.
            Agreed. imo, the Cyberpunk bugs were never the main issue with this game. Most of its huge problems came from how misleading the marketing was and the insane amount of hype. They sold us on some mythical dream game.  


Compared to good ol' Arkham Knight that literally was unplayable for me on release, Ac Unity with the part of the map my character couldn't walk through... or hell even the recent Jedi Survivor with the choppiest stuttery mess of a game ever.
                Yeah, I can only presume people think cyberpunk was more broken simply because more players played it. For an older head like me I can't get my head around it, it was never that broken
            So the PS3 version was broke, not Skyrim in general.

On PC it was fine at launch.

Much like CP2077, ironically. The console versions had the most issues.

The worst issues with CP2077 at launch were fundamental design and resources.
    A decade and a couple of remasters later, I still didn't get past a game breaking bug. If I recall correctly, the game constantly crashed when trying to take a boat to a location. (Whiterun?)

The only bug I remember from the launch version of CP2077 is still in the 2.0 version. It's Jackie walking straight though a locker in the Sandra Dorsett mission.
    I have played skyrim 1.0 extensively it wasn't that bad
    I’ve played hundreds of hours of Skyrim on pc without ever touching a mod, you’re totally full of shit if you claim that even a majority of people couldn’t beat the game because it was broken
        There were so many bugs like being launched into space and the dragons flying backwards and Pastinak or whatever never landing
        He's not saying it's broken right now but speaking on the initial state. Of course you can beat the game now since the game is 10 years old.
            I bought it launch day on Xbox 360, I remember no issues that were game breaking.  Game crashing occasionally, yes, which were patched out fairly quickly.

The "game breaking bugs" the person was referring to only existed on PS3.  In that respect, 2077 was way worse including the last Gen versions.
                I recall a bug on PC that crashed the game every single time it autosaved. It was bad
                I played on ps3 and never had bugs that stopped my progress or bricked my save.
                https://venturebeat.com/games/technically-disastrous-skyrim-is-bethesdas-most-solid-release-yet/

You realize a bunch of people played 2077 on pc with no issues right, just like people did on Skyrim. PS3 users were the worst effected but they were there for each console 

Just because you were one of the people that didn't have issues doesn't mean that was the reality for everyone. Having a whole current gen console not being able to play a game is pretty bad

Skyrim is notoriously at the top of worst releases ever, I attached another link comparing 2077 to Skyrim and people voted Skyrim being worse and this was in 2020 at the peak of the glitches in cyberpunk

I'll acknowledge that there's a chance that your single experience could be more telling then the masses who experienced both launches. There's a chance they're all misremembering it since it was 10 years ago
                    So every link you posted, in both article and comments specifically mention the PS3 bug I mentioned.  That was that.  Was there a long list of bugs in general?  Yeah, have you seen the length of patches of Baldur's Gate 3?  Patch 1 fixed over 1000 bugs and is probably going to be GOTY.

Cyberpunk had baaaad bugs on multiple systems, and obviously removed intended features at release, across the board, which we're now getting a glimpse of.  It's generally regarded as one of the worst launches ever for a game.

I could keep pulling links but I've got dinner to tend to.
                        Both are regarded as terrible launches, I acknowledged that ps3 was the main culprit so you'd actually engage with what I said but you don't seem to want to do that 

One of the links I mentioned had people talking about issues on Xbox and pc, just because ps3 was the worst doesn't mean there weren't major issues elsewhere. I'm not sure I see your point
        [deleted]
    Skyrim UI is still unplayable, even WITH SkyUI.
    Skyrim bricked my PS3, so yeah.

Edit: PS3 got autocorrected to PS4. Hate that shit.
    Uh, I definitely beat the main quest multiple times without any mods. I didn't play it all the way back at launch though
        [deleted]
            Hell, I couldn't make it to the chopping block in the intro due to the physics engine bugging out at more than 60fps. The carriages just flipped into the sky
                Fallout 4 had an issue at launch on PC where if you were playing at above 100 FPS you could lock the game trying to exit a terminal. I had to replay so much of the game each time it hardlocked and had to start quick-saving before accessing any terminal in case it happened until I found the issue.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3s4y20/psa\_getting\_stuck\_at\_terminals\_here\_is\_a\_fix/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3s4y20/psa_getting_stuck_at_terminals_here_is_a_fix/) 

It had a workaround, but it was pretty dumb issue to have. My monitor has a button to change refresh rate and so I enabled vsync and when entering a terminal I'd set it to 60hz, then readjust it back to 144hz when I'd left the terminal.
            Yep same for me on pc, literally couldn't progress
            I never had that bug but you were on PC, you could have also just phased through the door with TCL.
    >the main quest was literally unbeatable because it was so bugged.

So, you think people on consoles just... couldn't play the game at launch? And people just ignored that?

C'mon, lol

Makes me feel old that it's been so long since Skyrim launched that people will just say whatever about it.
    Yeah, Cyberpunk was *bad* but I lost 2 entire saves to bugs in skyrim.
They're also done with the engine it seems, so they don't really need to be overprotective.
    Hopefully they move to Unreal Engine 5. Should hopefully help them make more stable games.
        Yup, they announced a bit ago they are moving exclusively to UE5. I hear it’s really good so I’m glad they made that decision. Let Unreal work on the engine while they focus on making a good game.
            So Witcher 1 remake will be on UE5? Hot damn.
            Thanks for letting me know. Great news. CDPR being massive means Epic will likely go the extra mile, too, to help brand recognition.
        That is exactly what they are doing. The Witcher 4 is using it, and is being developed right now
If you think Redmod is user friendly for New - Mid/Experienced modders you're out of your damn mind. I've made mods for Bethesda games for 20 years. I've spent quite sometime looking at my options for making gameplay / immersion related mods for Cyberpunk 2077 and come to the conclusion that it's just not worth the amount of effort it'd take.

It is pain stakingly obvious if you even take a glimpse at NexusMods for Cyberpunk 2077 that the amount of Gameplay / Immersion / New Quests / New Weapons / New Location / Animation / Bug Fixes mods are absolutely miniscule compared to just Cosmetic clothing and photo mode mods. Add that to a pie chart and compare it to any bethesda release with a CK / XEdit attached to it.

We need something in the form of XEdit and even 1/4th of what Creation Kit offers for 2077 but I just don't think that's going to happen. I don't think CDPR cares THAT much about the mod scene to pull enough budget to make that happen for longevity. There are many engine and design choices that most likely also hold this back from being a possibility as well. It's great for a first step but since CDPR had prior experience with mod tools I was hoping that eventually we'd have modding tools that were way more **user friendly** by now.
    >We need something in the form of XEdit and even 1/4th of what Creation Kit offers for 2077 but I just don't think that's going to happen. I

Yep.  I'm an utter numpty and I was able to make FO4 mods with CK and xedit after watching a few short videos.  They are very approachable and powerful tools.
That's not enough. We need RedKit, [which was released in the past for TW2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVcMiSIopsw).
Map editor would rock. We should fill all the buildings with stuff.
    Some modders are already trying to do that. Like the Megabuilding projects mods.
    AMM on Nexus disguises itself as a simple photo-mode enhancer but actually lets you spawn [i believe permanent] objects into the game world, as well as NPCs you can path-animate.
        Not quite what i'm after. I'd like new interior spaces in buildings that currently don't even have functional doors or windows and later on those spaces could be filled with people, companies, quests etc.
Redmod is a rebrand of wolvenkit which is the community made modding tools for TW3 and 2077. So yep, it’s quite bad as CDPR hired modders instead of doing what they did with TW2 and promised for TW3 (but never delivered), redkit.
    It's still more than we get for almost any AAA game. But I also don't care enough to like argue about it; mods currently do what I need them to do.
        Still, we don’t really get anything more than other AAA games modding. Redmod is just shit for an official modding tool.
Why not both? (also there aren't going to be any more major patches, so they won't)
    We don't need another Bethesda
        Actually, I think we could use more devs who are as open to modding as Bethesda. Modders can do thinks professional devs don't really have space to, from niche pet projects to potentially controversial options that many would be asking for a toggle to turn off. 

Bethesda modding is not just bug fixes, and many (of my favourite) mods are things Bethesda would've never implemented. 

Having a game with focused vision as a baseline that devs provide full toolkit for so players can add or remove features as it fits them could make for a perfect game.

People say that not every game has to be for everyone... but with wide embrace of modding, they could be.
Sounds like Dogtown is supposed to be exactly what you're describing. So we should get a pretty good idea of what CDPR is capable of for their next Cyberpunk title.
Yeah the main issues with the game won’t be solved by fixing bugs
The Halo games under Bungie definitely received well deserved praise for their enemy AI, as did TLoU 2 and P1 Remake. Halo CE was revolutionary in that regard and still receives high praise to this day for what it accomplished. There are plenty of other examples I can't be bothered to list right now. As for NPCs, any improvements would be welcome, they still pale in comparison to GTA V NPCs for example, and that's a game from 2013.

I agree that cyberware should improve in more ways than just altering physical appearances, that's just what I'm more focused on I guess. Seeing the way every character in the series other than V gets chromed out due to their implants was always a letdown.
> (I have never seen someone saying a game has good enemy AI, it's always mentioned to state that it is bad

Have you played Halo? Those games are practically the gold standard for enemy AI. They are smart and tactical, care about their own lives (unless it’s an enemy that explicitly shouldn’t, like aliens going berserk or trying to suicide bomb you), work in groups, maintain pressure on the player, etc. Really highly recommend the Bungie games.

FEAR is famous for having very intelligent, tactical enemy AI. It’s on par with Halo, in my opinion. 

Hitman and Metal Gear Solid V are also really good ones.
    >FEAR is famous for having very intelligent, tactical enemy AI. It’s on par with Halo, in my opinion. 

FEAR did an excellent job of making it seem like they were far smarter than they were as well. Their call-outs being so specific to what you were doing and their ability to spot your flashlight made them feel like a real threat. 

Overall terrific game and it's a shame the sequels never could reach the same height.
    FEAR also had the benefit of tuning the AI specifically to interact the level design. This combination made them seem way more intelligent than they were.

Halo is an interesting one because Bungie originally was making Halo as an RTS when they switched to a shooter. So the enemy AI is using RTS in combination with really reactive behaviors specific to their species and rank.
    I never played Halo but I remember FEAR having good AI. I never thought Hitman and MGSV AI as good though. Bad AI thing seems coming up more and more nowadays. I kind of don't understand it because even on Youtube there are people developing AI models to play games efficiently. In the age they should have advanded AI instead of basic min-max strategies, we seem to see more and more games with bad AI though. (I assume the Halo with good AI is also old too, like I said never played)
    All good callouts. I remember the AI in Red Faction: Guerilla being pretty damn good too. Maybe not on par with Halo or FEAR, but considering they had to deal with almost everything in the world being destructible, it was pretty impressive. I never saw them bug out and they would make interesting tactical choices that made them pretty difficult.
    I've heard as well that STALKER accidentally made really effective enemy AI just by programming it to find cover and flank or something.
STALKER has great NPC AI. It's also ukrainian slav magic 9000 on X-Ray engine, made in the 2000s. But they live on their own, follow missions, fight other NPCs dynamically, pick up items that actually appear into their inventory, etc...

I completely agree on the lack on interactibility of the game. You just have the core gameplay loop of combat encounters, sometimes with story elements. But nothing else. The game world doesn't react to what you do either. It feels lifeless.

I really liked Yakuza on that aspect. You go karaoke, play golf, fish, drink at bars, everything has cutscenes or minigames, everything has a substory (usually funny or with a moral behind it). Every street has different, recognisable shops and light signs, or greeter NPCs.

It would be a time drain to do it as well on the huge map of Night City. And I honestly believe it's size is part of the game's problems. They should have made it smaller, more dense and packed.
    After playing 2.0 couple of hours, I was just looking for Yakuza games to play before reading your comment.
No.

There are times where >!you see yourself to show you're not you anymore!< or >!silver hand in the mirror!< which would have such little impact if it was third person as you can see >!who you are physically.!<
    Small trade off to actually be able to see the character I spent so long designing in the CC and the clothes she is wearing. Also, this is a personal thing but I think melee combat in games works a lot better in 3rd person view. It's hard for it not to look silly in first person.
        > Small trade off 

no wonder stories are becoming milque when something that huge to the story is "a small trade off"
OP also used a different grenade than the one they used in the "BEFORE" vid
    That was anti-personnel grenade used in the OP video and I think that's the difference.
    Your point? They should still get out the car and run at the sight of imminent danger.
        My point being that one boom boom grenade can be different that spec ops hight grade grenade of imminent nearby destruction of dealing damage out of nowhere.

Also different NPCs have different reactions to stuff like that.
            Nah bro, it shouldn't matter what kind of grenade it is, the fact to the matter is that is a grenade, something that's dangerous, something they should be programmed to run away from or at least be frightened by despite what type of damage it does.

Don't go this far just to excuse what's obviously an oversight from the devs.
i saw on the stairs one, the second one had a little, and the third one took like a week to realize she was punched in the head
Maybe it's not as simple as just flipping an off switch?
I read an intersting article talking about game developement and the problem how as games get more and more realistic the gamers come to expect even more and how the smallest issues can badly affect the games immersion the more relasitic they become. But at the same time they cant possibly make everything perfect on games that are so large with budget and time restraint considerations.

The underwater elements are a tiny percentage of the overall gameplay. At the end of the day remember its just a game lol.
You are correct....for things that players sees the most I agree. However underwater swimming shadows...not so much.

Sorry your experience is unpolished but I'm having a blast!
There's just so much weirdly obsessive attention to detail in the world. Something a lot of games don't spend a ton of time on (even the later Saints Row entries) because the assumption is that players don't notice it. And while a player may not explicitly sit there and go "wow look at that old person towing around their oxygen cart" or "wow look at all of the mall goths in the mall" it all adds up to an underlying feeling that the world is real. Which is why despite the dated, stiff animations and graphics, SR2's Stilwater is still one of the best open world cities ever.

I think the key takeaway from SR2 is that the NPCs, even random peds, are *agents* in the world, not just scenery. They may visit a store to do some shopping. They may interrupt your shopping trip by holding the cashier at gunpoint. In shitty parts of town the cashier might fight back. They'll lean up against a wall and have a smoke, start playing a drum kit outside. They'll go to play pool or piano. Hell, they'll even drive drunk. Two peds might intrude on each other's personal space and start fighting. The cops may escalate a situation with a random pedestrian until a full-on riot has started. Gangs get in wars with each other and the cops. You might have an NPC run into the garage and flash you while you're working on your car.

Cyberpunk has added a lot of stuff to this tune between 1.5 and 2.0, and it's certainly welcome, but a lot of it is still powered by scripted events. A few chosen NPCs are spawned to do the thing, and all of the rest of them are glorified scenery with no individual agency. In SR2, the NPCs dynamically interact with each other and with scripted event triggers around the world. Hell, if you leave the game AFK, eventually your player character will start acting as an NPC and seek out the nearest scripted activity until you come back. More than once I came back from a piss break to my player leaning against a wall smoking a cig or playing bouncer outside a club.

Praise aside, though, the game does have a few spots of... questionable mission design. Giving the AI access to heat-seeking missiles may not have been the best idea.
SR 2 had some amazing details. Last I played I found a house you could enter near the water front that had a random ass cypher battle with beatboxers and all. It was wild and ruined gta5 and following SR games for me entirely
They made a change that removes NPC 1-hit protection.  Pre-2.0 you could never kill an NPC in a single hit, but now you can if you deal enough damage.
Pistons for arms and subdermal armor are both things that exist in the world of the game, though. No one gets one-shotted by a low level V, you have to upgrade the character for the effect in the video. That's no different than any other RPG.
Halfway in the video were mostly bugs
The game isn't done until they add in the female V from the early trailers as one of the presets.
Actually look at the vid it highlights the bugs
    I am talking what's 'not acceptable'
I don’t understand or respect people that do them in real life with an audience either so hey.
Oh mb
It's actually not realistic to pop tires by shooting them because it doesn't happen in real life. The bullet only pass through. It was tested before. 

Only if you overinflate damaged tires they will pop.
>I'm just baffled by how they changed the genre of this game.

Because games aren't finalized until they're released? How is this so hard to understand? There's another commenter in here saying they were "sold" on the game back in 2013 when they saw the initial teaser trailer. SEVEN YEARS before the game released they had formed an idea of what the game was in their head. Then when the game released as something else, it was the developers fault.

Cyberpunk feels *exactly* like The Witcher 2/3 feel. It isn't even a little bit surprising that this is how they made their game.
    > SEVEN YEARS before the game released they had formed an idea of what the game was in their head. Then when the game released as something else, it was the developers fault.

This is such revisionism. The devs spent those 7 years talking about features that would never make it into the game. The hype over this game was absolutely down to what CDPR was telling players it was going to be. Dont pretend this games release wasnt one of the biggest controversy in gaming , its only been 3 years, memory spans arent that short. Well, maybe yours is.
        >The devs spent those 7 years talking about features that would never make it into the game.

Yes, that is literally how game development works. Like how there was a functioning metro system until they play tested it and got negative feedback, so they replaced it with a fast travel system.

>The hype over this game was absolutely down to what CDPR was telling players it was going to be.

But this is on the players, no?  This isn't Sean Murray going on TV saying, "Yes, No Man's Sky will have multiplayer" and then the game releases and it turns out he was lying through his teeth. This is pretty typical, "Here's what we're aiming for." They fell short on some things and changed or improved other things. But at the end of the day it wasn't the next GTA or RDR2, which is what people wanted and expected, so players shit on it.

>Dont pretend this games release wasnt one of the biggest controversy in gaming...

Well sure, but largely because it was a technical disaster for consoles. Not because it was some hollow shell of a game that didn't do what it meant to do. I mean the gameplay loop is essentially the exact same today as it was at launch. There's been no big changes in quests, NCPD scanner events, gigs, hidden gems, life paths, branching quests, romanceable NPCs, etc. All of this released more or less as it was intended to be.

Vehicle combat, updated skill trees, more guns, all of these are cool but don't functionally change what this game is and has always been. People coming in here saying that it still isn't GTA or that *now* the game is playable is so bizarre to me. These people are saying they won't play the game for what the game was meant to be until it becomes what they want it to be. Such entitlement.
            Its funny, people blame the marketing but I've heard people tell me they thought this game was gonna be like the Witcher, Mass Effect, Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, GTA, bioshock, etc.  Which are all very different games. And also it was gonna have the narrative freedom of Disco Elysium! (which disco itself can only do due to the very small scale).

&nbsp;

And for giggles when I asked them where they got this idea most of them linked me back to the same videos that said nothing of the sort.  ALOT of heavy interpretation going on lol
Hopefully it gets sorted
Yes i think police turn on you if you hurt a civilian. I kinda like it because i cannot just be throwing grenades when a civilian or a hostage is near. I have to pick them apart without hurting innocents or else the police will come after you.
Can't say CDPR does combat particularly well (all the Witcher games are wonky as fuck).
    Still better than shooting/cover gameplay of GTA
Yeah, I agree with that! There's just so much to it. Everything is made to feel more immersive. They really went as far as possible to remove the "seams" of the game. 

It really is an incredible contribution to gaming. Really takes things to the next level.
Yeah, I'll agree with that. The bounty system was probably the biggest flaw. There were times you attracted heat when it just couldn't be possible.
bout to say, witcher 3 is absolutely a version of that open world. just 90% wilderness.
    yea, but also a very limited character powerset, you know one of the few ways geralt can interact with combat and missions.  Cyberpunk has a lot more variety in how you play.   That's always a pain in the ass to design around.
Only when it fits my narrative
Red Dead Redemption 2 is probably the greatest open world game (in terms of detail and immersion) ever conceived.
By a studio that doesn't have Rockstars developers or leads.

Like I wouldn't expect CDPR to make a perfect Mario game out the gate cos they aren't Nintendo.
That's like saying you should know how to play a sport by reading a book.
No other game studios did anything remotely closer to Rockstar though. For a first iteration, I would say CDPR did quite well. I was one of the people who was surprised that they were even able to release the game. The make Witcher 1 which is low-production quality passion project. Witcher 2 which cannot even be called an open-world. The Witcher 3 where they build onto the first two games and made something great. And then a first-person action RPG with completely different world and gameplay elements which would definitely be compared to GTA-series. They were crazy even to begin this project.
> There’s no excuse here.

I dunno, maybe you could point out how Rockstar has thousands of employees, spends half a billion on a game, and is going to go 15 years between GTAV and GTAVI because that's how hard it is to develop a true next gen successor to V?
Not really I think RDR2 and GTA 5 has flaws a lot of flaws that some people over look just because its Rockstar. I definitely have no hope for gta 6 seeing that everyone that made the series what it is left the company. It is definitely going to be preachy
    >It is definitely going to be preachy.

They’ve already talked about how it’s no longer going to "punch down" with its humor like their games have in the past. Which is about as lame to hear from Rockstar as it would be to hear from the creators of South Park or something. It has this arrogant "we are going to be better than our predecessors who built it all" air to it.
        But it also insinuates that they are above certain people
 The same people they are supposed to fight for its kinda funny
            Didn’t think about that. That’s a very good and hilarious point.
It's a good question that these people never tend to answer.
OP literally states, "It's fixed now," for some issues that have been fixed for over a year.
    It's ok man reading is hard for a lot of us.
This is not about that at all. Just compares launch with 2.0 what else should have compared it to? 1.6 or what? This just shows all the improvement from start, it doesn't matter when it was fixed
They still teleported in like they were beamed down from the enterprise, just further away.

Or you'd just get drones chasing you.
The same morons are probably back again.
Another victim of hasty generalization logical fallacy. Most games don't have this sort of features for a reason. It's not basic at all...
They are very much not basic features for a game. And they are in the game.

They said basic features were Still missing so I ask again. What basic features.
You mean shooting while driving. Because the trailers only showed the scripted car chases which are in the base game.
    Lol no. They showed full vehicle customization and much of the current shit.

Get out of here.

What? Did you not have Google or something? Or were you just trying to demonstrate what looking like an ass was?
Played GTA 4 recently, and this is way way way behind that game in open world crown interaction and reaction on foot and for vehicles.  


Of course rockstar are masters of this stuff, and cyberpunk clearly made a decision to not focus on it nearly as much.
lol that's just a way to test npc pathfinding my friend

&#x200B;

the pathfinding should be there
    Pedestrians aren’t pathfinding in the same way that other npcs are, they are just walking to walk, they don’t have a destination
    You have no clue how game development works
you're literally the only person i've ever heard say that

&#x200B;

rdr2 is one of the greatest games ever made, and i hate rockstar. and the reception and reaction to all its details when it released proves you wrong entirely.

&#x200B;

what even do you get out of defending mediocrity ?
    It's literally all over Reddit alone if you search for it. 

I'm calling about BS nitpicking. What do you get out of being a negative downer all the time
        hopefully more details in my games and less silly things that break my immersion
    It is a snoozer, that's a pretty common take. Masterfully done and incredibly boring
    RDR2 greatest game ever made? lol. I agree with the other person. The realism makes the game a snooze fest. I get so bored playing it.
        Easily in my top 3 but I love a slow burn. I absolutely loved it. Much more than Cyberpunk that's for sure.
        I've got several friends who can't make it passed 4-5 hours in RDR2 because, "It takes too long to do anything." Some people want to play a video game, not replace their reality.
            Same for me. I enjoy slow pace games like RPGs and turn based. But I don't want to play a game where I have to wait for long animations to complete to do simple task.
    To be honest, the shooting and combat are pretty meh, especially compared to how amazing the rest of the game is.
    Rdr2 is one of the greatest games ever made yes, but it's not perfect and it's most certainly overhyped.
>For every hundred people on Reddit who say this is "important" there are a thousand who don't give a shit or probably don't even know these issues exist

I'm sure the ratio isn't as skewed as you're making it out to be. You make it sound like only reddit ever takes issue with a game. 

>RDR was an immersive game. So much so that it sacrificed gameplay. One of its biggest criticisms is that it's slow paced/boring and annoying to play because your character takes 30 seconds to do anything. It was a good game but it was hardly "one of the greatest" give me a break. Way overhyped.

Your opinion isn't as widely shared, going off of how well-received that game was. 

I personally like that everything takes time to do. I'm not in a rush. Folks are free to dislike that. Maybe the game wasn't built for them.
    I know what the ratio is because I now the average evergday person who plays video games in their spare time and doesn't browse the internet every other moment. The people who buy these games and buy FIFA and buy microtransactions all the time. They *do not* care about these "immersive" things or these tiny bugs and issues they will most likely never see. 

A game being critically successful doesn't make it the greatest game of all time. Brother rdr2 didn't even win game of the year. Let me reiterate though, I think it's a great game with a great story and I enjoyed it immensely when I played but it is lacklustre when it comes to gameplay, the single most important thing in a game.
        Brother, RDR2 won tons of game of the year awards, just not the one from the game awards. It may not be your personal opinion but it widely regarded as one of the best games of all time. A quick google search will show you that it is indeed, regarded by many, as such.
Barely spend time underwater = you don't need to fix it?
    Literally yes. There is a thing called priorities in game dev and that is literally at the bottom of the list for a game that has like three side missions that involve water.
    Basically, it makes it less important than other, bigger issues.

Like Pedestrian AI.
        Yes, but still on the list. A very long list. Even though game is fun and all
Okay.

What is your comment going to achieve though. It is a blank, pointless statement.
    Same as you, no?
    People need to leave this poor little studio alone. They’ve been working for YEARS to make a game that works like a AAA game should. It’s crazy how not picky people are being. They need to get past it and leave it be
    Your comments are in the same level slugger
    Not a blank statement. The meaning behind it is that cp owners collected money and the game is still broken 3 years after release which is ridiculous
Would raise the poly count on the models, probably tank performance!
    I mean, it'd just be a texture remodel. From what I understand you wouldn't need to change the gloves model, just add a transparent texture where the hole is. Heck, depending on how small of a hole we're talking it wouldn't need transparency.
    Wouldnt be much of an issue considering how various clothes have different poly counts anyways. Plus, it wouldnt be very many polys anyways.
    I legit cannot tell if thats sarcasm or not.
        Yes it was supposed to be..!
            Oooh damn sorry then lmao.

And yeah, a sleek and good one... ppl do be saying stupid shit like that with straight face, seen it multiple times on this sub alone.
gloves with holes?? nonsense. makes more sense to wear gloves which dissapear in First person view
My characters are still bald when they drive a vehicle.
More like 28C
They couldn't let guys have dick size without letting the ladies make their boobs bigger, and dick size adjustability was a core design pillar of the game, immutable.
    Jokes aside I was really kind of expecting, not for the sake of obscenity, that if they had cut/uncut, that they would have the bravery to add innies/outies [to put it politely]. I know the snippy isn't a "natural" occurrence, while the other is, but I am all about some body positivity and they shoulda given the femme body the same attention [clothing/modeling].
I don't think they were too wobbly
He spelled sleeping dog wrong clearly
okay 👍
Why in God's name did I click this link...
Over half of CP2077 sales were on PC. It was 56% PC, 28% Playstation, and 17% Xbox. Obviously the numbers may have changed since then, but yeah.
Well, Cyberpunk certainly has its own feel these days. It always had, and now very much so, had its own vibe. Now it's just 10x better.
Cope, Starfield is the same shit as Cyberpunk but its a Bethesda game.
    I take it you played Starfield then? And Cyberpunk at launch? 

Cyberpunk crashed multiple times for me in a 2 hour span, had multiple physics bugs and the very first chase mission broke for me to the point where I had to restart the game for it to work. The game was a clusterfuck, had multiple mechanics that were half assed and overhyped. And I don’t just mean the way the game played, I mean what they actually implemented was executed in a broken state. Combat, police spawning, vehicle mechanics. 

You can criticize Starfield for it’s mechanics. That’s all personal preference. But you seriously can not sit here and say the game was broken on launch. Or that it isn’t at least cohesive. I played the early access and had a couple physics bugs in my 15 hours of playing, but nothing game breaking. Mainly just funny stuff like asteroids or random ships spinning. It was nowhere NEAR the level of mess as Cyberpunk or even Skyrim at launch. You people just find reasons to shit on Bethesda because it’s Bethesda.
I played Skyrim at launch on the 360 and hard agree. While the main quest went mostly smoothly, the rest of the sidequests were bugged to hell. I remember following [this guide](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Glitches) because some quest rewards were straight up unobtainable because of quest-related bugs.
I remember coming back to Skyrim years after release and they never fixed things like getting shouted through walls and stuck there, and a damned main quest breaking bug that blocked all progress and you had to start again. And then they just left it. It was appalling, and presumably those bugs are STILL there!!
    [deleted]
        Set aside all of the bad glitches and poor launch, Skyrim is highly anticipated because of its legacy.

The Elder Scrolls Franchise is one of the longest and  pretty well known franchise within the gaming world.


Skyrim really captivated all of its audience because of the seemingly vast world and the immersion of the game also makes it such a memorable game to many others.

I, for one, invested 2 days of just playing Skyrim because the world is interesting and unique. The NPCs have their own routine and not just static A.I who only acts when the player is nearby.

They react to your actions and will confront you.


I mean I can put a bucket on to a trader and steal all of his shit without getting caught. For a 2011 game, that was groundbreaking. Can't do that shit in CP77.

Skyrim is also one of the quotable games as you can say anything an NPC said other gamers would most likely recognise it.
I got skyrim on release. Got about 70hrs in and somehow over the course of 2, possibly 3 updates, something caused my save file(s) to totally bork. Like just randomly while playing a bunch of textures wouldn't load properly and objects in the environment would just be a flat purple placeholder one and would eventually CTD. 



Then even if you didn't have that going on, it would 100% CTD when trying to enter very specific interior cells. Even if you COC'd in the console there it would crash. One of those was an area required to progress the main story, and even if you tried to just do other random stuff it was getting more and frequent. I was staggering saves but by the time I fully realized how bad of a problem it was I would have had to go way to far back just to test if that would fix it. I had to restart entirely and then didn't have any issues like that since. I remember looking it up back than and wasn't the only one with those same 2 issues.


Nothing like the broken save think, but FO3 and NV, Oblivion, and Morrowind were all "crash at least once every hour or two" experiences even years after release without outside mods. 


CP2077 I played 2 back to back playthroughs of about 100hrs each and I think it CTDed maybe 3 times. Other than quirky glitchy NPC  animations and the like I had no other issues.
    God I wish I had your luck. I ended up crafting and disassembling so much that I hit that weird glitch that completely and irreversibly bricked your save (was patched later, but the save is irreversibly bricked)
"I was there Gandalf. I was there 3,000 years ago.  I was there the day the strength of Men failed."
Skyrim on 1st gen ps3's, there was a point where you couldn't go under water without your game crashing instantly. I couldn't play because my most recent saves were me in a cave where the only exit was to swim.  I specifically had to write an email to Bethesda detailing the problem, because they wouldn't patch it.  Cool thing was someone on their team responded to me and their patch a week or two later fixed it.
Lmao no. 

I played Skyrim on the 360 launch day, and I got to beat the story.

Cyberpunk is not even playable period on PS4 and Xbox One

Stop wearing them rose tinted glasses
I had the game launch day on 360 and I have zero clue what you're talking about dude.  The only game breaking bug at launch was a PS3 file size issue that caused the save to keep growing until it broke the game.  It was only on the PS3 and was officially patched shortly after.  There were zero mods for us console players back then and it worked fine.  

Taking into account the last Gen versions of 2077, this launch was so much worse.  Anyone that thinks otherwise either didn't play either game at launch, are cherry picking versions they're referring back to, or are completely delusional (yes I know this is the cyberpunk sub so that's a distinct possibility).

As to the updates, you have to remember they *couldn't*, or at least chose not to, patch the game so significantly it broke games on past consoles.  Cyberpunk went the other route (Xbox one and PS4 did not get the 2.0 update because it changed the recommended specs of the game).  There was also the issue of internet bandwidth back then.  Patches weren't nearly as massive as they are now, yet still took forever to download.

Edit - lmao dude gave the most snarky fanboy response and blocked me so I couldn't even reply.  😂  In response to his dumb ass reply though, I also had no issues on Xbox series X aside from blatant missing features meant to be added, but I can objectively view this game as a failed launch overall...
I don’t know about that. While I was only a teenager when Skyrim came out, I remember it being a really fun experience at launch. I couldn’t even enjoy Cyberpunk at launch, it was seriously rough.
    Skyrim was much more broken than Cyberpunk. PS3 version literally stopped working when your save file got to a certain size. Was literally a myriad of game breaking bugs. Bricked consoles, bricked entire save datas.

It's hilarious anyone thinks cyberpunk was that broken at all, it's not even in my top 10 top game broken releases. Could and should have been better but it ran and didn't brick things, and you could get lucky and have a full play through with no bugs.

Gamers opinions are much stricter on what's acceptable now, but they also forget quickly

It's funny how you Google something like broken game launches and nowhere mentions the fact Battlefield 4 literally wasn't playable for 6 months. That's how you do a broken release, and that wasn't even that long ago!

Sim city, spore, mcc, assassins creed unity, Arkham Knight. Battlefront 2, wwe 2k20. Some truly shitty releases.
        Agreed. imo, the Cyberpunk bugs were never the main issue with this game. Most of its huge problems came from how misleading the marketing was and the insane amount of hype. They sold us on some mythical dream game.  


Compared to good ol' Arkham Knight that literally was unplayable for me on release, Ac Unity with the part of the map my character couldn't walk through... or hell even the recent Jedi Survivor with the choppiest stuttery mess of a game ever.
            Yeah, I can only presume people think cyberpunk was more broken simply because more players played it. For an older head like me I can't get my head around it, it was never that broken
        So the PS3 version was broke, not Skyrim in general.

On PC it was fine at launch.

Much like CP2077, ironically. The console versions had the most issues.

The worst issues with CP2077 at launch were fundamental design and resources.
A decade and a couple of remasters later, I still didn't get past a game breaking bug. If I recall correctly, the game constantly crashed when trying to take a boat to a location. (Whiterun?)

The only bug I remember from the launch version of CP2077 is still in the 2.0 version. It's Jackie walking straight though a locker in the Sandra Dorsett mission.
I have played skyrim 1.0 extensively it wasn't that bad
I’ve played hundreds of hours of Skyrim on pc without ever touching a mod, you’re totally full of shit if you claim that even a majority of people couldn’t beat the game because it was broken
    There were so many bugs like being launched into space and the dragons flying backwards and Pastinak or whatever never landing
    He's not saying it's broken right now but speaking on the initial state. Of course you can beat the game now since the game is 10 years old.
        I bought it launch day on Xbox 360, I remember no issues that were game breaking.  Game crashing occasionally, yes, which were patched out fairly quickly.

The "game breaking bugs" the person was referring to only existed on PS3.  In that respect, 2077 was way worse including the last Gen versions.
            I recall a bug on PC that crashed the game every single time it autosaved. It was bad
            I played on ps3 and never had bugs that stopped my progress or bricked my save.
            https://venturebeat.com/games/technically-disastrous-skyrim-is-bethesdas-most-solid-release-yet/

You realize a bunch of people played 2077 on pc with no issues right, just like people did on Skyrim. PS3 users were the worst effected but they were there for each console 

Just because you were one of the people that didn't have issues doesn't mean that was the reality for everyone. Having a whole current gen console not being able to play a game is pretty bad 

https://www.neogaf.com/threads/skyrim-vs-cyberpunk-2077-which-game-was-more-buggy-at-release-vote-inside.1581929/

Skyrim is notoriously at the top of worst releases ever, I attached another link comparing 2077 to Skyrim and people voted Skyrim being worse and this was in 2020 at the peak of the glitches in cyberpunk

https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/10-games-that-were-broken-at-launch.htm#pt1


I'll acknowledge that there's a chance that your single experience could be more telling then the masses who experienced both launches. There's a chance they're all misremembering it since it was 10 years ago
                So every link you posted, in both article and comments specifically mention the PS3 bug I mentioned.  That was that.  Was there a long list of bugs in general?  Yeah, have you seen the length of patches of Baldur's Gate 3?  Patch 1 fixed over 1000 bugs and is probably going to be GOTY.

Cyberpunk had baaaad bugs on multiple systems, and obviously removed intended features at release, across the board, which we're now getting a glimpse of.  It's generally regarded as one of the worst launches ever for a game.

I could keep pulling links but I've got dinner to tend to.
                    Both are regarded as terrible launches, I acknowledged that ps3 was the main culprit so you'd actually engage with what I said but you don't seem to want to do that 

One of the links I mentioned had people talking about issues on Xbox and pc, just because ps3 was the worst doesn't mean there weren't major issues elsewhere. I'm not sure I see your point
    [deleted]
Skyrim UI is still unplayable, even WITH SkyUI.
Skyrim bricked my PS3, so yeah.

Edit: PS3 got autocorrected to PS4. Hate that shit.
Uh, I definitely beat the main quest multiple times without any mods. I didn't play it all the way back at launch though
    [deleted]
        Hell, I couldn't make it to the chopping block in the intro due to the physics engine bugging out at more than 60fps. The carriages just flipped into the sky
            Fallout 4 had an issue at launch on PC where if you were playing at above 100 FPS you could lock the game trying to exit a terminal. I had to replay so much of the game each time it hardlocked and had to start quick-saving before accessing any terminal in case it happened until I found the issue.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3s4y20/psa\_getting\_stuck\_at\_terminals\_here\_is\_a\_fix/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3s4y20/psa_getting_stuck_at_terminals_here_is_a_fix/) 

It had a workaround, but it was pretty dumb issue to have. My monitor has a button to change refresh rate and so I enabled vsync and when entering a terminal I'd set it to 60hz, then readjust it back to 144hz when I'd left the terminal.
        Yep same for me on pc, literally couldn't progress
        I never had that bug but you were on PC, you could have also just phased through the door with TCL.
>the main quest was literally unbeatable because it was so bugged.

So, you think people on consoles just... couldn't play the game at launch? And people just ignored that?

C'mon, lol

Makes me feel old that it's been so long since Skyrim launched that people will just say whatever about it.
Yeah, Cyberpunk was *bad* but I lost 2 entire saves to bugs in skyrim.
Hopefully they move to Unreal Engine 5. Should hopefully help them make more stable games.
    Yup, they announced a bit ago they are moving exclusively to UE5. I hear it’s really good so I’m glad they made that decision. Let Unreal work on the engine while they focus on making a good game.
        So Witcher 1 remake will be on UE5? Hot damn.
        Thanks for letting me know. Great news. CDPR being massive means Epic will likely go the extra mile, too, to help brand recognition.
    That is exactly what they are doing. The Witcher 4 is using it, and is being developed right now
>We need something in the form of XEdit and even 1/4th of what Creation Kit offers for 2077 but I just don't think that's going to happen. I

Yep.  I'm an utter numpty and I was able to make FO4 mods with CK and xedit after watching a few short videos.  They are very approachable and powerful tools.
Some modders are already trying to do that. Like the Megabuilding projects mods.
AMM on Nexus disguises itself as a simple photo-mode enhancer but actually lets you spawn [i believe permanent] objects into the game world, as well as NPCs you can path-animate.
    Not quite what i'm after. I'd like new interior spaces in buildings that currently don't even have functional doors or windows and later on those spaces could be filled with people, companies, quests etc.
It's still more than we get for almost any AAA game. But I also don't care enough to like argue about it; mods currently do what I need them to do.
    Still, we don’t really get anything more than other AAA games modding. Redmod is just shit for an official modding tool.
We don't need another Bethesda
    Actually, I think we could use more devs who are as open to modding as Bethesda. Modders can do thinks professional devs don't really have space to, from niche pet projects to potentially controversial options that many would be asking for a toggle to turn off. 

Bethesda modding is not just bug fixes, and many (of my favourite) mods are things Bethesda would've never implemented. 

Having a game with focused vision as a baseline that devs provide full toolkit for so players can add or remove features as it fits them could make for a perfect game.

People say that not every game has to be for everyone... but with wide embrace of modding, they could be.
>FEAR is famous for having very intelligent, tactical enemy AI. It’s on par with Halo, in my opinion. 

FEAR did an excellent job of making it seem like they were far smarter than they were as well. Their call-outs being so specific to what you were doing and their ability to spot your flashlight made them feel like a real threat. 

Overall terrific game and it's a shame the sequels never could reach the same height.
FEAR also had the benefit of tuning the AI specifically to interact the level design. This combination made them seem way more intelligent than they were.

Halo is an interesting one because Bungie originally was making Halo as an RTS when they switched to a shooter. So the enemy AI is using RTS in combination with really reactive behaviors specific to their species and rank.
I never played Halo but I remember FEAR having good AI. I never thought Hitman and MGSV AI as good though. Bad AI thing seems coming up more and more nowadays. I kind of don't understand it because even on Youtube there are people developing AI models to play games efficiently. In the age they should have advanded AI instead of basic min-max strategies, we seem to see more and more games with bad AI though. (I assume the Halo with good AI is also old too, like I said never played)
All good callouts. I remember the AI in Red Faction: Guerilla being pretty damn good too. Maybe not on par with Halo or FEAR, but considering they had to deal with almost everything in the world being destructible, it was pretty impressive. I never saw them bug out and they would make interesting tactical choices that made them pretty difficult.
I've heard as well that STALKER accidentally made really effective enemy AI just by programming it to find cover and flank or something.
After playing 2.0 couple of hours, I was just looking for Yakuza games to play before reading your comment.
Small trade off to actually be able to see the character I spent so long designing in the CC and the clothes she is wearing. Also, this is a personal thing but I think melee combat in games works a lot better in 3rd person view. It's hard for it not to look silly in first person.
    > Small trade off 

no wonder stories are becoming milque when something that huge to the story is "a small trade off"
That was anti-personnel grenade used in the OP video and I think that's the difference.
Your point? They should still get out the car and run at the sight of imminent danger.
    My point being that one boom boom grenade can be different that spec ops hight grade grenade of imminent nearby destruction of dealing damage out of nowhere.

Also different NPCs have different reactions to stuff like that.
        Nah bro, it shouldn't matter what kind of grenade it is, the fact to the matter is that is a grenade, something that's dangerous, something they should be programmed to run away from or at least be frightened by despite what type of damage it does.

Don't go this far just to excuse what's obviously an oversight from the devs.
I am talking what's 'not acceptable'
> SEVEN YEARS before the game released they had formed an idea of what the game was in their head. Then when the game released as something else, it was the developers fault.

This is such revisionism. The devs spent those 7 years talking about features that would never make it into the game. The hype over this game was absolutely down to what CDPR was telling players it was going to be. Dont pretend this games release wasnt one of the biggest controversy in gaming , its only been 3 years, memory spans arent that short. Well, maybe yours is.
    >The devs spent those 7 years talking about features that would never make it into the game.

Yes, that is literally how game development works. Like how there was a functioning metro system until they play tested it and got negative feedback, so they replaced it with a fast travel system.

>The hype over this game was absolutely down to what CDPR was telling players it was going to be.

But this is on the players, no?  This isn't Sean Murray going on TV saying, "Yes, No Man's Sky will have multiplayer" and then the game releases and it turns out he was lying through his teeth. This is pretty typical, "Here's what we're aiming for." They fell short on some things and changed or improved other things. But at the end of the day it wasn't the next GTA or RDR2, which is what people wanted and expected, so players shit on it.

>Dont pretend this games release wasnt one of the biggest controversy in gaming...

Well sure, but largely because it was a technical disaster for consoles. Not because it was some hollow shell of a game that didn't do what it meant to do. I mean the gameplay loop is essentially the exact same today as it was at launch. There's been no big changes in quests, NCPD scanner events, gigs, hidden gems, life paths, branching quests, romanceable NPCs, etc. All of this released more or less as it was intended to be.

Vehicle combat, updated skill trees, more guns, all of these are cool but don't functionally change what this game is and has always been. People coming in here saying that it still isn't GTA or that *now* the game is playable is so bizarre to me. These people are saying they won't play the game for what the game was meant to be until it becomes what they want it to be. Such entitlement.
        Its funny, people blame the marketing but I've heard people tell me they thought this game was gonna be like the Witcher, Mass Effect, Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, GTA, bioshock, etc.  Which are all very different games. And also it was gonna have the narrative freedom of Disco Elysium! (which disco itself can only do due to the very small scale).

&nbsp;

And for giggles when I asked them where they got this idea most of them linked me back to the same videos that said nothing of the sort.  ALOT of heavy interpretation going on lol
Still better than shooting/cover gameplay of GTA
yea, but also a very limited character powerset, you know one of the few ways geralt can interact with combat and missions.  Cyberpunk has a lot more variety in how you play.   That's always a pain in the ass to design around.
>It is definitely going to be preachy.

They’ve already talked about how it’s no longer going to "punch down" with its humor like their games have in the past. Which is about as lame to hear from Rockstar as it would be to hear from the creators of South Park or something. It has this arrogant "we are going to be better than our predecessors who built it all" air to it.
    But it also insinuates that they are above certain people
 The same people they are supposed to fight for its kinda funny
        Didn’t think about that. That’s a very good and hilarious point.
It's ok man reading is hard for a lot of us.
Lol no. They showed full vehicle customization and much of the current shit.

Get out of here.

What? Did you not have Google or something? Or were you just trying to demonstrate what looking like an ass was?
Pedestrians aren’t pathfinding in the same way that other npcs are, they are just walking to walk, they don’t have a destination
You have no clue how game development works
It's literally all over Reddit alone if you search for it. 

I'm calling about BS nitpicking. What do you get out of being a negative downer all the time
    hopefully more details in my games and less silly things that break my immersion
It is a snoozer, that's a pretty common take. Masterfully done and incredibly boring
RDR2 greatest game ever made? lol. I agree with the other person. The realism makes the game a snooze fest. I get so bored playing it.
    Easily in my top 3 but I love a slow burn. I absolutely loved it. Much more than Cyberpunk that's for sure.
    I've got several friends who can't make it passed 4-5 hours in RDR2 because, "It takes too long to do anything." Some people want to play a video game, not replace their reality.
        Same for me. I enjoy slow pace games like RPGs and turn based. But I don't want to play a game where I have to wait for long animations to complete to do simple task.
To be honest, the shooting and combat are pretty meh, especially compared to how amazing the rest of the game is.
Rdr2 is one of the greatest games ever made yes, but it's not perfect and it's most certainly overhyped.
I know what the ratio is because I now the average evergday person who plays video games in their spare time and doesn't browse the internet every other moment. The people who buy these games and buy FIFA and buy microtransactions all the time. They *do not* care about these "immersive" things or these tiny bugs and issues they will most likely never see. 

A game being critically successful doesn't make it the greatest game of all time. Brother rdr2 didn't even win game of the year. Let me reiterate though, I think it's a great game with a great story and I enjoyed it immensely when I played but it is lacklustre when it comes to gameplay, the single most important thing in a game.
    Brother, RDR2 won tons of game of the year awards, just not the one from the game awards. It may not be your personal opinion but it widely regarded as one of the best games of all time. A quick google search will show you that it is indeed, regarded by many, as such.
Literally yes. There is a thing called priorities in game dev and that is literally at the bottom of the list for a game that has like three side missions that involve water.
Basically, it makes it less important than other, bigger issues.

Like Pedestrian AI.
    Yes, but still on the list. A very long list. Even though game is fun and all
Same as you, no?
People need to leave this poor little studio alone. They’ve been working for YEARS to make a game that works like a AAA game should. It’s crazy how not picky people are being. They need to get past it and leave it be
Your comments are in the same level slugger
Not a blank statement. The meaning behind it is that cp owners collected money and the game is still broken 3 years after release which is ridiculous
I mean, it'd just be a texture remodel. From what I understand you wouldn't need to change the gloves model, just add a transparent texture where the hole is. Heck, depending on how small of a hole we're talking it wouldn't need transparency.
Wouldnt be much of an issue considering how various clothes have different poly counts anyways. Plus, it wouldnt be very many polys anyways.
I legit cannot tell if thats sarcasm or not.
    Yes it was supposed to be..!
        Oooh damn sorry then lmao.

And yeah, a sleek and good one... ppl do be saying stupid shit like that with straight face, seen it multiple times on this sub alone.
Jokes aside I was really kind of expecting, not for the sake of obscenity, that if they had cut/uncut, that they would have the bravery to add innies/outies [to put it politely]. I know the snippy isn't a "natural" occurrence, while the other is, but I am all about some body positivity and they shoulda given the femme body the same attention [clothing/modeling].
I take it you played Starfield then? And Cyberpunk at launch? 

Cyberpunk crashed multiple times for me in a 2 hour span, had multiple physics bugs and the very first chase mission broke for me to the point where I had to restart the game for it to work. The game was a clusterfuck, had multiple mechanics that were half assed and overhyped. And I don’t just mean the way the game played, I mean what they actually implemented was executed in a broken state. Combat, police spawning, vehicle mechanics. 

You can criticize Starfield for it’s mechanics. That’s all personal preference. But you seriously can not sit here and say the game was broken on launch. Or that it isn’t at least cohesive. I played the early access and had a couple physics bugs in my 15 hours of playing, but nothing game breaking. Mainly just funny stuff like asteroids or random ships spinning. It was nowhere NEAR the level of mess as Cyberpunk or even Skyrim at launch. You people just find reasons to shit on Bethesda because it’s Bethesda.

    Set aside all of the bad glitches and poor launch, Skyrim is highly anticipated because of its legacy.

The Elder Scrolls Franchise is one of the longest and  pretty well known franchise within the gaming world.


Skyrim really captivated all of its audience because of the seemingly vast world and the immersion of the game also makes it such a memorable game to many others.

I, for one, invested 2 days of just playing Skyrim because the world is interesting and unique. The NPCs have their own routine and not just static A.I who only acts when the player is nearby.

They react to your actions and will confront you.


I mean I can put a bucket on to a trader and steal all of his shit without getting caught. For a 2011 game, that was groundbreaking. Can't do that shit in CP77.

Skyrim is also one of the quotable games as you can say anything an NPC said other gamers would most likely recognise it.
God I wish I had your luck. I ended up crafting and disassembling so much that I hit that weird glitch that completely and irreversibly bricked your save (was patched later, but the save is irreversibly bricked)
Skyrim was much more broken than Cyberpunk. PS3 version literally stopped working when your save file got to a certain size. Was literally a myriad of game breaking bugs. Bricked consoles, bricked entire save datas.

It's hilarious anyone thinks cyberpunk was that broken at all, it's not even in my top 10 top game broken releases. Could and should have been better but it ran and didn't brick things, and you could get lucky and have a full play through with no bugs.

Gamers opinions are much stricter on what's acceptable now, but they also forget quickly

It's funny how you Google something like broken game launches and nowhere mentions the fact Battlefield 4 literally wasn't playable for 6 months. That's how you do a broken release, and that wasn't even that long ago!

Sim city, spore, mcc, assassins creed unity, Arkham Knight. Battlefront 2, wwe 2k20. Some truly shitty releases.
    Agreed. imo, the Cyberpunk bugs were never the main issue with this game. Most of its huge problems came from how misleading the marketing was and the insane amount of hype. They sold us on some mythical dream game.  


Compared to good ol' Arkham Knight that literally was unplayable for me on release, Ac Unity with the part of the map my character couldn't walk through... or hell even the recent Jedi Survivor with the choppiest stuttery mess of a game ever.
        Yeah, I can only presume people think cyberpunk was more broken simply because more players played it. For an older head like me I can't get my head around it, it was never that broken
    So the PS3 version was broke, not Skyrim in general.

On PC it was fine at launch.

Much like CP2077, ironically. The console versions had the most issues.

The worst issues with CP2077 at launch were fundamental design and resources.
There were so many bugs like being launched into space and the dragons flying backwards and Pastinak or whatever never landing
He's not saying it's broken right now but speaking on the initial state. Of course you can beat the game now since the game is 10 years old.
    I bought it launch day on Xbox 360, I remember no issues that were game breaking.  Game crashing occasionally, yes, which were patched out fairly quickly.

The "game breaking bugs" the person was referring to only existed on PS3.  In that respect, 2077 was way worse including the last Gen versions.
        I recall a bug on PC that crashed the game every single time it autosaved. It was bad
        I played on ps3 and never had bugs that stopped my progress or bricked my save.

You realize a bunch of people played 2077 on pc with no issues right, just like people did on Skyrim. PS3 users were the worst effected but they were there for each console 

Just because you were one of the people that didn't have issues doesn't mean that was the reality for everyone. Having a whole current gen console not being able to play a game is pretty bad

I'll acknowledge that there's a chance that your single experience could be more telling then the masses who experienced both launches. There's a chance they're all misremembering it since it was 10 years ago
            So every link you posted, in both article and comments specifically mention the PS3 bug I mentioned.  That was that.  Was there a long list of bugs in general?  Yeah, have you seen the length of patches of Baldur's Gate 3?  Patch 1 fixed over 1000 bugs and is probably going to be GOTY.

Cyberpunk had baaaad bugs on multiple systems, and obviously removed intended features at release, across the board, which we're now getting a glimpse of.  It's generally regarded as one of the worst launches ever for a game.

    Hell, I couldn't make it to the chopping block in the intro due to the physics engine bugging out at more than 60fps. The carriages just flipped into the sky
        Fallout 4 had an issue at launch on PC where if you were playing at above 100 FPS you could lock the game trying to exit a terminal. I had to replay so much of the game each time it hardlocked and had to start quick-saving before accessing any terminal in case it happened until I found the issue.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3s4y20/psa\_getting\_stuck\_at\_terminals\_here\_is\_a\_fix/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3s4y20/psa_getting_stuck_at_terminals_here_is_a_fix/) 

It had a workaround, but it was pretty dumb issue to have. My monitor has a button to change refresh rate and so I enabled vsync and when entering a terminal I'd set it to 60hz, then readjust it back to 144hz when I'd left the terminal.
    Yep same for me on pc, literally couldn't progress
    I never had that bug but you were on PC, you could have also just phased through the door with TCL.
Yup, they announced a bit ago they are moving exclusively to UE5. I hear it’s really good so I’m glad they made that decision. Let Unreal work on the engine while they focus on making a good game.
    So Witcher 1 remake will be on UE5? Hot damn.
    Thanks for letting me know. Great news. CDPR being massive means Epic will likely go the extra mile, too, to help brand recognition.
That is exactly what they are doing. The Witcher 4 is using it, and is being developed right now
Not quite what i'm after. I'd like new interior spaces in buildings that currently don't even have functional doors or windows and later on those spaces could be filled with people, companies, quests etc.
Still, we don’t really get anything more than other AAA games modding. Redmod is just shit for an official modding tool.
Actually, I think we could use more devs who are as open to modding as Bethesda. Modders can do thinks professional devs don't really have space to, from niche pet projects to potentially controversial options that many would be asking for a toggle to turn off. 

Bethesda modding is not just bug fixes, and many (of my favourite) mods are things Bethesda would've never implemented. 

Having a game with focused vision as a baseline that devs provide full toolkit for so players can add or remove features as it fits them could make for a perfect game.

People say that not every game has to be for everyone... but with wide embrace of modding, they could be.
> Small trade off 

no wonder stories are becoming milque when something that huge to the story is "a small trade off"
My point being that one boom boom grenade can be different that spec ops hight grade grenade of imminent nearby destruction of dealing damage out of nowhere.

Also different NPCs have different reactions to stuff like that.
    Nah bro, it shouldn't matter what kind of grenade it is, the fact to the matter is that is a grenade, something that's dangerous, something they should be programmed to run away from or at least be frightened by despite what type of damage it does.

Don't go this far just to excuse what's obviously an oversight from the devs.
>The devs spent those 7 years talking about features that would never make it into the game.

Yes, that is literally how game development works. Like how there was a functioning metro system until they play tested it and got negative feedback, so they replaced it with a fast travel system.

>The hype over this game was absolutely down to what CDPR was telling players it was going to be.

But this is on the players, no?  This isn't Sean Murray going on TV saying, "Yes, No Man's Sky will have multiplayer" and then the game releases and it turns out he was lying through his teeth. This is pretty typical, "Here's what we're aiming for." They fell short on some things and changed or improved other things. But at the end of the day it wasn't the next GTA or RDR2, which is what people wanted and expected, so players shit on it.

>Dont pretend this games release wasnt one of the biggest controversy in gaming...

Well sure, but largely because it was a technical disaster for consoles. Not because it was some hollow shell of a game that didn't do what it meant to do. I mean the gameplay loop is essentially the exact same today as it was at launch. There's been no big changes in quests, NCPD scanner events, gigs, hidden gems, life paths, branching quests, romanceable NPCs, etc. All of this released more or less as it was intended to be.

Vehicle combat, updated skill trees, more guns, all of these are cool but don't functionally change what this game is and has always been. People coming in here saying that it still isn't GTA or that *now* the game is playable is so bizarre to me. These people are saying they won't play the game for what the game was meant to be until it becomes what they want it to be. Such entitlement.
    Its funny, people blame the marketing but I've heard people tell me they thought this game was gonna be like the Witcher, Mass Effect, Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, GTA, bioshock, etc.  Which are all very different games. And also it was gonna have the narrative freedom of Disco Elysium! (which disco itself can only do due to the very small scale).

&nbsp;

And for giggles when I asked them where they got this idea most of them linked me back to the same videos that said nothing of the sort.  ALOT of heavy interpretation going on lol
But it also insinuates that they are above certain people
 The same people they are supposed to fight for its kinda funny
    Didn’t think about that. That’s a very good and hilarious point.
Is the 'full vehicle customisation' in the room with us right now?

What? Did you not have Google or something? Or were you just trying to demonstrate what looking like an ass was?
hopefully more details in my games and less silly things that break my immersion
Easily in my top 3 but I love a slow burn. I absolutely loved it. Much more than Cyberpunk that's for sure.
I've got several friends who can't make it passed 4-5 hours in RDR2 because, "It takes too long to do anything." Some people want to play a video game, not replace their reality.
    Same for me. I enjoy slow pace games like RPGs and turn based. But I don't want to play a game where I have to wait for long animations to complete to do simple task.
Brother, RDR2 won tons of game of the year awards, just not the one from the game awards. It may not be your personal opinion but it widely regarded as one of the best games of all time. A quick google search will show you that it is indeed, regarded by many, as such.
Yes, but still on the list. A very long list. Even though game is fun and all
Yes it was supposed to be..!
