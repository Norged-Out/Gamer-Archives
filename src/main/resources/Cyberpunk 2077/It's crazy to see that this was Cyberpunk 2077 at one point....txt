[[It's crazy to see that this was Cyberpunk 2077 at one point...]]

    That sound was driving me crazy. I thought it was some sort of nightmare scene.

It looks like a shitty porn game lmao

        Cyberpunk 2069
            I mean; Cyber*Bang* 2069 [almost happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/LowSodiumCyberpunk/comments/vw6z44/cyberbang_2069_update/)…
            nice.
        I guarantee there's a game out there actually called this lol
            *Play this free family porn simulator that will have you cumming in seconds. Fuck your step-sister, fuck your step-mother, get raped by your step-dog with no sign up fees.*
                W-what?

                        💀💀💀
            Yep. that game definitely exists in the Cyberpunk world as well as ours, I bet.

Art imitates life? Life imitates art?
            There's a game on steam called cyberfuck 2069 , it got recommended to me after downloading phantom Liberty dlc 😂😂💀

        low tier ps3 game high tier porn game
    Tbh, I actually thought this was a shitpost using some porn game footage
        Yea, until someone mentioned it being pre alpha from 8-10 years ago, it looked like a heavily modded gta porn clone, plus that dialogue really didn't help. 

Its realistic though, walking around your apartment without a shirt, bothering your neighbour from the patio, and your partner showering naked while brushing their teeth is 10/10 realism.

    "You won't last 30 seconds playing this game"
    Just wait until you get to cock sizes.
    I remember when it first leaked and the hate for the game was in full swing. People kept saying this is what the game should have been. It was so damn stupid.
        Pffffhahaha

Of course they were. Yeah this doesn't look like shit in the slightest lol
        >People kept saying this is what the game should have been

Honestly, I'm expecting the downvotes: It should be.

&#x200B;

Like, the final game is *okay*, but it's **no where** near what they hyped it up to be. This looks more similar to the "we're bringing the TTRPG systems to video games" that they hyped up during the course of development.

&#x200B;

I don't think a playable version of this leaked with the engine source though. So who knows how far along (if anything) it was from what was shown of these developer/alpha builds.
            It's a four minute video of some guy walking around in a room talking to people. You can do that in the game right now.
            based. apparently people here can't tell the difference between a finished game and an obvious build that's barely past pre-production. like all those morons on twitter when the gta6 footage leaked.

    when the game came out back then. I remember seeing a porn game ad It was named: Cyberslut 2069 !
    You know now that you actually mention it Cyberpunk does kinda give off 3D porn vibes😭
    You guys realize every in development game has the fidelity of a shitty porn game?
    This was never cyberpunk, I’ve been playing since release
Glad to see those rubber lined cargo pants made it into the final game. Lol
    Not that chrome on his back tho😭
        It looks too generic tbh. That's probably why. But yes I agree we should have more freedom and control over our cyberware appearance.
            https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4547
                Probably doesn’t even work with the update
                    Mods only got outdated because the big dependency mods all the others plug into were fucked by the patch...for about a week.

Those are updated. Most of the CP2077 mod library works again, plug and play.
                    I'm using it currently works just fine.
            ...Then make some interesting options for your back?
                ... That's literally what they're asking for? What are you trying to say rn
                    They're saying it doesn't exist because it's too generic. Instead we just don't have options? That makes no sense. If the reason is it is too generic, they could just make a design that isn't generic.
                        The one depicted *in this video* is generic, not back cyberware as a whole. Not sure how one could reach that conclusion.
                        Are you doing ok?
                you will literally never see your back
                    I exclusively ride motorcycles, I prob see my back more than I see my face.
                    I literally never see my face, yet there's a lot of facewear/helmets/hats what's your point?
                        Must be hard not using your inventory...
I know this is a proof-of-concept video from over ten years ago, but I can't help but think of early access porn games on steam listening to this lmao.
There’s something charming about this, feels like the early 2000s aesthetic
    yea the feeling i get from watching this is similar to the first witcher game
        I’m going to call this build Cyberpunk 2057
    Reminds me of Mass effect a little bit
        Definitely
        Could you imagine if we got a 3PS cyberpunk like mass effect 👀
            My biggest frustration with the game, it's not that was overselling itself or the many senseless gameplay choices (I love the game tho). It was the lack of 3rd person 
For a role playing game that advertised "be who u wanna be in this fashion crazy looking world", it's stupid to have a 1st person view, so why have a character creator and styles choices?, as is completely irrelevant outside using a bike lol, that's why I think it was a "last minute change" in order to keep up with the stupid deadlines, as is easier to have "most" animations hidden. And that could be ok, but cutscenes are like that too, which furder disconnects u from V, as u no longer see him/her, (in trailers game used to have 3rd person, more cinematic cutscenes, maybe were unfinished too and removed entirely, go watch them again and tell me it's not better). U could argue it's more immersive now, but imo, V it's not a silent protagonist as other games, it has clearly defined personality, just like Gerald in Witcher, so leaves me not feeling like I'm V, but not also fully knowing V, at least phissically, it felts lazy to me to have free camera control in scenes.
3rd person Cyberpunk it's my wettest dream, but it's never going to happen, a 2.0 update with it maybe in the style of RE8 would of been amazing.
                lol… I agree there should’ve been the OPTION of third person, but the first person experience in cyberpunk sets a new standard that I think all FPS games should follow if a first person view is in their game.  I love how well done it is and I can’t imagine taking that away.  Why do we have to have one or the other, how about both?
                    I think 3rd person was always the intend, but 1srt turned out very well at least. Yep, I would kill for the option, and yes, a Bethesda approach where you decide which camera to use is so cool, specifically in a role playing game, "see the world through your protagonist or see how it becomes one"
    I get Knights of the Old Republic vibes
So V used to date Sandra Dorsett? Hmmm....
    I was really surprised that wasn't in the cards in the game. Maybe they felt it was too exploitative?
        Yeah, makes sense. It's kind of weird for someone who experienced severe trauma to fall in love with the guy that rescued them. Feels more like a trauma response than genuine.
            I get that, but they could have made it a long burn romance.  Have more than two missions kinda thing, where she doesn't initially take to you, even for saving her.  

I just wish there were more romance options is all, doesn't even have to be Sandra.
                Homo for Goro for sure
                still no, thats gross.

                        Yeah people need to relax a little... sometimes people fall in love with each other because they are good for one another. It doesn't get more complicated than that.

                                No, I'm pointing out that what you are so worried about is not always the case. I think you just made my point to be honest.

People want to be so afraid it is always happening, they can't relax enough to understand that it is not always happening.
                                What is an inappropriate age gap?

Is 20 years too much? Does that change when it's a woman that's older vs a man? Does the lowest age matter? Like is 18/38 worse than 30/50?

I dated a woman that was 20 years older than me, If anything she was the one that left hurt. She was hot and I was coming out of a shitty relationship and just wanted sex. So am I the abuser? Or her for being "predatory" going after someone 20 years younger. Would the situation be different if I was a woman and it was a man? 

Imbalanced power dynamics.. so one person works at Burger King the other is a DA for the city? If they love each other what's the issue? 

Grooming? Yeah that's clearly wrong. That's someone taking all the things you just mentioned and using it in a manipulative way. Intentions are what matter. Unfortunately bad intentions exist even without anything you mentioned.
            Would she even remember?

To her it would just be some gonk going: "Hey, I remember saving you from some scavs"

"Well, I lost 36 hours back then. Didn't really take in any faces."
    I thought at the start of the second quest involving her that it might go that direction when I first played it
    It wasn't Sandra Dorsett, just some women named Sandra. Sandra Dorsett didn't even have a name when they begin the work on that quest (which happened a long time after this prototype was done), with her being called simply "Kidnapped girl".
        No. It's Sandra Dorsett. They just completey reworked her character for the actual game. Most of the characters were already at least a concept on paper at this point.
            It's not. Even in the game files she initially didn't have a name. Saying that it's Dorsett just because she happens to share a common female name with a women from a several years old prototype is just silly.
                Both versions start with a Sandra. It’s not exactly a leap to connect the two.
Wtf am I hearing in the background?
    Sounds like a repeated loop of someone brushing their teeth
        I'm so glad I wasn't the only hearing that and thinking exactly the same thing.
        I mean it clearly was naked lady in bathroom.
            But the loop happened for the full 4 minutes, even when she was dressed in the living room
                It's just a half assed proof of concept, not finished game)
    [ brushes teeth ]  

what sound?
What most people don't know is there is a playable build of this prototype inside the leaked Witcher 3 source code(it's still encrypted).
    I remember i had the password to it once but i forgot it since it was a while ago but yea this prototype is in it.
        Wouldn't happen to be FF06B5?
        That’s neat. Why was it put in there? Do you know?
            It was originally going to be built in RedEngine 3
    I would unironically enjoy playing this. Think it's still possible?
        Probably if the password was found. There are rumors that some people got in at some point(like the guy commenting earlier claims he did). Most leads I've seen over the past year have gone nowhere. 

Edit: There actually were some assets from this build leftover in the Witcher 3 GOG GOTY edition ver 1.31-1.32. I discovered them last year and was kinda surprised nobody had discovered them back in the day cause people were dying to hear anything about Cyberpunk pre 2018.
            What assets were in the Witcher 3?
                Maybe he meant this https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7050
Is this really some early footage or am I getting bamboozled with some downmodded shit?
    That's a real early version of the game, yes.

It leaked a while ago.
        I doubt it was leaked just now, I saw the screenshots a few years ago. This is probably a version of the game using the Witcher 2 engine or something
            This was leaked with the CP2077 and Witcher source codes shortly after launch
            Nah, it would be branched off from the REDengine version that Witcher 3 used, but it looks like shit since everything is placeholder assets created just to test out the game concept.
                Yeah, it's basically a story board.  Use some cheap ass, super easy to use engine to build out environments to story board.  Even the voice actor is not a voice actor, just someone in the office reading lines.
            Did they edit it? Because the comment just says a while ago, which doesn't necessarily mean recently.
                Sorry, I forgot that "while" can also be used in the context of a longer period of time.>!non-english native moment!<

Sorry for being rude mister baname!

            What is "a while" to you?
                The guy before you really just woke up and decided to argue over the most pointless things.
    Leaked footage from while ago. I think the game was pretty much scraped and build from ground up between this and release.
    Like a beta build if I recall.
        This is more like early Alpha. This was probably around the same time they put out the original announcement teaser.
            Not even Alpha. This is a prototype.
                Not even prototype. This is only a POC
                    Not even a POC, this is just a tribute
                        Nay!  We are but men!
                            #ROCK!
                                AAAAAHHHHHHHH
                        Couldn't remember the POC, this is just a tribute
                    Not even a POC. This is only
                        No this is Patrick
                Not even a prototype, but a video on my phone
            More like pre-alpha prototyping
            Yeah couldn't recall, this seems more like an engine test, seeing how things come together.
                Yeah this seems more like early intern work, seeing how it looks like crap
                    An intern couldn't do all this. It's a prototype. Of course it's going to look like crap. Like, what the fuck are you all complaining about lmao
                        Congrats you got the joke
            more like prototype
        This is not even Pre-Alpha friend. This is a prototyping build. Alpha implies that all features of a game must be functional. This is nowhere near all features.
            thats incorrect. an alpha is when the features and mechanics are being developed. a prototype isnt even at the point where they are for real developing the final mechanics.

Beta is when all features are mostly complete, and production goes from developing to polishing fixing and optomizing.
                definitely a prototype. nobody starts a game off looking like the end product, it's a lot faster to build prototypes to test everything before you start putting effort into it looking like a finished game

edit: you guys are lucky they even bothered to model characters, if this were my game they'd all be capsules with beautiful gradients and shaders because I wasted too much time making my prototype look really nice for what it is even though I'm going to replace everything anyway, but maybe that's all you gamers deserve!
        And even then they had 3rd person smh
            it was running on witcher 3's engine at the time (august 2013) when this prototyope was built, it wasn't possible for FPP because the engine didnt allow it but they always wanted it to be in FPP
    Keep in mind it was first annouced back in 2013 or something.
Can't help but see alpha protocol from this footage lol 

It would have been cool to see what this version would have looked like though somewhat a mashup or Cyberpunk and Mirrors Edge
Guy on the balcony looks like an early Placid model
    i was thinking the exact same thing lol
Every game looks like this in early stages.
    yea i know but it’s interesting to see how the aesthetics kinda went from generic sci fi like maybe mass effect,  to something more like judge dredd’s cyberpunk in the e3 2018 build
        I think you might be mistaking the simple lighting and untextured polygons of a prototype for intentional aesthetics. There are some textures, but most of it seems to be untextured or with very flat textures.

I don't think the aesthetic of 2077 was ever intended to be this clean, light, bright and so on, because the original trailer, 10 years ago, before this even, was much darker and grittier in tone.
            When he goes to look off in the distance, I remembered Keanu saying “the city is breathtaking” lol well it certainly took awhile to get there
            the first ever concept art  was like this and the cyberpunk 2077 we have now back in may 31 2012 when they revealed their new IP
                >the first ever concept art  was like this

No, it wasn't. Unless you're going to link me some concept art I've never seen, it 100% was not.

This isn't from May 2012, this is from August 2013, long after the teaser trailer, which has the same general look as the game we got.

The earliest concept art is this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/97n4o0/first\_ever\_cyberpunk\_2077\_concept\_art\_released/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/97n4o0/first_ever_cyberpunk_2077_concept_art_released/)
                    no shit its from august 2013, im talking about the first concept art that you linked and another one with a giant robot  which was revealed in may 2012 during the summer conference at cdpr which looked colorful like this and in the final game the same colorfullness can be found in many areas like the afterlife which looks exactly the same as that concept art etc.   


and then theres many other concept arts from pre production which are colorful as well https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/albums/2875189
                        The concept art has always been "colourful", sure, including the piece I linked, but that's not "like this" aesthetically.

None of the concept art you've linked looks anything like the extremely bright, zero detail, very white-centric look of this early prototype, which looks like ultra-generic sci-fi or a porn game or something (because it's a prototype, not an intentional aesthetic).

(The most interesting think about that James Daly link is that his stuff looks more similar to Cyberpunk 2020 than what we actually got in the end - it's pretty cool.)
                            Ok what about this concept art which has that bright zero detail white centric look that you talk about [https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq](https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq) plus the 2018 demo also had this type of look.  


not really the concept art on that james created look like what we have in the game [https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/projects/18Wgo2?album\_id=2875189](https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/projects/18Wgo2?album_id=2875189) the second image looks exactly like heywood in the final game same brick buildings, at the bottom you can see those mechanical things that hold buildings which can be found in the game etc.
                                >Ok what about this concept art which has that bright zero detail white centric look that you talk about https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq plus the 2018 demo also had this type of look.

The 2018 demo does not have "that kind of look":

[https://youtu.be/sjH48Xs-5OA?si=jTboZXPxUNpYViYf](https://youtu.be/sjH48Xs-5OA?si=jTboZXPxUNpYViYf)

Honestly what are you talking about? There's no bright white zero detail there?

As for your link, I'd love to go through, but Windows is telling me that is not safe. Hopefully he just needs to update his site certificate or something, but mate, I ain't opening that.
                                    what do u mean theres no bright white zero detail in the demo? go to the part where V takes sandra to trauma team you can see the bright whites and the part where they overlook the city after taking out the scavenger AV you can see the bright white lighting, or when V is walking up the stairs after the corpo meeting to enter her vehicle you can see that the bright white look, looks the same as the prototype. and there wasnt much detail in that demo it looked too clean and flat. also the link i sent is a false positive, its a devs portfolio
                    Can you delete your comment? He was definitely right and you're, well, just wrong.
                        Did you respond on the wrong comment?
                            Lmfao no. u/kmcwwdfwa_fv324 is right. You're technically wrong. "Did I respond to the wrong comment" lmao. Pretty full of yourself aren't you?
        It is just an early prototype. Details are usually intentionally omitted so they can experiment on what direction they want to take.
        Yes that's why art department exists. They give character.
        It really looks like starfield lmao
    Does every game at this stage have recorded actors' voice lines?
        I doubt those were actual actors. Probably just people on the team voiced lines in order to make this little proof of concept demo more interesting for whatever presentation it was intended for.
        v sounded like he was voiced by the programmer..
        If they want to test it as well, of course. 

Why not? 

They can even get actors for motion capture.
            Sure, I mean if it's something common. I don't want to argue or anything.
    no, this is just proof of concept demo. Later on Cyberpunk's dev was handed to a completely different team that worked on The Witcher 3. That was the biggest mistake CDPR ever did. Success of The Witcher 3 gave them delusions of grandeur, so they started smelling their own farts. you can tell by all the "hype" video and all the parties, celebrities, and bullshit claims they in the interviews. it all culminated when they straight up lied to players about the state of PS4 and Xbox One versions (that infamous video where they drove the car around Night City REALLY slow to avoid asset loading bugs), and when they paid journalists to lie about state of the game, because they all gave it 10/10 few days before release before players got hands of it, and these scores were later retracted.
        State of game was fine, if you didn't run it on a patato from 15 years ago. 
Yeah, they made the mistake of letting it start on those systems in the first place.
            I played it on a $4,000 PC at launch and it was decisively not fine lol, it only ran great compared to the last-gen console shitshow.
                I played it on a $500 console at launch and it was very fine.
                    I played it on PC at release and it was fine also
    No shit Sherlock. No one is saying they don’t.
He moves like Geralt nice
    Obviously based on the same animation
they kept the floor tile design for the player home from the very beginning lmao
    It's a reference to the shining
        How do u know?
            By looking at it
Isn't that Geralt's walking animation from the Witcher 2?
The funny thing is that the devs are doing the voice acting themselves.
Cyberpunk. Starring bored Paulie shore and his best friend, looping toothbrush sound!
This the type of porngame that you will find on steam under 3$ bucks lmfao
What's with the aggressive tooth brushing sounds in the background?
The constant brushing of teeth.
It is *hilarious* that videos like this on YouTube always see comments like "Game was way more immersive like this" and "This was so much better than what we got!"

We have a sound loop in the background of someone brushing their teeth, and it sounds like one of the devs standing in as the VA for the protagonist.

"You're a starrr."

*shudders*
Imagine V lying on a bed like a normal person
    They have for  a while now
Ugh I know. That rug is awful.
    I thought it pulled the room together
Im glad they settled on a red color scheme cuz this blue one wasnt it
That’s just cyberpunk on the PlayStation 4
    Nah the PlayStation 4 version was much worse.
Would've been really cool if it ended up being made for 1st and 3rd person
    That’s actually one of the main reasons why I enjoy my motorcycle. One of the few times I get to see my character.
        You can see yourself in the driver's seat if you use the zoomed-out camera on regular cars, too.
        I'm really surprised they haven't added this yet. There's no reason not to at this point
            Remaking tons of animations from first person to fit third person isn't super easy. But yeah I'd also like third person, at least in the sequel game if they can as an option
    but then i also want my witcher3 first Person version xD
    Maybe in the next game since they are switching engines
        It’s not an engine issue it’s clearly a creative choice to stay mostly 1st person
            Mike Pondsmith specifically told them they need to do it in first person.
            It’s an engine issue. They were originally making it to be  3rd person but couldn’t figure out the animations so they had to claim it was not immersive enough.
                But the witcher 3 is in 3rd person and use the same engine.

Its clearly a creative decision
                    The Witcher 3 also doesn’t have you double jumping, dashing through the air, flying to enemies with a melee lock on, and (before it got scrapped) wall running/latching.  The fast moment to moment gameplay with V flying everywhere is what made the 3rd person view hard for them I suppose, although I do wish we could see our character in 3rd person even if it was only outside combat encounters
                        but that's not an engine issue. It is  design decision to NOT make the animations necessary for that perspective.  


there are 3rd person mods that make it possible and you can clearly see the animations were never refined for it.
                        > I do wish we could see our character in 3rd person even if it was only outside combat encounters

That’s one of the reasons why I ride a bike everywhere in this game (the other reason being the superior driving mechanics).
                        Stop being an arm chair dev lol, your claims have no basis in fact.
                            You clearly haven't messed with a late game katana build then because I don't see how any modern game studio could do that kind of combat justice in 3rd person. I don't think you realize how much dev time this would require and how much of our current first person experience would be sacrificed because of it.
                                I'm not saying that it's easy I'm saying he has no claim to what he's saying. What we know is that the devs decided FPP for creative reasons not because they found TPP implementation hard.
                        I don't think you understand what "game engine" means.
                "Couldn't figure out the animations" wtf does that even mean? Why state your uninformed speculation as fact?
                    especially since they literally said 3 months before the initial release date that they decided to switch to 1st person only for artistic choices.

the initial playthrough of the all foods factory mission has 3rd person sections.
                Somehow I don't think you know very much about any game engine
                This is totally wrong.
        Modders did it within days after the game came out, what makes you think 3rd person in a video game is an engine limitation?
            except its buggy
                The whole game is buggy
                    You're missing the point. The point is that 3rd party implementations tend to not be as polished as official ones. So yeah, there is a 3rd person mod, but it's also shitty as hell.
                         No, you’re missing the point. It’s clearly not an engine limitation if third party mods can do it, even with jank.
                            Neither of us are missing the point, because the only point Im making is that janky implementations aren't a good substitute. The only way third person would ever be good is in the sequel, because they could have levels designed for third person, they could make all the dialogue interactions in third person, that's what I mean. It's not enough to just make third person, you also need to accommodate the rest of the game for it.
All a modder does is make third person mod, but they don't change the rest of the game to make it work with third person.


Besides, I don't think CDPR ever mentioned it being an engine limitation anyways, it was a design decision, the same way Dark Souls doesn't have toggleable first-person view with difficulty settings, like could you imagine Dark Souls having an easy mode? Lmao that'd be dumb as hell. This is always the biggest of irony of the game industry. We want developers to do what they want instead of listening shareholders or market studies or whatever but then later we go "no your game NEEDS X features" and we make the biggest fucking noise over it.
                    every game has bugs
        Idk why people keep thinking my comment was about engine limitations. Maybe it’s cause I wasn’t specific. All I said was maybe we’ll have the option for both in the new engine. That’s it, that’s all the comment meant.
            But this is like saying "I hope the actors get to kiss on the DVD release", as if they weren't able to before during filming of a show or movie.
            Yes and people are telling you you’re misguided because the engine has nothing to do with that. If they planned on adding third person they would do it regardless of switching engines or not.
                Y’all are so desperate for conflict. It’s literally just me agreeing with the original guy and saying it would be cool. I only brought up the engine cause the next game is literally on a different engine. No other reason.
                    I think they are just trying to let you know that even on a different engine, it has nothing to do with whether they make it first or third person or both.
So bringing it up was kind of a mute point, it doesn't change their decision or influence it. They purely made it first person only to focus on things like facial animations and close up detail.
It's not supposed to be a conflict, they are just explaining where the thought process doesn't make sense.
            I'd say there are engine limits at play. The game has a huge issue with LOD, pop ins and render distance. 

Definitely not the only factor though
                You’d be wrong. It makes no sense.
looks like a xbox 360 game
    I think this was even before the Xbox one/ps4 Gen so makes sense
    The game was orginally announced at E3 2013 and the One/PS4 were released the November of the same year a few months after. SO yeah, it probably would have been built with that level of asset detail in mind.
    That's really impressive considering most prototypes look like N64 games.
Sad that the final game was an omega downgrade…

I mean I didn’t find any naked girl in my shower during my playthrough ??? CD Projekt cutting some great feature as always T_T
    You got the wrong ending.
    > I mean I didn’t find any naked girl in my shower during my playthrough ???

Have you tried getting different endings as there is absolutely one with exactly this.
        It was more for the meme but i’m actually waiting a bit for after last DLC to play again the game with full mods. So I didn’t know :/

But hey, why do I have to do a whole playthrough to get 1 girl in my shower tho ?
            It's a prize (?)
            Play on PC and spawn as many as you want
    If there's anything that browsing Cyberpunk 2077 Nexus mods taught me, it's that there's a huge demand from horndogs everywhere for lewd content in video games
Looks like a mod for Heavy Rain lmao. Can't believe this is legit
    Why not? This was pre-Xbox one/PS4 era.
I'm honestly so glad they went with 1st person view. This would be so much worse.
From what year is this?
    august 2013
    2012.
This was probably what CDPR had from the first announcement.
    2013 probably since the walking animation is reused from Witcher 2.
    2077
Idk why but the jank movement feels so nostalgic and at home to me. I remember playing games with these feeling back when I was younger
So we had 3rd person in one point, what happened with that?
    The answer they've *repeatedly* given is twofold:

1) With The Witcher being their other primary franchise, they didn't want Cyberpunk to come across like "The Witcher but sci-fi," they wanted it to have a strongly differentiated brand identity, and making it first-person was a part of that.

2) Every single scene in the game is laboriously authored in the first-person perspective, it's significantly more difficult to block scenes when you only have exactly one camera angle relative to the player character to use. All of the staging and framing of more or less the entire game was built around the first-person perspective.
        Yes and kings field being fromsofts premier FPP game, they didn’t want to tarnish the immaculate reputation of that game so made demons/dark souls TPP. 

As someone who loved the Witcher I hated cyberpunk, in part because of the FPP lock.
            I have the exact opposite reaction so don't worry, it balances out.
    As a gamedev, third person is substantially harder and fps is more immersive.
        Yeah, FPS is definitely more immersive IMO. I'm glad they focused on making such a good first person perspective, it really helped the game
        Hard disagree, I know you're a gamedev and all, but what I find is that first person camera has very little impact on immersion, immersion is all about making the player believe the game environment is real and it's coherent and organic, a good example is non other than Red Dead Redemption 2
            I suspect it has more to do with gameplay than anything else. By forcing you into one or another, they can focus on combat for that mode instead of trying to make it good for both third and first person.

I honestly can’t think of many games that have good combat in both perspectives.
                >I honestly can’t think of many games that have good combat in both perspectives.

I don't think there's a single one. There are games which switch perspective with different weapons/scopes, like Mass Effect going first-person when you use a sniper scope, and that works fine, but all the Bethesda games play like shit in third person combat and look wonky as fuck too.
                    PUBG worked well in both, but that game was never AAA to begin with and it’s mostly because of the good gunplay, being as ADS switched to FPP being the default it wasn’t a difficult transition for most players to switch to FPP only, the benefit being you can’t get peaked behind corners, but pubg killed its playerbase and nothing about this is relevant. 

Recent example though, starfield plays decent in both perspectives, and as someone who mostly prefers third person, the amount I played has all been in FPP
                    And even ones that let you switch during gameplay/combat sections will pick one or the other for cutscenes/dialog moments - at least those that involve the player. 

Bethesda titles, for example - you can choose both, but you either get a third person or a first person view when in dialog, depending on the game.

GTAV would later add a first person toggle...but again, all scenes are third person.

Games basically pick one or the other, even if you don't have a choice for gameplay sections. Halo? FPS, switches to third person for cutscenes, and you don't have a choice. Tomb Raider? Third person all the way. CoD? FPS all the way. 

I'm struggling to think of a game that lets you play entirely in first person or third person, while also having the option for scenes to match what you've chosen for gameplay, much less a game that does that and has both options be of good quality.

Not saying it's impossible...but the work (both manpower/hours as well as technical challenges of making both angles look good) involved would be quite the challenge.
                Chivalry does this very well.
            Personally, I find first person hugely beneficial for immersion. Red Dead Redemption 2 is my 2nd favorite game of all-time, and I do agree it is more immersive than Cyberpunk in terms of small details and having every action be actually realized by the character.

However, I was still far more immersed in Cyberpunk thank In RDR2 simply because the first person perspective works so well. RDR2 has first person too, but it's rough, and it's far more fun to play in third person.
            I don't agree, I feel like cyberpunk is much more immersive than RDR2. RDR2 is more realistic with its interactions and all that, but it's not more immersive. You feel like you are watching a movie about Arthur, whereas with cyberpunk you feel like you are V.
            I find first person view in RDR2 to be far more immersive than third person. The game has both views available.
        >fps is more immersive

As a game player I disagree. It depends on other things.
            stop the cap, as a gamer FPP is more immersive than TPP for cyberpunk because you can really see the detail in the environment and the tall buildings and intimate moments with characters etc which would lose that effect in TPP
                It'd certainly change the impact of the game a lot. Many of the moments in the game are very much designed around first-person and characters looking at you and each other in a very naturalistic way.

Doing the same scenes with a third-person camera you'd need to shoot them more like film/TV-type scenes (as BG3 and Bioware games do), which can be highly effective, but is extremely different. It does reduce the direct emotional impact - but the upside is it makes some scenes more dramatic because they're so confusing in first person. Jumping/falling for example - in Mass Effect 2 there's a very dramatic jump Shepard (usually) makes, where the shot and music are really effective at conveying just barely making it. In first-person, the jump would *look* pretty easy if you used a reasonable distance, even if you played up barely making it.

You can also use cinematic techniques to do storytelling in third-person that don't really work in first person, but that's a whole long discussion.

Either way, FPP was the right choice for Cyberpunk in the end.
        As a player fps is not more immersive. Having the option to go third person is much more immersive than going to inventory to see your character.  Skyrim does both and it's really beneficial to immersion. 


But yeah it does seem harder.
            >Having the option to go third person is much more immersive than going to inventory to see your character.

That's not immersion, that's convenience.
            As a human who sees the world through eyes positioned in my face and not a camera hovering over my shoulder, first-person is a lot more immersive in games. But I can understand how 3rd person would be more natural for those of you who perceive reality through a drone hovering behind you at all times.
                Being able to go third player occasionally just lets me feel more immersed in the world. Because i can see "me" in the world. I can see where my character is standing, what my character is wearing. etc etc.
If it's always first person it feels more like i'm trapped in a viewport. 

Obviously this is a subjective thing.
            Disagree, as a player I find first person more immersive, and having the abilityto go to third person actually breaks my immersion. 

I actually didn't find Skyrim immersive at all, to be honest.
            I don't think you know what "immersive" means.
        It's absolutely not more immersive for everyone.

Nit making 3rd person as an option is one the biggest mistakes from devs.
            Not making third person allowed them to focus on good FPP combat instead of having the janky hybrid shit Bethesda does
                Surely adding it now was not an option either....
        FPS is not more immersive.
        Perspectives don't make things immersive.
            Yes they do, cyberpunk is much more immersirve than say GTA. what's your point?
                GTA 4 is more immersive than Cyberpunk
                GTA never goes for immersion, a more apt comparison is RDR2 which for is infinitely more immersive than Cyberpunk on every conceivable level, a game where 3rd person is the main style of play.

Artstyle, gameplay, animations, small details, NPC AI, and sound design make immersion not a mere perspective change.
                    Imagine for a second if portal was third person. It would lose something.
                    >RDR2 which for is infinitely more immersive than Cyberpunk on every conceivable level

I think they offer different types of immersion. RDR2 has very detailed graphics and incredible quality game mechanics, but the gameplay feels kinda slow, shooting is less fun, and the jokes are not so edgy. Cyberpunk has, on the other hand, a bit less realistic graphics (although the lighting and cinematic design are at the master level), somehow worse physics (improved in 2.0, but not to the degree of RDR2 or maybe even GTA V), and a bit clunky animations of some NPCs, but the game attracts attention so hard. The world design feels way more unique than in any game, movie or book I've played, seen or read in my life.

And the first-person perspective allowed smooth transitions between cutscenes and the gameplay, which, in my opinion, was a great decision, and contributed a lot to the immersion.
Man I’m so glad they didn’t go with 3rd person
Hmm... looks like Starfield.
    nowhere near enough loading screens
    It's kinda sad that you're right.
    Lol

I like that V’s carpet stayed the same
Wassup pat
Every game is "this" at one point. What's the deal?
From how people acted in 2020, this is what it looked like on release day.
Cyberpunk with Witcher 2 energy
Combat like this would've been a fucking nightmare.
At least they had visible cyberware, where’d that go🤦‍♂️
    You can see hand and arm cyberware (the stuff for smart weapons changes your palms, mantis blades/monowire/arm cannon/gorilla arms all make your forearms look different from one another)
        Yeah just want to get as chromed out as the NPCs

Games still 10/10
Oh man 3rd person view... I wish that was optional.
WHAT IS THIS TOOTHBRUSH SOUND ALL TIME ??
Man, I wish we could switch between first & third person views in the final game.
Wish the 3rd person view made it into the game, such a massive disappointed.
    It was too much work for them
Looks like Geralts walking animation
Why do I hear someone brushing their teeth through the whole vid!!?
They really committed to that floor pattern didn't they?
This is literally all video games at one point...
It was in 2013, and we would have bought it cause it woude have been nova back then
Looks like an iconic game from the 2000s in an alternate universe
Why did this feel like Max Payne
Anyone else notice the brushing teeth sound throughout this entire clip!?! Wtf.
The voice acting though 🤣 "What was his name? Fred? Red?.........yeahhhh that's him"
Why does it sound like someone is brushing their teeth the entire time… it never fucking stopped.
Cyberpunk 2077 2
Everyone saying it looks like a porn game. I'm here thinking, "Why does this look like playstation home?"
Whats up with the fucking toothbrushing noises Lol
I tend to love games with low res graphics. If it had ps1 graphics, I would play it until my keyboard breaks.
Cyberjunk in the Trunk! 😂
no fkn way 💀
there is no way this was 2077
I have to say that I'm glad this game wasn't in 3rd person. Not even sure how they'd do some of the cyberware katana combat stuff that I did in 3rd person without it being janky af.
Looks like it would of gone hard as an Xbox 360 game
This looks like an earlier David Cage game.
![gif](giphy|4zGaQs6SOoUNxuYRQI)
Who’s brushing their teeth the whole time?
This looks like a mobile game ad
I remember when this dropped and a ton of people were screeching that it proved the game "should have" been I'm third person. If anything, it proved to me that it sure as shit shouldn't have been.
Cyberpunk 2077 (PS2 port)
STOP FUCKING BRUSHING YOUR TEETH MY GOD MAN YOURE JUST SPREADING BLOOD AROUND I KNOW IT
well... the light seems fine...
How do I buy this BD chooms?
Boobies!
Conversation with the neighbor has the same energy as, “I can’t tell you that, it’s confidential. Anyway how’s your sex life?”
I'm seeing this after just finishing Phantom Liberty and it is astounding how much more effort and work went into the game from this point. It really is such a great game despite all the issues at launch.
This is nuts
Wait WTF!! Visible body cyberware? Interacitve seating? Your partner lives with you? Full in world nudity? WHERE THE FUCK DID ALL THIS GO!??!? Also third person with some pretty decent movement animation.
That’s the Overlook Hotel carpet pattern. We’re gonna play with V forever, and ever, and ever.
i really hope Orion stays in first person
looks like they straight-up copied assets from Deus Ex: Human Revolution. even the UI is almost identical from the way it wiggles whenever your character moves
God damn it I want TPP!!!
This looks like Starfield now lol
My motionsickned brain would love 3rd person....
I still do not understand how people think that Cyberpunk 2077 would benefit from TPP

Edit: TPP copers trying not to come up with "I could finally see my clothes" as the only argument for adding TPP challange (impossible)
    Maybe because in a game with character customization itd be nice to actually be able to SEE your character during regular gameplay.
    I prefer playing third person games. And with how much I'm hopping and skipping all over the place with double jump and air dashes, I sometimes lose track of enemies in combat, which I don't do in say Mass Effect Andromeda (the first third person game that came to mind for me rn that has double jump and air dashes.)

Also, I like to climb shit and that's always more clunky in first person
    Ummm maybe seeing your fucking clothes?
    I think they just wanna see their drip all the time, not necessarily that they'd prefer to play that way. I mean, some people might. But they're weird.
    About a million different ways, including being able to do stuff like wallrunning that was literally announced before. The biggest advantage is the game wouldn't have had to be remade from the start in 1PP, causing it to be shit at release
    I could explain it to you but I can't understand it for you.
My biggest complaint is dropping 3rd person. So much of the cyberpunk experience and aesthetic is the body changing. SHOW ME THE CYBERNETICS. I wanna be a borged out freak. All I get is to see my hands?

It's my absolute number 1 complaint and is a design decision that I do not agree with and I truly wish they don't repeat it in the future.
So the game almost completely changed between this point and release (and then it still needed a 2.0);  characters, story, gameplay, hell even VAs. Wonder what this game would've looked like if it they keep this concept. How many characters actually survived from this version of the story, and how far in the process characters we love were created.
    It’s unlikely most of this stuff was seriously meant to continue to the actual game.  As others have said, it looks like very early testing stuff.
    > hell even VAs

There weren't VAs, they were probably developers doing the voice for the prototype.
    If you watch the early trailer it has Sandra going cyber psycho and then the implication is the player somehow has rescued her and they are working for max tac?


Definitely a completely different story.
        What?

1) Do you mean Sandra Dorsett? If so, you're wrong. Cyberpsycho from trailer and Sandra are two different characters

2) There is nothing implying "the player somehow has rescued her". Its just the rare case of Max Tac not killing for some reason. Maybe because she wasn't aggressive when they came? In the teaser she's just sitting there, so maybe that's why they decided to let her leave, and join them
            No I don't mean Sandra dorset. 

The original name got moved around, her name was Melissa Rory.....  but watch the trailer, she's dressed exactly the same there as she is here.
                Sorry than, I dont remember her name, not the original one, nor the one she was given in the final game.
                    Melissa Rory is actually in the game!

If you go to the corporate clothes shop there is a robbery and max tac shows up. If you scan them, one is Melissa
    This is literally an early prototype put together with devs doing the voice acting. It serves no purpose apart from to get a vision of the final game down, there were probably more prototypes which slowly morphed into something resembling the cyberpunk we have today
At least it had 3rd person
Cyberpunk 2069.
This wasn't CP2077.

This was an internal demo at CDPR where they were working on technology and mechanics to see what works and what doesn't.

Every AAA super star game you've loved - and thought was a master work of artistic design and execution had MANY shitty alpha and beta versions like this that you'll never see.
this was basically a porn game 😭
This trailer feels more interactive than the game we got. Ofc this was just a test and long before the game started production
Wish it was still tpp
I'm glad they went with first person
Looks like starfield :(
Somehow still better than Starfield
    Are you high?
where tf did this come from lmao
Who the fuck is brushing their teeth
Bro!

How you got a got a girl naked in the apartment in this early ass dead version of the game but in the completed version the closest thing we got to experience being in a relationship with our romance is resting and waking up with them on the end.

Dead!!

Give me my hoe taking a shower in the morning and wandering the apartment in her birthday suit.
Still looks better than Starfield.
Third person mode and visible cyberwares...... These two I still want in the game..... hope in cp2 it will be there.
The loss of a 3rd person mode was a big one.
Mass effect weeb edition
Looks like starfield final game
Damn. I don't need the third person tbh but I would love to see my sandy installed into my spine.
Not gonna lie, I would love a Third Person version of the game, but I get why CDPR went for the first person view. This looks cool but as already has been said, it looks a lot like The Witcher but Sci Fi, and even when the game was already getting compared with games like GTA, with this the comparisons would have been very unforgiving. 

And let's admit it, the "is for more immersion" does not apply (at least for me) as games like The Witcher keeps me very immersed with the story and the gameplay, so done correctly Cyberpunk could have been a good game in third person, besides, it was notable at first that First Person games weren't the strong point of CDPR ad the guns felt weird and lots of animations were very strange even in FPV. 

But the truth is that CDPR tried to fix all that, and the details on the first person view are something else, since day one. The wink Jackie gives you when you tell Dex that Evelyn tried to get rid of him, the eye roll that Judy gives you when you ask her about Susie being her boss, the smile from the clouds' receptionist when you ask about the dolls and so on, are things that maybe would go unnoticed if the game were just third person.
Wait this is what it looked like at launch? 💀
I wish we had a 3rd person toggle tho
Still better than the Day One Cyberpunk
Cyberjunk 2020-20
Isnt this Nindendo hand console edition?
It seem intresting tho even looking like a porn game
More chrome on V than the actual game.
At least they had flying cars there
more importantly, third person
yo--can i get 3rd person Cyberpunk? I'd like that. Sort of how fallout lets you do both.
Oh I remember this. It was the 1.6 patch right? /s
Crazy that third-person didn’t make it but the carpet from the Shining did.
Gives me bethesda vibes Lolol
I actually like this version. It needs polish obviously, but it would have been just as great as it is now.
I wish we had the option for first person or third person similar to Bethesda games. Sucks we spend time customizing our character but don’t see it a lot.
Yeah this was cyberpunk on lunch
Why do modern games hate nudity so much? Except a very few studios.
Ngl, if someone managed to make a super clean 3rd person mod, I wouldn't mind trying it out and do a smart weapons only run.
3rd person would've enhanced the experience along with noticeable cyber mods... hoping the sequel adds both.
Yeah this sucks but VISUAL CYBERWARE
Console? PC never looked like this IME
Wait. We can play in 3rd person?
That's the worst thing about cyberpunk is that it's not in third person. Why go through all the trouble of customizing your character if you never ever see them? Except mirrors that don't work unless you push a button. How hard would it have been to have just shown your face during conversations only or something like that?
1:45 thank me later
Kinda wish they kept the 3rd person instead of going with 1st. Either way it's still a great game so can't really complain.
Aside from lots of polish I'd unironically enjoy that game way more. The apartment instantly feels way more alive than it does now. No idea about the rest of the game (if there even is in that prototype) and that's obviously a huge amount of work but idk how they went from this apartment to the apartment now.
Part of me still longs for a 3rd person Cyberpunk. I think I always will.
any more info on this?
why this graphic looks like from 2006???? is this legit cp77? Or some fake?
They should have kept the third person
Tbf it never looked like that on PC at launch.

Sure, if you own a crappy old PS4 it’s gonna look like shit; surprise.
Looks like a Bethesda game tbf
They should’ve kept the third person option, would’ve been nice.
RIP Third person 😔
I wish they would had everything that was at shown at e3 even 3rd person cut scene once in a while would have made a big difference
Third person must be there in final release
I’d legitimately give anything for the game to still be third person. Only thing I don’t like about the game as it stands right now is
Wish we had 3rd person view now in game. That would be so perfect. Cyberpunk 2077 needs 3rd person view. After all, it is style over substance.👍
It really bugs me that they didn’t even try to work on 3 person models for the actual release
3rd person would be dope
You’re telling me in this version I can sit but I can’t in the final? Wtf
So at one point well before launch, V knew how to sleep in a bed?
how does this version of the game have visible chrome on the back but ours doesn’t
Fake. V is sleeping the right way on the bed.
Looks way better than the actual shitty Game😂
Bethesda games always look so janky in third person.
The Shining carpets, nice
Seriously wonder how many times they had to reboot the development
I thought this was soem cheap knock off game lol
Cyberpunk 2007
Upgraded version of omicron
He walks like an ark character
This is actually a test level made in 2013 with TW2 version of the REDengine.
I wonder if they really wanted to use bullets from archive or it's just a placeholder
Why on earth does it sound like someone is brushing their teeth lol.
The leaked GTA VI pre-alpha looked in a similar way, and we can be sure that the final graphics and game mechanics will be breathtaking (supposedly better than RDR2). It's nothing new in the game industry.
This looks and feels like Alpha Protocol lol
average ps3 game damn.
PS4
GTA-5 PS3 edition
Lmfao
Probably a concept build is my guess
it still is on ps4s
I'm not going to lie, if this had released in like the PS2 or PS3 era, where the graphics belong, I absolutely would have played this. Hell, I'd play this now if it released on PS2/3 as a demake type thing, if someone rebuilt it and got it to run on those systems.
That’s interesting
thats not cyberpunk 2077. thats the ascent.
Cyber skunk 2077 a surreal stinker
Neighbor looks like Placide
I don’t remember it being this bad.
Cyberpunk teethbrushing soundtrack original score.
open world dead space
M favourite part was when he cyberpunked everyone
This is kinda cool reminds me off obscure early 2000s games
Pretty sure mine never looked like that, not even during 1.0
Looks like what a switch port would look like
Wow...

This is Goddamn worthless!
Looks more like Cyberpunk Y2K.
This will be Cyberpunk 2077 in 2013
Honestly, I can see it.

You can already see a lot of the concepts that would make it into the final game. It's amazing what all the filters, particle effects, and art and design teams were able to change it into, and everything being in first person covers up a lot of V's janky movements, but that's recognizably Cyberpunk 2077
This voice acting was bottom shelf
Is this pre-alpha footage from 10 years ago, or something?
Looks like an asset flip. :D
Cyberpunk 2077 as made for the late PS2/early PS3.
Thrilled that I waited til 2.0 to buy the game.. I’m enjoying it way more than Starfield and prob as much as I did BG3 and I’m a huge BG nerd
At least you have a visible sandevistan
What is up with the constant sound of someone brushing their teeth?
Someone had really clean teeth though...
Looks like cyberpunk 2067
kids in 2000 thought that this was the highest end shit ever and had their jaws on the floor back then...
it's crazy that sculpture practically survived completely intact to the final game...
I could see a more sim approach added with the sequel. But maybe they lean into the ARPG even harder
I haven't played since release. Sounds like I should give it another try?
That may be the case but the original trailer was far cooler than the current one.
Would've been cool if it were like this in 2.0, but then too many people would complain that it looks too much like GTA
Whose game was this?
What's with the constant noise of someone brushing teeth?
I do wish that Cyberpunk had an optional 3rd person view like Bethesda and Rockstar games have. Cyberpunk is a game with a lot of customization I find it a shame that you can't run round in 3rd person and see your character. I wouldn't mind even if you were forced into 1st person for diologe and combat. I just want to run around in 3rd person.
watching this reminded me of dreamfall: the longest journey
Not crazy at all. It's an early demo from a decade ago
What the fuck is even that
That sound was driving me crazy. I thought it was some sort of nightmare scene.
This comment literally has me in tears 🤣🤣🤣

        nice.
    I guarantee there's a game out there actually called this lol

        Yep. that game definitely exists in the Cyberpunk world as well as ours, I bet.

    low tier ps3 game high tier porn game
Tbh, I actually thought this was a shitpost using some porn game footage
    Yea, until someone mentioned it being pre alpha from 8-10 years ago, it looked like a heavily modded gta porn clone, plus that dialogue really didn't help. 

Its realistic though, walking around your apartment without a shirt, bothering your neighbour from the patio, and your partner showering naked while brushing their teeth is 10/10 realism.

"You won't last 30 seconds playing this game"
Just wait until you get to cock sizes.
I remember when it first leaked and the hate for the game was in full swing. People kept saying this is what the game should have been. It was so damn stupid.
    Pffffhahaha

Of course they were. Yeah this doesn't look like shit in the slightest lol
    >People kept saying this is what the game should have been

Honestly, I'm expecting the downvotes: It should be.

&#x200B;

Like, the final game is *okay*, but it's **no where** near what they hyped it up to be. This looks more similar to the "we're bringing the TTRPG systems to video games" that they hyped up during the course of development.

&#x200B;

I don't think a playable version of this leaked with the engine source though. So who knows how far along (if anything) it was from what was shown of these developer/alpha builds.
        It's a four minute video of some guy walking around in a room talking to people. You can do that in the game right now.
        based. apparently people here can't tell the difference between a finished game and an obvious build that's barely past pre-production. like all those morons on twitter when the gta6 footage leaked.

Cyberhump 42069
when the game came out back then. I remember seeing a porn game ad It was named: Cyberslut 2069 !
You know now that you actually mention it Cyberpunk does kinda give off 3D porn vibes😭
You guys realize every in development game has the fidelity of a shitty porn game?
This was never cyberpunk, I’ve been playing since release
Not that chrome on his back tho😭
    It looks too generic tbh. That's probably why. But yes I agree we should have more freedom and control over our cyberware appearance.
        https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4547
            Probably doesn’t even work with the update
                Mods only got outdated because the big dependency mods all the others plug into were fucked by the patch...for about a week.

Those are updated. Most of the CP2077 mod library works again, plug and play.
                I'm using it currently works just fine.
        ...Then make some interesting options for your back?
            ... That's literally what they're asking for? What are you trying to say rn
                They're saying it doesn't exist because it's too generic. Instead we just don't have options? That makes no sense. If the reason is it is too generic, they could just make a design that isn't generic.
                    The one depicted *in this video* is generic, not back cyberware as a whole. Not sure how one could reach that conclusion.
                    Are you doing ok?
            you will literally never see your back
                I exclusively ride motorcycles, I prob see my back more than I see my face.
                I literally never see my face, yet there's a lot of facewear/helmets/hats what's your point?
                    Must be hard not using your inventory...
yea the feeling i get from watching this is similar to the first witcher game
    I’m going to call this build Cyberpunk 2057
Reminds me of Mass effect a little bit
    Definitely
    Could you imagine if we got a 3PS cyberpunk like mass effect 👀
        My biggest frustration with the game, it's not that was overselling itself or the many senseless gameplay choices (I love the game tho). It was the lack of 3rd person 
For a role playing game that advertised "be who u wanna be in this fashion crazy looking world", it's stupid to have a 1st person view, so why have a character creator and styles choices?, as is completely irrelevant outside using a bike lol, that's why I think it was a "last minute change" in order to keep up with the stupid deadlines, as is easier to have "most" animations hidden. And that could be ok, but cutscenes are like that too, which furder disconnects u from V, as u no longer see him/her, (in trailers game used to have 3rd person, more cinematic cutscenes, maybe were unfinished too and removed entirely, go watch them again and tell me it's not better). U could argue it's more immersive now, but imo, V it's not a silent protagonist as other games, it has clearly defined personality, just like Gerald in Witcher, so leaves me not feeling like I'm V, but not also fully knowing V, at least phissically, it felts lazy to me to have free camera control in scenes.
3rd person Cyberpunk it's my wettest dream, but it's never going to happen, a 2.0 update with it maybe in the style of RE8 would of been amazing.
            lol… I agree there should’ve been the OPTION of third person, but the first person experience in cyberpunk sets a new standard that I think all FPS games should follow if a first person view is in their game.  I love how well done it is and I can’t imagine taking that away.  Why do we have to have one or the other, how about both?
                I think 3rd person was always the intend, but 1srt turned out very well at least. Yep, I would kill for the option, and yes, a Bethesda approach where you decide which camera to use is so cool, specifically in a role playing game, "see the world through your protagonist or see how it becomes one"
I get Knights of the Old Republic vibes
I was really surprised that wasn't in the cards in the game. Maybe they felt it was too exploitative?
    Yeah, makes sense. It's kind of weird for someone who experienced severe trauma to fall in love with the guy that rescued them. Feels more like a trauma response than genuine.
        I get that, but they could have made it a long burn romance.  Have more than two missions kinda thing, where she doesn't initially take to you, even for saving her.  

I just wish there were more romance options is all, doesn't even have to be Sandra.
            Homo for Goro for sure
            still no, thats gross.

                            No, I'm pointing out that what you are so worried about is not always the case. I think you just made my point to be honest.

People want to be so afraid it is always happening, they can't relax enough to understand that it is not always happening.
                            What is an inappropriate age gap?

Is 20 years too much? Does that change when it's a woman that's older vs a man? Does the lowest age matter? Like is 18/38 worse than 30/50?

I dated a woman that was 20 years older than me, If anything she was the one that left hurt. She was hot and I was coming out of a shitty relationship and just wanted sex. So am I the abuser? Or her for being "predatory" going after someone 20 years younger. Would the situation be different if I was a woman and it was a man? 

Imbalanced power dynamics.. so one person works at Burger King the other is a DA for the city? If they love each other what's the issue? 

Grooming? Yeah that's clearly wrong. That's someone taking all the things you just mentioned and using it in a manipulative way. Intentions are what matter. Unfortunately bad intentions exist even without anything you mentioned.
        Would she even remember?

To her it would just be some gonk going: "Hey, I remember saving you from some scavs"

"Well, I lost 36 hours back then. Didn't really take in any faces."
I thought at the start of the second quest involving her that it might go that direction when I first played it
It wasn't Sandra Dorsett, just some women named Sandra. Sandra Dorsett didn't even have a name when they begin the work on that quest (which happened a long time after this prototype was done), with her being called simply "Kidnapped girl".
    No. It's Sandra Dorsett. They just completey reworked her character for the actual game. Most of the characters were already at least a concept on paper at this point.
        It's not. Even in the game files she initially didn't have a name. Saying that it's Dorsett just because she happens to share a common female name with a women from a several years old prototype is just silly.
            Both versions start with a Sandra. It’s not exactly a leap to connect the two.
Sounds like a repeated loop of someone brushing their teeth
    I'm so glad I wasn't the only hearing that and thinking exactly the same thing.
    I mean it clearly was naked lady in bathroom.
        But the loop happened for the full 4 minutes, even when she was dressed in the living room
            It's just a half assed proof of concept, not finished game)
[ brushes teeth ]  

what sound?
I remember i had the password to it once but i forgot it since it was a while ago but yea this prototype is in it.
    Wouldn't happen to be FF06B5?
    That’s neat. Why was it put in there? Do you know?
        It was originally going to be built in RedEngine 3
I would unironically enjoy playing this. Think it's still possible?
    Probably if the password was found. There are rumors that some people got in at some point(like the guy commenting earlier claims he did). Most leads I've seen over the past year have gone nowhere. 

Edit: There actually were some assets from this build leftover in the Witcher 3 GOG GOTY edition ver 1.31-1.32. I discovered them last year and was kinda surprised nobody had discovered them back in the day cause people were dying to hear anything about Cyberpunk pre 2018.
        What assets were in the Witcher 3?
            Maybe he meant this https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7050
That's a real early version of the game, yes.

It leaked a while ago.
    I doubt it was leaked just now, I saw the screenshots a few years ago. This is probably a version of the game using the Witcher 2 engine or something
        This was leaked with the CP2077 and Witcher source codes shortly after launch
        Nah, it would be branched off from the REDengine version that Witcher 3 used, but it looks like shit since everything is placeholder assets created just to test out the game concept.
            Yeah, it's basically a story board.  Use some cheap ass, super easy to use engine to build out environments to story board.  Even the voice actor is not a voice actor, just someone in the office reading lines.
        Did they edit it? Because the comment just says a while ago, which doesn't necessarily mean recently.
            Sorry, I forgot that "while" can also be used in the context of a longer period of time.>!non-english native moment!<

Sorry for being rude mister baname!
    [deleted]
        What is "a while" to you?
            The guy before you really just woke up and decided to argue over the most pointless things.
Leaked footage from while ago. I think the game was pretty much scraped and build from ground up between this and release.
Like a beta build if I recall.
    This is more like early Alpha. This was probably around the same time they put out the original announcement teaser.
        Not even Alpha. This is a prototype.
            Not even prototype. This is only a POC
                Not even a POC, this is just a tribute
                    Nay!  We are but men!
                        #ROCK!
                            AAAAAHHHHHHHH
                    Couldn't remember the POC, this is just a tribute
                Not even a POC. This is only
                    No this is Patrick
            Not even a prototype, but a video on my phone
        More like pre-alpha prototyping
        Yeah couldn't recall, this seems more like an engine test, seeing how things come together.
            Yeah this seems more like early intern work, seeing how it looks like crap
                An intern couldn't do all this. It's a prototype. Of course it's going to look like crap. Like, what the fuck are you all complaining about lmao
                    Congrats you got the joke
        more like prototype
    This is not even Pre-Alpha friend. This is a prototyping build. Alpha implies that all features of a game must be functional. This is nowhere near all features.
        thats incorrect. an alpha is when the features and mechanics are being developed. a prototype isnt even at the point where they are for real developing the final mechanics.

Beta is when all features are mostly complete, and production goes from developing to polishing fixing and optomizing.
            definitely a prototype. nobody starts a game off looking like the end product, it's a lot faster to build prototypes to test everything before you start putting effort into it looking like a finished game

edit: you guys are lucky they even bothered to model characters, if this were my game they'd all be capsules with beautiful gradients and shaders because I wasted too much time making my prototype look really nice for what it is even though I'm going to replace everything anyway, but maybe that's all you gamers deserve!
    And even then they had 3rd person smh
        it was running on witcher 3's engine at the time (august 2013) when this prototyope was built, it wasn't possible for FPP because the engine didnt allow it but they always wanted it to be in FPP
Keep in mind it was first annouced back in 2013 or something.
i was thinking the exact same thing lol
yea i know but it’s interesting to see how the aesthetics kinda went from generic sci fi like maybe mass effect,  to something more like judge dredd’s cyberpunk in the e3 2018 build
    I think you might be mistaking the simple lighting and untextured polygons of a prototype for intentional aesthetics. There are some textures, but most of it seems to be untextured or with very flat textures.

I don't think the aesthetic of 2077 was ever intended to be this clean, light, bright and so on, because the original trailer, 10 years ago, before this even, was much darker and grittier in tone.
        When he goes to look off in the distance, I remembered Keanu saying “the city is breathtaking” lol well it certainly took awhile to get there
        the first ever concept art  was like this and the cyberpunk 2077 we have now back in may 31 2012 when they revealed their new IP
            >the first ever concept art  was like this

No, it wasn't. Unless you're going to link me some concept art I've never seen, it 100% was not.

This isn't from May 2012, this is from August 2013, long after the teaser trailer, which has the same general look as the game we got.

The earliest concept art is this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/97n4o0/first\_ever\_cyberpunk\_2077\_concept\_art\_released/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/97n4o0/first_ever_cyberpunk_2077_concept_art_released/)
                no shit its from august 2013, im talking about the first concept art that you linked and another one with a giant robot  which was revealed in may 2012 during the summer conference at cdpr which looked colorful like this and in the final game the same colorfullness can be found in many areas like the afterlife which looks exactly the same as that concept art etc.   


and then theres many other concept arts from pre production which are colorful as well https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/albums/2875189
                    The concept art has always been "colourful", sure, including the piece I linked, but that's not "like this" aesthetically.

None of the concept art you've linked looks anything like the extremely bright, zero detail, very white-centric look of this early prototype, which looks like ultra-generic sci-fi or a porn game or something (because it's a prototype, not an intentional aesthetic).

(The most interesting think about that James Daly link is that his stuff looks more similar to Cyberpunk 2020 than what we actually got in the end - it's pretty cool.)
                        Ok what about this concept art which has that bright zero detail white centric look that you talk about [https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq](https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq) plus the 2018 demo also had this type of look.  


not really the concept art on that james created look like what we have in the game [https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/projects/18Wgo2?album\_id=2875189](https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/projects/18Wgo2?album_id=2875189) the second image looks exactly like heywood in the final game same brick buildings, at the bottom you can see those mechanical things that hold buildings which can be found in the game etc.
                            >Ok what about this concept art which has that bright zero detail white centric look that you talk about https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq plus the 2018 demo also had this type of look.

The 2018 demo does not have "that kind of look":

[https://youtu.be/sjH48Xs-5OA?si=jTboZXPxUNpYViYf](https://youtu.be/sjH48Xs-5OA?si=jTboZXPxUNpYViYf)

Honestly what are you talking about? There's no bright white zero detail there?

As for your link, I'd love to go through, but Windows is telling me that is not safe. Hopefully he just needs to update his site certificate or something, but mate, I ain't opening that.
                                what do u mean theres no bright white zero detail in the demo? go to the part where V takes sandra to trauma team you can see the bright whites and the part where they overlook the city after taking out the scavenger AV you can see the bright white lighting, or when V is walking up the stairs after the corpo meeting to enter her vehicle you can see that the bright white look, looks the same as the prototype. and there wasnt much detail in that demo it looked too clean and flat. also the link i sent is a false positive, its a devs portfolio
                Can you delete your comment? He was definitely right and you're, well, just wrong.
                    Did you respond on the wrong comment?
                        Lmfao no. u/kmcwwdfwa_fv324 is right. You're technically wrong. "Did I respond to the wrong comment" lmao. Pretty full of yourself aren't you?
    It is just an early prototype. Details are usually intentionally omitted so they can experiment on what direction they want to take.
    Yes that's why art department exists. They give character.
    It really looks like starfield lmao
Does every game at this stage have recorded actors' voice lines?
    I doubt those were actual actors. Probably just people on the team voiced lines in order to make this little proof of concept demo more interesting for whatever presentation it was intended for.
    v sounded like he was voiced by the programmer..
    If they want to test it as well, of course. 

Why not? 

They can even get actors for motion capture.
        Sure, I mean if it's something common. I don't want to argue or anything.
no, this is just proof of concept demo. Later on Cyberpunk's dev was handed to a completely different team that worked on The Witcher 3. That was the biggest mistake CDPR ever did. Success of The Witcher 3 gave them delusions of grandeur, so they started smelling their own farts. you can tell by all the "hype" video and all the parties, celebrities, and bullshit claims they in the interviews. it all culminated when they straight up lied to players about the state of PS4 and Xbox One versions (that infamous video where they drove the car around Night City REALLY slow to avoid asset loading bugs), and when they paid journalists to lie about state of the game, because they all gave it 10/10 few days before release before players got hands of it, and these scores were later retracted.
    State of game was fine, if you didn't run it on a patato from 15 years ago. 
Yeah, they made the mistake of letting it start on those systems in the first place.
        I played it on a $4,000 PC at launch and it was decisively not fine lol, it only ran great compared to the last-gen console shitshow.
            I played it on a $500 console at launch and it was very fine.
                I played it on PC at release and it was fine also
No shit Sherlock. No one is saying they don’t.
Obviously based on the same animation
It's a reference to the shining
    How do u know?
        By looking at it
They have for  a while now
I thought it pulled the room together
Nah the PlayStation 4 version was much worse.
That’s actually one of the main reasons why I enjoy my motorcycle. One of the few times I get to see my character.
    You can see yourself in the driver's seat if you use the zoomed-out camera on regular cars, too.
    I'm really surprised they haven't added this yet. There's no reason not to at this point
        Remaking tons of animations from first person to fit third person isn't super easy. But yeah I'd also like third person, at least in the sequel game if they can as an option
but then i also want my witcher3 first Person version xD
Maybe in the next game since they are switching engines
    It’s not an engine issue it’s clearly a creative choice to stay mostly 1st person
        Mike Pondsmith specifically told them they need to do it in first person.
        It’s an engine issue. They were originally making it to be  3rd person but couldn’t figure out the animations so they had to claim it was not immersive enough.
            But the witcher 3 is in 3rd person and use the same engine.

Its clearly a creative decision
                The Witcher 3 also doesn’t have you double jumping, dashing through the air, flying to enemies with a melee lock on, and (before it got scrapped) wall running/latching.  The fast moment to moment gameplay with V flying everywhere is what made the 3rd person view hard for them I suppose, although I do wish we could see our character in 3rd person even if it was only outside combat encounters
                    but that's not an engine issue. It is  design decision to NOT make the animations necessary for that perspective.  


there are 3rd person mods that make it possible and you can clearly see the animations were never refined for it.
                    > I do wish we could see our character in 3rd person even if it was only outside combat encounters

That’s one of the reasons why I ride a bike everywhere in this game (the other reason being the superior driving mechanics).
                    Stop being an arm chair dev lol, your claims have no basis in fact.
                        You clearly haven't messed with a late game katana build then because I don't see how any modern game studio could do that kind of combat justice in 3rd person. I don't think you realize how much dev time this would require and how much of our current first person experience would be sacrificed because of it.
                            I'm not saying that it's easy I'm saying he has no claim to what he's saying. What we know is that the devs decided FPP for creative reasons not because they found TPP implementation hard.
                    I don't think you understand what "game engine" means.
            "Couldn't figure out the animations" wtf does that even mean? Why state your uninformed speculation as fact?
                especially since they literally said 3 months before the initial release date that they decided to switch to 1st person only for artistic choices.

the initial playthrough of the all foods factory mission has 3rd person sections.
            Somehow I don't think you know very much about any game engine
            This is totally wrong.
    Modders did it within days after the game came out, what makes you think 3rd person in a video game is an engine limitation?
        except its buggy
            The whole game is buggy
                You're missing the point. The point is that 3rd party implementations tend to not be as polished as official ones. So yeah, there is a 3rd person mod, but it's also shitty as hell.
                     No, you’re missing the point. It’s clearly not an engine limitation if third party mods can do it, even with jank.
                        Neither of us are missing the point, because the only point Im making is that janky implementations aren't a good substitute. The only way third person would ever be good is in the sequel, because they could have levels designed for third person, they could make all the dialogue interactions in third person, that's what I mean. It's not enough to just make third person, you also need to accommodate the rest of the game for it.
All a modder does is make third person mod, but they don't change the rest of the game to make it work with third person.


Besides, I don't think CDPR ever mentioned it being an engine limitation anyways, it was a design decision, the same way Dark Souls doesn't have toggleable first-person view with difficulty settings, like could you imagine Dark Souls having an easy mode? Lmao that'd be dumb as hell. This is always the biggest of irony of the game industry. We want developers to do what they want instead of listening shareholders or market studies or whatever but then later we go "no your game NEEDS X features" and we make the biggest fucking noise over it.
                every game has bugs
    Idk why people keep thinking my comment was about engine limitations. Maybe it’s cause I wasn’t specific. All I said was maybe we’ll have the option for both in the new engine. That’s it, that’s all the comment meant.
        But this is like saying "I hope the actors get to kiss on the DVD release", as if they weren't able to before during filming of a show or movie.
        Yes and people are telling you you’re misguided because the engine has nothing to do with that. If they planned on adding third person they would do it regardless of switching engines or not.
            Y’all are so desperate for conflict. It’s literally just me agreeing with the original guy and saying it would be cool. I only brought up the engine cause the next game is literally on a different engine. No other reason.
                I think they are just trying to let you know that even on a different engine, it has nothing to do with whether they make it first or third person or both.
So bringing it up was kind of a mute point, it doesn't change their decision or influence it. They purely made it first person only to focus on things like facial animations and close up detail.
It's not supposed to be a conflict, they are just explaining where the thought process doesn't make sense.
        I'd say there are engine limits at play. The game has a huge issue with LOD, pop ins and render distance. 

Definitely not the only factor though
            You’d be wrong. It makes no sense.
I think this was even before the Xbox one/ps4 Gen so makes sense
The game was orginally announced at E3 2013 and the One/PS4 were released the November of the same year a few months after. SO yeah, it probably would have been built with that level of asset detail in mind.
That's really impressive considering most prototypes look like N64 games.
You got the wrong ending.
> I mean I didn’t find any naked girl in my shower during my playthrough ???

Have you tried getting different endings as there is absolutely one with exactly this.
    It was more for the meme but i’m actually waiting a bit for after last DLC to play again the game with full mods. So I didn’t know :/

But hey, why do I have to do a whole playthrough to get 1 girl in my shower tho ?
        It's a prize (?)
        Play on PC and spawn as many as you want
If there's anything that browsing Cyberpunk 2077 Nexus mods taught me, it's that there's a huge demand from horndogs everywhere for lewd content in video games
Why not? This was pre-Xbox one/PS4 era.
august 2013
2012.
This was probably what CDPR had from the first announcement.
2013 probably since the walking animation is reused from Witcher 2.
2077
The answer they've *repeatedly* given is twofold:

1) With The Witcher being their other primary franchise, they didn't want Cyberpunk to come across like "The Witcher but sci-fi," they wanted it to have a strongly differentiated brand identity, and making it first-person was a part of that.

2) Every single scene in the game is laboriously authored in the first-person perspective, it's significantly more difficult to block scenes when you only have exactly one camera angle relative to the player character to use. All of the staging and framing of more or less the entire game was built around the first-person perspective.
    Yes and kings field being fromsofts premier FPP game, they didn’t want to tarnish the immaculate reputation of that game so made demons/dark souls TPP. 

As someone who loved the Witcher I hated cyberpunk, in part because of the FPP lock.
        I have the exact opposite reaction so don't worry, it balances out.
As a gamedev, third person is substantially harder and fps is more immersive.
    Yeah, FPS is definitely more immersive IMO. I'm glad they focused on making such a good first person perspective, it really helped the game
    Hard disagree, I know you're a gamedev and all, but what I find is that first person camera has very little impact on immersion, immersion is all about making the player believe the game environment is real and it's coherent and organic, a good example is non other than Red Dead Redemption 2
        I suspect it has more to do with gameplay than anything else. By forcing you into one or another, they can focus on combat for that mode instead of trying to make it good for both third and first person.

I honestly can’t think of many games that have good combat in both perspectives.
            >I honestly can’t think of many games that have good combat in both perspectives.

I don't think there's a single one. There are games which switch perspective with different weapons/scopes, like Mass Effect going first-person when you use a sniper scope, and that works fine, but all the Bethesda games play like shit in third person combat and look wonky as fuck too.
                PUBG worked well in both, but that game was never AAA to begin with and it’s mostly because of the good gunplay, being as ADS switched to FPP being the default it wasn’t a difficult transition for most players to switch to FPP only, the benefit being you can’t get peaked behind corners, but pubg killed its playerbase and nothing about this is relevant. 

Recent example though, starfield plays decent in both perspectives, and as someone who mostly prefers third person, the amount I played has all been in FPP
                And even ones that let you switch during gameplay/combat sections will pick one or the other for cutscenes/dialog moments - at least those that involve the player. 

Bethesda titles, for example - you can choose both, but you either get a third person or a first person view when in dialog, depending on the game.

GTAV would later add a first person toggle...but again, all scenes are third person.

Games basically pick one or the other, even if you don't have a choice for gameplay sections. Halo? FPS, switches to third person for cutscenes, and you don't have a choice. Tomb Raider? Third person all the way. CoD? FPS all the way. 

I'm struggling to think of a game that lets you play entirely in first person or third person, while also having the option for scenes to match what you've chosen for gameplay, much less a game that does that and has both options be of good quality.

Not saying it's impossible...but the work (both manpower/hours as well as technical challenges of making both angles look good) involved would be quite the challenge.
            Chivalry does this very well.
        Personally, I find first person hugely beneficial for immersion. Red Dead Redemption 2 is my 2nd favorite game of all-time, and I do agree it is more immersive than Cyberpunk in terms of small details and having every action be actually realized by the character.

However, I was still far more immersed in Cyberpunk thank In RDR2 simply because the first person perspective works so well. RDR2 has first person too, but it's rough, and it's far more fun to play in third person.
        I don't agree, I feel like cyberpunk is much more immersive than RDR2. RDR2 is more realistic with its interactions and all that, but it's not more immersive. You feel like you are watching a movie about Arthur, whereas with cyberpunk you feel like you are V.
        I find first person view in RDR2 to be far more immersive than third person. The game has both views available.
    >fps is more immersive

As a game player I disagree. It depends on other things.
        stop the cap, as a gamer FPP is more immersive than TPP for cyberpunk because you can really see the detail in the environment and the tall buildings and intimate moments with characters etc which would lose that effect in TPP
            It'd certainly change the impact of the game a lot. Many of the moments in the game are very much designed around first-person and characters looking at you and each other in a very naturalistic way.

Doing the same scenes with a third-person camera you'd need to shoot them more like film/TV-type scenes (as BG3 and Bioware games do), which can be highly effective, but is extremely different. It does reduce the direct emotional impact - but the upside is it makes some scenes more dramatic because they're so confusing in first person. Jumping/falling for example - in Mass Effect 2 there's a very dramatic jump Shepard (usually) makes, where the shot and music are really effective at conveying just barely making it. In first-person, the jump would *look* pretty easy if you used a reasonable distance, even if you played up barely making it.

You can also use cinematic techniques to do storytelling in third-person that don't really work in first person, but that's a whole long discussion.

Either way, FPP was the right choice for Cyberpunk in the end.
    As a player fps is not more immersive. Having the option to go third person is much more immersive than going to inventory to see your character.  Skyrim does both and it's really beneficial to immersion. 


But yeah it does seem harder.
        >Having the option to go third person is much more immersive than going to inventory to see your character.

That's not immersion, that's convenience.
        As a human who sees the world through eyes positioned in my face and not a camera hovering over my shoulder, first-person is a lot more immersive in games. But I can understand how 3rd person would be more natural for those of you who perceive reality through a drone hovering behind you at all times.
            Being able to go third player occasionally just lets me feel more immersed in the world. Because i can see "me" in the world. I can see where my character is standing, what my character is wearing. etc etc.
If it's always first person it feels more like i'm trapped in a viewport. 

Obviously this is a subjective thing.
        Disagree, as a player I find first person more immersive, and having the abilityto go to third person actually breaks my immersion. 

I actually didn't find Skyrim immersive at all, to be honest.
        I don't think you know what "immersive" means.
    It's absolutely not more immersive for everyone.

Nit making 3rd person as an option is one the biggest mistakes from devs.
        Not making third person allowed them to focus on good FPP combat instead of having the janky hybrid shit Bethesda does
            Surely adding it now was not an option either....
    FPS is not more immersive.
    Perspectives don't make things immersive.
        Yes they do, cyberpunk is much more immersirve than say GTA. what's your point?
            GTA 4 is more immersive than Cyberpunk
            GTA never goes for immersion, a more apt comparison is RDR2 which for is infinitely more immersive than Cyberpunk on every conceivable level, a game where 3rd person is the main style of play.

Artstyle, gameplay, animations, small details, NPC AI, and sound design make immersion not a mere perspective change.
                Imagine for a second if portal was third person. It would lose something.
                >RDR2 which for is infinitely more immersive than Cyberpunk on every conceivable level

I think they offer different types of immersion. RDR2 has very detailed graphics and incredible quality game mechanics, but the gameplay feels kinda slow, shooting is less fun, and the jokes are not so edgy. Cyberpunk has, on the other hand, a bit less realistic graphics (although the lighting and cinematic design are at the master level), somehow worse physics (improved in 2.0, but not to the degree of RDR2 or maybe even GTA V), and a bit clunky animations of some NPCs, but the game attracts attention so hard. The world design feels way more unique than in any game, movie or book I've played, seen or read in my life.

And the first-person perspective allowed smooth transitions between cutscenes and the gameplay, which, in my opinion, was a great decision, and contributed a lot to the immersion.
nowhere near enough loading screens
It's kinda sad that you're right.
Lol
You can see hand and arm cyberware (the stuff for smart weapons changes your palms, mantis blades/monowire/arm cannon/gorilla arms all make your forearms look different from one another)
    Yeah just want to get as chromed out as the NPCs

Games still 10/10
It was too much work for them
Maybe because in a game with character customization itd be nice to actually be able to SEE your character during regular gameplay.
I prefer playing third person games. And with how much I'm hopping and skipping all over the place with double jump and air dashes, I sometimes lose track of enemies in combat, which I don't do in say Mass Effect Andromeda (the first third person game that came to mind for me rn that has double jump and air dashes.)

Also, I like to climb shit and that's always more clunky in first person
Ummm maybe seeing your fucking clothes?
I think they just wanna see their drip all the time, not necessarily that they'd prefer to play that way. I mean, some people might. But they're weird.
About a million different ways, including being able to do stuff like wallrunning that was literally announced before. The biggest advantage is the game wouldn't have had to be remade from the start in 1PP, causing it to be shit at release
I could explain it to you but I can't understand it for you.
It’s unlikely most of this stuff was seriously meant to continue to the actual game.  As others have said, it looks like very early testing stuff.
> hell even VAs

There weren't VAs, they were probably developers doing the voice for the prototype.
If you watch the early trailer it has Sandra going cyber psycho and then the implication is the player somehow has rescued her and they are working for max tac?


Definitely a completely different story.
    What?

1) Do you mean Sandra Dorsett? If so, you're wrong. Cyberpsycho from trailer and Sandra are two different characters

2) There is nothing implying "the player somehow has rescued her". Its just the rare case of Max Tac not killing for some reason. Maybe because she wasn't aggressive when they came? In the teaser she's just sitting there, so maybe that's why they decided to let her leave, and join them
        No I don't mean Sandra dorset. 

The original name got moved around, her name was Melissa Rory.....  but watch the trailer, she's dressed exactly the same there as she is here.
            Sorry than, I dont remember her name, not the original one, nor the one she was given in the final game.
                Melissa Rory is actually in the game!

If you go to the corporate clothes shop there is a robbery and max tac shows up. If you scan them, one is Melissa
This is literally an early prototype put together with devs doing the voice acting. It serves no purpose apart from to get a vision of the final game down, there were probably more prototypes which slowly morphed into something resembling the cyberpunk we have today
Are you high?

Yea, until someone mentioned it being pre alpha from 8-10 years ago, it looked like a heavily modded gta porn clone, plus that dialogue really didn't help. 

Its realistic though, walking around your apartment without a shirt, bothering your neighbour from the patio, and your partner showering naked while brushing their teeth is 10/10 realism.

Of course they were. Yeah this doesn't look like shit in the slightest lol
>People kept saying this is what the game should have been

Honestly, I'm expecting the downvotes: It should be.

&#x200B;

Like, the final game is *okay*, but it's **no where** near what they hyped it up to be. This looks more similar to the "we're bringing the TTRPG systems to video games" that they hyped up during the course of development.

&#x200B;

I don't think a playable version of this leaked with the engine source though. So who knows how far along (if anything) it was from what was shown of these developer/alpha builds.
    It's a four minute video of some guy walking around in a room talking to people. You can do that in the game right now.
    based. apparently people here can't tell the difference between a finished game and an obvious build that's barely past pre-production. like all those morons on twitter when the gta6 footage leaked.
It looks too generic tbh. That's probably why. But yes I agree we should have more freedom and control over our cyberware appearance.

    ...Then make some interesting options for your back?
        ... That's literally what they're asking for? What are you trying to say rn
            They're saying it doesn't exist because it's too generic. Instead we just don't have options? That makes no sense. If the reason is it is too generic, they could just make a design that isn't generic.
                The one depicted *in this video* is generic, not back cyberware as a whole. Not sure how one could reach that conclusion.
                Are you doing ok?

                Must be hard not using your inventory...
I’m going to call this build Cyberpunk 2057
Definitely
Could you imagine if we got a 3PS cyberpunk like mass effect 👀
    My biggest frustration with the game, it's not that was overselling itself or the many senseless gameplay choices (I love the game tho). It was the lack of 3rd person 
For a role playing game that advertised "be who u wanna be in this fashion crazy looking world", it's stupid to have a 1st person view, so why have a character creator and styles choices?, as is completely irrelevant outside using a bike lol, that's why I think it was a "last minute change" in order to keep up with the stupid deadlines, as is easier to have "most" animations hidden. And that could be ok, but cutscenes are like that too, which furder disconnects u from V, as u no longer see him/her, (in trailers game used to have 3rd person, more cinematic cutscenes, maybe were unfinished too and removed entirely, go watch them again and tell me it's not better). U could argue it's more immersive now, but imo, V it's not a silent protagonist as other games, it has clearly defined personality, just like Gerald in Witcher, so leaves me not feeling like I'm V, but not also fully knowing V, at least phissically, it felts lazy to me to have free camera control in scenes.
3rd person Cyberpunk it's my wettest dream, but it's never going to happen, a 2.0 update with it maybe in the style of RE8 would of been amazing.
        lol… I agree there should’ve been the OPTION of third person, but the first person experience in cyberpunk sets a new standard that I think all FPS games should follow if a first person view is in their game.  I love how well done it is and I can’t imagine taking that away.  Why do we have to have one or the other, how about both?
            I think 3rd person was always the intend, but 1srt turned out very well at least. Yep, I would kill for the option, and yes, a Bethesda approach where you decide which camera to use is so cool, specifically in a role playing game, "see the world through your protagonist or see how it becomes one"
Yeah, makes sense. It's kind of weird for someone who experienced severe trauma to fall in love with the guy that rescued them. Feels more like a trauma response than genuine.
    I get that, but they could have made it a long burn romance.  Have more than two missions kinda thing, where she doesn't initially take to you, even for saving her.  

I just wish there were more romance options is all, doesn't even have to be Sandra.
        Homo for Goro for sure

                        No, I'm pointing out that what you are so worried about is not always the case. I think you just made my point to be honest.

People want to be so afraid it is always happening, they can't relax enough to understand that it is not always happening.
                        What is an inappropriate age gap?

Is 20 years too much? Does that change when it's a woman that's older vs a man? Does the lowest age matter? Like is 18/38 worse than 30/50?

I dated a woman that was 20 years older than me, If anything she was the one that left hurt. She was hot and I was coming out of a shitty relationship and just wanted sex. So am I the abuser? Or her for being "predatory" going after someone 20 years younger. Would the situation be different if I was a woman and it was a man? 

Imbalanced power dynamics.. so one person works at Burger King the other is a DA for the city? If they love each other what's the issue? 

Grooming? Yeah that's clearly wrong. That's someone taking all the things you just mentioned and using it in a manipulative way. Intentions are what matter. Unfortunately bad intentions exist even without anything you mentioned.
    Would she even remember?

To her it would just be some gonk going: "Hey, I remember saving you from some scavs"

"Well, I lost 36 hours back then. Didn't really take in any faces."
No. It's Sandra Dorsett. They just completey reworked her character for the actual game. Most of the characters were already at least a concept on paper at this point.
    It's not. Even in the game files she initially didn't have a name. Saying that it's Dorsett just because she happens to share a common female name with a women from a several years old prototype is just silly.
        Both versions start with a Sandra. It’s not exactly a leap to connect the two.
I'm so glad I wasn't the only hearing that and thinking exactly the same thing.
I mean it clearly was naked lady in bathroom.
    But the loop happened for the full 4 minutes, even when she was dressed in the living room
        It's just a half assed proof of concept, not finished game)
Wouldn't happen to be FF06B5?
That’s neat. Why was it put in there? Do you know?
    It was originally going to be built in RedEngine 3
Probably if the password was found. There are rumors that some people got in at some point(like the guy commenting earlier claims he did). Most leads I've seen over the past year have gone nowhere. 

Edit: There actually were some assets from this build leftover in the Witcher 3 GOG GOTY edition ver 1.31-1.32. I discovered them last year and was kinda surprised nobody had discovered them back in the day cause people were dying to hear anything about Cyberpunk pre 2018.
    What assets were in the Witcher 3?
        Maybe he meant this https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7050
I doubt it was leaked just now, I saw the screenshots a few years ago. This is probably a version of the game using the Witcher 2 engine or something
    This was leaked with the CP2077 and Witcher source codes shortly after launch
    Nah, it would be branched off from the REDengine version that Witcher 3 used, but it looks like shit since everything is placeholder assets created just to test out the game concept.
        Yeah, it's basically a story board.  Use some cheap ass, super easy to use engine to build out environments to story board.  Even the voice actor is not a voice actor, just someone in the office reading lines.
    Did they edit it? Because the comment just says a while ago, which doesn't necessarily mean recently.
        Sorry, I forgot that "while" can also be used in the context of a longer period of time.>!non-english native moment!<

Sorry for being rude mister baname!

    What is "a while" to you?
        The guy before you really just woke up and decided to argue over the most pointless things.
This is more like early Alpha. This was probably around the same time they put out the original announcement teaser.
    Not even Alpha. This is a prototype.
        Not even prototype. This is only a POC
            Not even a POC, this is just a tribute
                Nay!  We are but men!
                    #ROCK!
                        AAAAAHHHHHHHH
                Couldn't remember the POC, this is just a tribute
            Not even a POC. This is only
                No this is Patrick
        Not even a prototype, but a video on my phone
    More like pre-alpha prototyping
    Yeah couldn't recall, this seems more like an engine test, seeing how things come together.
        Yeah this seems more like early intern work, seeing how it looks like crap
            An intern couldn't do all this. It's a prototype. Of course it's going to look like crap. Like, what the fuck are you all complaining about lmao
                Congrats you got the joke
    more like prototype
This is not even Pre-Alpha friend. This is a prototyping build. Alpha implies that all features of a game must be functional. This is nowhere near all features.
    thats incorrect. an alpha is when the features and mechanics are being developed. a prototype isnt even at the point where they are for real developing the final mechanics.

Beta is when all features are mostly complete, and production goes from developing to polishing fixing and optomizing.
        definitely a prototype. nobody starts a game off looking like the end product, it's a lot faster to build prototypes to test everything before you start putting effort into it looking like a finished game

edit: you guys are lucky they even bothered to model characters, if this were my game they'd all be capsules with beautiful gradients and shaders because I wasted too much time making my prototype look really nice for what it is even though I'm going to replace everything anyway, but maybe that's all you gamers deserve!
And even then they had 3rd person smh
    it was running on witcher 3's engine at the time (august 2013) when this prototyope was built, it wasn't possible for FPP because the engine didnt allow it but they always wanted it to be in FPP
I think you might be mistaking the simple lighting and untextured polygons of a prototype for intentional aesthetics. There are some textures, but most of it seems to be untextured or with very flat textures.

I don't think the aesthetic of 2077 was ever intended to be this clean, light, bright and so on, because the original trailer, 10 years ago, before this even, was much darker and grittier in tone.
    When he goes to look off in the distance, I remembered Keanu saying “the city is breathtaking” lol well it certainly took awhile to get there
    the first ever concept art  was like this and the cyberpunk 2077 we have now back in may 31 2012 when they revealed their new IP
        >the first ever concept art  was like this

No, it wasn't. Unless you're going to link me some concept art I've never seen, it 100% was not.

This isn't from May 2012, this is from August 2013, long after the teaser trailer, which has the same general look as the game we got.

The earliest concept art is this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/97n4o0/first\_ever\_cyberpunk\_2077\_concept\_art\_released/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/97n4o0/first_ever_cyberpunk_2077_concept_art_released/)
            no shit its from august 2013, im talking about the first concept art that you linked and another one with a giant robot  which was revealed in may 2012 during the summer conference at cdpr which looked colorful like this and in the final game the same colorfullness can be found in many areas like the afterlife which looks exactly the same as that concept art etc.   


and then theres many other concept arts from pre production which are colorful as well https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/albums/2875189
                The concept art has always been "colourful", sure, including the piece I linked, but that's not "like this" aesthetically.

None of the concept art you've linked looks anything like the extremely bright, zero detail, very white-centric look of this early prototype, which looks like ultra-generic sci-fi or a porn game or something (because it's a prototype, not an intentional aesthetic).

(The most interesting think about that James Daly link is that his stuff looks more similar to Cyberpunk 2020 than what we actually got in the end - it's pretty cool.)
                    Ok what about this concept art which has that bright zero detail white centric look that you talk about [https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq](https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq) plus the 2018 demo also had this type of look.  


not really the concept art on that james created look like what we have in the game [https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/projects/18Wgo2?album\_id=2875189](https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/projects/18Wgo2?album_id=2875189) the second image looks exactly like heywood in the final game same brick buildings, at the bottom you can see those mechanical things that hold buildings which can be found in the game etc.
                        >Ok what about this concept art which has that bright zero detail white centric look that you talk about https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq plus the 2018 demo also had this type of look.

The 2018 demo does not have "that kind of look":

[https://youtu.be/sjH48Xs-5OA?si=jTboZXPxUNpYViYf](https://youtu.be/sjH48Xs-5OA?si=jTboZXPxUNpYViYf)

Honestly what are you talking about? There's no bright white zero detail there?

As for your link, I'd love to go through, but Windows is telling me that is not safe. Hopefully he just needs to update his site certificate or something, but mate, I ain't opening that.
                            what do u mean theres no bright white zero detail in the demo? go to the part where V takes sandra to trauma team you can see the bright whites and the part where they overlook the city after taking out the scavenger AV you can see the bright white lighting, or when V is walking up the stairs after the corpo meeting to enter her vehicle you can see that the bright white look, looks the same as the prototype. and there wasnt much detail in that demo it looked too clean and flat. also the link i sent is a false positive, its a devs portfolio
            Can you delete your comment? He was definitely right and you're, well, just wrong.
                Did you respond on the wrong comment?
                    Lmfao no. u/kmcwwdfwa_fv324 is right. You're technically wrong. "Did I respond to the wrong comment" lmao. Pretty full of yourself aren't you?
It is just an early prototype. Details are usually intentionally omitted so they can experiment on what direction they want to take.
Yes that's why art department exists. They give character.
It really looks like starfield lmao
I doubt those were actual actors. Probably just people on the team voiced lines in order to make this little proof of concept demo more interesting for whatever presentation it was intended for.
v sounded like he was voiced by the programmer..
If they want to test it as well, of course. 

Why not? 

They can even get actors for motion capture.
    Sure, I mean if it's something common. I don't want to argue or anything.
State of game was fine, if you didn't run it on a patato from 15 years ago. 
Yeah, they made the mistake of letting it start on those systems in the first place.
    I played it on a $4,000 PC at launch and it was decisively not fine lol, it only ran great compared to the last-gen console shitshow.
        I played it on a $500 console at launch and it was very fine.
            I played it on PC at release and it was fine also
How do u know?
    By looking at it
You can see yourself in the driver's seat if you use the zoomed-out camera on regular cars, too.
I'm really surprised they haven't added this yet. There's no reason not to at this point
    Remaking tons of animations from first person to fit third person isn't super easy. But yeah I'd also like third person, at least in the sequel game if they can as an option
It’s not an engine issue it’s clearly a creative choice to stay mostly 1st person
    Mike Pondsmith specifically told them they need to do it in first person.
    It’s an engine issue. They were originally making it to be  3rd person but couldn’t figure out the animations so they had to claim it was not immersive enough.
        But the witcher 3 is in 3rd person and use the same engine.

Its clearly a creative decision
            The Witcher 3 also doesn’t have you double jumping, dashing through the air, flying to enemies with a melee lock on, and (before it got scrapped) wall running/latching.  The fast moment to moment gameplay with V flying everywhere is what made the 3rd person view hard for them I suppose, although I do wish we could see our character in 3rd person even if it was only outside combat encounters
                but that's not an engine issue. It is  design decision to NOT make the animations necessary for that perspective.  


there are 3rd person mods that make it possible and you can clearly see the animations were never refined for it.
                > I do wish we could see our character in 3rd person even if it was only outside combat encounters

That’s one of the reasons why I ride a bike everywhere in this game (the other reason being the superior driving mechanics).
                Stop being an arm chair dev lol, your claims have no basis in fact.
                    You clearly haven't messed with a late game katana build then because I don't see how any modern game studio could do that kind of combat justice in 3rd person. I don't think you realize how much dev time this would require and how much of our current first person experience would be sacrificed because of it.
                        I'm not saying that it's easy I'm saying he has no claim to what he's saying. What we know is that the devs decided FPP for creative reasons not because they found TPP implementation hard.
                I don't think you understand what "game engine" means.
        "Couldn't figure out the animations" wtf does that even mean? Why state your uninformed speculation as fact?
            especially since they literally said 3 months before the initial release date that they decided to switch to 1st person only for artistic choices.

the initial playthrough of the all foods factory mission has 3rd person sections.
        Somehow I don't think you know very much about any game engine
        This is totally wrong.
Modders did it within days after the game came out, what makes you think 3rd person in a video game is an engine limitation?
    except its buggy
        The whole game is buggy
            You're missing the point. The point is that 3rd party implementations tend to not be as polished as official ones. So yeah, there is a 3rd person mod, but it's also shitty as hell.
                 No, you’re missing the point. It’s clearly not an engine limitation if third party mods can do it, even with jank.
                    Neither of us are missing the point, because the only point Im making is that janky implementations aren't a good substitute. The only way third person would ever be good is in the sequel, because they could have levels designed for third person, they could make all the dialogue interactions in third person, that's what I mean. It's not enough to just make third person, you also need to accommodate the rest of the game for it.
All a modder does is make third person mod, but they don't change the rest of the game to make it work with third person.


Besides, I don't think CDPR ever mentioned it being an engine limitation anyways, it was a design decision, the same way Dark Souls doesn't have toggleable first-person view with difficulty settings, like could you imagine Dark Souls having an easy mode? Lmao that'd be dumb as hell. This is always the biggest of irony of the game industry. We want developers to do what they want instead of listening shareholders or market studies or whatever but then later we go "no your game NEEDS X features" and we make the biggest fucking noise over it.
            every game has bugs
Idk why people keep thinking my comment was about engine limitations. Maybe it’s cause I wasn’t specific. All I said was maybe we’ll have the option for both in the new engine. That’s it, that’s all the comment meant.
    But this is like saying "I hope the actors get to kiss on the DVD release", as if they weren't able to before during filming of a show or movie.
    Yes and people are telling you you’re misguided because the engine has nothing to do with that. If they planned on adding third person they would do it regardless of switching engines or not.
        Y’all are so desperate for conflict. It’s literally just me agreeing with the original guy and saying it would be cool. I only brought up the engine cause the next game is literally on a different engine. No other reason.
            I think they are just trying to let you know that even on a different engine, it has nothing to do with whether they make it first or third person or both.
So bringing it up was kind of a mute point, it doesn't change their decision or influence it. They purely made it first person only to focus on things like facial animations and close up detail.
It's not supposed to be a conflict, they are just explaining where the thought process doesn't make sense.
    I'd say there are engine limits at play. The game has a huge issue with LOD, pop ins and render distance. 

Definitely not the only factor though
        You’d be wrong. It makes no sense.
It was more for the meme but i’m actually waiting a bit for after last DLC to play again the game with full mods. So I didn’t know :/

But hey, why do I have to do a whole playthrough to get 1 girl in my shower tho ?
    It's a prize (?)
    Play on PC and spawn as many as you want
Yes and kings field being fromsofts premier FPP game, they didn’t want to tarnish the immaculate reputation of that game so made demons/dark souls TPP. 

As someone who loved the Witcher I hated cyberpunk, in part because of the FPP lock.
    I have the exact opposite reaction so don't worry, it balances out.
Yeah, FPS is definitely more immersive IMO. I'm glad they focused on making such a good first person perspective, it really helped the game
Hard disagree, I know you're a gamedev and all, but what I find is that first person camera has very little impact on immersion, immersion is all about making the player believe the game environment is real and it's coherent and organic, a good example is non other than Red Dead Redemption 2
    I suspect it has more to do with gameplay than anything else. By forcing you into one or another, they can focus on combat for that mode instead of trying to make it good for both third and first person.

I honestly can’t think of many games that have good combat in both perspectives.
        >I honestly can’t think of many games that have good combat in both perspectives.

I don't think there's a single one. There are games which switch perspective with different weapons/scopes, like Mass Effect going first-person when you use a sniper scope, and that works fine, but all the Bethesda games play like shit in third person combat and look wonky as fuck too.
            PUBG worked well in both, but that game was never AAA to begin with and it’s mostly because of the good gunplay, being as ADS switched to FPP being the default it wasn’t a difficult transition for most players to switch to FPP only, the benefit being you can’t get peaked behind corners, but pubg killed its playerbase and nothing about this is relevant. 

Recent example though, starfield plays decent in both perspectives, and as someone who mostly prefers third person, the amount I played has all been in FPP
            And even ones that let you switch during gameplay/combat sections will pick one or the other for cutscenes/dialog moments - at least those that involve the player. 

Bethesda titles, for example - you can choose both, but you either get a third person or a first person view when in dialog, depending on the game.

GTAV would later add a first person toggle...but again, all scenes are third person.

Games basically pick one or the other, even if you don't have a choice for gameplay sections. Halo? FPS, switches to third person for cutscenes, and you don't have a choice. Tomb Raider? Third person all the way. CoD? FPS all the way. 

I'm struggling to think of a game that lets you play entirely in first person or third person, while also having the option for scenes to match what you've chosen for gameplay, much less a game that does that and has both options be of good quality.

Not saying it's impossible...but the work (both manpower/hours as well as technical challenges of making both angles look good) involved would be quite the challenge.
        Chivalry does this very well.
    Personally, I find first person hugely beneficial for immersion. Red Dead Redemption 2 is my 2nd favorite game of all-time, and I do agree it is more immersive than Cyberpunk in terms of small details and having every action be actually realized by the character.

However, I was still far more immersed in Cyberpunk thank In RDR2 simply because the first person perspective works so well. RDR2 has first person too, but it's rough, and it's far more fun to play in third person.
    I don't agree, I feel like cyberpunk is much more immersive than RDR2. RDR2 is more realistic with its interactions and all that, but it's not more immersive. You feel like you are watching a movie about Arthur, whereas with cyberpunk you feel like you are V.
    I find first person view in RDR2 to be far more immersive than third person. The game has both views available.
>fps is more immersive

As a game player I disagree. It depends on other things.
    stop the cap, as a gamer FPP is more immersive than TPP for cyberpunk because you can really see the detail in the environment and the tall buildings and intimate moments with characters etc which would lose that effect in TPP
        It'd certainly change the impact of the game a lot. Many of the moments in the game are very much designed around first-person and characters looking at you and each other in a very naturalistic way.

Doing the same scenes with a third-person camera you'd need to shoot them more like film/TV-type scenes (as BG3 and Bioware games do), which can be highly effective, but is extremely different. It does reduce the direct emotional impact - but the upside is it makes some scenes more dramatic because they're so confusing in first person. Jumping/falling for example - in Mass Effect 2 there's a very dramatic jump Shepard (usually) makes, where the shot and music are really effective at conveying just barely making it. In first-person, the jump would *look* pretty easy if you used a reasonable distance, even if you played up barely making it.

You can also use cinematic techniques to do storytelling in third-person that don't really work in first person, but that's a whole long discussion.

Either way, FPP was the right choice for Cyberpunk in the end.
As a player fps is not more immersive. Having the option to go third person is much more immersive than going to inventory to see your character.  Skyrim does both and it's really beneficial to immersion. 


But yeah it does seem harder.
    >Having the option to go third person is much more immersive than going to inventory to see your character.

That's not immersion, that's convenience.
    As a human who sees the world through eyes positioned in my face and not a camera hovering over my shoulder, first-person is a lot more immersive in games. But I can understand how 3rd person would be more natural for those of you who perceive reality through a drone hovering behind you at all times.
        Being able to go third player occasionally just lets me feel more immersed in the world. Because i can see "me" in the world. I can see where my character is standing, what my character is wearing. etc etc.
If it's always first person it feels more like i'm trapped in a viewport. 

Obviously this is a subjective thing.
    Disagree, as a player I find first person more immersive, and having the abilityto go to third person actually breaks my immersion. 

I actually didn't find Skyrim immersive at all, to be honest.
    I don't think you know what "immersive" means.
It's absolutely not more immersive for everyone.

Nit making 3rd person as an option is one the biggest mistakes from devs.
    Not making third person allowed them to focus on good FPP combat instead of having the janky hybrid shit Bethesda does
        Surely adding it now was not an option either....
FPS is not more immersive.
Perspectives don't make things immersive.
    Yes they do, cyberpunk is much more immersirve than say GTA. what's your point?
        GTA 4 is more immersive than Cyberpunk
        GTA never goes for immersion, a more apt comparison is RDR2 which for is infinitely more immersive than Cyberpunk on every conceivable level, a game where 3rd person is the main style of play.

Artstyle, gameplay, animations, small details, NPC AI, and sound design make immersion not a mere perspective change.
            Imagine for a second if portal was third person. It would lose something.
            >RDR2 which for is infinitely more immersive than Cyberpunk on every conceivable level

I think they offer different types of immersion. RDR2 has very detailed graphics and incredible quality game mechanics, but the gameplay feels kinda slow, shooting is less fun, and the jokes are not so edgy. Cyberpunk has, on the other hand, a bit less realistic graphics (although the lighting and cinematic design are at the master level), somehow worse physics (improved in 2.0, but not to the degree of RDR2 or maybe even GTA V), and a bit clunky animations of some NPCs, but the game attracts attention so hard. The world design feels way more unique than in any game, movie or book I've played, seen or read in my life.

And the first-person perspective allowed smooth transitions between cutscenes and the gameplay, which, in my opinion, was a great decision, and contributed a lot to the immersion.
Yeah just want to get as chromed out as the NPCs

Games still 10/10
What?

1) Do you mean Sandra Dorsett? If so, you're wrong. Cyberpsycho from trailer and Sandra are two different characters

2) There is nothing implying "the player somehow has rescued her". Its just the rare case of Max Tac not killing for some reason. Maybe because she wasn't aggressive when they came? In the teaser she's just sitting there, so maybe that's why they decided to let her leave, and join them
    No I don't mean Sandra dorset. 

The original name got moved around, her name was Melissa Rory.....  but watch the trailer, she's dressed exactly the same there as she is here.
        Sorry than, I dont remember her name, not the original one, nor the one she was given in the final game.
            Melissa Rory is actually in the game!

If you go to the corporate clothes shop there is a robbery and max tac shows up. If you scan them, one is Melissa

It's a four minute video of some guy walking around in a room talking to people. You can do that in the game right now.
based. apparently people here can't tell the difference between a finished game and an obvious build that's barely past pre-production. like all those morons on twitter when the gta6 footage leaked.

    Probably doesn’t even work with the update
        Mods only got outdated because the big dependency mods all the others plug into were fucked by the patch...for about a week.

Those are updated. Most of the CP2077 mod library works again, plug and play.
        I'm using it currently works just fine.
...Then make some interesting options for your back?
    ... That's literally what they're asking for? What are you trying to say rn
        They're saying it doesn't exist because it's too generic. Instead we just don't have options? That makes no sense. If the reason is it is too generic, they could just make a design that isn't generic.
            The one depicted *in this video* is generic, not back cyberware as a whole. Not sure how one could reach that conclusion.

        I literally never see my face, yet there's a lot of facewear/helmets/hats what's your point?
            Must be hard not using your inventory...
My biggest frustration with the game, it's not that was overselling itself or the many senseless gameplay choices (I love the game tho). It was the lack of 3rd person 
For a role playing game that advertised "be who u wanna be in this fashion crazy looking world", it's stupid to have a 1st person view, so why have a character creator and styles choices?, as is completely irrelevant outside using a bike lol, that's why I think it was a "last minute change" in order to keep up with the stupid deadlines, as is easier to have "most" animations hidden. And that could be ok, but cutscenes are like that too, which furder disconnects u from V, as u no longer see him/her, (in trailers game used to have 3rd person, more cinematic cutscenes, maybe were unfinished too and removed entirely, go watch them again and tell me it's not better). U could argue it's more immersive now, but imo, V it's not a silent protagonist as other games, it has clearly defined personality, just like Gerald in Witcher, so leaves me not feeling like I'm V, but not also fully knowing V, at least phissically, it felts lazy to me to have free camera control in scenes.
3rd person Cyberpunk it's my wettest dream, but it's never going to happen, a 2.0 update with it maybe in the style of RE8 would of been amazing.
    lol… I agree there should’ve been the OPTION of third person, but the first person experience in cyberpunk sets a new standard that I think all FPS games should follow if a first person view is in their game.  I love how well done it is and I can’t imagine taking that away.  Why do we have to have one or the other, how about both?
        I think 3rd person was always the intend, but 1srt turned out very well at least. Yep, I would kill for the option, and yes, a Bethesda approach where you decide which camera to use is so cool, specifically in a role playing game, "see the world through your protagonist or see how it becomes one"
I get that, but they could have made it a long burn romance.  Have more than two missions kinda thing, where she doesn't initially take to you, even for saving her.  

I just wish there were more romance options is all, doesn't even have to be Sandra.
    Homo for Goro for sure
    still no, thats gross.

People want to be so afraid it is always happening, they can't relax enough to understand that it is not always happening.
                    What is an inappropriate age gap?

Is 20 years too much? Does that change when it's a woman that's older vs a man? Does the lowest age matter? Like is 18/38 worse than 30/50?

I dated a woman that was 20 years older than me, If anything she was the one that left hurt. She was hot and I was coming out of a shitty relationship and just wanted sex. So am I the abuser? Or her for being "predatory" going after someone 20 years younger. Would the situation be different if I was a woman and it was a man? 

Imbalanced power dynamics.. so one person works at Burger King the other is a DA for the city? If they love each other what's the issue? 

Grooming? Yeah that's clearly wrong. That's someone taking all the things you just mentioned and using it in a manipulative way. Intentions are what matter. Unfortunately bad intentions exist even without anything you mentioned.
Would she even remember?

To her it would just be some gonk going: "Hey, I remember saving you from some scavs"

"Well, I lost 36 hours back then. Didn't really take in any faces."
It's not. Even in the game files she initially didn't have a name. Saying that it's Dorsett just because she happens to share a common female name with a women from a several years old prototype is just silly.
    Both versions start with a Sandra. It’s not exactly a leap to connect the two.
But the loop happened for the full 4 minutes, even when she was dressed in the living room
    It's just a half assed proof of concept, not finished game)
It was originally going to be built in RedEngine 3
What assets were in the Witcher 3?
    Maybe he meant this https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7050
This was leaked with the CP2077 and Witcher source codes shortly after launch
Nah, it would be branched off from the REDengine version that Witcher 3 used, but it looks like shit since everything is placeholder assets created just to test out the game concept.
    Yeah, it's basically a story board.  Use some cheap ass, super easy to use engine to build out environments to story board.  Even the voice actor is not a voice actor, just someone in the office reading lines.
Did they edit it? Because the comment just says a while ago, which doesn't necessarily mean recently.

        An intern couldn't do all this. It's a prototype. Of course it's going to look like crap. Like, what the fuck are you all complaining about lmao
            Congrats you got the joke
more like prototype
thats incorrect. an alpha is when the features and mechanics are being developed. a prototype isnt even at the point where they are for real developing the final mechanics.

Beta is when all features are mostly complete, and production goes from developing to polishing fixing and optomizing.
    definitely a prototype. nobody starts a game off looking like the end product, it's a lot faster to build prototypes to test everything before you start putting effort into it looking like a finished game

edit: you guys are lucky they even bothered to model characters, if this were my game they'd all be capsules with beautiful gradients and shaders because I wasted too much time making my prototype look really nice for what it is even though I'm going to replace everything anyway, but maybe that's all you gamers deserve!
it was running on witcher 3's engine at the time (august 2013) when this prototyope was built, it wasn't possible for FPP because the engine didnt allow it but they always wanted it to be in FPP
When he goes to look off in the distance, I remembered Keanu saying “the city is breathtaking” lol well it certainly took awhile to get there
the first ever concept art  was like this and the cyberpunk 2077 we have now back in may 31 2012 when they revealed their new IP
    >the first ever concept art  was like this

No, it wasn't. Unless you're going to link me some concept art I've never seen, it 100% was not.

This isn't from May 2012, this is from August 2013, long after the teaser trailer, which has the same general look as the game we got.

The earliest concept art is this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/97n4o0/first\_ever\_cyberpunk\_2077\_concept\_art\_released/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/97n4o0/first_ever_cyberpunk_2077_concept_art_released/)
        no shit its from august 2013, im talking about the first concept art that you linked and another one with a giant robot  which was revealed in may 2012 during the summer conference at cdpr which looked colorful like this and in the final game the same colorfullness can be found in many areas like the afterlife which looks exactly the same as that concept art etc.   


and then theres many other concept arts from pre production which are colorful as well https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/albums/2875189
            The concept art has always been "colourful", sure, including the piece I linked, but that's not "like this" aesthetically.

None of the concept art you've linked looks anything like the extremely bright, zero detail, very white-centric look of this early prototype, which looks like ultra-generic sci-fi or a porn game or something (because it's a prototype, not an intentional aesthetic).

(The most interesting think about that James Daly link is that his stuff looks more similar to Cyberpunk 2020 than what we actually got in the end - it's pretty cool.)
                Ok what about this concept art which has that bright zero detail white centric look that you talk about [https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq](https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq) plus the 2018 demo also had this type of look.  


not really the concept art on that james created look like what we have in the game [https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/projects/18Wgo2?album\_id=2875189](https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/projects/18Wgo2?album_id=2875189) the second image looks exactly like heywood in the final game same brick buildings, at the bottom you can see those mechanical things that hold buildings which can be found in the game etc.
                    >Ok what about this concept art which has that bright zero detail white centric look that you talk about https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq plus the 2018 demo also had this type of look.

The 2018 demo does not have "that kind of look":

[https://youtu.be/sjH48Xs-5OA?si=jTboZXPxUNpYViYf](https://youtu.be/sjH48Xs-5OA?si=jTboZXPxUNpYViYf)

Honestly what are you talking about? There's no bright white zero detail there?

As for your link, I'd love to go through, but Windows is telling me that is not safe. Hopefully he just needs to update his site certificate or something, but mate, I ain't opening that.
                        what do u mean theres no bright white zero detail in the demo? go to the part where V takes sandra to trauma team you can see the bright whites and the part where they overlook the city after taking out the scavenger AV you can see the bright white lighting, or when V is walking up the stairs after the corpo meeting to enter her vehicle you can see that the bright white look, looks the same as the prototype. and there wasnt much detail in that demo it looked too clean and flat. also the link i sent is a false positive, its a devs portfolio
        Can you delete your comment? He was definitely right and you're, well, just wrong.
            Did you respond on the wrong comment?
                Lmfao no. u/kmcwwdfwa_fv324 is right. You're technically wrong. "Did I respond to the wrong comment" lmao. Pretty full of yourself aren't you?
Sure, I mean if it's something common. I don't want to argue or anything.
I played it on a $4,000 PC at launch and it was decisively not fine lol, it only ran great compared to the last-gen console shitshow.
    I played it on a $500 console at launch and it was very fine.
        I played it on PC at release and it was fine also
By looking at it
Remaking tons of animations from first person to fit third person isn't super easy. But yeah I'd also like third person, at least in the sequel game if they can as an option
Mike Pondsmith specifically told them they need to do it in first person.
It’s an engine issue. They were originally making it to be  3rd person but couldn’t figure out the animations so they had to claim it was not immersive enough.
    But the witcher 3 is in 3rd person and use the same engine.

Its clearly a creative decision
        The Witcher 3 also doesn’t have you double jumping, dashing through the air, flying to enemies with a melee lock on, and (before it got scrapped) wall running/latching.  The fast moment to moment gameplay with V flying everywhere is what made the 3rd person view hard for them I suppose, although I do wish we could see our character in 3rd person even if it was only outside combat encounters
            but that's not an engine issue. It is  design decision to NOT make the animations necessary for that perspective.  


there are 3rd person mods that make it possible and you can clearly see the animations were never refined for it.
            > I do wish we could see our character in 3rd person even if it was only outside combat encounters

That’s one of the reasons why I ride a bike everywhere in this game (the other reason being the superior driving mechanics).
            Stop being an arm chair dev lol, your claims have no basis in fact.
                You clearly haven't messed with a late game katana build then because I don't see how any modern game studio could do that kind of combat justice in 3rd person. I don't think you realize how much dev time this would require and how much of our current first person experience would be sacrificed because of it.
                    I'm not saying that it's easy I'm saying he has no claim to what he's saying. What we know is that the devs decided FPP for creative reasons not because they found TPP implementation hard.
            I don't think you understand what "game engine" means.
    "Couldn't figure out the animations" wtf does that even mean? Why state your uninformed speculation as fact?
        especially since they literally said 3 months before the initial release date that they decided to switch to 1st person only for artistic choices.

the initial playthrough of the all foods factory mission has 3rd person sections.
    Somehow I don't think you know very much about any game engine
    This is totally wrong.
except its buggy
    The whole game is buggy
        You're missing the point. The point is that 3rd party implementations tend to not be as polished as official ones. So yeah, there is a 3rd person mod, but it's also shitty as hell.
             No, you’re missing the point. It’s clearly not an engine limitation if third party mods can do it, even with jank.
                Neither of us are missing the point, because the only point Im making is that janky implementations aren't a good substitute. The only way third person would ever be good is in the sequel, because they could have levels designed for third person, they could make all the dialogue interactions in third person, that's what I mean. It's not enough to just make third person, you also need to accommodate the rest of the game for it.
All a modder does is make third person mod, but they don't change the rest of the game to make it work with third person.


Besides, I don't think CDPR ever mentioned it being an engine limitation anyways, it was a design decision, the same way Dark Souls doesn't have toggleable first-person view with difficulty settings, like could you imagine Dark Souls having an easy mode? Lmao that'd be dumb as hell. This is always the biggest of irony of the game industry. We want developers to do what they want instead of listening shareholders or market studies or whatever but then later we go "no your game NEEDS X features" and we make the biggest fucking noise over it.
        every game has bugs
But this is like saying "I hope the actors get to kiss on the DVD release", as if they weren't able to before during filming of a show or movie.
Yes and people are telling you you’re misguided because the engine has nothing to do with that. If they planned on adding third person they would do it regardless of switching engines or not.
    Y’all are so desperate for conflict. It’s literally just me agreeing with the original guy and saying it would be cool. I only brought up the engine cause the next game is literally on a different engine. No other reason.
        I think they are just trying to let you know that even on a different engine, it has nothing to do with whether they make it first or third person or both.
So bringing it up was kind of a mute point, it doesn't change their decision or influence it. They purely made it first person only to focus on things like facial animations and close up detail.
It's not supposed to be a conflict, they are just explaining where the thought process doesn't make sense.
I'd say there are engine limits at play. The game has a huge issue with LOD, pop ins and render distance. 

Definitely not the only factor though
    You’d be wrong. It makes no sense.
It's a prize (?)
Play on PC and spawn as many as you want
I have the exact opposite reaction so don't worry, it balances out.
I suspect it has more to do with gameplay than anything else. By forcing you into one or another, they can focus on combat for that mode instead of trying to make it good for both third and first person.

I honestly can’t think of many games that have good combat in both perspectives.
    >I honestly can’t think of many games that have good combat in both perspectives.

I don't think there's a single one. There are games which switch perspective with different weapons/scopes, like Mass Effect going first-person when you use a sniper scope, and that works fine, but all the Bethesda games play like shit in third person combat and look wonky as fuck too.
        PUBG worked well in both, but that game was never AAA to begin with and it’s mostly because of the good gunplay, being as ADS switched to FPP being the default it wasn’t a difficult transition for most players to switch to FPP only, the benefit being you can’t get peaked behind corners, but pubg killed its playerbase and nothing about this is relevant. 

Recent example though, starfield plays decent in both perspectives, and as someone who mostly prefers third person, the amount I played has all been in FPP
        And even ones that let you switch during gameplay/combat sections will pick one or the other for cutscenes/dialog moments - at least those that involve the player. 

Bethesda titles, for example - you can choose both, but you either get a third person or a first person view when in dialog, depending on the game.

GTAV would later add a first person toggle...but again, all scenes are third person.

Games basically pick one or the other, even if you don't have a choice for gameplay sections. Halo? FPS, switches to third person for cutscenes, and you don't have a choice. Tomb Raider? Third person all the way. CoD? FPS all the way. 

I'm struggling to think of a game that lets you play entirely in first person or third person, while also having the option for scenes to match what you've chosen for gameplay, much less a game that does that and has both options be of good quality.

Not saying it's impossible...but the work (both manpower/hours as well as technical challenges of making both angles look good) involved would be quite the challenge.
    Chivalry does this very well.
Personally, I find first person hugely beneficial for immersion. Red Dead Redemption 2 is my 2nd favorite game of all-time, and I do agree it is more immersive than Cyberpunk in terms of small details and having every action be actually realized by the character.

However, I was still far more immersed in Cyberpunk thank In RDR2 simply because the first person perspective works so well. RDR2 has first person too, but it's rough, and it's far more fun to play in third person.
I don't agree, I feel like cyberpunk is much more immersive than RDR2. RDR2 is more realistic with its interactions and all that, but it's not more immersive. You feel like you are watching a movie about Arthur, whereas with cyberpunk you feel like you are V.
I find first person view in RDR2 to be far more immersive than third person. The game has both views available.
stop the cap, as a gamer FPP is more immersive than TPP for cyberpunk because you can really see the detail in the environment and the tall buildings and intimate moments with characters etc which would lose that effect in TPP
    It'd certainly change the impact of the game a lot. Many of the moments in the game are very much designed around first-person and characters looking at you and each other in a very naturalistic way.

Doing the same scenes with a third-person camera you'd need to shoot them more like film/TV-type scenes (as BG3 and Bioware games do), which can be highly effective, but is extremely different. It does reduce the direct emotional impact - but the upside is it makes some scenes more dramatic because they're so confusing in first person. Jumping/falling for example - in Mass Effect 2 there's a very dramatic jump Shepard (usually) makes, where the shot and music are really effective at conveying just barely making it. In first-person, the jump would *look* pretty easy if you used a reasonable distance, even if you played up barely making it.

You can also use cinematic techniques to do storytelling in third-person that don't really work in first person, but that's a whole long discussion.

Either way, FPP was the right choice for Cyberpunk in the end.
>Having the option to go third person is much more immersive than going to inventory to see your character.

That's not immersion, that's convenience.
As a human who sees the world through eyes positioned in my face and not a camera hovering over my shoulder, first-person is a lot more immersive in games. But I can understand how 3rd person would be more natural for those of you who perceive reality through a drone hovering behind you at all times.
    Being able to go third player occasionally just lets me feel more immersed in the world. Because i can see "me" in the world. I can see where my character is standing, what my character is wearing. etc etc.
If it's always first person it feels more like i'm trapped in a viewport. 

Obviously this is a subjective thing.
Disagree, as a player I find first person more immersive, and having the abilityto go to third person actually breaks my immersion. 

I actually didn't find Skyrim immersive at all, to be honest.
I don't think you know what "immersive" means.
Not making third person allowed them to focus on good FPP combat instead of having the janky hybrid shit Bethesda does
    Surely adding it now was not an option either....
Yes they do, cyberpunk is much more immersirve than say GTA. what's your point?
    GTA 4 is more immersive than Cyberpunk
    GTA never goes for immersion, a more apt comparison is RDR2 which for is infinitely more immersive than Cyberpunk on every conceivable level, a game where 3rd person is the main style of play.

Artstyle, gameplay, animations, small details, NPC AI, and sound design make immersion not a mere perspective change.
        Imagine for a second if portal was third person. It would lose something.
        >RDR2 which for is infinitely more immersive than Cyberpunk on every conceivable level

I think they offer different types of immersion. RDR2 has very detailed graphics and incredible quality game mechanics, but the gameplay feels kinda slow, shooting is less fun, and the jokes are not so edgy. Cyberpunk has, on the other hand, a bit less realistic graphics (although the lighting and cinematic design are at the master level), somehow worse physics (improved in 2.0, but not to the degree of RDR2 or maybe even GTA V), and a bit clunky animations of some NPCs, but the game attracts attention so hard. The world design feels way more unique than in any game, movie or book I've played, seen or read in my life.

And the first-person perspective allowed smooth transitions between cutscenes and the gameplay, which, in my opinion, was a great decision, and contributed a lot to the immersion.
No I don't mean Sandra dorset. 

The original name got moved around, her name was Melissa Rory.....  but watch the trailer, she's dressed exactly the same there as she is here.
    Sorry than, I dont remember her name, not the original one, nor the one she was given in the final game.
        Melissa Rory is actually in the game!

If you go to the corporate clothes shop there is a robbery and max tac shows up. If you scan them, one is Melissa

Those are updated. Most of the CP2077 mod library works again, plug and play.
    I'm using it currently works just fine.
... That's literally what they're asking for? What are you trying to say rn
    They're saying it doesn't exist because it's too generic. Instead we just don't have options? That makes no sense. If the reason is it is too generic, they could just make a design that isn't generic.
        The one depicted *in this video* is generic, not back cyberware as a whole. Not sure how one could reach that conclusion.

Is 20 years too much? Does that change when it's a woman that's older vs a man? Does the lowest age matter? Like is 18/38 worse than 30/50?

I dated a woman that was 20 years older than me, If anything she was the one that left hurt. She was hot and I was coming out of a shitty relationship and just wanted sex. So am I the abuser? Or her for being "predatory" going after someone 20 years younger. Would the situation be different if I was a woman and it was a man? 

Imbalanced power dynamics.. so one person works at Burger King the other is a DA for the city? If they love each other what's the issue?

    no shit its from august 2013, im talking about the first concept art that you linked and another one with a giant robot  which was revealed in may 2012 during the summer conference at cdpr which looked colorful like this and in the final game the same colorfullness can be found in many areas like the afterlife which looks exactly the same as that concept art etc.   


and then theres many other concept arts from pre production which are colorful as well https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/albums/2875189
        The concept art has always been "colourful", sure, including the piece I linked, but that's not "like this" aesthetically.

None of the concept art you've linked looks anything like the extremely bright, zero detail, very white-centric look of this early prototype, which looks like ultra-generic sci-fi or a porn game or something (because it's a prototype, not an intentional aesthetic).

(The most interesting think about that James Daly link is that his stuff looks more similar to Cyberpunk 2020 than what we actually got in the end - it's pretty cool.)
            Ok what about this concept art which has that bright zero detail white centric look that you talk about [https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq](https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq) plus the 2018 demo also had this type of look.  


not really the concept art on that james created look like what we have in the game [https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/projects/18Wgo2?album\_id=2875189](https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/projects/18Wgo2?album_id=2875189) the second image looks exactly like heywood in the final game same brick buildings, at the bottom you can see those mechanical things that hold buildings which can be found in the game etc.

The 2018 demo does not have "that kind of look":

Honestly what are you talking about? There's no bright white zero detail there?

As for your link, I'd love to go through, but Windows is telling me that is not safe. Hopefully he just needs to update his site certificate or something, but mate, I ain't opening that.
                    what do u mean theres no bright white zero detail in the demo? go to the part where V takes sandra to trauma team you can see the bright whites and the part where they overlook the city after taking out the scavenger AV you can see the bright white lighting, or when V is walking up the stairs after the corpo meeting to enter her vehicle you can see that the bright white look, looks the same as the prototype. and there wasnt much detail in that demo it looked too clean and flat. also the link i sent is a false positive, its a devs portfolio
    Can you delete your comment? He was definitely right and you're, well, just wrong.
        Did you respond on the wrong comment?
            Lmfao no. u/kmcwwdfwa_fv324 is right. You're technically wrong. "Did I respond to the wrong comment" lmao. Pretty full of yourself aren't you?
I played it on a $500 console at launch and it was very fine.
    I played it on PC at release and it was fine also
But the witcher 3 is in 3rd person and use the same engine.

Its clearly a creative decision
    The Witcher 3 also doesn’t have you double jumping, dashing through the air, flying to enemies with a melee lock on, and (before it got scrapped) wall running/latching.  The fast moment to moment gameplay with V flying everywhere is what made the 3rd person view hard for them I suppose, although I do wish we could see our character in 3rd person even if it was only outside combat encounters
        but that's not an engine issue. It is  design decision to NOT make the animations necessary for that perspective.  


there are 3rd person mods that make it possible and you can clearly see the animations were never refined for it.
        > I do wish we could see our character in 3rd person even if it was only outside combat encounters

That’s one of the reasons why I ride a bike everywhere in this game (the other reason being the superior driving mechanics).
        Stop being an arm chair dev lol, your claims have no basis in fact.
            You clearly haven't messed with a late game katana build then because I don't see how any modern game studio could do that kind of combat justice in 3rd person. I don't think you realize how much dev time this would require and how much of our current first person experience would be sacrificed because of it.
                I'm not saying that it's easy I'm saying he has no claim to what he's saying. What we know is that the devs decided FPP for creative reasons not because they found TPP implementation hard.
        I don't think you understand what "game engine" means.
"Couldn't figure out the animations" wtf does that even mean? Why state your uninformed speculation as fact?
    especially since they literally said 3 months before the initial release date that they decided to switch to 1st person only for artistic choices.

the initial playthrough of the all foods factory mission has 3rd person sections.
Somehow I don't think you know very much about any game engine
This is totally wrong.
The whole game is buggy
    You're missing the point. The point is that 3rd party implementations tend to not be as polished as official ones. So yeah, there is a 3rd person mod, but it's also shitty as hell.
         No, you’re missing the point. It’s clearly not an engine limitation if third party mods can do it, even with jank.
            Neither of us are missing the point, because the only point Im making is that janky implementations aren't a good substitute. The only way third person would ever be good is in the sequel, because they could have levels designed for third person, they could make all the dialogue interactions in third person, that's what I mean. It's not enough to just make third person, you also need to accommodate the rest of the game for it.
All a modder does is make third person mod, but they don't change the rest of the game to make it work with third person.


Besides, I don't think CDPR ever mentioned it being an engine limitation anyways, it was a design decision, the same way Dark Souls doesn't have toggleable first-person view with difficulty settings, like could you imagine Dark Souls having an easy mode? Lmao that'd be dumb as hell. This is always the biggest of irony of the game industry. We want developers to do what they want instead of listening shareholders or market studies or whatever but then later we go "no your game NEEDS X features" and we make the biggest fucking noise over it.
    every game has bugs
Y’all are so desperate for conflict. It’s literally just me agreeing with the original guy and saying it would be cool. I only brought up the engine cause the next game is literally on a different engine. No other reason.
    I think they are just trying to let you know that even on a different engine, it has nothing to do with whether they make it first or third person or both.
So bringing it up was kind of a mute point, it doesn't change their decision or influence it. They purely made it first person only to focus on things like facial animations and close up detail.
It's not supposed to be a conflict, they are just explaining where the thought process doesn't make sense.
You’d be wrong. It makes no sense.
>I honestly can’t think of many games that have good combat in both perspectives.

I don't think there's a single one. There are games which switch perspective with different weapons/scopes, like Mass Effect going first-person when you use a sniper scope, and that works fine, but all the Bethesda games play like shit in third person combat and look wonky as fuck too.
    PUBG worked well in both, but that game was never AAA to begin with and it’s mostly because of the good gunplay, being as ADS switched to FPP being the default it wasn’t a difficult transition for most players to switch to FPP only, the benefit being you can’t get peaked behind corners, but pubg killed its playerbase and nothing about this is relevant. 

Recent example though, starfield plays decent in both perspectives, and as someone who mostly prefers third person, the amount I played has all been in FPP
    And even ones that let you switch during gameplay/combat sections will pick one or the other for cutscenes/dialog moments - at least those that involve the player. 

Bethesda titles, for example - you can choose both, but you either get a third person or a first person view when in dialog, depending on the game.

GTAV would later add a first person toggle...but again, all scenes are third person.

Games basically pick one or the other, even if you don't have a choice for gameplay sections. Halo? FPS, switches to third person for cutscenes, and you don't have a choice. Tomb Raider? Third person all the way. CoD? FPS all the way. 

I'm struggling to think of a game that lets you play entirely in first person or third person, while also having the option for scenes to match what you've chosen for gameplay, much less a game that does that and has both options be of good quality.

Not saying it's impossible...but the work (both manpower/hours as well as technical challenges of making both angles look good) involved would be quite the challenge.
Chivalry does this very well.
It'd certainly change the impact of the game a lot. Many of the moments in the game are very much designed around first-person and characters looking at you and each other in a very naturalistic way.

Doing the same scenes with a third-person camera you'd need to shoot them more like film/TV-type scenes (as BG3 and Bioware games do), which can be highly effective, but is extremely different. It does reduce the direct emotional impact - but the upside is it makes some scenes more dramatic because they're so confusing in first person. Jumping/falling for example - in Mass Effect 2 there's a very dramatic jump Shepard (usually) makes, where the shot and music are really effective at conveying just barely making it. In first-person, the jump would *look* pretty easy if you used a reasonable distance, even if you played up barely making it.

You can also use cinematic techniques to do storytelling in third-person that don't really work in first person, but that's a whole long discussion.

Either way, FPP was the right choice for Cyberpunk in the end.
Being able to go third player occasionally just lets me feel more immersed in the world. Because i can see "me" in the world. I can see where my character is standing, what my character is wearing. etc etc.
If it's always first person it feels more like i'm trapped in a viewport. 

Obviously this is a subjective thing.
Surely adding it now was not an option either....
GTA 4 is more immersive than Cyberpunk
GTA never goes for immersion, a more apt comparison is RDR2 which for is infinitely more immersive than Cyberpunk on every conceivable level, a game where 3rd person is the main style of play.

Artstyle, gameplay, animations, small details, NPC AI, and sound design make immersion not a mere perspective change.
    Imagine for a second if portal was third person. It would lose something.
    >RDR2 which for is infinitely more immersive than Cyberpunk on every conceivable level

I think they offer different types of immersion. RDR2 has very detailed graphics and incredible quality game mechanics, but the gameplay feels kinda slow, shooting is less fun, and the jokes are not so edgy. Cyberpunk has, on the other hand, a bit less realistic graphics (although the lighting and cinematic design are at the master level), somehow worse physics (improved in 2.0, but not to the degree of RDR2 or maybe even GTA V), and a bit clunky animations of some NPCs, but the game attracts attention so hard. The world design feels way more unique than in any game, movie or book I've played, seen or read in my life.

And the first-person perspective allowed smooth transitions between cutscenes and the gameplay, which, in my opinion, was a great decision, and contributed a lot to the immersion.
Sorry than, I dont remember her name, not the original one, nor the one she was given in the final game.
    Melissa Rory is actually in the game!

If you go to the corporate clothes shop there is a robbery and max tac shows up. If you scan them, one is Melissa
I know right? I'm fine with the dog and mom stuff but the sister is is just to far

What a CyberDouche
Every time I see that thread, it's uploaded somewhere else but has the exact same comments and everything.

Fuckin' bots, I swear.
Mods only got outdated because the big dependency mods all the others plug into were fucked by the patch...for about a week.

Those are updated. Most of the CP2077 mod library works again, plug and play.
I'm using it currently works just fine.
They're saying it doesn't exist because it's too generic. Instead we just don't have options? That makes no sense. If the reason is it is too generic, they could just make a design that isn't generic.
    The one depicted *in this video* is generic, not back cyberware as a whole. Not sure how one could reach that conclusion.
    Are you doing ok?
I exclusively ride motorcycles, I prob see my back more than I see my face.
I literally never see my face, yet there's a lot of facewear/helmets/hats what's your point?
    Must be hard not using your inventory...
I think 3rd person was always the intend, but 1srt turned out very well at least. Yep, I would kill for the option, and yes, a Bethesda approach where you decide which camera to use is so cool, specifically in a role playing game, "see the world through your protagonist or see how it becomes one"
[deleted]
    Yeah people need to relax a little... sometimes people fall in love with each other because they are good for one another. It doesn't get more complicated than that.
        [deleted]
            No, I'm pointing out that what you are so worried about is not always the case. I think you just made my point to be honest.

People want to be so afraid it is always happening, they can't relax enough to understand that it is not always happening.
            What is an inappropriate age gap?

Is 20 years too much? Does that change when it's a woman that's older vs a man? Does the lowest age matter? Like is 18/38 worse than 30/50?

I dated a woman that was 20 years older than me, If anything she was the one that left hurt. She was hot and I was coming out of a shitty relationship and just wanted sex. So am I the abuser? Or her for being "predatory" going after someone 20 years younger. Would the situation be different if I was a woman and it was a man? 

Imbalanced power dynamics.. so one person works at Burger King the other is a DA for the city? If they love each other what's the issue? 

Grooming? Yeah that's clearly wrong. That's someone taking all the things you just mentioned and using it in a manipulative way. Intentions are what matter. Unfortunately bad intentions exist even without anything you mentioned.

Besides, I don't think CDPR ever mentioned it being an engine limitation anyways, it was a design decision, the same way Dark Souls doesn't have toggleable first-person view with difficulty settings, like could you imagine Dark Souls having an easy mode? Lmao that'd be dumb as hell. This is always the biggest of irony of the game industry. We want developers to do what they want instead of listening shareholders or market studies or whatever but then later we go "no your game NEEDS X features" and we make the biggest fucking noise over it.

    No, I'm pointing out that what you are so worried about is not always the case. I think you just made my point to be honest.

People want to be so afraid it is always happening, they can't relax enough to understand that it is not always happening.
    What is an inappropriate age gap?

Is 20 years too much? Does that change when it's a woman that's older vs a man? Does the lowest age matter? Like is 18/38 worse than 30/50?

I dated a woman that was 20 years older than me, If anything she was the one that left hurt. She was hot and I was coming out of a shitty relationship and just wanted sex. So am I the abuser? Or her for being "predatory" going after someone 20 years younger. Would the situation be different if I was a woman and it was a man? 

Imbalanced power dynamics.. so one person works at Burger King the other is a DA for the city? If they love each other what's the issue? 

Grooming? Yeah that's clearly wrong. That's someone taking all the things you just mentioned and using it in a manipulative way. Intentions are what matter. Unfortunately bad intentions exist even without anything you mentioned.
#ROCK!
    AAAAAHHHHHHHH
Ok what about this concept art which has that bright zero detail white centric look that you talk about [https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq](https://www.paulchadeisson.com/projects/ELXnlq) plus the 2018 demo also had this type of look.  


not really the concept art on that james created look like what we have in the game [https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/projects/18Wgo2?album\_id=2875189](https://jamesdaly.artstation.com/projects/18Wgo2?album_id=2875189) the second image looks exactly like heywood in the final game same brick buildings, at the bottom you can see those mechanical things that hold buildings which can be found in the game etc.

The 2018 demo does not have "that kind of look":

Honestly what are you talking about? There's no bright white zero detail there?

As for your link, I'd love to go through, but Windows is telling me that is not safe. Hopefully he just needs to update his site certificate or something, but mate, I ain't opening that.
        what do u mean theres no bright white zero detail in the demo? go to the part where V takes sandra to trauma team you can see the bright whites and the part where they overlook the city after taking out the scavenger AV you can see the bright white lighting, or when V is walking up the stairs after the corpo meeting to enter her vehicle you can see that the bright white look, looks the same as the prototype. and there wasnt much detail in that demo it looked too clean and flat. also the link i sent is a false positive, its a devs portfolio
Lmfao no. u/kmcwwdfwa_fv324 is right. You're technically wrong. "Did I respond to the wrong comment" lmao. Pretty full of yourself aren't you?
You clearly haven't messed with a late game katana build then because I don't see how any modern game studio could do that kind of combat justice in 3rd person. I don't think you realize how much dev time this would require and how much of our current first person experience would be sacrificed because of it.
    I'm not saying that it's easy I'm saying he has no claim to what he's saying. What we know is that the devs decided FPP for creative reasons not because they found TPP implementation hard.
Neither of us are missing the point, because the only point Im making is that janky implementations aren't a good substitute. The only way third person would ever be good is in the sequel, because they could have levels designed for third person, they could make all the dialogue interactions in third person, that's what I mean. It's not enough to just make third person, you also need to accommodate the rest of the game for it.
