[[Keanu Reeves looks badass in Cyberpunk 2077.]]





How did this not leak. I'm so happy.
    It *almost* did. A French site apparently saw someone from a distance in a suit with black shaggy hair and assumed it was Miyamoto and “leaked” it like an hour or two before E3. Turns out it was Keanu.
        I’m so glad this didn’t leak, our whole group viewing collectively screamed when we saw him
            Surprise Keanu got everyone hyped as fuck.
            I stopped paying attention after the first title shot.  Caught me sleeping until The One told me to wake tf up cuz it aint over yet.
        Thank god the french don't know people
            Thanks for the laugh friend
        Seriously?  What the hell is wrong with people?  Why run the surprise?
    It just sounds so ridiculous, who would believe it lol "Keanu Reeves... is in Cyberpunk 2077...?"
        Given that Keanu starred in a reasonably popular Cyberpunk-esque film; The Matrix, I don't think it's particularly outlandish?
            Also a reasonably unpopular one called Johnny Mnemonic.
                One of the reasons he did the Matrix was because of his Johhny Pneumonic character, which was essentially just a continuation of the character with a different name and backstory. They share so many things, and personally I think that movie is underrated, it was a good film with great staging and set design.

                        This one's comin' at chu... low tech style.
                            Loop that shit (dolphin begins splashing around)
                        I vaguely remember seeing this when I was younger. I don’t remember it being as bad as everyone says it is, guess its rewind time.
                        well it was written by the founder of cyberpunk soooooooooooo..........

                        Honestly, that's not that far off from modern day VR, at least from the control scheme.
                            For some reason hacking in the 80's was just watching a bunch of stupid bad cgi puzzles and locked doors. because they obviously were going to be visually represented as doors and not characters on a screen.

edit: Can't forget the nuclear silo noises either.
                    Welcome to Beijing, Johnny
                heh - i kind of enjoyed that movie actually.   It's hilarious that back then 80GB was just "soooo much data"  now we keep double that in our pockets for fun. 

I mean, I have around 50TB sitting on my desk right now, lol
                That was also created by the father of cyberpunk William Gibson
                Isn't it considered a cult classic now? If it isn't, then it should. Just look at it. We have Keanu, Ice-T, Takeshi Kitano, Dolph Lundgren and Henry Rollins in a 90:s cyberpunk action film written by William Gibson. It's perfect.
            > reasonably popular
    I worked on the broadcast.  I knew about Keanu about 5 days ago and we used a code name for him.  It was so hard for me not to tell everyone but, you know, NDAs are scary.
        WHAT WAS THE CODE NAME?
            Mr.  Fusion.
                Thanks for answering, and sorry for yelling. Thought you were just gonna vanish and not tell us the code name :)
                    No worries!
        You did the Lord’s work, son.
    Kinda sucks they put him in the thumbnail tho

                    i need to watch this again.

that and virtuosity.

the 90s was the best goddamn decade for movies.
                        Dude, watch Hackers again.  One of my fav movies of all time cuz it's so cringe (and Jolie was still sexy AF).

"Look at this machine!  It's got a 24.4kbps modem!!!!"
                            its 14.4kbps as a matter of fact.

ive seen hackers more times that i can count my friend.
                                Nah, it's "28.8 bps modem". Not kbps, just bps.

https://youtu.be/UEb4I5y93uA
                                    shit.

i stand corrected. and i own this movie on vhs dvd and bluray.
                                    These days I wouldn't bother with 28.8Mbps. :(
                            Hackers is one of my fav movies. It’s terrible but wonderful at the same time. I was active in the hacking scene back then and as much as everyone tried to hate it for being so stupid I’m pretty sure everyone actually secretly loved it. It was like bubblegum cyberpunk... a one movie genre. It also had an era defining soundtrack that actually did electronic music right. It and The Saint and Strange Days killed the 90’s soundtrack game.

It was also peak Jolie. Good god my 16 year old loins.
                                That haircut kills it for me
                            >(and Jolie was still sexy AF).

I say the same thing and people scoff at me! :D
                        Excuse me, the 80’s would like to have a word with you...
                            you can fuck right off with that argument.

the 80s pales in comparison to the 90's. although i do admit that they are the closest thing to a second place that is presently around.
                                I don’t know man, Blade Runner, Dune, Terminator, Outland, Aliens, The Abyss, They Live, Amira, Patlabor, Predator, Robocop, Repo Man, Real Genius, The Last Starfighter, Ghostbusters, Brainstorm, Tron, Empire and Jedi, Escape From NY, and Spaceballs just mention a few... I’m sticking with the 80’s.
                                    The Running Man, as well.
                                    The 80’s absolutely fucking dominate the 90’s in terms of movies and music. The 90’s were a cultural deadzone/transition period between analog and digital. The 80’s were the analog era perfected.
                                    I agree. The 80s was amazing. The whole decade was a fucked up and weird time... For everything.
                                Lol what planet are you on. 90s is good but 80s will always be the king
                                I would say they are almost equal.  Back To The Future is probably my favorite film of all time...but I'm a 90's boy and I will never forget being around when Jurassic Park was in cinemas, I was 7, so the 90's win as far as I'm concerned!.
                                    [what was that about the 80's again?](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?release_date=1990,1999&title_type=feature)

you cant fuck with that list of movies.
                    Star Trek got around that by using a fictional measurement. They measured data in quads rather than bytes.
                    Moores law doesnt say anything about storage, AND the whole point of data couriers was that networking wasn't secure.
                    They probably just wanted it to make sense to the audience.
                    It was done for the audience. People knew what a gigabyte was. They used a language the audience understands.
            replace the g with a t, and it could still be impressive. i mean, we do i have 1 tb microsd cards now, but shoving 320 of those up your nose is still going to be hard.
                The rectum is more elastic than a nose, just saying.
                    "I'm gonna need you to store this data way up your butt, Johnny. WAAAAAAY up your butt!"
                        ...buurp

And a new hobby it sounds like...
            It’s OK he’s got that ram double software!
            When i was a kid my friend told me that he read about some rich dude who bought some custom made hdd with 10gb, i didnt believe him, my PC was 386 with 40mb or 60mb hdd :-)
        The character Keanu plays in cyberpunk is fittingly called Jonny Silverhand (which is an actual character from the lore).
        Don't worry, John Wick says "We're all Breathtaking".

                That honestly made me giggle a little. He was obviously addressing me as well.
        Id totally eat his ass
            I'd let him put a bullet in me
    omg have you seen him in Always Be My Maybe? He plays a hilarious egotistical caricature of himself.
        > $6400 on dinner

> Calls them an Uber Pool

It was definitely on purpose.
        His best role since Bill and Ted.  He needs to do more comedies.
        Watched it last weekend I had no idea he was in that movie and I loved him!
    A look of someone very familiar with Chinese dignitaries.
    My comment exactly.
Keanu would look badass doing his taxes... With a f**king pencil.
    You gave him a fucking pencil!!

We’re all dead.
    > With a f**king pencil.

*pencyil
        My bad.
     I mean it would be pretty badass for him to do his taxes himself considering how complicated it is for pretty much anyone of his income level. Not to mention by hand

    From all the _John Wick_ comments, I get the impression that there aren't all that many of us that have read [William Gibson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson) books, played [Cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020) when it first came out, or remember [Johnny Mnemonic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113481/). 

All he really wanted was [room service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1okpAj7Fhw&feature=youtu.be&t=62).
        And a $10,000 a night hooker.
        God I love this movie. 

If you *are* the type that’s read a bunch of Gibson and played the old R. Talsorian pen and paper then it makes perfect sense out of the gate. 

If you haven’t, it’s just a confusing jumble of “what the fuck? Wait, what? Why? He’s doubling himself, the shit does that mean? The yakuza is the most powerful crime syndicate in Newark?”
        I don't know why, it just feels so sad reading how Johnny dies in Neuromancer.
            Might just be me, but I feel that Johnny was our way in to the world. We were always with him, but then the his story ended. Time passes and we found ourselves with a different character, progressing through the same world...and we heard that our previously close friend had died alone.

(it's been ages since I read the Sprawl trilogy)
        Well, he is A Johnny: https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Johnny_Silverhand
            He goes by that name quite a lot...

Johnny Utah - Point Break  
Jonathan Harker - Bram Stroker's Dracula  
Johnny Mnemonic  
John Constantine
John - Generation Um...  
John Wick  
Johnny Silverhand  
He's even working on a new TV series called Rain where  he plays...John Rain.
                John is the most common name in the english language. Calling your character that name or some variation of it is a shorthand for an everyman or someone mild mannered.
        Should we read this and play the game before playing the new one?
        >	played Cyberpunk when it first came out

I loved the Cyberpunk setting but R-Tal’s mechanics were almost as frustrating as Palladium.
        I still say, "He's that guy....that fucked your mother" whenever anyone asks who someone is.
    His character ingame is called "Jonny Silverhand" as well. Kind of fitting and it's not just running of Johnny Mnemonic and John Wick name, Jonny Silverhand is an actual character in the cyberpunk lore.
        A fyookin' pincil!
    How do you pronounce Mnemonic? Trying to say that out loud sends my tongue through a labyrinth of impossible paths and twirls.
        Neh (like eh. Or meh)

Mon (like poke-mon)

Ic (like ick or sick)
        Just pretend the first m doesn't exist. It's silent, like the P in pterodactyl.
    Underrated comment.
Wait is he the villain of the game, because I don't think I can hurt him.
    He's Johnny Silverhand. So assuming you are against the corps and the corrupt system, basically THE good guy.
        Until they do a twist and you give the keys to completely shutting down the system but also possibly killing loads of people to Keanu. Then you gotta stop him even though you really don't want to.
            So basically Cyberpunk's version of Frank Fontaine?
            hopefully not
        Wait, cue me in. Is he an existing character? What do we know about him so far?
            He was one of the original characters mentioned in the OG 2020 rulebook. In the gameplay trailer, the music V wakes up to is "Chippin in" by Johnny Silverhand. Check the wiki if you want to know about him.
    Open world rpg so you can probably be a bad guy to. Bad guy buddies with Jonny SilverReeves? Yes please...
    He's a hologram, the character if still alive would be in his 60s but he's probably dead. You can see him flicker but the world around doesn't flicker
        Well in 2020 Johnny's ex Alt developed a program to copy persona and store them in the net, theoretically this could have been used on Johnny himself as Alt has been a similar ghost since she was murdered by her own software.

And in the first trailer they remark that he had recently died.
            Unless he isn't actually as dead as reported due to sneaky bullshit instead of cheating an execution.
        That is possible. It is also possible this is an alternate Cyberpunk world where he would be his younger self. Or he could even not be there in reality and is an AR overlay from a Netrunner for various reasons.
        To be accurate, Reeves is almost in his 60s too...
    Kill the guy you send to kill the Boogeyman?

Impossible.
How am I supposed to play this game with a massive erection?

    One handed gaming
CD Projekt Red won E3 just by having John Wick in their game.
    Really genuine studio, don't have may of those around.
        Aside from the terrible treatment of workers and whatnot.
            You're supposed to explain why you gave a contrasted opinion when most people believe that they are genuine salt of the earth people.
                I'm busy so I don't really have a ton of time to go into it. Former employees from the witcher 3 development have stated however that the conditions were very tiresome and a lot was expected in short amounts of time and moral was very low. They have released a statement that for cyberpunk they are aiming to make the conditions more "humane" so they do deserve credit for improving. But its unfair to say they're completely genuine.
                    Dude, that’s software development as a whole...
                        [deleted]
                            Fair enough. Good on them for recognizing the poor conditions and trying to address it. I hadn’t heard that before so I appreciate you pointing it out
                                Crunch is an issue in pretty much the entire gaming industry
                                No worries
                        not true. All my coding jobs have been cushy, I didn’t even need to finish school. The difference between my working environment and nearly any other job that isn’t union-controlled is demand for my labor. Most jobs have surplus potential workers and American industry shaves ever more profit out of them, pushing at every regulation as much as they can. Somebody can always replace them.

Gaming is like this because there is exceptional extra supply for that labor. Because it’s gaming. 

What other parts of the software development world treat their employees terribly the way they do in gaming? Everyone I know in software (besides the gaming industry people I know) would bounce pretty quickly if they were forced into crunch like that. Unless they had really good stock options and could quit after a soon to come payday.
                            There isn't long term crunch like the gaming industry but there is definitely still plenty in tech, especially when you factor in startups. Another example: SpaceX
                        Completely wrong to generalize but ok. Just cause every game studio does it doesn't mean they can. If they want to be a genuine studio maybe stop treating like trash the people that make it possible, the devs and designers
                        Please don't. It is a genuine problem and just writing it off as a major issue with ALL development is bullshit. Witcher 3 is one of my favorite games ever, but they make good use of cheap Polish labor. Also software development in general is not bad, it is game development where shit is pretty terrible.
                        Game development is notoriously the hardest conditions in terms of software dev.
                        That's definitely not true. Maybe for game software development, but in regular software, it varies company by company and team by team.
                        Being part of an industry-wide problem might not be unexpected, but hand-waving it away like that is how this stuff gets normalised in the first place.
                            I think the point is more that it's hard to shit on them when it IS normalised already.

At least they're trying to do something about it.
                        That doesn’t make it right. The fuck?
            Typical fanboys downvote you to 0 when even CD admitted to poor treatment of their workers. They are working to improve but calling them a "genuine" studio when they have this in their recent past is disingenuous.
            In what ways?
                Massive amount of crunch. Of course, it's a standard these days but that doesn't mean it's good.
                    CD Project Red my friend, me downvote you because me like CD Project Red
    I didn’t think they could make a game better than the Witcher 3, but then they added Keanu Reeves
    For real. And it’s one of the best large studios out there. This game is going to set fucking records
        But what about sales records?
    To be fair they arent the first. Payday 2 also has John Wick in their game. The problem is that its not Keanu Reeves proper.

There are two things I love in life: CD Projekt RED and Keanu Reevs....
2020 is gonna be a good year.
At first I was like "alright, trailer looks okay, more of the same of what we saw in the demo, nothing too exciting", then this scene starts and I'm like "holy fuck, is that Johnny Silverhand? Holy shit, fuck yes", then he takes off the glasses and I'm like "huh, he looks a lot like Keanu Reeves…wait…no way…oh fuck, that's totally him" and then they have him come on stage and I just cannot adequately describe how much of my shit I lost in those 20 or so seconds that all of this happened in.
    He was not prepared for the fans in that audience and that makes it 100% better.
    >I'm like "holy fuck, is that Johnny Silverhand? 

Wait, how do people already know of Silverhand if the game isn't out? Is there some other story giving background lore or something?
        Cyberpunk 2077 is based on the tabletop rpg Cyberpunk 2020 so alot of the lore like Johnny silver hand comes directly from the tabletop.
            Thank you. I thought it was just a name the internet gave him.
            I'm genuinely surprised at how many people have no idea this is based off of a Pen & Paper RPG.  But that goes to show how popular CD Projekt Red is.
    I believe the term you are looking for is "fangasm".
Johnny Silverhand!
Baba Yaga!!

This caught me completely off guard! So fucking awesome!!!
    I have only said "Is that Keanu Reeves?!" twice in my life.

Keanu Reeves will be finally immortal after Cyberpunk 2077 release.
I had absolutely no expectations for anything crazy from the Microsoft presser... as soon as I saw this and Keanu walked out I was fanboying haha. Made me feel emotions I forgot I had!
They actually used progressive aging software to accurately depict his appearance in the year 2077.

It’s honestly breathtaking. You’re breathtaking. ...loud chuckle..... Thank you
Johnny silverhand!!!
When has he ever didn't look badass?
    Bill and Ted
Is this porn on YouTube?
Johnny Silverhand?
He’s Breathtaking
Sorry think you meant Baba Yaga looks badass.
If he doesn't once say "most excellent" I'm gonna be so disappointed.
It’s a cinematic trailer though
Keanu always looks bad ass.
That's not just Keanu. That's Johnny Silverhand!
I believe he's just 'meh'. I just don't get the whole hype about him. Yeah he may be a cool guy, idk, but it's just too much of him everywhere recently.
 Whatever it takes. I will kill people with Keanu. One playthrough will be best buddies with Keanu! Lets go John Wick my man!
New circlejerk, oh goodie
OP just screenshotted the trailer and posted it again for Karma
    Lmao getting downvoted for speaking the truth

Cyberwick 2077
Did not see that comming.
Actually cyberpunk 2077 looks badass with Keanu Reeves
Neo never left the Matrix 😢
I know Kungfuu... and Gunfuu
He always looks badass
To be fair when does he not look badass?
‘Scuse you, what do you think gives you the right to say that he looks bad ass in Cyberpunk? He looks bad ass all the damn time
Is he reprising his role from Jonny Neumonic?
He's breath-taking.
That may have been one of the best things I've seen in all the years I've been watching these press conferences.
You mean “Keanu Reeves looks bad ass” period.
He looks breathtaking.
Remember, no pre-or... fuck it i'll throw all the money they want
He looks badass in general
I just commented so there wouldn't be 699 comments
Honestly, putting a celebrity in the game feels pretty tacky. I still have high hopes for this game tho
Of course the Ageless One will look the same in 2077.
Next April panties will drop.
I bet you can get him as a romance-able character.
Considering the robotic arm, does this make him... The Wick-er Soldier?
They if an enemy kills a dog in the game, John Wick appears and kills them
Is anyone else getting annoyed at actors' likeness being used in-game? I have no problem with getting super famous actors to come in and do voice work, but for me, this is somehow crossing the line.

Like, obviously Cyberpunk 2077 was going to sell like freshly baked bread in a medieval village, and now it's just going to sell even more. But shouldn't the game be able to stand on its own two legs without this kind of marketing gimmick?

Same thing goes for Dead Stranding. Before the latest trailer, did we know *anything* about what kind of game it would be? (Do we even know that much more now?) No, not really. But people got excited as shit, and I think most of that was because of the actors attached to it, more than anything else.

Not saying it's an entirely bad thing, but I am personally more than a little annoyed by it.

^I ^am ^prepared ^for ^the ^downvotes ^to ^roll ^in.
    I totally agree - I'll sink with you brother!
This man does not need a bionic arm when we know he can kill someone with a pencil.
John Wick Armor pack coming to Witcher 3 confirmed
Bloody hell the grammar on people these days.

Looking his normal ageless self.

Wonder if he is the dude singing on the Radio when Johnny Silverhand's band plays.

I'm re-watching the gameplay preview from last year but I can't tell for sure.
YOU’RE ALL BREATHTAKING
[All I could think of is punching Keanu Reeves.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39afwW8fp3w)
You mean Robo-Wick...
Spoiler alert plz!
"You killed my robot dog, now i must kill you"
this is so sick
I\`m gonna have wet dreams for the rest of the week.
This man is not human, how can  a person be this liked and badass I can not fathom it.
It's only a model...
Who touched his futuristic doggo?
did they remake him 100% for them game or did they model the character from his real face?
Babayaga himself.
Where does he not ?
It would be awesome if the character is a huge John Wick fan in the future. Take the story element of obsessive modification and whatnot to fanboy status. He chose to look like Keanu.
Everyone liked that
IS\* badass !
He killed three men in a bar with a fookin' pencil!
Am I the only one that can see John wick here?
He would look good in a gender swap snapchat. Of course he looks good in cyberpunk!
If we have him as a companion, he will literally complete the game for you.
Yeah
2077? Further evidence he's immortal.
We are in the golden age of Keanu.
Lol, he looks like that guy from John Wick.
he knows kung fu.
He is da man
Keanu Reeves looks badass
So this is how Keanu becomes immortal.
Considering how he doesn’t age, I assume he will look exactly like that in real-life 2077
He a bout to kill someone wth that robo cuz someone killed his robot dog
I hope he plays a big part in the story
Hoping he'll look good in-game as well.
Johnny Mnemonic lives.
I wonder if it is game over if you kill his dog or will he just relentlessly kill you over and over again across multiple reloads?
"...Yeah."
whoaw..
He's already badass.
Just by having that man, they will sell millions.
It's John Fortnite!

If I had any reservations on Cyberpunk2077 before, it had all gone through the window the moment I saw his magnificent face.
Keanu Reeves is now an e-boy!
Anyone else get the feeling that Keanu Reeves is a big ass nerd like all of us and he's lurking right now with a smile on his face when he sees this?
Oh  man oh man I just can’t wait

Sorry, what he meant was “Keanu Reeves is badass”
I like to think that Keanu Reeves isn't in Cyberpunk,  


John Wick is.
This isnt a photo from the game.. This IS Keanu from 2077.  Hasn't aged a day
Keanu Reeves looks badass in *fill in whatever he is in most recently here*
Kinda looks like my man Dutch Van Derline
This looked so fucking good.
WAIT WHAT? KEANU REEVES IN CYBERPUNK 2077? INSTANT BUY
No, he looks breathtaking
Is he going to be in the tutorial for ten minutes or through the whole thing?
Yeah, this was going to be an auto-buy for me after Witcher3 and the fact that I like future dystopia more than fantasy...then a wyld Keanu appears and awesome! Crazy how this didn't leak for what I can only assume is years.
I'm so fucking happy holy shit! Keanu Reaves baby!!

 Keanu Reeves looks badass ~~in Cyberpunk 2077.~~
Pretty sure he looks badass because they filled in the patchy beard and made it whole.
Keanu Reeves just looks badass in general.
I just don't understand the trend of actors in games. We got walking dead crossbow guy in Death Stranding and now Keanu Reeves in Cyberpunk. Is it just to draw people in?
Is pencil a weapon?
It *almost* did. A French site apparently saw someone from a distance in a suit with black shaggy hair and assumed it was Miyamoto and “leaked” it like an hour or two before E3. Turns out it was Keanu.
    I’m so glad this didn’t leak, our whole group viewing collectively screamed when we saw him
        Surprise Keanu got everyone hyped as fuck.
        I stopped paying attention after the first title shot.  Caught me sleeping until The One told me to wake tf up cuz it aint over yet.
    Thank god the french don't know people
        Thanks for the laugh friend
    Seriously?  What the hell is wrong with people?  Why run the surprise?
It just sounds so ridiculous, who would believe it lol "Keanu Reeves... is in Cyberpunk 2077...?"
    Given that Keanu starred in a reasonably popular Cyberpunk-esque film; The Matrix, I don't think it's particularly outlandish?
        Also a reasonably unpopular one called Johnny Mnemonic.
            One of the reasons he did the Matrix was because of his Johhny Pneumonic character, which was essentially just a continuation of the character with a different name and backstory. They share so many things, and personally I think that movie is underrated, it was a good film with great staging and set design.

                    I vaguely remember seeing this when I was younger. I don’t remember it being as bad as everyone says it is, guess its rewind time.
                    well it was written by the founder of cyberpunk soooooooooooo..........
                [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzRjtvMQds4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzRjtvMQds4)
                    Honestly, that's not that far off from modern day VR, at least from the control scheme.
                        For some reason hacking in the 80's was just watching a bunch of stupid bad cgi puzzles and locked doors. because they obviously were going to be visually represented as doors and not characters on a screen.

edit: Can't forget the nuclear silo noises either.
                Welcome to Beijing, Johnny
            heh - i kind of enjoyed that movie actually.   It's hilarious that back then 80GB was just "soooo much data"  now we keep double that in our pockets for fun. 

I mean, I have around 50TB sitting on my desk right now, lol
            That was also created by the father of cyberpunk William Gibson
            Isn't it considered a cult classic now? If it isn't, then it should. Just look at it. We have Keanu, Ice-T, Takeshi Kitano, Dolph Lundgren and Henry Rollins in a 90:s cyberpunk action film written by William Gibson. It's perfect.
        > reasonably popular
I worked on the broadcast.  I knew about Keanu about 5 days ago and we used a code name for him.  It was so hard for me not to tell everyone but, you know, NDAs are scary.
    WHAT WAS THE CODE NAME?
        Mr.  Fusion.
            Thanks for answering, and sorry for yelling. Thought you were just gonna vanish and not tell us the code name :)
                No worries!
    You did the Lord’s work, son.
Kinda sucks they put him in the thumbnail tho

                i need to watch this again.

that and virtuosity.

the 90s was the best goddamn decade for movies.
                    Dude, watch Hackers again.  One of my fav movies of all time cuz it's so cringe (and Jolie was still sexy AF).

"Look at this machine!  It's got a 24.4kbps modem!!!!"
                        its 14.4kbps as a matter of fact.

ive seen hackers more times that i can count my friend.
                            Nah, it's "28.8 bps modem". Not kbps, just bps.

https://youtu.be/UEb4I5y93uA
                                shit.

i stand corrected. and i own this movie on vhs dvd and bluray.
                                These days I wouldn't bother with 28.8Mbps. :(
                        Hackers is one of my fav movies. It’s terrible but wonderful at the same time. I was active in the hacking scene back then and as much as everyone tried to hate it for being so stupid I’m pretty sure everyone actually secretly loved it. It was like bubblegum cyberpunk... a one movie genre. It also had an era defining soundtrack that actually did electronic music right. It and The Saint and Strange Days killed the 90’s soundtrack game.

It was also peak Jolie. Good god my 16 year old loins.
                            That haircut kills it for me
                        >(and Jolie was still sexy AF).

I say the same thing and people scoff at me! :D
                    Excuse me, the 80’s would like to have a word with you...
                        you can fuck right off with that argument.

the 80s pales in comparison to the 90's. although i do admit that they are the closest thing to a second place that is presently around.
                            I don’t know man, Blade Runner, Dune, Terminator, Outland, Aliens, The Abyss, They Live, Amira, Patlabor, Predator, Robocop, Repo Man, Real Genius, The Last Starfighter, Ghostbusters, Brainstorm, Tron, Empire and Jedi, Escape From NY, and Spaceballs just mention a few... I’m sticking with the 80’s.
                                The Running Man, as well.
                                The 80’s absolutely fucking dominate the 90’s in terms of movies and music. The 90’s were a cultural deadzone/transition period between analog and digital. The 80’s were the analog era perfected.
                                I agree. The 80s was amazing. The whole decade was a fucked up and weird time... For everything.
                            Lol what planet are you on. 90s is good but 80s will always be the king
                            I would say they are almost equal.  Back To The Future is probably my favorite film of all time...but I'm a 90's boy and I will never forget being around when Jurassic Park was in cinemas, I was 7, so the 90's win as far as I'm concerned!.
                                [what was that about the 80's again?](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?release_date=1990,1999&title_type=feature)

you cant fuck with that list of movies.
                Star Trek got around that by using a fictional measurement. They measured data in quads rather than bytes.
                Moores law doesnt say anything about storage, AND the whole point of data couriers was that networking wasn't secure.
                They probably just wanted it to make sense to the audience.
                It was done for the audience. People knew what a gigabyte was. They used a language the audience understands.
        replace the g with a t, and it could still be impressive. i mean, we do i have 1 tb microsd cards now, but shoving 320 of those up your nose is still going to be hard.
            The rectum is more elastic than a nose, just saying.
                "I'm gonna need you to store this data way up your butt, Johnny. WAAAAAAY up your butt!"
                    ...buurp
                Welp, found my next username. Rectal Elasticity
                    >Welp, found my next username. Rectal Elasticity

And a new hobby it sounds like...
        It’s OK he’s got that ram double software!
        When i was a kid my friend told me that he read about some rich dude who bought some custom made hdd with 10gb, i didnt believe him, my PC was 386 with 40mb or 60mb hdd :-)
    The character Keanu plays in cyberpunk is fittingly called Jonny Silverhand (which is an actual character from the lore).
    Don't worry, John Wick says "We're all Breathtaking".

            That honestly made me giggle a little. He was obviously addressing me as well.
    Id totally eat his ass
        I'd let him put a bullet in me
omg have you seen him in Always Be My Maybe? He plays a hilarious egotistical caricature of himself.
    > $6400 on dinner

> Calls them an Uber Pool

It was definitely on purpose.
    His best role since Bill and Ted.  He needs to do more comedies.
    Watched it last weekend I had no idea he was in that movie and I loved him!
A look of someone very familiar with Chinese dignitaries.
My comment exactly.
You gave him a fucking pencil!!

We’re all dead.
> With a f**king pencil.

 I mean it would be pretty badass for him to do his taxes himself considering how complicated it is for pretty much anyone of his income level. Not to mention by hand

    It’s not what you did, but who you did it to
    > robo-burn down the robo-city

C'mon, get cyberpunky
From all the _John Wick_ comments, I get the impression that there aren't all that many of us that have read [William Gibson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson) books, played [Cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020) when it first came out, or remember [Johnny Mnemonic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113481/). 

All he really wanted was [room service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1okpAj7Fhw&feature=youtu.be&t=62).
    And a $10,000 a night hooker.
    God I love this movie. 

If you *are* the type that’s read a bunch of Gibson and played the old R. Talsorian pen and paper then it makes perfect sense out of the gate. 

If you haven’t, it’s just a confusing jumble of “what the fuck? Wait, what? Why? He’s doubling himself, the shit does that mean? The yakuza is the most powerful crime syndicate in Newark?”
    I don't know why, it just feels so sad reading how Johnny dies in Neuromancer.
        Might just be me, but I feel that Johnny was our way in to the world. We were always with him, but then the his story ended. Time passes and we found ourselves with a different character, progressing through the same world...and we heard that our previously close friend had died alone.

(it's been ages since I read the Sprawl trilogy)
    Well, he is A Johnny: https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Johnny_Silverhand
        He goes by that name quite a lot...

Johnny Utah - Point Break  
Jonathan Harker - Bram Stroker's Dracula  
Johnny Mnemonic  
John Constantine
John - Generation Um...  
John Wick  
Johnny Silverhand  
He's even working on a new TV series called Rain where  he plays...John Rain.
            John is the most common name in the english language. Calling your character that name or some variation of it is a shorthand for an everyman or someone mild mannered.
    Should we read this and play the game before playing the new one?
    >	played Cyberpunk when it first came out

I loved the Cyberpunk setting but R-Tal’s mechanics were almost as frustrating as Palladium.
    I still say, "He's that guy....that fucked your mother" whenever anyone asks who someone is.
His character ingame is called "Jonny Silverhand" as well. Kind of fitting and it's not just running of Johnny Mnemonic and John Wick name, Jonny Silverhand is an actual character in the cyberpunk lore.
    A fyookin' pincil!
How do you pronounce Mnemonic? Trying to say that out loud sends my tongue through a labyrinth of impossible paths and twirls.
    Neh (like eh. Or meh)

Mon (like poke-mon)

Ic (like ick or sick)
    Just pretend the first m doesn't exist. It's silent, like the P in pterodactyl.
Underrated comment.
He's Johnny Silverhand. So assuming you are against the corps and the corrupt system, basically THE good guy.
    Until they do a twist and you give the keys to completely shutting down the system but also possibly killing loads of people to Keanu. Then you gotta stop him even though you really don't want to.
        So basically Cyberpunk's version of Frank Fontaine?
        hopefully not
    Wait, cue me in. Is he an existing character? What do we know about him so far?
        He was one of the original characters mentioned in the OG 2020 rulebook. In the gameplay trailer, the music V wakes up to is "Chippin in" by Johnny Silverhand. Check the wiki if you want to know about him.
Open world rpg so you can probably be a bad guy to. Bad guy buddies with Jonny SilverReeves? Yes please...
He's a hologram, the character if still alive would be in his 60s but he's probably dead. You can see him flicker but the world around doesn't flicker
    Well in 2020 Johnny's ex Alt developed a program to copy persona and store them in the net, theoretically this could have been used on Johnny himself as Alt has been a similar ghost since she was murdered by her own software.

And in the first trailer they remark that he had recently died.
        Unless he isn't actually as dead as reported due to sneaky bullshit instead of cheating an execution.
    That is possible. It is also possible this is an alternate Cyberpunk world where he would be his younger self. Or he could even not be there in reality and is an AR overlay from a Netrunner for various reasons.
    To be accurate, Reeves is almost in his 60s too...
Kill the guy you send to kill the Boogeyman?

Impossible.

Really genuine studio, don't have may of those around.
    Aside from the terrible treatment of workers and whatnot.
        You're supposed to explain why you gave a contrasted opinion when most people believe that they are genuine salt of the earth people.
            I'm busy so I don't really have a ton of time to go into it. Former employees from the witcher 3 development have stated however that the conditions were very tiresome and a lot was expected in short amounts of time and moral was very low. They have released a statement that for cyberpunk they are aiming to make the conditions more "humane" so they do deserve credit for improving. But its unfair to say they're completely genuine.
                Dude, that’s software development as a whole...
                    [deleted]
                        Fair enough. Good on them for recognizing the poor conditions and trying to address it. I hadn’t heard that before so I appreciate you pointing it out
                            Crunch is an issue in pretty much the entire gaming industry
                            No worries
                    not true. All my coding jobs have been cushy, I didn’t even need to finish school. The difference between my working environment and nearly any other job that isn’t union-controlled is demand for my labor. Most jobs have surplus potential workers and American industry shaves ever more profit out of them, pushing at every regulation as much as they can. Somebody can always replace them.

Gaming is like this because there is exceptional extra supply for that labor. Because it’s gaming. 

What other parts of the software development world treat their employees terribly the way they do in gaming? Everyone I know in software (besides the gaming industry people I know) would bounce pretty quickly if they were forced into crunch like that. Unless they had really good stock options and could quit after a soon to come payday.
                        There isn't long term crunch like the gaming industry but there is definitely still plenty in tech, especially when you factor in startups. Another example: SpaceX
                    Completely wrong to generalize but ok. Just cause every game studio does it doesn't mean they can. If they want to be a genuine studio maybe stop treating like trash the people that make it possible, the devs and designers
                    Please don't. It is a genuine problem and just writing it off as a major issue with ALL development is bullshit. Witcher 3 is one of my favorite games ever, but they make good use of cheap Polish labor. Also software development in general is not bad, it is game development where shit is pretty terrible.
                    Game development is notoriously the hardest conditions in terms of software dev.
                    That's definitely not true. Maybe for game software development, but in regular software, it varies company by company and team by team.
                    Being part of an industry-wide problem might not be unexpected, but hand-waving it away like that is how this stuff gets normalised in the first place.
                        I think the point is more that it's hard to shit on them when it IS normalised already.

At least they're trying to do something about it.
                    That doesn’t make it right. The fuck?
        Typical fanboys downvote you to 0 when even CD admitted to poor treatment of their workers. They are working to improve but calling them a "genuine" studio when they have this in their recent past is disingenuous.
        In what ways?
            Massive amount of crunch. Of course, it's a standard these days but that doesn't mean it's good.
                CD Project Red my friend, me downvote you because me like CD Project Red
I didn’t think they could make a game better than the Witcher 3, but then they added Keanu Reeves
For real. And it’s one of the best large studios out there. This game is going to set fucking records
    But what about sales records?
To be fair they arent the first. Payday 2 also has John Wick in their game. The problem is that its not Keanu Reeves proper.

He was not prepared for the fans in that audience and that makes it 100% better.
>I'm like "holy fuck, is that Johnny Silverhand? 

Wait, how do people already know of Silverhand if the game isn't out? Is there some other story giving background lore or something?
    Cyberpunk 2077 is based on the tabletop rpg Cyberpunk 2020 so alot of the lore like Johnny silver hand comes directly from the tabletop.
        Thank you. I thought it was just a name the internet gave him.
        I'm genuinely surprised at how many people have no idea this is based off of a Pen & Paper RPG.  But that goes to show how popular CD Projekt Red is.
I believe the term you are looking for is "fangasm".
I have only said "Is that Keanu Reeves?!" twice in my life.

First, when I watched *Always Be my Maybe* on Tuesday.

And then again today.
This was my reaction too :D :D
Remember: only do this if you have a PC to play it on
Plus, at least the witches in the past, was cheaper on gog.com

I totally agree - I'll sink with you brother!
Nope. PS4 and PC too.
    Nice ! 

Thanks man
Good /u/Wangfap
I’m so glad this didn’t leak, our whole group viewing collectively screamed when we saw him
    Surprise Keanu got everyone hyped as fuck.
    I stopped paying attention after the first title shot.  Caught me sleeping until The One told me to wake tf up cuz it aint over yet.
Thank god the french don't know people
    Thanks for the laugh friend
Seriously?  What the hell is wrong with people?  Why run the surprise?
Given that Keanu starred in a reasonably popular Cyberpunk-esque film; The Matrix, I don't think it's particularly outlandish?
    Also a reasonably unpopular one called Johnny Mnemonic.
        One of the reasons he did the Matrix was because of his Johhny Pneumonic character, which was essentially just a continuation of the character with a different name and backstory. They share so many things, and personally I think that movie is underrated, it was a good film with great staging and set design.

                    For some reason hacking in the 80's was just watching a bunch of stupid bad cgi puzzles and locked doors. because they obviously were going to be visually represented as doors and not characters on a screen.

edit: Can't forget the nuclear silo noises either.
            Welcome to Beijing, Johnny
        heh - i kind of enjoyed that movie actually.   It's hilarious that back then 80GB was just "soooo much data"  now we keep double that in our pockets for fun. 

I mean, I have around 50TB sitting on my desk right now, lol
        That was also created by the father of cyberpunk William Gibson
        Isn't it considered a cult classic now? If it isn't, then it should. Just look at it. We have Keanu, Ice-T, Takeshi Kitano, Dolph Lundgren and Henry Rollins in a 90:s cyberpunk action film written by William Gibson. It's perfect.

that was like a mind boggling large amount of data for the 90s

            i need to watch this again.

that and virtuosity.

the 90s was the best goddamn decade for movies.
                Dude, watch Hackers again.  One of my fav movies of all time cuz it's so cringe (and Jolie was still sexy AF).

"Look at this machine!  It's got a 24.4kbps modem!!!!"
                    its 14.4kbps as a matter of fact.

ive seen hackers more times that i can count my friend.
                        Nah, it's "28.8 bps modem". Not kbps, just bps.

https://youtu.be/UEb4I5y93uA
                            shit.

i stand corrected. and i own this movie on vhs dvd and bluray.
                            These days I wouldn't bother with 28.8Mbps. :(
                    Hackers is one of my fav movies. It’s terrible but wonderful at the same time. I was active in the hacking scene back then and as much as everyone tried to hate it for being so stupid I’m pretty sure everyone actually secretly loved it. It was like bubblegum cyberpunk... a one movie genre. It also had an era defining soundtrack that actually did electronic music right. It and The Saint and Strange Days killed the 90’s soundtrack game.

It was also peak Jolie. Good god my 16 year old loins.
                        That haircut kills it for me
                    >(and Jolie was still sexy AF).

I say the same thing and people scoff at me! :D
                Excuse me, the 80’s would like to have a word with you...
                    you can fuck right off with that argument.

the 80s pales in comparison to the 90's. although i do admit that they are the closest thing to a second place that is presently around.
                        I don’t know man, Blade Runner, Dune, Terminator, Outland, Aliens, The Abyss, They Live, Amira, Patlabor, Predator, Robocop, Repo Man, Real Genius, The Last Starfighter, Ghostbusters, Brainstorm, Tron, Empire and Jedi, Escape From NY, and Spaceballs just mention a few... I’m sticking with the 80’s.
                            The Running Man, as well.
                            The 80’s absolutely fucking dominate the 90’s in terms of movies and music. The 90’s were a cultural deadzone/transition period between analog and digital. The 80’s were the analog era perfected.
                            I agree. The 80s was amazing. The whole decade was a fucked up and weird time... For everything.
                        Lol what planet are you on. 90s is good but 80s will always be the king
                        I would say they are almost equal.  Back To The Future is probably my favorite film of all time...but I'm a 90's boy and I will never forget being around when Jurassic Park was in cinemas, I was 7, so the 90's win as far as I'm concerned!.
                            [what was that about the 80's again?](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?release_date=1990,1999&title_type=feature)

you cant fuck with that list of movies.
            Star Trek got around that by using a fictional measurement. They measured data in quads rather than bytes.
            Moores law doesnt say anything about storage, AND the whole point of data couriers was that networking wasn't secure.
            They probably just wanted it to make sense to the audience.
            It was done for the audience. People knew what a gigabyte was. They used a language the audience understands.
    replace the g with a t, and it could still be impressive. i mean, we do i have 1 tb microsd cards now, but shoving 320 of those up your nose is still going to be hard.
        The rectum is more elastic than a nose, just saying.
            "I'm gonna need you to store this data way up your butt, Johnny. WAAAAAAY up your butt!"
                ...buurp
            Welp, found my next username. Rectal Elasticity
                >Welp, found my next username. Rectal Elasticity

And a new hobby it sounds like...
    It’s OK he’s got that ram double software!
    When i was a kid my friend told me that he read about some rich dude who bought some custom made hdd with 10gb, i didnt believe him, my PC was 386 with 40mb or 60mb hdd :-)
The character Keanu plays in cyberpunk is fittingly called Jonny Silverhand (which is an actual character from the lore).
Don't worry, John Wick says "We're all Breathtaking".

Id totally eat his ass

> $6400 on dinner

> Calls them an Uber Pool

It was definitely on purpose.
His best role since Bill and Ted.  He needs to do more comedies.
Watched it last weekend I had no idea he was in that movie and I loved him!
My bad.
It’s not what you did, but who you did it to
> robo-burn down the robo-city

C'mon, get cyberpunky
And a $10,000 a night hooker.
God I love this movie. 

If you *are* the type that’s read a bunch of Gibson and played the old R. Talsorian pen and paper then it makes perfect sense out of the gate. 

If you haven’t, it’s just a confusing jumble of “what the fuck? Wait, what? Why? He’s doubling himself, the shit does that mean? The yakuza is the most powerful crime syndicate in Newark?”
I don't know why, it just feels so sad reading how Johnny dies in Neuromancer.
    Might just be me, but I feel that Johnny was our way in to the world. We were always with him, but then the his story ended. Time passes and we found ourselves with a different character, progressing through the same world...and we heard that our previously close friend had died alone.

(it's been ages since I read the Sprawl trilogy)
Well, he is A Johnny: https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Johnny_Silverhand
    He goes by that name quite a lot...

Johnny Utah - Point Break  
Jonathan Harker - Bram Stroker's Dracula  
Johnny Mnemonic  
John Constantine
John - Generation Um...  
John Wick  
Johnny Silverhand  
He's even working on a new TV series called Rain where  he plays...John Rain.
        John is the most common name in the english language. Calling your character that name or some variation of it is a shorthand for an everyman or someone mild mannered.
Should we read this and play the game before playing the new one?
>	played Cyberpunk when it first came out

I loved the Cyberpunk setting but R-Tal’s mechanics were almost as frustrating as Palladium.
I still say, "He's that guy....that fucked your mother" whenever anyone asks who someone is.
A fyookin' pincil!
Neh (like eh. Or meh)

Mon (like poke-mon)

Ic (like ick or sick)
Just pretend the first m doesn't exist. It's silent, like the P in pterodactyl.
Until they do a twist and you give the keys to completely shutting down the system but also possibly killing loads of people to Keanu. Then you gotta stop him even though you really don't want to.
    So basically Cyberpunk's version of Frank Fontaine?
    hopefully not
Wait, cue me in. Is he an existing character? What do we know about him so far?
    He was one of the original characters mentioned in the OG 2020 rulebook. In the gameplay trailer, the music V wakes up to is "Chippin in" by Johnny Silverhand. Check the wiki if you want to know about him.
Well in 2020 Johnny's ex Alt developed a program to copy persona and store them in the net, theoretically this could have been used on Johnny himself as Alt has been a similar ghost since she was murdered by her own software.

And in the first trailer they remark that he had recently died.
    Unless he isn't actually as dead as reported due to sneaky bullshit instead of cheating an execution.
That is possible. It is also possible this is an alternate Cyberpunk world where he would be his younger self. Or he could even not be there in reality and is an AR overlay from a Netrunner for various reasons.
To be accurate, Reeves is almost in his 60s too...

            Dude, watch Hackers again.  One of my fav movies of all time cuz it's so cringe (and Jolie was still sexy AF).

"Look at this machine!  It's got a 24.4kbps modem!!!!"
                its 14.4kbps as a matter of fact.

ive seen hackers more times that i can count my friend.
                    Nah, it's "28.8 bps modem". Not kbps, just bps.

https://youtu.be/UEb4I5y93uA
                        shit.

i stand corrected. and i own this movie on vhs dvd and bluray.
                        These days I wouldn't bother with 28.8Mbps. :(
                Hackers is one of my fav movies. It’s terrible but wonderful at the same time. I was active in the hacking scene back then and as much as everyone tried to hate it for being so stupid I’m pretty sure everyone actually secretly loved it. It was like bubblegum cyberpunk... a one movie genre. It also had an era defining soundtrack that actually did electronic music right. It and The Saint and Strange Days killed the 90’s soundtrack game.

It was also peak Jolie. Good god my 16 year old loins.
                    That haircut kills it for me
                >(and Jolie was still sexy AF).

I say the same thing and people scoff at me! :D
            Excuse me, the 80’s would like to have a word with you...
                you can fuck right off with that argument.

the 80s pales in comparison to the 90's. although i do admit that they are the closest thing to a second place that is presently around.
                    I don’t know man, Blade Runner, Dune, Terminator, Outland, Aliens, The Abyss, They Live, Amira, Patlabor, Predator, Robocop, Repo Man, Real Genius, The Last Starfighter, Ghostbusters, Brainstorm, Tron, Empire and Jedi, Escape From NY, and Spaceballs just mention a few... I’m sticking with the 80’s.
                        The Running Man, as well.
                        The 80’s absolutely fucking dominate the 90’s in terms of movies and music. The 90’s were a cultural deadzone/transition period between analog and digital. The 80’s were the analog era perfected.
                        I agree. The 80s was amazing. The whole decade was a fucked up and weird time... For everything.
                    Lol what planet are you on. 90s is good but 80s will always be the king
                    I would say they are almost equal.  Back To The Future is probably my favorite film of all time...but I'm a 90's boy and I will never forget being around when Jurassic Park was in cinemas, I was 7, so the 90's win as far as I'm concerned!.
                        [what was that about the 80's again?](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?release_date=1990,1999&title_type=feature)

you cant fuck with that list of movies.
        Star Trek got around that by using a fictional measurement. They measured data in quads rather than bytes.
        Moores law doesnt say anything about storage, AND the whole point of data couriers was that networking wasn't secure.
        They probably just wanted it to make sense to the audience.
        It was done for the audience. People knew what a gigabyte was. They used a language the audience understands.
replace the g with a t, and it could still be impressive. i mean, we do i have 1 tb microsd cards now, but shoving 320 of those up your nose is still going to be hard.

When i was a kid my friend told me that he read about some rich dude who bought some custom made hdd with 10gb, i didnt believe him, my PC was 386 with 40mb or 60mb hdd :-)
You're all breathtaking.
    You're all taking breath.
        You'te taking breath all.
    That honestly made me giggle a little. He was obviously addressing me as well.
I'd let him put a bullet in me
Might just be me, but I feel that Johnny was our way in to the world. We were always with him, but then the his story ended. Time passes and we found ourselves with a different character, progressing through the same world...and we heard that our previously close friend had died alone.

(it's been ages since I read the Sprawl trilogy)
He goes by that name quite a lot...

Johnny Utah - Point Break  
Jonathan Harker - Bram Stroker's Dracula  
Johnny Mnemonic  
John Constantine
John - Generation Um...  
John Wick  
Johnny Silverhand  
He's even working on a new TV series called Rain where  he plays...John Rain.
    John is the most common name in the english language. Calling your character that name or some variation of it is a shorthand for an everyman or someone mild mannered.
So basically Cyberpunk's version of Frank Fontaine?
hopefully not
He was one of the original characters mentioned in the OG 2020 rulebook. In the gameplay trailer, the music V wakes up to is "Chippin in" by Johnny Silverhand. Check the wiki if you want to know about him.
Unless he isn't actually as dead as reported due to sneaky bullshit instead of cheating an execution.
Commit a felony boppin the belony
    Do people not know how to spell felogna?
This is oddly specific. And doable.

You're supposed to explain why you gave a contrasted opinion when most people believe that they are genuine salt of the earth people.
    I'm busy so I don't really have a ton of time to go into it. Former employees from the witcher 3 development have stated however that the conditions were very tiresome and a lot was expected in short amounts of time and moral was very low. They have released a statement that for cyberpunk they are aiming to make the conditions more "humane" so they do deserve credit for improving. But its unfair to say they're completely genuine.
        Dude, that’s software development as a whole...
            [deleted]
                Fair enough. Good on them for recognizing the poor conditions and trying to address it. I hadn’t heard that before so I appreciate you pointing it out
                    Crunch is an issue in pretty much the entire gaming industry
                    No worries
            not true. All my coding jobs have been cushy, I didn’t even need to finish school. The difference between my working environment and nearly any other job that isn’t union-controlled is demand for my labor. Most jobs have surplus potential workers and American industry shaves ever more profit out of them, pushing at every regulation as much as they can. Somebody can always replace them.

Gaming is like this because there is exceptional extra supply for that labor. Because it’s gaming. 

What other parts of the software development world treat their employees terribly the way they do in gaming? Everyone I know in software (besides the gaming industry people I know) would bounce pretty quickly if they were forced into crunch like that. Unless they had really good stock options and could quit after a soon to come payday.
                There isn't long term crunch like the gaming industry but there is definitely still plenty in tech, especially when you factor in startups. Another example: SpaceX
            Completely wrong to generalize but ok. Just cause every game studio does it doesn't mean they can. If they want to be a genuine studio maybe stop treating like trash the people that make it possible, the devs and designers
            Please don't. It is a genuine problem and just writing it off as a major issue with ALL development is bullshit. Witcher 3 is one of my favorite games ever, but they make good use of cheap Polish labor. Also software development in general is not bad, it is game development where shit is pretty terrible.
            Game development is notoriously the hardest conditions in terms of software dev.
            That's definitely not true. Maybe for game software development, but in regular software, it varies company by company and team by team.
            Being part of an industry-wide problem might not be unexpected, but hand-waving it away like that is how this stuff gets normalised in the first place.
                I think the point is more that it's hard to shit on them when it IS normalised already.

At least they're trying to do something about it.
            That doesn’t make it right. The fuck?
Typical fanboys downvote you to 0 when even CD admitted to poor treatment of their workers. They are working to improve but calling them a "genuine" studio when they have this in their recent past is disingenuous.
In what ways?
    Massive amount of crunch. Of course, it's a standard these days but that doesn't mean it's good.
        CD Project Red my friend, me downvote you because me like CD Project Red
no u
    no. U.
        You're ALL breathtaking!
Thank you. I thought it was just a name the internet gave him.
I'm genuinely surprised at how many people have no idea this is based off of a Pen & Paper RPG.  But that goes to show how popular CD Projekt Red is.
One of the reasons he did the Matrix was because of his Johhny Pneumonic character, which was essentially just a continuation of the character with a different name and backstory. They share so many things, and personally I think that movie is underrated, it was a good film with great staging and set design.

        Honestly, that's not that far off from modern day VR, at least from the control scheme.
            For some reason hacking in the 80's was just watching a bunch of stupid bad cgi puzzles and locked doors. because they obviously were going to be visually represented as doors and not characters on a screen.

edit: Can't forget the nuclear silo noises either.
    Welcome to Beijing, Johnny
heh - i kind of enjoyed that movie actually.   It's hilarious that back then 80GB was just "soooo much data"  now we keep double that in our pockets for fun. 

I mean, I have around 50TB sitting on my desk right now, lol
That was also created by the father of cyberpunk William Gibson
Isn't it considered a cult classic now? If it isn't, then it should. Just look at it. We have Keanu, Ice-T, Takeshi Kitano, Dolph Lundgren and Henry Rollins in a 90:s cyberpunk action film written by William Gibson. It's perfect.
Thanks for answering, and sorry for yelling. Thought you were just gonna vanish and not tell us the code name :)
    No worries!

        I think the point is more that it's hard to shit on them when it IS normalised already.

At least they're trying to do something about it.
    That doesn’t make it right. The fuck?
CD Project Red my friend, me downvote you because me like CD Project Red
You're ALL breathtaking!
This one's comin' at chu... low tech style.
    Loop that shit (dolphin begins splashing around)
I vaguely remember seeing this when I was younger. I don’t remember it being as bad as everyone says it is, guess its rewind time.
well it was written by the founder of cyberpunk soooooooooooo..........
Honestly, that's not that far off from modern day VR, at least from the control scheme.
    For some reason hacking in the 80's was just watching a bunch of stupid bad cgi puzzles and locked doors. because they obviously were going to be visually represented as doors and not characters on a screen.

edit: Can't forget the nuclear silo noises either.
Dude, watch Hackers again.  One of my fav movies of all time cuz it's so cringe (and Jolie was still sexy AF).

"Look at this machine!  It's got a 24.4kbps modem!!!!"
    its 14.4kbps as a matter of fact.

ive seen hackers more times that i can count my friend.
        Nah, it's "28.8 bps modem". Not kbps, just bps.

            shit.

i stand corrected. and i own this movie on vhs dvd and bluray.
            These days I wouldn't bother with 28.8Mbps. :(
    Hackers is one of my fav movies. It’s terrible but wonderful at the same time. I was active in the hacking scene back then and as much as everyone tried to hate it for being so stupid I’m pretty sure everyone actually secretly loved it. It was like bubblegum cyberpunk... a one movie genre. It also had an era defining soundtrack that actually did electronic music right. It and The Saint and Strange Days killed the 90’s soundtrack game.

It was also peak Jolie. Good god my 16 year old loins.
        That haircut kills it for me
    >(and Jolie was still sexy AF).

I say the same thing and people scoff at me! :D
Excuse me, the 80’s would like to have a word with you...
    you can fuck right off with that argument.

the 80s pales in comparison to the 90's. although i do admit that they are the closest thing to a second place that is presently around.
        I don’t know man, Blade Runner, Dune, Terminator, Outland, Aliens, The Abyss, They Live, Amira, Patlabor, Predator, Robocop, Repo Man, Real Genius, The Last Starfighter, Ghostbusters, Brainstorm, Tron, Empire and Jedi, Escape From NY, and Spaceballs just mention a few... I’m sticking with the 80’s.
            The Running Man, as well.
            The 80’s absolutely fucking dominate the 90’s in terms of movies and music. The 90’s were a cultural deadzone/transition period between analog and digital. The 80’s were the analog era perfected.
            I agree. The 80s was amazing. The whole decade was a fucked up and weird time... For everything.
        Lol what planet are you on. 90s is good but 80s will always be the king
        I would say they are almost equal.  Back To The Future is probably my favorite film of all time...but I'm a 90's boy and I will never forget being around when Jurassic Park was in cinemas, I was 7, so the 90's win as far as I'm concerned!.

    Fair enough. Good on them for recognizing the poor conditions and trying to address it. I hadn’t heard that before so I appreciate you pointing it out
        Crunch is an issue in pretty much the entire gaming industry
        No worries
not true. All my coding jobs have been cushy, I didn’t even need to finish school. The difference between my working environment and nearly any other job that isn’t union-controlled is demand for my labor. Most jobs have surplus potential workers and American industry shaves ever more profit out of them, pushing at every regulation as much as they can. Somebody can always replace them.

Gaming is like this because there is exceptional extra supply for that labor. Because it’s gaming. 

What other parts of the software development world treat their employees terribly the way they do in gaming? Everyone I know in software (besides the gaming industry people I know) would bounce pretty quickly if they were forced into crunch like that. Unless they had really good stock options and could quit after a soon to come payday.
    There isn't long term crunch like the gaming industry but there is definitely still plenty in tech, especially when you factor in startups. Another example: SpaceX
Completely wrong to generalize but ok. Just cause every game studio does it doesn't mean they can. If they want to be a genuine studio maybe stop treating like trash the people that make it possible, the devs and designers
Please don't. It is a genuine problem and just writing it off as a major issue with ALL development is bullshit. Witcher 3 is one of my favorite games ever, but they make good use of cheap Polish labor. Also software development in general is not bad, it is game development where shit is pretty terrible.
Game development is notoriously the hardest conditions in terms of software dev.
That's definitely not true. Maybe for game software development, but in regular software, it varies company by company and team by team.
