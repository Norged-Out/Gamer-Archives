Hey all,

It flew by fast, but the AMA is now over.

Thank you to everyone for coming to the AMA! There was a lot of interesting questions and answers.

And from the community, thank you everyone at CDPR and Trigger! This has been an amazing opportunity!
As you and Wakabayashi-san were the music selectors for the show, how did the process of selecting "I Really Want To Stay At Your House" as David and Lucy's main love theme come about?
    (Imaishi) As we were looking for a song to play at the end of EP2, "I Really Want to Stay at Your House" just stuck with me. Even within the radio music line-up for Cyberpunk 2077, this song evoked emotions that I thought would fit the show.
        Perfect choice honestly, I can't imagine the ending using any other song from the radio OST
            Did they use only song from the radio or other songs in the show ? Because they didn't have to use the ones from the radio no ? 

I just love the song.
                They used quite a few songs from the radio soundtrack in the anime. If you're asking something else, then I'm not sure what
        GREAT choice. Devastating.
            San-devastating‚Ä¶
        Flawless song choice, play the song in a happy scene just to crush us with it at the end
        The right choice was made. I binge watched the show in one day high af and couldn't remember how this song sounded. I listened. Now I'm on episode 4. Thank you all for making this show.üòÅ
        I love how the song gives a sense of ‚Äúlife is just a party, don‚Äôt take it so serious,‚Äù which is incredibly sad and cheerful at the same time
    Are there only Cyberpunk 2077 music or some are original songs in the anime ?
        AMA‚Äôs already over, but yes there are original tracks like from Franz Ferdinand, dawid podsiad≈Ço, and Akira Yamaoka‚Äôs original score
Would you like to work with CD Project Red in the future to produce more anime?
    (Imaishi) If they approach us with something cool, maybe!
        Thanks for your response
            oh my a possible witcher anime üò≥
                CDPR cant, they dont have rights so its only Netflix that could and we know they hate the source material...
                    Nightmare of the wolf was really good
                Based on how trigger handled cyberpunk it‚Äôll be a lot better than the current show that‚Äôs for sure
        I sincerely hope not see more cub round content from you all, Edgerunners really added to the game/world in incredible ways.
How much of an influence was other series like Akira, Ghost in the shell, Serial Experiments Lain and Neon Genesis Evangelion to creating the dynamics and world building of Edgerunners?
    (Imaishi) I think all cyberpunk works of the past have influenced me in some way. Evangelion has influenced me on a personal level, regardless of Edgerunners.
        Faraday‚Äôs three eyes reminded me of the SEELE logo from Evangelion
            SO I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE THAT SAW THAT
        I saw so much of Evangelion in this show. In particular, the shift from action show to psychological horror.
    Let's all love lain!
( hop over to r/lain for more quality lain content lol)
Why do you hurt us?
    (Imaishi) Sorry...<3
        >Sorry...<3

Press x to doubt
            Pain.

üéµ *I Really Want To Stay At Your House*üéµ
        </3
    just got straight to the pointüòÇüòÇüòÇ brief but make sense lol
    Lmaooo dude's asking the real questionüòÇ
Are there any small details, scenes or extra plot that had to be left out that you would include in your *Director's cut*?
    (Imaishi) I would like to include more scenes with Rebecca's guns.
        OMG PLS MORE REBECCA ü•∫
        Everyone wanted more scenes with Rebecca and her guns
        Yes a whole history of Rebecca would be outstanding. Or a Rebecca side story, a ‚Äúwhat if‚Ä¶‚Äù scenario would be excellent.

You guys made amazing characters.
        Based
What did Adam Smasher mean when he asked David, "You know, you could prove an interesting construct." ?
    (Imaishi) He meant exactly what he said, but a 'construct' is a concept taken from the game, so please refer there for more info.
        OH SHIIIII
            BROSKI WE HAVE SO MUCH COPIUM MATERIAL
            Of which David politely refused his offer. And then Smasher put a high caliber round in his head.

He‚Äôs gone, choomba.
                ~~That's literally the exact scenario Johnny goes through in the game~~ :p I don't think he's coming back in any sort of living sense but the path is certainly available.

Edit: Nevermind, you don't conclusively see that he is shot in the head. It's weird with the first person view
                    Wasn‚Äôt Johnny shot in the arm? He was certainly alive enough to be brought before Saburo to be placed into Mikoshi
                        Johnny‚Äôs memories are not to be trusted. I doubt the conversation with Saburo happened like that, and was probably had after Johnny was already turned into a construct, as he is likely to have bled out and died on the floor of Arasaka tower. We know via Jackie that people don‚Äôt need to be alive to be made a construct, so Johnny could have been dead for a little while before being turned into a construct. 

In the tabletop, he is absolutely obliterated at the tower, his body is shot in half, and Spider Murphy uses a ‚Äúdata slug‚Äù and I‚Äôm not even entirely sure what that‚Äôs supposed to do.
                            "Data slug" is just slang for "chip," I think; Spider Murphy is implied to have a functioning copy of Soulkiller on this one. It's labeled an old gift from Alt, who had developed the program before she was ever kidnapped, and Spider says "sorry" to Johnny when she installs it.

So what seems to happen when Johnny dies is, Spider tries to copy his engram to save his consciousness, but she has to leave his body with the copied engram still installed. There's another story at the end that tells us where his body winds up, but presumably either the engram was still with his body at that point in 2045 or Adam Smasher or somebody took the chip out of his head but left his body in the tower.

I find it hard to believe anyone would bother recovering a chip, personally, unless Smasher somehow knew Spider had a working Soulkiller. The other option is that Arasaka somehow recovered his body after 2045, or maybe Alt copied his engram into the Net during the attack on the tower and Arasaka captured him from there.
                        You're right actually, I think in the scene it looks like he may be blocking the shot to his head / body with his arm, and it definitely hits his arm.
                I mean "whatever choom" can be interpreted very liberally
                Guess we'll see, choom. Perhaps CDPR can implement the ER cast back in some way in the DLC/Orion.

Or maybe that was just the last we see of them, which is also possible.
                    Nope he is gone, your are addicted to copium the same way  people are addicted to chrome.
                        I mean, he's dead yeah. But construct is something that we don't know about.
        Oh cool as, I was right about it then
        Thank you! I was wondering.
    Well if I was to make an assumption I would say he meant kinda like an engram, like what happened to Johnny in the game. I‚Äôm not 100% sure but I think I remember them referring to him as a construct. So basically a digital version of David they could use to do stuff

Edit: according to trigger the ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù is a concept from the game and upon googling it I‚Äôm like 99% sure that I‚Äôm right and Adam meant to turn davids consciousness into a code like Johnny was
        I always thought he meant it as making David into another "smasher". He had managed to handle all that cyberwear so smasher thought he might be able to become a full cyborg like he had. David rejected that idea since it would mean giving up his humanity so smasher zeroed him
            Nah, read up on Alt Cunningham and the Soulkiller program. 

Basically, the program started as a way to preserve dying consciousness. There's even an item called an "emergency self construct" that is meant as a digital backup of a personality. 

In essence, in this scene Smasher is thinking of Silverhand and his fate, and the parallels to David's situation. 

ALSO tinfoil hat time, but I feel strongly that Smasher is a construct. He's entirely machine at this point, the only part that's him is his "soul". But it takes a special mind to be able to take total or even heavy conversion, and to handle trauma. 
Coupled with the undercurrent of "secret AI cabal that may be possessing humans and running the government" I could see this being special foreshadowing.
                I personally think smasher is the opposite. He's a real person... Who's constantly in a psychotic state. He's a man who has no humanity left, he will kill anyone without hesitation. He is a cyberpsycho, just one that doesn't show the outward symptoms.
                    I agree somewhat tbh, that's what's "special" about his mind. 

Even before conversion, he was a sadistic man with a penchant for cruelty and violence. His slip into madness was more of a sidestep.

However he is definitely no longer human.  He apparently has a second, more human body he can use for normal stuff. Which means he's definitely a construct, or something very near. And his whole thing is "metal is better than meat".
            Idk maybe. I think smasher would have zeroed him anyway though, doesn‚Äôt strike me as the kind of guy to make his own decisions tbh. More like a follow order type
                I agree for 99% of things, but I'd argue this (a particularly difficult opponent that gives him a run for his money) might be the one thing he actually does have interest in making a decision about.
                    The tech that David was using had been meant for him too, so his ability to resist and use it definitely impressed him.
                        Following triggers official reply Adam was referring to the concept in the game, which turns out is exactly what I thought. It‚Äôs basically a backup of your consciousness, like Johnny.
                Maybe, but he's still a high rank in the arisaka corp so his word would definitely carry merit. If he thinks David could play a similar role to him, the top brass would definitely take note, especially if David had been willing and desperate to do so and how successful smasher had been up until then.
                    Following triggers official reply Adam was referring to the concept in the game, which turns out is exactly what I thought. It‚Äôs basically a backup of your consciousness, like Johnny.
What were your thoughts going into this project? Since it was an already well established setting, is there anything you had to change from what you initially wanted to do?
    (Imaishi) Speaking of things that we wanted to do, but didn't... we couldn't draw David's dick in the show.
        A tragic oversight..
            Society is not ready
        this is the AMA content we come for.
            in more ways than one
        does David have a Cyber Dick?
            he did not seem to have one in the cyberskeleton, yet Smasher's dialog with Evelyn suggests he does. Another way he is more advanced than David was.
                Smasher actually has a separate body for more "human" things. He has engaged in hedonism with that

His general body is effectively a military mecha. He has a brain/CNS container transferred between the two.
                    His second body also looks similar to Elvis if I am not mistaken.
                        You're correct
                        Is this from the tabletop? All the info I can find references his OG body getting hella exploded and him just living as a full time Mecha.
                            Yeah, this is Tabletop lore.  When he and Michiko had their fling he was in a Gemini body that resembled a [young blond Elvis.](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Adam_Smasher)
        Ayoooo bahahahah
        Unfortunate.
        Lemme guess. It's built different.
What was it about the song ‚ÄúI Really Want To Stay at Your House‚Äù that made you want to use it as what was essentially the theme song for David and Lucy? Furthermore, what is your views on the large amount of ‚Äúcopium‚Äù content created by fans? I really enjoyed the show and thank you for giving everyone here this amazing opportunity to have a deeper look into the making of the show!
    (Elder) There was a similar question about "I Really Want to Stay at Your House" above, so please reference the response there. Also, we were unfamiliar with what 'copium' was & received the following definition:  To "cope" is to deal with a sad situation. "Copium" implies there's some substance to make you cope from a situation.

(Imaishi) I admire everyone's persistence on wanting a happy ending. Please continue creating as much 'copium' to your heart's content.
        Saya, that was the correct term. :) What a great response!
        Here you go, good sir

        Thank you. We will endeavor to heal our hearts by continuing to enjoy your fantastic work! :)
        You don't have to tell me twice, I'm basically a copium factory at this point
    Braindances are literal copium
I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edgerunners/comments/ytm365/an_important_discovery_spoilers/) about how the Sandevistan activation scenes accurately track motion of the character's using it and noticed something different during Adam Smasher's first use. He glides along the floor instead of moving his body, so my question is can you either confirm or deny that Adam Smasher wears an advanced form of Heelys‚Ñ¢ the American product that places a wheel in the heel of ones shoe allowing them to glide along the ground?
    (Imaishi) No, his feet don't have wheels. He just moves so fast that it looks like he's gliding.
        RIP boys, no Heelys canon.
            I feel‚Ä¶ empty
            There‚Äôs cybernetic roller blade feet in the TTRPG
                MegaMan had wheels on heels! Why can't Smasher? Imagine the car chase scenes we could've had!!
            My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
    Even if he did have heelys that wouldnt make sense cuz he went sideways right?
        they would've been omnidirectional because future
            We have omnidirectional wheels already actually. 

A series of tapered cylinders angled and set along a rim to make a circle that can roll in any direction.
                true but i ain't seen heely's with those

YET
    It was worth a shot
Was your plan from the beginning to include the dream of reaching the moon? I loved that touch and felt it really made this project special, especially with the ending.
    (Imaishi) Thank you, but no. Once we received the final draft of the scripts, we staged the episodes to move towards those scenes.
As director, what was your personal favorite episode and why?
    (Imaishi) EP8. It didn't have as much action as the other episodes, but I still liked it.
Could we get some plots between ep6 and ep7? Like how did David chrome up that much, and the relationship development with Lucy.
    (Imaishi) Ooh, to be honest, I hadn't given that any thought up to this point.
        Well, this is auspicious.  You could fit a season or two into that gap, and they'd be leaving money on the table if they didn't at least try to make more!
            They pulled the whole Cyberpunk 2077 intro with Jackie on that one.
                "7 months later..." 

I WANNA PLAY WITH JACKIE MORE!! üò¢
                    same, jackie was such a well written character they took him from us way too soon :((
                        For me that fealt like we should've gotten to play that time skip as the streetkid the intro is super short and fealt like it was missing something, a few missions with Jackie at least could've helped with that and make his death hit harder
                    Is that a confirmed DLC or not? I haven‚Äôt read anything one way or the other
        It's probably worth considering a single OVA episode ü§î
    Yeah they could make another season between those two episodes.
        Lucy spin off of her saving david from other netrunners??
Similar to other TRIGGER properties getting compilation books, can we expect an artbook or storyboard compilation book for Edgerunners to release anytime soon?
    (Imaishi) If there was, I'd like a copy.
        We need one lol
        Same
To what extent was playing Cyberpunk 2077 a part of the production process for the show?
    (Imaishi) If we hadn't considered that part important, the final production would have ended up as a seriously weird anime.
        Paramount should take notes
            netflix other shows too, they didn't even read the books lol
                But what about nepotism and writers who already wrote their own story and just want to reuse the IP and characters 

What about their feelings?
                    did you forget the /s or are you actually asking people to think of witcher series writers feelings?
                        What about their pride? They know their story/show is better

Its rude of us to see it as the shit that it is
            Fucking fr.
            Thank youuuuu
            And Netflix
            Yeah it might help them if they ever try to do something with Halo!
Who was your favorite character?
    (Imaishi) Kiwi
        based
        based
        A man of culture
        Hell yeah

Do Kiwi's nipples dispense Gatorade?
    (Imaishi) They do not dispense Gatorade. However, sometimes she has spiderweb tattoos, and on those days, they shoot out spider silk.
        WHAT-
            ITS CANON BOYS!! SHE HAS SPIDER TITS :0
        As one of the two (with OP) who works on the related fanfic, among many other fanfics and writers, I want to personally thank you. :)
            Go now, do the cyber-gods work!
            Kimouchiii! *proceeds to eject spider silk cus its one of those days*
        THE ONE PIECE IS REAL

                #SOO HIIGGHHH
        That‚Äôs canon, baby
        Bro, what??? That was NOT what I was expecting to hear from you
        Considering the Midnight Lady product line offers breast tasers, this might not be a shitpost response.
            Yo can Fem V get some of those?
        Judy would like a word
        absolutely crying over here lol
    Ayo?
Was there any content that was cut for being too violent or explicit?
    (Imaishi) Nope!
        Except for David's weiner.
            Rip David's chrome-cock
            Too violent
            Bigger, longer, uncut.
        Awesome, thanks for responding!
is David actually dead?
    (Imaishi) He's really dead.
        NO COPIUM TODAY FELLAS
            Or double down and go with engram copium theory, still dead but you can get your hopes up.
                Is him suffering in emergency purgatory truly hope?
                    Anything that happened to him at the end is fucked up, dies never achieving anything or captured by Arasaka for endless torture. That's just cyberpunk, I was referring to hopes for more of his story.
                        He did manage to get his girlfriend to the moon and became a Night City legend.
                            Arasaka buries the incident only leaving a legend that amounts to a drink at a bar that anyone can get if they die and a BD warning in some alley, and as for Lucy how long do you think it will take for Arasaka to find her because eventually they will and all her allies aren't around to help her this time.
                                Not just anyone gets a drink if they die. Only those who die in a spectacular and notable fashion. Remember Lucy's words.

"You don't make a name as a cyberpunk by how you live. You're remembered by how you die." David's final ride definitely made a name for him and that's an accomplishment in Night City. Mercs look up to these legends.
                                    Just getting the drink doesn't make you a legend, you can get Jackie a drink and I'm sure hardly anyone in Night City finds him legendary. Also Claire just says that they are named after their regulars and you need to die, the best way being to die in a spectacular fashion, mid op would be best.
        Johnny Silverhand is just a cyberghost. Maybe we could hear from David again one day.
            Johnny has soulkiller used on him which is said to be really painfull, shit and piss yourself kinda pain. I did not see that happen to David.
            Adam specifically asked if David wanted to be an Engram. And David declined, which Adam respected.

David is truly dead.
                COPIUM but Johnny, Jackie, Alt.. etc did not wish to become an engram but still became one unwillingly.
            nah smasher turned his brain into a mush
        Is REBECCA actually dead?
            You get a clear glimpse of her brains being spilled on the pavement. She's gone, homie. It's time we accepted that.
                I CAN BUILD HER BACK
                    Do you have the technology tho?
                        Enough copium can make anything happen
                            You not getting the reference made me sad
                        We have the technology
        :"c
        Nooooo
        NOOOOO!

Well, everyone kind of expected him to be dead but seeing it confirmed still hurts :'(
        I mean once you mentioned atom smasher I figured most of them would die.  People upset about this haven't read any of the Gibson novels.  I'm mostly upset that Rebecca died.  Great show.
        no no no no no no no there's still a chance he's fucking with us
        </3
        ü•≤
        God damnit !
        You didn't have to answer this question :(
    Lmao don‚Äôt make him leave
    Well, Johny silver hand is dead, but he‚Äôs still in v, let‚Äôs just hope that they love their wordplay
Hi!

1. How is everyone doing today?

2. If I recall correctly, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners involved a lot of digital animation. Despite this, the anime still retained Imaishi's signature style of animation that has been present in his previous directed works. Is it challenging to maintain that style as more of your projects become digitally animated rather than traditional?

3. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is a Japanese anime in collaboration with a Polish studio/developer for an American made universe. Was it interesting to collaborate on such a project with people across the world and is there any noteworthy experience you would like to share from it?
    1. (Imaishi) Typing away at the keyboard
2. (Imaishi) I started drawing in analog, so it's difficult for me to work with digital & 3D art styles. On the other hand, I enjoy it because it allows me to express my work in new ways.
3. (Imaishi) It was very stimulating to interact with so many people who have different backgrounds & preferences from Japanese people.
Loved the show big time, thank yall for the wonderful time!
How did you guys go about deciding the music for the show?
Also how do you personally feel about the ending? Did it accomplish what you wanted?
    (Imaishi) The OP/ED was selected by CDPR. All the other songs featured in the show were chosen by us.   


In my opinion, that ending was inevitable. I feel that I've accomplished what I wanted to do in the cyberpunk sandbox.
        we need more‚Ä¶ ü•π
        Inevitable is exactly the word that came to my mind while watching. Tragic and almost unbearable, in its inevitability
            ( SPOILER ) once I saw David shaking and Shit like Maine I was like Noooooooooooo !!!! üíîüíî
            "there are no happy endings in night city" is a theme i feel fits the cyberpunk universe better than any other
            Once smasher got into the plot there was no way back, I knew it.
First off, congratulations Director Hiroyuki & Producer Elder on an absolutely amazing show!

Are there any stories that you & the team thought about, but didn't have time to tell? There's so much packed into 10 episodes, so many little details and hints. It really felt like 20 episodes of stuff in mind.

Also.. favorite guns/weapons?
    (Imaishi) We tried to focus on telling David & Lucy's story, but some early scenarios involved more gang warfare, which I personally enjoyed.   


My favorite guns are The Carnage and the Zhuo.
        If the series was longer, I would have loved to see more gang warfare with seeing the whole crew together doing stuff, before it all started to go downhill.
            Events flown over by the time skip certainly comes to mind. Maybe a particularly deadly incident lead David to bulk up the way he did. Maybe they lost more recruits like tripwire grenade guy.
What is considered the "original" language of the show?
    (Imaishi) The characters speak English because the show is set in Night City, but in my mind, I was making an anime where everyone spoke Japanese.
        Thanks for the response and congratulations on a truly awesome series.
        Personally I liked the dubbed version better but to his his own
            same, choom. all the cyberpunk slang and such is English, plus the English accents were more accurate.
        David and his mom have an Hispanic last names and live in a mostly Hispanic populated place so... Spanish(?
            English with some Spanish words is appropriate, mijo
                Of course compa√±ero
How do you think this videogame adaptations would affect the anime industry in the future? In Netflix we had Castlevania and now Cyberpunk 2077 both successful. Do you think this is possible to be repeated in the future with another game?
    (Imaishi) The adaptation of Cyberpunk 2077 was made possible by the fact that it was an open-world game. If the base game is different, I think it would be difficult to repeat or copy what we did with Edgerunners.
        What a perfect response. Because you KNOW people will get mad if an anime series goes off the game's script coughTheElitistscough
Is there a chance that a sequel be made ?  


Also, what happens to Lucy after the show ? does she ever recover from David's passing ?
    (Imaishi) I, personally, haven't decided on anything that happened after the ending.
        There‚Äôs hope guys and gals!
    If you do the side quest to get David jacket, Falco says "we" and "us" instead of "me" or "I" meaning hes not alone, and the only other one thats alive from David gang it has to be Lucy... right?
        i don't consider this canon for a simple reason: Lucy would've never given up David's jacket, especially to some random schmuck they never even met, to me, it's just the devs way of saying "hey uh, you want his jacket ? here."
            It's canon by the studio.
                are sure ? it's kinda finnicky to be honest, i mean i wouldn't mind if it wasn't canon, it's supposed to be a dlc item, like the witcher jacket; you're not obligated to have a justification for getting the item
                    It's the Falco conversation that makes it cannon .  Also it may show that lucy is trying to move on.


Also it's David that lucy wants not his fucking jacket.
                        Heh, it still looks like a quickly thought up idea by the devs to justify you getting the jacket to me, but then again, it's still minor enough to not count as gospel in the grand scheme of things  


as for your arguments, i'd say people's relation to mementos are special, you could argue that David wanted his mother back, not her jacket, there are plenty of characters that keep a loved one's outfit or piece of outfit as a way to remember them, like Ezio with his father's robes or Jack Marston with John's hat
                            I didn't explain myself on the jacket thing well enough. Night city is all about stuff in general.  In a nutshell, Lucy didn't want his cyberware, weapons or clothing, she wanted him. Another thing she's really into making bd's like Judy, Lucy seems like the type of person to record these interactions and feelings directly on to bd file which she would have to relive memories.

Her having the jacket as you say is important but probably not necessary for her.
                                in the end, it is still up to debate, but i do believe that it's important enough for her to keep, and, at least, not give up to a random bozo she never met
            I definitely agree with you about Lucy not giving up probably the only material thing she has left from the love of her life to some random guy she never met
    No, she did not return from the moon.
        i'm sorry but, uh, that wasn't exactly the point of my question
            I'm sorry, I actually just knew that Lucy became a resident of the Moon. I went back to this comment cuz I sounded so ridiculousüòÇ
[deleted]
    (Imaishi) I entrusted the English version completely to CDPR, so it was a testament to the hard work of CDPR's localization team.
    I also feel that way with the English dub of Castlevania...
        In Castlevania English is the original language. It's made by an American studio.
            That makes sense.
    In my opinion, dubbing to Latin Spanish also feels natural even though it has some idioms.
I saw on Wiki that Lucy has a "Midnight Lady", is that true?
    (Imaishi) It's hard to stop thinking about those things once you start, so I did my best not to. I'll look into it.
    Can someone enlighten me about what a "Midnight Lady" is???
        Female sexual implant commonly used by prostitutes
            What exactly does it do? I'm sorry, I haven't played the game yet
                it helps you last longer or shorter in bed - it has a pp counterpart called mr studd
                    I see. Thanks!
                    This is different than the joytoy chip? Cuz that basically makes u go on autopilot.
                        It's the input/output side of things, , vs. the "Severed" effect of the chipped people working at Clouds.
        [heres the wiki article ](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Midnight_Lady)
            Thanks!

        Oooh that‚Äôs going to cause some arguments online
            I TRIED, PETITE WOMEN THEORISTS. WE WERE SO CLOSE TO WINNING.
                We already have somewhat of an answer from a CDPR employee that worked with them on the show that lists her as around 20. I doubt they were going to contradict that.
                I figure Japanese just doesn't have a word for shortstacks.
            ha perfect to remain unknown
                We still have the "around 20" answer from Rafal Jaki who had input on the show and is credited for his work. That's the best we'll probably get unless the Edgerunners mission kit gives us a specific age.
                ~~the loli must stay~~
                    just think about how crucial that was
        You could send so many to jail
        Uooohh üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
        And this is what caused the great divide among Edgerunners fans

        Wrong answer.
    I had to scroll so far to find this. This is literally all everyone ever talks about in context of this show, what the hell reddit
        CDPR have already said she and Lucy are around 20 years old, Maine's crew is late 30s, and David went from 17 to 18 during the time skip
Could we have an "what if" happy ending episode or short?
    (Imaishi) Probably not...

OP: Thank you for your wonderful work. The rim lights are very impressive, but are there any meanings or rules for each rim light color?  
  
(Director Imaishi) There are no rules, but I match the emotions of the scene.
            What‚Äôs rim light colors referring to, anyone might know?
                I think they are talking about theLighting in the scenes blue and dark for death, purble for love, red for violence ect
                It's a style of lighting you can see a lot in portrait photography, you have your fill light to light the scene, key light to light the subject and rim light defines edges from slightly behind the subject. Rim is like another way to say edge, say the edge of a cup is called a "rim", and it'll look like an aura when lighting a person's hair and clothes.

Come to think of it... Rim lights.. Edge lights. Fitting!

since many people want a sequel, what do you think about a movie? a movie about david's timeskip could work
    And Gloria as a crew member with Maine and others.
        She wasn't really a crew member though, she just harvested chrome from dead bodies and sold it to Maine.
            You can say there was more to the story when Maine actually respected her and more importantly trusted her. And trust of Maine wasn't something you'd get by just supplying stuff.
                It can be if you have an honest and reliable, mutually beneficial relationship over several years.
        Ayo I would love to see this
    this is a great idea. so many people want a sequel but don't understand this isn't a series where you can just make a sequel, the story is over and the damage is done, while david's legend lives on. i feel if anything, closest we could get to a sequel is another season or standalone series following a new story in night city. a movie expanding on the timeskip could be a much easier/more affordable way to give fans more content though
Most challenging scene to animate in the show?
Good afternoon, Imaishi-san!

What were some key media pieces (books, manga, other anime, etc) outside of the Cyberpunk core material that helped direct the *atmosphere* of your work in Edgerunners? 

You've created an environment that I yearn to live in despite knowing how objective dystopia-like it is, and that's amazing!
    saaame dude, i crave this almost apocalyptic setting soooo much
        See you on the moon, friend.
            hell, nah, i'm gonna die
Where did you find the inspiration for David‚Äôs character?
    Anyone else think of him as Michelangelo's David? He ends up getting pretty sculpted lol
        While generic: I always thought of David as another Icarus scenario. Flew too close to the tower and had his wings melted by Smasher
After seeing Cyberpunk: Edgerunners being a huge success, but with no direct sequel in the foreseeable future, will there be possible projects of other stories such as the origins of Adam Smasher or another original character in the Cyberpunk universe?
    Dude that‚Äôs what I want to know, Morgan Blackhand story anyone?
Did Lucy take off her helmet at the end?
    Good question but left unanswered ü•≤
        he answered it in another question. He said he doesn't know what happens to lucy or any of the other characters after the series ends
1- Could Rebecca have pulled David back from cyberpsychosis if Lucy wasn't in danger?

2- What is/was Rebecca's dream?

3- Thoughts on the Sasha/Rebecca past? Passing on her gun? Were they romantic?
The biomechanics involved in doing that "legs up" pose imply that Rebecca's upgraded arms continue all the way up to her shoulders, but we never got to see her without long sleeves after getting those upgrades, either in the show or in reference art. Exactly how far up do those cyberlimbs go? Are they swappable like Doc's?
    Given that those arms are strong enough to allow her to handle the moral equivalent of a Browning M2 heavy machinegun from the hip, they have to be solidly anchored to her torso or the recoil from her *fucking cannon* would rip her arms off.
Sasha Yakovleva was a really cool side character that we saw in the "Let You Down" AMV. Was Sasha ever originally in the plans or scripts for Edge Runners? Or was she created just specifically for the music video?
    Worth noting a different studio did that music video.
First, I watched this animei five times
Thank you for making such a great masterpiece
I hope you will solve my curiosity

Q1. QUESTION about No.31 BD CHIP

In episode 5 JK part, No.31 BD chip came out of No.32 case,
Does that mean that no32 bd with only James Norris was actually unfinished? and Does this imply that No.32 is a combination pack of James Norris and David? So we're like looking at No.32 BD ? (James Norris+David BD)



Q2. What is David's dad like?
In the end, did David feel like he let his mom down, or did his own version of "climbing the Arasaka tower" make her happy?
Is there any chance that some of the dead crew members are still alive? (Copium going hard on this one)
    We saw most of them fucking explode so most of them are dead for sure, falco and lucy are 100% alive but david has been stated in this thread as very much dead, but death isnt always the end for people in cyberpunk so only time will truely tell (*takes massive copium hit and offers copium canister*)
Why did the team decide to give Rebecca the worst death also rest in peace best girl Rebecca
The colors in Edgerunners were incredible and something I've never seen in an anime before - was there any work you used for reference or inspiration? It was like being in a cruel but neon universe
Hi Mr. Hiroyuki, thanks for doing this AMA.

I‚Äôve been a huge fan of Mike Pondsmith‚Äôs world and looked forward the game and the anime when it was announced. Reading your name as director for the anime was huge for me since I‚Äôm a big fan of your previous works like Kill la Kill or Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagan.

What‚Äôs the biggest difference between your previous shows and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners?

Are there any influence of your previous work on Cyberpunk: Edgerunners?
Good afternoon, Edgerunners team! I have a ton of questions to ask!

\-How did you come up with the concept of NC paramedics? In-game, you only see Trauma Team as the medical service of 2077, no general ambulance service at all.(P.S. Love how you incorporated the automated warning voice from Japanese ambulances into the TTI AVs in Ep 1!)I'd love to drive a regular NC ambulance in the game, I could probably even try to help steer some kid away from becoming the next Martinez!

\-If you could choose any one piece of cyberware or own any one 2077 vehicle, what would you choose? Wouldn't it be fun to commute to your office by AV? Or just a cool unique car you could show off to the others?Personally, the Mizutani Shion is a great option, it's like 2077's Toyota Supra! Or for normal commutes, I'd prefer a classic - the Villefort Cortes. But I'm rambling.. sorry!  
(Edit: Kiroshis are certainly my cyberware go-to. I'm not looking for combat cyberware, I'm not looking to be arrested!)

\-Considering you also work for a Japanese company, what do you think of Japanese megacorporation Arasaka? If they approached you and wanted to work with you on a project, would you accept?

That's all from me, hope you answer soon!
    I'm not Trigger, but it's hard to deny the appeal of a Sandevistan.  Unlike cybereyes, you can just ‚Ä¶¬†not use it, if it's down for maintenance.  It doesn't rely on a cellular network or memory cards that are incompatible with real ones.  It just does its thing when you tell it to, and it can save your life.
Have you thought about any other stories in the cyberpunk universe that you would like to tell if given the opportunity?
The thing that really caught me was your depiction of cyberpsychosis. In the lore, cyberpsychosis didn't have any visual ques that were perceivable and therefore high functioning psychos could live amongst people. The shifting eyes that the viewer could see but the characters couldn't was an awesome depiction and foreshadowing tool that reminded me of the cyberpsycho fight with the girl who was pumped full of drugs and jacked into the net to attract daemons. The one where she kept teleporting across screen slightly out of view. 

&#x200B;

How did you guys come up with that?
How much freedom did studio Trigger have in terms of scenery and script? was a 50/50 decision or was it all according to CD Projekt?
Could we get some shorts to supplement the whole plot? Just like Zootopia+
Which character was the hardest to write the direction of?



All of them felt amazing btw! Kiwi is my favourite :)
Will there be an artbook? I want to have more time to look at all the beautiful backgrounds and designs.
Is there any chance that we might get prequel or sequel to edgerunners

Did David and Rebecca ever have a secret relationship?
Anyone was aware that "I really wanna stay at your house " by Rosa Walton could become such a hit and have an impact/ meaning in the comunity? Most players, including myself would cry while playing the game while randomly listening the song on NC, specially after David's last stand against Adam. And also, what's David's Latin hereditage????
So is it canon that V ended up getting David‚Äôs jacket?
Did you thought Edgerunners would get as popular as it is now?
Just watched the whole series in one sitting, anyone else cutting onions?
Did you had another cyberpunk influence than the game? Maybe Blade Runner or Akira?
How did you accomplish to make the characters personalities so strong, fun and deep at the same time?  
Pd: Rebecca was my favorite character!
What is it that you are the most proud of? Something that looking back you think you absolutely nailed in the show?
Was it difficult to animate and write a script for the organic feel of Night City and it‚Äôs occupants, along with connecting with all the different aspects of the existing lore?
Firstly, thank you very much for taking the time to answer our questions, Imaishi-san. I'm a huge fan of your work, and *Gurren Lagann* is my favorite anime of all time.

&#x200B;

*Edgerunners* has gotten a lot of praise for its soundtrack by Yamaoka-san, as well as the scenes they're used in. However, a lot of songs were also created by other bands for the *2077* video game. Did Yamaoka-san decide where to use these songs? If not him, then who? In particular, the use of *I Really Want to Stay At Your House* in episode 2 and the finale has made that beautiful song synonymous with not just David and Lucy's relationship, but the anime itself. Did you decide from the start that this song would be as important as it was, or was this decision made later?
In the series, we see in graphic detail the death and aftermath of all characters with nothing offscreen but then David is seemingly killed in a sneaky way (don't see a corpse, don't physically see his head blown up by Adam Smasher thanks to a clever scene transition) Was this done for artistic purposes, adding a layer of doubt to things (given smasher said Arasaka wanted David as a construct), or something else entirely?

Given that someone who worked on Edgerunners hinted at working on more "Edgerunners stuff" on twitter after the show wrapped up, what does the future hold for Edgerunners?
    Wait wut, when did they say this (and who)?
        All I remember is the staff member was a woman and her tweet talked about how she had just gotten done some Edgerunners work and saw an ad in Shibuya
        https://twitter.com/elderlarp/status/1579823037150810117?s=19

There
How did you feel when you made the decision to kill off rebecca?
Yoshinari has been working as both a director and animation director on and off,  


Imaishi has been focusing on directing and doesn't draw many keyframes anymore. Does he ever get the urge to draw his own cuts anymore? Is there a chance he will ever do some sakuga kantoku work in the future?
Do you potentially see yourself continuing the series with a sequel or a prequel?  If so, what are your thoughts on that so far?
Would you ever consider doing an anthology shorts? Different settings in the cyberpunk world, different characters, world building shorts that could explore other facets of the world in 2077?
Who would you like to be in this universe if you were there?
Is it a possibility that David is still ‚Äúalive?‚Äù Due to his high compatibility with cybernetics and Arasaka experimenting with uploading consciences and transferring bodies.

Follow up question if the answer is maybe yes. Could there be a season two where Lucy finds out David is ‚Äúalive‚Äù and tries to get his conscience back from Arasaka. And maybe V could be included as a mercenary to help get it back. To help interlock the game and edgerunners even more.
EW's night city setting is well built with a few lores familiar to the game and Top table with precision and craftsmanship unlike any other anime. How often did speak with the game's creators on the ideas that help make the worldbuilding so incredible?
Do any of the characters have any official birthdays?
Did any of you cry while doing the end of the show?
    We all did (offers copium canister)
Okay serious question cuz i cant be the only one who's hurtin, *inhales* Will u ever do a shorts / probably include on s2 (if there is) about Becca and Pillar's childhood or their backstory?

Becca's "I'm the only one could kill him" *spats gum* is kinda disturbing... I'm curious about their childhood and how they became a crew.

ü§≤ please give some crumbs
Any chance for a vinyl with the selected songs from CP:E?
I ALSO NEED A VALIDATION, 

Did Kiwi Did that because she is in her survival mode? Is it correct? Like if she fought back at the very beginning she'll üíÄ and wont be able to help her friends at the very least, but if she cooperates then she'll knew the plan + locations to atleast help before she even dies cuz what matter the decission is everyone is at risk.. kiwi isnt a villain? Pls tell me she is not üò≠üôè
Was there something from the game that you wanted to include, but there was no room for it or it would look and feel out of place?

Also, thank you very much for doing this AMA, and tha k you even more for the wonderful show you gave us! Good luck on TGA!
Thanks for doing this!
I have no question. I just think Edgerunners was outstanding and would like to congratulate you on its success.
To your knowledge, are there any plans in the future for another cyberpunk show? (not an Edgerunners season two) 

Maybe involving another life path?


And thank you for making this great show üôÇ.
Will there be a season 2?
Enjoying reading other people questions. And thank you for the experience. Got me back to CP2077 and about 70 hours in so far
The series is just like the game, the best part is skipped.. I want to play the cut scene after the prolouge it looks more fun then the game. Just like edgerunner when david suddenly becomes a man and chromed out... want to see that in-between.

Also in video game, why do you have no crome at start of game. David got cromed out fast and in game during prologue it shows you doing missions, you should have tons of money then working with padre...

Overall great show loved it.
So this might of been asked already, but before your show it felt like Cyberpunk was going the ways of the dodo bird ü¶§.

 in terms of coming up with a show concept within this world, was it easy to do whatever you want? Was there any pushback ? Or did you have free range to create a story on your own.

Because I have to admit, I think your show saved the game.
Where are the questions that were asked and answered? Saw this too late. :-(
Was the end a simulation? Is the real David alive and will there be a second season where he can be with Lucy?

What was the biggest challenge in actually making this project? What came easiest to you?
Hello! During the finalish episode we see Adam Smasher in what seems like his net icon when Lucy tries to quick hack him. I did some digging with a friend but we haven‚Äôt gotten a confirmation from rtalsorian yet. So we‚Äôd like to know your input! Thank you so much! üñ§ü¶æ

Edit: omg sorry I wanted to say you guys did an amazing job with Adam smasher!!! He‚Äôs my #1 best boy so thank you for keeping up with his personality!!! üñ§üñ§
Any plans to further develop the franchise ??

Who was the most difficult character to create or flesh out?
Are there any plans for a physical release? I love this show and I would buy the blu-rays in a heartbeat!
How was it as a director to make something so uniquely different (even for Trigger's standard) than the usual over-the-top style your works are known for? I know this is too early to ask, but is stuff like gore and the noir genre generally something we'll see in newer Trigger works? Anyways love the work you guys put in and keep going!

I really appreciate you guys making this show! Thank you for your work.

My question is,

During the production of Edgerunners with CDPR, was there any ideas or narratives you had to leave out or change as per CDPRs wishes or did you have the majority of the creative freedom?
If cyberpsychosis is based off of mental health and sanity/outlook on life, if someone with chrome started to shake at stage one but had antidepressants that helped instead of the shot thingy Maine had (forgot name sorry), would it be like what we see in the show as in only temporarily stopping the madness or since the antidepressants worked would it completely get rid of it?
Thank you for doing this AMA, and for all your work on the show!

When choreographing / designing the vehicle action scenes, do you have any particular inspirations? The car chase scenes do a lot to move the plot along, and have such a cool style!
Why Rebecca >!have to die!< ? *cries*
What would you say regarding speculations about Kiwi being neurodivergent or transfeminine? Some of her idiosyncrasies here and there seemed like they might be hinting subtly at one or the other.
    Well I‚Äôm not a creator but I think that‚Äôs a reach and a half.
    I don't think anyone's been speculating about that
Will there will be another season for Edgerunners? If not then what other projects is studio trigger working on? Thank you Hiroyuki-san and Saya-san taking your time for answering my question, hope you have a nice day
Will season 2 ever be a thing? I'd love more edgerunners it is by far one of the best animes and first one to emotionally wreck me
Would you consider making a holiday special for cyberpunk edgerunners?
Did someone really say "the loli must stay" and why is that person a genius? :D
Did david chrome up his donger?
there has to be a continue, because this project blasted everything away, that the game has ruined, and i know that you aren't so stupid to let such a opportunity get away :D
Did you expect Rebecca to be as popular as she is?
Did Lucy steal David's chip in ep1? There do have many people believe this conspiracy theory and I hope you can deny it.
What were some of the things you focused on in order to make Adam Smasher so terrifying?
What is the probability that there will be a second season?

What is Falko‚Äôs profession after the events of edgerunners?
    Professional Moustache Ride Provider
Which character did you enjoy creating the most?
What is Davids heritage? He's Latino but is he Mexican, Salvadorian, Columbian, Hondurian? We know Lucy is Polish and Japanese but theres no real clarification of Davids background so some people assume he's a white anglo for some reason.
It‚Äôs quite common knowledge within the gaming community that movie/television adaptations of video games typically do poorly. 

What do you think allowed your team to be successful in creating an original story that was still very faithful to the game? 

What causes a lot of other adaptations to be so bad?

Thank you for your time!
Are there going to be season 2 ?
why did y'all have to make us cry so gotdamn much?
Can you reveal some of the characters last names? Like Rebecca, Dorio etc... 
Also possibly their ethnicity, like we now know Lucy is half Japanese.
Did you have a budget which kinda gave you only the possibility of producing 10 episodes or was that your vision from the beginning? I like the pacing and packaging of the show but more edgerunners I never would decline. Big time thanks to all of you guys for producing such an amazing series!
Will there be an art book coming soon?
Hello !
First, thank you for creating this amazing show, it was a truly incredible work and I love it with all my heart !!!!!!

1. Do you plan on making OVAs, for example between episode 3 and 4, where we get to see David growing on the team, and the entire crew together ?
2. Will we have merch of the entire team, like figures or funko pop ?
3. Was Rebecca raised by her brother Pilar ? 

(He is my personal favorite, thank you so much so making him !)
After the great success of this series, will it be renewed for a second season, even if the initial project was to make it an independent 10-episodes story?
    Also, would it be possible to see the main characters again? Or would it be a bit too pretentious?
    What I mean is, will there be a second season? And if so, would it be directly connected to the plot of the first one?
There's been speculation on the Internet that neither Trigger or CDPR were expecting Edgerunners to be as much as a hit as it was. Were there any aspects of the series that surprised you in terms of fan response? Any characters you didn't expect to be as positively received as they were?
Who would realistically win? V or David ü§î
    V kills Smasher so that's easy peasy
Is there a book or movie you are might planning to release about and/or to add to first season? (a bit more lore, what happened between ep 6 and 7 , things that didnt made it to the shows final version,and so on)
with the shows short runtime, did you have to cut anything story-wise? if so what?
Can I have a hug ?
Were there any major scenes you‚Äôve left out? If so, what were they and why did you leave it out?
Would you like to personally live in Night City? Why or why not?
What‚Äôs the impact of old school animation movies like Akira or Ghost in the shell on Edgerunners ? We can feel some inspiration when we watched the show
In episode 4, on Pilar's death and Rebecca goes crazy, she screams 'you didn't have the right' and 'he was my kill', Was she referring to the Pillar? Can you elaborate more on this backstory?
I heard a story that CDPR wanted a sadder ending but you talked them out of it. Can you give us any details about how they wanted to end the series?
How old are the main characters? I'm really curious
is the last scene including Lucy on the moon supposed to suggest a suicide attempt?
I was wondering about character birthdays? I'm sure as a fanbase we would love to celebrate all of that! I always pictured David's being in October, Lucy's in June (though i can see hers being a total mystery compared to everyone else), and Rebecca's in December. The rest I'm unsure with my idea. But I would love some confirmation or ideas!
Do you plan to do any crossovers or collaborations with other companies in regards to Edgerunners? Like crossover skins in other companies games?
With Edgerunners having been such a success and having pushed the Studio to some of its best returns in years, along with the clamoring of the fans for more.
Has there been renewed talks about further series set in the Cyberpunk universe? 
I know I am not alone in saying I would love to see more stories with new characters set in this expansive world. Who knows maybe even some about Johnny Silverhand in his hayday..
Either way thank you for creating a blast of a series and doing the Cyberpunk universe justice.
Did you guys ever feel like you just didn't have enough time to do everything you wanted within 10 episodes?

Also,was there any big changes story wise that had to be made during the production?

Like was there supposed to be different deaths, or anything of that nature?


Oh! And who out of the cast was your guy's favorite and least favorite character?
What are the chances of having not necessarily an Edgerunners sequel, but other animes in the Cyberpunk universe?
On Cyberpunk Imaishi provided corrections, but didn't write any episode's storyboard by himself (unlike his other projects ). Is there a reason for this?
Will we get to see more of our David and Lucy duo?
Is there a chance that the Edgerunners crew, namely Rebecca and David, could be brought back for other Cyberpunk projects? 

Edit- Yes I know the ending of Edgerunners, but I‚Äôm holding out hope it can be done.
About the video clip: Sorry to Let you Down that gives us the backstory and fate of Sasha Yakovleva. Is Sasha a transgender character? Some hints can be found in this work, that I a trans person, really associate with.
I got 3 questions.

1. Why would Adam Smasher kill David if he needs him as a test subject?

2. Will we see Lucy again? I hope so because she‚Äôs my favorite character.

3. Is Lucy permanently going to be on the moon? Because there‚Äôs a sign that says ‚ÄúTour‚Äù on it.
Just want to say, a big thank you for making this anime! I dint expect to enjoy this actually haha! Edgerunners contained every genre, it was honestly very well done. Though I had to state there were some lags in the animation but it‚Äôs completely covered how good the colors were used. Really beautiful colour combinations, hyper pop vibe is my favorite! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®
I read this thread. It's interesting. It's good that David is dead. But sad that nothing is clear about Lucy (People with the version that she will die - fuck you). I hope CDPR comes up with something good.
Is David Martinez a Christian/Catholic?

Since Edgerunners takes place in 2076 how come the crew doesn't know about Johnny Silverhand or him nuking Arasaka tower. Also why are Adam Smasher's eyes different in the show?
Will Edgerunners come to Fortnite as a collaboration? 

I even made an account hoping and counting the days ever since I've watched the show!

When is season 2?
    There wont be
Great work! Loved the show.

Did you consider going darker than you already have? Personally, I felt a bit of a mismatch between how Night City is portrayed as an abysmal final stage capitalist shithole, and how "blaz√©" the characters seem to be with all the filth, drama, tragedy, and violence in their lives. They felt kinda "cool" with it to me. So I wonder whether you have considered going darker, as in going into more depth of how the hellscape they live in affects their mental states. Cyberpsychosis is portrayed as an effect of getting more chrome than one can handle, but what about "regular" mental health issues? Have you considered diving into those aspects as well?
Are there any easter eggs that nobody has found yet?
Love the show! Was there anything that was cut or left out for time or would have been detrimental to the story?
How did the soundtrack production come to be for Edgerunners??
Would you consider working on other CD red games like a better Witcher adaptation ?
The use of the game score was great. Who was it that decided when to use it in the show?
Do you know any plan about edgerunners' merchandise of¬†CD Projekt Red or Trigger studio?
I think this show is very succesful, and CDPR & Trigger studio must realease goodies for Edgerunners' fans.
Is Akko gonna show up in season 2?

(dalinkster made me ask this)
What will you make next?
would you work on another anime within the cyberpunk 2077 universe?
Just curious as to how Giancarlo Esposito on the project, did he approach you or did you approach him? Just curious
Any chance of a score album getting released?
How long in advance was the show in production before its reveal? I remember seeing the David Martinez cocktail in the game months before the anime was ever announced. Fantastic work on the show by the way!!!
Do you guys plan on getting Edgerunners involved with the game? Like a DLC where you play as David?
I just wanted you guys to know that I don't watch anime. At all. BUT a friend told me to give Edgerunners a chance.  I was shocked by how much I enjoyed your guys' show.  That was an amazing series to binge on.  And I bought the game to jump back into the world of Night City. 

If your other work has a compelling story just like Edgerunners did, I'll be sure to watch them as well.  Thanks for all of your hard work and for making me a fan. üëçüèª
Is kiwi better netnunner than lnucy?
What is one of your favorite moments of the show and what did you have the most fun working on?
Is Rebecca actually dead (I'm coping even after months)
 Do you think Rebecca would have made a good alternative love interst for David?
What do you want to do?
David becomes an engram?
When you guys were making the story boards for the show was there anything that was cut out from what we got from the final show? If so was there one that you wish could have made it in the final release?
Is there any chance that the Edgerunners characters might appear in future Cyberpunk sequels, perhaps? Maybe a prequel that dives into the gang's adventures before David enters the fray?
Did David get a Mr Stud implant to impress Lucy?
Will Lucy be able to cope with >!Davids death!<?
I have a couple of questions so I hope that's okay.

Did the idea of making the anime come before or after the game released?

Were there any difficulties when it came to producing this? Something production-wise, story-wise, etc.

Why did >!Rebecca have to die!<?
Wikipedia said that maxtac soldiers are former cyberpsychos does this mean that cyberpsychosis is curable?

Was it hard to make an Anime with an already existing world? I can imagine it can be quite hard to come up with a Story in a such lore heavy world like Cyberpunk.
why do you think cd projekt red came to your studio when they only had the budget to afford 10 minutes of animation per episode?
(Imaishi) As we were looking for a song to play at the end of EP2, "I Really Want to Stay at Your House" just stuck with me. Even within the radio music line-up for Cyberpunk 2077, this song evoked emotions that I thought would fit the show.
    Perfect choice honestly, I can't imagine the ending using any other song from the radio OST
        Did they use only song from the radio or other songs in the show ? Because they didn't have to use the ones from the radio no ? 

I just love the song.
            They used quite a few songs from the radio soundtrack in the anime. If you're asking something else, then I'm not sure what
    GREAT choice. Devastating.
        San-devastating‚Ä¶
    Flawless song choice, play the song in a happy scene just to crush us with it at the end
    The right choice was made. I binge watched the show in one day high af and couldn't remember how this song sounded. I listened. Now I'm on episode 4. Thank you all for making this show.üòÅ
    I love how the song gives a sense of ‚Äúlife is just a party, don‚Äôt take it so serious,‚Äù which is incredibly sad and cheerful at the same time
Are there only Cyberpunk 2077 music or some are original songs in the anime ?
    AMA‚Äôs already over, but yes there are original tracks like from Franz Ferdinand, dawid podsiad≈Ço, and Akira Yamaoka‚Äôs original score
(Imaishi) If they approach us with something cool, maybe!
    Thanks for your response
        oh my a possible witcher anime üò≥
            CDPR cant, they dont have rights so its only Netflix that could and we know they hate the source material...
                Nightmare of the wolf was really good
            Based on how trigger handled cyberpunk it‚Äôll be a lot better than the current show that‚Äôs for sure
    I sincerely hope not see more cub round content from you all, Edgerunners really added to the game/world in incredible ways.
(Imaishi) I think all cyberpunk works of the past have influenced me in some way. Evangelion has influenced me on a personal level, regardless of Edgerunners.
    Faraday‚Äôs three eyes reminded me of the SEELE logo from Evangelion
        SO I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE THAT SAW THAT
    I saw so much of Evangelion in this show. In particular, the shift from action show to psychological horror.
Let's all love lain!

(Imaishi) I would like to include more scenes with Rebecca's guns.
    OMG PLS MORE REBECCA ü•∫
    Everyone wanted more scenes with Rebecca and her guns
    Yes a whole history of Rebecca would be outstanding. Or a Rebecca side story, a ‚Äúwhat if‚Ä¶‚Äù scenario would be excellent.

You guys made amazing characters.
    Based
(Imaishi) He meant exactly what he said, but a 'construct' is a concept taken from the game, so please refer there for more info.
    OH SHIIIII
        BROSKI WE HAVE SO MUCH COPIUM MATERIAL
        Of which David politely refused his offer. And then Smasher put a high caliber round in his head.

He‚Äôs gone, choomba.
            ~~That's literally the exact scenario Johnny goes through in the game~~ :p I don't think he's coming back in any sort of living sense but the path is certainly available.

Edit: Nevermind, you don't conclusively see that he is shot in the head. It's weird with the first person view
                Wasn‚Äôt Johnny shot in the arm? He was certainly alive enough to be brought before Saburo to be placed into Mikoshi
                    Johnny‚Äôs memories are not to be trusted. I doubt the conversation with Saburo happened like that, and was probably had after Johnny was already turned into a construct, as he is likely to have bled out and died on the floor of Arasaka tower. We know via Jackie that people don‚Äôt need to be alive to be made a construct, so Johnny could have been dead for a little while before being turned into a construct. 

In the tabletop, he is absolutely obliterated at the tower, his body is shot in half, and Spider Murphy uses a ‚Äúdata slug‚Äù and I‚Äôm not even entirely sure what that‚Äôs supposed to do.
                        "Data slug" is just slang for "chip," I think; Spider Murphy is implied to have a functioning copy of Soulkiller on this one. It's labeled an old gift from Alt, who had developed the program before she was ever kidnapped, and Spider says "sorry" to Johnny when she installs it.

So what seems to happen when Johnny dies is, Spider tries to copy his engram to save his consciousness, but she has to leave his body with the copied engram still installed. There's another story at the end that tells us where his body winds up, but presumably either the engram was still with his body at that point in 2045 or Adam Smasher or somebody took the chip out of his head but left his body in the tower.

I find it hard to believe anyone would bother recovering a chip, personally, unless Smasher somehow knew Spider had a working Soulkiller. The other option is that Arasaka somehow recovered his body after 2045, or maybe Alt copied his engram into the Net during the attack on the tower and Arasaka captured him from there.
                    You're right actually, I think in the scene it looks like he may be blocking the shot to his head / body with his arm, and it definitely hits his arm.
            I mean "whatever choom" can be interpreted very liberally
            Guess we'll see, choom. Perhaps CDPR can implement the ER cast back in some way in the DLC/Orion.

Or maybe that was just the last we see of them, which is also possible.
                Nope he is gone, your are addicted to copium the same way  people are addicted to chrome.
                    I mean, he's dead yeah. But construct is something that we don't know about.
    Oh cool as, I was right about it then
    Thank you! I was wondering.
Well if I was to make an assumption I would say he meant kinda like an engram, like what happened to Johnny in the game. I‚Äôm not 100% sure but I think I remember them referring to him as a construct. So basically a digital version of David they could use to do stuff

Edit: according to trigger the ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù is a concept from the game and upon googling it I‚Äôm like 99% sure that I‚Äôm right and Adam meant to turn davids consciousness into a code like Johnny was
    I always thought he meant it as making David into another "smasher". He had managed to handle all that cyberwear so smasher thought he might be able to become a full cyborg like he had. David rejected that idea since it would mean giving up his humanity so smasher zeroed him
        Nah, read up on Alt Cunningham and the Soulkiller program. 

Basically, the program started as a way to preserve dying consciousness. There's even an item called an "emergency self construct" that is meant as a digital backup of a personality. 

In essence, in this scene Smasher is thinking of Silverhand and his fate, and the parallels to David's situation. 

ALSO tinfoil hat time, but I feel strongly that Smasher is a construct. He's entirely machine at this point, the only part that's him is his "soul". But it takes a special mind to be able to take total or even heavy conversion, and to handle trauma. 
Coupled with the undercurrent of "secret AI cabal that may be possessing humans and running the government" I could see this being special foreshadowing.
            I personally think smasher is the opposite. He's a real person... Who's constantly in a psychotic state. He's a man who has no humanity left, he will kill anyone without hesitation. He is a cyberpsycho, just one that doesn't show the outward symptoms.
                I agree somewhat tbh, that's what's "special" about his mind. 

Even before conversion, he was a sadistic man with a penchant for cruelty and violence. His slip into madness was more of a sidestep.

However he is definitely no longer human.  He apparently has a second, more human body he can use for normal stuff. Which means he's definitely a construct, or something very near. And his whole thing is "metal is better than meat".
        Idk maybe. I think smasher would have zeroed him anyway though, doesn‚Äôt strike me as the kind of guy to make his own decisions tbh. More like a follow order type
            I agree for 99% of things, but I'd argue this (a particularly difficult opponent that gives him a run for his money) might be the one thing he actually does have interest in making a decision about.
                The tech that David was using had been meant for him too, so his ability to resist and use it definitely impressed him.
                    Following triggers official reply Adam was referring to the concept in the game, which turns out is exactly what I thought. It‚Äôs basically a backup of your consciousness, like Johnny.
            Maybe, but he's still a high rank in the arisaka corp so his word would definitely carry merit. If he thinks David could play a similar role to him, the top brass would definitely take note, especially if David had been willing and desperate to do so and how successful smasher had been up until then.
                Following triggers official reply Adam was referring to the concept in the game, which turns out is exactly what I thought. It‚Äôs basically a backup of your consciousness, like Johnny.
(Imaishi) Speaking of things that we wanted to do, but didn't... we couldn't draw David's dick in the show.
    A tragic oversight..
        Society is not ready
    this is the AMA content we come for.
        in more ways than one
    does David have a Cyber Dick?
        he did not seem to have one in the cyberskeleton, yet Smasher's dialog with Evelyn suggests he does. Another way he is more advanced than David was.
            Smasher actually has a separate body for more "human" things. He has engaged in hedonism with that

His general body is effectively a military mecha. He has a brain/CNS container transferred between the two.
                His second body also looks similar to Elvis if I am not mistaken.
                    You're correct
                    Is this from the tabletop? All the info I can find references his OG body getting hella exploded and him just living as a full time Mecha.
                        Yeah, this is Tabletop lore.  When he and Michiko had their fling he was in a Gemini body that resembled a [young blond Elvis.](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Adam_Smasher)
    Ayoooo bahahahah
    Unfortunate.
    Lemme guess. It's built different.
(Elder) There was a similar question about "I Really Want to Stay at Your House" above, so please reference the response there. Also, we were unfamiliar with what 'copium' was & received the following definition:  To "cope" is to deal with a sad situation. "Copium" implies there's some substance to make you cope from a situation.

(Imaishi) I admire everyone's persistence on wanting a happy ending. Please continue creating as much 'copium' to your heart's content.
    Saya, that was the correct term. :) What a great response!
    Here you go, good sir

    Thank you. We will endeavor to heal our hearts by continuing to enjoy your fantastic work! :)
    You don't have to tell me twice, I'm basically a copium factory at this point
Braindances are literal copium
(Imaishi) No, his feet don't have wheels. He just moves so fast that it looks like he's gliding.
    RIP boys, no Heelys canon.
        I feel‚Ä¶ empty
        There‚Äôs cybernetic roller blade feet in the TTRPG
            MegaMan had wheels on heels! Why can't Smasher? Imagine the car chase scenes we could've had!!
        My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
Even if he did have heelys that wouldnt make sense cuz he went sideways right?
    they would've been omnidirectional because future
        We have omnidirectional wheels already actually. 

A series of tapered cylinders angled and set along a rim to make a circle that can roll in any direction.
            true but i ain't seen heely's with those

YET
It was worth a shot
(Imaishi) Thank you, but no. Once we received the final draft of the scripts, we staged the episodes to move towards those scenes.
(Imaishi) EP8. It didn't have as much action as the other episodes, but I still liked it.
(Imaishi) Ooh, to be honest, I hadn't given that any thought up to this point.
    Well, this is auspicious.  You could fit a season or two into that gap, and they'd be leaving money on the table if they didn't at least try to make more!
        They pulled the whole Cyberpunk 2077 intro with Jackie on that one.
            "7 months later..." 

I WANNA PLAY WITH JACKIE MORE!! üò¢
                same, jackie was such a well written character they took him from us way too soon :((
                    For me that fealt like we should've gotten to play that time skip as the streetkid the intro is super short and fealt like it was missing something, a few missions with Jackie at least could've helped with that and make his death hit harder
                Is that a confirmed DLC or not? I haven‚Äôt read anything one way or the other
    It's probably worth considering a single OVA episode ü§î
Yeah they could make another season between those two episodes.
    Lucy spin off of her saving david from other netrunners??
(Imaishi) If there was, I'd like a copy.
    We need one lol
    Same
(Imaishi) If we hadn't considered that part important, the final production would have ended up as a seriously weird anime.
    Paramount should take notes
        netflix other shows too, they didn't even read the books lol
            But what about nepotism and writers who already wrote their own story and just want to reuse the IP and characters 

What about their feelings?
                did you forget the /s or are you actually asking people to think of witcher series writers feelings?
                    What about their pride? They know their story/show is better

    Awesome, thanks for responding!
(Imaishi) He's really dead.
    NO COPIUM TODAY FELLAS
        Or double down and go with engram copium theory, still dead but you can get your hopes up.
            Is him suffering in emergency purgatory truly hope?
                Anything that happened to him at the end is fucked up, dies never achieving anything or captured by Arasaka for endless torture. That's just cyberpunk, I was referring to hopes for more of his story.
                    He did manage to get his girlfriend to the moon and became a Night City legend.
                        Arasaka buries the incident only leaving a legend that amounts to a drink at a bar that anyone can get if they die and a BD warning in some alley, and as for Lucy how long do you think it will take for Arasaka to find her because eventually they will and all her allies aren't around to help her this time.
                            Not just anyone gets a drink if they die. Only those who die in a spectacular and notable fashion. Remember Lucy's words.

"You don't make a name as a cyberpunk by how you live. You're remembered by how you die." David's final ride definitely made a name for him and that's an accomplishment in Night City. Mercs look up to these legends.
                                Just getting the drink doesn't make you a legend, you can get Jackie a drink and I'm sure hardly anyone in Night City finds him legendary. Also Claire just says that they are named after their regulars and you need to die, the best way being to die in a spectacular fashion, mid op would be best.
    Johnny Silverhand is just a cyberghost. Maybe we could hear from David again one day.
        Johnny has soulkiller used on him which is said to be really painfull, shit and piss yourself kinda pain. I did not see that happen to David.
        Adam specifically asked if David wanted to be an Engram. And David declined, which Adam respected.

David is truly dead.
            COPIUM but Johnny, Jackie, Alt.. etc did not wish to become an engram but still became one unwillingly.
        nah smasher turned his brain into a mush
    Is REBECCA actually dead?
        You get a clear glimpse of her brains being spilled on the pavement. She's gone, homie. It's time we accepted that.
            I CAN BUILD HER BACK
                Do you have the technology tho?
                    Enough copium can make anything happen
                        You not getting the reference made me sad
                    We have the technology
    :"c
    Nooooo
    NOOOOO!

Well, everyone kind of expected him to be dead but seeing it confirmed still hurts :'(
    I mean once you mentioned atom smasher I figured most of them would die.  People upset about this haven't read any of the Gibson novels.  I'm mostly upset that Rebecca died.  Great show.
    no no no no no no no there's still a chance he's fucking with us
    </3
    ü•≤
    God damnit !
    You didn't have to answer this question :(
Lmao don‚Äôt make him leave
Well, Johny silver hand is dead, but he‚Äôs still in v, let‚Äôs just hope that they love their wordplay
1. (Imaishi) Typing away at the keyboard
2. (Imaishi) I started drawing in analog, so it's difficult for me to work with digital & 3D art styles. On the other hand, I enjoy it because it allows me to express my work in new ways.
3. (Imaishi) It was very stimulating to interact with so many people who have different backgrounds & preferences from Japanese people.
(Imaishi) The OP/ED was selected by CDPR. All the other songs featured in the show were chosen by us.   


In my opinion, that ending was inevitable. I feel that I've accomplished what I wanted to do in the cyberpunk sandbox.
    we need more‚Ä¶ ü•π
    Inevitable is exactly the word that came to my mind while watching. Tragic and almost unbearable, in its inevitability
        ( SPOILER ) once I saw David shaking and Shit like Maine I was like Noooooooooooo !!!! üíîüíî
        "there are no happy endings in night city" is a theme i feel fits the cyberpunk universe better than any other
        Once smasher got into the plot there was no way back, I knew it.
(Imaishi) We tried to focus on telling David & Lucy's story, but some early scenarios involved more gang warfare, which I personally enjoyed.   


My favorite guns are The Carnage and the Zhuo.
    If the series was longer, I would have loved to see more gang warfare with seeing the whole crew together doing stuff, before it all started to go downhill.
        Events flown over by the time skip certainly comes to mind. Maybe a particularly deadly incident lead David to bulk up the way he did. Maybe they lost more recruits like tripwire grenade guy.
(Imaishi) The characters speak English because the show is set in Night City, but in my mind, I was making an anime where everyone spoke Japanese.
    Thanks for the response and congratulations on a truly awesome series.
    Personally I liked the dubbed version better but to his his own
        same, choom. all the cyberpunk slang and such is English, plus the English accents were more accurate.
    David and his mom have an Hispanic last names and live in a mostly Hispanic populated place so... Spanish(?
        English with some Spanish words is appropriate, mijo
            Of course compa√±ero
(Imaishi) The adaptation of Cyberpunk 2077 was made possible by the fact that it was an open-world game. If the base game is different, I think it would be difficult to repeat or copy what we did with Edgerunners.
    What a perfect response. Because you KNOW people will get mad if an anime series goes off the game's script coughTheElitistscough
(Imaishi) I, personally, haven't decided on anything that happened after the ending.
    There‚Äôs hope guys and gals!
If you do the side quest to get David jacket, Falco says "we" and "us" instead of "me" or "I" meaning hes not alone, and the only other one thats alive from David gang it has to be Lucy... right?
    i don't consider this canon for a simple reason: Lucy would've never given up David's jacket, especially to some random schmuck they never even met, to me, it's just the devs way of saying "hey uh, you want his jacket ? here."
        It's canon by the studio.
            are sure ? it's kinda finnicky to be honest, i mean i wouldn't mind if it wasn't canon, it's supposed to be a dlc item, like the witcher jacket; you're not obligated to have a justification for getting the item
                It's the Falco conversation that makes it cannon .  Also it may show that lucy is trying to move on.


Also it's David that lucy wants not his fucking jacket.
                    Heh, it still looks like a quickly thought up idea by the devs to justify you getting the jacket to me, but then again, it's still minor enough to not count as gospel in the grand scheme of things  


as for your arguments, i'd say people's relation to mementos are special, you could argue that David wanted his mother back, not her jacket, there are plenty of characters that keep a loved one's outfit or piece of outfit as a way to remember them, like Ezio with his father's robes or Jack Marston with John's hat
                        I didn't explain myself on the jacket thing well enough. Night city is all about stuff in general.  In a nutshell, Lucy didn't want his cyberware, weapons or clothing, she wanted him. Another thing she's really into making bd's like Judy, Lucy seems like the type of person to record these interactions and feelings directly on to bd file which she would have to relive memories.

Her having the jacket as you say is important but probably not necessary for her.
                            in the end, it is still up to debate, but i do believe that it's important enough for her to keep, and, at least, not give up to a random bozo she never met
        I definitely agree with you about Lucy not giving up probably the only material thing she has left from the love of her life to some random guy she never met
No, she did not return from the moon.
    i'm sorry but, uh, that wasn't exactly the point of my question
        I'm sorry, I actually just knew that Lucy became a resident of the Moon. I went back to this comment cuz I sounded so ridiculousüòÇ
(Imaishi) I entrusted the English version completely to CDPR, so it was a testament to the hard work of CDPR's localization team.
I also feel that way with the English dub of Castlevania...
    In Castlevania English is the original language. It's made by an American studio.
        That makes sense.
In my opinion, dubbing to Latin Spanish also feels natural even though it has some idioms.
(Imaishi) It's hard to stop thinking about those things once you start, so I did my best not to. I'll look into it.
Can someone enlighten me about what a "Midnight Lady" is???
    Female sexual implant commonly used by prostitutes
        What exactly does it do? I'm sorry, I haven't played the game yet
            it helps you last longer or shorter in bed - it has a pp counterpart called mr studd
                I see. Thanks!
                This is different than the joytoy chip? Cuz that basically makes u go on autopilot.
                    It's the input/output side of things, , vs. the "Severed" effect of the chipped people working at Clouds.

    Oooh that‚Äôs going to cause some arguments online
        I TRIED, PETITE WOMEN THEORISTS. WE WERE SO CLOSE TO WINNING.
            We already have somewhat of an answer from a CDPR employee that worked with them on the show that lists her as around 20. I doubt they were going to contradict that.
            I figure Japanese just doesn't have a word for shortstacks.
        ha perfect to remain unknown
            We still have the "around 20" answer from Rafal Jaki who had input on the show and is credited for his work. That's the best we'll probably get unless the Edgerunners mission kit gives us a specific age.
            ~~the loli must stay~~
                just think about how crucial that was
    You could send so many to jail

I had to scroll so far to find this. This is literally all everyone ever talks about in context of this show, what the hell reddit
    CDPR have already said she and Lucy are around 20 years old, Maine's crew is late 30s, and David went from 17 to 18 during the time skip
(Imaishi) Probably not...

OP: Thank you for your wonderful work. The rim lights are very impressive, but are there any meanings or rules for each rim light color?  
  
(Director Imaishi) There are no rules, but I match the emotions of the scene.
        What‚Äôs rim light colors referring to, anyone might know?
            I think they are talking about theLighting in the scenes blue and dark for death, purble for love, red for violence ect
            It's a style of lighting you can see a lot in portrait photography, you have your fill light to light the scene, key light to light the subject and rim light defines edges from slightly behind the subject. Rim is like another way to say edge, say the edge of a cup is called a "rim", and it'll look like an aura when lighting a person's hair and clothes.

Come to think of it... Rim lights.. Edge lights. Fitting!

And Gloria as a crew member with Maine and others.
    She wasn't really a crew member though, she just harvested chrome from dead bodies and sold it to Maine.
        You can say there was more to the story when Maine actually respected her and more importantly trusted her. And trust of Maine wasn't something you'd get by just supplying stuff.
            It can be if you have an honest and reliable, mutually beneficial relationship over several years.
    Ayo I would love to see this
this is a great idea. so many people want a sequel but don't understand this isn't a series where you can just make a sequel, the story is over and the damage is done, while david's legend lives on. i feel if anything, closest we could get to a sequel is another season or standalone series following a new story in night city. a movie expanding on the timeskip could be a much easier/more affordable way to give fans more content though
saaame dude, i crave this almost apocalyptic setting soooo much
    See you on the moon, friend.
        hell, nah, i'm gonna die
Anyone else think of him as Michelangelo's David? He ends up getting pretty sculpted lol
    While generic: I always thought of David as another Icarus scenario. Flew too close to the tower and had his wings melted by Smasher
Dude that‚Äôs what I want to know, Morgan Blackhand story anyone?
Good question but left unanswered ü•≤
    he answered it in another question. He said he doesn't know what happens to lucy or any of the other characters after the series ends
Given that those arms are strong enough to allow her to handle the moral equivalent of a Browning M2 heavy machinegun from the hip, they have to be solidly anchored to her torso or the recoil from her *fucking cannon* would rip her arms off.
Worth noting a different studio did that music video.
We saw most of them fucking explode so most of them are dead for sure, falco and lucy are 100% alive but david has been stated in this thread as very much dead, but death isnt always the end for people in cyberpunk so only time will truely tell (*takes massive copium hit and offers copium canister*)
I'm not Trigger, but it's hard to deny the appeal of a Sandevistan.  Unlike cybereyes, you can just ‚Ä¶¬†not use it, if it's down for maintenance.  It doesn't rely on a cellular network or memory cards that are incompatible with real ones.  It just does its thing when you tell it to, and it can save your life.
Wait wut, when did they say this (and who)?
    All I remember is the staff member was a woman and her tweet talked about how she had just gotten done some Edgerunners work and saw an ad in Shibuya

We all did (offers copium canister)
Well I‚Äôm not a creator but I think that‚Äôs a reach and a half.
I don't think anyone's been speculating about that
Professional Moustache Ride Provider
Also, would it be possible to see the main characters again? Or would it be a bit too pretentious?
What I mean is, will there be a second season? And if so, would it be directly connected to the plot of the first one?
V kills Smasher so that's easy peasy
There wont be
Perfect choice honestly, I can't imagine the ending using any other song from the radio OST
    Did they use only song from the radio or other songs in the show ? Because they didn't have to use the ones from the radio no ? 

I just love the song.
        They used quite a few songs from the radio soundtrack in the anime. If you're asking something else, then I'm not sure what
GREAT choice. Devastating.
    San-devastating‚Ä¶
Flawless song choice, play the song in a happy scene just to crush us with it at the end
The right choice was made. I binge watched the show in one day high af and couldn't remember how this song sounded. I listened. Now I'm on episode 4. Thank you all for making this show.üòÅ
I love how the song gives a sense of ‚Äúlife is just a party, don‚Äôt take it so serious,‚Äù which is incredibly sad and cheerful at the same time
AMA‚Äôs already over, but yes there are original tracks like from Franz Ferdinand, dawid podsiad≈Ço, and Akira Yamaoka‚Äôs original score
Thanks for your response
    oh my a possible witcher anime üò≥
        CDPR cant, they dont have rights so its only Netflix that could and we know they hate the source material...
            Nightmare of the wolf was really good
        Based on how trigger handled cyberpunk it‚Äôll be a lot better than the current show that‚Äôs for sure
I sincerely hope not see more cub round content from you all, Edgerunners really added to the game/world in incredible ways.
Faraday‚Äôs three eyes reminded me of the SEELE logo from Evangelion
    SO I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE THAT SAW THAT
I saw so much of Evangelion in this show. In particular, the shift from action show to psychological horror.

    BROSKI WE HAVE SO MUCH COPIUM MATERIAL
    Of which David politely refused his offer. And then Smasher put a high caliber round in his head.

He‚Äôs gone, choomba.
        ~~That's literally the exact scenario Johnny goes through in the game~~ :p I don't think he's coming back in any sort of living sense but the path is certainly available.

Edit: Nevermind, you don't conclusively see that he is shot in the head. It's weird with the first person view
            Wasn‚Äôt Johnny shot in the arm? He was certainly alive enough to be brought before Saburo to be placed into Mikoshi
                Johnny‚Äôs memories are not to be trusted. I doubt the conversation with Saburo happened like that, and was probably had after Johnny was already turned into a construct, as he is likely to have bled out and died on the floor of Arasaka tower. We know via Jackie that people don‚Äôt need to be alive to be made a construct, so Johnny could have been dead for a little while before being turned into a construct. 

In the tabletop, he is absolutely obliterated at the tower, his body is shot in half, and Spider Murphy uses a ‚Äúdata slug‚Äù and I‚Äôm not even entirely sure what that‚Äôs supposed to do.
                    "Data slug" is just slang for "chip," I think; Spider Murphy is implied to have a functioning copy of Soulkiller on this one. It's labeled an old gift from Alt, who had developed the program before she was ever kidnapped, and Spider says "sorry" to Johnny when she installs it.

So what seems to happen when Johnny dies is, Spider tries to copy his engram to save his consciousness, but she has to leave his body with the copied engram still installed. There's another story at the end that tells us where his body winds up, but presumably either the engram was still with his body at that point in 2045 or Adam Smasher or somebody took the chip out of his head but left his body in the tower.

I find it hard to believe anyone would bother recovering a chip, personally, unless Smasher somehow knew Spider had a working Soulkiller. The other option is that Arasaka somehow recovered his body after 2045, or maybe Alt copied his engram into the Net during the attack on the tower and Arasaka captured him from there.
                You're right actually, I think in the scene it looks like he may be blocking the shot to his head / body with his arm, and it definitely hits his arm.
        I mean "whatever choom" can be interpreted very liberally
        Guess we'll see, choom. Perhaps CDPR can implement the ER cast back in some way in the DLC/Orion.

Or maybe that was just the last we see of them, which is also possible.
            Nope he is gone, your are addicted to copium the same way  people are addicted to chrome.
                I mean, he's dead yeah. But construct is something that we don't know about.
Oh cool as, I was right about it then
Thank you! I was wondering.
I always thought he meant it as making David into another "smasher". He had managed to handle all that cyberwear so smasher thought he might be able to become a full cyborg like he had. David rejected that idea since it would mean giving up his humanity so smasher zeroed him
    Nah, read up on Alt Cunningham and the Soulkiller program. 

Basically, the program started as a way to preserve dying consciousness. There's even an item called an "emergency self construct" that is meant as a digital backup of a personality. 

In essence, in this scene Smasher is thinking of Silverhand and his fate, and the parallels to David's situation. 

ALSO tinfoil hat time, but I feel strongly that Smasher is a construct. He's entirely machine at this point, the only part that's him is his "soul". But it takes a special mind to be able to take total or even heavy conversion, and to handle trauma. 
Coupled with the undercurrent of "secret AI cabal that may be possessing humans and running the government" I could see this being special foreshadowing.
        I personally think smasher is the opposite. He's a real person... Who's constantly in a psychotic state. He's a man who has no humanity left, he will kill anyone without hesitation. He is a cyberpsycho, just one that doesn't show the outward symptoms.
            I agree somewhat tbh, that's what's "special" about his mind. 

Even before conversion, he was a sadistic man with a penchant for cruelty and violence. His slip into madness was more of a sidestep.

However he is definitely no longer human.  He apparently has a second, more human body he can use for normal stuff. Which means he's definitely a construct, or something very near. And his whole thing is "metal is better than meat".
    Idk maybe. I think smasher would have zeroed him anyway though, doesn‚Äôt strike me as the kind of guy to make his own decisions tbh. More like a follow order type
        I agree for 99% of things, but I'd argue this (a particularly difficult opponent that gives him a run for his money) might be the one thing he actually does have interest in making a decision about.
            The tech that David was using had been meant for him too, so his ability to resist and use it definitely impressed him.
                Following triggers official reply Adam was referring to the concept in the game, which turns out is exactly what I thought. It‚Äôs basically a backup of your consciousness, like Johnny.

A tragic oversight..
    Society is not ready
this is the AMA content we come for.
    in more ways than one
does David have a Cyber Dick?
    he did not seem to have one in the cyberskeleton, yet Smasher's dialog with Evelyn suggests he does. Another way he is more advanced than David was.
        Smasher actually has a separate body for more "human" things. He has engaged in hedonism with that

His general body is effectively a military mecha. He has a brain/CNS container transferred between the two.
            His second body also looks similar to Elvis if I am not mistaken.
                You're correct
                Is this from the tabletop? All the info I can find references his OG body getting hella exploded and him just living as a full time Mecha.
                    Yeah, this is Tabletop lore.  When he and Michiko had their fling he was in a Gemini body that resembled a [young blond Elvis.](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Adam_Smasher)

Well, this is auspicious.  You could fit a season or two into that gap, and they'd be leaving money on the table if they didn't at least try to make more!
    They pulled the whole Cyberpunk 2077 intro with Jackie on that one.
        "7 months later..." 

I WANNA PLAY WITH JACKIE MORE!! üò¢
            same, jackie was such a well written character they took him from us way too soon :((
                For me that fealt like we should've gotten to play that time skip as the streetkid the intro is super short and fealt like it was missing something, a few missions with Jackie at least could've helped with that and make his death hit harder
            Is that a confirmed DLC or not? I haven‚Äôt read anything one way or the other
It's probably worth considering a single OVA episode ü§î

What about their feelings?
            did you forget the /s or are you actually asking people to think of witcher series writers feelings?

NO COPIUM TODAY FELLAS
    Or double down and go with engram copium theory, still dead but you can get your hopes up.
        Is him suffering in emergency purgatory truly hope?
            Anything that happened to him at the end is fucked up, dies never achieving anything or captured by Arasaka for endless torture. That's just cyberpunk, I was referring to hopes for more of his story.
                He did manage to get his girlfriend to the moon and became a Night City legend.
                    Arasaka buries the incident only leaving a legend that amounts to a drink at a bar that anyone can get if they die and a BD warning in some alley, and as for Lucy how long do you think it will take for Arasaka to find her because eventually they will and all her allies aren't around to help her this time.
                        Not just anyone gets a drink if they die. Only those who die in a spectacular and notable fashion. Remember Lucy's words.

"You don't make a name as a cyberpunk by how you live. You're remembered by how you die." David's final ride definitely made a name for him and that's an accomplishment in Night City. Mercs look up to these legends.
                            Just getting the drink doesn't make you a legend, you can get Jackie a drink and I'm sure hardly anyone in Night City finds him legendary. Also Claire just says that they are named after their regulars and you need to die, the best way being to die in a spectacular fashion, mid op would be best.
Johnny Silverhand is just a cyberghost. Maybe we could hear from David again one day.
    Johnny has soulkiller used on him which is said to be really painfull, shit and piss yourself kinda pain. I did not see that happen to David.
    Adam specifically asked if David wanted to be an Engram. And David declined, which Adam respected.

David is truly dead.
        COPIUM but Johnny, Jackie, Alt.. etc did not wish to become an engram but still became one unwillingly.
    nah smasher turned his brain into a mush
Is REBECCA actually dead?
    You get a clear glimpse of her brains being spilled on the pavement. She's gone, homie. It's time we accepted that.
        I CAN BUILD HER BACK
            Do you have the technology tho?
                Enough copium can make anything happen
                    You not getting the reference made me sad
                We have the technology
:"c
Nooooo
NOOOOO!

Well, everyone kind of expected him to be dead but seeing it confirmed still hurts :'(
I mean once you mentioned atom smasher I figured most of them would die.  People upset about this haven't read any of the Gibson novels.  I'm mostly upset that Rebecca died.  Great show.
no no no no no no no there's still a chance he's fucking with us
</3
ü•≤
God damnit !
You didn't have to answer this question :(
we need more‚Ä¶ ü•π
Inevitable is exactly the word that came to my mind while watching. Tragic and almost unbearable, in its inevitability
    ( SPOILER ) once I saw David shaking and Shit like Maine I was like Noooooooooooo !!!! üíîüíî
    "there are no happy endings in night city" is a theme i feel fits the cyberpunk universe better than any other
    Once smasher got into the plot there was no way back, I knew it.
If the series was longer, I would have loved to see more gang warfare with seeing the whole crew together doing stuff, before it all started to go downhill.
    Events flown over by the time skip certainly comes to mind. Maybe a particularly deadly incident lead David to bulk up the way he did. Maybe they lost more recruits like tripwire grenade guy.
Thanks for the response and congratulations on a truly awesome series.
Personally I liked the dubbed version better but to his his own
    same, choom. all the cyberpunk slang and such is English, plus the English accents were more accurate.
David and his mom have an Hispanic last names and live in a mostly Hispanic populated place so... Spanish(?
    English with some Spanish words is appropriate, mijo
        Of course compa√±ero
What a perfect response. Because you KNOW people will get mad if an anime series goes off the game's script coughTheElitistscough
There‚Äôs hope guys and gals!
i don't consider this canon for a simple reason: Lucy would've never given up David's jacket, especially to some random schmuck they never even met, to me, it's just the devs way of saying "hey uh, you want his jacket ? here."
    It's canon by the studio.
        are sure ? it's kinda finnicky to be honest, i mean i wouldn't mind if it wasn't canon, it's supposed to be a dlc item, like the witcher jacket; you're not obligated to have a justification for getting the item
            It's the Falco conversation that makes it cannon .  Also it may show that lucy is trying to move on.


Also it's David that lucy wants not his fucking jacket.
                Heh, it still looks like a quickly thought up idea by the devs to justify you getting the jacket to me, but then again, it's still minor enough to not count as gospel in the grand scheme of things  


as for your arguments, i'd say people's relation to mementos are special, you could argue that David wanted his mother back, not her jacket, there are plenty of characters that keep a loved one's outfit or piece of outfit as a way to remember them, like Ezio with his father's robes or Jack Marston with John's hat
                    I didn't explain myself on the jacket thing well enough. Night city is all about stuff in general.  In a nutshell, Lucy didn't want his cyberware, weapons or clothing, she wanted him. Another thing she's really into making bd's like Judy, Lucy seems like the type of person to record these interactions and feelings directly on to bd file which she would have to relive memories.

Her having the jacket as you say is important but probably not necessary for her.
                        in the end, it is still up to debate, but i do believe that it's important enough for her to keep, and, at least, not give up to a random bozo she never met
    I definitely agree with you about Lucy not giving up probably the only material thing she has left from the love of her life to some random guy she never met
i'm sorry but, uh, that wasn't exactly the point of my question
    I'm sorry, I actually just knew that Lucy became a resident of the Moon. I went back to this comment cuz I sounded so ridiculousüòÇ
In Castlevania English is the original language. It's made by an American studio.
    That makes sense.

-implant description, Cyberpunk RED
Oooh that‚Äôs going to cause some arguments online
    I TRIED, PETITE WOMEN THEORISTS. WE WERE SO CLOSE TO WINNING.
        We already have somewhat of an answer from a CDPR employee that worked with them on the show that lists her as around 20. I doubt they were going to contradict that.
        I figure Japanese just doesn't have a word for shortstacks.
    ha perfect to remain unknown
        We still have the "around 20" answer from Rafal Jaki who had input on the show and is credited for his work. That's the best we'll probably get unless the Edgerunners mission kit gives us a specific age.
        ~~the loli must stay~~
            just think about how crucial that was
You could send so many to jail

Wrong answer.
CDPR have already said she and Lucy are around 20 years old, Maine's crew is late 30s, and David went from 17 to 18 during the time skip

Google translates:

OP: In designing the last power suit David used in Edgerunners and the rescue suit for Promare, how does Director Imaishi plan the design plot? Also, how do you get your design ideas?

Imaishi: I often refer to old Japanese animation and American toys.

(simple google translation for the English peeps)  
  
OP: Thank you for your wonderful work. The rim lights are very impressive, but are there any meanings or rules for each rim light color?  
  
(Director Imaishi) There are no rules, but I match the emotions of the scene.
    What‚Äôs rim light colors referring to, anyone might know?
        I think they are talking about theLighting in the scenes blue and dark for death, purble for love, red for violence ect
        It's a style of lighting you can see a lot in portrait photography, you have your fill light to light the scene, key light to light the subject and rim light defines edges from slightly behind the subject. Rim is like another way to say edge, say the edge of a cup is called a "rim", and it'll look like an aura when lighting a person's hair and clothes.

Come to think of it... Rim lights.. Edge lights. Fitting!

She wasn't really a crew member though, she just harvested chrome from dead bodies and sold it to Maine.
    You can say there was more to the story when Maine actually respected her and more importantly trusted her. And trust of Maine wasn't something you'd get by just supplying stuff.
        It can be if you have an honest and reliable, mutually beneficial relationship over several years.
Ayo I would love to see this
See you on the moon, friend.
    hell, nah, i'm gonna die
While generic: I always thought of David as another Icarus scenario. Flew too close to the tower and had his wings melted by Smasher
he answered it in another question. He said he doesn't know what happens to lucy or any of the other characters after the series ends
All I remember is the staff member was a woman and her tweet talked about how she had just gotten done some Edgerunners work and saw an ad in Shibuya

Of which David politely refused his offer. And then Smasher put a high caliber round in his head.

He‚Äôs gone, choomba.
    ~~That's literally the exact scenario Johnny goes through in the game~~ :p I don't think he's coming back in any sort of living sense but the path is certainly available.

Edit: Nevermind, you don't conclusively see that he is shot in the head. It's weird with the first person view
        Wasn‚Äôt Johnny shot in the arm? He was certainly alive enough to be brought before Saburo to be placed into Mikoshi
            Johnny‚Äôs memories are not to be trusted. I doubt the conversation with Saburo happened like that, and was probably had after Johnny was already turned into a construct, as he is likely to have bled out and died on the floor of Arasaka tower. We know via Jackie that people don‚Äôt need to be alive to be made a construct, so Johnny could have been dead for a little while before being turned into a construct. 

In the tabletop, he is absolutely obliterated at the tower, his body is shot in half, and Spider Murphy uses a ‚Äúdata slug‚Äù and I‚Äôm not even entirely sure what that‚Äôs supposed to do.
                "Data slug" is just slang for "chip," I think; Spider Murphy is implied to have a functioning copy of Soulkiller on this one. It's labeled an old gift from Alt, who had developed the program before she was ever kidnapped, and Spider says "sorry" to Johnny when she installs it.

So what seems to happen when Johnny dies is, Spider tries to copy his engram to save his consciousness, but she has to leave his body with the copied engram still installed. There's another story at the end that tells us where his body winds up, but presumably either the engram was still with his body at that point in 2045 or Adam Smasher or somebody took the chip out of his head but left his body in the tower.

I find it hard to believe anyone would bother recovering a chip, personally, unless Smasher somehow knew Spider had a working Soulkiller. The other option is that Arasaka somehow recovered his body after 2045, or maybe Alt copied his engram into the Net during the attack on the tower and Arasaka captured him from there.
            You're right actually, I think in the scene it looks like he may be blocking the shot to his head / body with his arm, and it definitely hits his arm.
    I mean "whatever choom" can be interpreted very liberally
    Guess we'll see, choom. Perhaps CDPR can implement the ER cast back in some way in the DLC/Orion.

Or maybe that was just the last we see of them, which is also possible.
        Nope he is gone, your are addicted to copium the same way  people are addicted to chrome.
            I mean, he's dead yeah. But construct is something that we don't know about.
Nah, read up on Alt Cunningham and the Soulkiller program. 

Basically, the program started as a way to preserve dying consciousness. There's even an item called an "emergency self construct" that is meant as a digital backup of a personality. 

In essence, in this scene Smasher is thinking of Silverhand and his fate, and the parallels to David's situation. 

ALSO tinfoil hat time, but I feel strongly that Smasher is a construct. He's entirely machine at this point, the only part that's him is his "soul". But it takes a special mind to be able to take total or even heavy conversion, and to handle trauma. 
Coupled with the undercurrent of "secret AI cabal that may be possessing humans and running the government" I could see this being special foreshadowing.
    I personally think smasher is the opposite. He's a real person... Who's constantly in a psychotic state. He's a man who has no humanity left, he will kill anyone without hesitation. He is a cyberpsycho, just one that doesn't show the outward symptoms.
        I agree somewhat tbh, that's what's "special" about his mind. 

Even before conversion, he was a sadistic man with a penchant for cruelty and violence. His slip into madness was more of a sidestep.

However he is definitely no longer human.  He apparently has a second, more human body he can use for normal stuff. Which means he's definitely a construct, or something very near. And his whole thing is "metal is better than meat".
Idk maybe. I think smasher would have zeroed him anyway though, doesn‚Äôt strike me as the kind of guy to make his own decisions tbh. More like a follow order type
    I agree for 99% of things, but I'd argue this (a particularly difficult opponent that gives him a run for his money) might be the one thing he actually does have interest in making a decision about.
        The tech that David was using had been meant for him too, so his ability to resist and use it definitely impressed him.
            Following triggers official reply Adam was referring to the concept in the game, which turns out is exactly what I thought. It‚Äôs basically a backup of your consciousness, like Johnny.
    Maybe, but he's still a high rank in the arisaka corp so his word would definitely carry merit. If he thinks David could play a similar role to him, the top brass would definitely take note, especially if David had been willing and desperate to do so and how successful smasher had been up until then.

    true but i ain't seen heely's with those

YET
They pulled the whole Cyberpunk 2077 intro with Jackie on that one.
    "7 months later..." 

I WANNA PLAY WITH JACKIE MORE!! üò¢
        same, jackie was such a well written character they took him from us way too soon :((
            For me that fealt like we should've gotten to play that time skip as the streetkid the intro is super short and fealt like it was missing something, a few missions with Jackie at least could've helped with that and make his death hit harder
        Is that a confirmed DLC or not? I haven‚Äôt read anything one way or the other
netflix other shows too, they didn't even read the books lol
    But what about nepotism and writers who already wrote their own story and just want to reuse the IP and characters 

What about their feelings?
        did you forget the /s or are you actually asking people to think of witcher series writers feelings?
            What about their pride? They know their story/show is better

Its rude of us to see it as the shit that it is
Fucking fr.
Thank youuuuu
And Netflix
Yeah it might help them if they ever try to do something with Halo!
ITS CANON BOYS!! SHE HAS SPIDER TITS :0
Go now, do the cyber-gods work!
Kimouchiii! *proceeds to eject spider silk cus its one of those days*
CAN WE GET MUCH HIGHER
    #SOO HIIGGHHH
Yo can Fem V get some of those?
Rip David's chrome-cock
Too violent
Bigger, longer, uncut.
Or double down and go with engram copium theory, still dead but you can get your hopes up.
    Is him suffering in emergency purgatory truly hope?
        Anything that happened to him at the end is fucked up, dies never achieving anything or captured by Arasaka for endless torture. That's just cyberpunk, I was referring to hopes for more of his story.
            He did manage to get his girlfriend to the moon and became a Night City legend.
                Arasaka buries the incident only leaving a legend that amounts to a drink at a bar that anyone can get if they die and a BD warning in some alley, and as for Lucy how long do you think it will take for Arasaka to find her because eventually they will and all her allies aren't around to help her this time.
                    Not just anyone gets a drink if they die. Only those who die in a spectacular and notable fashion. Remember Lucy's words.

"You don't make a name as a cyberpunk by how you live. You're remembered by how you die." David's final ride definitely made a name for him and that's an accomplishment in Night City. Mercs look up to these legends.
                        Just getting the drink doesn't make you a legend, you can get Jackie a drink and I'm sure hardly anyone in Night City finds him legendary. Also Claire just says that they are named after their regulars and you need to die, the best way being to die in a spectacular fashion, mid op would be best.
Johnny has soulkiller used on him which is said to be really painfull, shit and piss yourself kinda pain. I did not see that happen to David.
Adam specifically asked if David wanted to be an Engram. And David declined, which Adam respected.

David is truly dead.
    COPIUM but Johnny, Jackie, Alt.. etc did not wish to become an engram but still became one unwillingly.
nah smasher turned his brain into a mush
You get a clear glimpse of her brains being spilled on the pavement. She's gone, homie. It's time we accepted that.
    I CAN BUILD HER BACK
        Do you have the technology tho?
            Enough copium can make anything happen
                You not getting the reference made me sad
            We have the technology
( SPOILER ) once I saw David shaking and Shit like Maine I was like Noooooooooooo !!!! üíîüíî
"there are no happy endings in night city" is a theme i feel fits the cyberpunk universe better than any other
Once smasher got into the plot there was no way back, I knew it.
Events flown over by the time skip certainly comes to mind. Maybe a particularly deadly incident lead David to bulk up the way he did. Maybe they lost more recruits like tripwire grenade guy.
same, choom. all the cyberpunk slang and such is English, plus the English accents were more accurate.
English with some Spanish words is appropriate, mijo
    Of course compa√±ero
It's canon by the studio.
    are sure ? it's kinda finnicky to be honest, i mean i wouldn't mind if it wasn't canon, it's supposed to be a dlc item, like the witcher jacket; you're not obligated to have a justification for getting the item
        It's the Falco conversation that makes it cannon .  Also it may show that lucy is trying to move on.


Also it's David that lucy wants not his fucking jacket.
            Heh, it still looks like a quickly thought up idea by the devs to justify you getting the jacket to me, but then again, it's still minor enough to not count as gospel in the grand scheme of things  


as for your arguments, i'd say people's relation to mementos are special, you could argue that David wanted his mother back, not her jacket, there are plenty of characters that keep a loved one's outfit or piece of outfit as a way to remember them, like Ezio with his father's robes or Jack Marston with John's hat
                I didn't explain myself on the jacket thing well enough. Night city is all about stuff in general.  In a nutshell, Lucy didn't want his cyberware, weapons or clothing, she wanted him. Another thing she's really into making bd's like Judy, Lucy seems like the type of person to record these interactions and feelings directly on to bd file which she would have to relive memories.

Her having the jacket as you say is important but probably not necessary for her.
                    in the end, it is still up to debate, but i do believe that it's important enough for her to keep, and, at least, not give up to a random bozo she never met
I definitely agree with you about Lucy not giving up probably the only material thing she has left from the love of her life to some random guy she never met
I'm sorry, I actually just knew that Lucy became a resident of the Moon. I went back to this comment cuz I sounded so ridiculousüòÇ
That makes sense.
What exactly does it do? I'm sorry, I haven't played the game yet
    it helps you last longer or shorter in bed - it has a pp counterpart called mr studd
        I see. Thanks!
        This is different than the joytoy chip? Cuz that basically makes u go on autopilot.
            It's the input/output side of things, , vs. the "Severed" effect of the chipped people working at Clouds.
Thanks!
I TRIED, PETITE WOMEN THEORISTS. WE WERE SO CLOSE TO WINNING.
    We already have somewhat of an answer from a CDPR employee that worked with them on the show that lists her as around 20. I doubt they were going to contradict that.
    I figure Japanese just doesn't have a word for shortstacks.
ha perfect to remain unknown
    We still have the "around 20" answer from Rafal Jaki who had input on the show and is credited for his work. That's the best we'll probably get unless the Edgerunners mission kit gives us a specific age.
    ~~the loli must stay~~
        just think about how crucial that was
my heart is broken and my **life** is ruined
What‚Äôs rim light colors referring to, anyone might know?
    I think they are talking about theLighting in the scenes blue and dark for death, purble for love, red for violence ect
    It's a style of lighting you can see a lot in portrait photography, you have your fill light to light the scene, key light to light the subject and rim light defines edges from slightly behind the subject. Rim is like another way to say edge, say the edge of a cup is called a "rim", and it'll look like an aura when lighting a person's hair and clothes.

Come to think of it... Rim lights.. Edge lights. Fitting!

https://youtu.be/89ZHtI0dsnc
You can say there was more to the story when Maine actually respected her and more importantly trusted her. And trust of Maine wasn't something you'd get by just supplying stuff.
    It can be if you have an honest and reliable, mutually beneficial relationship over several years.
hell, nah, i'm gonna die
They used quite a few songs from the radio soundtrack in the anime. If you're asking something else, then I'm not sure what
CDPR cant, they dont have rights so its only Netflix that could and we know they hate the source material...
    Nightmare of the wolf was really good
Based on how trigger handled cyberpunk it‚Äôll be a lot better than the current show that‚Äôs for sure
~~That's literally the exact scenario Johnny goes through in the game~~ :p I don't think he's coming back in any sort of living sense but the path is certainly available.

Edit: Nevermind, you don't conclusively see that he is shot in the head. It's weird with the first person view
    Wasn‚Äôt Johnny shot in the arm? He was certainly alive enough to be brought before Saburo to be placed into Mikoshi
        Johnny‚Äôs memories are not to be trusted. I doubt the conversation with Saburo happened like that, and was probably had after Johnny was already turned into a construct, as he is likely to have bled out and died on the floor of Arasaka tower. We know via Jackie that people don‚Äôt need to be alive to be made a construct, so Johnny could have been dead for a little while before being turned into a construct. 

In the tabletop, he is absolutely obliterated at the tower, his body is shot in half, and Spider Murphy uses a ‚Äúdata slug‚Äù and I‚Äôm not even entirely sure what that‚Äôs supposed to do.
            "Data slug" is just slang for "chip," I think; Spider Murphy is implied to have a functioning copy of Soulkiller on this one. It's labeled an old gift from Alt, who had developed the program before she was ever kidnapped, and Spider says "sorry" to Johnny when she installs it.

So what seems to happen when Johnny dies is, Spider tries to copy his engram to save his consciousness, but she has to leave his body with the copied engram still installed. There's another story at the end that tells us where his body winds up, but presumably either the engram was still with his body at that point in 2045 or Adam Smasher or somebody took the chip out of his head but left his body in the tower.

I find it hard to believe anyone would bother recovering a chip, personally, unless Smasher somehow knew Spider had a working Soulkiller. The other option is that Arasaka somehow recovered his body after 2045, or maybe Alt copied his engram into the Net during the attack on the tower and Arasaka captured him from there.
        You're right actually, I think in the scene it looks like he may be blocking the shot to his head / body with his arm, and it definitely hits his arm.
I mean "whatever choom" can be interpreted very liberally
Guess we'll see, choom. Perhaps CDPR can implement the ER cast back in some way in the DLC/Orion.

Or maybe that was just the last we see of them, which is also possible.
    Nope he is gone, your are addicted to copium the same way  people are addicted to chrome.
        I mean, he's dead yeah. But construct is something that we don't know about.
I personally think smasher is the opposite. He's a real person... Who's constantly in a psychotic state. He's a man who has no humanity left, he will kill anyone without hesitation. He is a cyberpsycho, just one that doesn't show the outward symptoms.
    I agree somewhat tbh, that's what's "special" about his mind. 

Even before conversion, he was a sadistic man with a penchant for cruelty and violence. His slip into madness was more of a sidestep.

However he is definitely no longer human.  He apparently has a second, more human body he can use for normal stuff. Which means he's definitely a construct, or something very near. And his whole thing is "metal is better than meat".
I agree for 99% of things, but I'd argue this (a particularly difficult opponent that gives him a run for his money) might be the one thing he actually does have interest in making a decision about.
    The tech that David was using had been meant for him too, so his ability to resist and use it definitely impressed him.
        Following triggers official reply Adam was referring to the concept in the game, which turns out is exactly what I thought. It‚Äôs basically a backup of your consciousness, like Johnny.
Maybe, but he's still a high rank in the arisaka corp so his word would definitely carry merit. If he thinks David could play a similar role to him, the top brass would definitely take note, especially if David had been willing and desperate to do so and how successful smasher had been up until then.
    Following triggers official reply Adam was referring to the concept in the game, which turns out is exactly what I thought. It‚Äôs basically a backup of your consciousness, like Johnny.
Smasher actually has a separate body for more "human" things. He has engaged in hedonism with that

His general body is effectively a military mecha. He has a brain/CNS container transferred between the two.
    His second body also looks similar to Elvis if I am not mistaken.
        You're correct
        Is this from the tabletop? All the info I can find references his OG body getting hella exploded and him just living as a full time Mecha.
            Yeah, this is Tabletop lore.  When he and Michiko had their fling he was in a Gemini body that resembled a [young blond Elvis.](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Adam_Smasher)
MegaMan had wheels on heels! Why can't Smasher? Imagine the car chase scenes we could've had!!

Heh, it still looks like a quickly thought up idea by the devs to justify you getting the jacket to me, but then again, it's still minor enough to not count as gospel in the grand scheme of things  


as for your arguments, i'd say people's relation to mementos are special, you could argue that David wanted his mother back, not her jacket, there are plenty of characters that keep a loved one's outfit or piece of outfit as a way to remember them, like Ezio with his father's robes or Jack Marston with John's hat
    I didn't explain myself on the jacket thing well enough. Night city is all about stuff in general.  In a nutshell, Lucy didn't want his cyberware, weapons or clothing, she wanted him. Another thing she's really into making bd's like Judy, Lucy seems like the type of person to record these interactions and feelings directly on to bd file which she would have to relive memories.

Her having the jacket as you say is important but probably not necessary for her.
        in the end, it is still up to debate, but i do believe that it's important enough for her to keep, and, at least, not give up to a random bozo she never met
It's the input/output side of things, , vs. the "Severed" effect of the chipped people working at Clouds.
"Data slug" is just slang for "chip," I think; Spider Murphy is implied to have a functioning copy of Soulkiller on this one. It's labeled an old gift from Alt, who had developed the program before she was ever kidnapped, and Spider says "sorry" to Johnny when she installs it.

So what seems to happen when Johnny dies is, Spider tries to copy his engram to save his consciousness, but she has to leave his body with the copied engram still installed. There's another story at the end that tells us where his body winds up, but presumably either the engram was still with his body at that point in 2045 or Adam Smasher or somebody took the chip out of his head but left his body in the tower.

I find it hard to believe anyone would bother recovering a chip, personally, unless Smasher somehow knew Spider had a working Soulkiller. The other option is that Arasaka somehow recovered his body after 2045, or maybe Alt copied his engram into the Net during the attack on the tower and Arasaka captured him from there.
Yeah, this is Tabletop lore.  When he and Michiko had their fling he was in a Gemini body that resembled a [young blond Elvis.](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Adam_Smasher)
Arasaka buries the incident only leaving a legend that amounts to a drink at a bar that anyone can get if they die and a BD warning in some alley, and as for Lucy how long do you think it will take for Arasaka to find her because eventually they will and all her allies aren't around to help her this time.
    Not just anyone gets a drink if they die. Only those who die in a spectacular and notable fashion. Remember Lucy's words.

"You don't make a name as a cyberpunk by how you live. You're remembered by how you die." David's final ride definitely made a name for him and that's an accomplishment in Night City. Mercs look up to these legends.
        Just getting the drink doesn't make you a legend, you can get Jackie a drink and I'm sure hardly anyone in Night City finds him legendary. Also Claire just says that they are named after their regulars and you need to die, the best way being to die in a spectacular fashion, mid op would be best.
