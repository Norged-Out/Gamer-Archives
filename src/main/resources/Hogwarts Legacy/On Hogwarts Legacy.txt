[[On Hogwarts Legacy]]


From this point forward all posts about the video game Hogwarts Legacy will be removed. 

We've seen a large influx of cis people coming into the sub for the sole purpose of arguing over the morality of purchasing this title. r/trans is first and foremost a safe space for trans people and their stories. We are not a debate sub.


I have no interest in playing it, but if I did I'd just use steamunlocked
    I am perfectly fine with people pirating it. I second this. 
 
Edit: Honestly I'm even feeling conflicted about people pirating it. It still spreads a property around that gets her more noteriety. Just avoid the damn game if you can please. 
 
Edit 2: I've been getting messages telling me to stfu and other various hateful things in regards to my views on this game. Reddit is refusing to address the messages saying no rules were broken when I report the nasty things people are messaging me. The PS5 sub has decided that silencing people against the game is better than removing posts about it. I even had a conversation with the mods there that basically told me if I want to leave the sub over it then that's fine. It's been an eye opening experience being pushed out of communities and such because a video game is more important to people than not supporting genocide.
        The plot of the game involves stopping a rebellion by goblins, which have been portrayed in media, but especially Harry Potter, to be gross caricatures of Jewish people. The game itself is trash.

Edited for clarity. Also it's not antisemitic to call something antisemitic, wherever that comment went.

        Really? I haven't used it in awhile so I wouldn't know anything. Are there any good alternatives?
    Just a reminder that it's using Denuvo and it has not been cracked yet. 

There is literally only one cracker on earth (Empress) who has been able to crack Denuvo, and there are games that have been out for years that have not been cracked yet.
    Yeah I’ve heard it’s not even that good
        Its good
        It's very good.
        Judging from people I know who are not into potter at all. The game is good enough to stand on its own legs pretty well. Most the people I know who have played it and said it’s not that good have put 120 hours into it. Sounds like sour grapes.

Not my kind of game in general.
    what about viruses?
I’m autistic and Harry Potter has been one of my little special interests for a long time. I’m also a trans person which therein lies my situation. I want to play the game because I am fascinated by the concept of being able to immerse myself in that magical world. But… I don’t want to be seen as untrustworthy or anything by anyone. It sucks… I’m just now sure what to do ;-;
    DISCLAIMER; I understand and respect everyone’s individual viewpoints on this subject (so long as they lack malice) and am not trying to claim that views or trauma responses are invalid.

Unless your actions have a clear and indisputable immediate negative effect on the trans and LGBTQ communities as a whole, I wouldn’t worry too much about how others perceive you. There’s a massive difference between simply buying this game while regularly supporting the trans community, and someone buying this game hoping that it will hurt the trans community (I have no hate for the former and no sympathy for the later). At the end of the day the only judgement that really matters is your own and those of people who know you in and out - someone who barely knows you has no right to make a sweeping conclusion about you and your morals based on something as superficial as what products you buy.

TLDR; So long as you actively support the trans community and fight against policies that try to harm non-cis / non-hetero individuals, I don’t think you have any reason to worry about public perception. Make the decision that is best for your own mental well being
        If you want to play a game but don't wish its creator well, just get an eye patch and a parrot and sail thr Seven Seas.
            My gripe is with the IP’s creator, not the creators of the game. Besides, the only people who will be negatively impacted by pirating are the non-contract developers. Too much collateral damage for my blood
                In this context you not buying the game is effectively the same thing as you pirating it, no money is made either way.
What I mean by this is, if you really want to play the game but not support JK (which I think is fair) just pirate it, you won't do any damage if you weren't planning to buy it either way. 

I personally am not even interested this game or Harry Potter in general and don't plan on playing it, so for me is an easy choice.
        Buying/playing Hogwarts Legacy has a negative effect on our communities as a whole though.
            [removed]
                …Harry Potter literally fuels that shit because JK Rowling got popular off of it. Every fucking transphobe listens to her on these things.
                    The monstrous ways JK uses her billions of dollars, and the utter nonsense that she seems to spout on an almost hourly basis, is a different subject than the game itself. I’m arguing that the game itself is not inherently transphobic, and as a result will not have a perceivable impact on our community - especially when compared to the current issues we’re facing
                        She. Gets. Money. From. The Sales.
                            She's a billionaire. The Venn diagram of autistic people, with a special interest in Harry Potter, within the trans community isn't big enough to make a scratch let alone a dent. I get the mentality of not supporting her at all any very cent counts. But she's a literal billionaire. Them buying it has less of an impact than them not voting in a general election. 

If this game gives them some sense of comfort or joy then it's fine if they buy it. Maybe buy it used if possible but the world is a shitty enough place as it is. Let an authentic person enjoy their special interest without making them feel bad about it. 

To be clear. I'm not condoling everyone buying the game or supporting her at all. But think about scale for a second.
                            She also gets royalties from the amusement parks, Broadway show, merchandise, etc. so I don’t think the cut she would receive from WB in order for them to use the IP will be a massive increase to her current net worth (which is already in billions). It seems we’re talking about two different things here; my original point is that the game itself won’t have a perceivable impact on our community - not that JK will suddenly grow a conscience and use her sizeable net worth in a productive way
                                Are you aware of just how many people are going to buy this game? Gamers don’t give a shit about trans people.

Anyone who replies to this trying to be a devil’s advocate is wasting their time and proving my point.
                                    >Gamers don’t give a shit about trans people.

that's a very generalized statement, considering that many trans people are gamers as well.

Also i hope you are aware that this entire "Buying HPL makes you support transphobia"-Thing is basically non-existent in the real world and pretty much only happening in the reddit/twitter bubble and some gaming websites no casual gamer on earth cares about
                                    the thing is she already has billions of dollars so like will it really change anything if I buy it (i’m not just saying) like she’s already famous and like how is that fair to the people who worked on it who won’t be paid i doubt those people are transphobic or homophobic they just did their job and worked on a game and now they get no money that would suck
                                    Gamer here that gives a shit about trans people
                                Here’s a thought maybe not purchase anything that benefits her
                Not a mutually exclusive.  Hurt can be additive.
                You really don't see how giving money to a woman who regularly slanders our community is harmful? You're full of shit. You're just self centered and playing a video game is more important to you than supporting your community.
            Would you say pirating it and playing it in the privacy of your own home does any harm? It wouldn't add to any financial gain for jkr and wouldn't add to the buzz of the game either.

                The game is antisemitic, pro slavery, and is apart of the IP of a woman who wants trans people dead, yes. I can’t tell you what to do but if you’re okay endorsing a game that involves you putting down a slave revolution to prevent an evil money hoarding goblin who does things similar to blood libel, that’s some interesting taste ya got there. Plus your trans and Jewish friends will see that even with all JKR’s hatred she spews, the people who led development on the game, and you actively consuming content that condemns both groups you are not a safe person to be around.
        very good take.
        I agree with your sentiment. Do purchases have a negative effect on the trans community? I suppose hypothetically, a small one. That being said...  


As I mentioned earlier, everyone out there in the world can't take on every battle for every cause. We take it a little personally because, well, it's personal. Also, we do have allies that chose this is the cause they are going to give time and effort to (thank you, by the way). However, out in the wild good people choose to champion other worthy causes... As long as they're good to us, we have to understand they can't know everything about everything all the time.  


And we have to respect their autonomy as well.  
On the other hand, those people who hate us and put concentrated effort against us, F them. F them right in the ear.
    You can pirate it. In r/piratedgames on pinned megathread you'll find safe piracy sites. Use qbittorent and use a vpn if you live in a country, where pirating could get you in trouble and you'll be fine
        Thank you! That’s good advice, I really wasn’t sure how to pirate it so that was a perfect response 😀

        A lot of the problem people have with Harry Potter is that the ideology behind the world Rowling crafted can’t be separated from her own ideology. Her own bigotry (in the form of transphobia, racism, antisemitism, and so much more) are all rampant in the HP universe. Especially in the new game coming out, which promotes and attempts to justify squashing a slave rebellion.

That, and that she is one of the most active and prominent celebrities, especially in the UK, whose wealth is put towards lobbying against our rights. Not only does contributing to her wealth & IP increase her social capital and influence, but also the amount of money she is able to contribute to legislating away our rights.
            Not to mention one of the developers for the game has said transphobic things too. 

I’ve heard some say the Ravenclaw diadem looks like a reichsadler too given the context of the game
                > reichsadler 

Thing is the imagery of a bird in that position is not exclusive to germany.  
Half the europe has similar themes or similar structure(poland, russia, germany(still), spain until 1800s, france until 1700s, Romania, montenegro, USA and the list goes on and on) .  
Plus original reichsadler  not containing the swastika is dated nearly a century before.
            This is not a stretch
            [deleted]
                Lol shut up and go play your slave master simulator
        The games plot is essentially stoping goblins which are a Jewish allegory from getting civil rights. There really is no reason to play the game
        For me the point of contention is that Rowling donates to transphobic groups. If i buy the game then my money ends up in the pockets of people who want to make life harder for transpeople. Even if it is just a single cent i dont want to support transphobia. But i agree that it is your personal choice.
            Just put on an eye patch and a hook on one hand 🤭, that way the stupid #^**%# doesn’t see a penny.
                Hogwarts legacy has denuvo protection, it will take months, maybe years and possibly forever to pirate the game.
                    Oh god! Even if there wasn’t a controversy around the game, that alone would definitely prevent me from buying it. Denuvo is such a crappy price of software, it creates more problems than it solves. Stopping rant here before I write a novel. Still, denuvo being the garbage it is, there’s a 50/50 chance the devs didn’t implement it correctly and we see a playable version in a few weeks. Or they implemented it correctly and it messes with the game….
        Because she profits off of your purchases.
        Because if you enjoyed the product and you pay for it you are benefiting and giving money to the Creator Give and they might

    You guys were really helpful, thank you! It’s really tough when people are so… intense on the internet. It gets my anxiety up about things that other wise would be simple decisions :(
        I’m also Trans and autistic and plan to pirate the deluxe version, because (apparently) you can HELP the slave rebellion with the deluxe version! I also buy all HP merchandise off Etsy because then JKR isn’t profiting from it and instead genuine fans who disagree with her are! Thankfully, there’s a lot of ways to get around giving her money!
        Hey it's okay. Do you whatever feels right for you. Nothing wrong with either way as long as you don't actually agree with her.

Not everyone will attack you over it although a lot will. Toxic people happen. Knock em out verbally or physically.
            Thanks! I really don’t agree with her, she’s absolutely bonkers and I couldn’t fathom being that delusional. I don’t understand how people can agree with her, or people like her. It’s so crazy.

I try pretty hard to avoid toxicity, especially nowadays when people are constantly mean and out of pocket. It doesn’t make it any easier being autistic, it’s a pain 🫠
                She strikes me as very unstable. I've read her stuff...like what????

I'm trying too. Being trans doesn't automatically make you a good person sadly. But there's many awesone trans people out there. So try not to be too deterred. I've got into almost fights with some others like that... but I also have wonderful trans friends.

I'm also autistic. I was bullied and abused for years and just started fighting back one day. Sometimes you have to be prepared to go to the end and not back down. I admittedly take that to too much of an extreme. You're worth fighting for, and no one should get to treat you like that.
    U can buy it, just be aware that you are contributing to trans genocide in doing so
    You can buy the game on a steam key site or download it on steamunlocked if you dont want to support her and yeah you can like harry potter and be trans theres nothing wrong with that just dont support the author
        How do key sites have keys if the money isn’t going to the publishers/developers?

    There are ways you can play the game without financially supporting JKR, such as buying it used, or playing it through... methods that do not involve spending money.
        This way you can enjoy the game without having your conscience upset at you financially supporting a transphobe. It is also worth noting that she will die a billionaire whether or not you as an individual buy it. So In the grand scheme whether or not you buy it wont make much of a difference on her bottom line
    My thoughts on it are pretty much this, unless you're grabbing something special like a collector's edition, buy it used therefore no money is given to JKR.
    I wouldn't worry too much about missing out on this game. Avalanche Software is not known for making good games, and tinfoil hat time I'm pretty sure they know the game sucks, so they're just trying to use the online notoriety to help sell the game as much as possible before release.

I'm like 99% sure when the game comes out people are just going to go "wow, this game really sucks" and no one outside of the transphobic preorder people are going to have it.

Instead of worrying about people who buy it or putting up notices warning people not to buy it, I truly think if everyone got together and agreed to just ignore the game and not discuss it at all, it would die out very quickly.
        The game actually is great. I know a lot of people were concerned about this before release though
    Pirate it.
    I mean... PirateBay? 

Wait until it is cracked and download it for free. 

Enjoy the content, but don't give this vile, prejudiced had a single cent.
    Learn to pirate it. Pirating PC games is really easy now a days.
    Wait a little while til second hand copies are available.

If you buy second hand, the money goes into the pocket of whatever game store you buy it from, and JKR won't see a penny. They literally buy cheap and sell higher, no hidden royalties to worry about.

It's a single-player story game. A lot of people will buy a physical copy, play it till they're sick of it, and then sell the game to buy another. You'll have no difficulty finding a copy if you're prepared to wait the few days post launch that it takes for gamers to clear it and sell their copy.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with loving the art and hating the views or actions of an artist. I enjoy listening to Michael Jackson's music, but the things he did make me sick. I enjoy watching Rick & Morty, but I hope Justin Roiland's cell mate knows he's in for domestic abuse (assuming he's convicted).

Obviously, it's not a clear-cut one, given that you're indirectly putting money in JKR's pocket by buying the game new. If you buy it second hand, there's no benefits to her though. The game sales are recorded by new sales, not pre-owned. Money goes to her on the initial sale only.
    I sat with a trans autistic person in emotional distress over this very thing today, same experience with the stories as you. They felt the same way you do.

I didn’t give them any advice. Just talked about their feelings and reasons for an hour.

They’re going to play the game.
    [removed]
    if you wait a while, you could eventually buy it secondhand, that way it’s not money going directly to her? ;0; my wife ( who’s trans ) is also facing the same dilemma that you’re in
    pIRACY...
    Bit late but I also have this issue. I'm also autistic with HP being one of my special interests lately and while I want to play the game the prospect of giving money to JK is a bit saddening
    🤓🤓🤓🤓
>arguing over the morality of purchasing this title

You don't buy the game because JKR is a transphobe

I don't buy the game because Harry Potter is cringe

We're not the same.
    I didn’t read the 7th book when it came out because I didn’t really enjoy Halfblood Prince much in comparison to other things I was reading (year I discovered my fave book of all time, Catch22) and felt I’d grown out of it. Didn’t read it until about 10 years later just for nostalgic closure’s sake. HP is fine. It’s *fine* as a gateway drug into enjoying literature.

        Witches and wizards exist in a shit ton of fictional universes. But this level of cringe only in Harry Potter.
    Fell asleep during the first book when I was 9. Really fucking boring tbh
    Same, I read the whole series a while back and I just couldn’t get into it, it was so flawed. Everyone else I knew who read it liked it though so I figured I was just being nitpicky
    It goes beyond JKR too. One of the original designers on the game was outed as a full tilt nazi (exposed via alt-right YouTube channel) and the game is about “””goblins””” stealing kids and taking over the world. It’s an anti-semitic propaganda 101 course.
People can buy the game if they want, but they don’t get to call themselves proper allies if they do.  They also don’t get to pull a surprise pikachu face when I don’t want to associate with them anymore.
    Or when we ban them 🙃
        I like your energy friend!

            1. This was a joke, please don't take that 100% seriously. I mostly said it because there were _non-allies_ who were brigading the subreddit.
2. If you really would prefer different mods you are always welcome to find another subreddit or find a place that you think would be preferable. Our goal always has been to protect the community, not just ban random people that we disagree with, and every effort we give is towards that goal, promise.

            Are you here specifically to say that you bought it? If yes, then that's brigading and you'll be banned. If you're not here to specifically talk about that game and whether or not you bought it as well as the number of people here defending their purchase, then no.

We get a lot of trolls here that create new accounts specifically to say that they bought the game specifically so that they can get a reaction out of people for doing so.

We ban those people. They are trolls. We don't stan trolls here.
    I'm non binary and have hp stuff. I also help low income trans people with name changes through a national non profit that strictly specializes in trans matters.

 I just dont want to give her the attention that she wants. My mom is like this. It ruled my life once and I have better things gs to do. I married a cis guy that's also not overly political. I'm not overly either. 

Do understand the other perspective of abstaining entirely. I have trans friends that abstain.  I don't agree with her but do my own thing.
        So you’re giving money to a person who’s ideals, speeches, and documents have led to real world harm for our community so she can take that money and put it towards lobbying to further erode our rights?

Not to mention the anti-semetic, pro slavery, pro authority undertones of the actual franchise. 

I get it.  Nostalgia is one hell of a drug.  But don’t pretend to not be contributing to the problems we’re experiencing.  My original comment applies to those within the community too.  If you’re going to contribute to our oppression, you are no ally to the community and you are no friend of mine.
            Actually I volunteer at a national organization that helps trans people fund their name changes. I've  done more than a lot of people, and I'm gonna keep going. 

I know some people view it as contributing.  I've nearly gotten into fist fights with really pushy people about that who wouldn't leave it be.

I know what I believe and I'm confident enough to keep going. I'm getting to do what I want with my life anyway and I'm happy with that.

Edit: I see those comments have been deleted. Makes sense.

Edit: No idea why people keep attacking me verbally.

Thank you to the nicer people, I appreciate you. 

I do not care what others think of me. I stopped a long time ago. Nothing anyone says will change my mind. I'm actually a lot happier now with me overall and my gender identity since I stopped caring and following groups because people say I should. There wasn't really any gender related peace for me until I did that.

I read what I read when I want. If someone wants to physically get in the way of that and touch me, they're getting beaten to a severe degree. Same with using the bathroom of my choice.

I prefer peace and try to handle things civilly. Always the best way. But if someone else forces it, okay. I've put that old violent part of my life from abuse behind me but I've sadly done it before and am always ready to do it again if I need to.
                You do you. I refuse to buy anything with JKR's name on it, but I cannot and don't expect everyone to do the same. People should be able to make their own choices without being judged on them, unless those choices actively hurt people. I find it highly unlikely JKR will get royalties from each game sold and she very likely already got her money, so who even cares. I boycott her out of principle, I don't pass judgement to those who don't.

Thank you for helping us.
                Great glad you do all that. Doesn’t change the fact your still financially supporting a woman who wants all trans people dead and has been sited in antitrans legislation. The books and movies are horribly bigoted anyway. Just because your trans doesn’t make you exempt from supporting a woman who wants us all dead

    I don't get this at all. People can like media despite the creator or its origins. I don't think someone is a non ally because of one decision. It's about being holistic. I know gay people who eat at chicken filet a and allies who do to. This shouldn't be as big a deal as we are making it. Besides that jkr didn't make the game. There are still people who were hired to make a game and the money will go to them... not to jkr. Nothing we do will stop her from being a billionaire.
        People who are unwilling to sacrifice temporary gratification to stand with people harmed by that gratification do not deserve to be called allies.  Being an ally and being for equal rights means making sacrifices for the greater good.  Change doesn’t occur overnight.  It happens through dedication and sacrifice.  

The biggest inhibitors of positive change for minority groups are those who claim to be allies yet do nothing to help or worse, stand in the way.
            This isn't about something that actually changes trans rights if we even succeed in a boycott. It is just a single games sales. There is only so much political capital and instead of getting allies to lobby against trans legislation you are making them invest time and energy into a video game. This is at best, frankly, virtue signaling. You get to see who the "real" allies are but have barely done any good. 

Besides you make it sound like hl was attacking trans people. How? The game wasn't out when the boycott was decided so the contents aren't relevant. It's just that jkr is attached very indirectly? So what? If you are into left politics you mightve heard "there is no ethical consumption under capitalism". This is exactly what that refers to. Are you pro Sweat shops? No? Well you should never buy anything that is produced in China because they are definitely made in horrible working conditions. This kind of rhetoric doesn't help anyone. Individually you can decide to do it to be a better person. I'm vegetarian because I believe in animal rights, but I don't go telling everyone who eats chicken that they are supporting animal abuse. People still want to live their lives. There is no 100% ethical person in a first world country so don't get mad at people for not meeting an impossible goal.
                You say this as though I’m going out of my way to harass people.  I don’t care if other people play the game.  I personally consider it a betrayal and won’t associate with or support anyone who does play it.  If someone can’t be assed to make one little sacrifice to show support, I can’t be assed to call them an ally or even be around them.  

It’s my personal decision.  I don’t care what anyone else does.  But I absolutely do get to make my own judgement calls about who I consider to be “allies” and who I choose to associate with.  And people who’s idea of support is: “that’s cool that you’re hormones are being taken away and I totally feel for you but I’mma play my transphobic antisemetic blood libel game now” do not fit my definition of what constitutes an ally.
    To your logic the trans people who play the game aren't proper allies too I assume. They also don't care about trans rights.
        They don’t care about trans rights as much as their own personal temporary gratification.  The same could be said of conservative(read: reactionary) trans people too.
    Goblins are the bad ones. Do you know anything? They are horroble greedy creatures in the HP Universe
I’m totally down with this! The safety of the trans community is of the utmost concern for the modteam and the subreddit as a whole
Why are people defending this game on this sub-
    Self centered people and trolls I suspect.
    There’s trans representation in the game, which is rare in the video game industry. Games like this actually help the conversation. The game doesn’t allow gender choices like male/female options on character creation. Why so much QQ over royalties?
    Mix of self centered people and people with actual points.

As an example. I see the whole thing as a total win for rowing in my country. Japanese people are more or less unaware of the whole Rowling controversy and the first indication they are getting of it is people sending them death threats
And sexual assault threats over playing a game with no explanation.

This has literally set trans rights back a good 10 years in some areas were language Barrier is an issue.

        Congrats on rewarding antisemitism and transphobia.
            I think it's pretty antisemitic to look at fantasy goblins and say they remind you of Jewish people and stereotypes😭
My take on it as a transgender woman, is I dont care either way if you play it or not what's not ok is bullying people who do especially if it's a streamer you are familiar with and know their view points on the matter don't bully them into not playing it it sets a bad light on this community and it hurts the streamers, I've seen streamers communities fall apart per this game because half of them want the streamer to play the game simply for fun and the other half is bullying for "transphobia" and the other thing is playing a game doesn't make you transphobic or a Nazi. I've seen a lot of streamers taking the best route and donating money made on the stream to trans help foundations and I think that's great but they shouldn't have to do that just so the can play the game and for what it's worth I am playing it and enjoying it because I always separate the art from the artist because otherwise it's impossible to enjoy anything in this world I know this has been long winded my point is whatever you're opinions on the game are please please please stop the bullying to the people who are just playing it for fun.
    My ideas exactly, thank you. It’s so unfortunate that I’ve heard some streamers are ending their streaming careers or “graduating” (if that’s the correct term for it) because of all the bullying.
Tbh if people wanna play the funny wizard game let em

I personally don't take offense to it I'm more offended when other people make jokes regarding the trans community being soooo offended that people buy it,.  It's a game at the end of the day
    I feel the same dude
        Not a very common opinion when I talk about it tho
    Agreed.
    Glad to know I’m not the only one who calls it “The Funny Wizard Game”

    FWIW I do understand and it breaks my heart.  I don't think SHE even realizes it (this is NOT a defense of her), which honestly makes it even more dangerous - people who don't truly grasp the damage they are causing tend to cause way way more.

I don't personally face a lot of problems, socially.  I'm autistic but "high functioning" (ie: employable/exploitable :P ), I'm bi but that might as well be straight when you're white and cis most days.  I wish I was more femme (I'm cis, again, but I wish I could pull that femboy aesthetic.  Genetics did not help me there) but that's a personal thing.  So I can't really relate to what y'all face...  


...but I hope it means at least something when I say I try to be vocal and disruptive against people who want to hurt you and crave a more peaceful world for everyone.  I hate what is going on these days.  It's just so... dumb.
I suggest for those who want to play it on PC and not support JK Rowling to learn how to torrent. If I eventually decide to buy it, I’ll get it through other means and load it on my Steam Deck. Fuck TERFS
    Isn’t that illegal? I’d just be afraid to get in trouble
After learning about the plot I doubly don’t want to buy it. I don’t understand why the devs think we would want to stop a rebellion of an oppressed group, it’s just horrible.
    That’s what I find so funny everyone is focused on the supporting J K Rowling bit but like why would I want to play a Harry Potter game where I’m the bad guy?
My go to argument with anything HP is pretending I've never heard of it before. They try to explain it and I'll still act like I've never heard of it before. If I could extract all memory of it I would.
I'm fine with people pirating everything Harry Potter related from now on since I know people were already fans before she showed her true colors. But yeah fuck ever giving money to anything she's involved with again. 
 
Edit: I'm having reservations on even telling people to pirate this game. Mods can you please just ban people from this sub that are supporting this game? They clearly don't respect the trans community.

Thank you for standing firm on this being a safe space
The Hogwarts Legacy discourse proves that some people really just don't GAF about trans people. No matter how much people point out the bigoted themes of the game or how buying the game financially supports JKR, making her feel validated in her view points in the sense that, well, they can't be *that* bad if people are still supporting her work, and emboldens her to spew more transphobic rhetoric, some people are just deadset on playing Hogwarts Legacy, if only just as a way to dunk on trans people. At the very least, you'd think the sheer amount of bugs and glitches and overall mediocrity of the game would be enough to dissuade people from playing it even if they don't care about supporting a bigot. But no, apparently personal entertainment and childhood nostalgia takes precedence over being an ally to marginalized groups of people. 🙃 I've even seen some trans people say they're still going to play the game in spite of the game's connection to JKR which?? Really clowning yourself as a trans person buying a game that's tied to a transphobe, but alright.

For people who have a personal attachment to the series, I get that Harry Potter is an important part of a lot of people's childhoods and younger years--hell, it was for me in middle school, being obsessed with HP was practically my personality--but is childhood nostalgia and entertainment really more important than standing by a group of people that continue to be targeted by the rhetoric of a known bigot who uses her fame and fortune to suppport anti-trans groups that further marginalize and stigmatize trans peoples' existence, including your own if you are a trans person that likes HP? If you're really deadset on consuming media that contains magic and sorcery and spellcasting, there's plenty of media available that can fill that niche that aren't headed by a shitty transphobe. If the available media we have already isn't to your liking, there's also the option to make your own world of witchcraft and wonder. I'm not saying you should aim for the same level of success of HP did or anything, you don't even have to share it with others if you don't want to, but there's ways to get your magical kicks that don't involve supporting a bigot.

Idk. I just wish people gave more thought to this sort of thing and not act like it exists in some type of vacuum.
Thank god. I was tired of hearing about it from cis people and trans people. God people learn to see when you are trying to be manipulated. DONT ENCOURAGE ARTISTS AND AUTHORS WHO SEE US AS PREDATORS. it’s that easy.
Don’t even pirate the game. The plot surrounding goblins is incredibly antisemitic. Jewish people have pointed it out multiple times now. Do not play the game.

Week old post, but if anyone does want to discuss the game, /r/gamingcirclejerk is based on the matter, and it seems to be a sub where lots of trans gamers are hanging out.
    That sub is comepletely insuffarable though. Dont get me wrong, i have no intention of buying the game, but even if you mention you are buying it (and not in a mean spirited way, just an neutral way) thats an immediate ban. And theres lots of other stuff like that too. Alot of people are talking about boycotting the game specifically to hurt her wallet. I pointed out that boycotting the game because you dont want your money to go to a terf is perfectly fine, but it probably wont hurt her much financially. She actually gave away so much money to charities that she lost her billionaire status so money doenst seem to be her main drive anyways. Immediate ban. Theres no discussing anything with those people. Either you agree with their (mostly rabid) takes or youre banned. And while thats true for many subs what actually sets gcj apart is that even if you do agree with them, but not in the same rabid way that they do then youre also banned. Theres also some weird shit going on that if you speak against russia (in the russia-ukraine conflict) you can also get banned (i suppose because the sub hates the usa, so anyone anti usa automatically becomes the good side while they blatantly ignore that life for trans people in russia isnt great either). Its all really weird. If you want to save yourselve some beaincells dont go there.

    Because money is going to someone who slanders our community. Please don't buy this game.
        [removed]
Personally I can separate the art from the artist and I don’t mind that people play it but when they go after trans people specifically it’s annoying
I'm just gonna wait til I can by it second hand. Have a huge backlog as it is (welp).
Counter suggestion: set up automod to lock and then comment on such posts with a prewritten admonishment for anyone in favor of buying or even pirating the game.
    Not a bad idea, though I'd prefer they just disappear and not show up in our modmail to complain.
        Can you just ban people supporting this game? I think that would help clear this sub of some trolls posing as allys and stuff.
            We do.

We ban an absolute crap ton of people every day. I promise it's not just limited to people shouting the n word 50 times either, we're very strict about our sub being a safe space for people.
                I'm sorry if I came off as hostile towards you in any way I know the mods are doing their best. Thank you for what you do. I'm just frustrated seeing people supporting this game here of all places.
                    Yeah, same here on the frustration part, and no worries, I didn't take that as hostile <3. I'd suggest reporting people who openly support it first, it allows automod or us to pick it up much faster than sending messages, but I figured out what you were talking about anyways.

<3
                        Sounds good. Thank you for what you do.
                You aren't even banning the people supporting this game in this thread.
                    Please give me a break, I've been really busy lately <3
I don’t understand the people advocating still playing this game, especially given the political climate in the states.  These people are attempting to strip our rights and ban us from existence and TERFS like JK Rowling are literally queens of all things vile against slandering our community.   There are a million games out there similar and I’m sure far better than this one, but most importantly if you give her money she is gonna spend it on our annihilation.

FFS people wake up.   Patronizing her products are the equivalent of self funding our own destruction.
    Whenever I come across controversies like this, I always try to steelman both sides. Issue I've found is that the best argument for buying it is 'well, everyone gives-in every once in a while', but that doesn't come close to justifying the purchase, even if piracy wasn't an option. It only justifies not excessively stigmatising people for buying it but, even then, you could just clap-back with 'just pirate it'. 

I think it's pretty hypocritical if I got all purist about it and pretend like my shit doesn't stink, because nobody is a paragon but, at the end of the day, it's still supporting a FART. 

Asking people to give-up mobile phones because of the slavery involved in producing them is quite an ask because of how mandatory they are to modern life, but this is a single video game. It's not even multiplayer. It's completely missable and nobody's lives would be much different and, again, it's piratable. Paying for it is just taking the worse of two options.
What if there was a way to do a huge charity drive with a bunch of twitch streamers and all the proceeds went to charities that support trans folk? Specifically with the goal to meet/exceed the profit of the game?
    [removed]
I may as well mention, [Ikenfell](https://store.steampowered.com/app/854940/Ikenfell/) is a wizard school game with good queer representation and it's on Steam for, like, 20 bucks. Just letting y'all know...
Ah well, looks like the majority of trans people feel that purchasing the game would be harmful to them. 

I work in a lot of trans inclusive spaces and I am a counselor in training so I do really care about the community.

I came here to see how the community was feeling about the game (not that reddit can speak for the entire trans community) because to be honest I really wanted to cast some wingardium leviosa in a world that I grew up with, but ultimately if my playing is gonna make a trans person feel like they lost an ally or do harm to the community, then I will play something else. 

Oh well.

Neat. It's fun in the circlejerks but not here.
Thank god
Honestly I will play the game but probably pirated. I love the wizarding world (the fandoms Version, not jk rowlings because has horrible world building and is a bitch) so it sounds fun. 
As long as I dont pay for it...
At least now I'll be able to free up my feed on YouTube as creators I used to respect release videos justifying their reasons for buying it. One down...
hey. hey trans people. 

friendly reminder: the issue with the game is not only jkr's transphobia. IT'S ANTISEMITISM. 

it's NOT okay to pirate the game either. unless you're just super chill and down with antisemitism and you love it when jews are oppressed. which would make you a pretty shitty person. 

please, stop conveniently forgetting and ignoring the antisemitism.
A lot of thanks. I just notice the uptick of hate on a LOT of other subs because they do not block that. On subs that should usually be irrelevant to the topic, but even on subs that are supposed to be supportive or catered to trans people see a lot of vile comments and posts nowadays. Having a safe haven is really important, especially now.
Ooff, just got a taste of how touchy and defensive people can get about the wizard game; someone posted something about, and when I said that shouldn’t, pointing out that Yasmin Finney is trans, RTD is a vocal trans ally, and that even if they didn’t care about that, it was antisemitic to boot, I got downvoted a ton. Someone tried to quote in defence a line by The Doctor about how the clothing Donna was wearing was probably made by slave Labour, conveniently forgetting it was in an episode that they acted to stop slave Labour. I’m pretty sure the point RTD was making there was that you can’t stop all that’s wrong in the world, but you can help stop some.
    What does RTD stand for? O:
        Looking back, I completely left out the context that this was in a Doctor Who sub


Russell T Davies, the returning showrunner of Doctor Who, so yeah by saying they don't think trans rights are not that big of a deal, their attacking one of the shows new stars and the opinions of the person running their favourite show (and who is absolutely not shy about sharing his political views IRL or in his show)
            Oh shit, ty, I wasn’t sure if I was just dumb or if context would clear it up. 😂
And please don't harass any streamer or youtuber who plays it! Yes, it's a shitty choice on their part. But nobody deserves that.

We as a group are getting blamed and are going to continue to get blamed for any harassment no matter what, but we as individuals can at least make sure we're actually innocent, actually better than the chuds and the gamergaters.
Jk Rowling isn’t making money from this though. What exactly about the game is so offensive. Why are people so up in arms about it. I thought id have to worry about redneck hillbillies but it looks like i have to worry about the trans community. Im trans myself and i feel more like an outcast with this community than any other. Can you’ll just not chill out and let people be themselves and do what they want. Practice what you preach. Let people do what they want.
    Its simple. Trans people asked allies to not buy the game in solidarity with them against a strong voice of anti trans activism. Many Allies decided that they could not give up a game to show their support for trans people. Thats the distilled simple way to look at it.
I was going to post about it, but seeing this post I hope I'm allowed to comment here. Not looking for a debate, just advice.

I have a dilemma with the new Harry Potter game.

I'm going to add a disclaimer here:

I'm not asking for justification in buying this game. Nor am I discrediting those who oppose it. I'm looking for some advice in an awkward situation.

I know how everybody feels about it, but please, go easy on me. I need some help. 

I am a trans woman. My wife was born female and is currently presenting that way.

My dilemma is this: my wife lives and breathes harry potter. She doesn't support what the author says and does, but she grew up reading it, watching it, etc. Her mom has a friggen harry potter "room" (really just a crawl space under the stairs).

When she was pre-teen, she was disappointed that she never got a Hogwarts letter, so in her 20s her mom got her one, explaining why she never got one (think, a letter from the tooth fairy apologizing for forgetting your quarter)

For me, I would have a really hard time asking her not to buy it. And I don't even necessarily want to take that away from her, but I despise the author, and I don't want to put money in her pockets.

BUT, I can see the other side too. If it turned out that the Spider-man creator was a massive vocal transphobe, and people told me not to buy Spider-man games, or watch the movies I would be crushed.

Has anybody had a similar situation with their partner? 

Again, my intent is not to support the author, or promote buying this game. Rather, I need some advice for how to proceed.
    I'm in a similar but different boat. I'm a trans woman, and my best friend, as well as roommate, is a queer, Jewish, cis woman who absolutely adores Harry Potter. Hell, when I met her, she had on a Harry Potter shirt and jean jacket, which did give me quite a bit of pause at first, but she was and is a delight, so I brushed off my apprehensions. Also, she knows how I feel about Joanne, and she feels the same way. But I have never known a better friend or ally in my life, and I don't want to take her happiness away from her. I did ask her, however, to pirate it rather than purchase it. One, because of the Joanne issue, which affects me, and two because of the anti-semitism inherent in the game that affects her. And she agreed to that, especially since she has some reservations herself. Anyway, I hope this helps.
    If you don't mind dabbling in the dark arts there's certainly one option where you can have your cake and eat it too 🏴‍☠️your wife will have to be a bit patient though.
        Yeah, I straight up would have done that if we had a pc. Unfortunately I'm stuck on playstation and switch.
            Ah damn that does make it difficult :/ one idea if you can afford it is maybe donating the same amount to charities/organisations fighting for trans rights?
                That's a good idea. I'll see what local orgs I might be able to donate to

Love you mods thank you
    Love you too 💜
what about me a trans girl asking for advice on how to handle my trans partner buying the game? because personally it bothers me alot but i wanted to hear peoples opinions here
    she keeps jumping through some hella mental gymnastics to make herself not feel like a bad person for buying the game. and she constantly wants to talk to me about it but anytime she brings it up or mentions it i get really angery. i just want to enjoy being around my girlfreind again
You are not a bad person person if you play this game, your a bad person if you play this game out of “spite” towards the Trans community and make it your mission to let all of us know just how horrible we are because some absolute insane lunatics are going around bullying and harassing people for playing The Funny Wizard Game. One of my Best friends who was one of the first people I told I was trans, has told me that he kinda wants to play it and have I cut communication with him? No. Have I harassed him? No. Do I think he’s transphobic? NO! If you want to play The Funny Wizard Game then go right ahead, as for me I’ll just stick to 2K and MLB the show. XOXO
    This. ^^^^^ I mean I played the game because I personally thought it was kinda fun and after watching other people's playthroughs and sort of fell for Sebastian Swallow and Ominis's questline (I'm spoiling myself but after Cyberpunk, I prefer waiting before buying), I thought it was good enough to buy. Of course, other people will have qualms or reservations with playing the game and that's fine, too. 

It's been a month now and it looks like the drama has largely died down. Millions of people have bought and played the game and it seems like all that drama you were saying is nowadays confined mostly to the Vtuber Twitter space. Personally I'm not into Vtubers since I don't get their appeal, so Imma not try and dip my toes in something I'm not even a part of in the first place. 

It's a funny wizard game. Not everyone will like it. Play it, don't play it. It's been a month and personally, I think everyone's tired of talking about the drama now.
    This whole thing has been a total disaster outside the English speaking world. Most Japanese people as an example are total unaware of any issue with Rowling whatsoever and the antisemetic part is largely lost on them, knowing basically nothing about that either.

So the first take they get on the whole thing is people sending them death threats and threats of sexual assault for playing a game with no deeper explanation to be seen.

This has literally set back trans rights and social views 5-10 years in Japan. And a total win for Rowling all around…
can someone explain to me whats bad about Hogwarts Legacy to me please?
    It's mainly towards JK Rowling, The creator of Harry Potter and the comments she has made over the years. Not saying there isn't some issues with the harry potter setting itself but most of the vitriol is linked towards JK.  She profits off of any media based of the Harry Potter IP. Though she does and will make more money off of other aspects off that brand than from HL solely.
    Its simple. Trans people asked allies to not buy the game in solidarity with them against a strong voice of anti trans activism. Many Allies decided that they could not give up a game to show their support for trans people. Thats the distilled simple way to look at it.

Also if the game does not have the word trans as an option (south park managed it without issue in their games)  then no, we arent repped in character creation. They are using the same sliders that games used in the 90s and want to hope its a get out of jail free card from criticism of the IP owner.
(Im a trans woman I think I need to explain that before I say this) I’m fine with people buying it and playing it just let people enjoy their games. If we didn’t want to support bad people we would let be able to buy anything at least that’s what I’ve come to learn in life. I may be more laid back and stay out of the news but right now trans people in multiple states may or may not lose their choice of expression and medical care. I think we need to focus on what really matters because in the grand scheme of hardship loss and tragedy we’ve through as a community. You can care but I personally believe we can put that effort into the big things that make differences to our future community members in the world.
    I agree, and let me first say I am really not hoping for this, but I believe all of this drama will have some kinds of consequences towards the trans community like you said. I also feel like saying people that buy the game aren’t allies anymore would make those who actively support the trans feel like worse towards them, after supporting them for so long and just getting told they are doing the opposite for doing one thing that they enjoy. Not everything is done in malice.
i genuinely won't care if someone i knew played the game. i personally dislike the series so i'm not interested nor am i interested in watching streamers play it.

but one thing i do care about is when people get harassed for it. it ranges from uncomfortable to downright bullying and sometimes even vile comments.

is it really necessary to harass random streamers and drag them into the identity politics that we were dragged into? is it really necessary to drag everyone possible into the mess that we were dragged into? the world is just starting to come together while a very dangerous, vocal minority is trying to divide everyone back up, is it seriously the time to divide everyone further?

liking HP doesn't make someone transphobic or antisemitic. transphobes and nazis would continue to be transphobes and nazis, the series is just a convenient cover. 

if everyone who likes HP is labelled as a transphobe, everyone who uses any DC power supplies(like a battery or your phone charger for instance) condones electric chairs and animal abuse since thomas edison used electric chairs and animal abuse to get his point across.
After hearing what the game consists of, there's no way I'd be able to play it without being absolutely disgusted.
    Yall the whole concept of the game is killing a race of people heavily based off of jews?? Its a disgusting concept!
    [removed]
Just pirate it… I personally am in the same position. Harry Potter has been a major part of life. It filled me with so much joy. I do not condone piracy but if you want to play the game and be spiteful it is an option 🤷🏼‍♀️
I just wanted to pretend I'm Harry Potter..

    cuz JK is transphobic

    The issue is that 99% of these posts have been from cis people who have shown no interest in actually having a discussion about the topic. They come here either to

A. Seek validation from trans people that it's ok to buy the game and get in arguments when people disagree with them

B. Only to troll and pick fights with people. 

There are other more appropriate subs than r/trans for this type of discussion.
    I've yet to see a single cis person coming to trans people "to have a dialogue" what I have had though is a lot of people arguing with me and belittling me. The game doesn't look that great in my opinion based on the trailers and my experience with other games and at best is a wait a see title not a day 1 purchase title. So even ignoring Rowling I still wouldn't be buying the game day 1. I still don't want to see daily posts about the game, especially from anti-trans trolls.
Good call.
I know I’m late to the party, but people are literally working on a crack so you can play it for free.

If people wanna play the game so badly they can wait another fortnight.

I mean, I guess not everyone has a computer and want to play it on other platforms. But, you know what? I’ve seen the specs on the game, it’s discriminatory against console users, same price and a guaranteed worse experience with it than what people with high end PCs will get. 

If you disagree with me just play the Witcher again and see what happens when you don’t choose to fuck Triss Marigold.
    Honestly, it has some pretty horrible performance issues on PC currently. Console players are probably having a better experience.
Can someone please explain to me how this game is transphobic I still don't understand

I have a serious question. Why is this game be boycotted? I am not 100% sure what the reason behind it is and I’m just curious.

    It’s a game made by people who want our rights taken away. Fuck off.
EH im on the train of thought that yeah jks opinions are an extremely bad take but shes also a middle aged white woman from england.

shes not burning crosses on lawns, shes not actively drive by hitting trans rights activists with a baseball bat in the back of a pickup, shes not actively doing any "Harm" outside of a poorly thought out tweet on why wizards of yee olden day shat themselves and just magiced it away

if a few of my dollars get into her hands then she can finger herself with it for all I care. Bad takes are bad takes, hate crimes are hate crimes.

I take her about as seriously as a threat as a Chiweenie in a tootoo
    She has donated a considerable sum to terf organizations.

Is there a sub we can go into to make post about it? A bunch of my friends are playing it and I just kinda wanna place to vent
    r/TransyTalk is where I go for my vent posts
        I’ve never heard of that sub before I’ll take a look. Thanks. 💜
My take on it: but the game if you want to, she’s made her money already and if you want to play the game go ahead. If you have a problem with the ethics of playing this game, either buy the game and make an equivalent donation to a pro trans organization or just pirate it
Augh. My take is if anybody wants to play it despite the ragingly antisemitic plot, they better pirate it.  I'm tired of transphobia being centered in the discussion of JKR's Harry Potter books when transphobic is the only thing the books aren't. It's frustrating that goyim white cis mostly men keep telling me I'm dramatic for this.
Thank freaking God too many of these posts
This is probably the best move, there's so much dispute over it it's not even worth it
I’ve been pretty down on the whole thing to the other side of the issue.

Most Japanese people are unaware of Rawlings issues. And the first thing they are hearing about it are when they get death and rape threats from people for playing a game with no explanation as to why.

This has set the trans discussion back a good 5-10 years in Japan.

We need to get a handle on our “Allies” In some areas people.

    Respect the people who belong here. If you're confused what that means, here's a minor primer:

    No asking to date trans people or otherwise meet up with them.

    No treating being transgender as a mental illness or as being lesser in any way.

    No arguing with trans people about their identity.

    No arguing with trans people about their vulnerabilities, including anything related to sports, laws, etc.

And anything else that the mod team deems disrespectful.

**We are not a debate sub**
    Uhh, Reddit mod, that was not to start a debate. That is absolutely ridiculous. That was a serious question, I don’t know where else to ask it. Only a trans person would be able to answer what I was asking.

Explain to me how my comment was a debate, please, I implore you. I was simply trying to better understand a group of people which I don’t have a lot of experience with… there’s no one in my immediate community I could ask this too, I was sincerely looking for an answer.

This makes me incredibly sad that a Reddit mod can decide to shut me down, really for no justification WHATSOEVER
Im not sure what about the game is transphobic. Ive been playing it for a few weeks now and dont really see what the fuss is about. Unless im just blind. Im trans but also very conservative so i may be bias
    Guilt by association really, JKR is a notorious TERF, and by buying and playing the game you are inadvertently supporting her and her viewpoint, I am continually saddened by trans people who are not aware of her and other popular figures who are engaged in transphobia or who claim to be able to ‘seperate the artist from the art’

Edited to say ‘inadvertently supporting’

    Its simple. Trans people asked allies to not buy the game in solidarity with them against a strong voice of anti trans activism. Many Allies decided that they could not give up a game to show their support for trans people. Thats the distilled simple way to look at it.
harry potter is my special interest, + i'm trans. i do not support jk rowling but i really love harry potter because it's like my little safe space i can go to
Good
Good choice! I really hate the controversy around that game, there’s been so much transphobia ever since that stupid game came out.
I am perfectly fine with people pirating it. I second this. 
 
Edit: Honestly I'm even feeling conflicted about people pirating it. It still spreads a property around that gets her more noteriety. Just avoid the damn game if you can please. 
 
Edit 2: I've been getting messages telling me to stfu and other various hateful things in regards to my views on this game. Reddit is refusing to address the messages saying no rules were broken when I report the nasty things people are messaging me. The PS5 sub has decided that silencing people against the game is better than removing posts about it. I even had a conversation with the mods there that basically told me if I want to leave the sub over it then that's fine. It's been an eye opening experience being pushed out of communities and such because a video game is more important to people than not supporting genocide.
    The plot of the game involves stopping a rebellion by goblins, which have been portrayed in media, but especially Harry Potter, to be gross caricatures of Jewish people. The game itself is trash.

Edited for clarity. Also it's not antisemitic to call something antisemitic, wherever that comment went.

    Really? I haven't used it in awhile so I wouldn't know anything. Are there any good alternatives?
Just a reminder that it's using Denuvo and it has not been cracked yet. 

There is literally only one cracker on earth (Empress) who has been able to crack Denuvo, and there are games that have been out for years that have not been cracked yet.
Yeah I’ve heard it’s not even that good
    Its good
    It's very good.
    Judging from people I know who are not into potter at all. The game is good enough to stand on its own legs pretty well. Most the people I know who have played it and said it’s not that good have put 120 hours into it. Sounds like sour grapes.

Not my kind of game in general.
what about viruses?
DISCLAIMER; I understand and respect everyone’s individual viewpoints on this subject (so long as they lack malice) and am not trying to claim that views or trauma responses are invalid.

Unless your actions have a clear and indisputable immediate negative effect on the trans and LGBTQ communities as a whole, I wouldn’t worry too much about how others perceive you. There’s a massive difference between simply buying this game while regularly supporting the trans community, and someone buying this game hoping that it will hurt the trans community (I have no hate for the former and no sympathy for the later). At the end of the day the only judgement that really matters is your own and those of people who know you in and out - someone who barely knows you has no right to make a sweeping conclusion about you and your morals based on something as superficial as what products you buy.

TLDR; So long as you actively support the trans community and fight against policies that try to harm non-cis / non-hetero individuals, I don’t think you have any reason to worry about public perception. Make the decision that is best for your own mental well being
    If you want to play a game but don't wish its creator well, just get an eye patch and a parrot and sail thr Seven Seas.
        My gripe is with the IP’s creator, not the creators of the game. Besides, the only people who will be negatively impacted by pirating are the non-contract developers. Too much collateral damage for my blood
            In this context you not buying the game is effectively the same thing as you pirating it, no money is made either way.
What I mean by this is, if you really want to play the game but not support JK (which I think is fair) just pirate it, you won't do any damage if you weren't planning to buy it either way. 

I personally am not even interested this game or Harry Potter in general and don't plan on playing it, so for me is an easy choice.
    Buying/playing Hogwarts Legacy has a negative effect on our communities as a whole though.

            …Harry Potter literally fuels that shit because JK Rowling got popular off of it. Every fucking transphobe listens to her on these things.
                The monstrous ways JK uses her billions of dollars, and the utter nonsense that she seems to spout on an almost hourly basis, is a different subject than the game itself. I’m arguing that the game itself is not inherently transphobic, and as a result will not have a perceivable impact on our community - especially when compared to the current issues we’re facing
                    She. Gets. Money. From. The Sales.
                        She's a billionaire. The Venn diagram of autistic people, with a special interest in Harry Potter, within the trans community isn't big enough to make a scratch let alone a dent. I get the mentality of not supporting her at all any very cent counts. But she's a literal billionaire. Them buying it has less of an impact than them not voting in a general election. 

If this game gives them some sense of comfort or joy then it's fine if they buy it. Maybe buy it used if possible but the world is a shitty enough place as it is. Let an authentic person enjoy their special interest without making them feel bad about it. 

To be clear. I'm not condoling everyone buying the game or supporting her at all. But think about scale for a second.
                        She also gets royalties from the amusement parks, Broadway show, merchandise, etc. so I don’t think the cut she would receive from WB in order for them to use the IP will be a massive increase to her current net worth (which is already in billions). It seems we’re talking about two different things here; my original point is that the game itself won’t have a perceivable impact on our community - not that JK will suddenly grow a conscience and use her sizeable net worth in a productive way
                            Are you aware of just how many people are going to buy this game? Gamers don’t give a shit about trans people.

Anyone who replies to this trying to be a devil’s advocate is wasting their time and proving my point.
                                >Gamers don’t give a shit about trans people.

that's a very generalized statement, considering that many trans people are gamers as well.

Also i hope you are aware that this entire "Buying HPL makes you support transphobia"-Thing is basically non-existent in the real world and pretty much only happening in the reddit/twitter bubble and some gaming websites no casual gamer on earth cares about
                                the thing is she already has billions of dollars so like will it really change anything if I buy it (i’m not just saying) like she’s already famous and like how is that fair to the people who worked on it who won’t be paid i doubt those people are transphobic or homophobic they just did their job and worked on a game and now they get no money that would suck
                                Gamer here that gives a shit about trans people
                            Here’s a thought maybe not purchase anything that benefits her
            Not a mutually exclusive.  Hurt can be additive.
            You really don't see how giving money to a woman who regularly slanders our community is harmful? You're full of shit. You're just self centered and playing a video game is more important to you than supporting your community.
        Would you say pirating it and playing it in the privacy of your own home does any harm? It wouldn't add to any financial gain for jkr and wouldn't add to the buzz of the game either.

            The game is antisemitic, pro slavery, and is apart of the IP of a woman who wants trans people dead, yes. I can’t tell you what to do but if you’re okay endorsing a game that involves you putting down a slave revolution to prevent an evil money hoarding goblin who does things similar to blood libel, that’s some interesting taste ya got there. Plus your trans and Jewish friends will see that even with all JKR’s hatred she spews, the people who led development on the game, and you actively consuming content that condemns both groups you are not a safe person to be around.
    very good take.
    I agree with your sentiment. Do purchases have a negative effect on the trans community? I suppose hypothetically, a small one. That being said...  


As I mentioned earlier, everyone out there in the world can't take on every battle for every cause. We take it a little personally because, well, it's personal. Also, we do have allies that chose this is the cause they are going to give time and effort to (thank you, by the way). However, out in the wild good people choose to champion other worthy causes... As long as they're good to us, we have to understand they can't know everything about everything all the time.  


And we have to respect their autonomy as well.  
On the other hand, those people who hate us and put concentrated effort against us, F them. F them right in the ear.
You can pirate it. In r/piratedgames on pinned megathread you'll find safe piracy sites. Use qbittorent and use a vpn if you live in a country, where pirating could get you in trouble and you'll be fine
    Thank you! That’s good advice, I really wasn’t sure how to pirate it so that was a perfect response 😀

    A lot of the problem people have with Harry Potter is that the ideology behind the world Rowling crafted can’t be separated from her own ideology. Her own bigotry (in the form of transphobia, racism, antisemitism, and so much more) are all rampant in the HP universe. Especially in the new game coming out, which promotes and attempts to justify squashing a slave rebellion.

That, and that she is one of the most active and prominent celebrities, especially in the UK, whose wealth is put towards lobbying against our rights. Not only does contributing to her wealth & IP increase her social capital and influence, but also the amount of money she is able to contribute to legislating away our rights.
        Not to mention one of the developers for the game has said transphobic things too. 

I’ve heard some say the Ravenclaw diadem looks like a reichsadler too given the context of the game
            > reichsadler 

Thing is the imagery of a bird in that position is not exclusive to germany.  
Half the europe has similar themes or similar structure(poland, russia, germany(still), spain until 1800s, france until 1700s, Romania, montenegro, USA and the list goes on and on) .  
Plus original reichsadler  not containing the swastika is dated nearly a century before.
        This is not a stretch
        [deleted]
            Lol shut up and go play your slave master simulator
    The games plot is essentially stoping goblins which are a Jewish allegory from getting civil rights. There really is no reason to play the game
    For me the point of contention is that Rowling donates to transphobic groups. If i buy the game then my money ends up in the pockets of people who want to make life harder for transpeople. Even if it is just a single cent i dont want to support transphobia. But i agree that it is your personal choice.
        Just put on an eye patch and a hook on one hand 🤭, that way the stupid #^**%# doesn’t see a penny.
            Hogwarts legacy has denuvo protection, it will take months, maybe years and possibly forever to pirate the game.
                Oh god! Even if there wasn’t a controversy around the game, that alone would definitely prevent me from buying it. Denuvo is such a crappy price of software, it creates more problems than it solves. Stopping rant here before I write a novel. Still, denuvo being the garbage it is, there’s a 50/50 chance the devs didn’t implement it correctly and we see a playable version in a few weeks. Or they implemented it correctly and it messes with the game….
    Because she profits off of your purchases.
    Because if you enjoyed the product and you pay for it you are benefiting and giving money to the Creator Give and they might

You guys were really helpful, thank you! It’s really tough when people are so… intense on the internet. It gets my anxiety up about things that other wise would be simple decisions :(
    I’m also Trans and autistic and plan to pirate the deluxe version, because (apparently) you can HELP the slave rebellion with the deluxe version! I also buy all HP merchandise off Etsy because then JKR isn’t profiting from it and instead genuine fans who disagree with her are! Thankfully, there’s a lot of ways to get around giving her money!
    Hey it's okay. Do you whatever feels right for you. Nothing wrong with either way as long as you don't actually agree with her.

Not everyone will attack you over it although a lot will. Toxic people happen. Knock em out verbally or physically.
        Thanks! I really don’t agree with her, she’s absolutely bonkers and I couldn’t fathom being that delusional. I don’t understand how people can agree with her, or people like her. It’s so crazy.

I try pretty hard to avoid toxicity, especially nowadays when people are constantly mean and out of pocket. It doesn’t make it any easier being autistic, it’s a pain 🫠
            She strikes me as very unstable. I've read her stuff...like what????

I'm trying too. Being trans doesn't automatically make you a good person sadly. But there's many awesone trans people out there. So try not to be too deterred. I've got into almost fights with some others like that... but I also have wonderful trans friends.

I'm also autistic. I was bullied and abused for years and just started fighting back one day. Sometimes you have to be prepared to go to the end and not back down. I admittedly take that to too much of an extreme. You're worth fighting for, and no one should get to treat you like that.
U can buy it, just be aware that you are contributing to trans genocide in doing so
You can buy the game on a steam key site or download it on steamunlocked if you dont want to support her and yeah you can like harry potter and be trans theres nothing wrong with that just dont support the author
    How do key sites have keys if the money isn’t going to the publishers/developers?

There are ways you can play the game without financially supporting JKR, such as buying it used, or playing it through... methods that do not involve spending money.
    This way you can enjoy the game without having your conscience upset at you financially supporting a transphobe. It is also worth noting that she will die a billionaire whether or not you as an individual buy it. So In the grand scheme whether or not you buy it wont make much of a difference on her bottom line
My thoughts on it are pretty much this, unless you're grabbing something special like a collector's edition, buy it used therefore no money is given to JKR.
I wouldn't worry too much about missing out on this game. Avalanche Software is not known for making good games, and tinfoil hat time I'm pretty sure they know the game sucks, so they're just trying to use the online notoriety to help sell the game as much as possible before release.

I'm like 99% sure when the game comes out people are just going to go "wow, this game really sucks" and no one outside of the transphobic preorder people are going to have it.

Instead of worrying about people who buy it or putting up notices warning people not to buy it, I truly think if everyone got together and agreed to just ignore the game and not discuss it at all, it would die out very quickly.
    The game actually is great. I know a lot of people were concerned about this before release though
Pirate it.
I mean... PirateBay? 

Wait until it is cracked and download it for free. 

Enjoy the content, but don't give this vile, prejudiced had a single cent.
Learn to pirate it. Pirating PC games is really easy now a days.
Wait a little while til second hand copies are available.

If you buy second hand, the money goes into the pocket of whatever game store you buy it from, and JKR won't see a penny. They literally buy cheap and sell higher, no hidden royalties to worry about.

It's a single-player story game. A lot of people will buy a physical copy, play it till they're sick of it, and then sell the game to buy another. You'll have no difficulty finding a copy if you're prepared to wait the few days post launch that it takes for gamers to clear it and sell their copy.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with loving the art and hating the views or actions of an artist. I enjoy listening to Michael Jackson's music, but the things he did make me sick. I enjoy watching Rick & Morty, but I hope Justin Roiland's cell mate knows he's in for domestic abuse (assuming he's convicted).

Obviously, it's not a clear-cut one, given that you're indirectly putting money in JKR's pocket by buying the game new. If you buy it second hand, there's no benefits to her though. The game sales are recorded by new sales, not pre-owned. Money goes to her on the initial sale only.
I sat with a trans autistic person in emotional distress over this very thing today, same experience with the stories as you. They felt the same way you do.

I didn’t give them any advice. Just talked about their feelings and reasons for an hour.

They’re going to play the game.
[removed]
if you wait a while, you could eventually buy it secondhand, that way it’s not money going directly to her? ;0; my wife ( who’s trans ) is also facing the same dilemma that you’re in
pIRACY...
Bit late but I also have this issue. I'm also autistic with HP being one of my special interests lately and while I want to play the game the prospect of giving money to JK is a bit saddening
🤓🤓🤓🤓
I didn’t read the 7th book when it came out because I didn’t really enjoy Halfblood Prince much in comparison to other things I was reading (year I discovered my fave book of all time, Catch22) and felt I’d grown out of it. Didn’t read it until about 10 years later just for nostalgic closure’s sake. HP is fine. It’s *fine* as a gateway drug into enjoying literature.

    Witches and wizards exist in a shit ton of fictional universes. But this level of cringe only in Harry Potter.
Fell asleep during the first book when I was 9. Really fucking boring tbh
Same, I read the whole series a while back and I just couldn’t get into it, it was so flawed. Everyone else I knew who read it liked it though so I figured I was just being nitpicky
It goes beyond JKR too. One of the original designers on the game was outed as a full tilt nazi (exposed via alt-right YouTube channel) and the game is about “””goblins””” stealing kids and taking over the world. It’s an anti-semitic propaganda 101 course.
Or when we ban them 🙃

        Are you here specifically to say that you bought it? If yes, then that's brigading and you'll be banned. If you're not here to specifically talk about that game and whether or not you bought it as well as the number of people here defending their purchase, then no.

We get a lot of trolls here that create new accounts specifically to say that they bought the game specifically so that they can get a reaction out of people for doing so.

We ban those people. They are trolls. We don't stan trolls here.
I'm non binary and have hp stuff. I also help low income trans people with name changes through a national non profit that strictly specializes in trans matters.

 I just dont want to give her the attention that she wants. My mom is like this. It ruled my life once and I have better things gs to do. I married a cis guy that's also not overly political. I'm not overly either. 

Do understand the other perspective of abstaining entirely. I have trans friends that abstain.  I don't agree with her but do my own thing.
    So you’re giving money to a person who’s ideals, speeches, and documents have led to real world harm for our community so she can take that money and put it towards lobbying to further erode our rights?

Not to mention the anti-semetic, pro slavery, pro authority undertones of the actual franchise. 

I get it.  Nostalgia is one hell of a drug.  But don’t pretend to not be contributing to the problems we’re experiencing.  My original comment applies to those within the community too.  If you’re going to contribute to our oppression, you are no ally to the community and you are no friend of mine.
        Actually I volunteer at a national organization that helps trans people fund their name changes. I've  done more than a lot of people, and I'm gonna keep going. 

I know some people view it as contributing.  I've nearly gotten into fist fights with really pushy people about that who wouldn't leave it be.

I know what I believe and I'm confident enough to keep going. I'm getting to do what I want with my life anyway and I'm happy with that.

Edit: I see those comments have been deleted. Makes sense.

Edit: No idea why people keep attacking me verbally.

Thank you to the nicer people, I appreciate you. 

I do not care what others think of me. I stopped a long time ago. Nothing anyone says will change my mind. I'm actually a lot happier now with me overall and my gender identity since I stopped caring and following groups because people say I should. There wasn't really any gender related peace for me until I did that.

I read what I read when I want. If someone wants to physically get in the way of that and touch me, they're getting beaten to a severe degree. Same with using the bathroom of my choice.

I prefer peace and try to handle things civilly. Always the best way. But if someone else forces it, okay. I've put that old violent part of my life from abuse behind me but I've sadly done it before and am always ready to do it again if I need to.
            You do you. I refuse to buy anything with JKR's name on it, but I cannot and don't expect everyone to do the same. People should be able to make their own choices without being judged on them, unless those choices actively hurt people. I find it highly unlikely JKR will get royalties from each game sold and she very likely already got her money, so who even cares. I boycott her out of principle, I don't pass judgement to those who don't.

Thank you for helping us.
            Great glad you do all that. Doesn’t change the fact your still financially supporting a woman who wants all trans people dead and has been sited in antitrans legislation. The books and movies are horribly bigoted anyway. Just because your trans doesn’t make you exempt from supporting a woman who wants us all dead

/r/gatekeeping
I don't get this at all. People can like media despite the creator or its origins. I don't think someone is a non ally because of one decision. It's about being holistic. I know gay people who eat at chicken filet a and allies who do to. This shouldn't be as big a deal as we are making it. Besides that jkr didn't make the game. There are still people who were hired to make a game and the money will go to them... not to jkr. Nothing we do will stop her from being a billionaire.
    People who are unwilling to sacrifice temporary gratification to stand with people harmed by that gratification do not deserve to be called allies.  Being an ally and being for equal rights means making sacrifices for the greater good.  Change doesn’t occur overnight.  It happens through dedication and sacrifice.  

The biggest inhibitors of positive change for minority groups are those who claim to be allies yet do nothing to help or worse, stand in the way.
        This isn't about something that actually changes trans rights if we even succeed in a boycott. It is just a single games sales. There is only so much political capital and instead of getting allies to lobby against trans legislation you are making them invest time and energy into a video game. This is at best, frankly, virtue signaling. You get to see who the "real" allies are but have barely done any good. 

Besides you make it sound like hl was attacking trans people. How? The game wasn't out when the boycott was decided so the contents aren't relevant. It's just that jkr is attached very indirectly? So what? If you are into left politics you mightve heard "there is no ethical consumption under capitalism". This is exactly what that refers to. Are you pro Sweat shops? No? Well you should never buy anything that is produced in China because they are definitely made in horrible working conditions. This kind of rhetoric doesn't help anyone. Individually you can decide to do it to be a better person. I'm vegetarian because I believe in animal rights, but I don't go telling everyone who eats chicken that they are supporting animal abuse. People still want to live their lives. There is no 100% ethical person in a first world country so don't get mad at people for not meeting an impossible goal.
            You say this as though I’m going out of my way to harass people.  I don’t care if other people play the game.  I personally consider it a betrayal and won’t associate with or support anyone who does play it.  If someone can’t be assed to make one little sacrifice to show support, I can’t be assed to call them an ally or even be around them.  

It’s my personal decision.  I don’t care what anyone else does.  But I absolutely do get to make my own judgement calls about who I consider to be “allies” and who I choose to associate with.  And people who’s idea of support is: “that’s cool that you’re hormones are being taken away and I totally feel for you but I’mma play my transphobic antisemetic blood libel game now” do not fit my definition of what constitutes an ally.
To your logic the trans people who play the game aren't proper allies too I assume. They also don't care about trans rights.
    They don’t care about trans rights as much as their own personal temporary gratification.  The same could be said of conservative(read: reactionary) trans people too.
Goblins are the bad ones. Do you know anything? They are horroble greedy creatures in the HP Universe
Self centered people and trolls I suspect.
There’s trans representation in the game, which is rare in the video game industry. Games like this actually help the conversation. The game doesn’t allow gender choices like male/female options on character creation. Why so much QQ over royalties?
Mix of self centered people and people with actual points.

As an example. I see the whole thing as a total win for rowing in my country. Japanese people are more or less unaware of the whole Rowling controversy and the first indication they are getting of it is people sending them death threats
And sexual assault threats over playing a game with no explanation.

This has literally set trans rights back a good 10 years in some areas were language Barrier is an issue.

    Congrats on rewarding antisemitism and transphobia.
        I think it's pretty antisemitic to look at fantasy goblins and say they remind you of Jewish people and stereotypes😭
My ideas exactly, thank you. It’s so unfortunate that I’ve heard some streamers are ending their streaming careers or “graduating” (if that’s the correct term for it) because of all the bullying.
I feel the same dude
    Not a very common opinion when I talk about it tho
Agreed.
Glad to know I’m not the only one who calls it “The Funny Wizard Game”
FWIW I do understand and it breaks my heart.  I don't think SHE even realizes it (this is NOT a defense of her), which honestly makes it even more dangerous - people who don't truly grasp the damage they are causing tend to cause way way more.

I don't personally face a lot of problems, socially.  I'm autistic but "high functioning" (ie: employable/exploitable :P ), I'm bi but that might as well be straight when you're white and cis most days.  I wish I was more femme (I'm cis, again, but I wish I could pull that femboy aesthetic.  Genetics did not help me there) but that's a personal thing.  So I can't really relate to what y'all face...  


...but I hope it means at least something when I say I try to be vocal and disruptive against people who want to hurt you and crave a more peaceful world for everyone.  I hate what is going on these days.  It's just so... dumb.
Isn’t that illegal? I’d just be afraid to get in trouble
That’s what I find so funny everyone is focused on the supporting J K Rowling bit but like why would I want to play a Harry Potter game where I’m the bad guy?

And theres lots of other stuff like that too. Alot of people are talking about boycotting the game specifically to hurt her wallet. I pointed out that boycotting the game because you dont want your money to go to a terf is perfectly fine, but it probably wont hurt her much financially. She actually gave away so much money to charities that she lost her billionaire status so money doenst seem to be her main drive anyways. Immediate ban. Theres no discussing anything with those people. Either you agree with their (mostly rabid) takes or youre banned. And while thats true for many subs what actually sets gcj apart is that even if you do agree with them, but not in the same rabid way that they do then youre also banned. Theres also some weird shit going on that if you speak against russia (in the russia-ukraine conflict) you can also get banned (i suppose because the sub hates the usa, so anyone anti usa automatically becomes the good side while they blatantly ignore that life for trans people in russia isnt great either). Its all really weird. If you want to save yourselve some beaincells dont go there.
Because money is going to someone who slanders our community. Please don't buy this game.

Not a bad idea, though I'd prefer they just disappear and not show up in our modmail to complain.
    Can you just ban people supporting this game? I think that would help clear this sub of some trolls posing as allys and stuff.
        We do.

We ban an absolute crap ton of people every day. I promise it's not just limited to people shouting the n word 50 times either, we're very strict about our sub being a safe space for people.
            I'm sorry if I came off as hostile towards you in any way I know the mods are doing their best. Thank you for what you do. I'm just frustrated seeing people supporting this game here of all places.
                Yeah, same here on the frustration part, and no worries, I didn't take that as hostile <3. I'd suggest reporting people who openly support it first, it allows automod or us to pick it up much faster than sending messages, but I figured out what you were talking about anyways.

<3
                    Sounds good. Thank you for what you do.
            You aren't even banning the people supporting this game in this thread.
                Please give me a break, I've been really busy lately <3
Whenever I come across controversies like this, I always try to steelman both sides. Issue I've found is that the best argument for buying it is 'well, everyone gives-in every once in a while', but that doesn't come close to justifying the purchase, even if piracy wasn't an option. It only justifies not excessively stigmatising people for buying it but, even then, you could just clap-back with 'just pirate it'. 

I think it's pretty hypocritical if I got all purist about it and pretend like my shit doesn't stink, because nobody is a paragon but, at the end of the day, it's still supporting a FART. 

Asking people to give-up mobile phones because of the slavery involved in producing them is quite an ask because of how mandatory they are to modern life, but this is a single video game. It's not even multiplayer. It's completely missable and nobody's lives would be much different and, again, it's piratable. Paying for it is just taking the worse of two options.

What does RTD stand for? O:
    Looking back, I completely left out the context that this was in a Doctor Who sub


Russell T Davies, the returning showrunner of Doctor Who, so yeah by saying they don't think trans rights are not that big of a deal, their attacking one of the shows new stars and the opinions of the person running their favourite show (and who is absolutely not shy about sharing his political views IRL or in his show)
        Oh shit, ty, I wasn’t sure if I was just dumb or if context would clear it up. 😂
Its simple. Trans people asked allies to not buy the game in solidarity with them against a strong voice of anti trans activism. Many Allies decided that they could not give up a game to show their support for trans people. Thats the distilled simple way to look at it.
I'm in a similar but different boat. I'm a trans woman, and my best friend, as well as roommate, is a queer, Jewish, cis woman who absolutely adores Harry Potter. Hell, when I met her, she had on a Harry Potter shirt and jean jacket, which did give me quite a bit of pause at first, but she was and is a delight, so I brushed off my apprehensions. Also, she knows how I feel about Joanne, and she feels the same way. But I have never known a better friend or ally in my life, and I don't want to take her happiness away from her. I did ask her, however, to pirate it rather than purchase it. One, because of the Joanne issue, which affects me, and two because of the anti-semitism inherent in the game that affects her. And she agreed to that, especially since she has some reservations herself. Anyway, I hope this helps.
If you don't mind dabbling in the dark arts there's certainly one option where you can have your cake and eat it too 🏴‍☠️your wife will have to be a bit patient though.
    Yeah, I straight up would have done that if we had a pc. Unfortunately I'm stuck on playstation and switch.
        Ah damn that does make it difficult :/ one idea if you can afford it is maybe donating the same amount to charities/organisations fighting for trans rights?
            That's a good idea. I'll see what local orgs I might be able to donate to
[removed]
Love you too 💜
she keeps jumping through some hella mental gymnastics to make herself not feel like a bad person for buying the game. and she constantly wants to talk to me about it but anytime she brings it up or mentions it i get really angery. i just want to enjoy being around my girlfreind again
This. ^^^^^ I mean I played the game because I personally thought it was kinda fun and after watching other people's playthroughs and sort of fell for Sebastian Swallow and Ominis's questline (I'm spoiling myself but after Cyberpunk, I prefer waiting before buying), I thought it was good enough to buy. Of course, other people will have qualms or reservations with playing the game and that's fine, too. 

It's been a month now and it looks like the drama has largely died down. Millions of people have bought and played the game and it seems like all that drama you were saying is nowadays confined mostly to the Vtuber Twitter space. Personally I'm not into Vtubers since I don't get their appeal, so Imma not try and dip my toes in something I'm not even a part of in the first place. 

It's a funny wizard game. Not everyone will like it. Play it, don't play it. It's been a month and personally, I think everyone's tired of talking about the drama now.
This whole thing has been a total disaster outside the English speaking world. Most Japanese people as an example are total unaware of any issue with Rowling whatsoever and the antisemetic part is largely lost on them, knowing basically nothing about that either.

So the first take they get on the whole thing is people sending them death threats and threats of sexual assault for playing a game with no deeper explanation to be seen.

This has literally set back trans rights and social views 5-10 years in Japan. And a total win for Rowling all around…
It's mainly towards JK Rowling, The creator of Harry Potter and the comments she has made over the years. Not saying there isn't some issues with the harry potter setting itself but most of the vitriol is linked towards JK.  She profits off of any media based of the Harry Potter IP. Though she does and will make more money off of other aspects off that brand than from HL solely.

Also if the game does not have the word trans as an option (south park managed it without issue in their games)  then no, we arent repped in character creation. They are using the same sliders that games used in the 90s and want to hope its a get out of jail free card from criticism of the IP owner.
I agree, and let me first say I am really not hoping for this, but I believe all of this drama will have some kinds of consequences towards the trans community like you said. I also feel like saying people that buy the game aren’t allies anymore would make those who actively support the trans feel like worse towards them, after supporting them for so long and just getting told they are doing the opposite for doing one thing that they enjoy. Not everything is done in malice.
Yall the whole concept of the game is killing a race of people heavily based off of jews?? Its a disgusting concept!
[removed]
cuz JK is transphobic
The issue is that 99% of these posts have been from cis people who have shown no interest in actually having a discussion about the topic. They come here either to

A. Seek validation from trans people that it's ok to buy the game and get in arguments when people disagree with them

B. Only to troll and pick fights with people. 

There are other more appropriate subs than r/trans for this type of discussion.
I've yet to see a single cis person coming to trans people "to have a dialogue" what I have had though is a lot of people arguing with me and belittling me. The game doesn't look that great in my opinion based on the trailers and my experience with other games and at best is a wait a see title not a day 1 purchase title. So even ignoring Rowling I still wouldn't be buying the game day 1. I still don't want to see daily posts about the game, especially from anti-trans trolls.
Honestly, it has some pretty horrible performance issues on PC currently. Console players are probably having a better experience.

It’s a game made by people who want our rights taken away. Fuck off.
She has donated a considerable sum to terf organizations.
r/TransyTalk is where I go for my vent posts
    I’ve never heard of that sub before I’ll take a look. Thanks. 💜
Respect the people who belong here. If you're confused what that means, here's a minor primer:

    No asking to date trans people or otherwise meet up with them.

    No treating being transgender as a mental illness or as being lesser in any way.

    No arguing with trans people about their identity.

    No arguing with trans people about their vulnerabilities, including anything related to sports, laws, etc.

And anything else that the mod team deems disrespectful.

**We are not a debate sub**
Uhh, Reddit mod, that was not to start a debate. That is absolutely ridiculous. That was a serious question, I don’t know where else to ask it. Only a trans person would be able to answer what I was asking.

Explain to me how my comment was a debate, please, I implore you. I was simply trying to better understand a group of people which I don’t have a lot of experience with… there’s no one in my immediate community I could ask this too, I was sincerely looking for an answer.

This makes me incredibly sad that a Reddit mod can decide to shut me down, really for no justification WHATSOEVER
Guilt by association really, JKR is a notorious TERF, and by buying and playing the game you are inadvertently supporting her and her viewpoint, I am continually saddened by trans people who are not aware of her and other popular figures who are engaged in transphobia or who claim to be able to ‘seperate the artist from the art’

Edited to say ‘inadvertently supporting’

The plot of the game involves stopping a rebellion by goblins, which have been portrayed in media, but especially Harry Potter, to be gross caricatures of Jewish people. The game itself is trash.

Edited for clarity. Also it's not antisemitic to call something antisemitic, wherever that comment went.

Really? I haven't used it in awhile so I wouldn't know anything. Are there any good alternatives?
Its good
It's very good.
Judging from people I know who are not into potter at all. The game is good enough to stand on its own legs pretty well. Most the people I know who have played it and said it’s not that good have put 120 hours into it. Sounds like sour grapes.

Not my kind of game in general.
If you want to play a game but don't wish its creator well, just get an eye patch and a parrot and sail thr Seven Seas.
    My gripe is with the IP’s creator, not the creators of the game. Besides, the only people who will be negatively impacted by pirating are the non-contract developers. Too much collateral damage for my blood
        In this context you not buying the game is effectively the same thing as you pirating it, no money is made either way.
What I mean by this is, if you really want to play the game but not support JK (which I think is fair) just pirate it, you won't do any damage if you weren't planning to buy it either way. 

I personally am not even interested this game or Harry Potter in general and don't plan on playing it, so for me is an easy choice.
Buying/playing Hogwarts Legacy has a negative effect on our communities as a whole though.
    [removed]
        …Harry Potter literally fuels that shit because JK Rowling got popular off of it. Every fucking transphobe listens to her on these things.
            The monstrous ways JK uses her billions of dollars, and the utter nonsense that she seems to spout on an almost hourly basis, is a different subject than the game itself. I’m arguing that the game itself is not inherently transphobic, and as a result will not have a perceivable impact on our community - especially when compared to the current issues we’re facing
                She. Gets. Money. From. The Sales.
                    She's a billionaire. The Venn diagram of autistic people, with a special interest in Harry Potter, within the trans community isn't big enough to make a scratch let alone a dent. I get the mentality of not supporting her at all any very cent counts. But she's a literal billionaire. Them buying it has less of an impact than them not voting in a general election. 

If this game gives them some sense of comfort or joy then it's fine if they buy it. Maybe buy it used if possible but the world is a shitty enough place as it is. Let an authentic person enjoy their special interest without making them feel bad about it. 

To be clear. I'm not condoling everyone buying the game or supporting her at all. But think about scale for a second.
                    She also gets royalties from the amusement parks, Broadway show, merchandise, etc. so I don’t think the cut she would receive from WB in order for them to use the IP will be a massive increase to her current net worth (which is already in billions). It seems we’re talking about two different things here; my original point is that the game itself won’t have a perceivable impact on our community - not that JK will suddenly grow a conscience and use her sizeable net worth in a productive way
                        Are you aware of just how many people are going to buy this game? Gamers don’t give a shit about trans people.

Anyone who replies to this trying to be a devil’s advocate is wasting their time and proving my point.
                            >Gamers don’t give a shit about trans people.

that's a very generalized statement, considering that many trans people are gamers as well.

Also i hope you are aware that this entire "Buying HPL makes you support transphobia"-Thing is basically non-existent in the real world and pretty much only happening in the reddit/twitter bubble and some gaming websites no casual gamer on earth cares about
                            the thing is she already has billions of dollars so like will it really change anything if I buy it (i’m not just saying) like she’s already famous and like how is that fair to the people who worked on it who won’t be paid i doubt those people are transphobic or homophobic they just did their job and worked on a game and now they get no money that would suck
                            Gamer here that gives a shit about trans people
                        Here’s a thought maybe not purchase anything that benefits her
        Not a mutually exclusive.  Hurt can be additive.
        You really don't see how giving money to a woman who regularly slanders our community is harmful? You're full of shit. You're just self centered and playing a video game is more important to you than supporting your community.
    Would you say pirating it and playing it in the privacy of your own home does any harm? It wouldn't add to any financial gain for jkr and wouldn't add to the buzz of the game either.

        The game is antisemitic, pro slavery, and is apart of the IP of a woman who wants trans people dead, yes. I can’t tell you what to do but if you’re okay endorsing a game that involves you putting down a slave revolution to prevent an evil money hoarding goblin who does things similar to blood libel, that’s some interesting taste ya got there. Plus your trans and Jewish friends will see that even with all JKR’s hatred she spews, the people who led development on the game, and you actively consuming content that condemns both groups you are not a safe person to be around.
very good take.
I agree with your sentiment. Do purchases have a negative effect on the trans community? I suppose hypothetically, a small one. That being said...  


As I mentioned earlier, everyone out there in the world can't take on every battle for every cause. We take it a little personally because, well, it's personal. Also, we do have allies that chose this is the cause they are going to give time and effort to (thank you, by the way). However, out in the wild good people choose to champion other worthy causes... As long as they're good to us, we have to understand they can't know everything about everything all the time.  


And we have to respect their autonomy as well.  
On the other hand, those people who hate us and put concentrated effort against us, F them. F them right in the ear.
Thank you! That’s good advice, I really wasn’t sure how to pirate it so that was a perfect response 😀

A lot of the problem people have with Harry Potter is that the ideology behind the world Rowling crafted can’t be separated from her own ideology. Her own bigotry (in the form of transphobia, racism, antisemitism, and so much more) are all rampant in the HP universe. Especially in the new game coming out, which promotes and attempts to justify squashing a slave rebellion.

That, and that she is one of the most active and prominent celebrities, especially in the UK, whose wealth is put towards lobbying against our rights. Not only does contributing to her wealth & IP increase her social capital and influence, but also the amount of money she is able to contribute to legislating away our rights.
    Not to mention one of the developers for the game has said transphobic things too. 

I’ve heard some say the Ravenclaw diadem looks like a reichsadler too given the context of the game
        > reichsadler 

Thing is the imagery of a bird in that position is not exclusive to germany.  
Half the europe has similar themes or similar structure(poland, russia, germany(still), spain until 1800s, france until 1700s, Romania, montenegro, USA and the list goes on and on) .  
Plus original reichsadler  not containing the swastika is dated nearly a century before.
    This is not a stretch
    [deleted]
        Lol shut up and go play your slave master simulator
The games plot is essentially stoping goblins which are a Jewish allegory from getting civil rights. There really is no reason to play the game
For me the point of contention is that Rowling donates to transphobic groups. If i buy the game then my money ends up in the pockets of people who want to make life harder for transpeople. Even if it is just a single cent i dont want to support transphobia. But i agree that it is your personal choice.
    Just put on an eye patch and a hook on one hand 🤭, that way the stupid #^**%# doesn’t see a penny.
        Hogwarts legacy has denuvo protection, it will take months, maybe years and possibly forever to pirate the game.
            Oh god! Even if there wasn’t a controversy around the game, that alone would definitely prevent me from buying it. Denuvo is such a crappy price of software, it creates more problems than it solves. Stopping rant here before I write a novel. Still, denuvo being the garbage it is, there’s a 50/50 chance the devs didn’t implement it correctly and we see a playable version in a few weeks. Or they implemented it correctly and it messes with the game….
Because she profits off of your purchases.
Because if you enjoyed the product and you pay for it you are benefiting and giving money to the Creator Give and they might

I’m also Trans and autistic and plan to pirate the deluxe version, because (apparently) you can HELP the slave rebellion with the deluxe version! I also buy all HP merchandise off Etsy because then JKR isn’t profiting from it and instead genuine fans who disagree with her are! Thankfully, there’s a lot of ways to get around giving her money!
Hey it's okay. Do you whatever feels right for you. Nothing wrong with either way as long as you don't actually agree with her.

Not everyone will attack you over it although a lot will. Toxic people happen. Knock em out verbally or physically.
    Thanks! I really don’t agree with her, she’s absolutely bonkers and I couldn’t fathom being that delusional. I don’t understand how people can agree with her, or people like her. It’s so crazy.

I try pretty hard to avoid toxicity, especially nowadays when people are constantly mean and out of pocket. It doesn’t make it any easier being autistic, it’s a pain 🫠
        She strikes me as very unstable. I've read her stuff...like what????

I'm trying too. Being trans doesn't automatically make you a good person sadly. But there's many awesone trans people out there. So try not to be too deterred. I've got into almost fights with some others like that... but I also have wonderful trans friends.

I'm also autistic. I was bullied and abused for years and just started fighting back one day. Sometimes you have to be prepared to go to the end and not back down. I admittedly take that to too much of an extreme. You're worth fighting for, and no one should get to treat you like that.
How do key sites have keys if the money isn’t going to the publishers/developers?

This way you can enjoy the game without having your conscience upset at you financially supporting a transphobe. It is also worth noting that she will die a billionaire whether or not you as an individual buy it. So In the grand scheme whether or not you buy it wont make much of a difference on her bottom line
The game actually is great. I know a lot of people were concerned about this before release though
Witches and wizards exist in a shit ton of fictional universes. But this level of cringe only in Harry Potter.
I like your energy friend!

    1. This was a joke, please don't take that 100% seriously. I mostly said it because there were _non-allies_ who were brigading the subreddit.
2. If you really would prefer different mods you are always welcome to find another subreddit or find a place that you think would be preferable.

    We ban trolls, just FYI.

    Are you here specifically to say that you bought it? If yes, then that's brigading and you'll be banned. If you're not here to specifically talk about that game and whether or not you bought it as well as the number of people here defending their purchase, then no.

We get a lot of trolls here that create new accounts specifically to say that they bought the game specifically so that they can get a reaction out of people for doing so.

We ban those people. They are trolls. We don't stan trolls here.
So you’re giving money to a person who’s ideals, speeches, and documents have led to real world harm for our community so she can take that money and put it towards lobbying to further erode our rights?

Not to mention the anti-semetic, pro slavery, pro authority undertones of the actual franchise. 

I get it.  Nostalgia is one hell of a drug.  But don’t pretend to not be contributing to the problems we’re experiencing.  My original comment applies to those within the community too.  If you’re going to contribute to our oppression, you are no ally to the community and you are no friend of mine.
    Actually I volunteer at a national organization that helps trans people fund their name changes. I've  done more than a lot of people, and I'm gonna keep going. 

I know some people view it as contributing.  I've nearly gotten into fist fights with really pushy people about that who wouldn't leave it be.

I know what I believe and I'm confident enough to keep going. I'm getting to do what I want with my life anyway and I'm happy with that.

Edit: I see those comments have been deleted. Makes sense.

Edit: No idea why people keep attacking me verbally.

Thank you to the nicer people, I appreciate you. 

I do not care what others think of me. I stopped a long time ago. Nothing anyone says will change my mind. I'm actually a lot happier now with me overall and my gender identity since I stopped caring and following groups because people say I should. There wasn't really any gender related peace for me until I did that.

I read what I read when I want. If someone wants to physically get in the way of that and touch me, they're getting beaten to a severe degree. Same with using the bathroom of my choice.

I prefer peace and try to handle things civilly. Always the best way. But if someone else forces it, okay. I've put that old violent part of my life from abuse behind me but I've sadly done it before and am always ready to do it again if I need to.
        You do you. I refuse to buy anything with JKR's name on it, but I cannot and don't expect everyone to do the same. People should be able to make their own choices without being judged on them, unless those choices actively hurt people. I find it highly unlikely JKR will get royalties from each game sold and she very likely already got her money, so who even cares. I boycott her out of principle, I don't pass judgement to those who don't.

Thank you for helping us.
        Great glad you do all that. Doesn’t change the fact your still financially supporting a woman who wants all trans people dead and has been sited in antitrans legislation. The books and movies are horribly bigoted anyway. Just because your trans doesn’t make you exempt from supporting a woman who wants us all dead
People who are unwilling to sacrifice temporary gratification to stand with people harmed by that gratification do not deserve to be called allies.  Being an ally and being for equal rights means making sacrifices for the greater good.  Change doesn’t occur overnight.  It happens through dedication and sacrifice.  

The biggest inhibitors of positive change for minority groups are those who claim to be allies yet do nothing to help or worse, stand in the way.
    This isn't about something that actually changes trans rights if we even succeed in a boycott. It is just a single games sales. There is only so much political capital and instead of getting allies to lobby against trans legislation you are making them invest time and energy into a video game. This is at best, frankly, virtue signaling. You get to see who the "real" allies are but have barely done any good. 

Besides you make it sound like hl was attacking trans people. How? The game wasn't out when the boycott was decided so the contents aren't relevant. It's just that jkr is attached very indirectly? So what? If you are into left politics you mightve heard "there is no ethical consumption under capitalism". This is exactly what that refers to. Are you pro Sweat shops? No? Well you should never buy anything that is produced in China because they are definitely made in horrible working conditions. This kind of rhetoric doesn't help anyone. Individually you can decide to do it to be a better person. I'm vegetarian because I believe in animal rights, but I don't go telling everyone who eats chicken that they are supporting animal abuse. People still want to live their lives. There is no 100% ethical person in a first world country so don't get mad at people for not meeting an impossible goal.
        You say this as though I’m going out of my way to harass people.  I don’t care if other people play the game.  I personally consider it a betrayal and won’t associate with or support anyone who does play it.  If someone can’t be assed to make one little sacrifice to show support, I can’t be assed to call them an ally or even be around them.  

It’s my personal decision.  I don’t care what anyone else does.  But I absolutely do get to make my own judgement calls about who I consider to be “allies” and who I choose to associate with.  And people who’s idea of support is: “that’s cool that you’re hormones are being taken away and I totally feel for you but I’mma play my transphobic antisemetic blood libel game now” do not fit my definition of what constitutes an ally.
They don’t care about trans rights as much as their own personal temporary gratification.  The same could be said of conservative(read: reactionary) trans people too.
Congrats on rewarding antisemitism and transphobia.
    I think it's pretty antisemitic to look at fantasy goblins and say they remind you of Jewish people and stereotypes😭

        I'm sorry if I came off as hostile towards you in any way I know the mods are doing their best. Thank you for what you do. I'm just frustrated seeing people supporting this game here of all places.
            Yeah, same here on the frustration part, and no worries, I didn't take that as hostile <3. I'd suggest reporting people who openly support it first, it allows automod or us to pick it up much faster than sending messages, but I figured out what you were talking about anyways.

<3
                Sounds good. Thank you for what you do.
        You aren't even banning the people supporting this game in this thread.
            Please give me a break, I've been really busy lately <3

Looking back, I completely left out the context that this was in a Doctor Who sub


Russell T Davies, the returning showrunner of Doctor Who, so yeah by saying they don't think trans rights are not that big of a deal, their attacking one of the shows new stars and the opinions of the person running their favourite show (and who is absolutely not shy about sharing his political views IRL or in his show)
    Oh shit, ty, I wasn’t sure if I was just dumb or if context would clear it up. 😂
Yeah, I straight up would have done that if we had a pc. Unfortunately I'm stuck on playstation and switch.
    Ah damn that does make it difficult :/ one idea if you can afford it is maybe donating the same amount to charities/organisations fighting for trans rights?
        That's a good idea. I'll see what local orgs I might be able to donate to
I’ve never heard of that sub before I’ll take a look. Thanks. 💜

My gripe is with the IP’s creator, not the creators of the game. Besides, the only people who will be negatively impacted by pirating are the non-contract developers. Too much collateral damage for my blood
    In this context you not buying the game is effectively the same thing as you pirating it, no money is made either way.
What I mean by this is, if you really want to play the game but not support JK (which I think is fair) just pirate it, you won't do any damage if you weren't planning to buy it either way. 

I personally am not even interested this game or Harry Potter in general and don't plan on playing it, so for me is an easy choice.

    …Harry Potter literally fuels that shit because JK Rowling got popular off of it. Every fucking transphobe listens to her on these things.
        The monstrous ways JK uses her billions of dollars, and the utter nonsense that she seems to spout on an almost hourly basis, is a different subject than the game itself. I’m arguing that the game itself is not inherently transphobic, and as a result will not have a perceivable impact on our community - especially when compared to the current issues we’re facing
            She. Gets. Money. From. The Sales.
                She's a billionaire. The Venn diagram of autistic people, with a special interest in Harry Potter, within the trans community isn't big enough to make a scratch let alone a dent. I get the mentality of not supporting her at all any very cent counts. But she's a literal billionaire. Them buying it has less of an impact than them not voting in a general election. 

If this game gives them some sense of comfort or joy then it's fine if they buy it. Maybe buy it used if possible but the world is a shitty enough place as it is. Let an authentic person enjoy their special interest without making them feel bad about it. 

To be clear. I'm not condoling everyone buying the game or supporting her at all. But think about scale for a second.
                She also gets royalties from the amusement parks, Broadway show, merchandise, etc. so I don’t think the cut she would receive from WB in order for them to use the IP will be a massive increase to her current net worth (which is already in billions). It seems we’re talking about two different things here; my original point is that the game itself won’t have a perceivable impact on our community - not that JK will suddenly grow a conscience and use her sizeable net worth in a productive way
                    Are you aware of just how many people are going to buy this game? Gamers don’t give a shit about trans people.

Anyone who replies to this trying to be a devil’s advocate is wasting their time and proving my point.
                        >Gamers don’t give a shit about trans people.

that's a very generalized statement, considering that many trans people are gamers as well.

Also i hope you are aware that this entire "Buying HPL makes you support transphobia"-Thing is basically non-existent in the real world and pretty much only happening in the reddit/twitter bubble and some gaming websites no casual gamer on earth cares about
                        the thing is she already has billions of dollars so like will it really change anything if I buy it (i’m not just saying) like she’s already famous and like how is that fair to the people who worked on it who won’t be paid i doubt those people are transphobic or homophobic they just did their job and worked on a game and now they get no money that would suck
                        Gamer here that gives a shit about trans people
                    Here’s a thought maybe not purchase anything that benefits her
    Not a mutually exclusive.  Hurt can be additive.
    You really don't see how giving money to a woman who regularly slanders our community is harmful? You're full of shit. You're just self centered and playing a video game is more important to you than supporting your community.
Would you say pirating it and playing it in the privacy of your own home does any harm? It wouldn't add to any financial gain for jkr and wouldn't add to the buzz of the game either.

    The game is antisemitic, pro slavery, and is apart of the IP of a woman who wants trans people dead, yes. I can’t tell you what to do but if you’re okay endorsing a game that involves you putting down a slave revolution to prevent an evil money hoarding goblin who does things similar to blood libel, that’s some interesting taste ya got there. Plus your trans and Jewish friends will see that even with all JKR’s hatred she spews, the people who led development on the game, and you actively consuming content that condemns both groups you are not a safe person to be around.
Not to mention one of the developers for the game has said transphobic things too. 

I’ve heard some say the Ravenclaw diadem looks like a reichsadler too given the context of the game
    > reichsadler 

Thing is the imagery of a bird in that position is not exclusive to germany.  
Half the europe has similar themes or similar structure(poland, russia, germany(still), spain until 1800s, france until 1700s, Romania, montenegro, USA and the list goes on and on) .  
Plus original reichsadler  not containing the swastika is dated nearly a century before.
This is not a stretch
[deleted]
    Lol shut up and go play your slave master simulator
Just put on an eye patch and a hook on one hand 🤭, that way the stupid #^**%# doesn’t see a penny.
    Hogwarts legacy has denuvo protection, it will take months, maybe years and possibly forever to pirate the game.
        Oh god! Even if there wasn’t a controversy around the game, that alone would definitely prevent me from buying it. Denuvo is such a crappy price of software, it creates more problems than it solves. Stopping rant here before I write a novel. Still, denuvo being the garbage it is, there’s a 50/50 chance the devs didn’t implement it correctly and we see a playable version in a few weeks. Or they implemented it correctly and it messes with the game….

Thanks! I really don’t agree with her, she’s absolutely bonkers and I couldn’t fathom being that delusional. I don’t understand how people can agree with her, or people like her. It’s so crazy.

I try pretty hard to avoid toxicity, especially nowadays when people are constantly mean and out of pocket. It doesn’t make it any easier being autistic, it’s a pain 🫠
    She strikes me as very unstable. I've read her stuff...like what????

I'm trying too. Being trans doesn't automatically make you a good person sadly. But there's many awesone trans people out there. So try not to be too deterred. I've got into almost fights with some others like that... but I also have wonderful trans friends.

I'm also autistic. I was bullied and abused for years and just started fighting back one day. Sometimes you have to be prepared to go to the end and not back down. I admittedly take that to too much of an extreme. You're worth fighting for, and no one should get to treat you like that.

1. This was a joke, please don't take that 100% seriously. I mostly said it because there were _non-allies_ who were brigading the subreddit.
2. If you really would prefer different mods you are always welcome to find another subreddit or find a place that you think would be preferable. Our goal always has been to protect the community, not just ban random people that we disagree with, and every effort we give is towards that goal, promise.

We ban trolls, just FYI.
Are you here specifically to say that you bought it? If yes, then that's brigading and you'll be banned. If you're not here to specifically talk about that game and whether or not you bought it as well as the number of people here defending their purchase, then no.

We get a lot of trolls here that create new accounts specifically to say that they bought the game specifically so that they can get a reaction out of people for doing so.

We ban those people. They are trolls. We don't stan trolls here.
Actually I volunteer at a national organization that helps trans people fund their name changes. I've  done more than a lot of people, and I'm gonna keep going. 

I know some people view it as contributing.  I've nearly gotten into fist fights with really pushy people about that who wouldn't leave it be.

I know what I believe and I'm confident enough to keep going. I'm getting to do what I want with my life anyway and I'm happy with that.

Edit: I see those comments have been deleted. Makes sense.

Edit: No idea why people keep attacking me verbally.

Thank you to the nicer people, I appreciate you. 

I do not care what others think of me. I stopped a long time ago. Nothing anyone says will change my mind. I'm actually a lot happier now with me overall and my gender identity since I stopped caring and following groups because people say I should. There wasn't really any gender related peace for me until I did that.

I read what I read when I want. If someone wants to physically get in the way of that and touch me, they're getting beaten to a severe degree. Same with using the bathroom of my choice.

I prefer peace and try to handle things civilly. Always the best way. But if someone else forces it, okay. I've put that old violent part of my life from abuse behind me but I've sadly done it before and am always ready to do it again if I need to.
    You do you. I refuse to buy anything with JKR's name on it, but I cannot and don't expect everyone to do the same. People should be able to make their own choices without being judged on them, unless those choices actively hurt people. I find it highly unlikely JKR will get royalties from each game sold and she very likely already got her money, so who even cares. I boycott her out of principle, I don't pass judgement to those who don't.

Thank you for helping us.
    Great glad you do all that. Doesn’t change the fact your still financially supporting a woman who wants all trans people dead and has been sited in antitrans legislation. The books and movies are horribly bigoted anyway. Just because your trans doesn’t make you exempt from supporting a woman who wants us all dead
This isn't about something that actually changes trans rights if we even succeed in a boycott. It is just a single games sales. There is only so much political capital and instead of getting allies to lobby against trans legislation you are making them invest time and energy into a video game. This is at best, frankly, virtue signaling. You get to see who the "real" allies are but have barely done any good. 

Besides you make it sound like hl was attacking trans people. How? The game wasn't out when the boycott was decided so the contents aren't relevant. It's just that jkr is attached very indirectly? So what? If you are into left politics you mightve heard "there is no ethical consumption under capitalism". This is exactly what that refers to. Are you pro Sweat shops? No? Well you should never buy anything that is produced in China because they are definitely made in horrible working conditions. This kind of rhetoric doesn't help anyone. Individually you can decide to do it to be a better person. I'm vegetarian because I believe in animal rights, but I don't go telling everyone who eats chicken that they are supporting animal abuse. People still want to live their lives. There is no 100% ethical person in a first world country so don't get mad at people for not meeting an impossible goal.
    You say this as though I’m going out of my way to harass people.  I don’t care if other people play the game.  I personally consider it a betrayal and won’t associate with or support anyone who does play it.  If someone can’t be assed to make one little sacrifice to show support, I can’t be assed to call them an ally or even be around them.  

It’s my personal decision.  I don’t care what anyone else does.  But I absolutely do get to make my own judgement calls about who I consider to be “allies” and who I choose to associate with.  And people who’s idea of support is: “that’s cool that you’re hormones are being taken away and I totally feel for you but I’mma play my transphobic antisemetic blood libel game now” do not fit my definition of what constitutes an ally.
I think it's pretty antisemitic to look at fantasy goblins and say they remind you of Jewish people and stereotypes😭

I get the mentality of not supporting her at all any very cent counts. But she's a literal billionaire. Them buying it has less of an impact than them not voting in a general election. 

If this game gives them some sense of comfort or joy then it's fine if they buy it. Maybe buy it used if possible but the world is a shitty enough place as it is. Let an authentic person enjoy their special interest without making them feel bad about it. 

To be clear. I'm not condoling everyone buying the game or supporting her at all. But think about scale for a second.
She also gets royalties from the amusement parks, Broadway show, merchandise, etc. so I don’t think the cut she would receive from WB in order for them to use the IP will be a massive increase to her current net worth (which is already in billions). It seems we’re talking about two different things here; my original point is that the game itself won’t have a perceivable impact on our community - not that JK will suddenly grow a conscience and use her sizeable net worth in a productive way
    Are you aware of just how many people are going to buy this game? Gamers don’t give a shit about trans people.

Anyone who replies to this trying to be a devil’s advocate is wasting their time and proving my point.
        >Gamers don’t give a shit about trans people.

that's a very generalized statement, considering that many trans people are gamers as well.

Also i hope you are aware that this entire "Buying HPL makes you support transphobia"-Thing is basically non-existent in the real world and pretty much only happening in the reddit/twitter bubble and some gaming websites no casual gamer on earth cares about
        the thing is she already has billions of dollars so like will it really change anything if I buy it (i’m not just saying) like she’s already famous and like how is that fair to the people who worked on it who won’t be paid i doubt those people are transphobic or homophobic they just did their job and worked on a game and now they get no money that would suck
        Gamer here that gives a shit about trans people
    Here’s a thought maybe not purchase anything that benefits her
