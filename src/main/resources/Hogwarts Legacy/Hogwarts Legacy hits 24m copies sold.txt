[[Hogwarts Legacy hits 24m copies sold]]





Atmosphere was 10 / 10

&#x200B;

was a bit too easy and had a really simple plot though but i enjoyed it
    one could say, it was a mediocre video game, but a great harry potter game.
        I am totally fine with that.
            Indeed

Harry Potter game I expected and was promised and Harry Potter game I did get. 

Cant say the same about other games of other famous IP's. People are still waiting for good Avengers or DC.

And this game being a bit "simple" makes it much easier for people who are not into gaming actually buying this game just because they want to experience the Wizarding world.

And if you ask me a sequel can ONLY improve on what they did here.
                Crazy to think that the best marvel videogame to date was made by the Lego team.
                    Yeah it is a great shame 

I did enjoy the Midnight Suns game. Customizing your hero and making your deck for them. It was also fun to have so many heroes working together and interacting.
                        I’m so disappointed that this game didn’t catch on 

It was far from perfect but I had a lot of fun playing it
                        im still waiting midnight sun -75 with all dlc
                        I hope they don't feel discouraged by sales. I'd love a midnight suns sequel.
                            I would like it as well.

With more customization options and maybe actual relationships with other heroes. And also more impactful choices because the dark and light didn't matter in my opinion when it comes to the story. Also more diverse missions and not just Hydra and those monster enemies.
                                My only gripe is I hate hate hated the character you play as. I’d rather play as one of the cool, interesting Marvel characters than generic hero B.
                                    I don't mind it. 

I just wish our choices could shape our hero better and have more range of customization when it comes to our abilities. 

Like, let's say Strange could show you how to cast some spells pushing you to be more magic-oriented. Or training with Cap and Carol to be more melee and physically oriented. 

That alone would make our hero better and more connected to the world.
                            An X-men game in this style could be absolutely amazing!
                    Huh... Spider-Man is a Marvel game?
                        Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man, yes.
                        Disney doesn't even make marvel games. They in fact disolved lucasarts games. 😮‍💨

We have sony and their insomniac to thank as well as Respawn for the Jedi games with Cal Kestis as the lead and even then they dropped the ball so hard on PC.
                        That’s more Sony then marvel though tbh
                            It is a still game within that fantasy world

It may not be a "Disney" game or an "MCU" game but it is absolutely a Marvel game
                            Also Marvel fans have had Marvel Vs Capcom 3 and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games.

The Deadpool game isn't groundbreaking, but it wasn't terrible.

The Guardians Telltale game was great fun

The Guardians of the Galaxy game was good quality also

And there are another 5 Marvel Games on the way
                    Guardians of the galaxy is a masterpiece. I usually dont like action games and I don't like Guardians, and I loved it.
                    Marvel's midnight suns, the guardians of the galaxy, insomniac's spider-man are all great. I rarely finish games but finished all of these.
                    Midnight Suns for me
                    This makes it sound like the lego devs don't just make excellent games in general. They've also made some of the best star wars games ever IMO. 

Also there's been some good spidey games over the years and GotG was good.
                        The only Star Wars games to ever top the LEGO ones are the old Kotor games and maybe the new Fallen Order/Survivor games (if you like Souls-esque gameplay that is). 

I enjoyed Rogue Squadron III quite a bit as a kid, but objectively speaking it was not that great of a game and I liked it as much as I did simply because the options available for Star Wars games were not great. There were also some niche successes in the MMO space, but neither Galaxies nor SWTOR really lasted all that long (yes, SWTOR technically still exists but not with any popularity really) in the grand scheme of things.
                    Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy..
                    I mean while we’re on the topic the best Harry Potter game was also made by Lego lol.
                Waiting for good DC? We forgetting the Arkham games?
                > And this game being a bit "simple" makes it much easier for people who are not into gaming actually buying this game just because they want to experience the Wizarding world.

This is the key that made the game so successful.

People did not buy this game for crazy and complex gameplay. They bought this game because they wanted to explore Hogwarts and the wizarding world that surrounds it. People wanted to play as a wizard and have fun checking out all the little details of a fantasy world they grew up reading.

Complex gameplay would make it harder to just pick up and wander to find all of the little pieces scattered throughout the game. It has exploration features galore though, which is exactly what this type of game (one meant for fans to explore an immersive world) needed.
                Exactly, me and my sister both bought this game, as we're both HP fans. Seeing as I play a lot of games, it was pretty easy, but I still really enjoyed it.


For my sister though it was perfect, as she mainly plays more laid back stuff like Animal Crossing.
                I’m playing this game alongside my daughter who has little gaming experience, and I think it’s just enough for her. It’s not too easy, but it’s challenging enough she might not beat a boss on her first try but try different strategies, and feel rewarded for her effort.
            I'd rather just a good game, I've played many games off the ips I like. Rarley have I played a good game off of IPS I like

This game was just boring. Never completed. Kinda the worst insult for a game. That I just didn't want to play
        It's beautifully crafted tho, The castle is really well done as well witht he environment.
        Considering there hadn’t been even a good Harry Potter game in years, the bar was low.

I do think it was a very good first attempt for this dev though considering their past games. 

I think mediocre is harsh. I’d say good. It’s on par with the worse assassin’s creed titles in terms open world collectathons with RPG elements and they’re solid games despite not being anything special.
        They put everything into the design of hogwarts, and everything else was an afterthought. Rewards are mediocre (which are just cosmetics), and room of requirement has way too many restrictions for a single-player game. 90% of side quests are just gathering random hidden things around the world. How the map edges are cut out, so you have to fly around it just to go straight.
            To the game's credit however, the combat is actually quite well done -- it's responsive and there is some element of strategic depth with the different types of spells as well as specific creatures counters. Combat was one of the most consistently enjoyable aspects of the game for myself.
                Agreed.  I really enjoyed the combat and thought the final Rookwood confrontation was a ton of fun
                Sucks you had to remove all your gear if you wanted to keep experiencing it and not one shot everything
                I thought the combat was pretty boring as well. For me it felt like it was mostly spectacle and little substance. The feeling of impact was missing and it became too much 'pew pew pew'.

It was probably good enough to carry a game in which encounters are rare, but considering the game is filled to the brim with combat situations, I was done with it around the five hour mark.
            I'm tired of "open world" games where there are the same things spread around the world.  Defeating some sort of "bad guy camp" 20 times gets old quick for me.  There is nothing unique about them.  Hogwarts, Spider-Man, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon, Infamous all have repetitive quests/areas like this.
                Yeah it's weird seeing people hate on this game, when a ton of other super well regarded games also have the same traits/issues.

I just finished Spiderman PS4 (well the PS5 version), and it is the definition of "basic-AF" open world game with collectibles and the same three or four side missions. But it's also a great Spiderman game that makes you feel like the webslinger so it's enjoyable.
                    At least Spider-Man has excellent well-designed main missions. Hogwarts put lots of obvious filler right into the main campaign.
                I agree, except Hogwarts Legacy went way beyond 20 of something.  There are 95 Merlin trials.  There are 9 types, but they are all similar enough.
            > They put everything into the design of hogwarts, and everything else was an afterthought.

That would be because first and foremost it was an exploration game. A way for people to adventure in the fantasy world they grew up reading, finding all the little things that were scattered throughout Hogwarts and the surrounding area.

It was not made to be an action title with complex and engaging combat, nor was it meant to be a dramatic epic with a cinematic storyline.
        Disappointed that there was no Quidditch.

I was a legend on HP Quidditch World Cup (PS2)
            Definitely, they even had good broom flight mechanics already in place! Even just as a minigame it would have been great fun, definitely more so than some of the other minigames they did implement. 

I, too, spent far too many hours playing HP Quidditch World Cup but on Gamecube instead for me.
                Granted, the game mechanics of Quidditch are so shit that it's understandable why they wouldn't want to bring it back to public eye.

For the unfamiliar reading this comment, Quidditch's scoring system is terrible.  Imagine you're playing hockey, where you have 1 Goalie, a few defenders and a few shooters, a total of 6 players on the ice at any given time.   They're scoring and defending and just playing a normal game of hockey.  Then, add a 7th player to the each team who is completely disinterested with scoring or defending, who is off doing some difficult solo task.  The game is over when one of the team's 7th players completes their solo task.  The other 12 players scoring and defending only actually matter in the outcome in the game if one team scores 15 goals more than the other team.  

So for 90+% of games, what 12/14 players are doing makes absolutely no difference on the outcome of the game.

If Quidditch were to ever be put in a game again, I would recommend they just remove the Seeker/Golden Snitch component altogether and declare the game over after 1 hour.
                    > If Quidditch were to ever be put in a game again, I would recommend they just remove the Seeker/Golden Snitch component altogether and declare the game over after 1 hour.

I think the real problem, more than the snitch, is the fact that people act like goals would be hard to score in Quidditch.

You're flying around at easily 60+ mph on brooms throwing a ball into one of 3 MASSIVE hoops, with 3 different dimensions of travel you can use to evade defenders and no restrictions on the use of your hands to control the game ball. In the books and movies they seem to describe scoring as if it were akin to soccer or hockey, with high-scoring affairs being rare. In reality it would be MUCH more similar to scoring in the NBA with each teams scoring multiple times every minute of gameplay. 

Anybody who thinks goals with a Quaffle would be any less frequent than field goals or 3-pointers in basketball is absolutely delusional.

That introduces the other problem though, which is that because scoring would be so frequent it begins to trivialize the snitch unless you can find it early enough in the game before the better combination of beaters and chasers have started to snowball their advantage. In reality the keepers would have a rather minimal effect on the game because you could just force the keeper to commit to defending one hoop and throw it instead into either of the other two hoops that was left completely open.
                        That's true.  With how valuable the Snitch is, I wonder if teams would create 2-Seeker lineups, or maybe just abandon it altogether and play 0-Seeker lineups.
                            I feel like a real-life quidditch would essentially just pull the keeper 100% of the time because a keeper would have little chance at actually stopping shots on goal for the reasons I outlined above. At best the keeper would play more like a defensive back in soccer, trying to quickly steal the ball from attacking chasers before they got to the goals and shuttle it back to their own offense.

As far as the seeker goes, that's a tough one. If you had good beaters and chasers then I would think you'd prioritize pulling the seeker as well to maximize your advantage when it comes to scoring the Quaffle as many times as possible. If your beaters and chasers were worse than the opponent's, however, then finding the snitch fast would be your top priority since it would be the only real chance for you to win.
                                Come to think of it, you have  people flying on brooms at 60 mph.  Once one team has the Quaffle, how easy would it be for them to keep it for themselves the whole game.  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.  Aren't they allowed to fly through a hoop instead of throwing it for easy points?
                                    >  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.

The magical person-seeking missiles that are bludgers flying faster than you can go on a broom would be the main thing stopping that from happening. If you tried you just eventually get merced by a bowling ball which forces you to drop it.

It seems that after each goal is scored you have some kind of toss-up of the ball in the middle of the field to restart play, same as a face-off in hockey. Thus it doesn't really matter if you throw the ball or carry it through the hoop since you go back to the center face-off anyways once the goal has scored.
        Agreed to this. I'm enjoying the game at the moment but the world just feels a bit bland for me.

Enjoying how simple the game is but also I wish this game was Skyrimed abit. 

Nothing complex but damn I just want the world to react to me. I'm using unforgiveable curses left and right and yet people DGAF. 

NPC's should be killable. Deduct points to my house if I do shenanigans... don't bring me to a game over screen... wth. There should be real repercussions to what I do etc....

And just like Skyrim... allow me to pay off my sins (in the case... allow me to memory wipe witnesses like Lockhart)

Older games have done this but somehow this game is opting for the safe path.
            >NPC's should be killable. Deduct points to my house if I do shenanigans... don't bring me to a game over screen... wth. There should be real repercussions to what I do etc....

The end of year speech from Dumbledore or whoever would have been interesting... 

"And for the massacre of 5 patrons of the Hogs Head in Hogsmead, I am deducting Gryffindor 12 points."
                LMAO. Or just get a full wanted rating and have an army of aurors descend on you.
                    Would be pretty sick if every game was similar to GTA. Harry Potter GTA? Pokémon GTA? Marvel and DC GTA? Dragon ball Z and Naruto GTA? GTA GTA? Lol
                        Dragonball Z GTA. Who’s gonna stop Goku’s rampage? What army?
                            Your protagonist is Yamcha
                                Ahh so like a cabbage, got it.
                            All the Kai’s come and jump you along with whiz and beerus
            No one is making a game where you can murder a bunch of 11 year olds….
                r/prequelmemes: Hello there
                I mean Skyrim also didnt allow the murder of kids. Not saying you can kill Hogwart students but adult  non essential NPCs should be killable. 

I just want to Skyrimfy the shit out of this game.
                    The world or hogwarts isn’t about just randomly killing people, that would add nothing to me.  
I don’t even think those unforgivable curses should even have been in the game, and certainly not with how casually they are treated.    

There are plenty of other was to make the world more reactive without turning a teenager in to a killer.
                        > I don’t even think those unforgivable curses should even have been in the game, and certainly not with how casually they are treated.

I'd have been happier with the inclusion of unforgiveable curses if they came with consequences.

In the books and movies the ministry of magic can track every single spell ever cast by an underage wizard. They know full-well that some kid is going around Avada Kedavra-ing a bunch of trolls and goblins, but seemingly nobody cares about it.

Some sort of reputation system would have been a nice touch at least, with interactions with "good" characters becoming more negative the more you used unforgiveable curses and interactions with "evil" characters becoming more favorable and vice versa.
                        I mean... my game of reference isn't also about randomly killing people as well. 

What I generally mean is NPC's should be part of the world and not just a pretty walking vase. 

For example, if I go unlock a house, the NPC inside shouldnt just be randomly sipping tea while I ransack their chest... either pummel me unconscious or run away and report me to school. 

If I throw an exploding spell recklessly... that random npc person should be accidentally blown to bits... 

Again not fully go Voldemort but just live in a reactive world. NPC's in this game right now are nothing but pretty decorations.

My initial example was too out there... but I think you know what I mean. We both want the same thing... just a living reactive world.
                            Can you stop calling it skyrimify as if skyrim was anything more than your first example of a game like that rather than the creator or pinnacle of the type of game lol
                                Not everyone is going to have the same reference points for a given trope in media. Don't be so elitist.
            I mean, I get your criticisms, but “I should be able to slaughter people in my Harry Potter game and bribe the prefects if I get in trouble” is actually an insane take.

I would be happy with the world reacting to me more, and some increased difficulty.
                Also, could you imagine anything more stupid than being caught murdering students and then getting points deducted from your house instead of going straight to Azkaban.
            I think it was as complex as I want it to be... with the crafting, upgrading gear plus the rock-paper-scissors spell system that isn't just about damage/resist type but actually integrates physics and visuals (e.g. pulling them into range, then blasting them with short range spell). 

Not sure what gamers think is "top notch" here; does it need to have like 8 systems of inter-relating special items, special moves, special-er moves, gear/weapon art moves, pet/summon moves, co-op moves, environmentally-based moves, etc., to be happy with a third person action-adventure game?
                Complexity is often the enemy of fun. Some is good, but too many systems causes confusion. Better to have a few well-understood systems, with plenty of choices within those systems (e.g. different spells or different gear), rather than doubling the number of systems that players need to understand.
            Would be great to have the same level of modding tools, that way the community could step in and fill the gaps. Because the team made it pretty clear that they aren’t doing any DLC or additional content.
                There’s some sort of update/announcement coming soon per a recent tweet so maybe they will end up changing their mind on DLC given the game’s success.

                It's an unreal game. So you can just make blueprint plugins in UE and throw them in the game.
        100%. They had a very very high bar to try and meet, and they did a great job. The dialogue did feel like ChatGPT most times, but I was able to get over that and just enjoy it.
            Yea, if the dialog was better and the open world exploration had more unique and challenging content (way too many repeating merlin trials and caves), it would be a great game.
        "It was a mediocre video game".

Ever wonder if we've set the bar too high?

Seriously. Every post about any popular game on here seems to expect every game to be the second coming of Christ in order to hit par. 

The world needs "good" just as much as it needs "outstanding".
            "Ever wonder if we've set the bar too high?"

First i would say, the only way the bar knows is up.

But in regards to HL the Story and dialog is just that: mediocre, that's not a bar set too high.
            Id argue it was so successful because everyone set the bar so low for this one.


If it was a new IP with no association to Harry Potter it would of been forgotten within a month as another generic open world game.
            Curious to know if you've played the game? Because idk how you could (without nostalgia goggles) say it was better than mediocre.
                I have played the game. I enjoyed it a lot, even as a non-fan of Harry Potter. I played it, completed it, and moved on.

The game has beautiful visuals and the gameplay was familiar and done well. The story left a little to be desired, but story is oftentimes the hardest part to excel at. 

It's clear that they put a lot more effort into the visuals and the verisimilitude of the game world than they did the story and RPG mechanics, but in no way did I feel like and of its pitfalls made the game any less than "good".
        I was never really into the Harry Potter movies, but I really enjoyed the game!
        I think they accomplished their goal, For a first play through it’s incredibly immersive and satisfies the fantasy of attending hogwarts/ exploring the movie sets
        I was getting downvoted for this an opinion all last year. If you look at just as a video game, it’s probably a 6/10 game. 

They did good job on Hogwarts.
            In today's gaming world, 6/10 tends to be given to subpar games (weirdly). I don't think this game is *that* bad. It's more of a "pretty good" not "good/great" game.

It looks great, plays well, and executes it's mechanics very well. It just isn't deep, unfortunately.
                On a scale that is used properly, 6/10 is accurate. On the scale that video game reviewers use, 6/10 basically means "completely unplayable trash", in that case, not an accurate description of HL.
                Yeah I think the main issue I had with it was the over hypedness of it. Lack RPG elements and any elements they did add, were basic.

The whole bottom portion of the map didn’t need to exist from a story perspective. Feels a lot like they took on more than they could handle.

Edit: personally don’t know if I want to replay it and I’m a big HP fan. A game like cyberpunk thought, I’m itching for a second play through.
            Yea, that's mob mentality + honey moon phase for you
            Not in a world where Spider-Man 2 gets GotY noms it isn't. If you want to say SM2 is also a 6/10, I'll agree. But as far as 3rd person open world adventure games goes HL was miles ahead of it.
        Like DBZ Kakarot
        That's exactly what it was. 
        In a world where executing a "mediocre" video game is too hard for some mega franchises this was an absolute master class on give the fans what they want and it will sell.
        >one could say, it was a mediocre video game, but a great harry potter game.

So the same as all Harry Potter media.
        Really? I think it might go the other way. The expectations for a AAA HP game are way higher than they would be for a similar game that wasn't a massive media franchise license.   


While uneven mechanically and yes it is 15% Ubisoft bullshit.. there is also the graphics, sound, voice talent, characters and story (even separate from the HP-ness).. relatively seamless transition of flying/walking, respectable crafting and upgrade system.. amazing level of character customization.

Overall it's at least 8/10 purely on its technical merits. I think we call it mediocre \*because\* it is Harry Potter and "how dare it not blow us away in every respect. "
        It could be, but it's not.
I can't say that game good, if there is no good gameplay, or storyline and characters, or something innovative.
        I just thought mediocre all around.


For a game called Hogwarts Legacy they really love making you spend most your time outside of Hogwarts.
    10/10 Hogwarts exploration sim. 

4/10 everything else. 

7/10 overall, in my opinion.
    More specifically, the atmosphere of Hogwarts itself was a 12/10 

the surrounding area was maybe a 7 or 8, but damn the school had so much detail and felt so alive
        I spent the first 6 hours of the game just exploring Hogwarts. Not doing quests, not trying to collect things, just absolutely mesmerized that I am finally inside a fully-realized school that I've dreamed of since I was a little kid. It sounds insane, or at least very fanboyish, but I shed a few tears during my exploration, simply because of how gorgeously detailed the entire castle was.
        They should have just put more details and quests into Hogwarts itself instead of trying to add on a generic open world area

Also the many unlockable outfits feel out of place (school dress codes are normally strict) and many quests that require killing was kind of lazily copying other open world RPGs where you grind enemies too
    I was told the game was bad, came to check reddit, encountered the most toxic subreddit r/gamingcirclejerk..  made me play the game
        That sub was occasionally fun until they absolutely lost their shit over this particular game and couldn't stop mention it in 99% of their posts for months.
            They where couped by tankies in April 2022 after the tankie mod removed the other mods beacuse the former mods made fun of the tankie's trying to mint NFT coins.
                what are tankies? 
        I got permanently banned for making a single comment in a discussion thread about the state of the sub at the time - "This sub has become a parody of itself".

Apparently, I've since been unbanned so I guess someone somewhere came to their senses.
        The game is fucking great.
        That place has become such a toxic shithole and it spread pretty quickly to other subreddits. Most normal people would agree that liking the HP brand itself doesn't make you a JK Rowling-supporting transphobe (I would assume most fans  in general aren't chronically online weridos who know or care about every single moral crusade going on), but boy did a lot of people on that sub act like it did! I gave up trying to engage because they all wanted to practice extreme essentialism and I was just tired of it.

I'm going to predict the paragraph above might get me some angry replies that will automatically assume that I'm one of those "JK Rowling-supporting transphobes" because they lack nuance and reading comprehension.
    and that was the case with the source material. Atmosphere and world building made HP great, maybe also some characters, while story was just there to keep it going.

Game is the same, maybe lacking in characters this time. I can’t complain though, enjoyed it a lot for the same reasons I enjoyed HP before.

            For what I've seen form him i assume the man struggles to get out of his own t shit on account of being lost and Ignoring light showing him the way out of spite.
                I highly doubt he ever changes his clothes, let alone takes showers. He’s a WoW player after all
                    Yo, don't throw us all in the same category, I play WoW and I've changed my shirt, like, twice this month.
                        Okay, but the real question is how many times did you shower last year?
                            At least 5.
        Man rebound S true WoW player
    I think the combat stands out too, the spell casting felt really smooth to me
    Yeah, it did it well. Repetitive and simple but idk was worth the money I spent and had fun

Just upset there was some bugs that prevented me from a platinum but I had my fun with it
    If it wasn't Harry Potter themed it would be a sub-par RPG
    Still kinda mad they didn’t add a NG+. Could’ve done some really fun stuff with the O.W.L’s influencing the next play through
    > was a bit too easy 

Because, like the books, it needs to be accessible for an 8 year old.
    Yeah hit the nail on the head for a hogwarts game, but I grew bored with it because of the combination of easy combat(even on hardest difficulty) and uninspired  story.
    Yeah, it's a really atmospheric game.
For me, personally, it's become a problem, because of that it was already to late, when I realized that no any other good features presented in Hogwarts, and I lost moment to make a refund.
    Yeah, I kind of wish it had different difficulty settings. I'm not someone who chooses to play games on hard by any means, but still was too easy. I get it's made so non-gamers and younger kids enjoy it, as I'd guess they are the main target audience, it's also the reason why they (I think) chose a simpler storyline and sidequests. 

Still, a harder difficulty so you have to optimize your spells and perhaps having to level up certain spells or other mechanics would've made it more interesting. As you said, the game was still enjoyable and I don't regret it at all, and my girlfriend who is a Harry Potter fan enjoyed watching me play it as well.
Honestly they need to make a HP game with a Persona 5 style storytelling system, where you actually go through a whole year.
    So you want to be a student who bangs their teacher?
        Of course, have you seen Hagrid?
            Now imagine Hagrid as a sexy maid
                We all can access AI generated images, remember..
                    But then Hagrid has 6 toes in my face.
                        Is that a problem?
        YES PLEASE

ahh... professor garlick...
        I'm sorry, but I have done enough research on Professor Garlick to be okay with this.
        So Fire Emblem Three houses?
        \*Acid Jazz Intensifies\*
        Professor sprout can get it
    Honestly I would've been much happier for it being just school sim instead of creating this generic "chosen one" story. The game was good but I still would like to just have Harry Potter RPG where you can just go to school, choose your own classes, maybe join quidditch team, explore the castle and grounds, develop relationships with other students etc.

As Potter fan, I am happy what they gave us. But I really hope that one day we get more school focused game where you can just be part of the world as normal student.
    Been always saying this. HP would work perfectly in that style. Shame i doubt it will happen though. I liked Hogwarts Legacy but for the most part honestly never really felt like I was a an actual student at hogwarts. Going through every day of the year would be awesome alongside a couple of dungeon/palace type missions.
        Wasn’t there an old sorcerers stone PS1 game that had a lot of this?
        Wasn’t there an old sorcerers stone PS1 game that had a lot of this?
    Or bully. But I wanted to actually feel like a student to where my classes, attendance and such are also game mechanics that are possible to fail. 


Shit the opening to the original fable game captures the feeling of growing up in a magic academy better.
    I just want a Harry Potter game that doesnt have some weird world ending doom plot shoehorned in. It doesnt need it
    dude just straight up give me a turn-based jrpg harry potter game and i think i would pay 200 dollars and my left leg for it
        There was one for Game boy advance! Bit dated of course but I remember having fun with it
            I'm pretty sure it was for the GameBoy Color, and there were two. I also remember having fun with them! There was a lot of disappointment when I found that the GBA games weren't the same style.
    It takes talent and vision to make a persona game. ;)
Exploring the universe that I grew up watching , reading about and loving was the biggest point of me liking the game
    The triumph of the game was Hogwarts itself. Actual story was a bit meh but as a concept it was phenomenal. A sequel that utilises the castle again but maybe puts more emphasis on the student experience at Hogwarts instead of another "chosen one" narrative will be incredible. So much potential here
        This is basically it. The world is what everyone loves about Harry Potter. The actual stories told within that world and the systems underlying it have always been decent at best but the world itself? That we wanted more of.
            I think the Harry Potter story was very good. Maybe I just love then so much cause I grew up reading and watching them I watched them everytime they aired on TV and in the game walking the halls with RTX On was just an nostalgic expirence the game's story could have been a  better I agree. The world of Harry Potter always makes you wanting more of it
                >The world of Harry Potter always makes you wanting more of it

The first Fantastic Beasts movie hit this itch super hard. At least where he's in his little zoo.
                    Yesss seeing all the magical beasts makes you just fall in love with the world. And whenever just in a trailer while browsing a streaming service you hear the main theme and you instantly want to start watching that movie.
        Yeah i didn't care for the story at all but exploring the castle was 100% worth it. Usually i don't care about collectables but i had so much fun exploring hogwarts that i collected everything it had to offer.
        Combat was solid, too. The way spells could combo together was super fluid and clever.
        I really wanted DLC, I want to keep the spells I learned and all the outfits I unlocked.  I am not sure I will pay to start fresh again, unless it’s a different character altogether.
        Bully and witcher 2 are games they should take from. Bully with its student experience and NPC interaction and wicther 2 for its branching  main story.
    Pretty much.....it's like Skyrim in HP world
Crazy how huge Harry Potter still is. 

Also crazy how disconnected the "gaming community" (Reddit, twitter, etc.) is from actual sales figures.
    There really isn’t a “gaming community” any more than there is a “TV watching community.” It’s not a niche hobby anymore and the people online are just a tiny fraction of the user base.
    Reddit is disconnected from reality in pretty much every facet. The majority opinion on Reddit is rarely a reflection of the majority of people IRL.
        The boycott people are usually pretty loud. While the people who don’t care…. Usually don’t care and will just move on and buy what they enjoy
            we can also extend this to....people who are upset are very vocal

people who don't care won't participate

twitter and reddit seem like they're always upset with everything because of this.

like even if I have a contrary opinion and I see a community of people all malding, I'm gonna scroll on by without commenting because I'd rather not get a bunch of reddit cares and angry DMs
        This makes sense because Reddit consists of the hardcore player base of a game, whereas most players are casuals. Hardcore players and casual players care about different things.
            The best way to stop enjoying a game is to be on the Reddit for it. If you were enjoying it you'll get brainwashed in the negativity and change your mind or just feel bad for enjoying it.

Current path of exile Reddit is slowly turning into a nice place once you've finished the mandatory 1-2 weeks of a league launch where everyone is beta testing the league for them.
                >The best way to stop enjoying a game is to be on the Reddit for it. 

I enjoy browsing r/SatisfactoryGame.

It seems like the more niche the game, the more wholesome the community is. Purely anecdotal since idk about the other communities i don't take part in.
                    This is always true in my experience. I blame the fact that popularity brings kids into communities but it could be just cope for people being people
                    The same is true for DRG. one of the best gaming communities. ROCK AND STONE!
                    Same with factorio.. no time to argue when THE FACTORY MUST GROW!!!
                    This really does depend. The battle brothers subreddit is really good if you want end game advice. It's fucking trash if you're starting out because every other post is "trash bro, dump him, you'll never do the end game locations that are only meant for the hardcore players with that bro". 

Which is funny in itself because there are people who have cleared that location with average bro's.
                I mean I'm on subreddits for games I love the community is very harsh of and it's never once made me dislike a game. I enjoy playing the game. Everything outside of me enjoying the game has no impact on my enjoyment. And if I don't enjoy the game then no matter how much people sing it's praises I won't play it since I don't enjoy it. Basically just play like you what even if everyone you see and hear is saying it's trash. I'll enjoy living in my dump then.
                    Yep. Other people don’t change my enjoyment.
                The rimworld sub is surprisingly wholesome considering what the game is
                Depends on the game. Joining r/warthunder brought me peace knowing I'm not the only one being dragged through the mud every day
                It also removes the enjoyment of figuring out a game for yourself. Take Palworld as an example, its way more fun to run around aimlessly and feel the surprise/excitement of stumbling across a rare pal or a new boss or something rather than reddit telling me which dudes are worth leveling/where to get them and which dudes should stay in the palbox.

            > This makes sense because Reddit consists of the hardcore player base of a game

It's even more disconnected than that.

Reddit usually consists of a subgroup. Yes, more 'hardcore' players, but still not a general reflection of the 'hardcore' playerbase, they're a mix of 'hardcore', 'nerds', primarily pc players rather than console, and permanently online. 

It's a niche inside a niche. (Like almost everywhere on the internet)
            The other thing to consider is that, of the "hardcore" players, like in all aspects of life, most are just chilling and not commenting positive/negatively. The vocal minority is a sliver *of a sliver.*
            I don't think this is a correct assumption. At best you can say that the reddit portion of a games population is the population that uses reddit.
                Don’t care
            Reddit also thought it was unfathomable let alone impossible for somebody like Trump to win presidency, but here we are. I never liked Trump and never voted for him, but I constantly got called a Trump supporter because I told people to vote and be wary of him.

I promise you those same idiots will still tell me I’m wrong and downvote me here too. Mostly because they still exist here and are still disillusioned.
        Spider-Man 2 is a good example of this. 90 metacritic, 9.0 user score, 9.3 imdb, 90 opencritic, 97% recommend. The game has sold/is selling amazing even going as far as to break a record for PlayStation yet somehow the majority opinion on Reddit is that it's an objectively bad game and a terrible disappointment.
        Some people have ample community in their lives, some don’t. Some who don’t seek community online. Those that don’t have ample community tend to get their opinions on world event from mass media which usually has a particular way of looking at things. Harry Potter = bad now being one of those opinions.
    Go to Universal Studios (any of them across the globe) and visit the Harry Potter park. It will always be packed full, no matter when you visit.
    It shows up with Call of Duty every single year. Reddit convinces themselves this is it, this is the failure...and it tops the sales charts.

Honestly I think it's happening again with Suicide Squad. The narrative on social media platforms is a lot different than on Reddit, and I'm not surprised. Turns out, the average gamer really doesn't give a flying f\*ck about "Denuvo" and "live service" as long as the game is fun and exciting.

The average gamer plays games for fun, Redditors just pick sides and go to war over them without ever really playing.
        Eh, suicide squad is getting dragged through the coals on social media too. With that being said, your average gamer is still not going to care about that - just that the product is fun. I do really hope the "live service" is actually good though, because if it's not then it doesn't matter what IP you have - just look at the Avengers.
            I’m honestly just keen to play the base game as is. Truth be told, free content is cool and all but I’ll probably move on to something else by then. But the gameplay looks addicting so who knows? 

The only live service that hooks me is multiplayer. I’m not sure why? Maybe there’s more FOMO that way
        World of Warcraft has been dead/dying for almost 20 years now, almost any mmorpg discussion on reddit someone sais it and gets agreed with despite it routinely putting up some of the best numbers
            Their number of players are nowhere near where they were before, that's just a fact. Now their revenue on the other hand, with all the added microtransactions, that's probably keeping increasing.
            Ifs definitely just limping on at this point. The numbers are nowhere at all what they used to be.
        It's the same with Palworld. Most people on Twitter and Reddit *hate* it with a fiery passion, but the actual sales are insanely high for such a new gaming company. Everyone irl just views it as Pokémon with guns and thinks it's decent, meanwhile my twitter feed has been people bashing it constantly as a failure since it released.
            The Palworld discourse is really funny to watch, people were claiming that the sales are totally normal and expected when an indie game is beating out most AAA games with marketing budgets of 100+ million. Also if the game was so bad and unfinished it wouldn't have 94% out of 150k reviews on Steam.
        Come on, let's be honest, if this wasn't a harry Potter game we wouldn't come close to these numbers. The casual crowd wants to roleplay harry potter, even if it's a mediocre game. They see that Hogwarts castle and shit themselves in joy and that's it
    It's almost as if the vocal minority don't represent reality. Most people just don't give a shit about the little things people complain about.

        Well that sounds unreasonable tbh. The quality and achievements of The Witcher 3 are well known amongst anyone even remotely interested in video games. Even if you don't personally like it (I sure don't) you should be able to see why it is so highly regarded as one of the all time greats. 

As with anything, enthusiasts of any hobby tend to have a slightly warped view of the reality the activity. By indulging in online discussions about games you naturally distance yourself from the average joe, whose interaction with games doesn't go beyond playing half an hour of Tekken once a week. That is okay, but you have to be aware of it. 

By accusing everyone of lying, you come off as incredibly close minded, like everyone is wrong and you are right. That is not the case. 
Taking everything as fabricated lies is no better than taking any garbage opinion as absolute fact. The truth lies somewhere in the middle.
    Harry Potter's world has endless possibilities. IMO the books only cover like 10% of the possibilities in that universe. This game is a very good start & will only lead to better games in the future.
    Spider-Man 2 is a good example of this. 90 metacritic, 9.0 user score, 9.3 imdb, 90 opencritic, 97% recommend. The game has sold/is selling amazing even going as far as to break a record for PlayStation yet somehow the majority opinion on Reddit is that it's an objectively bad game and a terrible disappointment
    I just think it's because we haven't gotten a Harry Potter game in what 10 years? I thought it was an ok game. Wish they went into the spells in the game but I hope the success of this game shows that the hype is still there and they make a great game in that universe.
    That’s pretty much any forum. You come on here and something with great reviews and sales will be talked about like it was terrible.
    Lots of examples of the reddit being completely out of touch. Diablo 4, while not a perfect game, was generally well reviewed and liked by people who bought it. But go on reddit and you'll be greeted with countless page-long dissertations about how it's pretty much the worst game ever and if you like it, you're an idiot. The vast majority of people will play through the campaign once or twice, but the super loud minority expect this game to be an endlessly replayable MMO
    Harry Potter books are basically Lord of the Rings for kids and young teens. 

The writing is at the perfect level for middle schoolers and up to read, even some elementary schoolers too read easily.

It creates a really good world that kids would fantasize about being in (and a surprising number of adults).

It has a massive fanfiction community. 

So honestly it's not surprising that so many new kids keep reading the books, following movies, etc.
        Kids? Bro it's millennials. The nostalgia is big. 
            Yeah lmao. Harry Potter fans are like 30 years old now. They aren't kids anymore haha
                Not really true. My nephew (10 y/o) just came out of her Elsa phase and jumped straight into Hermione mood. At the end of the day is quite a natural passage if you are looking for someone to identify with
                    It also makes sense since a lot of people who grew up with it are probably reading harry potter to their own kids now.
                The original Harry Potter kids have pre-teens now that are getting into it
            Of course, but kids enjoy it a lot as well. Pokémon started off with millennials, but most kids in my family like it too, for example.
    How do you mean?
Still mad that you can’t change the seasons after beating the game. Would have loved to platinum it during the winter to make it feel truly magical
    Unlucky for me the game bugged out and winter returned after doing Poppy's quests after the main story. 

I hate it!
They'll also be releasing the PS5 exclusive launch quest for free to other platforms, which is nice. While I do enjoy the game, I'm glad that I won't need to pay $15 to $20 for the add on.
    The PS5 exclusive quest was literally the best quest in the entire game.

The exclusive thing already has done its effect anyway, so they can release it to other platforms.
        > The PS5 exclusive quest was literally the best quest in the entire game.

I'd argue that the side quest with that Slytherin boy could be a contender for best quest along side that one.  I enjoyed that it didn't have a happy ending, rather, it left me sad.
            I love Sebastian's questline, story, and character. It brought more greyness into the world of Harry Potter, making Slytherins look not as evil or cowardly.
        Perfect for patientgamers like myself! Can’t wait to play this in a year or so. Now I am delving in Guardians of the Galaxy and I am in awe how great it is!
            Damn i'm doing thr same thing. I'm playing Guardians right now and i'll wait for Hogwarts when everything will be in it.
    Any info on when it’s gonna be released ?
        "later this summer" but if you have the pc version you can turn it on with mods.
>“A very consistent message coming from the executive layer of Warner Bros. Discovery is the importance of franchises,” he said.
“There’s a unique and important role games have in keeping our franchises relevant, resonant and exciting, because there’s plenty of fans and plenty of people consuming content where games are their starting point.”
Warner Bros previously said that it planned to turn its biggest games IP into live-service titles."

oh no.
Always remember, kids: The opinions of twitter never matter!

            Honestly I enjoyed that sub before the entire HL disaster. There was some good jokes and good commentary. Not anymore lol
            Am I missing something? I thought it was a shit posting sub. Are you saying they're being serious?
    They must be having a heart attack.

[Wired's Harry Potter 1/10 review ](https://www.wired.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/)
        This writer is terrible, clearly has an agenda and is categorically false. Wired is officially shit
        I don't care about this game at all but this is completely embarrassing. 
        This is hilarious in the context of the games commercial success, but furthermore, it is comically false in its commentary also. I skimmed through it, and especially when it says home isn't home anymore and it's divorced from the book descriptions I had to comment just to say the castle in Hogwarts Legacy is one of the most detailed and exquisite representations of any place in the entire history of representing books in other forms of media
    Anyone who thought this game wasn't going to do gangbusters was frankly delusional.
        GCJ in a nutshell.
        I saw dudes acting like they were saving gaming itself by buying copies.
    Remember when you couldnt even mention the game here at launch? Embarrassing. 
    Or reddit lol. Did you forget how anybody who played the game was transphobic here too?
    Yeah I remember when Jimquisition released her video and said that if you bought the game you couldn't be a trans ally, and then downplaying the abuse some people were receiving just for playing the game. That was a weird time to be in the gaming sphere.
        I mean, the first mistake was listening to Jimquisition in the first place. Her and MovieBob are really two of the worst online reviewers that are still around, and it's hard to understand why at this point, since they're both just bitter, hateful pieces of shit.
            Yeah I sadly agree. I used to quite enjoy her content, but now it seems like EVERYTHING has to be negative, there's always something to complain about or someone to blame for something. I get it, negativity drives views. But it just feels so constant now, and delivered in such a smug, self congratulating way. (Doesn't help that from what I recall she screwed over her editor in terms of paying him and having him live with her, then accusing him of making her relive trauma when he asked for a raise)
        She was right
            I saw a Youtube short from a trans woman who said the same thing, but then the comments were full of trans people saying she was wrong and that they were loving the game. So I don't think the blanket statement really works.
            [deleted]
                thats a weird take, she will still get the money. doesnt really matter if you buy on sale or not. just play the game if you want to and reclaim the harry potter universe from her, or dont. the game is really diverse, there are trans characters and whatever. the developers definitely deserve the money, first part of the game was glorious und made with so much love for Hogwarts.
                You seriously cannot be this stupid.
                How is JK Rowling far right?
                    It looks like if someone doesn't agree with the far-left even on one thing, they are far-right. It doesn't matter if everything else they believe in is left.
                        I guess, lol
    b-b-b-but it had no nominations at the Game Awards????? That clearly showed the game was a failure???
I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing it. The world they made was fun to explore. Just wish you could play quidditch or go to Diagon Alley. Hopefully in the sequel!

        They hated him, for he told them the truth.
There’s a bunch of senior management at my work that are a few rows away from me.   
They normally talk inane BS that I don’t really care about, families, the work place, boring weekends and especially this one guy just constantly talks soccer.   
But today they were talking about this and how they had all bought it.   
That’s when I suddenly understood why it’s so massive.
Remember when people were boycotting this game and harassing streamers who streamed it ? 

Fat lotta good that did LOL
    As a trans person, me and absolutely every other trans person I know didn’t do any harassing of streamers. I’m not saying no trans people did, but I suspect the loudest and most aggressive of the harassers were just trolls who A) also bought the game and B) probably harass trans people too
        C) cis people doing things on behalf of trans people.
    Raised awareness didn't it? Can't stop people siding with assholes tho
        The genius classic move of;

>"Hmmm these people are all on the fence about an issue"

>"I will spray them all with a firehose of hate and names to get them to come to my side!"

>"Wait why did they go to the other side?"

That's quite literally the entire boycott, gj on pushing people to disagree with you 👍
        yes, it raised awareness that the game exists, so even more people bought it, good job!
        Yes it was such a great idea to bully and threaten people for your “awareness”. Go touch some grass.
The game is fine but I have never seen a game that sold this well that went on sale as frequently as this did. It was bizarre seeing it being the best selling game yet on sale for 30-50% off all year last year.
    That's to lure people in who want to play the game because of the books or the movies but normally opt for a different genre; and/or to convince parents to buy it for their child/children.
    Thats the right way to do it, palworld sold 8m copies in a few weeks and stayed on sale
        To be fair, wasn't that sale price like $4 off?
            Yeah, it was just a typical Steam launch sale.
    Sales usually happen either because it isn't selling and they think lower price will help, or its overselling and they can afford to.

Because if you sell 10m copies and then put it on sale, there probably is 10m more people who weren't willing to put that money down but now are at the new price. You can afford to lose profit because you already made it, and taking that chance likely leads to MUCH more profit anyway.
        There are also many gamers from countries either terrible exchange rates who can’t afford the game with its full price.  Sales helped many in mine currently.
Remember when people tried to cancel/boycott this game. 

Personally love the game and feel bad for who missed out on it.
Suck it r/gamingcirclejerk
Can we finally discuss the most popular game of 2023 lmao it was so strange the way any mention was shut down for the longest time 

It was a lot of fun
    What are you talking about, there’s been countless posts about this game? Sure, it’s not been discussed as much as TotK / BG3 etc., but that’s because it’s aggressively mid in a year full of bangers.
        Yea, that's like saying, "how come nobody is talking about the new fifa game even though it sold so many copies".

There would be nothing of note to talk about even without the controversy. The people that like it, played it and moved on.
        When it was released this sub had a specific rule banning any and all discussion - this was for months and only seems to have gone away relatively recently. 

You could be banned for even bringing the game up when it released.  Which was bizarre - it was and still is the most popular game of the year and this place banned discussion on it.
gamingcirclejerk put more money in JKR' account for this game than the marketing budget ever could have
    Yeah this little indie franchise was gonna fly under everyone's radar without their help.
    This is a bs take... A polished hp game is one of the easiest game to sale.
    Lmao yeah. I literally bought a copy specifically to spite them. Thankfully, I also enjoyed the game proper
        You spent $60 on a video game to spite people you don’t know on the internet, who don’t know you, and who also don’t know you bought the game? 

Yeah you showed them……
        Really? Did really buy a game just to one up some random nobody's on internet.
        You are a very sad individual.
        Well what's important is that you continue to loudly express your contempt of Trans people as they are legislated back into the shadows. Good for you! Very brave, to play a video game. My hero!
            Wasn't there a trans character in the game? Not many games that can boast that.
                [There's a fair few.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_with_LGBT_characters)
                Doesn't really make up for the fake that JKR is actively against the existence of trans people.
                    She's not even involved with the development of the game though.

And in what way is she?
                        -writing a book about a man dressing up as a woman to kill women.
-thinks trans women are all rapists and pedophiles trying to groom children.
-thinks all trans men are confused autistic lesbians.

I could list more but I'd go over any character limits, but yes she does actively state these opinions and encourages others to harass trans people.
                            Oh man, you’d hate to hear about a little movie called “Psycho”….
                            Any sources to back this up? I know about the book already.
                                [Here 's](https://www.vox.com/culture/23622610/jk-rowling-transphobic-statements-timeline-history-controversy) an article on the more overtly transphobic things she's done.

For a more nuanced look on the subtle ways JKR's bigotry operates I'd recommend [ContraPoints's video](https://youtu.be/7gDKbT_l2us) on the subject.
                                It's very public, and I know twitter isn't exactly a source but it's not like it's a medical paper, you can go onto her twitter account and the whole thing will be filled with her opinions regarding trans people. JKR doesn't hide it.
                                    Classic JKR hating thread 

> JKR wants trans people dead

> gets asked for examples

> "go educate yourself"

> <insert literally any rebuttal>

> "you transphobic fuck"
                                    The point is you can’t actually back it up. Again you’re parroting other people’s nonsense.
                                Here's a good [TIMES article about JK.](https://time.com/5855633/jk-rowling-gender-identity/)
                            All of this is utter drivel. Step outside your bubble and actually read her words.
                    What did she say that's against the existence of trans people?
                    She’s not at all. You’re misinformed or knowingly spreading BS. Don’t believe rubbish other people are telling you. Actually read what she’s said.
                        I have read exactly what she's said and yes she is transphobic.
Loved this game, Hogwarts had an insane level of detail, all the easter eggs and animated (“alive”) objects were a really nice touch
    For real. Felt like a kid watching the movies again. But it was even better because this time it's your own adventure in that world.
It’s crazy theirs not one planned DLC yet.
i would LOVE a dlc without any dramatic story, just a year in school
A perfectly average game. 

PS: didn't say anything negative but somehow someone got offended
    Maybe so. But I absolutely loved it.   Chill game and it did what it was supposed to.  100% completed it and moved on. 

Genuinely looking forward to anything else they have.
    The world was amazing but the story was average. Overall a decent game.
        Story was very average but damn I loved Hogsmead in the fall.  Beautiful scenery!
        The world was boring, hogwarts was amazing. A good to go game.
    [deleted]
    And there’s nothing wrong with that.
    The most mid game of all time
    I don't know, I wouldn't call it average, it was quite good, not a 10/10 but definitely a high 8. Which is well above average
obligatory comment that the boycott did nothing
The game nailed absolutely everything *except* the gameplay. Which is a real problem.

As a sort of theme park style tour for the wizarding world, it's great. As a good video game, not so much. I get it's more of a game for Harry Potter fans both new and old who don't necessarily play video games, but man, as a gamer it sure as hell can be boring...

Still glad it did well, the devs deserve it. I just hope they learn some gameplay lessons for next time.
    The story was meh but the combat gameplay was great i think.
        Yeah, my only gripe is how they don't let you unlock perks until you finish the first act. The combat really gets great after you unlock the ability to do that diving dodge.
    Exactly. I couldn't finish it. My wife however loved it and put tons of hours into it
    What do you mean by gameplay? Flying was solid. Combat was very good. Exploring Hogwarts and finding secrets was excellent.

As far as depth, it wasn't very good. No karma/decision systems, no way to really "build" your character differently, and a very linear game path.
        > Flying was solid. Combat was very good. Exploring Hogwarts and finding secrets was excellent.

I feel like I feel the polar opposite on all of these points...

Traversal in general was a slog, and game performance made it worse. It got better toward the end as you unlocked faster flying and more flying modes, but anything that required traversal like races, *balloon popping (urgh)* was all just... a chore.

Combat was incredibly boring, and only a step above combat I'd expect to see in a lego game. Memorize one combo, and it can carry you throughout the entire game. Even on the hardest difficulties, it's far too easy and has no depth at all. Which isn't helped by the pitiful array of magic available to you... It's literally game *about magic.* In my playthrough I had to quit the game and start again on the hardest difficulty because I was just breezing through everything. There is no challenge at any point during the game.

Exploring hogwarts *was* great, because the world design is stellar, but the items, puzzles, and challenges you find in those exploring phases are just... awful. These are the sorts of puzzles you show to babies to help them learn spatial reasoning... There are so many of them as well, which is great... *as long as they don't have like 6 variants...* It's an absolute chore working through all of them. And most of the gear is uninspired palette swaps that just screams the design choices made when making this game. I.e, they only had a tiny amount of actual content, and had to stretch it over this massive game. They're beating a dead hippogryph.
            And with these downvotes lies the terrible gaming truth, casuals rule the world.
                Downvotes because he's objectively wrong about combat. A single pattern of spells absolutely will not get you through the game because of resistances/armor, attack patterns, etc.
                    Actually i got carried the entire game by using whatever single patern of spells were available. I have no shame in saying i just spammed whatever was the without a cooldown. At best you just have to look out for when to dodge some very telegraphed attacks and parries and maybe remove a shield with a color spell to match, because often you can just yeet stuff at enemies to break shields.

The game remains absolutely mediocre though
        Flying was very awkward on a keyboard. That and the puppy mill aspect of breast breeding made me lose interest in the game. 

I probably should redo the key binds to match wow flying or invest in a controller and finish the game.
        Oh yea, build aspect was SUPER weak
I think this game sold so well because it was so simple. 

Everyone one of my family/friends who never play video games at all got this game because they're Harry Potter fans and all of them completed it, family had to borrow my PS5 for it lol
    I think the game sold well because of how popular the Harry Potter franchise is and because the game wasn't a complete dumpster fire. 

Beyond that, I think the quality (or lack of it) was not very relevant in how well it sold.
        Maybe you misunderstood me with the quality comment or are you just saying that in general?

When I say it was so simple I’m saying the gameplay loop is easy to understand, it’s not difficult like a souls, it’s just right for an average audience which helps draw in Harry Potter fans, that definitely helps with sales because it keeps selling, if it was insanely difficult or hard to play for the average user it wouldn’t have a good word of mouth recommendation
buT iTs tRaNsPhObiC REEEEE
We did it Reddit !!
Gamingcirclejerk were throwing tantrums spoiling everything for others thinking they were doing something 😂
How’s that boycott going?
24million originally satisfied but left wanting people.
Good for Harry Potter fans I guess.
It’s such a great game. Love it.
Remember when Reddit communities were screaming spoilers at the top of their lungs in order to tank sales.

Felt a lot like the oil protesters who sit on the road and throw paint at things, you not only have failed to accomplish your goal, but now people also hate you.
Impossible. Internet said everyone should hate this game otherwise they are transphobes. Why wasn’t the boycott successful???

/s
Very cool, this game also looks interesting
I was never gonna play this, then people started getting bullied off twitch for playing it, then I had to buy it
No surprise there
Big W for gamers. WB&co. will think twice filling their games with live service carp. This will still sell in 10 years, I doubt suicide squad will.

    Baldurs Gate 3 just won GOTY and it's woke af so..... Cope?
        Doesn’t that prove it doesn’t matter?
            Yes? Idk what point you think I was making. The guy is claiming that woke people are losing and that "the tides are changing" meanwhile much of what is popular could be considered woke by any of the vague descriptions "anti-woke" people use.


I wouldn't consider widespread mainstream success to be an indication that they're losing this culture war.
        [removed]
            My point is that a "woke" game won GOTY. Another woke game (Spider-Man 2) was nominated for GOTY and was highly successful. TOTK is arguably woke as well given Nintendo deliberately made Link more feminine to appeal to female gamers. 


So, again, it sounds like you're coping.
    Wokeism is a disease
        What's wokeism?
            Anything conservatives don’t like.
                [removed]
                    "Conservative" as a term is not restricted to the US.
    Do you even know what woke means? Or do you just use it for "people I don't like"
        What's the problem? He did use the term correctly here.
        Fuck im sick of hearing people yell about how everything is woke. Gotta be the dumbest people on the planet.
    Yeah haha
    re: your edit. nobody's seething my friend. you were the one who brought the issue up. 

it's not woke or oversensitive to acknowledge that trans people exist, have always existed, deserve respect and autonomy, and deserve to not be discriminated against. this isnt scary or complicated. it's human decency.

attempting to read into a wider cultural phenomenon from vague numbers such as game sales or internet downvotes reveals your ignorance.
        Wow, bunch of manbabies downvoted you huh? <3
    it's not idiotic to want to stop money getting to a politically active transphobe. if she was racist wouldnt you think differently? but not for transgender people?
        The people complaining went about it the wrong way, horrible harassing the hell out of people for simply playing a game, as a result the whole movement was and it's still looked at with disdain.
            some of the people went about their complaints the wrong way. it's bad but ultimately it's not relevant to the stated issue. to bring that up is changing the subject tbh.
        the thing is. I dont give a fuck
        If she was racist I wouldn’t think differently. I consume media that I don’t consider to be problematic. I don’t care who made it, as long as the media doesn’t promote hate.
            but... the money you gave her... is used to promote hate. what dont you get about that?
                Whether she got money from the game or not, it doesn’t matter. She will still have a Twitter account into the foreseeable future, even if all her projects fail…

If I played the game, how does that promote hate against trans people? She gets money? And? Her main method of spreading hate isn’t money based… 

She isn’t an elected official either, so it’s not like she can pass anti-trans bills. Unless there’s some lobbying she’s done to push anti trans laws I don’t know of? Not like she can run out of money doing that considering she’s a billionaire…
                I seperate art from the artist. If it’s good art it should be paid for. I pirated Hogwarts Legacy.
                    why do you separate the art from the artist? the artist sometimes uses their money they got from making art for non-art things. that's important to think about.
                        It’s important to you. Not to me.
                            but you just said you wouldnt buy a game that promotes hate. but youd buy a game whose payment goes to promote hate, simply because it's within the realm of "the artist" and not within the fiction of the product you bought. very inconsistent. is it possible you just dont want to have to think about the world critically in this way?
                                I don’t like hate so I don’t consume it, it’s perfectly consistent.
                                    so as long as the hate doesnt affect your enjoyment of the media youre ok?
                            I like your attitude.
        [removed]
            no she really is. why argue things you dont know about?
                [removed]
                    >no u
            She absolutely is

Here’s an article if you don’t want to watch videos 

https://www.vox.com/culture/23622610/jk-rowling-transphobic-statements-timeline-history-controversy

J.K. Rowling is a transphobe.
                        Yeah, at this point anyone who argues that she isn't is showing their own colors.  It's widely known, it's not at all hidden, and there are *plenty* of people/sites that have done comprehensive discussions on the subject.

                        [removed]
            That's a really weird thing to say about someone who would tell you straight up that she hates trans people lol.
                She never said that
                    She would if you asked tho. Everything she's done and said demonstrates how much she hates trans people.
                        No proof
    As a "woke idiot" i literally couldn't give less of a shit if the game is a best seller or whatever.

It kind of seems like you're the one seething btw, are you okay?
The game was okay but the NPC's were horrible, they showed no emotion whatsoever
    This isn't true, the emotions were simply all positive, because they want you to feel that magical harry potter feeling. The characters laugh, smile, show gratitude etc. The most negative we got was basically worry.
That boycott sure showed them!
One of my favorite games, it gave me the feeling of home that i was looking for. I am grateful, that i could play this game and i am sad that there is no dlc
I bought it during the winter sale and after 8 hours I'm pretty bored. Gameplay is a bit too simple and plot is pretty basic.
This is the game that got my wife into gaming even if it was just due to it being in her favorite book universe but she really had a good time here with this one!
So much for boycotting it.
Possibly the most unsuccessful boycott of all time
Great game, deserves the success it gains
Surely those harassment and doxxing pages paid off so much
A tiny game that was not worth mentioning during the game awards.
Wow. Great boycott. Much success.
I’m not sure why people are acting smug that one of the most well known franchises in the world spawned a successful game. Seems like a lot of people took the boycotts oddly personally? Not sure what skin you had in the game, but it’s okay to acknowledge that jk Rowling is a horrible person to a lot of people.
    Yeah, I don't think anyone that boycotted it thought that was going to do any major harm to the game's success.  Harry Potter is far too big of a cultural touchstone, it was going to go gangbusters as long as the game looked decent and didn't crash immediately on load.
It was a fun game, I got a good 30-ish hours of entertainment out of it. I only wish they had made the world outside of Hogwarts/Hogsmead a little more interesting. The Merlin trials were promising until I figured out there only were like four different ones that repeat over and over, the weird platform things you just have to land on to unlock seemed a little simplistic, the balloon course you fly through seemed pretty meh. I feeel they could have done much more with the game but all in all it was enjoyable enough
 Loved exploring in this game. Some of the side stories were better than the main quests though
Super fun game, glad I picked it up and did a play through it
I personally don't get the hype around thi game. Found the characters really cheesy and cringe, found it was extremely repetitive, and not much if a story plot to it. 

It has legs, the fighting mechanics and how easy it was to change spells etc was great. Just wouldn't put this game up there for game of the year etc. And the ability not to play big parts of howarts that I was expending did suck for me
    There is no hype around this game.... It was hyped when it came out, died down after a month. It sells well cause its HP. I bought it cause its HP..m
        Well, it's HP, but also WB put it on sale like two months after it launched and it continued to see frequent and significant sales throughout last year. It was 50% off for weeks throughout the holidays. They were desperately trying to make it the best selling game of the year.
        24million sales for a no big tech company is hype? I know it doesn't seem a lot but it's the first game that beat fifa in the UK selling charts. Yeah agreed it sells well cause HP but it does have a lot of hype and attention as without that HP link it's bang average
            Hype was just around that time. You literally did not hear about it after that initial month. So the hype was about harry potter universe, not the game...
Boycott went well, then
Great game. Played it only on the Switch and I had a blast. Put roughly around 75 hours before finishing it up.
Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio
It made me feel like I was part of that universe for a short time, I loved it.
One of the few games I enjoyed playing from start to finish recently.
Love the game but I still have not beat the game yet hahahaha. Too many other games I gotta play too.
Stunningly average game carried by the Harry Potter label
One post about this game whose comments aren’t full of shite jokes / rants about another subreddit, that’s all we ask. Will never happen!
I bought it on sale during christmas holidays and really enjoyed it. Exploring the castle was the best part and kinda reminded me of the first game back in the day for PC.

And i also thought it's kinda ironic that this game received so much hate online because of the whole JKR and transphobia thing but at the same time i've never played a game with such diverse characters. You have openly gay teachers, a trans woman, students and teachers of all sorts of nationalities and so on.
Decent game but really gets carried by the Happy Potter license.  Terrible camera and mostly repetitive fetch quests.  Maybe it was better on PC, watching my GF play it on PS5 was rough.
[removed]
    ...velio. revelio... Revelio....
    Colaaaaaaa
Some of it's success was due in part thanks to the haters. They gave this game millions of dollars worth of free advertising.
Awesome game. Though there could have been more stuff to do besides the main quest line. Magical creatures could have been made more difficult to obtain. More in depth quests that gave some reward worth getting. Being able to explore other settings like a full on quest inside azkaban. Where you have to go through a whole maze of corridors and cells spanning multiple floors. 

The ps exclusive quest did disappointed me though. 

Overal great experience, nice graphics, being able to fly.. awesome game.
It wasn't the perfect game but I enjoyed my time with it! It's also so refreshing to see a single player game without microtransactions do so well!
Hogwarts Legacy is a game I can unironically describe as "the best cash grab of all time."
Man I hope they use this insane amount of profit to make a really polished sequel. Otherwise I'm going to be hella salty.
I'll still wait till its like £20 or less...not a huge fan of Harry Potter but do fancy playing. Just not in a rush and can wait without issue as I got far too much to play so even if I bought it now at full price, I still wouldn't get to it for a few years. I like to play one game at a time till I finish it, I'm old, can't do like 10hrs of say Assassins Creed and then try to go back to it a few months later, can't remember the controls, what I was doing and die way too easily so end up restarting so easier to do one at a time...its a massive money saver
    I picked it up for like 30 euros, used disk for PS5.

Honestly its worth it. I like the visuals, the castle etc, etc. However I feel like they intended to make it replayable, but there is no way in hell I would replay it.
    I got it over the holidays for about £18 and it was well worth the price. Similar boat to you, not a Potterhead but enjoyed the books enough to be interested in this. Took me around 45 hours to finish but that was doing quite a lot of optional content and quests too.
        I have GP so anything I really fancy that I don't own gets priority which can be annoying when you wanna finish some of your backlog games. Far cry 6 is a massive game, finished the story last night after playing it since the release on GP, though will keep it installed to get a couple of achievements.

See I would be jumping on AC Val but they did a one day sales when it was like 17.99 for the complete edition. Might try some smaller games till Tuesday, see whats coming onto GP in the new list
And you still can’t sit 💀
Game should have been only in Hogwarts, forbidden forest (more detailed) and hogsmeade. Everything else way mediocre and I would say way too underdeveloped. Some RPG Elements were not necessary. But everything else was top notch and imagine they would have put even more time in those.
I will be a hater here, just to get it out of the way. Terrible plot, terrible characters, and it fucking was riddled with the cancer of modern day open world game design (being only slightly more palpable then something like shadow of war).

Alright.. that's my hater comment. I will say a great thing about the game is it really showed some great bones or proof of concept. If they can make things alittle less safe/more interesting, and steer away from it feeling like a hogwarts marvel film in terms of dialogue and interactions, I think the next installment could be amazing.
I wish there was a morality system, during the day Hogwarts student… at night she would venture into the woods and slaughter everyone she came across. My character I called “the nightmare bitch”
I enjoyed the game immensely. I100%it and haven’t touched it again.
It’s too bad they ditched quidditch and refused to do and dlc
    A separate game *Quidditch Champions* is in development. I agree though, PVP Quid (or even AI bot matches) would’ve been an amazing addition.
Great world, particularly the castle, but the game was meh, the sidequest were too repetitive
Was a good game had a fun time getting all the achievements.
The magic system was disappointingly simplistic.
Platinumed it a week and a half ago and have literally zero interest to go back to it now. 

It's a fun game but I don't think it has a lot of replayability and even replaying it to get the trophies for the other 3 houses I basically speed ran each one in an hour to just get to the mission required for the trophy.
Solid first entry for the studio; they’re gonna have to do a ton for the second game tho to improve on all the downsides.
Still can’t believe they didn’t add any post game content. Maybe they didn’t think it would sell a bajillion copies but they didn’t think of adding any dlc
Any rumors of this coming to Game Pass?
My first 20 hours of this game was great, had so much fun running around Hogwarts discovering all the little details and secrets. My enjoyment definitely fell off a cliff tho as I was forced more and more out into the open world. I honestly wish they cut out the outer two thirds of the open world to focus more on a smaller, more confined map.
It was… I loved playing the game and the atmosphere but once the story was over I lost interest very quickly.
Massive sales for a mid game. The world design is great but the story and plot are just meh. One of the few games in years I haven’t bothered to finish.
What's weird is how they haven't announced a dlc or a sequel. I know they're making a quidditch game but I'd love for the sequel to be more adventurous or in a different school like NY or Uganda
A terribly written game loop using popularity as its platform. Waste of money.
Man and a game like Palworld blew this out the water lol. Imagine that.
    Palworlds around 8m sales so far. Hogwarts legacy sold over 12m in its first 2 weeks. Palworld might reach that but currently it hasn’t it’s just broken concurrent player records on steam so far
I was playing it over the winter holidays, and I have to say that I actually enjoyed it. 

For my taste there are a bit too many cutscenes, which make especially the first few hours feel more like an interactive movie, but it gets better after that.

Most of all, I enjoyed the combat, which was really very well tailored and balanced. Especially after Elden Ring, which has this really tough and very unforgiving fight mechanics, it was really a joy to cast spells like a proper Slytherin student should do :-)

The broomstick flying was also fun, but a bit difficult to control on a game pad. Probably easier on a keyboard/mouse setup.

My biggest complaint though is that the main story arc was rather simplistic, especially in comparison to the story of Sebastian, who is the guy that will teach you all the "unforgivable" curses. They really should have put this story into the center...

Still, it is a good game. You should try it – especially now that one can get it for cheap from 3rd party sites ;-)
ok. Do we really need updates about this tho
    Yes
As a souls addict, I thought this game would make a nice change of pace, and tbh I really enjoyed my play though! The combat was lacking but still enjoyable. 

I especially loved exploring the game. And it ran flawlessly on my pc which was a massive bonus. Very Well optimised. 

Also I'm glad I didn't listen to the abuse I got when I mentioned I wanted to try the game on release, keep petty politics out of gaming I say!
Shit game carried by ip and one location.
    Womp womp
a really great harry potter game i hope they made more and with depth and full on RPG
It's really disheartening to see that people don't give a shit about the suffering of others if it prevents them from enjoying whatever boiler plate IP they happen to have nostalgia for.
    Who is suffering?
    Just like you didn't go see any star wars movies after they were bought by disney, the racist/antisemetic company, right? Because a lot of older disney stuff has racist and antisemitic connotations which hurts people so you as a good boy didn't give them any money anymore, right?
Too bad it was mediocre anyway.
Worst AAA game Of that year
Mad considering it is shit.
Incredible for such a mediocre Game. But its like Marvel Movies, Quality does not matter. People watch/play trash if it had a huge marketing budget.
And the didn’t get a mention at the ~~Game~~ Ad Awards…?
    By this logic Call of Duty should get nominated every year. Sales do not equal quality. I can't think of any category where HL should've been nominated over what did get nominated. Maybe should've taken Starfields spot for one of the "best RPG" nominations but that's about it.
    it sold well because people were starving for a AAA harry potter game, doesn't mean it was an outstanding game tho'
    You take that award show seriously?
Also with the backlash and drama, I can see why it didn't. Otherwise the show would of had a mob there waiting to tear people apart over it.
        It was too mid to ever win an award even if JK wasn’t a transphobe
    Came out at the start of the year. Award shows have recency bias.
        It’s not recency bias. Games don’t get nominations just because of sales.
I was really surprised not to see this on any of the goty lists. I am not really into HP, but I remember seeing a lot of reviewers loving it because of fulfilling the fantasy of studying in Hogwarts. I would have expected to see it at least on some personal lists…
An empty game for people who care more about nostalgia feefees than basic decency 💩 let's all throw money at an asshole to look at the empty castle. Wankers
    The salt, you can taste it
This game sucked
How disappointing.
one could say, it was a mediocre video game, but a great harry potter game.
    I am totally fine with that.
        Indeed

Harry Potter game I expected and was promised and Harry Potter game I did get. 

Cant say the same about other games of other famous IP's. People are still waiting for good Avengers or DC.

And this game being a bit "simple" makes it much easier for people who are not into gaming actually buying this game just because they want to experience the Wizarding world.

And if you ask me a sequel can ONLY improve on what they did here.
            Crazy to think that the best marvel videogame to date was made by the Lego team.
                Yeah it is a great shame 

I did enjoy the Midnight Suns game. Customizing your hero and making your deck for them. It was also fun to have so many heroes working together and interacting.
                    I’m so disappointed that this game didn’t catch on 

It was far from perfect but I had a lot of fun playing it
                    im still waiting midnight sun -75 with all dlc
                    I hope they don't feel discouraged by sales. I'd love a midnight suns sequel.
                        I would like it as well.

With more customization options and maybe actual relationships with other heroes. And also more impactful choices because the dark and light didn't matter in my opinion when it comes to the story. Also more diverse missions and not just Hydra and those monster enemies.
                            My only gripe is I hate hate hated the character you play as. I’d rather play as one of the cool, interesting Marvel characters than generic hero B.
                                I don't mind it. 

I just wish our choices could shape our hero better and have more range of customization when it comes to our abilities. 

Like, let's say Strange could show you how to cast some spells pushing you to be more magic-oriented. Or training with Cap and Carol to be more melee and physically oriented. 

That alone would make our hero better and more connected to the world.
                        An X-men game in this style could be absolutely amazing!
                Huh... Spider-Man is a Marvel game?
                    Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man, yes.
                    Disney doesn't even make marvel games. They in fact disolved lucasarts games. 😮‍💨

We have sony and their insomniac to thank as well as Respawn for the Jedi games with Cal Kestis as the lead and even then they dropped the ball so hard on PC.
                    That’s more Sony then marvel though tbh
                        It is a still game within that fantasy world

It may not be a "Disney" game or an "MCU" game but it is absolutely a Marvel game
                        Also Marvel fans have had Marvel Vs Capcom 3 and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games.

The Deadpool game isn't groundbreaking, but it wasn't terrible.

The Guardians Telltale game was great fun

The Guardians of the Galaxy game was good quality also

And there are another 5 Marvel Games on the way
                Guardians of the galaxy is a masterpiece. I usually dont like action games and I don't like Guardians, and I loved it.
                Marvel's midnight suns, the guardians of the galaxy, insomniac's spider-man are all great. I rarely finish games but finished all of these.
                Midnight Suns for me
                This makes it sound like the lego devs don't just make excellent games in general. They've also made some of the best star wars games ever IMO. 

Also there's been some good spidey games over the years and GotG was good.
                    The only Star Wars games to ever top the LEGO ones are the old Kotor games and maybe the new Fallen Order/Survivor games (if you like Souls-esque gameplay that is). 

I enjoyed Rogue Squadron III quite a bit as a kid, but objectively speaking it was not that great of a game and I liked it as much as I did simply because the options available for Star Wars games were not great. There were also some niche successes in the MMO space, but neither Galaxies nor SWTOR really lasted all that long (yes, SWTOR technically still exists but not with any popularity really) in the grand scheme of things.
                Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy..
                I mean while we’re on the topic the best Harry Potter game was also made by Lego lol.
            Waiting for good DC? We forgetting the Arkham games?
            > And this game being a bit "simple" makes it much easier for people who are not into gaming actually buying this game just because they want to experience the Wizarding world.

This is the key that made the game so successful.

People did not buy this game for crazy and complex gameplay. They bought this game because they wanted to explore Hogwarts and the wizarding world that surrounds it. People wanted to play as a wizard and have fun checking out all the little details of a fantasy world they grew up reading.

Complex gameplay would make it harder to just pick up and wander to find all of the little pieces scattered throughout the game. It has exploration features galore though, which is exactly what this type of game (one meant for fans to explore an immersive world) needed.
            Exactly, me and my sister both bought this game, as we're both HP fans. Seeing as I play a lot of games, it was pretty easy, but I still really enjoyed it.


For my sister though it was perfect, as she mainly plays more laid back stuff like Animal Crossing.
            I’m playing this game alongside my daughter who has little gaming experience, and I think it’s just enough for her. It’s not too easy, but it’s challenging enough she might not beat a boss on her first try but try different strategies, and feel rewarded for her effort.
        I'd rather just a good game, I've played many games off the ips I like. Rarley have I played a good game off of IPS I like

This game was just boring. Never completed. Kinda the worst insult for a game. That I just didn't want to play
    It's beautifully crafted tho, The castle is really well done as well witht he environment.
    Considering there hadn’t been even a good Harry Potter game in years, the bar was low.

I do think it was a very good first attempt for this dev though considering their past games. 

I think mediocre is harsh. I’d say good. It’s on par with the worse assassin’s creed titles in terms open world collectathons with RPG elements and they’re solid games despite not being anything special.
    They put everything into the design of hogwarts, and everything else was an afterthought. Rewards are mediocre (which are just cosmetics), and room of requirement has way too many restrictions for a single-player game. 90% of side quests are just gathering random hidden things around the world. How the map edges are cut out, so you have to fly around it just to go straight.
        To the game's credit however, the combat is actually quite well done -- it's responsive and there is some element of strategic depth with the different types of spells as well as specific creatures counters. Combat was one of the most consistently enjoyable aspects of the game for myself.
            Agreed.  I really enjoyed the combat and thought the final Rookwood confrontation was a ton of fun
            Sucks you had to remove all your gear if you wanted to keep experiencing it and not one shot everything
            I thought the combat was pretty boring as well. For me it felt like it was mostly spectacle and little substance. The feeling of impact was missing and it became too much 'pew pew pew'.

It was probably good enough to carry a game in which encounters are rare, but considering the game is filled to the brim with combat situations, I was done with it around the five hour mark.
        I'm tired of "open world" games where there are the same things spread around the world.  Defeating some sort of "bad guy camp" 20 times gets old quick for me.  There is nothing unique about them.  Hogwarts, Spider-Man, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon, Infamous all have repetitive quests/areas like this.
            Yeah it's weird seeing people hate on this game, when a ton of other super well regarded games also have the same traits/issues.

I just finished Spiderman PS4 (well the PS5 version), and it is the definition of "basic-AF" open world game with collectibles and the same three or four side missions. But it's also a great Spiderman game that makes you feel like the webslinger so it's enjoyable.
                At least Spider-Man has excellent well-designed main missions. Hogwarts put lots of obvious filler right into the main campaign.
            I agree, except Hogwarts Legacy went way beyond 20 of something.  There are 95 Merlin trials.  There are 9 types, but they are all similar enough.
        > They put everything into the design of hogwarts, and everything else was an afterthought.

That would be because first and foremost it was an exploration game. A way for people to adventure in the fantasy world they grew up reading, finding all the little things that were scattered throughout Hogwarts and the surrounding area.

It was not made to be an action title with complex and engaging combat, nor was it meant to be a dramatic epic with a cinematic storyline.
    Disappointed that there was no Quidditch.

I was a legend on HP Quidditch World Cup (PS2)
        Definitely, they even had good broom flight mechanics already in place! Even just as a minigame it would have been great fun, definitely more so than some of the other minigames they did implement. 

I, too, spent far too many hours playing HP Quidditch World Cup but on Gamecube instead for me.
            Granted, the game mechanics of Quidditch are so shit that it's understandable why they wouldn't want to bring it back to public eye.

For the unfamiliar reading this comment, Quidditch's scoring system is terrible.  Imagine you're playing hockey, where you have 1 Goalie, a few defenders and a few shooters, a total of 6 players on the ice at any given time.   They're scoring and defending and just playing a normal game of hockey.  Then, add a 7th player to the each team who is completely disinterested with scoring or defending, who is off doing some difficult solo task.  The game is over when one of the team's 7th players completes their solo task.  The other 12 players scoring and defending only actually matter in the outcome in the game if one team scores 15 goals more than the other team.  

So for 90+% of games, what 12/14 players are doing makes absolutely no difference on the outcome of the game.

If Quidditch were to ever be put in a game again, I would recommend they just remove the Seeker/Golden Snitch component altogether and declare the game over after 1 hour.
                > If Quidditch were to ever be put in a game again, I would recommend they just remove the Seeker/Golden Snitch component altogether and declare the game over after 1 hour.

I think the real problem, more than the snitch, is the fact that people act like goals would be hard to score in Quidditch.

You're flying around at easily 60+ mph on brooms throwing a ball into one of 3 MASSIVE hoops, with 3 different dimensions of travel you can use to evade defenders and no restrictions on the use of your hands to control the game ball. In the books and movies they seem to describe scoring as if it were akin to soccer or hockey, with high-scoring affairs being rare. In reality it would be MUCH more similar to scoring in the NBA with each teams scoring multiple times every minute of gameplay. 

Anybody who thinks goals with a Quaffle would be any less frequent than field goals or 3-pointers in basketball is absolutely delusional.

That introduces the other problem though, which is that because scoring would be so frequent it begins to trivialize the snitch unless you can find it early enough in the game before the better combination of beaters and chasers have started to snowball their advantage. In reality the keepers would have a rather minimal effect on the game because you could just force the keeper to commit to defending one hoop and throw it instead into either of the other two hoops that was left completely open.
                    That's true.  With how valuable the Snitch is, I wonder if teams would create 2-Seeker lineups, or maybe just abandon it altogether and play 0-Seeker lineups.
                        I feel like a real-life quidditch would essentially just pull the keeper 100% of the time because a keeper would have little chance at actually stopping shots on goal for the reasons I outlined above. At best the keeper would play more like a defensive back in soccer, trying to quickly steal the ball from attacking chasers before they got to the goals and shuttle it back to their own offense.

As far as the seeker goes, that's a tough one. If you had good beaters and chasers then I would think you'd prioritize pulling the seeker as well to maximize your advantage when it comes to scoring the Quaffle as many times as possible. If your beaters and chasers were worse than the opponent's, however, then finding the snitch fast would be your top priority since it would be the only real chance for you to win.
                            Come to think of it, you have  people flying on brooms at 60 mph.  Once one team has the Quaffle, how easy would it be for them to keep it for themselves the whole game.  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.  Aren't they allowed to fly through a hoop instead of throwing it for easy points?
                                >  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.

The magical person-seeking missiles that are bludgers flying faster than you can go on a broom would be the main thing stopping that from happening. If you tried you just eventually get merced by a bowling ball which forces you to drop it.

It seems that after each goal is scored you have some kind of toss-up of the ball in the middle of the field to restart play, same as a face-off in hockey. Thus it doesn't really matter if you throw the ball or carry it through the hoop since you go back to the center face-off anyways once the goal has scored.
    Agreed to this. I'm enjoying the game at the moment but the world just feels a bit bland for me.

Enjoying how simple the game is but also I wish this game was Skyrimed abit. 

Nothing complex but damn I just want the world to react to me. I'm using unforgiveable curses left and right and yet people DGAF. 

NPC's should be killable. Deduct points to my house if I do shenanigans... don't bring me to a game over screen... wth. There should be real repercussions to what I do etc....

And just like Skyrim... allow me to pay off my sins (in the case... allow me to memory wipe witnesses like Lockhart)

Older games have done this but somehow this game is opting for the safe path.
        >NPC's should be killable. Deduct points to my house if I do shenanigans... don't bring me to a game over screen... wth. There should be real repercussions to what I do etc....

The end of year speech from Dumbledore or whoever would have been interesting... 

"And for the massacre of 5 patrons of the Hogs Head in Hogsmead, I am deducting Gryffindor 12 points."
            LMAO. Or just get a full wanted rating and have an army of aurors descend on you.
                Would be pretty sick if every game was similar to GTA. Harry Potter GTA? Pokémon GTA? Marvel and DC GTA? Dragon ball Z and Naruto GTA? GTA GTA? Lol
                    Dragonball Z GTA. Who’s gonna stop Goku’s rampage? What army?
                        Your protagonist is Yamcha
                            Ahh so like a cabbage, got it.
                        All the Kai’s come and jump you along with whiz and beerus
        No one is making a game where you can murder a bunch of 11 year olds….
            r/prequelmemes: Hello there
            I mean Skyrim also didnt allow the murder of kids. Not saying you can kill Hogwart students but adult  non essential NPCs should be killable. 

I just want to Skyrimfy the shit out of this game.
                The world or hogwarts isn’t about just randomly killing people, that would add nothing to me.  
I don’t even think those unforgivable curses should even have been in the game, and certainly not with how casually they are treated.    

There are plenty of other was to make the world more reactive without turning a teenager in to a killer.
                    > I don’t even think those unforgivable curses should even have been in the game, and certainly not with how casually they are treated.

I'd have been happier with the inclusion of unforgiveable curses if they came with consequences.

In the books and movies the ministry of magic can track every single spell ever cast by an underage wizard. They know full-well that some kid is going around Avada Kedavra-ing a bunch of trolls and goblins, but seemingly nobody cares about it.

Some sort of reputation system would have been a nice touch at least, with interactions with "good" characters becoming more negative the more you used unforgiveable curses and interactions with "evil" characters becoming more favorable and vice versa.
                    I mean... my game of reference isn't also about randomly killing people as well. 

What I generally mean is NPC's should be part of the world and not just a pretty walking vase. 

For example, if I go unlock a house, the NPC inside shouldnt just be randomly sipping tea while I ransack their chest... either pummel me unconscious or run away and report me to school. 

If I throw an exploding spell recklessly... that random npc person should be accidentally blown to bits... 

Again not fully go Voldemort but just live in a reactive world. NPC's in this game right now are nothing but pretty decorations.

My initial example was too out there... but I think you know what I mean. We both want the same thing... just a living reactive world.
                        Can you stop calling it skyrimify as if skyrim was anything more than your first example of a game like that rather than the creator or pinnacle of the type of game lol
                            Not everyone is going to have the same reference points for a given trope in media. Don't be so elitist.
        I mean, I get your criticisms, but “I should be able to slaughter people in my Harry Potter game and bribe the prefects if I get in trouble” is actually an insane take.

I would be happy with the world reacting to me more, and some increased difficulty.
            Also, could you imagine anything more stupid than being caught murdering students and then getting points deducted from your house instead of going straight to Azkaban.
        I think it was as complex as I want it to be... with the crafting, upgrading gear plus the rock-paper-scissors spell system that isn't just about damage/resist type but actually integrates physics and visuals (e.g. pulling them into range, then blasting them with short range spell). 

Not sure what gamers think is "top notch" here; does it need to have like 8 systems of inter-relating special items, special moves, special-er moves, gear/weapon art moves, pet/summon moves, co-op moves, environmentally-based moves, etc., to be happy with a third person action-adventure game?
            Complexity is often the enemy of fun. Some is good, but too many systems causes confusion. Better to have a few well-understood systems, with plenty of choices within those systems (e.g. different spells or different gear), rather than doubling the number of systems that players need to understand.
        Would be great to have the same level of modding tools, that way the community could step in and fill the gaps. Because the team made it pretty clear that they aren’t doing any DLC or additional content.
            There’s some sort of update/announcement coming soon per a recent tweet so maybe they will end up changing their mind on DLC given the game’s success.

            It's an unreal game. So you can just make blueprint plugins in UE and throw them in the game.
    100%. They had a very very high bar to try and meet, and they did a great job. The dialogue did feel like ChatGPT most times, but I was able to get over that and just enjoy it.
        Yea, if the dialog was better and the open world exploration had more unique and challenging content (way too many repeating merlin trials and caves), it would be a great game.
    "It was a mediocre video game".

Ever wonder if we've set the bar too high?

Seriously. Every post about any popular game on here seems to expect every game to be the second coming of Christ in order to hit par. 

The world needs "good" just as much as it needs "outstanding".
        "Ever wonder if we've set the bar too high?"

First i would say, the only way the bar knows is up.

But in regards to HL the Story and dialog is just that: mediocre, that's not a bar set too high.
        Id argue it was so successful because everyone set the bar so low for this one.


If it was a new IP with no association to Harry Potter it would of been forgotten within a month as another generic open world game.
        Curious to know if you've played the game? Because idk how you could (without nostalgia goggles) say it was better than mediocre.
            I have played the game. I enjoyed it a lot, even as a non-fan of Harry Potter. I played it, completed it, and moved on.

The game has beautiful visuals and the gameplay was familiar and done well. The story left a little to be desired, but story is oftentimes the hardest part to excel at. 

It's clear that they put a lot more effort into the visuals and the verisimilitude of the game world than they did the story and RPG mechanics, but in no way did I feel like and of its pitfalls made the game any less than "good".
    I was never really into the Harry Potter movies, but I really enjoyed the game!
    I think they accomplished their goal, For a first play through it’s incredibly immersive and satisfies the fantasy of attending hogwarts/ exploring the movie sets
    I was getting downvoted for this an opinion all last year. If you look at just as a video game, it’s probably a 6/10 game. 

They did good job on Hogwarts.
        In today's gaming world, 6/10 tends to be given to subpar games (weirdly). I don't think this game is *that* bad. It's more of a "pretty good" not "good/great" game.

It looks great, plays well, and executes it's mechanics very well. It just isn't deep, unfortunately.
            On a scale that is used properly, 6/10 is accurate. On the scale that video game reviewers use, 6/10 basically means "completely unplayable trash", in that case, not an accurate description of HL.
            Yeah I think the main issue I had with it was the over hypedness of it. Lack RPG elements and any elements they did add, were basic.

The whole bottom portion of the map didn’t need to exist from a story perspective. Feels a lot like they took on more than they could handle.

Edit: personally don’t know if I want to replay it and I’m a big HP fan. A game like cyberpunk thought, I’m itching for a second play through.
        Yea, that's mob mentality + honey moon phase for you
        Not in a world where Spider-Man 2 gets GotY noms it isn't. If you want to say SM2 is also a 6/10, I'll agree. But as far as 3rd person open world adventure games goes HL was miles ahead of it.
    Like DBZ Kakarot
    That's exactly what it was. 
    In a world where executing a "mediocre" video game is too hard for some mega franchises this was an absolute master class on give the fans what they want and it will sell.
    >one could say, it was a mediocre video game, but a great harry potter game.

So the same as all Harry Potter media.
    Really? I think it might go the other way. The expectations for a AAA HP game are way higher than they would be for a similar game that wasn't a massive media franchise license.   


While uneven mechanically and yes it is 15% Ubisoft bullshit.. there is also the graphics, sound, voice talent, characters and story (even separate from the HP-ness).. relatively seamless transition of flying/walking, respectable crafting and upgrade system.. amazing level of character customization.

Overall it's at least 8/10 purely on its technical merits. I think we call it mediocre \*because\* it is Harry Potter and "how dare it not blow us away in every respect. "
    It could be, but it's not.
I can't say that game good, if there is no good gameplay, or storyline and characters, or something innovative.
    I just thought mediocre all around.


For a game called Hogwarts Legacy they really love making you spend most your time outside of Hogwarts.
10/10 Hogwarts exploration sim. 

4/10 everything else. 

7/10 overall, in my opinion.
More specifically, the atmosphere of Hogwarts itself was a 12/10 

the surrounding area was maybe a 7 or 8, but damn the school had so much detail and felt so alive
    I spent the first 6 hours of the game just exploring Hogwarts. Not doing quests, not trying to collect things, just absolutely mesmerized that I am finally inside a fully-realized school that I've dreamed of since I was a little kid. It sounds insane, or at least very fanboyish, but I shed a few tears during my exploration, simply because of how gorgeously detailed the entire castle was.
    They should have just put more details and quests into Hogwarts itself instead of trying to add on a generic open world area

Also the many unlockable outfits feel out of place (school dress codes are normally strict) and many quests that require killing was kind of lazily copying other open world RPGs where you grind enemies too
I was told the game was bad, came to check reddit, encountered the most toxic subreddit r/gamingcirclejerk..  made me play the game
    That sub was occasionally fun until they absolutely lost their shit over this particular game and couldn't stop mention it in 99% of their posts for months.
        They where couped by tankies in April 2022 after the tankie mod removed the other mods beacuse the former mods made fun of the tankie's trying to mint NFT coins.
            what are tankies? 
    I got permanently banned for making a single comment in a discussion thread about the state of the sub at the time - "This sub has become a parody of itself".

Apparently, I've since been unbanned so I guess someone somewhere came to their senses.
    The game is fucking great.
    That place has become such a toxic shithole and it spread pretty quickly to other subreddits. Most normal people would agree that liking the HP brand itself doesn't make you a JK Rowling-supporting transphobe (I would assume most fans  in general aren't chronically online weridos who know or care about every single moral crusade going on), but boy did a lot of people on that sub act like it did! I gave up trying to engage because they all wanted to practice extreme essentialism and I was just tired of it.

I'm going to predict the paragraph above might get me some angry replies that will automatically assume that I'm one of those "JK Rowling-supporting transphobes" because they lack nuance and reading comprehension.
and that was the case with the source material. Atmosphere and world building made HP great, maybe also some characters, while story was just there to keep it going.

Game is the same, maybe lacking in characters this time. I can’t complain though, enjoyed it a lot for the same reasons I enjoyed HP before.

Yeah, it did it well. Repetitive and simple but idk was worth the money I spent and had fun

Just upset there was some bugs that prevented me from a platinum but I had my fun with it
If it wasn't Harry Potter themed it would be a sub-par RPG
Still kinda mad they didn’t add a NG+. Could’ve done some really fun stuff with the O.W.L’s influencing the next play through
> was a bit too easy 

Because, like the books, it needs to be accessible for an 8 year old.
Yeah hit the nail on the head for a hogwarts game, but I grew bored with it because of the combination of easy combat(even on hardest difficulty) and uninspired  story.
Yeah, it's a really atmospheric game.
For me, personally, it's become a problem, because of that it was already to late, when I realized that no any other good features presented in Hogwarts, and I lost moment to make a refund.
Yeah, I kind of wish it had different difficulty settings. I'm not someone who chooses to play games on hard by any means, but still was too easy. I get it's made so non-gamers and younger kids enjoy it, as I'd guess they are the main target audience, it's also the reason why they (I think) chose a simpler storyline and sidequests. 

Still, a harder difficulty so you have to optimize your spells and perhaps having to level up certain spells or other mechanics would've made it more interesting. As you said, the game was still enjoyable and I don't regret it at all, and my girlfriend who is a Harry Potter fan enjoyed watching me play it as well.
So you want to be a student who bangs their teacher?
    Of course, have you seen Hagrid?
        Now imagine Hagrid as a sexy maid
            We all can access AI generated images, remember..
                But then Hagrid has 6 toes in my face.
                    Is that a problem?
    YES PLEASE

ahh... professor garlick...
    I'm sorry, but I have done enough research on Professor Garlick to be okay with this.
    So Fire Emblem Three houses?
    \*Acid Jazz Intensifies\*
    Professor sprout can get it
Honestly I would've been much happier for it being just school sim instead of creating this generic "chosen one" story. The game was good but I still would like to just have Harry Potter RPG where you can just go to school, choose your own classes, maybe join quidditch team, explore the castle and grounds, develop relationships with other students etc.

As Potter fan, I am happy what they gave us. But I really hope that one day we get more school focused game where you can just be part of the world as normal student.
Been always saying this. HP would work perfectly in that style. Shame i doubt it will happen though. I liked Hogwarts Legacy but for the most part honestly never really felt like I was a an actual student at hogwarts. Going through every day of the year would be awesome alongside a couple of dungeon/palace type missions.
    Wasn’t there an old sorcerers stone PS1 game that had a lot of this?
    Wasn’t there an old sorcerers stone PS1 game that had a lot of this?
Or bully. But I wanted to actually feel like a student to where my classes, attendance and such are also game mechanics that are possible to fail. 


Shit the opening to the original fable game captures the feeling of growing up in a magic academy better.
I just want a Harry Potter game that doesnt have some weird world ending doom plot shoehorned in. It doesnt need it
dude just straight up give me a turn-based jrpg harry potter game and i think i would pay 200 dollars and my left leg for it
    There was one for Game boy advance! Bit dated of course but I remember having fun with it
        I'm pretty sure it was for the GameBoy Color, and there were two. I also remember having fun with them! There was a lot of disappointment when I found that the GBA games weren't the same style.
It takes talent and vision to make a persona game. ;)
The triumph of the game was Hogwarts itself. Actual story was a bit meh but as a concept it was phenomenal. A sequel that utilises the castle again but maybe puts more emphasis on the student experience at Hogwarts instead of another "chosen one" narrative will be incredible. So much potential here
    This is basically it. The world is what everyone loves about Harry Potter. The actual stories told within that world and the systems underlying it have always been decent at best but the world itself? That we wanted more of.
        I think the Harry Potter story was very good. Maybe I just love then so much cause I grew up reading and watching them I watched them everytime they aired on TV and in the game walking the halls with RTX On was just an nostalgic expirence the game's story could have been a  better I agree. The world of Harry Potter always makes you wanting more of it
            >The world of Harry Potter always makes you wanting more of it

The first Fantastic Beasts movie hit this itch super hard. At least where he's in his little zoo.
                Yesss seeing all the magical beasts makes you just fall in love with the world. And whenever just in a trailer while browsing a streaming service you hear the main theme and you instantly want to start watching that movie.
    Yeah i didn't care for the story at all but exploring the castle was 100% worth it. Usually i don't care about collectables but i had so much fun exploring hogwarts that i collected everything it had to offer.
    Combat was solid, too. The way spells could combo together was super fluid and clever.
    I really wanted DLC, I want to keep the spells I learned and all the outfits I unlocked.  I am not sure I will pay to start fresh again, unless it’s a different character altogether.
    Bully and witcher 2 are games they should take from. Bully with its student experience and NPC interaction and wicther 2 for its branching  main story.
Pretty much.....it's like Skyrim in HP world
There really isn’t a “gaming community” any more than there is a “TV watching community.” It’s not a niche hobby anymore and the people online are just a tiny fraction of the user base.
Reddit is disconnected from reality in pretty much every facet. The majority opinion on Reddit is rarely a reflection of the majority of people IRL.
    The boycott people are usually pretty loud. While the people who don’t care…. Usually don’t care and will just move on and buy what they enjoy
        we can also extend this to....people who are upset are very vocal

people who don't care won't participate

twitter and reddit seem like they're always upset with everything because of this.

like even if I have a contrary opinion and I see a community of people all malding, I'm gonna scroll on by without commenting because I'd rather not get a bunch of reddit cares and angry DMs
    This makes sense because Reddit consists of the hardcore player base of a game, whereas most players are casuals. Hardcore players and casual players care about different things.
        The best way to stop enjoying a game is to be on the Reddit for it. If you were enjoying it you'll get brainwashed in the negativity and change your mind or just feel bad for enjoying it.

Current path of exile Reddit is slowly turning into a nice place once you've finished the mandatory 1-2 weeks of a league launch where everyone is beta testing the league for them.
            >The best way to stop enjoying a game is to be on the Reddit for it. 

I enjoy browsing r/SatisfactoryGame.

It seems like the more niche the game, the more wholesome the community is. Purely anecdotal since idk about the other communities i don't take part in.
                This is always true in my experience. I blame the fact that popularity brings kids into communities but it could be just cope for people being people
                The same is true for DRG. one of the best gaming communities. ROCK AND STONE!
                Same with factorio.. no time to argue when THE FACTORY MUST GROW!!!
                This really does depend. The battle brothers subreddit is really good if you want end game advice. It's fucking trash if you're starting out because every other post is "trash bro, dump him, you'll never do the end game locations that are only meant for the hardcore players with that bro". 

Which is funny in itself because there are people who have cleared that location with average bro's.
            I mean I'm on subreddits for games I love the community is very harsh of and it's never once made me dislike a game. I enjoy playing the game. Everything outside of me enjoying the game has no impact on my enjoyment. And if I don't enjoy the game then no matter how much people sing it's praises I won't play it since I don't enjoy it. Basically just play like you what even if everyone you see and hear is saying it's trash. I'll enjoy living in my dump then.
                Yep. Other people don’t change my enjoyment.
            The rimworld sub is surprisingly wholesome considering what the game is
            Depends on the game. Joining r/warthunder brought me peace knowing I'm not the only one being dragged through the mud every day
            It also removes the enjoyment of figuring out a game for yourself. Take Palworld as an example, its way more fun to run around aimlessly and feel the surprise/excitement of stumbling across a rare pal or a new boss or something rather than reddit telling me which dudes are worth leveling/where to get them and which dudes should stay in the palbox.

        > This makes sense because Reddit consists of the hardcore player base of a game

It's even more disconnected than that.

Reddit usually consists of a subgroup. Yes, more 'hardcore' players, but still not a general reflection of the 'hardcore' playerbase, they're a mix of 'hardcore', 'nerds', primarily pc players rather than console, and permanently online. 

It's a niche inside a niche. (Like almost everywhere on the internet)
        The other thing to consider is that, of the "hardcore" players, like in all aspects of life, most are just chilling and not commenting positive/negatively. The vocal minority is a sliver *of a sliver.*
        I don't think this is a correct assumption. At best you can say that the reddit portion of a games population is the population that uses reddit.
            Don’t care
        Reddit also thought it was unfathomable let alone impossible for somebody like Trump to win presidency, but here we are. I never liked Trump and never voted for him, but I constantly got called a Trump supporter because I told people to vote and be wary of him.

I promise you those same idiots will still tell me I’m wrong and downvote me here too. Mostly because they still exist here and are still disillusioned.
    Spider-Man 2 is a good example of this. 90 metacritic, 9.0 user score, 9.3 imdb, 90 opencritic, 97% recommend. The game has sold/is selling amazing even going as far as to break a record for PlayStation yet somehow the majority opinion on Reddit is that it's an objectively bad game and a terrible disappointment.
    Some people have ample community in their lives, some don’t. Some who don’t seek community online. Those that don’t have ample community tend to get their opinions on world event from mass media which usually has a particular way of looking at things. Harry Potter = bad now being one of those opinions.
Go to Universal Studios (any of them across the globe) and visit the Harry Potter park. It will always be packed full, no matter when you visit.
It shows up with Call of Duty every single year. Reddit convinces themselves this is it, this is the failure...and it tops the sales charts.

Honestly I think it's happening again with Suicide Squad. The narrative on social media platforms is a lot different than on Reddit, and I'm not surprised. Turns out, the average gamer really doesn't give a flying f\*ck about "Denuvo" and "live service" as long as the game is fun and exciting.

The average gamer plays games for fun, Redditors just pick sides and go to war over them without ever really playing.
    Eh, suicide squad is getting dragged through the coals on social media too. With that being said, your average gamer is still not going to care about that - just that the product is fun. I do really hope the "live service" is actually good though, because if it's not then it doesn't matter what IP you have - just look at the Avengers.
        I’m honestly just keen to play the base game as is. Truth be told, free content is cool and all but I’ll probably move on to something else by then. But the gameplay looks addicting so who knows? 

The only live service that hooks me is multiplayer. I’m not sure why? Maybe there’s more FOMO that way
    World of Warcraft has been dead/dying for almost 20 years now, almost any mmorpg discussion on reddit someone sais it and gets agreed with despite it routinely putting up some of the best numbers
        Their number of players are nowhere near where they were before, that's just a fact. Now their revenue on the other hand, with all the added microtransactions, that's probably keeping increasing.
        Ifs definitely just limping on at this point. The numbers are nowhere at all what they used to be.
    It's the same with Palworld. Most people on Twitter and Reddit *hate* it with a fiery passion, but the actual sales are insanely high for such a new gaming company. Everyone irl just views it as Pokémon with guns and thinks it's decent, meanwhile my twitter feed has been people bashing it constantly as a failure since it released.
        The Palworld discourse is really funny to watch, people were claiming that the sales are totally normal and expected when an indie game is beating out most AAA games with marketing budgets of 100+ million. Also if the game was so bad and unfinished it wouldn't have 94% out of 150k reviews on Steam.
    Come on, let's be honest, if this wasn't a harry Potter game we wouldn't come close to these numbers. The casual crowd wants to roleplay harry potter, even if it's a mediocre game. They see that Hogwarts castle and shit themselves in joy and that's it
It's almost as if the vocal minority don't represent reality. Most people just don't give a shit about the little things people complain about.

    Well that sounds unreasonable tbh. The quality and achievements of The Witcher 3 are well known amongst anyone even remotely interested in video games. Even if you don't personally like it (I sure don't) you should be able to see why it is so highly regarded as one of the all time greats. 

As with anything, enthusiasts of any hobby tend to have a slightly warped view of the reality the activity. By indulging in online discussions about games you naturally distance yourself from the average joe, whose interaction with games doesn't go beyond playing half an hour of Tekken once a week. That is okay, but you have to be aware of it. 

By accusing everyone of lying, you come off as incredibly close minded, like everyone is wrong and you are right. That is not the case. 
Taking everything as fabricated lies is no better than taking any garbage opinion as absolute fact. The truth lies somewhere in the middle.
Harry Potter's world has endless possibilities. IMO the books only cover like 10% of the possibilities in that universe. This game is a very good start & will only lead to better games in the future.
Spider-Man 2 is a good example of this. 90 metacritic, 9.0 user score, 9.3 imdb, 90 opencritic, 97% recommend. The game has sold/is selling amazing even going as far as to break a record for PlayStation yet somehow the majority opinion on Reddit is that it's an objectively bad game and a terrible disappointment
I just think it's because we haven't gotten a Harry Potter game in what 10 years? I thought it was an ok game. Wish they went into the spells in the game but I hope the success of this game shows that the hype is still there and they make a great game in that universe.
That’s pretty much any forum. You come on here and something with great reviews and sales will be talked about like it was terrible.
Lots of examples of the reddit being completely out of touch. Diablo 4, while not a perfect game, was generally well reviewed and liked by people who bought it. But go on reddit and you'll be greeted with countless page-long dissertations about how it's pretty much the worst game ever and if you like it, you're an idiot. The vast majority of people will play through the campaign once or twice, but the super loud minority expect this game to be an endlessly replayable MMO
Harry Potter books are basically Lord of the Rings for kids and young teens. 

The writing is at the perfect level for middle schoolers and up to read, even some elementary schoolers too read easily.

It creates a really good world that kids would fantasize about being in (and a surprising number of adults).

It has a massive fanfiction community. 

So honestly it's not surprising that so many new kids keep reading the books, following movies, etc.
    Kids? Bro it's millennials. The nostalgia is big. 
        Yeah lmao. Harry Potter fans are like 30 years old now. They aren't kids anymore haha
            Not really true. My nephew (10 y/o) just came out of her Elsa phase and jumped straight into Hermione mood. At the end of the day is quite a natural passage if you are looking for someone to identify with
                It also makes sense since a lot of people who grew up with it are probably reading harry potter to their own kids now.
            The original Harry Potter kids have pre-teens now that are getting into it
        Of course, but kids enjoy it a lot as well. Pokémon started off with millennials, but most kids in my family like it too, for example.
How do you mean?
Unlucky for me the game bugged out and winter returned after doing Poppy's quests after the main story. 

I hate it!
The PS5 exclusive quest was literally the best quest in the entire game.

The exclusive thing already has done its effect anyway, so they can release it to other platforms.
    > The PS5 exclusive quest was literally the best quest in the entire game.

I'd argue that the side quest with that Slytherin boy could be a contender for best quest along side that one.  I enjoyed that it didn't have a happy ending, rather, it left me sad.
        I love Sebastian's questline, story, and character. It brought more greyness into the world of Harry Potter, making Slytherins look not as evil or cowardly.
    Perfect for patientgamers like myself! Can’t wait to play this in a year or so. Now I am delving in Guardians of the Galaxy and I am in awe how great it is!
        Damn i'm doing thr same thing. I'm playing Guardians right now and i'll wait for Hogwarts when everything will be in it.
Any info on when it’s gonna be released ?
    "later this summer" but if you have the pc version you can turn it on with mods.
gamingcirclejerk in shambles rn

        Honestly I enjoyed that sub before the entire HL disaster. There was some good jokes and good commentary. Not anymore lol
        Am I missing something? I thought it was a shit posting sub. Are you saying they're being serious?
They must be having a heart attack.

[Wired's Harry Potter 1/10 review ](https://www.wired.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/)
    This writer is terrible, clearly has an agenda and is categorically false. Wired is officially shit
    I don't care about this game at all but this is completely embarrassing. 
    This is hilarious in the context of the games commercial success, but furthermore, it is comically false in its commentary also. I skimmed through it, and especially when it says home isn't home anymore and it's divorced from the book descriptions I had to comment just to say the castle in Hogwarts Legacy is one of the most detailed and exquisite representations of any place in the entire history of representing books in other forms of media
Anyone who thought this game wasn't going to do gangbusters was frankly delusional.
    GCJ in a nutshell.
    I saw dudes acting like they were saving gaming itself by buying copies.
Remember when you couldnt even mention the game here at launch? Embarrassing. 
Or reddit lol. Did you forget how anybody who played the game was transphobic here too?
Yeah I remember when Jimquisition released her video and said that if you bought the game you couldn't be a trans ally, and then downplaying the abuse some people were receiving just for playing the game. That was a weird time to be in the gaming sphere.
    I mean, the first mistake was listening to Jimquisition in the first place. Her and MovieBob are really two of the worst online reviewers that are still around, and it's hard to understand why at this point, since they're both just bitter, hateful pieces of shit.
        Yeah I sadly agree. I used to quite enjoy her content, but now it seems like EVERYTHING has to be negative, there's always something to complain about or someone to blame for something. I get it, negativity drives views. But it just feels so constant now, and delivered in such a smug, self congratulating way. (Doesn't help that from what I recall she screwed over her editor in terms of paying him and having him live with her, then accusing him of making her relive trauma when he asked for a raise)
    She was right
        I saw a Youtube short from a trans woman who said the same thing, but then the comments were full of trans people saying she was wrong and that they were loving the game. So I don't think the blanket statement really works.
        [deleted]
            thats a weird take, she will still get the money. doesnt really matter if you buy on sale or not. just play the game if you want to and reclaim the harry potter universe from her, or dont. the game is really diverse, there are trans characters and whatever. the developers definitely deserve the money, first part of the game was glorious und made with so much love for Hogwarts.
            You seriously cannot be this stupid.
            How is JK Rowling far right?
                It looks like if someone doesn't agree with the far-left even on one thing, they are far-right. It doesn't matter if everything else they believe in is left.
                    I guess, lol
b-b-b-but it had no nominations at the Game Awards????? That clearly showed the game was a failure???
[removed]
    They hated him, for he told them the truth.
As a trans person, me and absolutely every other trans person I know didn’t do any harassing of streamers. I’m not saying no trans people did, but I suspect the loudest and most aggressive of the harassers were just trolls who A) also bought the game and B) probably harass trans people too
    C) cis people doing things on behalf of trans people.
Raised awareness didn't it? Can't stop people siding with assholes tho
    The genius classic move of;

>"Hmmm these people are all on the fence about an issue"

>"I will spray them all with a firehose of hate and names to get them to come to my side!"

>"Wait why did they go to the other side?"

That's quite literally the entire boycott, gj on pushing people to disagree with you 👍
    yes, it raised awareness that the game exists, so even more people bought it, good job!
    Yes it was such a great idea to bully and threaten people for your “awareness”. Go touch some grass.
That's to lure people in who want to play the game because of the books or the movies but normally opt for a different genre; and/or to convince parents to buy it for their child/children.
Thats the right way to do it, palworld sold 8m copies in a few weeks and stayed on sale
    To be fair, wasn't that sale price like $4 off?
        Yeah, it was just a typical Steam launch sale.
Sales usually happen either because it isn't selling and they think lower price will help, or its overselling and they can afford to.

Because if you sell 10m copies and then put it on sale, there probably is 10m more people who weren't willing to put that money down but now are at the new price. You can afford to lose profit because you already made it, and taking that chance likely leads to MUCH more profit anyway.
    There are also many gamers from countries either terrible exchange rates who can’t afford the game with its full price.  Sales helped many in mine currently.
What are you talking about, there’s been countless posts about this game? Sure, it’s not been discussed as much as TotK / BG3 etc., but that’s because it’s aggressively mid in a year full of bangers.
    Yea, that's like saying, "how come nobody is talking about the new fifa game even though it sold so many copies".

There would be nothing of note to talk about even without the controversy. The people that like it, played it and moved on.
    When it was released this sub had a specific rule banning any and all discussion - this was for months and only seems to have gone away relatively recently. 

You could be banned for even bringing the game up when it released.  Which was bizarre - it was and still is the most popular game of the year and this place banned discussion on it.
Yeah this little indie franchise was gonna fly under everyone's radar without their help.
This is a bs take... A polished hp game is one of the easiest game to sale.
Lmao yeah. I literally bought a copy specifically to spite them. Thankfully, I also enjoyed the game proper
    You spent $60 on a video game to spite people you don’t know on the internet, who don’t know you, and who also don’t know you bought the game? 

Yeah you showed them……
    Really? Did really buy a game just to one up some random nobody's on internet.
    You are a very sad individual.
    Well what's important is that you continue to loudly express your contempt of Trans people as they are legislated back into the shadows. Good for you! Very brave, to play a video game. My hero!
        Wasn't there a trans character in the game? Not many games that can boast that.
            [There's a fair few.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_with_LGBT_characters)
            Doesn't really make up for the fake that JKR is actively against the existence of trans people.
                She's not even involved with the development of the game though.

And in what way is she?
                    -writing a book about a man dressing up as a woman to kill women.
-thinks trans women are all rapists and pedophiles trying to groom children.
-thinks all trans men are confused autistic lesbians.

I could list more but I'd go over any character limits, but yes she does actively state these opinions and encourages others to harass trans people.
                        Oh man, you’d hate to hear about a little movie called “Psycho”….
                        Any sources to back this up? I know about the book already.
                            [Here 's](https://www.vox.com/culture/23622610/jk-rowling-transphobic-statements-timeline-history-controversy) an article on the more overtly transphobic things she's done.

For a more nuanced look on the subtle ways JKR's bigotry operates I'd recommend [ContraPoints's video](https://youtu.be/7gDKbT_l2us) on the subject.
                            It's very public, and I know twitter isn't exactly a source but it's not like it's a medical paper, you can go onto her twitter account and the whole thing will be filled with her opinions regarding trans people. JKR doesn't hide it.
                                Classic JKR hating thread 

> JKR wants trans people dead

> gets asked for examples

> "go educate yourself"

> <insert literally any rebuttal>

> "you transphobic fuck"
                                The point is you can’t actually back it up. Again you’re parroting other people’s nonsense.
                            Here's a good [TIMES article about JK.](https://time.com/5855633/jk-rowling-gender-identity/)
                        All of this is utter drivel. Step outside your bubble and actually read her words.
                What did she say that's against the existence of trans people?
                She’s not at all. You’re misinformed or knowingly spreading BS. Don’t believe rubbish other people are telling you. Actually read what she’s said.
                    I have read exactly what she's said and yes she is transphobic.
For real. Felt like a kid watching the movies again. But it was even better because this time it's your own adventure in that world.
Maybe so. But I absolutely loved it.   Chill game and it did what it was supposed to.  100% completed it and moved on. 

Genuinely looking forward to anything else they have.
The world was amazing but the story was average. Overall a decent game.
    Story was very average but damn I loved Hogsmead in the fall.  Beautiful scenery!
    The world was boring, hogwarts was amazing. A good to go game.
[deleted]
And there’s nothing wrong with that.
The most mid game of all time
I don't know, I wouldn't call it average, it was quite good, not a 10/10 but definitely a high 8. Which is well above average
The story was meh but the combat gameplay was great i think.
    Yeah, my only gripe is how they don't let you unlock perks until you finish the first act. The combat really gets great after you unlock the ability to do that diving dodge.
Exactly. I couldn't finish it. My wife however loved it and put tons of hours into it
What do you mean by gameplay? Flying was solid. Combat was very good. Exploring Hogwarts and finding secrets was excellent.

As far as depth, it wasn't very good. No karma/decision systems, no way to really "build" your character differently, and a very linear game path.
    > Flying was solid. Combat was very good. Exploring Hogwarts and finding secrets was excellent.

I feel like I feel the polar opposite on all of these points...

Traversal in general was a slog, and game performance made it worse. It got better toward the end as you unlocked faster flying and more flying modes, but anything that required traversal like races, *balloon popping (urgh)* was all just... a chore.

Combat was incredibly boring, and only a step above combat I'd expect to see in a lego game. Memorize one combo, and it can carry you throughout the entire game. Even on the hardest difficulties, it's far too easy and has no depth at all. Which isn't helped by the pitiful array of magic available to you... It's literally game *about magic.* In my playthrough I had to quit the game and start again on the hardest difficulty because I was just breezing through everything. There is no challenge at any point during the game.

Exploring hogwarts *was* great, because the world design is stellar, but the items, puzzles, and challenges you find in those exploring phases are just... awful. These are the sorts of puzzles you show to babies to help them learn spatial reasoning... There are so many of them as well, which is great... *as long as they don't have like 6 variants...* It's an absolute chore working through all of them. And most of the gear is uninspired palette swaps that just screams the design choices made when making this game. I.e, they only had a tiny amount of actual content, and had to stretch it over this massive game. They're beating a dead hippogryph.
        And with these downvotes lies the terrible gaming truth, casuals rule the world.
            Downvotes because he's objectively wrong about combat. A single pattern of spells absolutely will not get you through the game because of resistances/armor, attack patterns, etc.
                Actually i got carried the entire game by using whatever single patern of spells were available. I have no shame in saying i just spammed whatever was the without a cooldown. At best you just have to look out for when to dodge some very telegraphed attacks and parries and maybe remove a shield with a color spell to match, because often you can just yeet stuff at enemies to break shields.

The game remains absolutely mediocre though
    Flying was very awkward on a keyboard. That and the puppy mill aspect of breast breeding made me lose interest in the game. 

I probably should redo the key binds to match wow flying or invest in a controller and finish the game.
    Oh yea, build aspect was SUPER weak
I think the game sold well because of how popular the Harry Potter franchise is and because the game wasn't a complete dumpster fire. 

Beyond that, I think the quality (or lack of it) was not very relevant in how well it sold.
    Maybe you misunderstood me with the quality comment or are you just saying that in general?

When I say it was so simple I’m saying the gameplay loop is easy to understand, it’s not difficult like a souls, it’s just right for an average audience which helps draw in Harry Potter fans, that definitely helps with sales because it keeps selling, if it was insanely difficult or hard to play for the average user it wouldn’t have a good word of mouth recommendation
Nah. She's not
Baldurs Gate 3 just won GOTY and it's woke af so..... Cope?
    Doesn’t that prove it doesn’t matter?
        Yes? Idk what point you think I was making. The guy is claiming that woke people are losing and that "the tides are changing" meanwhile much of what is popular could be considered woke by any of the vague descriptions "anti-woke" people use.


I wouldn't consider widespread mainstream success to be an indication that they're losing this culture war.
    [removed]
        My point is that a "woke" game won GOTY. Another woke game (Spider-Man 2) was nominated for GOTY and was highly successful. TOTK is arguably woke as well given Nintendo deliberately made Link more feminine to appeal to female gamers. 


So, again, it sounds like you're coping.
Wokeism is a disease
    What's wokeism?
        Anything conservatives don’t like.
            [removed]
                "Conservative" as a term is not restricted to the US.
Do you even know what woke means? Or do you just use it for "people I don't like"
    What's the problem? He did use the term correctly here.
    Fuck im sick of hearing people yell about how everything is woke. Gotta be the dumbest people on the planet.
Yeah haha
re: your edit. nobody's seething my friend. you were the one who brought the issue up. 

it's not woke or oversensitive to acknowledge that trans people exist, have always existed, deserve respect and autonomy, and deserve to not be discriminated against. this isnt scary or complicated. it's human decency.

attempting to read into a wider cultural phenomenon from vague numbers such as game sales or internet downvotes reveals your ignorance.
    Wow, bunch of manbabies downvoted you huh? <3
it's not idiotic to want to stop money getting to a politically active transphobe. if she was racist wouldnt you think differently? but not for transgender people?
    The people complaining went about it the wrong way, horrible harassing the hell out of people for simply playing a game, as a result the whole movement was and it's still looked at with disdain.
        some of the people went about their complaints the wrong way. it's bad but ultimately it's not relevant to the stated issue. to bring that up is changing the subject tbh.
    the thing is. I dont give a fuck
    If she was racist I wouldn’t think differently. I consume media that I don’t consider to be problematic. I don’t care who made it, as long as the media doesn’t promote hate.
        but... the money you gave her... is used to promote hate. what dont you get about that?
            Whether she got money from the game or not, it doesn’t matter. She will still have a Twitter account into the foreseeable future, even if all her projects fail…

If I played the game, how does that promote hate against trans people? She gets money? And? Her main method of spreading hate isn’t money based… 

She isn’t an elected official either, so it’s not like she can pass anti-trans bills. Unless there’s some lobbying she’s done to push anti trans laws I don’t know of? Not like she can run out of money doing that considering she’s a billionaire…
            I seperate art from the artist. If it’s good art it should be paid for. I pirated Hogwarts Legacy.
                why do you separate the art from the artist? the artist sometimes uses their money they got from making art for non-art things. that's important to think about.
                    It’s important to you. Not to me.
                        but you just said you wouldnt buy a game that promotes hate. but youd buy a game whose payment goes to promote hate, simply because it's within the realm of "the artist" and not within the fiction of the product you bought. very inconsistent. is it possible you just dont want to have to think about the world critically in this way?
                            I don’t like hate so I don’t consume it, it’s perfectly consistent.
                                so as long as the hate doesnt affect your enjoyment of the media youre ok?
                        I like your attitude.

J.K. Rowling is a transphobe.
                    Yeah, at this point anyone who argues that she isn't is showing their own colors.  It's widely known, it's not at all hidden, and there are *plenty* of people/sites that have done comprehensive discussions on the subject.

        That's a really weird thing to say about someone who would tell you straight up that she hates trans people lol.
            She never said that
                She would if you asked tho. Everything she's done and said demonstrates how much she hates trans people.
                    No proof
As a "woke idiot" i literally couldn't give less of a shit if the game is a best seller or whatever.

It kind of seems like you're the one seething btw, are you okay?
This isn't true, the emotions were simply all positive, because they want you to feel that magical harry potter feeling. The characters laugh, smile, show gratitude etc. The most negative we got was basically worry.
Yeah, I don't think anyone that boycotted it thought that was going to do any major harm to the game's success.  Harry Potter is far too big of a cultural touchstone, it was going to go gangbusters as long as the game looked decent and didn't crash immediately on load.
There is no hype around this game.... It was hyped when it came out, died down after a month. It sells well cause its HP. I bought it cause its HP..m
    Well, it's HP, but also WB put it on sale like two months after it launched and it continued to see frequent and significant sales throughout last year. It was 50% off for weeks throughout the holidays. They were desperately trying to make it the best selling game of the year.
    24million sales for a no big tech company is hype? I know it doesn't seem a lot but it's the first game that beat fifa in the UK selling charts. Yeah agreed it sells well cause HP but it does have a lot of hype and attention as without that HP link it's bang average
        Hype was just around that time. You literally did not hear about it after that initial month. So the hype was about harry potter universe, not the game...
...velio. revelio... Revelio....
Colaaaaaaa
I picked it up for like 30 euros, used disk for PS5.

Honestly its worth it. I like the visuals, the castle etc, etc. However I feel like they intended to make it replayable, but there is no way in hell I would replay it.
I got it over the holidays for about £18 and it was well worth the price. Similar boat to you, not a Potterhead but enjoyed the books enough to be interested in this. Took me around 45 hours to finish but that was doing quite a lot of optional content and quests too.
    I have GP so anything I really fancy that I don't own gets priority which can be annoying when you wanna finish some of your backlog games. Far cry 6 is a massive game, finished the story last night after playing it since the release on GP, though will keep it installed to get a couple of achievements.

See I would be jumping on AC Val but they did a one day sales when it was like 17.99 for the complete edition. Might try some smaller games till Tuesday, see whats coming onto GP in the new list
A separate game *Quidditch Champions* is in development. I agree though, PVP Quid (or even AI bot matches) would’ve been an amazing addition.
Palworlds around 8m sales so far. Hogwarts legacy sold over 12m in its first 2 weeks. Palworld might reach that but currently it hasn’t it’s just broken concurrent player records on steam so far
Yes
Womp womp
Who is suffering?
Just like you didn't go see any star wars movies after they were bought by disney, the racist/antisemetic company, right? Because a lot of older disney stuff has racist and antisemitic connotations which hurts people so you as a good boy didn't give them any money anymore, right?
By this logic Call of Duty should get nominated every year. Sales do not equal quality. I can't think of any category where HL should've been nominated over what did get nominated. Maybe should've taken Starfields spot for one of the "best RPG" nominations but that's about it.
it sold well because people were starving for a AAA harry potter game, doesn't mean it was an outstanding game tho'
You take that award show seriously?
Also with the backlash and drama, I can see why it didn't. Otherwise the show would of had a mob there waiting to tear people apart over it.
    It was too mid to ever win an award even if JK wasn’t a transphobe
Came out at the start of the year. Award shows have recency bias.
    It’s not recency bias. Games don’t get nominations just because of sales.
The salt, you can taste it
I am totally fine with that.
    Indeed

Harry Potter game I expected and was promised and Harry Potter game I did get. 

Cant say the same about other games of other famous IP's. People are still waiting for good Avengers or DC.

And this game being a bit "simple" makes it much easier for people who are not into gaming actually buying this game just because they want to experience the Wizarding world.

And if you ask me a sequel can ONLY improve on what they did here.
        Crazy to think that the best marvel videogame to date was made by the Lego team.
            Yeah it is a great shame 

I did enjoy the Midnight Suns game. Customizing your hero and making your deck for them. It was also fun to have so many heroes working together and interacting.
                I’m so disappointed that this game didn’t catch on 

It was far from perfect but I had a lot of fun playing it
                im still waiting midnight sun -75 with all dlc
                I hope they don't feel discouraged by sales. I'd love a midnight suns sequel.
                    I would like it as well.

With more customization options and maybe actual relationships with other heroes. And also more impactful choices because the dark and light didn't matter in my opinion when it comes to the story. Also more diverse missions and not just Hydra and those monster enemies.
                        My only gripe is I hate hate hated the character you play as. I’d rather play as one of the cool, interesting Marvel characters than generic hero B.
                            I don't mind it. 

I just wish our choices could shape our hero better and have more range of customization when it comes to our abilities. 

Like, let's say Strange could show you how to cast some spells pushing you to be more magic-oriented. Or training with Cap and Carol to be more melee and physically oriented. 

That alone would make our hero better and more connected to the world.
                    An X-men game in this style could be absolutely amazing!
            Huh... Spider-Man is a Marvel game?
                Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man, yes.
                Disney doesn't even make marvel games. They in fact disolved lucasarts games. 😮‍💨

We have sony and their insomniac to thank as well as Respawn for the Jedi games with Cal Kestis as the lead and even then they dropped the ball so hard on PC.
                That’s more Sony then marvel though tbh
                    It is a still game within that fantasy world

It may not be a "Disney" game or an "MCU" game but it is absolutely a Marvel game
                    Also Marvel fans have had Marvel Vs Capcom 3 and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games.

The Deadpool game isn't groundbreaking, but it wasn't terrible.

The Guardians Telltale game was great fun

The Guardians of the Galaxy game was good quality also

And there are another 5 Marvel Games on the way
            Guardians of the galaxy is a masterpiece. I usually dont like action games and I don't like Guardians, and I loved it.
            Marvel's midnight suns, the guardians of the galaxy, insomniac's spider-man are all great. I rarely finish games but finished all of these.
            Midnight Suns for me
            This makes it sound like the lego devs don't just make excellent games in general. They've also made some of the best star wars games ever IMO. 

Also there's been some good spidey games over the years and GotG was good.
                The only Star Wars games to ever top the LEGO ones are the old Kotor games and maybe the new Fallen Order/Survivor games (if you like Souls-esque gameplay that is). 

I enjoyed Rogue Squadron III quite a bit as a kid, but objectively speaking it was not that great of a game and I liked it as much as I did simply because the options available for Star Wars games were not great. There were also some niche successes in the MMO space, but neither Galaxies nor SWTOR really lasted all that long (yes, SWTOR technically still exists but not with any popularity really) in the grand scheme of things.
            Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy..
            I mean while we’re on the topic the best Harry Potter game was also made by Lego lol.
        Waiting for good DC? We forgetting the Arkham games?
        > And this game being a bit "simple" makes it much easier for people who are not into gaming actually buying this game just because they want to experience the Wizarding world.

This is the key that made the game so successful.

People did not buy this game for crazy and complex gameplay. They bought this game because they wanted to explore Hogwarts and the wizarding world that surrounds it. People wanted to play as a wizard and have fun checking out all the little details of a fantasy world they grew up reading.

Complex gameplay would make it harder to just pick up and wander to find all of the little pieces scattered throughout the game. It has exploration features galore though, which is exactly what this type of game (one meant for fans to explore an immersive world) needed.
        Exactly, me and my sister both bought this game, as we're both HP fans. Seeing as I play a lot of games, it was pretty easy, but I still really enjoyed it.


For my sister though it was perfect, as she mainly plays more laid back stuff like Animal Crossing.
        I’m playing this game alongside my daughter who has little gaming experience, and I think it’s just enough for her. It’s not too easy, but it’s challenging enough she might not beat a boss on her first try but try different strategies, and feel rewarded for her effort.
    I'd rather just a good game, I've played many games off the ips I like. Rarley have I played a good game off of IPS I like

This game was just boring. Never completed. Kinda the worst insult for a game. That I just didn't want to play
It's beautifully crafted tho, The castle is really well done as well witht he environment.
Considering there hadn’t been even a good Harry Potter game in years, the bar was low.

I do think it was a very good first attempt for this dev though considering their past games. 

I think mediocre is harsh. I’d say good. It’s on par with the worse assassin’s creed titles in terms open world collectathons with RPG elements and they’re solid games despite not being anything special.
They put everything into the design of hogwarts, and everything else was an afterthought. Rewards are mediocre (which are just cosmetics), and room of requirement has way too many restrictions for a single-player game. 90% of side quests are just gathering random hidden things around the world. How the map edges are cut out, so you have to fly around it just to go straight.
    To the game's credit however, the combat is actually quite well done -- it's responsive and there is some element of strategic depth with the different types of spells as well as specific creatures counters. Combat was one of the most consistently enjoyable aspects of the game for myself.
        Agreed.  I really enjoyed the combat and thought the final Rookwood confrontation was a ton of fun
        Sucks you had to remove all your gear if you wanted to keep experiencing it and not one shot everything
        I thought the combat was pretty boring as well. For me it felt like it was mostly spectacle and little substance. The feeling of impact was missing and it became too much 'pew pew pew'.

It was probably good enough to carry a game in which encounters are rare, but considering the game is filled to the brim with combat situations, I was done with it around the five hour mark.
    I'm tired of "open world" games where there are the same things spread around the world.  Defeating some sort of "bad guy camp" 20 times gets old quick for me.  There is nothing unique about them.  Hogwarts, Spider-Man, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon, Infamous all have repetitive quests/areas like this.
        Yeah it's weird seeing people hate on this game, when a ton of other super well regarded games also have the same traits/issues.

I just finished Spiderman PS4 (well the PS5 version), and it is the definition of "basic-AF" open world game with collectibles and the same three or four side missions. But it's also a great Spiderman game that makes you feel like the webslinger so it's enjoyable.
            At least Spider-Man has excellent well-designed main missions. Hogwarts put lots of obvious filler right into the main campaign.
        I agree, except Hogwarts Legacy went way beyond 20 of something.  There are 95 Merlin trials.  There are 9 types, but they are all similar enough.
    > They put everything into the design of hogwarts, and everything else was an afterthought.

That would be because first and foremost it was an exploration game. A way for people to adventure in the fantasy world they grew up reading, finding all the little things that were scattered throughout Hogwarts and the surrounding area.

It was not made to be an action title with complex and engaging combat, nor was it meant to be a dramatic epic with a cinematic storyline.
Disappointed that there was no Quidditch.

I was a legend on HP Quidditch World Cup (PS2)
    Definitely, they even had good broom flight mechanics already in place! Even just as a minigame it would have been great fun, definitely more so than some of the other minigames they did implement. 

I, too, spent far too many hours playing HP Quidditch World Cup but on Gamecube instead for me.
        Granted, the game mechanics of Quidditch are so shit that it's understandable why they wouldn't want to bring it back to public eye.

For the unfamiliar reading this comment, Quidditch's scoring system is terrible.  Imagine you're playing hockey, where you have 1 Goalie, a few defenders and a few shooters, a total of 6 players on the ice at any given time.   They're scoring and defending and just playing a normal game of hockey.  Then, add a 7th player to the each team who is completely disinterested with scoring or defending, who is off doing some difficult solo task.  The game is over when one of the team's 7th players completes their solo task.  The other 12 players scoring and defending only actually matter in the outcome in the game if one team scores 15 goals more than the other team.  

So for 90+% of games, what 12/14 players are doing makes absolutely no difference on the outcome of the game.

If Quidditch were to ever be put in a game again, I would recommend they just remove the Seeker/Golden Snitch component altogether and declare the game over after 1 hour.
            > If Quidditch were to ever be put in a game again, I would recommend they just remove the Seeker/Golden Snitch component altogether and declare the game over after 1 hour.

I think the real problem, more than the snitch, is the fact that people act like goals would be hard to score in Quidditch.

You're flying around at easily 60+ mph on brooms throwing a ball into one of 3 MASSIVE hoops, with 3 different dimensions of travel you can use to evade defenders and no restrictions on the use of your hands to control the game ball. In the books and movies they seem to describe scoring as if it were akin to soccer or hockey, with high-scoring affairs being rare. In reality it would be MUCH more similar to scoring in the NBA with each teams scoring multiple times every minute of gameplay. 

Anybody who thinks goals with a Quaffle would be any less frequent than field goals or 3-pointers in basketball is absolutely delusional.

That introduces the other problem though, which is that because scoring would be so frequent it begins to trivialize the snitch unless you can find it early enough in the game before the better combination of beaters and chasers have started to snowball their advantage. In reality the keepers would have a rather minimal effect on the game because you could just force the keeper to commit to defending one hoop and throw it instead into either of the other two hoops that was left completely open.
                That's true.  With how valuable the Snitch is, I wonder if teams would create 2-Seeker lineups, or maybe just abandon it altogether and play 0-Seeker lineups.
                    I feel like a real-life quidditch would essentially just pull the keeper 100% of the time because a keeper would have little chance at actually stopping shots on goal for the reasons I outlined above. At best the keeper would play more like a defensive back in soccer, trying to quickly steal the ball from attacking chasers before they got to the goals and shuttle it back to their own offense.

As far as the seeker goes, that's a tough one. If you had good beaters and chasers then I would think you'd prioritize pulling the seeker as well to maximize your advantage when it comes to scoring the Quaffle as many times as possible. If your beaters and chasers were worse than the opponent's, however, then finding the snitch fast would be your top priority since it would be the only real chance for you to win.
                        Come to think of it, you have  people flying on brooms at 60 mph.  Once one team has the Quaffle, how easy would it be for them to keep it for themselves the whole game.  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.  Aren't they allowed to fly through a hoop instead of throwing it for easy points?
                            >  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.

The magical person-seeking missiles that are bludgers flying faster than you can go on a broom would be the main thing stopping that from happening. If you tried you just eventually get merced by a bowling ball which forces you to drop it.

It seems that after each goal is scored you have some kind of toss-up of the ball in the middle of the field to restart play, same as a face-off in hockey. Thus it doesn't really matter if you throw the ball or carry it through the hoop since you go back to the center face-off anyways once the goal has scored.
Agreed to this. I'm enjoying the game at the moment but the world just feels a bit bland for me.

Enjoying how simple the game is but also I wish this game was Skyrimed abit. 

Nothing complex but damn I just want the world to react to me. I'm using unforgiveable curses left and right and yet people DGAF. 

NPC's should be killable. Deduct points to my house if I do shenanigans... don't bring me to a game over screen... wth. There should be real repercussions to what I do etc....

And just like Skyrim... allow me to pay off my sins (in the case... allow me to memory wipe witnesses like Lockhart)

Older games have done this but somehow this game is opting for the safe path.
    >NPC's should be killable. Deduct points to my house if I do shenanigans... don't bring me to a game over screen... wth. There should be real repercussions to what I do etc....

The end of year speech from Dumbledore or whoever would have been interesting... 

"And for the massacre of 5 patrons of the Hogs Head in Hogsmead, I am deducting Gryffindor 12 points."
        LMAO. Or just get a full wanted rating and have an army of aurors descend on you.
            Would be pretty sick if every game was similar to GTA. Harry Potter GTA? Pokémon GTA? Marvel and DC GTA? Dragon ball Z and Naruto GTA? GTA GTA? Lol
                Dragonball Z GTA. Who’s gonna stop Goku’s rampage? What army?

    No one is making a game where you can murder a bunch of 11 year olds….
        r/prequelmemes: Hello there
        I mean Skyrim also didnt allow the murder of kids. Not saying you can kill Hogwart students but adult  non essential NPCs should be killable. 

I just want to Skyrimfy the shit out of this game.
            The world or hogwarts isn’t about just randomly killing people, that would add nothing to me.  
I don’t even think those unforgivable curses should even have been in the game, and certainly not with how casually they are treated.    

There are plenty of other was to make the world more reactive without turning a teenager in to a killer.
                > I don’t even think those unforgivable curses should even have been in the game, and certainly not with how casually they are treated.

I'd have been happier with the inclusion of unforgiveable curses if they came with consequences.

In the books and movies the ministry of magic can track every single spell ever cast by an underage wizard. They know full-well that some kid is going around Avada Kedavra-ing a bunch of trolls and goblins, but seemingly nobody cares about it.

Some sort of reputation system would have been a nice touch at least, with interactions with "good" characters becoming more negative the more you used unforgiveable curses and interactions with "evil" characters becoming more favorable and vice versa.
                I mean... my game of reference isn't also about randomly killing people as well. 

What I generally mean is NPC's should be part of the world and not just a pretty walking vase. 

For example, if I go unlock a house, the NPC inside shouldnt just be randomly sipping tea while I ransack their chest... either pummel me unconscious or run away and report me to school. 

If I throw an exploding spell recklessly... that random npc person should be accidentally blown to bits... 

Again not fully go Voldemort but just live in a reactive world. NPC's in this game right now are nothing but pretty decorations.

My initial example was too out there... but I think you know what I mean. We both want the same thing... just a living reactive world.
                    Can you stop calling it skyrimify as if skyrim was anything more than your first example of a game like that rather than the creator or pinnacle of the type of game lol
                        Not everyone is going to have the same reference points for a given trope in media. Don't be so elitist.
    I mean, I get your criticisms, but “I should be able to slaughter people in my Harry Potter game and bribe the prefects if I get in trouble” is actually an insane take.

I would be happy with the world reacting to me more, and some increased difficulty.
        Also, could you imagine anything more stupid than being caught murdering students and then getting points deducted from your house instead of going straight to Azkaban.
    I think it was as complex as I want it to be... with the crafting, upgrading gear plus the rock-paper-scissors spell system that isn't just about damage/resist type but actually integrates physics and visuals (e.g. pulling them into range, then blasting them with short range spell). 

Not sure what gamers think is "top notch" here; does it need to have like 8 systems of inter-relating special items, special moves, special-er moves, gear/weapon art moves, pet/summon moves, co-op moves, environmentally-based moves, etc., to be happy with a third person action-adventure game?
        Complexity is often the enemy of fun. Some is good, but too many systems causes confusion. Better to have a few well-understood systems, with plenty of choices within those systems (e.g. different spells or different gear), rather than doubling the number of systems that players need to understand.
    Would be great to have the same level of modding tools, that way the community could step in and fill the gaps. Because the team made it pretty clear that they aren’t doing any DLC or additional content.
        There’s some sort of update/announcement coming soon per a recent tweet so maybe they will end up changing their mind on DLC given the game’s success.

        It's an unreal game. So you can just make blueprint plugins in UE and throw them in the game.
100%. They had a very very high bar to try and meet, and they did a great job. The dialogue did feel like ChatGPT most times, but I was able to get over that and just enjoy it.
    Yea, if the dialog was better and the open world exploration had more unique and challenging content (way too many repeating merlin trials and caves), it would be a great game.
"It was a mediocre video game".

Ever wonder if we've set the bar too high?

Seriously. Every post about any popular game on here seems to expect every game to be the second coming of Christ in order to hit par. 

The world needs "good" just as much as it needs "outstanding".
    "Ever wonder if we've set the bar too high?"

First i would say, the only way the bar knows is up.

But in regards to HL the Story and dialog is just that: mediocre, that's not a bar set too high.
    Id argue it was so successful because everyone set the bar so low for this one.


If it was a new IP with no association to Harry Potter it would of been forgotten within a month as another generic open world game.
    Curious to know if you've played the game? Because idk how you could (without nostalgia goggles) say it was better than mediocre.
        I have played the game. I enjoyed it a lot, even as a non-fan of Harry Potter. I played it, completed it, and moved on.

The game has beautiful visuals and the gameplay was familiar and done well. The story left a little to be desired, but story is oftentimes the hardest part to excel at. 

It's clear that they put a lot more effort into the visuals and the verisimilitude of the game world than they did the story and RPG mechanics, but in no way did I feel like and of its pitfalls made the game any less than "good".
I was never really into the Harry Potter movies, but I really enjoyed the game!
I think they accomplished their goal, For a first play through it’s incredibly immersive and satisfies the fantasy of attending hogwarts/ exploring the movie sets
I was getting downvoted for this an opinion all last year. If you look at just as a video game, it’s probably a 6/10 game. 

They did good job on Hogwarts.
    In today's gaming world, 6/10 tends to be given to subpar games (weirdly). I don't think this game is *that* bad. It's more of a "pretty good" not "good/great" game.

It looks great, plays well, and executes it's mechanics very well. It just isn't deep, unfortunately.
        On a scale that is used properly, 6/10 is accurate. On the scale that video game reviewers use, 6/10 basically means "completely unplayable trash", in that case, not an accurate description of HL.
        Yeah I think the main issue I had with it was the over hypedness of it. Lack RPG elements and any elements they did add, were basic.

The whole bottom portion of the map didn’t need to exist from a story perspective. Feels a lot like they took on more than they could handle.

Edit: personally don’t know if I want to replay it and I’m a big HP fan. A game like cyberpunk thought, I’m itching for a second play through.
    Yea, that's mob mentality + honey moon phase for you
    Not in a world where Spider-Man 2 gets GotY noms it isn't. If you want to say SM2 is also a 6/10, I'll agree. But as far as 3rd person open world adventure games goes HL was miles ahead of it.
Like DBZ Kakarot
That's exactly what it was. 
In a world where executing a "mediocre" video game is too hard for some mega franchises this was an absolute master class on give the fans what they want and it will sell.
>one could say, it was a mediocre video game, but a great harry potter game.

So the same as all Harry Potter media.
Really? I think it might go the other way. The expectations for a AAA HP game are way higher than they would be for a similar game that wasn't a massive media franchise license.   


While uneven mechanically and yes it is 15% Ubisoft bullshit.. there is also the graphics, sound, voice talent, characters and story (even separate from the HP-ness).. relatively seamless transition of flying/walking, respectable crafting and upgrade system.. amazing level of character customization.

Overall it's at least 8/10 purely on its technical merits. I think we call it mediocre \*because\* it is Harry Potter and "how dare it not blow us away in every respect. "
It could be, but it's not.
I can't say that game good, if there is no good gameplay, or storyline and characters, or something innovative.
I just thought mediocre all around.


For a game called Hogwarts Legacy they really love making you spend most your time outside of Hogwarts.
I spent the first 6 hours of the game just exploring Hogwarts. Not doing quests, not trying to collect things, just absolutely mesmerized that I am finally inside a fully-realized school that I've dreamed of since I was a little kid. It sounds insane, or at least very fanboyish, but I shed a few tears during my exploration, simply because of how gorgeously detailed the entire castle was.
They should have just put more details and quests into Hogwarts itself instead of trying to add on a generic open world area

Also the many unlockable outfits feel out of place (school dress codes are normally strict) and many quests that require killing was kind of lazily copying other open world RPGs where you grind enemies too
That sub was occasionally fun until they absolutely lost their shit over this particular game and couldn't stop mention it in 99% of their posts for months.
    They where couped by tankies in April 2022 after the tankie mod removed the other mods beacuse the former mods made fun of the tankie's trying to mint NFT coins.
        what are tankies? 
I got permanently banned for making a single comment in a discussion thread about the state of the sub at the time - "This sub has become a parody of itself".

Apparently, I've since been unbanned so I guess someone somewhere came to their senses.
The game is fucking great.
That place has become such a toxic shithole and it spread pretty quickly to other subreddits. Most normal people would agree that liking the HP brand itself doesn't make you a JK Rowling-supporting transphobe (I would assume most fans  in general aren't chronically online weridos who know or care about every single moral crusade going on), but boy did a lot of people on that sub act like it did! I gave up trying to engage because they all wanted to practice extreme essentialism and I was just tired of it.

I'm going to predict the paragraph above might get me some angry replies that will automatically assume that I'm one of those "JK Rowling-supporting transphobes" because they lack nuance and reading comprehension.
Asmongold is an idiot in general. I’m not sure what you expected

Wasn’t there an old sorcerers stone PS1 game that had a lot of this?
There was one for Game boy advance! Bit dated of course but I remember having fun with it
    I'm pretty sure it was for the GameBoy Color, and there were two. I also remember having fun with them! There was a lot of disappointment when I found that the GBA games weren't the same style.
This is basically it. The world is what everyone loves about Harry Potter. The actual stories told within that world and the systems underlying it have always been decent at best but the world itself? That we wanted more of.
    I think the Harry Potter story was very good. Maybe I just love then so much cause I grew up reading and watching them I watched them everytime they aired on TV and in the game walking the halls with RTX On was just an nostalgic expirence the game's story could have been a  better I agree. The world of Harry Potter always makes you wanting more of it
        >The world of Harry Potter always makes you wanting more of it

The first Fantastic Beasts movie hit this itch super hard. At least where he's in his little zoo.
            Yesss seeing all the magical beasts makes you just fall in love with the world. And whenever just in a trailer while browsing a streaming service you hear the main theme and you instantly want to start watching that movie.
Yeah i didn't care for the story at all but exploring the castle was 100% worth it. Usually i don't care about collectables but i had so much fun exploring hogwarts that i collected everything it had to offer.
Combat was solid, too. The way spells could combo together was super fluid and clever.
I really wanted DLC, I want to keep the spells I learned and all the outfits I unlocked.  I am not sure I will pay to start fresh again, unless it’s a different character altogether.
Bully and witcher 2 are games they should take from. Bully with its student experience and NPC interaction and wicther 2 for its branching  main story.
The boycott people are usually pretty loud. While the people who don’t care…. Usually don’t care and will just move on and buy what they enjoy
    we can also extend this to....people who are upset are very vocal

people who don't care won't participate

twitter and reddit seem like they're always upset with everything because of this.

like even if I have a contrary opinion and I see a community of people all malding, I'm gonna scroll on by without commenting because I'd rather not get a bunch of reddit cares and angry DMs
This makes sense because Reddit consists of the hardcore player base of a game, whereas most players are casuals. Hardcore players and casual players care about different things.
    The best way to stop enjoying a game is to be on the Reddit for it. If you were enjoying it you'll get brainwashed in the negativity and change your mind or just feel bad for enjoying it.

Current path of exile Reddit is slowly turning into a nice place once you've finished the mandatory 1-2 weeks of a league launch where everyone is beta testing the league for them.
        >The best way to stop enjoying a game is to be on the Reddit for it. 

I enjoy browsing r/SatisfactoryGame.

It seems like the more niche the game, the more wholesome the community is. Purely anecdotal since idk about the other communities i don't take part in.
            This is always true in my experience. I blame the fact that popularity brings kids into communities but it could be just cope for people being people
            The same is true for DRG. one of the best gaming communities. ROCK AND STONE!
            Same with factorio.. no time to argue when THE FACTORY MUST GROW!!!
            This really does depend. The battle brothers subreddit is really good if you want end game advice. It's fucking trash if you're starting out because every other post is "trash bro, dump him, you'll never do the end game locations that are only meant for the hardcore players with that bro". 

Which is funny in itself because there are people who have cleared that location with average bro's.
        I mean I'm on subreddits for games I love the community is very harsh of and it's never once made me dislike a game. I enjoy playing the game. Everything outside of me enjoying the game has no impact on my enjoyment. And if I don't enjoy the game then no matter how much people sing it's praises I won't play it since I don't enjoy it. Basically just play like you what even if everyone you see and hear is saying it's trash. I'll enjoy living in my dump then.
            Yep. Other people don’t change my enjoyment.
        The rimworld sub is surprisingly wholesome considering what the game is
        Depends on the game. Joining r/warthunder brought me peace knowing I'm not the only one being dragged through the mud every day
        It also removes the enjoyment of figuring out a game for yourself. Take Palworld as an example, its way more fun to run around aimlessly and feel the surprise/excitement of stumbling across a rare pal or a new boss or something rather than reddit telling me which dudes are worth leveling/where to get them and which dudes should stay in the palbox.

    > This makes sense because Reddit consists of the hardcore player base of a game

It's even more disconnected than that.

Reddit usually consists of a subgroup. Yes, more 'hardcore' players, but still not a general reflection of the 'hardcore' playerbase, they're a mix of 'hardcore', 'nerds', primarily pc players rather than console, and permanently online. 

It's a niche inside a niche. (Like almost everywhere on the internet)
    The other thing to consider is that, of the "hardcore" players, like in all aspects of life, most are just chilling and not commenting positive/negatively. The vocal minority is a sliver *of a sliver.*
    I don't think this is a correct assumption. At best you can say that the reddit portion of a games population is the population that uses reddit.
        Don’t care
    Reddit also thought it was unfathomable let alone impossible for somebody like Trump to win presidency, but here we are. I never liked Trump and never voted for him, but I constantly got called a Trump supporter because I told people to vote and be wary of him.

I promise you those same idiots will still tell me I’m wrong and downvote me here too. Mostly because they still exist here and are still disillusioned.
Spider-Man 2 is a good example of this. 90 metacritic, 9.0 user score, 9.3 imdb, 90 opencritic, 97% recommend. The game has sold/is selling amazing even going as far as to break a record for PlayStation yet somehow the majority opinion on Reddit is that it's an objectively bad game and a terrible disappointment.
Some people have ample community in their lives, some don’t. Some who don’t seek community online. Those that don’t have ample community tend to get their opinions on world event from mass media which usually has a particular way of looking at things. Harry Potter = bad now being one of those opinions.
Eh, suicide squad is getting dragged through the coals on social media too. With that being said, your average gamer is still not going to care about that - just that the product is fun. I do really hope the "live service" is actually good though, because if it's not then it doesn't matter what IP you have - just look at the Avengers.
    I’m honestly just keen to play the base game as is. Truth be told, free content is cool and all but I’ll probably move on to something else by then. But the gameplay looks addicting so who knows? 

The only live service that hooks me is multiplayer. I’m not sure why? Maybe there’s more FOMO that way
World of Warcraft has been dead/dying for almost 20 years now, almost any mmorpg discussion on reddit someone sais it and gets agreed with despite it routinely putting up some of the best numbers
    Their number of players are nowhere near where they were before, that's just a fact. Now their revenue on the other hand, with all the added microtransactions, that's probably keeping increasing.
    Ifs definitely just limping on at this point. The numbers are nowhere at all what they used to be.
It's the same with Palworld. Most people on Twitter and Reddit *hate* it with a fiery passion, but the actual sales are insanely high for such a new gaming company. Everyone irl just views it as Pokémon with guns and thinks it's decent, meanwhile my twitter feed has been people bashing it constantly as a failure since it released.
    The Palworld discourse is really funny to watch, people were claiming that the sales are totally normal and expected when an indie game is beating out most AAA games with marketing budgets of 100+ million. Also if the game was so bad and unfinished it wouldn't have 94% out of 150k reviews on Steam.
Come on, let's be honest, if this wasn't a harry Potter game we wouldn't come close to these numbers. The casual crowd wants to roleplay harry potter, even if it's a mediocre game. They see that Hogwarts castle and shit themselves in joy and that's it
Well that sounds unreasonable tbh. The quality and achievements of The Witcher 3 are well known amongst anyone even remotely interested in video games. Even if you don't personally like it (I sure don't) you should be able to see why it is so highly regarded as one of the all time greats. 

As with anything, enthusiasts of any hobby tend to have a slightly warped view of the reality the activity. By indulging in online discussions about games you naturally distance yourself from the average joe, whose interaction with games doesn't go beyond playing half an hour of Tekken once a week. That is okay, but you have to be aware of it. 

By accusing everyone of lying, you come off as incredibly close minded, like everyone is wrong and you are right. That is not the case. 
Taking everything as fabricated lies is no better than taking any garbage opinion as absolute fact. The truth lies somewhere in the middle.
Kids? Bro it's millennials. The nostalgia is big. 
    Yeah lmao. Harry Potter fans are like 30 years old now. They aren't kids anymore haha
        Not really true. My nephew (10 y/o) just came out of her Elsa phase and jumped straight into Hermione mood. At the end of the day is quite a natural passage if you are looking for someone to identify with
            It also makes sense since a lot of people who grew up with it are probably reading harry potter to their own kids now.
        The original Harry Potter kids have pre-teens now that are getting into it
    Of course, but kids enjoy it a lot as well. Pokémon started off with millennials, but most kids in my family like it too, for example.
> The PS5 exclusive quest was literally the best quest in the entire game.

I'd argue that the side quest with that Slytherin boy could be a contender for best quest along side that one.  I enjoyed that it didn't have a happy ending, rather, it left me sad.
    I love Sebastian's questline, story, and character. It brought more greyness into the world of Harry Potter, making Slytherins look not as evil or cowardly.
Perfect for patientgamers like myself! Can’t wait to play this in a year or so. Now I am delving in Guardians of the Galaxy and I am in awe how great it is!
    Damn i'm doing thr same thing. I'm playing Guardians right now and i'll wait for Hogwarts when everything will be in it.
"later this summer" but if you have the pc version you can turn it on with mods.
You love to see it
    Why yes
[removed]
    Honestly I enjoyed that sub before the entire HL disaster. There was some good jokes and good commentary. Not anymore lol
    Am I missing something? I thought it was a shit posting sub. Are you saying they're being serious?
This writer is terrible, clearly has an agenda and is categorically false. Wired is officially shit
I don't care about this game at all but this is completely embarrassing. 
This is hilarious in the context of the games commercial success, but furthermore, it is comically false in its commentary also. I skimmed through it, and especially when it says home isn't home anymore and it's divorced from the book descriptions I had to comment just to say the castle in Hogwarts Legacy is one of the most detailed and exquisite representations of any place in the entire history of representing books in other forms of media
GCJ in a nutshell.
I saw dudes acting like they were saving gaming itself by buying copies.
I mean, the first mistake was listening to Jimquisition in the first place. Her and MovieBob are really two of the worst online reviewers that are still around, and it's hard to understand why at this point, since they're both just bitter, hateful pieces of shit.
    Yeah I sadly agree. I used to quite enjoy her content, but now it seems like EVERYTHING has to be negative, there's always something to complain about or someone to blame for something. I get it, negativity drives views. But it just feels so constant now, and delivered in such a smug, self congratulating way. (Doesn't help that from what I recall she screwed over her editor in terms of paying him and having him live with her, then accusing him of making her relive trauma when he asked for a raise)
She was right
    I saw a Youtube short from a trans woman who said the same thing, but then the comments were full of trans people saying she was wrong and that they were loving the game. So I don't think the blanket statement really works.
    [deleted]
        thats a weird take, she will still get the money. doesnt really matter if you buy on sale or not. just play the game if you want to and reclaim the harry potter universe from her, or dont. the game is really diverse, there are trans characters and whatever. the developers definitely deserve the money, first part of the game was glorious und made with so much love for Hogwarts.
        You seriously cannot be this stupid.
        How is JK Rowling far right?
            It looks like if someone doesn't agree with the far-left even on one thing, they are far-right. It doesn't matter if everything else they believe in is left.
                I guess, lol
They hated him, for he told them the truth.
C) cis people doing things on behalf of trans people.
The genius classic move of;

>"Hmmm these people are all on the fence about an issue"

>"I will spray them all with a firehose of hate and names to get them to come to my side!"

>"Wait why did they go to the other side?"

That's quite literally the entire boycott, gj on pushing people to disagree with you 👍
yes, it raised awareness that the game exists, so even more people bought it, good job!
Yes it was such a great idea to bully and threaten people for your “awareness”. Go touch some grass.
To be fair, wasn't that sale price like $4 off?
    Yeah, it was just a typical Steam launch sale.
There are also many gamers from countries either terrible exchange rates who can’t afford the game with its full price.  Sales helped many in mine currently.
Yea, that's like saying, "how come nobody is talking about the new fifa game even though it sold so many copies".

There would be nothing of note to talk about even without the controversy. The people that like it, played it and moved on.
When it was released this sub had a specific rule banning any and all discussion - this was for months and only seems to have gone away relatively recently. 

You could be banned for even bringing the game up when it released.  Which was bizarre - it was and still is the most popular game of the year and this place banned discussion on it.
You spent $60 on a video game to spite people you don’t know on the internet, who don’t know you, and who also don’t know you bought the game? 

Yeah you showed them……
Really? Did really buy a game just to one up some random nobody's on internet.
You are a very sad individual.
Well what's important is that you continue to loudly express your contempt of Trans people as they are legislated back into the shadows. Good for you! Very brave, to play a video game. My hero!
    Wasn't there a trans character in the game? Not many games that can boast that.

        Doesn't really make up for the fake that JKR is actively against the existence of trans people.
            She's not even involved with the development of the game though.

And in what way is she?
                -writing a book about a man dressing up as a woman to kill women.
-thinks trans women are all rapists and pedophiles trying to groom children.
-thinks all trans men are confused autistic lesbians.

I could list more but I'd go over any character limits, but yes she does actively state these opinions and encourages others to harass trans people.
                    Oh man, you’d hate to hear about a little movie called “Psycho”….
                    Any sources to back this up? I know about the book already.
                        [Here 's](https://www.vox.com/culture/23622610/jk-rowling-transphobic-statements-timeline-history-controversy) an article on the more overtly transphobic things she's done.

For a more nuanced look on the subtle ways JKR's bigotry operates I'd recommend [ContraPoints's video](https://youtu.be/7gDKbT_l2us) on the subject.
                        It's very public, and I know twitter isn't exactly a source but it's not like it's a medical paper, you can go onto her twitter account and the whole thing will be filled with her opinions regarding trans people. JKR doesn't hide it.
                            Classic JKR hating thread 

> JKR wants trans people dead

> gets asked for examples

> "go educate yourself"

> <insert literally any rebuttal>

> "you transphobic fuck"
                            The point is you can’t actually back it up. Again you’re parroting other people’s nonsense.
                        Here's a good [TIMES article about JK.](https://time.com/5855633/jk-rowling-gender-identity/)
                    All of this is utter drivel. Step outside your bubble and actually read her words.
            What did she say that's against the existence of trans people?
            She’s not at all. You’re misinformed or knowingly spreading BS. Don’t believe rubbish other people are telling you. Actually read what she’s said.
                I have read exactly what she's said and yes she is transphobic.
Story was very average but damn I loved Hogsmead in the fall.  Beautiful scenery!
The world was boring, hogwarts was amazing. A good to go game.
Yeah, my only gripe is how they don't let you unlock perks until you finish the first act. The combat really gets great after you unlock the ability to do that diving dodge.
> Flying was solid. Combat was very good. Exploring Hogwarts and finding secrets was excellent.

I feel like I feel the polar opposite on all of these points...

Traversal in general was a slog, and game performance made it worse. It got better toward the end as you unlocked faster flying and more flying modes, but anything that required traversal like races, *balloon popping (urgh)* was all just... a chore.

Combat was incredibly boring, and only a step above combat I'd expect to see in a lego game. Memorize one combo, and it can carry you throughout the entire game. Even on the hardest difficulties, it's far too easy and has no depth at all. Which isn't helped by the pitiful array of magic available to you... It's literally game *about magic.* In my playthrough I had to quit the game and start again on the hardest difficulty because I was just breezing through everything. There is no challenge at any point during the game.

Exploring hogwarts *was* great, because the world design is stellar, but the items, puzzles, and challenges you find in those exploring phases are just... awful. These are the sorts of puzzles you show to babies to help them learn spatial reasoning... There are so many of them as well, which is great... *as long as they don't have like 6 variants...* It's an absolute chore working through all of them. And most of the gear is uninspired palette swaps that just screams the design choices made when making this game. I.e, they only had a tiny amount of actual content, and had to stretch it over this massive game. They're beating a dead hippogryph.
    And with these downvotes lies the terrible gaming truth, casuals rule the world.
        Downvotes because he's objectively wrong about combat. A single pattern of spells absolutely will not get you through the game because of resistances/armor, attack patterns, etc.
            Actually i got carried the entire game by using whatever single patern of spells were available. I have no shame in saying i just spammed whatever was the without a cooldown. At best you just have to look out for when to dodge some very telegraphed attacks and parries and maybe remove a shield with a color spell to match, because often you can just yeet stuff at enemies to break shields.

The game remains absolutely mediocre though
Flying was very awkward on a keyboard. That and the puppy mill aspect of breast breeding made me lose interest in the game. 

I probably should redo the key binds to match wow flying or invest in a controller and finish the game.
Oh yea, build aspect was SUPER weak
Maybe you misunderstood me with the quality comment or are you just saying that in general?

When I say it was so simple I’m saying the gameplay loop is easy to understand, it’s not difficult like a souls, it’s just right for an average audience which helps draw in Harry Potter fans, that definitely helps with sales because it keeps selling, if it was insanely difficult or hard to play for the average user it wouldn’t have a good word of mouth recommendation
Doesn’t that prove it doesn’t matter?
    Yes? Idk what point you think I was making. The guy is claiming that woke people are losing and that "the tides are changing" meanwhile much of what is popular could be considered woke by any of the vague descriptions "anti-woke" people use.


I wouldn't consider widespread mainstream success to be an indication that they're losing this culture war.
[removed]
    My point is that a "woke" game won GOTY. Another woke game (Spider-Man 2) was nominated for GOTY and was highly successful. TOTK is arguably woke as well given Nintendo deliberately made Link more feminine to appeal to female gamers. 


So, again, it sounds like you're coping.
What's wokeism?
    Anything conservatives don’t like.
        [removed]
            "Conservative" as a term is not restricted to the US.
What's the problem? He did use the term correctly here.
Fuck im sick of hearing people yell about how everything is woke. Gotta be the dumbest people on the planet.
Wow, bunch of manbabies downvoted you huh? <3
The people complaining went about it the wrong way, horrible harassing the hell out of people for simply playing a game, as a result the whole movement was and it's still looked at with disdain.
    some of the people went about their complaints the wrong way. it's bad but ultimately it's not relevant to the stated issue. to bring that up is changing the subject tbh.
the thing is. I dont give a fuck
If she was racist I wouldn’t think differently. I consume media that I don’t consider to be problematic. I don’t care who made it, as long as the media doesn’t promote hate.
    but... the money you gave her... is used to promote hate. what dont you get about that?
        Whether she got money from the game or not, it doesn’t matter. She will still have a Twitter account into the foreseeable future, even if all her projects fail…

If I played the game, how does that promote hate against trans people? She gets money? And? Her main method of spreading hate isn’t money based… 

She isn’t an elected official either, so it’s not like she can pass anti-trans bills. Unless there’s some lobbying she’s done to push anti trans laws I don’t know of? Not like she can run out of money doing that considering she’s a billionaire…
        I seperate art from the artist. If it’s good art it should be paid for. I pirated Hogwarts Legacy.
            why do you separate the art from the artist? the artist sometimes uses their money they got from making art for non-art things. that's important to think about.
                It’s important to you. Not to me.
                    but you just said you wouldnt buy a game that promotes hate. but youd buy a game whose payment goes to promote hate, simply because it's within the realm of "the artist" and not within the fiction of the product you bought. very inconsistent. is it possible you just dont want to have to think about the world critically in this way?
                        I don’t like hate so I don’t consume it, it’s perfectly consistent.
                            so as long as the hate doesnt affect your enjoyment of the media youre ok?
                    I like your attitude.

J.K. Rowling is a transphobe.
                Yeah, at this point anyone who argues that she isn't is showing their own colors.  It's widely known, it's not at all hidden, and there are *plenty* of people/sites that have done comprehensive discussions on the subject.

    That's a really weird thing to say about someone who would tell you straight up that she hates trans people lol.
        She never said that
            She would if you asked tho. Everything she's done and said demonstrates how much she hates trans people.
                No proof
Well, it's HP, but also WB put it on sale like two months after it launched and it continued to see frequent and significant sales throughout last year. It was 50% off for weeks throughout the holidays. They were desperately trying to make it the best selling game of the year.
24million sales for a no big tech company is hype? I know it doesn't seem a lot but it's the first game that beat fifa in the UK selling charts. Yeah agreed it sells well cause HP but it does have a lot of hype and attention as without that HP link it's bang average
    Hype was just around that time. You literally did not hear about it after that initial month. So the hype was about harry potter universe, not the game...
I have GP so anything I really fancy that I don't own gets priority which can be annoying when you wanna finish some of your backlog games. Far cry 6 is a massive game, finished the story last night after playing it since the release on GP, though will keep it installed to get a couple of achievements.

See I would be jumping on AC Val but they did a one day sales when it was like 17.99 for the complete edition. Might try some smaller games till Tuesday, see whats coming onto GP in the new list
It was too mid to ever win an award even if JK wasn’t a transphobe
It’s not recency bias. Games don’t get nominations just because of sales.
Indeed

Harry Potter game I expected and was promised and Harry Potter game I did get. 

Cant say the same about other games of other famous IP's. People are still waiting for good Avengers or DC.

And this game being a bit "simple" makes it much easier for people who are not into gaming actually buying this game just because they want to experience the Wizarding world.

And if you ask me a sequel can ONLY improve on what they did here.
    Crazy to think that the best marvel videogame to date was made by the Lego team.
        Yeah it is a great shame 

I did enjoy the Midnight Suns game. Customizing your hero and making your deck for them. It was also fun to have so many heroes working together and interacting.
            I’m so disappointed that this game didn’t catch on 

It was far from perfect but I had a lot of fun playing it
            im still waiting midnight sun -75 with all dlc
            I hope they don't feel discouraged by sales. I'd love a midnight suns sequel.
                I would like it as well.

With more customization options and maybe actual relationships with other heroes. And also more impactful choices because the dark and light didn't matter in my opinion when it comes to the story. Also more diverse missions and not just Hydra and those monster enemies.
                    My only gripe is I hate hate hated the character you play as. I’d rather play as one of the cool, interesting Marvel characters than generic hero B.
                        I don't mind it. 

I just wish our choices could shape our hero better and have more range of customization when it comes to our abilities. 

Like, let's say Strange could show you how to cast some spells pushing you to be more magic-oriented. Or training with Cap and Carol to be more melee and physically oriented. 

That alone would make our hero better and more connected to the world.
                An X-men game in this style could be absolutely amazing!
        Huh... Spider-Man is a Marvel game?
            Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man, yes.
            Disney doesn't even make marvel games. They in fact disolved lucasarts games. 😮‍💨

We have sony and their insomniac to thank as well as Respawn for the Jedi games with Cal Kestis as the lead and even then they dropped the ball so hard on PC.
            That’s more Sony then marvel though tbh
                It is a still game within that fantasy world

It may not be a "Disney" game or an "MCU" game but it is absolutely a Marvel game
                Also Marvel fans have had Marvel Vs Capcom 3 and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games.

The Deadpool game isn't groundbreaking, but it wasn't terrible.

The Guardians Telltale game was great fun

The Guardians of the Galaxy game was good quality also

And there are another 5 Marvel Games on the way
        Guardians of the galaxy is a masterpiece. I usually dont like action games and I don't like Guardians, and I loved it.
        Marvel's midnight suns, the guardians of the galaxy, insomniac's spider-man are all great. I rarely finish games but finished all of these.
        Midnight Suns for me
        This makes it sound like the lego devs don't just make excellent games in general. They've also made some of the best star wars games ever IMO. 

Also there's been some good spidey games over the years and GotG was good.
            The only Star Wars games to ever top the LEGO ones are the old Kotor games and maybe the new Fallen Order/Survivor games (if you like Souls-esque gameplay that is). 

I enjoyed Rogue Squadron III quite a bit as a kid, but objectively speaking it was not that great of a game and I liked it as much as I did simply because the options available for Star Wars games were not great. There were also some niche successes in the MMO space, but neither Galaxies nor SWTOR really lasted all that long (yes, SWTOR technically still exists but not with any popularity really) in the grand scheme of things.
        Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy..
        I mean while we’re on the topic the best Harry Potter game was also made by Lego lol.
    Waiting for good DC? We forgetting the Arkham games?
    > And this game being a bit "simple" makes it much easier for people who are not into gaming actually buying this game just because they want to experience the Wizarding world.

This is the key that made the game so successful.

People did not buy this game for crazy and complex gameplay. They bought this game because they wanted to explore Hogwarts and the wizarding world that surrounds it. People wanted to play as a wizard and have fun checking out all the little details of a fantasy world they grew up reading.

Complex gameplay would make it harder to just pick up and wander to find all of the little pieces scattered throughout the game. It has exploration features galore though, which is exactly what this type of game (one meant for fans to explore an immersive world) needed.
    Exactly, me and my sister both bought this game, as we're both HP fans. Seeing as I play a lot of games, it was pretty easy, but I still really enjoyed it.


For my sister though it was perfect, as she mainly plays more laid back stuff like Animal Crossing.
    I’m playing this game alongside my daughter who has little gaming experience, and I think it’s just enough for her. It’s not too easy, but it’s challenging enough she might not beat a boss on her first try but try different strategies, and feel rewarded for her effort.
I'd rather just a good game, I've played many games off the ips I like. Rarley have I played a good game off of IPS I like

This game was just boring. Never completed. Kinda the worst insult for a game. That I just didn't want to play
To the game's credit however, the combat is actually quite well done -- it's responsive and there is some element of strategic depth with the different types of spells as well as specific creatures counters. Combat was one of the most consistently enjoyable aspects of the game for myself.
    Agreed.  I really enjoyed the combat and thought the final Rookwood confrontation was a ton of fun
    Sucks you had to remove all your gear if you wanted to keep experiencing it and not one shot everything
    I thought the combat was pretty boring as well. For me it felt like it was mostly spectacle and little substance. The feeling of impact was missing and it became too much 'pew pew pew'.

It was probably good enough to carry a game in which encounters are rare, but considering the game is filled to the brim with combat situations, I was done with it around the five hour mark.
I'm tired of "open world" games where there are the same things spread around the world.  Defeating some sort of "bad guy camp" 20 times gets old quick for me.  There is nothing unique about them.  Hogwarts, Spider-Man, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon, Infamous all have repetitive quests/areas like this.
    Yeah it's weird seeing people hate on this game, when a ton of other super well regarded games also have the same traits/issues.

I just finished Spiderman PS4 (well the PS5 version), and it is the definition of "basic-AF" open world game with collectibles and the same three or four side missions. But it's also a great Spiderman game that makes you feel like the webslinger so it's enjoyable.
        At least Spider-Man has excellent well-designed main missions. Hogwarts put lots of obvious filler right into the main campaign.
    I agree, except Hogwarts Legacy went way beyond 20 of something.  There are 95 Merlin trials.  There are 9 types, but they are all similar enough.
> They put everything into the design of hogwarts, and everything else was an afterthought.

That would be because first and foremost it was an exploration game. A way for people to adventure in the fantasy world they grew up reading, finding all the little things that were scattered throughout Hogwarts and the surrounding area.

It was not made to be an action title with complex and engaging combat, nor was it meant to be a dramatic epic with a cinematic storyline.
Definitely, they even had good broom flight mechanics already in place! Even just as a minigame it would have been great fun, definitely more so than some of the other minigames they did implement. 

I, too, spent far too many hours playing HP Quidditch World Cup but on Gamecube instead for me.
    Granted, the game mechanics of Quidditch are so shit that it's understandable why they wouldn't want to bring it back to public eye.

For the unfamiliar reading this comment, Quidditch's scoring system is terrible.  Imagine you're playing hockey, where you have 1 Goalie, a few defenders and a few shooters, a total of 6 players on the ice at any given time.   They're scoring and defending and just playing a normal game of hockey.  Then, add a 7th player to the each team who is completely disinterested with scoring or defending, who is off doing some difficult solo task.  The game is over when one of the team's 7th players completes their solo task.  The other 12 players scoring and defending only actually matter in the outcome in the game if one team scores 15 goals more than the other team.  

So for 90+% of games, what 12/14 players are doing makes absolutely no difference on the outcome of the game.

If Quidditch were to ever be put in a game again, I would recommend they just remove the Seeker/Golden Snitch component altogether and declare the game over after 1 hour.
        > If Quidditch were to ever be put in a game again, I would recommend they just remove the Seeker/Golden Snitch component altogether and declare the game over after 1 hour.

I think the real problem, more than the snitch, is the fact that people act like goals would be hard to score in Quidditch.

You're flying around at easily 60+ mph on brooms throwing a ball into one of 3 MASSIVE hoops, with 3 different dimensions of travel you can use to evade defenders and no restrictions on the use of your hands to control the game ball. In the books and movies they seem to describe scoring as if it were akin to soccer or hockey, with high-scoring affairs being rare. In reality it would be MUCH more similar to scoring in the NBA with each teams scoring multiple times every minute of gameplay. 

Anybody who thinks goals with a Quaffle would be any less frequent than field goals or 3-pointers in basketball is absolutely delusional.

That introduces the other problem though, which is that because scoring would be so frequent it begins to trivialize the snitch unless you can find it early enough in the game before the better combination of beaters and chasers have started to snowball their advantage. In reality the keepers would have a rather minimal effect on the game because you could just force the keeper to commit to defending one hoop and throw it instead into either of the other two hoops that was left completely open.
            That's true.  With how valuable the Snitch is, I wonder if teams would create 2-Seeker lineups, or maybe just abandon it altogether and play 0-Seeker lineups.
                I feel like a real-life quidditch would essentially just pull the keeper 100% of the time because a keeper would have little chance at actually stopping shots on goal for the reasons I outlined above. At best the keeper would play more like a defensive back in soccer, trying to quickly steal the ball from attacking chasers before they got to the goals and shuttle it back to their own offense.

As far as the seeker goes, that's a tough one. If you had good beaters and chasers then I would think you'd prioritize pulling the seeker as well to maximize your advantage when it comes to scoring the Quaffle as many times as possible. If your beaters and chasers were worse than the opponent's, however, then finding the snitch fast would be your top priority since it would be the only real chance for you to win.
                    Come to think of it, you have  people flying on brooms at 60 mph.  Once one team has the Quaffle, how easy would it be for them to keep it for themselves the whole game.  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.  Aren't they allowed to fly through a hoop instead of throwing it for easy points?
                        >  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.

The magical person-seeking missiles that are bludgers flying faster than you can go on a broom would be the main thing stopping that from happening. If you tried you just eventually get merced by a bowling ball which forces you to drop it.

It seems that after each goal is scored you have some kind of toss-up of the ball in the middle of the field to restart play, same as a face-off in hockey. Thus it doesn't really matter if you throw the ball or carry it through the hoop since you go back to the center face-off anyways once the goal has scored.
>NPC's should be killable. Deduct points to my house if I do shenanigans... don't bring me to a game over screen... wth. There should be real repercussions to what I do etc....

No one is making a game where you can murder a bunch of 11 year olds….
    r/prequelmemes: Hello there
    I mean Skyrim also didnt allow the murder of kids. Not saying you can kill Hogwart students but adult  non essential NPCs should be killable. 

I just want to Skyrimfy the shit out of this game.
        The world or hogwarts isn’t about just randomly killing people, that would add nothing to me.  
I don’t even think those unforgivable curses should even have been in the game, and certainly not with how casually they are treated.    

There are plenty of other was to make the world more reactive without turning a teenager in to a killer.
            > I don’t even think those unforgivable curses should even have been in the game, and certainly not with how casually they are treated.

I'd have been happier with the inclusion of unforgiveable curses if they came with consequences.

In the books and movies the ministry of magic can track every single spell ever cast by an underage wizard. They know full-well that some kid is going around Avada Kedavra-ing a bunch of trolls and goblins, but seemingly nobody cares about it.

Some sort of reputation system would have been a nice touch at least, with interactions with "good" characters becoming more negative the more you used unforgiveable curses and interactions with "evil" characters becoming more favorable and vice versa.
            I mean... my game of reference isn't also about randomly killing people as well. 

What I generally mean is NPC's should be part of the world and not just a pretty walking vase. 

For example, if I go unlock a house, the NPC inside shouldnt just be randomly sipping tea while I ransack their chest... either pummel me unconscious or run away and report me to school. 

If I throw an exploding spell recklessly... that random npc person should be accidentally blown to bits... 

Again not fully go Voldemort but just live in a reactive world. NPC's in this game right now are nothing but pretty decorations.

My initial example was too out there... but I think you know what I mean. We both want the same thing... just a living reactive world.
                Can you stop calling it skyrimify as if skyrim was anything more than your first example of a game like that rather than the creator or pinnacle of the type of game lol
                    Not everyone is going to have the same reference points for a given trope in media. Don't be so elitist.
I mean, I get your criticisms, but “I should be able to slaughter people in my Harry Potter game and bribe the prefects if I get in trouble” is actually an insane take.

I would be happy with the world reacting to me more, and some increased difficulty.
    Also, could you imagine anything more stupid than being caught murdering students and then getting points deducted from your house instead of going straight to Azkaban.
I think it was as complex as I want it to be... with the crafting, upgrading gear plus the rock-paper-scissors spell system that isn't just about damage/resist type but actually integrates physics and visuals (e.g. pulling them into range, then blasting them with short range spell). 

Not sure what gamers think is "top notch" here; does it need to have like 8 systems of inter-relating special items, special moves, special-er moves, gear/weapon art moves, pet/summon moves, co-op moves, environmentally-based moves, etc., to be happy with a third person action-adventure game?
    Complexity is often the enemy of fun. Some is good, but too many systems causes confusion. Better to have a few well-understood systems, with plenty of choices within those systems (e.g. different spells or different gear), rather than doubling the number of systems that players need to understand.
Would be great to have the same level of modding tools, that way the community could step in and fill the gaps. Because the team made it pretty clear that they aren’t doing any DLC or additional content.
    There’s some sort of update/announcement coming soon per a recent tweet so maybe they will end up changing their mind on DLC given the game’s success.

    It's an unreal game. So you can just make blueprint plugins in UE and throw them in the game.
Yea, if the dialog was better and the open world exploration had more unique and challenging content (way too many repeating merlin trials and caves), it would be a great game.
"Ever wonder if we've set the bar too high?"

First i would say, the only way the bar knows is up.

But in regards to HL the Story and dialog is just that: mediocre, that's not a bar set too high.
Id argue it was so successful because everyone set the bar so low for this one.


If it was a new IP with no association to Harry Potter it would of been forgotten within a month as another generic open world game.
Curious to know if you've played the game? Because idk how you could (without nostalgia goggles) say it was better than mediocre.
    I have played the game. I enjoyed it a lot, even as a non-fan of Harry Potter. I played it, completed it, and moved on.

The game has beautiful visuals and the gameplay was familiar and done well. The story left a little to be desired, but story is oftentimes the hardest part to excel at. 

It's clear that they put a lot more effort into the visuals and the verisimilitude of the game world than they did the story and RPG mechanics, but in no way did I feel like and of its pitfalls made the game any less than "good".
In today's gaming world, 6/10 tends to be given to subpar games (weirdly). I don't think this game is *that* bad. It's more of a "pretty good" not "good/great" game.

It looks great, plays well, and executes it's mechanics very well. It just isn't deep, unfortunately.
    On a scale that is used properly, 6/10 is accurate. On the scale that video game reviewers use, 6/10 basically means "completely unplayable trash", in that case, not an accurate description of HL.
    Yeah I think the main issue I had with it was the over hypedness of it. Lack RPG elements and any elements they did add, were basic.

The whole bottom portion of the map didn’t need to exist from a story perspective. Feels a lot like they took on more than they could handle.

Edit: personally don’t know if I want to replay it and I’m a big HP fan. A game like cyberpunk thought, I’m itching for a second play through.
Yea, that's mob mentality + honey moon phase for you
Not in a world where Spider-Man 2 gets GotY noms it isn't. If you want to say SM2 is also a 6/10, I'll agree. But as far as 3rd person open world adventure games goes HL was miles ahead of it.

I'm pretty sure it was for the GameBoy Color, and there were two. I also remember having fun with them! There was a lot of disappointment when I found that the GBA games weren't the same style.
I think the Harry Potter story was very good. Maybe I just love then so much cause I grew up reading and watching them I watched them everytime they aired on TV and in the game walking the halls with RTX On was just an nostalgic expirence the game's story could have been a  better I agree. The world of Harry Potter always makes you wanting more of it
    >The world of Harry Potter always makes you wanting more of it

The first Fantastic Beasts movie hit this itch super hard. At least where he's in his little zoo.
        Yesss seeing all the magical beasts makes you just fall in love with the world. And whenever just in a trailer while browsing a streaming service you hear the main theme and you instantly want to start watching that movie.
we can also extend this to....people who are upset are very vocal

people who don't care won't participate

twitter and reddit seem like they're always upset with everything because of this.

like even if I have a contrary opinion and I see a community of people all malding, I'm gonna scroll on by without commenting because I'd rather not get a bunch of reddit cares and angry DMs
The best way to stop enjoying a game is to be on the Reddit for it. If you were enjoying it you'll get brainwashed in the negativity and change your mind or just feel bad for enjoying it.

Current path of exile Reddit is slowly turning into a nice place once you've finished the mandatory 1-2 weeks of a league launch where everyone is beta testing the league for them.
    >The best way to stop enjoying a game is to be on the Reddit for it. 

I enjoy browsing r/SatisfactoryGame.

It seems like the more niche the game, the more wholesome the community is. Purely anecdotal since idk about the other communities i don't take part in.
        This is always true in my experience. I blame the fact that popularity brings kids into communities but it could be just cope for people being people
        The same is true for DRG. one of the best gaming communities. ROCK AND STONE!
        Same with factorio.. no time to argue when THE FACTORY MUST GROW!!!
        This really does depend. The battle brothers subreddit is really good if you want end game advice. It's fucking trash if you're starting out because every other post is "trash bro, dump him, you'll never do the end game locations that are only meant for the hardcore players with that bro". 

Which is funny in itself because there are people who have cleared that location with average bro's.
    I mean I'm on subreddits for games I love the community is very harsh of and it's never once made me dislike a game. I enjoy playing the game. Everything outside of me enjoying the game has no impact on my enjoyment. And if I don't enjoy the game then no matter how much people sing it's praises I won't play it since I don't enjoy it. Basically just play like you what even if everyone you see and hear is saying it's trash. I'll enjoy living in my dump then.
        Yep. Other people don’t change my enjoyment.
    The rimworld sub is surprisingly wholesome considering what the game is
    Depends on the game. Joining r/warthunder brought me peace knowing I'm not the only one being dragged through the mud every day
    It also removes the enjoyment of figuring out a game for yourself. Take Palworld as an example, its way more fun to run around aimlessly and feel the surprise/excitement of stumbling across a rare pal or a new boss or something rather than reddit telling me which dudes are worth leveling/where to get them and which dudes should stay in the palbox.

> This makes sense because Reddit consists of the hardcore player base of a game

It's even more disconnected than that.

Reddit usually consists of a subgroup. Yes, more 'hardcore' players, but still not a general reflection of the 'hardcore' playerbase, they're a mix of 'hardcore', 'nerds', primarily pc players rather than console, and permanently online. 

It's a niche inside a niche. (Like almost everywhere on the internet)
The other thing to consider is that, of the "hardcore" players, like in all aspects of life, most are just chilling and not commenting positive/negatively. The vocal minority is a sliver *of a sliver.*
I don't think this is a correct assumption. At best you can say that the reddit portion of a games population is the population that uses reddit.
    Don’t care
Reddit also thought it was unfathomable let alone impossible for somebody like Trump to win presidency, but here we are. I never liked Trump and never voted for him, but I constantly got called a Trump supporter because I told people to vote and be wary of him.

I promise you those same idiots will still tell me I’m wrong and downvote me here too. Mostly because they still exist here and are still disillusioned.
I’m honestly just keen to play the base game as is. Truth be told, free content is cool and all but I’ll probably move on to something else by then. But the gameplay looks addicting so who knows? 

The only live service that hooks me is multiplayer. I’m not sure why? Maybe there’s more FOMO that way
Their number of players are nowhere near where they were before, that's just a fact. Now their revenue on the other hand, with all the added microtransactions, that's probably keeping increasing.
Ifs definitely just limping on at this point. The numbers are nowhere at all what they used to be.
The Palworld discourse is really funny to watch, people were claiming that the sales are totally normal and expected when an indie game is beating out most AAA games with marketing budgets of 100+ million. Also if the game was so bad and unfinished it wouldn't have 94% out of 150k reviews on Steam.
Yeah lmao. Harry Potter fans are like 30 years old now. They aren't kids anymore haha
    Not really true. My nephew (10 y/o) just came out of her Elsa phase and jumped straight into Hermione mood. At the end of the day is quite a natural passage if you are looking for someone to identify with
        It also makes sense since a lot of people who grew up with it are probably reading harry potter to their own kids now.
    The original Harry Potter kids have pre-teens now that are getting into it
Of course, but kids enjoy it a lot as well. Pokémon started off with millennials, but most kids in my family like it too, for example.
I love Sebastian's questline, story, and character. It brought more greyness into the world of Harry Potter, making Slytherins look not as evil or cowardly.
Damn i'm doing thr same thing. I'm playing Guardians right now and i'll wait for Hogwarts when everything will be in it.
Why yes
Honestly I enjoyed that sub before the entire HL disaster. There was some good jokes and good commentary. Not anymore lol
Am I missing something? I thought it was a shit posting sub. Are you saying they're being serious?
Yeah I sadly agree. I used to quite enjoy her content, but now it seems like EVERYTHING has to be negative, there's always something to complain about or someone to blame for something. I get it, negativity drives views. But it just feels so constant now, and delivered in such a smug, self congratulating way. (Doesn't help that from what I recall she screwed over her editor in terms of paying him and having him live with her, then accusing him of making her relive trauma when he asked for a raise)
I saw a Youtube short from a trans woman who said the same thing, but then the comments were full of trans people saying she was wrong and that they were loving the game. So I don't think the blanket statement really works.
[deleted]
    thats a weird take, she will still get the money. doesnt really matter if you buy on sale or not. just play the game if you want to and reclaim the harry potter universe from her, or dont. the game is really diverse, there are trans characters and whatever. the developers definitely deserve the money, first part of the game was glorious und made with so much love for Hogwarts.
    You seriously cannot be this stupid.
    How is JK Rowling far right?
        It looks like if someone doesn't agree with the far-left even on one thing, they are far-right. It doesn't matter if everything else they believe in is left.
            I guess, lol
Yeah, it was just a typical Steam launch sale.
Wasn't there a trans character in the game? Not many games that can boast that.
    [There's a fair few.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_with_LGBT_characters)
    Doesn't really make up for the fake that JKR is actively against the existence of trans people.
        She's not even involved with the development of the game though.

And in what way is she?
            -writing a book about a man dressing up as a woman to kill women.
-thinks trans women are all rapists and pedophiles trying to groom children.
-thinks all trans men are confused autistic lesbians.

I could list more but I'd go over any character limits, but yes she does actively state these opinions and encourages others to harass trans people.
                Oh man, you’d hate to hear about a little movie called “Psycho”….
                Any sources to back this up? I know about the book already.
                    [Here 's](https://www.vox.com/culture/23622610/jk-rowling-transphobic-statements-timeline-history-controversy) an article on the more overtly transphobic things she's done.

For a more nuanced look on the subtle ways JKR's bigotry operates I'd recommend [ContraPoints's video](https://youtu.be/7gDKbT_l2us) on the subject.
                    It's very public, and I know twitter isn't exactly a source but it's not like it's a medical paper, you can go onto her twitter account and the whole thing will be filled with her opinions regarding trans people. JKR doesn't hide it.
                        Classic JKR hating thread 

> JKR wants trans people dead

> gets asked for examples

> "go educate yourself"

> <insert literally any rebuttal>

> "you transphobic fuck"
                        The point is you can’t actually back it up. Again you’re parroting other people’s nonsense.
                    Here's a good [TIMES article about JK.](https://time.com/5855633/jk-rowling-gender-identity/)
                All of this is utter drivel. Step outside your bubble and actually read her words.
        What did she say that's against the existence of trans people?
        She’s not at all. You’re misinformed or knowingly spreading BS. Don’t believe rubbish other people are telling you. Actually read what she’s said.
            I have read exactly what she's said and yes she is transphobic.
And with these downvotes lies the terrible gaming truth, casuals rule the world.
    Downvotes because he's objectively wrong about combat. A single pattern of spells absolutely will not get you through the game because of resistances/armor, attack patterns, etc.
        Actually i got carried the entire game by using whatever single patern of spells were available. I have no shame in saying i just spammed whatever was the without a cooldown. At best you just have to look out for when to dodge some very telegraphed attacks and parries and maybe remove a shield with a color spell to match, because often you can just yeet stuff at enemies to break shields.

The game remains absolutely mediocre though
Yes? Idk what point you think I was making. The guy is claiming that woke people are losing and that "the tides are changing" meanwhile much of what is popular could be considered woke by any of the vague descriptions "anti-woke" people use.


I wouldn't consider widespread mainstream success to be an indication that they're losing this culture war.
My point is that a "woke" game won GOTY. Another woke game (Spider-Man 2) was nominated for GOTY and was highly successful. TOTK is arguably woke as well given Nintendo deliberately made Link more feminine to appeal to female gamers. 


So, again, it sounds like you're coping.

        "Conservative" as a term is not restricted to the US.
some of the people went about their complaints the wrong way. it's bad but ultimately it's not relevant to the stated issue. to bring that up is changing the subject tbh.
but... the money you gave her... is used to promote hate. what dont you get about that?
    Whether she got money from the game or not, it doesn’t matter. She will still have a Twitter account into the foreseeable future, even if all her projects fail…

If I played the game, how does that promote hate against trans people? She gets money? And? Her main method of spreading hate isn’t money based… 

She isn’t an elected official either, so it’s not like she can pass anti-trans bills. Unless there’s some lobbying she’s done to push anti trans laws I don’t know of? Not like she can run out of money doing that considering she’s a billionaire…
    I seperate art from the artist. If it’s good art it should be paid for. I pirated Hogwarts Legacy.
        why do you separate the art from the artist? the artist sometimes uses their money they got from making art for non-art things. that's important to think about.
            It’s important to you. Not to me.
                but you just said you wouldnt buy a game that promotes hate. but youd buy a game whose payment goes to promote hate, simply because it's within the realm of "the artist" and not within the fiction of the product you bought. very inconsistent. is it possible you just dont want to have to think about the world critically in this way?
                    I don’t like hate so I don’t consume it, it’s perfectly consistent.
                        so as long as the hate doesnt affect your enjoyment of the media youre ok?
                I like your attitude.

J.K. Rowling is a transphobe.
            Yeah, at this point anyone who argues that she isn't is showing their own colors.  It's widely known, it's not at all hidden, and there are *plenty* of people/sites that have done comprehensive discussions on the subject.

That's a really weird thing to say about someone who would tell you straight up that she hates trans people lol.
    She never said that
        She would if you asked tho. Everything she's done and said demonstrates how much she hates trans people.
            No proof
Hype was just around that time. You literally did not hear about it after that initial month. So the hype was about harry potter universe, not the game...
Crazy to think that the best marvel videogame to date was made by the Lego team.
    Yeah it is a great shame 

I did enjoy the Midnight Suns game. Customizing your hero and making your deck for them. It was also fun to have so many heroes working together and interacting.
        I’m so disappointed that this game didn’t catch on 

It was far from perfect but I had a lot of fun playing it
        im still waiting midnight sun -75 with all dlc
        I hope they don't feel discouraged by sales. I'd love a midnight suns sequel.
            I would like it as well.

With more customization options and maybe actual relationships with other heroes. And also more impactful choices because the dark and light didn't matter in my opinion when it comes to the story. Also more diverse missions and not just Hydra and those monster enemies.
                My only gripe is I hate hate hated the character you play as. I’d rather play as one of the cool, interesting Marvel characters than generic hero B.
                    I don't mind it. 

I just wish our choices could shape our hero better and have more range of customization when it comes to our abilities. 

Like, let's say Strange could show you how to cast some spells pushing you to be more magic-oriented. Or training with Cap and Carol to be more melee and physically oriented. 

That alone would make our hero better and more connected to the world.
            An X-men game in this style could be absolutely amazing!
    Huh... Spider-Man is a Marvel game?
        Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man, yes.
        Disney doesn't even make marvel games. They in fact disolved lucasarts games. 😮‍💨

We have sony and their insomniac to thank as well as Respawn for the Jedi games with Cal Kestis as the lead and even then they dropped the ball so hard on PC.
        That’s more Sony then marvel though tbh
            It is a still game within that fantasy world

It may not be a "Disney" game or an "MCU" game but it is absolutely a Marvel game
            Also Marvel fans have had Marvel Vs Capcom 3 and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games.

The Deadpool game isn't groundbreaking, but it wasn't terrible.

The Guardians Telltale game was great fun

The Guardians of the Galaxy game was good quality also

And there are another 5 Marvel Games on the way
    Guardians of the galaxy is a masterpiece. I usually dont like action games and I don't like Guardians, and I loved it.
    Marvel's midnight suns, the guardians of the galaxy, insomniac's spider-man are all great. I rarely finish games but finished all of these.
    Midnight Suns for me
    This makes it sound like the lego devs don't just make excellent games in general. They've also made some of the best star wars games ever IMO. 

Also there's been some good spidey games over the years and GotG was good.
        The only Star Wars games to ever top the LEGO ones are the old Kotor games and maybe the new Fallen Order/Survivor games (if you like Souls-esque gameplay that is). 

I enjoyed Rogue Squadron III quite a bit as a kid, but objectively speaking it was not that great of a game and I liked it as much as I did simply because the options available for Star Wars games were not great. There were also some niche successes in the MMO space, but neither Galaxies nor SWTOR really lasted all that long (yes, SWTOR technically still exists but not with any popularity really) in the grand scheme of things.
    Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy..
    I mean while we’re on the topic the best Harry Potter game was also made by Lego lol.
Waiting for good DC? We forgetting the Arkham games?
> And this game being a bit "simple" makes it much easier for people who are not into gaming actually buying this game just because they want to experience the Wizarding world.

This is the key that made the game so successful.

People did not buy this game for crazy and complex gameplay. They bought this game because they wanted to explore Hogwarts and the wizarding world that surrounds it. People wanted to play as a wizard and have fun checking out all the little details of a fantasy world they grew up reading.

Complex gameplay would make it harder to just pick up and wander to find all of the little pieces scattered throughout the game. It has exploration features galore though, which is exactly what this type of game (one meant for fans to explore an immersive world) needed.
Exactly, me and my sister both bought this game, as we're both HP fans. Seeing as I play a lot of games, it was pretty easy, but I still really enjoyed it.


For my sister though it was perfect, as she mainly plays more laid back stuff like Animal Crossing.
I’m playing this game alongside my daughter who has little gaming experience, and I think it’s just enough for her. It’s not too easy, but it’s challenging enough she might not beat a boss on her first try but try different strategies, and feel rewarded for her effort.
Agreed.  I really enjoyed the combat and thought the final Rookwood confrontation was a ton of fun
Sucks you had to remove all your gear if you wanted to keep experiencing it and not one shot everything
I thought the combat was pretty boring as well. For me it felt like it was mostly spectacle and little substance. The feeling of impact was missing and it became too much 'pew pew pew'.

It was probably good enough to carry a game in which encounters are rare, but considering the game is filled to the brim with combat situations, I was done with it around the five hour mark.
Yeah it's weird seeing people hate on this game, when a ton of other super well regarded games also have the same traits/issues.

I just finished Spiderman PS4 (well the PS5 version), and it is the definition of "basic-AF" open world game with collectibles and the same three or four side missions. But it's also a great Spiderman game that makes you feel like the webslinger so it's enjoyable.
    At least Spider-Man has excellent well-designed main missions. Hogwarts put lots of obvious filler right into the main campaign.
I agree, except Hogwarts Legacy went way beyond 20 of something.  There are 95 Merlin trials.  There are 9 types, but they are all similar enough.
Granted, the game mechanics of Quidditch are so shit that it's understandable why they wouldn't want to bring it back to public eye.

For the unfamiliar reading this comment, Quidditch's scoring system is terrible.  Imagine you're playing hockey, where you have 1 Goalie, a few defenders and a few shooters, a total of 6 players on the ice at any given time.   They're scoring and defending and just playing a normal game of hockey.  Then, add a 7th player to the each team who is completely disinterested with scoring or defending, who is off doing some difficult solo task.  The game is over when one of the team's 7th players completes their solo task.  The other 12 players scoring and defending only actually matter in the outcome in the game if one team scores 15 goals more than the other team.  

So for 90+% of games, what 12/14 players are doing makes absolutely no difference on the outcome of the game.

If Quidditch were to ever be put in a game again, I would recommend they just remove the Seeker/Golden Snitch component altogether and declare the game over after 1 hour.
    > If Quidditch were to ever be put in a game again, I would recommend they just remove the Seeker/Golden Snitch component altogether and declare the game over after 1 hour.

I think the real problem, more than the snitch, is the fact that people act like goals would be hard to score in Quidditch.

You're flying around at easily 60+ mph on brooms throwing a ball into one of 3 MASSIVE hoops, with 3 different dimensions of travel you can use to evade defenders and no restrictions on the use of your hands to control the game ball. In the books and movies they seem to describe scoring as if it were akin to soccer or hockey, with high-scoring affairs being rare. In reality it would be MUCH more similar to scoring in the NBA with each teams scoring multiple times every minute of gameplay. 

Anybody who thinks goals with a Quaffle would be any less frequent than field goals or 3-pointers in basketball is absolutely delusional.

That introduces the other problem though, which is that because scoring would be so frequent it begins to trivialize the snitch unless you can find it early enough in the game before the better combination of beaters and chasers have started to snowball their advantage. In reality the keepers would have a rather minimal effect on the game because you could just force the keeper to commit to defending one hoop and throw it instead into either of the other two hoops that was left completely open.
        That's true.  With how valuable the Snitch is, I wonder if teams would create 2-Seeker lineups, or maybe just abandon it altogether and play 0-Seeker lineups.
            I feel like a real-life quidditch would essentially just pull the keeper 100% of the time because a keeper would have little chance at actually stopping shots on goal for the reasons I outlined above. At best the keeper would play more like a defensive back in soccer, trying to quickly steal the ball from attacking chasers before they got to the goals and shuttle it back to their own offense.

As far as the seeker goes, that's a tough one. If you had good beaters and chasers then I would think you'd prioritize pulling the seeker as well to maximize your advantage when it comes to scoring the Quaffle as many times as possible. If your beaters and chasers were worse than the opponent's, however, then finding the snitch fast would be your top priority since it would be the only real chance for you to win.
                Come to think of it, you have  people flying on brooms at 60 mph.  Once one team has the Quaffle, how easy would it be for them to keep it for themselves the whole game.  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.  Aren't they allowed to fly through a hoop instead of throwing it for easy points?
                    >  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.

The magical person-seeking missiles that are bludgers flying faster than you can go on a broom would be the main thing stopping that from happening. If you tried you just eventually get merced by a bowling ball which forces you to drop it.

It seems that after each goal is scored you have some kind of toss-up of the ball in the middle of the field to restart play, same as a face-off in hockey. Thus it doesn't really matter if you throw the ball or carry it through the hoop since you go back to the center face-off anyways once the goal has scored.
LMAO. Or just get a full wanted rating and have an army of aurors descend on you.
    Would be pretty sick if every game was similar to GTA. Harry Potter GTA? Pokémon GTA? Marvel and DC GTA? Dragon ball Z and Naruto GTA? GTA GTA? Lol

r/prequelmemes: Hello there
I mean Skyrim also didnt allow the murder of kids. Not saying you can kill Hogwart students but adult  non essential NPCs should be killable. 

I just want to Skyrimfy the shit out of this game.
    The world or hogwarts isn’t about just randomly killing people, that would add nothing to me.  
I don’t even think those unforgivable curses should even have been in the game, and certainly not with how casually they are treated.    

There are plenty of other was to make the world more reactive without turning a teenager in to a killer.
        > I don’t even think those unforgivable curses should even have been in the game, and certainly not with how casually they are treated.

I'd have been happier with the inclusion of unforgiveable curses if they came with consequences.

In the books and movies the ministry of magic can track every single spell ever cast by an underage wizard. They know full-well that some kid is going around Avada Kedavra-ing a bunch of trolls and goblins, but seemingly nobody cares about it.

Some sort of reputation system would have been a nice touch at least, with interactions with "good" characters becoming more negative the more you used unforgiveable curses and interactions with "evil" characters becoming more favorable and vice versa.
        I mean... my game of reference isn't also about randomly killing people as well. 

What I generally mean is NPC's should be part of the world and not just a pretty walking vase. 

For example, if I go unlock a house, the NPC inside shouldnt just be randomly sipping tea while I ransack their chest... either pummel me unconscious or run away and report me to school. 

If I throw an exploding spell recklessly... that random npc person should be accidentally blown to bits... 

Again not fully go Voldemort but just live in a reactive world. NPC's in this game right now are nothing but pretty decorations.

My initial example was too out there... but I think you know what I mean. We both want the same thing... just a living reactive world.
            Can you stop calling it skyrimify as if skyrim was anything more than your first example of a game like that rather than the creator or pinnacle of the type of game lol
                Not everyone is going to have the same reference points for a given trope in media. Don't be so elitist.
Also, could you imagine anything more stupid than being caught murdering students and then getting points deducted from your house instead of going straight to Azkaban.
Complexity is often the enemy of fun. Some is good, but too many systems causes confusion. Better to have a few well-understood systems, with plenty of choices within those systems (e.g. different spells or different gear), rather than doubling the number of systems that players need to understand.
There’s some sort of update/announcement coming soon per a recent tweet so maybe they will end up changing their mind on DLC given the game’s success.

It's an unreal game. So you can just make blueprint plugins in UE and throw them in the game.
I have played the game. I enjoyed it a lot, even as a non-fan of Harry Potter. I played it, completed it, and moved on.

The game has beautiful visuals and the gameplay was familiar and done well. The story left a little to be desired, but story is oftentimes the hardest part to excel at. 

It's clear that they put a lot more effort into the visuals and the verisimilitude of the game world than they did the story and RPG mechanics, but in no way did I feel like and of its pitfalls made the game any less than "good".
On a scale that is used properly, 6/10 is accurate. On the scale that video game reviewers use, 6/10 basically means "completely unplayable trash", in that case, not an accurate description of HL.
Yeah I think the main issue I had with it was the over hypedness of it. Lack RPG elements and any elements they did add, were basic.

The whole bottom portion of the map didn’t need to exist from a story perspective. Feels a lot like they took on more than they could handle.

Edit: personally don’t know if I want to replay it and I’m a big HP fan. A game like cyberpunk thought, I’m itching for a second play through.

The first Fantastic Beasts movie hit this itch super hard. At least where he's in his little zoo.
    Yesss seeing all the magical beasts makes you just fall in love with the world. And whenever just in a trailer while browsing a streaming service you hear the main theme and you instantly want to start watching that movie.

It seems like the more niche the game, the more wholesome the community is. Purely anecdotal since idk about the other communities i don't take part in.
    This is always true in my experience. I blame the fact that popularity brings kids into communities but it could be just cope for people being people
    The same is true for DRG. one of the best gaming communities. ROCK AND STONE!

The rimworld sub is surprisingly wholesome considering what the game is
Depends on the game. Joining r/warthunder brought me peace knowing I'm not the only one being dragged through the mud every day
It also removes the enjoyment of figuring out a game for yourself. Take Palworld as an example, its way more fun to run around aimlessly and feel the surprise/excitement of stumbling across a rare pal or a new boss or something rather than reddit telling me which dudes are worth leveling/where to get them and which dudes should stay in the palbox.

Don’t care
Not really true. My nephew (10 y/o) just came out of her Elsa phase and jumped straight into Hermione mood. At the end of the day is quite a natural passage if you are looking for someone to identify with
    It also makes sense since a lot of people who grew up with it are probably reading harry potter to their own kids now.
The original Harry Potter kids have pre-teens now that are getting into it
thats a weird take, she will still get the money. doesnt really matter if you buy on sale or not. just play the game if you want to and reclaim the harry potter universe from her, or dont. the game is really diverse, there are trans characters and whatever. the developers definitely deserve the money, first part of the game was glorious und made with so much love for Hogwarts.
You seriously cannot be this stupid.
How is JK Rowling far right?
    It looks like if someone doesn't agree with the far-left even on one thing, they are far-right. It doesn't matter if everything else they believe in is left.
        I guess, lol
[There's a fair few.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_with_LGBT_characters)
Doesn't really make up for the fake that JKR is actively against the existence of trans people.
    She's not even involved with the development of the game though.

And in what way is she?
        -writing a book about a man dressing up as a woman to kill women.
-thinks trans women are all rapists and pedophiles trying to groom children.
-thinks all trans men are confused autistic lesbians.

I could list more but I'd go over any character limits, but yes she does actively state these opinions and encourages others to harass trans people.
            Oh man, you’d hate to hear about a little movie called “Psycho”….
            Any sources to back this up? I know about the book already.
                [Here 's](https://www.vox.com/culture/23622610/jk-rowling-transphobic-statements-timeline-history-controversy) an article on the more overtly transphobic things she's done.

For a more nuanced look on the subtle ways JKR's bigotry operates I'd recommend [ContraPoints's video](https://youtu.be/7gDKbT_l2us) on the subject.
                It's very public, and I know twitter isn't exactly a source but it's not like it's a medical paper, you can go onto her twitter account and the whole thing will be filled with her opinions regarding trans people. JKR doesn't hide it.

                Here's a good [TIMES article about JK.](https://time.com/5855633/jk-rowling-gender-identity/)
            All of this is utter drivel. Step outside your bubble and actually read her words.
    What did she say that's against the existence of trans people?
    She’s not at all. You’re misinformed or knowingly spreading BS. Don’t believe rubbish other people are telling you. Actually read what she’s said.
        I have read exactly what she's said and yes she is transphobic.
Downvotes because he's objectively wrong about combat. A single pattern of spells absolutely will not get you through the game because of resistances/armor, attack patterns, etc.
    Actually i got carried the entire game by using whatever single patern of spells were available. I have no shame in saying i just spammed whatever was the without a cooldown. At best you just have to look out for when to dodge some very telegraphed attacks and parries and maybe remove a shield with a color spell to match, because often you can just yeet stuff at enemies to break shields.

The game remains absolutely mediocre though

    "Conservative" as a term is not restricted to the US.
Whether she got money from the game or not, it doesn’t matter. She will still have a Twitter account into the foreseeable future, even if all her projects fail…

If I played the game, how does that promote hate against trans people? She gets money? And? Her main method of spreading hate isn’t money based… 

She isn’t an elected official either, so it’s not like she can pass anti-trans bills. Unless there’s some lobbying she’s done to push anti trans laws I don’t know of? Not like she can run out of money doing that considering she’s a billionaire…
I seperate art from the artist. If it’s good art it should be paid for. I pirated Hogwarts Legacy.
    why do you separate the art from the artist? the artist sometimes uses their money they got from making art for non-art things. that's important to think about.
        It’s important to you. Not to me.
            but you just said you wouldnt buy a game that promotes hate. but youd buy a game whose payment goes to promote hate, simply because it's within the realm of "the artist" and not within the fiction of the product you bought. very inconsistent. is it possible you just dont want to have to think about the world critically in this way?
                I don’t like hate so I don’t consume it, it’s perfectly consistent.
                    so as long as the hate doesnt affect your enjoyment of the media youre ok?

J.K. Rowling is a transphobe.
        Yeah, at this point anyone who argues that she isn't is showing their own colors.  It's widely known, it's not at all hidden, and there are *plenty* of people/sites that have done comprehensive discussions on the subject.

She never said that
    She would if you asked tho. Everything she's done and said demonstrates how much she hates trans people.
        No proof
Yeah it is a great shame 

I did enjoy the Midnight Suns game. Customizing your hero and making your deck for them. It was also fun to have so many heroes working together and interacting.
    I’m so disappointed that this game didn’t catch on 

It was far from perfect but I had a lot of fun playing it
    im still waiting midnight sun -75 with all dlc
    I hope they don't feel discouraged by sales. I'd love a midnight suns sequel.
        I would like it as well.

With more customization options and maybe actual relationships with other heroes. And also more impactful choices because the dark and light didn't matter in my opinion when it comes to the story. Also more diverse missions and not just Hydra and those monster enemies.
            My only gripe is I hate hate hated the character you play as. I’d rather play as one of the cool, interesting Marvel characters than generic hero B.
                I don't mind it. 

I just wish our choices could shape our hero better and have more range of customization when it comes to our abilities. 

Like, let's say Strange could show you how to cast some spells pushing you to be more magic-oriented. Or training with Cap and Carol to be more melee and physically oriented. 

That alone would make our hero better and more connected to the world.
        An X-men game in this style could be absolutely amazing!
Huh... Spider-Man is a Marvel game?
    Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man, yes.
    Disney doesn't even make marvel games. They in fact disolved lucasarts games. 😮‍💨

We have sony and their insomniac to thank as well as Respawn for the Jedi games with Cal Kestis as the lead and even then they dropped the ball so hard on PC.
    That’s more Sony then marvel though tbh
        It is a still game within that fantasy world

It may not be a "Disney" game or an "MCU" game but it is absolutely a Marvel game
        Also Marvel fans have had Marvel Vs Capcom 3 and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games.

The Deadpool game isn't groundbreaking, but it wasn't terrible.

The Guardians Telltale game was great fun

The Guardians of the Galaxy game was good quality also

And there are another 5 Marvel Games on the way
Guardians of the galaxy is a masterpiece. I usually dont like action games and I don't like Guardians, and I loved it.
Marvel's midnight suns, the guardians of the galaxy, insomniac's spider-man are all great. I rarely finish games but finished all of these.
Midnight Suns for me
This makes it sound like the lego devs don't just make excellent games in general. They've also made some of the best star wars games ever IMO. 

Also there's been some good spidey games over the years and GotG was good.
    The only Star Wars games to ever top the LEGO ones are the old Kotor games and maybe the new Fallen Order/Survivor games (if you like Souls-esque gameplay that is). 

I enjoyed Rogue Squadron III quite a bit as a kid, but objectively speaking it was not that great of a game and I liked it as much as I did simply because the options available for Star Wars games were not great. There were also some niche successes in the MMO space, but neither Galaxies nor SWTOR really lasted all that long (yes, SWTOR technically still exists but not with any popularity really) in the grand scheme of things.
Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy..
I mean while we’re on the topic the best Harry Potter game was also made by Lego lol.
At least Spider-Man has excellent well-designed main missions. Hogwarts put lots of obvious filler right into the main campaign.
> If Quidditch were to ever be put in a game again, I would recommend they just remove the Seeker/Golden Snitch component altogether and declare the game over after 1 hour.

I think the real problem, more than the snitch, is the fact that people act like goals would be hard to score in Quidditch.

You're flying around at easily 60+ mph on brooms throwing a ball into one of 3 MASSIVE hoops, with 3 different dimensions of travel you can use to evade defenders and no restrictions on the use of your hands to control the game ball. In the books and movies they seem to describe scoring as if it were akin to soccer or hockey, with high-scoring affairs being rare. In reality it would be MUCH more similar to scoring in the NBA with each teams scoring multiple times every minute of gameplay. 

Anybody who thinks goals with a Quaffle would be any less frequent than field goals or 3-pointers in basketball is absolutely delusional.

That introduces the other problem though, which is that because scoring would be so frequent it begins to trivialize the snitch unless you can find it early enough in the game before the better combination of beaters and chasers have started to snowball their advantage. In reality the keepers would have a rather minimal effect on the game because you could just force the keeper to commit to defending one hoop and throw it instead into either of the other two hoops that was left completely open.
    That's true.  With how valuable the Snitch is, I wonder if teams would create 2-Seeker lineups, or maybe just abandon it altogether and play 0-Seeker lineups.
        I feel like a real-life quidditch would essentially just pull the keeper 100% of the time because a keeper would have little chance at actually stopping shots on goal for the reasons I outlined above. At best the keeper would play more like a defensive back in soccer, trying to quickly steal the ball from attacking chasers before they got to the goals and shuttle it back to their own offense.

As far as the seeker goes, that's a tough one. If you had good beaters and chasers then I would think you'd prioritize pulling the seeker as well to maximize your advantage when it comes to scoring the Quaffle as many times as possible. If your beaters and chasers were worse than the opponent's, however, then finding the snitch fast would be your top priority since it would be the only real chance for you to win.
            Come to think of it, you have  people flying on brooms at 60 mph.  Once one team has the Quaffle, how easy would it be for them to keep it for themselves the whole game.  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.  Aren't they allowed to fly through a hoop instead of throwing it for easy points?
                >  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.

The magical person-seeking missiles that are bludgers flying faster than you can go on a broom would be the main thing stopping that from happening. If you tried you just eventually get merced by a bowling ball which forces you to drop it.

It seems that after each goal is scored you have some kind of toss-up of the ball in the middle of the field to restart play, same as a face-off in hockey. Thus it doesn't really matter if you throw the ball or carry it through the hoop since you go back to the center face-off anyways once the goal has scored.
Would be pretty sick if every game was similar to GTA. Harry Potter GTA? Pokémon GTA? Marvel and DC GTA? Dragon ball Z and Naruto GTA? GTA GTA? Lol
    Dragonball Z GTA. Who’s gonna stop Goku’s rampage? What army?
        Your protagonist is Yamcha
            Ahh so like a cabbage, got it.
        All the Kai’s come and jump you along with whiz and beerus
The world or hogwarts isn’t about just randomly killing people, that would add nothing to me.  
I don’t even think those unforgivable curses should even have been in the game, and certainly not with how casually they are treated.    

There are plenty of other was to make the world more reactive without turning a teenager in to a killer.
    > I don’t even think those unforgivable curses should even have been in the game, and certainly not with how casually they are treated.

I'd have been happier with the inclusion of unforgiveable curses if they came with consequences.

In the books and movies the ministry of magic can track every single spell ever cast by an underage wizard. They know full-well that some kid is going around Avada Kedavra-ing a bunch of trolls and goblins, but seemingly nobody cares about it.

Some sort of reputation system would have been a nice touch at least, with interactions with "good" characters becoming more negative the more you used unforgiveable curses and interactions with "evil" characters becoming more favorable and vice versa.
    I mean... my game of reference isn't also about randomly killing people as well. 

What I generally mean is NPC's should be part of the world and not just a pretty walking vase. 

For example, if I go unlock a house, the NPC inside shouldnt just be randomly sipping tea while I ransack their chest... either pummel me unconscious or run away and report me to school. 

If I throw an exploding spell recklessly... that random npc person should be accidentally blown to bits... 

Again not fully go Voldemort but just live in a reactive world. NPC's in this game right now are nothing but pretty decorations.

My initial example was too out there... but I think you know what I mean. We both want the same thing... just a living reactive world.
        Can you stop calling it skyrimify as if skyrim was anything more than your first example of a game like that rather than the creator or pinnacle of the type of game lol
            Not everyone is going to have the same reference points for a given trope in media. Don't be so elitist.
Yo, don't throw us all in the same category, I play WoW and I've changed my shirt, like, twice this month.
    Okay, but the real question is how many times did you shower last year?
        At least 5.
But then Hagrid has 6 toes in my face.
    Is that a problem?
Yesss seeing all the magical beasts makes you just fall in love with the world. And whenever just in a trailer while browsing a streaming service you hear the main theme and you instantly want to start watching that movie.
This is always true in my experience. I blame the fact that popularity brings kids into communities but it could be just cope for people being people
The same is true for DRG. one of the best gaming communities. ROCK AND STONE!
Same with factorio.. no time to argue when THE FACTORY MUST GROW!!!
This really does depend. The battle brothers subreddit is really good if you want end game advice. It's fucking trash if you're starting out because every other post is "trash bro, dump him, you'll never do the end game locations that are only meant for the hardcore players with that bro". 

Which is funny in itself because there are people who have cleared that location with average bro's.
Yep. Other people don’t change my enjoyment.

    but you just said you wouldnt buy a game that promotes hate. but youd buy a game whose payment goes to promote hate, simply because it's within the realm of "the artist" and not within the fiction of the product you bought. very inconsistent. is it possible you just dont want to have to think about the world critically in this way?
        I don’t like hate so I don’t consume it, it’s perfectly consistent.
            so as long as the hate doesnt affect your enjoyment of the media youre ok?
    I like your attitude.
Yeah, at this point anyone who argues that she isn't is showing their own colors.  It's widely known, it's not at all hidden, and there are *plenty* of people/sites that have done comprehensive discussions on the subject.

No proof
I would like it as well.

With more customization options and maybe actual relationships with other heroes. And also more impactful choices because the dark and light didn't matter in my opinion when it comes to the story. Also more diverse missions and not just Hydra and those monster enemies.
    My only gripe is I hate hate hated the character you play as. I’d rather play as one of the cool, interesting Marvel characters than generic hero B.
        I don't mind it. 

I just wish our choices could shape our hero better and have more range of customization when it comes to our abilities. 

Like, let's say Strange could show you how to cast some spells pushing you to be more magic-oriented. Or training with Cap and Carol to be more melee and physically oriented. 

That alone would make our hero better and more connected to the world.
An X-men game in this style could be absolutely amazing!
It is a still game within that fantasy world

It may not be a "Disney" game or an "MCU" game but it is absolutely a Marvel game
Also Marvel fans have had Marvel Vs Capcom 3 and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games.

The Deadpool game isn't groundbreaking, but it wasn't terrible.

The Guardians Telltale game was great fun

The Guardians of the Galaxy game was good quality also

And there are another 5 Marvel Games on the way
I feel like a real-life quidditch would essentially just pull the keeper 100% of the time because a keeper would have little chance at actually stopping shots on goal for the reasons I outlined above. At best the keeper would play more like a defensive back in soccer, trying to quickly steal the ball from attacking chasers before they got to the goals and shuttle it back to their own offense.

As far as the seeker goes, that's a tough one. If you had good beaters and chasers then I would think you'd prioritize pulling the seeker as well to maximize your advantage when it comes to scoring the Quaffle as many times as possible. If your beaters and chasers were worse than the opponent's, however, then finding the snitch fast would be your top priority since it would be the only real chance for you to win.
    Come to think of it, you have  people flying on brooms at 60 mph.  Once one team has the Quaffle, how easy would it be for them to keep it for themselves the whole game.  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.  Aren't they allowed to fly through a hoop instead of throwing it for easy points?
        >  I imagine it'd be basically impossible to force them to give it up.

The magical person-seeking missiles that are bludgers flying faster than you can go on a broom would be the main thing stopping that from happening. If you tried you just eventually get merced by a bowling ball which forces you to drop it.

It seems that after each goal is scored you have some kind of toss-up of the ball in the middle of the field to restart play, same as a face-off in hockey. Thus it doesn't really matter if you throw the ball or carry it through the hoop since you go back to the center face-off anyways once the goal has scored.
Your protagonist is Yamcha
    Ahh so like a cabbage, got it.
All the Kai’s come and jump you along with whiz and beerus
Can you stop calling it skyrimify as if skyrim was anything more than your first example of a game like that rather than the creator or pinnacle of the type of game lol
    Not everyone is going to have the same reference points for a given trope in media. Don't be so elitist.
At least 5.
Oh man, you’d hate to hear about a little movie called “Psycho”….
Any sources to back this up? I know about the book already.
    [Here 's](https://www.vox.com/culture/23622610/jk-rowling-transphobic-statements-timeline-history-controversy) an article on the more overtly transphobic things she's done.

For a more nuanced look on the subtle ways JKR's bigotry operates I'd recommend [ContraPoints's video](https://youtu.be/7gDKbT_l2us) on the subject.
    It's very public, and I know twitter isn't exactly a source but it's not like it's a medical paper, you can go onto her twitter account and the whole thing will be filled with her opinions regarding trans people. JKR doesn't hide it.
        Classic JKR hating thread 

> JKR wants trans people dead

> gets asked for examples

> "go educate yourself"

> <insert literally any rebuttal>

> "you transphobic fuck"
        The point is you can’t actually back it up. Again you’re parroting other people’s nonsense.
    Here's a good [TIMES article about JK.](https://time.com/5855633/jk-rowling-gender-identity/)
All of this is utter drivel. Step outside your bubble and actually read her words.
