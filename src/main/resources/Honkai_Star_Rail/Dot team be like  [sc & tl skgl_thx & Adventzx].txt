Expectation:

        Why are the prettiest Harmony and Nihility ladies the craziest ones?

(At least Bronya is pretty and probably sane)
            Bronya is the only sane Harmony/Female Nihility character. Pela and Gui are alright too but they can certainly be a little much from time to time.
                Bronya being sane is a miracle given her circunstances
                    Give her some time. A whole planet’s worth of lives and rebuilding and she will likely lose it.
                        HONOURABLE SUPREME GUARDIAN!

SUPREME GUARDIAN PEOPLE ARE STARVING!

SUPREME GUARDIAN DO YOU HEAR US?!

SUPREME GUARDIAN!

THE CITY MUST NOT FALL!

[Always psychological horror this trailer](https://youtu.be/PWlLOpqIYjA?si=ibV030mI4ILgepZm)
                            THE BANDITS ARE COMING WE MUST SAVE MY FAMILY!!
                                You see, they even have fa------ Gary
                        It's ok, she got Seele to help her.

Likely helps her relief stress by giving her plenty of turns in the night...
                            It's been a while since I've had an audible laugh, thanks
                            And Caelus's rare "visit" to both of them
                        Bronya Alter : Preservation
                    She’s right up there with Jing Yuan in the “remarkably well adjusted given the circumstances” category
                > Bronya is the only sane Harmony

...Asta?
                    Asta consider buying a squadron of what is basically star destroyers "cheap change" and a reasonable expense for some private protection.

So I'm not sure i consider her "sane"
                        You're not totally wrong, but "doesn't know how much stuff costs because her family had unfathomable amounts of money" is definitely closer to Bronya's end of the sanity spectrum than Ruan Mei's
                            Crazy Rich Astan
                        In her defense, given that her home was just attacked by a legion of aliens that are known for regularly destroying whole planets, investing in a fleet of defense ships doesn't seem that unreasonable.
                        Just because her worldview is twisted by what she considers "cheap", yes.
                        Nah, Asta is still fine.

She just operates on a Tax Bracket that lets her play God.
                        Give Asta some room she just loves shopping brands
                I was thinking why female nihility? But then I realized. Silver Wolf.
                Can't be too normal to be a pathstrider
            Idk if you’d consider a lifelong depression having learned your loving mother was in reality the person who was trying to help the stelaron destroy the planet and left the people in the underworld to almost starve, and the only people she can talk her problems through with are Selle (aka bro girl) and Serval (aka bro girl with an engineering degree) because the rest of the world has been fed the lie that her mother died trying to save the world, and now she has to try and pay back the IPC for centuries of interest and debt or the world becomes property of the IPC a sane person
                But hot purple butterfly gf

(jk that is a harsh reality for Bronya. But I trust in the queen to overcome the hardships and trust in her allies rather than become insane)
                Shit circumstances can drive someone insane but don't necessarily do so. Realistically it's almost a plothole that Bronya isn't having severe mental breakdowns and collapsing from the pressure, but as far as we can tell she's handling it well and still sane.

Side note: I think people also overestimate how many people are in Belobog. We visit the planet's one city and chunk that isn't a frigid wasteland. She's more in between a mayor/governor than a world leader in land mass and people.
                    Yes she is basically a governor or a president at best but as belibog is the ONLY settlement her decisions impact the future of that world. It’s also a sizeable city we just don’t see much of it.

Also people hide being depressed and overwhelmed really well especially when their personality is like bronya, then eventually break. We’ve only known bronya (in cannon) for a couple months at best. It’s very possible she just hasn’t hit that break yet
                        I mean, most of her world is our equivalent of Antarctica and she recently found out that there's many other humans and worlds. If she messes up the stakes are far lower than being the last bastion of humanity against the frozen wasteland, and she was already dealt a losing hand. She's obviously loyal to the world and wants it to survive but she's at the inflection point of a war that they were steadily losing for 700 years where the pressure has finally eased due to the Stellaron removal. 

You've got a good point that she's likely hiding it but we can't judge her off of how other people handle stress and conclude she's already insane. She faced the IPC trial and kept a level head throughout and has a solid enough support network where most of her society supports her and is on the same page. We're likely waiting for an assassination plot on her by the nobles to address Belobogian issues again and deal with those possibilities and her potential break.
                > Serval

Bro aunt, more like
            The reason why Bronya is sane is that she is just hyper lesbian and too committed to her GF.
            Give her time; she could still go Cocolia on us. 
            Bronya is under a whole lot of stress.
            It's always gotta be the hot ones...

Not Himeko though, she's cool.
            I can fix her.

Anyways perhaps if we lived in this world we'd think they are pretty normal compared to how crazy all the other people are. Like people who think planets are flat and shit.
            Yukong is also very much Sane, (maybe some slight PTSD but she lost her best friend in a war) I think she's very much on the pretty side.

The proper Tingyun is also very sane. Considering when we learn of what she actually does and how much she truly cared for everyone.
        >Black Swan : Hippity Hoppity your memories are my property

Memokeepers aren't very keen on stealing memories, they're more interested in observing and recording like the [rock observers from Rick and Morty](https://youtu.be/8otN31sVzWk?si=8pwuor0bYVAhZ6kW). The memory bubbles you find in Herta Space Station and Penacony are Garden of Recollection technology specifically designed to preserve memories and experiences; lightcones are IPC tech that follow similar principles (probably). So yes, Huohuo should still be afraid but for entirely different reasons.
            Memokeepers are pretty much intergalactic Wikipedia editors.

And from the lore about the Cremators faction, some of them are literally Wikipedia admins
                And the History Fictionologists are random people trying to rewrite said articles?
        Kafka : bounds the Tail  
Ruan Mei : execute research on the Tail  
Black Swan : provides consultation for Huo Huo
    >Reality: she is scared shitless for being with them given what they do for a living

oddly enoguh i'd love seeing her and Kafka meet...scaredy cat & the woman who literally can't feel fear.  


and then just have Kafka use her power to make huohuo not scared.
    More accurate, she is their life and mental support, literally.

The moment huohuo gets hit

Big sisters : who touched the child!?
    Meanwhile, Huohuo is the tankiest in their team.
        Well for once gameplay and lore are the same :

gameplay :

If the enemis hit huo huo one-sama tachi can use SP to deal more damages because you don't have to heal them.

Lore :

If the enemis hit huo huo one-sama tachi are angy and deal more damages because they can't have huo huo heal them.
        Why is Houhou considered the best healer for the DoT team?
            Aside from the ATK% and Energy on ult, Huohuo's talent on skill activation go brrrrr (gives her 1 energy when you activate her talent aside from the cleanses) when you have fast units and DoT units wanna go fast.
            Because she provides ATK% and Energy on ult.
"Throughout heaven and earth I alone am the honoured one"

As far as we know, the 3 mommies are in their mid-30s, and as for Huo Huo, it is mentioned that she is a Luofu Judge for 38 years, so we can assume she's 40+ years old.
She should be called the big sister in the DoT squad.
    Ruan Mei is from a planet that was blessed by Abundance and is likely older than Herta given she joined the Genius Society before her.

Black Swan's age is unknown as, now that she's a memetic entity, age is no longer something that she's affected by.

Kafka's the only one that would definitely be younger than Huohuo.
         Herta is 100+ years old and is 83rd member (second newest) while Ruan Mei is 81st one. RM is definitely older unless Herta became member just several years ago.
            Herta already famous since last amber era btw.
                The current amber era started in 1.0
                    Hmm you means AE2157? AE2158 is after Belobog tho.
                        The first radio broadcast on the Express starts with a sort of new-years celebration.
                            Yeah but isn't that the line was before Jarilo VI which is when the new Amber Era started?

Kafka and SW on Herta: "She looks so young. She was already famous in the last Amber Era, no? She has to be at least a hundred years old."

IPC broadcasting confirmed Qlipoth finished his new wall, turning AE2157 to AE2158 after Belobog. (Likely due to TB influence to some extent)
                                You can hear the radio broadcast before you go down to Belobog. I highly doubt the TB had anything to do with Qlipoth swinging its hammer.
                                    Only after completing Slient Galaxy (which is Belobog) that you can hear it tho?

On the wiki:

IPC Broadcast #1

After completing Silent Galaxy, the screen towards the front of the Parlor Car can be investigated.
                That's like saying someone was famous since last year, when in reality is that it was December and it just became January.
                    Yeah but isn't that the line was before Jarilo VI which is when the new Amber Era started?

Kafka and SW on Herta: "She looks so young. She was already famous in the last Amber Era, no? She has to be at least a hundred years old."

IPC broadcasting confirmed Qlipoth finished his new wall, turning AE2157 to AE2158 after Belobog.

This means Herta is famous 1 Amber Era before the game started, no?
                        Ah, in that case yeah. It's been a while since I looked at the start of game dialogue so it slipped my mind.
    Yeah, we should call her "Mommy"
        Huo Huo DMW 😭
    Black Swan is a ghost she might be like 500 years old
Moe Foxian gets sandwiched between three mommies
As a Kafka main...

This was just a bit too on the nose...

The best trio right there🙏. Now we wait for a mommy sustain that buffs DoT teams.
    Natasha's an acceptable placeholder for now.


That trio is one of my gotos for content. Huohuo or Fu Xuan for the healer slot.
NSFW: Not Safe For Wimps  
Hang in there, HuoHuo lol
Huo Huo has no idea how many would kill to be in her situation 

I can already see TB speedrunning to Yaoshi so they can get their Abundance path just so they can get a permanent spot for this team
Ahhh it would be so scary to be in Huo Huo’s place. Please don’t put me on a team with these three beauties 😭
Praying for a Huo Huo re-run sometime soon so it's not Lynx carrying them instead
Reality: Ruan Mei is M7 height

Ruan Mei 'boutta feed her some cats
Crazy cause this is my team except for I have Natasha instead of huohuo

Well I sometimes use luocha in my dot team
Is this a good team btw? I’m still building Black Swan and Ruan Mei.
    One of the very best teams in the game right now
OP I need the source, reddit wont let me see nsfw content on mobile unless I use that stupid reddit app (fuck you spez)

It should've been me, not her, It's not fair!
3 big sisters... however Huohuo is likely older than all of them combined.
    Nah, Black Swan is probably ancient, she's a memetic entity, and who knows if she was mortal before that. Kafka she's probably older than, but Herta is hundreds of years old and Ruan Mei joined the Genius Society first and specializes in genetic engineering so...
        she was mortal
            What I meant was that for all we know she was an immortal or at least long-lived species who lived multiple amber era's BEFORE becoming part of the Garden of Remembrance.
    Ruan Mei is ABSOLUTELY older than her, figuring she's older than Herta and is from a planet blessed by Abundance
Althought I normally find these "ara ara" / "mommy" post to be cringe. This one is rather funny/wholesome.
They lay a single hand on my daughter. I will take them all on my own.
Don't worry, until Luocha reruns Huo Huo gets to spend part of her time with Jingliu instead...

*waitaminute...*

Eh, Bronya's there too, so she's probably fine.
one day of thanking mhy for not making huohuo male
Is there any hope that better healer will release out in the future for dots so I don't have to warp Hou2 while I have Loucha and Fu?
    dot team also works with Luocha, unless you like Huo Huo its not really mandatory (as of right now). As for if they will release a better healer, probably, powercreep is a thing, but who knows
        Yeaah, they work great together, but it's a little better with Hou
    HouHou is great for all sorts of teams, not just DoT, so if you can spare it, she's fantastic for Jing Yuan teams, Argenti Teams, JingLiu teams, or basically anyone that relies on energy a lot, esp if she is paired with Tingyun.

That team is sp negative
    Huohuo variable, Ruan Mei always +1, Kafka should always be -3. 

You only get 5 cycles on average for the hardest content. Huohuo rarely needs to have full uptime. Run Black Swan -1 instead of -3 and your starting 3 SP is enough.
        A proper Black swan rotation shouldn't be -3. You don't really need to spam skill against bosses
Oh, look. Fetish shit for upvotes.
    You love to see it!
In-game and in-lore
man i didnt really think much of Huohuo at first (I started playing when Topaz banner came out) but after the recent couple of characters uh, character i think i appreciate her wholesomeness alot more now
I like how despite having bunch of healers, it's always Huohuo stuck with the onee-san.

Bro I was just about to finish my version of typesetting when it's already posted
You use huohuo as survival because she is the best for dot teams

I use fire mc as survival so I am surrounded by dommy mommy

We are not the same

Kinda ironic that Huohuo is actually the oldest from the bunch age-wise.
    BS doesn't have real body and RM is blessed by Abundance so she is at least 100 years old given that Herta is 83rd member and RM is 81st.
For people who run this team what slot do you run them in?
I want a HuoHuo so bad 😭. She's one of my top 3 favorite designed characters.

Imagine if Hoyo gives us a mommy 5 star healer. So the team can be complete. What would also be pretty cool if it was a 5 star waifu who is Nihility and could provide healing with a LC or something.
Hey, that’s the other version of the same comic!

*infact houhou is taking care of the big sisters*

*the fox demon may or may not have give huohou a back bone*

Huhuo: kafka stop destroying planets

Kafka: it's fun

Huohuo:for christ sake stop Ruan Mei take care of your critters

Ruan mei: no

Huohou:*becomes a demon* what did you say you little prick

Ruan mei:*scared for her life and sweating* I will take care of them

Huohou: good

Black swan: can I take a peak at your memories

Huohuo: what can I expect from a memo keeper
i wish i was huohuo...
I don't have huo huo so in exchange I use fu xuan with the burn LC  
Ruan Mei is like SU cheat girl, I can skip all the small fight , her tech is totally amazing
Omg its my main team xD, sadly i dont have Mei LC :c

Ruan Mei : Makes planets filled with impossible life forms she creates carelessly


Black Swan : Hippity Hoppity your memories are my property
    Why are the prettiest Harmony and Nihility ladies the craziest ones?

(At least Bronya is pretty and probably sane)
        Bronya is the only sane Harmony/Female Nihility character. Pela and Gui are alright too but they can certainly be a little much from time to time.
            Bronya being sane is a miracle given her circunstances
                Give her some time. A whole planet’s worth of lives and rebuilding and she will likely lose it.
                    HONOURABLE SUPREME GUARDIAN!

SUPREME GUARDIAN PEOPLE ARE STARVING!

SUPREME GUARDIAN DO YOU HEAR US?!

SUPREME GUARDIAN!

THE CITY MUST NOT FALL!

[Always psychological horror this trailer](https://youtu.be/PWlLOpqIYjA?si=ibV030mI4ILgepZm)
                        THE BANDITS ARE COMING WE MUST SAVE MY FAMILY!!
                            You see, they even have fa------ Gary
                    It's ok, she got Seele to help her.

Likely helps her relief stress by giving her plenty of turns in the night...
                        It's been a while since I've had an audible laugh, thanks
                        And Caelus's rare "visit" to both of them
                    Bronya Alter : Preservation
                She’s right up there with Jing Yuan in the “remarkably well adjusted given the circumstances” category
            > Bronya is the only sane Harmony

...Asta?
                Asta consider buying a squadron of what is basically star destroyers "cheap change" and a reasonable expense for some private protection.

So I'm not sure i consider her "sane"
                    You're not totally wrong, but "doesn't know how much stuff costs because her family had unfathomable amounts of money" is definitely closer to Bronya's end of the sanity spectrum than Ruan Mei's
                        Crazy Rich Astan
                    In her defense, given that her home was just attacked by a legion of aliens that are known for regularly destroying whole planets, investing in a fleet of defense ships doesn't seem that unreasonable.
                    Just because her worldview is twisted by what she considers "cheap", yes.
                    Nah, Asta is still fine.

She just operates on a Tax Bracket that lets her play God.
                    Give Asta some room she just loves shopping brands
            I was thinking why female nihility? But then I realized. Silver Wolf.
            Can't be too normal to be a pathstrider
        Idk if you’d consider a lifelong depression having learned your loving mother was in reality the person who was trying to help the stelaron destroy the planet and left the people in the underworld to almost starve, and the only people she can talk her problems through with are Selle (aka bro girl) and Serval (aka bro girl with an engineering degree) because the rest of the world has been fed the lie that her mother died trying to save the world, and now she has to try and pay back the IPC for centuries of interest and debt or the world becomes property of the IPC a sane person
            But hot purple butterfly gf

(jk that is a harsh reality for Bronya. But I trust in the queen to overcome the hardships and trust in her allies rather than become insane)
            Shit circumstances can drive someone insane but don't necessarily do so. Realistically it's almost a plothole that Bronya isn't having severe mental breakdowns and collapsing from the pressure, but as far as we can tell she's handling it well and still sane.

Side note: I think people also overestimate how many people are in Belobog. We visit the planet's one city and chunk that isn't a frigid wasteland. She's more in between a mayor/governor than a world leader in land mass and people.
                Yes she is basically a governor or a president at best but as belibog is the ONLY settlement her decisions impact the future of that world. It’s also a sizeable city we just don’t see much of it.

Also people hide being depressed and overwhelmed really well especially when their personality is like bronya, then eventually break. We’ve only known bronya (in cannon) for a couple months at best. It’s very possible she just hasn’t hit that break yet
                    I mean, most of her world is our equivalent of Antarctica and she recently found out that there's many other humans and worlds. If she messes up the stakes are far lower than being the last bastion of humanity against the frozen wasteland, and she was already dealt a losing hand. She's obviously loyal to the world and wants it to survive but she's at the inflection point of a war that they were steadily losing for 700 years where the pressure has finally eased due to the Stellaron removal. 

You've got a good point that she's likely hiding it but we can't judge her off of how other people handle stress and conclude she's already insane. She faced the IPC trial and kept a level head throughout and has a solid enough support network where most of her society supports her and is on the same page. We're likely waiting for an assassination plot on her by the nobles to address Belobogian issues again and deal with those possibilities and her potential break.
            > Serval

Bro aunt, more like
        The reason why Bronya is sane is that she is just hyper lesbian and too committed to her GF.
        Give her time; she could still go Cocolia on us. 
        Bronya is under a whole lot of stress.
        It's always gotta be the hot ones...

Not Himeko though, she's cool.
        I can fix her.

Anyways perhaps if we lived in this world we'd think they are pretty normal compared to how crazy all the other people are. Like people who think planets are flat and shit.
        Yukong is also very much Sane, (maybe some slight PTSD but she lost her best friend in a war) I think she's very much on the pretty side.

The proper Tingyun is also very sane. Considering when we learn of what she actually does and how much she truly cared for everyone.
    >Black Swan : Hippity Hoppity your memories are my property

Memokeepers aren't very keen on stealing memories, they're more interested in observing and recording like the [rock observers from Rick and Morty](https://youtu.be/8otN31sVzWk?si=8pwuor0bYVAhZ6kW). The memory bubbles you find in Herta Space Station and Penacony are Garden of Recollection technology specifically designed to preserve memories and experiences; lightcones are IPC tech that follow similar principles (probably). So yes, Huohuo should still be afraid but for entirely different reasons.
        Memokeepers are pretty much intergalactic Wikipedia editors.

And from the lore about the Cremators faction, some of them are literally Wikipedia admins
            And the History Fictionologists are random people trying to rewrite said articles?
    Kafka : bounds the Tail  
Ruan Mei : execute research on the Tail  
Black Swan : provides consultation for Huo Huo
>Reality: she is scared shitless for being with them given what they do for a living

oddly enoguh i'd love seeing her and Kafka meet...scaredy cat & the woman who literally can't feel fear.  


and then just have Kafka use her power to make huohuo not scared.
More accurate, she is their life and mental support, literally. 
Picture you can hear
    I enjoy reaction memes more when they have no text yet I can immediately understand them.
Basically Mr. Tail in this situation.

Ok bro
I'm 6000% a straight woman and I want Kafka, Ruan Mei and Black Swan to suffocate me. 
Same
Meanwhile, Huohuo is the tankiest in their team.
    Well for once gameplay and lore are the same :

gameplay :

If the enemis hit huo huo one-sama tachi can use SP to deal more damages because you don't have to heal them.

Lore :

If the enemis hit huo huo one-sama tachi are angy and deal more damages because they can't have huo huo heal them.
    Why is Houhou considered the best healer for the DoT team?
        Aside from the ATK% and Energy on ult, Huohuo's talent on skill activation go brrrrr (gives her 1 energy when you activate her talent aside from the cleanses) when you have fast units and DoT units wanna go fast.
        Because she provides ATK% and Energy on ult.

Ruan Mei is from a planet that was blessed by Abundance and is likely older than Herta given she joined the Genius Society before her.

Black Swan's age is unknown as, now that she's a memetic entity, age is no longer something that she's affected by.

Kafka's the only one that would definitely be younger than Huohuo.
     Herta is 100+ years old and is 83rd member (second newest) while Ruan Mei is 81st one. RM is definitely older unless Herta became member just several years ago.
        Herta already famous since last amber era btw.
            The current amber era started in 1.0
                Hmm you means AE2157? AE2158 is after Belobog tho.
                    The first radio broadcast on the Express starts with a sort of new-years celebration.
                        Yeah but isn't that the line was before Jarilo VI which is when the new Amber Era started?

Kafka and SW on Herta: "She looks so young. She was already famous in the last Amber Era, no? She has to be at least a hundred years old."

IPC broadcasting confirmed Qlipoth finished his new wall, turning AE2157 to AE2158 after Belobog. (Likely due to TB influence to some extent)
                            You can hear the radio broadcast before you go down to Belobog. I highly doubt the TB had anything to do with Qlipoth swinging its hammer.
                                Only after completing Slient Galaxy (which is Belobog) that you can hear it tho?

On the wiki:

IPC Broadcast #1

After completing Silent Galaxy, the screen towards the front of the Parlor Car can be investigated.
            That's like saying someone was famous since last year, when in reality is that it was December and it just became January.
                Yeah but isn't that the line was before Jarilo VI which is when the new Amber Era started?

Kafka and SW on Herta: "She looks so young. She was already famous in the last Amber Era, no? She has to be at least a hundred years old."

IPC broadcasting confirmed Qlipoth finished his new wall, turning AE2157 to AE2158 after Belobog.

This means Herta is famous 1 Amber Era before the game started, no?
                    Ah, in that case yeah. It's been a while since I looked at the start of game dialogue so it slipped my mind.
Yeah, we should call her "Mommy"
    Huo Huo DMW 😭
Black Swan is a ghost she might be like 500 years old
Natasha's an acceptable placeholder for now.


That trio is one of my gotos for content. Huohuo or Fu Xuan for the healer slot.
One of the very best teams in the game right now
https://twitter.com/skgl_thx/status/1763866840189825087?t=UTTmNEpHD68GBw1G19_7Vw&s=19
Nah, Black Swan is probably ancient, she's a memetic entity, and who knows if she was mortal before that. Kafka she's probably older than, but Herta is hundreds of years old and Ruan Mei joined the Genius Society first and specializes in genetic engineering so...
    she was mortal
        What I meant was that for all we know she was an immortal or at least long-lived species who lived multiple amber era's BEFORE becoming part of the Garden of Remembrance.
Ruan Mei is ABSOLUTELY older than her, figuring she's older than Herta and is from a planet blessed by Abundance
dot team also works with Luocha, unless you like Huo Huo its not really mandatory (as of right now). As for if they will release a better healer, probably, powercreep is a thing, but who knows
    Yeaah, they work great together, but it's a little better with Hou
HouHou is great for all sorts of teams, not just DoT, so if you can spare it, she's fantastic for Jing Yuan teams, Argenti Teams, JingLiu teams, or basically anyone that relies on energy a lot, esp if she is paired with Tingyun.

Huohuo variable, Ruan Mei always +1, Kafka should always be -3. 

You only get 5 cycles on average for the hardest content. Huohuo rarely needs to have full uptime. Run Black Swan -1 instead of -3 and your starting 3 SP is enough.
    A proper Black swan rotation shouldn't be -3. You don't really need to spam skill against bosses
You love to see it!
BS doesn't have real body and RM is blessed by Abundance so she is at least 100 years old given that Herta is 83rd member and RM is 81st.
Why are the prettiest Harmony and Nihility ladies the craziest ones?

(At least Bronya is pretty and probably sane)
    Bronya is the only sane Harmony/Female Nihility character. Pela and Gui are alright too but they can certainly be a little much from time to time.
        Bronya being sane is a miracle given her circunstances
            Give her some time. A whole planet’s worth of lives and rebuilding and she will likely lose it.

            Give Asta some room she just loves shopping brands
    I was thinking why female nihility? But then I realized. Silver Wolf.
    Can't be too normal to be a pathstrider
Idk if you’d consider a lifelong depression having learned your loving mother was in reality the person who was trying to help the stelaron destroy the planet and left the people in the underworld to almost starve, and the only people she can talk her problems through with are Selle (aka bro girl) and Serval (aka bro girl with an engineering degree) because the rest of the world has been fed the lie that her mother died trying to save the world, and now she has to try and pay back the IPC for centuries of interest and debt or the world becomes property of the IPC a sane person
    But hot purple butterfly gf

(jk that is a harsh reality for Bronya. But I trust in the queen to overcome the hardships and trust in her allies rather than become insane)
    Shit circumstances can drive someone insane but don't necessarily do so. Realistically it's almost a plothole that Bronya isn't having severe mental breakdowns and collapsing from the pressure, but as far as we can tell she's handling it well and still sane.

Side note: I think people also overestimate how many people are in Belobog. We visit the planet's one city and chunk that isn't a frigid wasteland. She's more in between a mayor/governor than a world leader in land mass and people.
        Yes she is basically a governor or a president at best but as belibog is the ONLY settlement her decisions impact the future of that world. It’s also a sizeable city we just don’t see much of it.

Also people hide being depressed and overwhelmed really well especially when their personality is like bronya, then eventually break. We’ve only known bronya (in cannon) for a couple months at best. It’s very possible she just hasn’t hit that break yet
            I mean, most of her world is our equivalent of Antarctica and she recently found out that there's many other humans and worlds. If she messes up the stakes are far lower than being the last bastion of humanity against the frozen wasteland, and she was already dealt a losing hand. She's obviously loyal to the world and wants it to survive but she's at the inflection point of a war that they were steadily losing for 700 years where the pressure has finally eased due to the Stellaron removal. 

You've got a good point that she's likely hiding it but we can't judge her off of how other people handle stress and conclude she's already insane. She faced the IPC trial and kept a level head throughout and has a solid enough support network where most of her society supports her and is on the same page. We're likely waiting for an assassination plot on her by the nobles to address Belobogian issues again and deal with those possibilities and her potential break.

The reason why Bronya is sane is that she is just hyper lesbian and too committed to her GF.
Give her time; she could still go Cocolia on us. 
Bronya is under a whole lot of stress.
It's always gotta be the hot ones...

Not Himeko though, she's cool.
I can fix her.

Anyways perhaps if we lived in this world we'd think they are pretty normal compared to how crazy all the other people are. Like people who think planets are flat and shit.
Yukong is also very much Sane, (maybe some slight PTSD but she lost her best friend in a war) I think she's very much on the pretty side.

The proper Tingyun is also very sane. Considering when we learn of what she actually does and how much she truly cared for everyone.
Memokeepers are pretty much intergalactic Wikipedia editors.

And from the lore about the Cremators faction, some of them are literally Wikipedia admins
    And the History Fictionologists are random people trying to rewrite said articles?
Yeah, i forgot to put that tag. Anyways how did you got so much comment karma XD
    By being a smartypants. With what being at the right place at the right time. I also edited and created a lot of memes.
        Whoa I see you did there. Btw, I'm new to this community
Aside from the ATK% and Energy on ult, Huohuo's talent on skill activation go brrrrr (gives her 1 energy when you activate her talent aside from the cleanses) when you have fast units and DoT units wanna go fast.
Because she provides ATK% and Energy on ult.
Herta already famous since last amber era btw.
    The current amber era started in 1.0
        Hmm you means AE2157? AE2158 is after Belobog tho.
            The first radio broadcast on the Express starts with a sort of new-years celebration.
                Yeah but isn't that the line was before Jarilo VI which is when the new Amber Era started?

Kafka and SW on Herta: "She looks so young. She was already famous in the last Amber Era, no? She has to be at least a hundred years old."

IPC broadcasting confirmed Qlipoth finished his new wall, turning AE2157 to AE2158 after Belobog. (Likely due to TB influence to some extent)
                    You can hear the radio broadcast before you go down to Belobog. I highly doubt the TB had anything to do with Qlipoth swinging its hammer.
                        Only after completing Slient Galaxy (which is Belobog) that you can hear it tho?

On the wiki:

IPC Broadcast #1

After completing Silent Galaxy, the screen towards the front of the Parlor Car can be investigated.
    That's like saying someone was famous since last year, when in reality is that it was December and it just became January.

This means Herta is famous 1 Amber Era before the game started, no?
            Ah, in that case yeah. It's been a while since I looked at the start of game dialogue so it slipped my mind.
What I meant was that for all we know she was an immortal or at least long-lived species who lived multiple amber era's BEFORE becoming part of the Garden of Remembrance.
Bronya being sane is a miracle given her circunstances
    Give her some time. A whole planet’s worth of lives and rebuilding and she will likely lose it.

            And Caelus's rare "visit" to both of them
        Bronya Alter : Preservation
    She’s right up there with Jing Yuan in the “remarkably well adjusted given the circumstances” category
> Bronya is the only sane Harmony

...Asta?
    Asta consider buying a squadron of what is basically star destroyers "cheap change" and a reasonable expense for some private protection.

So I'm not sure i consider her "sane"
        You're not totally wrong, but "doesn't know how much stuff costs because her family had unfathomable amounts of money" is definitely closer to Bronya's end of the sanity spectrum than Ruan Mei's
            Crazy Rich Astan
        In her defense, given that her home was just attacked by a legion of aliens that are known for regularly destroying whole planets, investing in a fleet of defense ships doesn't seem that unreasonable.
        Just because her worldview is twisted by what she considers "cheap", yes.
        Nah, Asta is still fine.

She just operates on a Tax Bracket that lets her play God.
        Give Asta some room she just loves shopping brands
I was thinking why female nihility? But then I realized. Silver Wolf.
