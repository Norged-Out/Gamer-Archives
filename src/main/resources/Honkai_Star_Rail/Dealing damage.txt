[[Dealing damage]]





Yeah but the space canon doesn't have the Gamba gods on its side.
    Plus, Qingque is Qingque.

Himeko is surely going to get the Dan treatment and have a 5 star version of herself coming to the game someday and then she will be absolutely busted
        That if she can escape the himeko fate üíÄ

Seriously tho, i hope hoyo give her power up when she join the stabby stab gang, not letting her die when getting stabbed
            I‚Äôm expecting that they‚Äôre going to do it as a fake out where it looks like she‚Äôs going to get stabbed, but march jumps in, takes the hit, and gets her power up
                Or maybe she does get stabbed, but Trailblazer gets an Abundance Path and heals her.

I could get behind that. Maybe Abundance Trailblazer could be 1% as powerful as Luocha so the f2p's who missed him can have a healer capable of keeping everyone at full HP at all times.
                    That's a good idea actually, esp to help folks have an easy second healer.
                Himeko get stabbed and then get power up
                    Its the other way around. She got a power up, sell well, dies in the next patch. 

**"Never let you go" intensifies**
            In HI3 Himeko got her Vermillion Knight: Eclipse suit shortly before Final Lesson... So here, it could be that she gets stabbed, get her cooler form, then Himeko-ed...
                Stop giving mihoyo suggestions. No I'd rather have this version of Himeko then Himeko'd.
                Worth mentioning that she was already dying at that point and had the cure for herself but chose to give it to Kiana. This Himeko is currently healthy unless that coffee causes something.
                    That coffee is the cure
                        Amen
            I'm calling it now.  She becomes the new Aeon on Trailblaze.

And March is a Lord Ravager equivalent to Fuli.
            With how her quest went, I‚Äôm fully expecting Kafka to get final lessoned instead of Himiko
            Isn't Himeko really good in SU?
        Wait, but she already is a-

Huh? You know what, you're right. One day Himiko will get the 5 star treatment and her well deserved glow up.
        And then Qingque gets an even more gambly version of herself as a 5 star too.
            New qinque:   
Skill - When skill is cast, uses 10 stellar jade to attack. Each reroll costs 10 stellar jade.

Ult - Spend 100 stellar jade and 10,000 credits to aoe dmg mobs.
                When you run out of Stellar Jades, she uses your credit card to attack.

When it declines and can no longer spend, she says "Guess this is the end. Fish tiles, get them." with no sadness in her eyes. This has a 50/50 chance of either deleting your account or your OS as she inflicts pure AoE Quantum damage.

        Himeko: new 6 star characters coming soon /joke
            I mean, let's be real, there are *at most* two Permanent Five Stars that feel like they're meant to occupy a similar power level to any of the limited five stars released to date, and one is *Bronya* who is the only five star harmony support and as such behaves entirely differently from the many four star nihility/harmony supports. Limited Five Star and Permanent Five Star *should* really be two entirely different tiers and only aren't because people feel less bad pulling a five star they didn't want than they would pulling a Four Star Bailu when going for Luocha, even if she would naturally be just as far above Three Star Natasha as she is under the current system.
                sure, same way there is a 3 star tier for cones .... I mean, why? That stuff is, rarely one or two exceptions, going straight to the salvage bin...

why not start with 1 star? Why 3? Probably because gatcha players are used to 5 and 6 stars, or SS and SSS and SSSR ...
                    "Gacha players are used to SS" sure is a sentence
        What if we get 5* QQ dealing qinqquillon dmg with no skill pt. cost uses no. Of turns of teammates to match tiles opposite of how yukong loses stack with her eidelon effect added to her base kit with 100% trigger chance when her enhanced atk crits


I'm full of copium
            Omg PLZ YES
        It would be ironic, if they made her a 4 star alter. Which is better
        Nono, give her the QQ treatment and make a 4* version of Himeko that is absolutely busted at E6.
        Himeko in a pseudo Surtr armor when?
        But she is the 5 star version of herself
        Think of all the energy lost traveling from space.
    Read that as the Goombah gods ar first
    I love the word "Gamba" because in spanish it means shrimp.

So Qinque has shrimps by he side
QQ is powered by the procrastination, the strongest primordial force in the universe
    And she slacks less than me.
        You have to work hard to become the best procrastinator
    Path of procrastination when?
        QQ will ascend to Aeonhood any day now...
            She is procrastinating the aeonhood. So she will never become an aeon.
    ‚ù§Ô∏è
    stronger than power of love?
Also pretty much everything does more damage than a gun (musket)
    I think there is a Dps build of Bronya. With 100% crit rate and build mostly crit damage + atk (propagation buff in SU too) she can deal good single target damage.
        Is this not just how you build Bronya? She has a baseline 100% Crit, and her ultimate buff literally scales off crit damage, so Crit Damage is her best stat for every concievable reason.

Then you build speed because obviously more turns is king.

Then you build effect resist to 30% so you can get party wide crit damage because it includes Bronya.

At this point, you're so deep into substat RNG, you'll probably take whatever you get. Atk% substats might be nice here, but they aren't gonna make a huge difference. I'd want HP/Def at this point so she doesn't just get instakilled by something like Phantaliya flicking her. And this is also true for pure damage characters as well. Can't do damage if you're dead.
            Bronya already has 10% effect res from traces and the set has 10%. You only need 3 substats roll into effect res which is quite easy. 

~~The difference between DPS build and Pure Support is the main stats for the body and sphere. Either Crit damage for the body and Atk%/Wind damage bonus for Sphere or full HP builds to be tanky.~~ 

Oops. Forgot her ulti scales with Crit Damage stats.
                I'm pretty sure the body is always Crit Damage because crit damage scales her Ultimate, so Crit Damage is her best stat all of the time for both damage and support.

The only flexible mainstat would be Wind Damage/Atk orb vs HP/Def orb.

I mean, you could run an HP chest on Bronya but I think that would be really niche extreme difficulty content. Which I think would be true for literally any character in the game.
                    Oh yeah I forgot about that part of her Ulti. My bad. I also use Crit Damage and Hp Sphere (planning to change to Wind if I get 1 more Bronya).
            There's 160/161 speed Bronya builds, for when your hyper carry wants to run attack boots, has naturally high CD so you just want them to take a bunch of actions.
    Bronya has a gun? More like a pointing stick lol.
    When everyone is superhuman gunpowder is a waste of money.

Well... the satelite IS far away, so...
I can't take it anymore. I'm sick of Qingque. I try to play Seele. My Qingque deals more damage. I try to play Himeko. My Qingque deals more damage. I try to play Clara. My Qingque deals more damage. I don't even try to play Herta. I want to play Silver Wolf. Her best team has Qingque. I want to play Bronya, Yukong. They both want Qingque.

She grabs me by the throat. I farm for her. I buy the Battle Pass for her. I give her "Another Peaceful Day". She isn't satisfied. I give her full Lvl 15 Quantum Relics. "I need more than Stats" She tells me. "Give me more Skill Points". She grabs Seele and forces her to Basic Attack. "You need to give me more Tiles. I can deal more damage with Mahjong & Eidolons"

I can't pull for more Eidolons, I don't have enough Stellar Jades. She grabs my credit card. It declines. "Guess this is the end." She grabs her Fish tiles. She says "Fish tiles, get them." There is no hint of sadness in his eyes. Nothing but pure, AoE Quantum Damage. What a cruel world
    Did not expect to see the OPPA Xl pasta hereüíÄ
    Oppa QQ
    QQ is hsr's XL
After playing Xenoblade 3 and Guilty Gear, I‚Äôm just gonna assume that there‚Äôs just an entire archetype of characters who are small but randomly have the most insane damage output because they thought it was funny
    YIPPEE
    May I introduce you to Pitch Dark Hook the Great?
    Anything is tame compared to guilty gear's smol characters, Star Rail has dosn't have TOTSUGEKI levels of bullshit yet
        Please, do not remind us of the bs dolphin
        The dolphin doesn‚Äôt even cause the funny damage output when the anchor murders all your health
    You assumed correctly
The goofy ahh tuna drawings boost the damage
    Those are tuna? Is she throwing kiana?
It's not about the physical damage of Qinque's attacks, so much as it is the audacity of a small lady chucking a Mahjong tile at extraordinarily large beasts and heavily armored foes.

How it feels like using qq
    What anime is this?
        To aru *something something* no index
The answer may surprise you
5 star qingque - nihility - spends sp to accumulate paperwork needed for 'correction', throws stack of paperwork at enemies. If hit by 4+ stacks, 100 base chance to inflict 'overworked' on enemies, instantly ending their career, causing crippling depression/doom/debt, leading to inverse Mara if not resolved before turn is reached.
Why she looks like she's shooting a laser out of her boobs
Little girl beating you up = emotional damage^2
##It depends, what clothing is Qingque wearing?
Qingque supremacy of course
Depends entirely on the kinetic energy of the Mahjong tile.

QQ was the first main dps i had before i rolled any 5-stars and now shes op in swarm :v 

Maybe i need to try her abit again
About the same in my case
I mean, if a friggin suplex can hit harder than stellar system-scale explosion... this one isn't new
Don‚Äôt the enemies turn into tiny versions of themselves on her gambling board? They probs take traumatic damage if anything
You will be surprised to learn the answer.
That mahjong tile has some mf'in WEIGHT to it!

Well, if both of them are E0 then Himeko is the winner.

She is procrastinating the aeonhood. So she will never become an aeon.
Bronya already has 10% effect res from traces and the set has 10%. You only need 3 substats roll into effect res which is quite easy. 

~~The difference between DPS build and Pure Support is the main stats for the body and sphere. Either Crit damage for the body and Atk%/Wind damage bonus for Sphere or full HP builds to be tanky.~~ 

Oops. Forgot her ulti scales with Crit Damage stats.
    I'm pretty sure the body is always Crit Damage because crit damage scales her Ultimate, so Crit Damage is her best stat all of the time for both damage and support.

The only flexible mainstat would be Wind Damage/Atk orb vs HP/Def orb.

I mean, you could run an HP chest on Bronya but I think that would be really niche extreme difficulty content. Which I think would be true for literally any character in the game.
        Oh yeah I forgot about that part of her Ulti. My bad. I also use Crit Damage and Hp Sphere (planning to change to Wind if I get 1 more Bronya).
There's 160/161 speed Bronya builds, for when your hyper carry wants to run attack boots, has naturally high CD so you just want them to take a bunch of actions.
Or maybe she does get stabbed, but Trailblazer gets an Abundance Path and heals her.

I could get behind that. Maybe Abundance Trailblazer could be 1% as powerful as Luocha so the f2p's who missed him can have a healer capable of keeping everyone at full HP at all times.
    That's a good idea actually, esp to help folks have an easy second healer.
Himeko get stabbed and then get power up
    Its the other way around. She got a power up, sell well, dies in the next patch. 

**"Never let you go" intensifies**
Stop giving mihoyo suggestions. No I'd rather have this version of Himeko then Himeko'd.
Worth mentioning that she was already dying at that point and had the cure for herself but chose to give it to Kiana. This Himeko is currently healthy unless that coffee causes something.
    That coffee is the cure
        Amen
When you run out of Stellar Jades, she uses your credit card to attack.

When it declines and can no longer spend, she says "Guess this is the end. Fish tiles, get them." with no sadness in her eyes. This has a 50/50 chance of either deleting your account or your OS as she inflicts pure AoE Quantum damage.
sure, same way there is a 3 star tier for cones .... I mean, why? That stuff is, rarely one or two exceptions, going straight to the salvage bin...

why not start with 1 star? Why 3? Probably because gatcha players are used to 5 and 6 stars, or SS and SSS and SSSR ...
