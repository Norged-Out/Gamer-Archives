[[This memory of chaos is really putting the MOC in mocking, how is everyone else doing]]





People called story Aventurine weak and he only said "aight **bet**"
    They had to nerf him in story 😭
        He aren't that hard now. I missed to try his pre-nerf fight(

He got Childed fr fr.
    honestly I feel he actually hits harder in the story pre-nerf. the bigger problem is how much he stalls in this moc when you only get so many turns to obtain all stars.
    People were literally saying he was nerfed specifically for the MOC version on that post though lol, so it seems they were right.
That fucking purple dinosaur hits harder than my dad's belt
    LMFAO 
I feel ur pain buddy 😂
    But not as hard as my mom's chancla
        That's the next story boss
    Definitely not harder than my mom's slipper 🥲

i wont even attempt for shorter cycles.  
That was torture 💀
    Xueyi player holy shit
        I love Xueyi's design & play style.  
I have a seele but she dont hit as hard because sad relic rolls 😔.  
Xueyi's easy because she just uses excess thiefs from weekly boss farming
            May I ask how you've built your Xueyi..? As in, the prerequisite stats, her LC, and so on?

I'm not planning on pulling for anybody until Robin and she's a support, so I have room for building another DPS. Xueyi seems genuinely interesting and her animations are amazing, but I have low eidolons on her so I was going to put her off for another time.

Then I saw your clear with her, and it intrigued me enough that I'm now planning to build her too lol.
                https://preview.redd.it/zia2l0eaunuc1.png?width=1602&format=png&auto=webp&s=98050024f0842e3ed7fdc237cf983b3183c163ed

Here's my Xueyi build that I've been cooking for a while now. Cleared the dino floor in 5 cycles without Ruan Mei with Tingyun / Sparkle / Fu Xuan. Ideally you want a Break effect rope, ATK% orb (not quantum DMG) and Crit DMG or Crit Rate body depending on your substats. Herta shop light cone is absolutely the best one for her from the current selection available to her. Quantum 4-set is better but thief set was more easy to find good substats for since I had an abundance of those pieces from farming that cavern + weekly bosses. 

  
ATK% orb is because Xueyi gets a lot of bonus DMG % from break effect so quantum DMG% would just be diminishing value on her. Try to squeeze in as much ATK%, Break effect and Crit substats as possible. I have ATK% boots because I use Sparkle with her so Xueyi can stay low speed very comfortably. Speed boots are a fine option if you have no turn-manipulation supports to use with her. She has fairly low ATK so she benefits from Tingyun's ATK boost quite a bit. I use Inert Salsotto since she's E6 and therefore does follow-up attacks far more often. Before E6 I think Space sealing station, Glamoth or possibly even Rutilant arena is better to use if you have no good Salsotto pieces.
                    Thank you very much! I've saved your comment and I'll be referencing it in the future for my build on Xueyi.
                Xueyi needs a lot of stats so it's not easy. avoid Dmg% orb, go for ATK%, Break effect around 150-170, the usual crit values, and speed. You'd have to look at your supports available, if you're running her with Ruan mei, you can go a little less on BE & Spd, but there's a little anti synergy with ruan mei's extra break delay. with sparkle, you can drop speed. and focus on atk% instead.

Xueyi at e6 is so fun
        She's really good against the dino though!
        I'd be a Xueyi player if I could get some goddamn eidolons

Same. Although my retries were in the 1 at half cause welt kept dying

    That 2nd team - 3 of them want to use skill every turn 💀
        Doesn't even matter, SP bot Luocha + properly built sparkle can sustain even QQ and DHIL. Sparkle is E2 DHIL level of cheat.
            Didn't know that was possible. My Sparkle is only at 145 something speed, and I'm still sweating trying to provide Skill Points Points for DHIL and Yukong using their skill every turn.
        Sparkle ults every 3 actions so it doesn't matter.
my sparkle also have Bronya's lc because i didn't roll for her sig.
Skill points is infinite lol
I hate that dinosaur with shield
    Same

21 turns left with this.

I don’t know how others will do this without some of the units I had.
    https://preview.redd.it/8hp49n7dhluc1.jpeg?width=778&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff91fa18668a4037c13b23544c2e4b6a20ccf57b

First half took 3 cycles, second half took 5.

Aventurine is so annoying to fight. He wastes an entire cycle every time he uses his gambling mechanic.
        I KNOW RIGHT!?

He does his gambling thing *EVERY SINGLE TURN*  which is fucking ludicrous, who the hell approved of this? I played jingliu bronya and ruan mei, and every time i set up all their ults and buffs, Aventurine just said "yeah no" and got me to unleash my planet-destroying attacks to some dice instead.

This boss fight definitely needs some tweaking
            Some good ol' stalling. Genshin players faced this with the Wenut now HSR can experience it.
                That mofo is not in abyss very often right?
                    Yeah not a regular luckily. I always suffer when it does though. I have 2 minutes for it generally and I still cut it close to the 7 min mark. It's invulnerable for like 50% of the time iirc?
        What are you feeding your Seele?
            Bronya nudes if she low cycles
                Does silver wolf/bronnie's have the same effect?
        What eidolons and gear are your 5 stars? I'm assuming E6 Pela, Tingyun, and Lynx as well?

I did mine within 10 cycles but had E0S1 Acheron, E0S1 SW, Sweaty Pela, and Trendy Geppy in 1st half; 2nd half was E0S1 Hanabi, E0S0 Jingliu, E0S0 HH, and E1S0 RM
        Can I see your Seele build please
            4 pc Quantum set + 2 pc Glamoth set. 3250 ATK, 81/180 CR/CDMG.

I say Sparkle and Tingyun are more important here. You don’t need to aim for that high amount of crit damage. Just go for crit rate while Sparkle does the rest
                Oh our stats aren't too different ngl
        Wait wtf I used the exact same teams as you (except I used Fu Xuan instead of lynx) and I got the exact same number of cycles, 3 in the first half and 5 in the second
        Fr, it's impossible to do this without luocha lol. I used Acheron 1st half, jL second half and finished with 20 cycles
            Not really no, I used E0S0 Huohuo, E0S0 Jingliu, E0S1 Hanabi, and E1S0 RM for the 2nd half, tho it took me 7 cycles to beat Bossventurine

First half was Acheron E0S1, SW E1S1, Sweaty Pela, and Trendy Geppy in 3 cycles
                Luocha carried me so hard lol. I got unlucky with the dices but his cleanse was key and helped me clear in almost 4 cycles (just touched 5). And I messed up first half with Acheron cause Gallagher and welt were on life support 💀
    https://preview.redd.it/lebfzyuyxkuc1.jpeg?width=658&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b585455cecfe80aca3c96a8192c207a1e9c078c7

Specifically needed to use Acheron on Node 2 since her team mates can use AOE and not get fked by Aventurine (I didn't feel like using JL/Bronya/RM/HH). Qingque slams Node 1 anyways.

It felt like it was even more difficult in Stage 11 since I always get killed by Soda Ape >:(
        Madman with not even fully leveled up units.
            what acheron and gamba does to a mf
            Extra 100hp wouldn't change anything. 
                Extra HP and defense! On Tingyun that's like, an extra hit she can take with how squish she is.

Also, for Black Swan that's more damage since it's also Attack...
                nah I survived aventurine coin blast with 112 hp on ting with luocha support.
            What's the point of leveling supports past 75? Their lvl 80 traces in 9/10 cases are useless and 5 levels give barely any stats for required resources.
                Survivability, extra bit always helps.
                they'd take less dmg from the level difference mechanic, otherwise it kinda just looks nice.
                They must have infinite money for that
        Almost using same team. Switch luocha and fu xuan and exchange BS with SW.
            I aren't builded Pela before (guilty as charged), so use Welt instead. He too has DEF-. Only on Ult, tho.  
But IMG break without break is good too.
                "I aren't builded"... My eyes are bleeding... 
        I was using bronya JL pela hh and I was getting obliterated in second phase. This is first major gear check I had to face I feel like.
    how did you find jingliu against aventurine? I fear his dice mechanic might cause a waste of turns on the state, I know he gives you energy after it, but what if you run out and the ult only comes when you are already out of the state? You save ult for dices?
        Its why u badly want -1 spd Bronya (or Sparkle) to circumvent losing on dmg turns to come back online faster and also hypercarry buffs to implode him outside his dice phases.

Or Tingyun+Huohuo it and just almost never leave enhance state…
            my experience with ting and bronya -1 is that I have to skill twice with ting in a row leaving me with skp issues for next cycle (I don't have sparkle) I could use pela for def ahred but my acheron might want her too in half 1
        You really want Bronya / Sparkle, because I think a key mechanic is just wailing on Aventurine outside the gamble and breaking him at least once. Bronya was also useful to get Jingliu back into the Syzygy state during the gamble mode.
    This MOC is definitely a pure sustain check rather than dps obecause Aventurine does a stupid amount of dmg and has annoying CC Goodluck to the people who have been skipping the limited sustains cuz this will be rough for them
        Or you can permabreak him with Ruan Mei and Jingliu 135+Bronya 134 wombo combo
            people who dont have limited sustain units and ruanmei D:
        My 50% ERes Nat and 70% ERes Lynx came in kinda clutch.
        Lynx seems to contribute more compared to other healers maybe unless it's Luocha.

I even need to bench Fuxuan in favor Lynx in Adven fight since the guy deals too much damage for Fu to sustain.
            Yeah i was surprised my fu xuan actually struggled against him lol
        Ghallager kept things very comfy for my team.

Elemental weakness was all messed up because I don't have a good ice dps. But JY got the job done as always.
        Except for Luocha and Fu Xuan I have everyone else you've used, might try it later
            Could be rough, Aventurine is a big sustain check
        Who should i replace the likes of Ruan Mei, Topaz and Fu Xuan. I have all in the setups other than those 3.
    https://preview.redd.it/uoskde8qrkuc1.png?width=2388&format=png&auto=webp&s=24b1dd61abf27ea0b596915289b78ee06840c497

Bit similar except I move ruan mei to Jingliu side instead, since I find Kafka BS + sampo or gui is good enough for 1 or 2 cycle clear. Didn’t expect Aventurine to be so tough tbh, maybe if I swap Bailu and Huohuo there I can shave off 1 or 2 cycles.
        i had luocha in part 2 and i got creamed
            Same team (With Luocha) and it was pretty straight forward. I'm pretty sure Bronya and Ruan Mei have HP or Def Orbs though and maybe defensive armor too. Luocha might also have a defensive orb. 

Comfort > an extra CD sub roll.
    Fucking shit, i have the exact same units but i still can't do it!!! 
Broo, could you share your build?
        Refer to Prdywyn Endgame stats, I follow it basically. Sig LC on Kafka, Jingliu & Black Swan.

One thing I’ll note is during Aventurine’s gamba, I make sure Huohuo healed everyone to full.
    I have only 4 (JL, RM, Geppy and TY) of those, and only 2 (JL&RM) actually built.

    [Acheron team 1 cycled first half + Jingliu 3 cycled Aventurine.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1040520426046111754/1229330334924148746/image.png?ex=662f4a17&is=661cd517&hm=4888f3544573f2ad92b2cf7c3044eb8012d1e22d61323a1703ec65f226eb2b34&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)

I think as long as you time your aoe and breaks to avoid getting gamba troll on the 2nd half, you can save quite a few cycles. First half I found breaking the new dino fast helps a lot with clear time as well.

The most time-consuming thing for me unironically is resetting on 1st half since the enemies keep focusing Kafka or SW instead of Fire TB...I legit reset like 20+ times maybe more just so that the mobs on wave 1 focus fire TB, my Nihility units (especially Kafka) are the new Tingyun.
        How did you 3-cycled Aven with JL? Is yours E1? It still took me 5 cycles with some good RNG on my side, otherwise it would definitely take one more cycle.
            > How did you 3-cycled Aven with JL? Is yours E1? It still took me 5 cycles with some good RNG on my side, otherwise it would definitely take one more cycle.

My Jingliu is E0S1. Ruan Mei is E1 so that might have been the reason, cuz her E1 gives 20% def ignore.

Believe it or not , this bs setup worked for me. It seems like something that could never work but it did even without any weaknesses on the second half .

        For some reason I can't post text along with an image. Anyway, QQ with Sparkle and Fu Xuan activates the 3 quantum bonus andbl Ruan Mei helps break the purple dinosaur fast. It's a 3 cycle clear.

Then side 2... not the best team but it's a 4 cycle clear for Acheron. Luocha is literally just a healbot with no synergy with Acheron. Would have preferred to use Gepard with Trend but he kept losing his bet and getting imprisoned and couldn't maintain his shield lol.

Another team I used, this one was 22 turns left.

All my stats are basically the recommended stats on prydwen. LCs are either Signature or their BiS 4\*.
Weirdly unbalanced MoC.

It took me more turns to beat Adventurine than the rest of MoC combined.
    Same here. Aventurine’s gambling mechanic wastes your turns a lot
    was coasting through the lower floors with ease, Aventurine then held me up for 3 hours. unbalanced it is
    For real, i beat stage 1 with only 2 turn

Stage 2 take me 8 turn...
    Is he that annoying to face? Cause I had fun against his boss form in the story pre-nerf. And I was sad that I couldn't face him repeatedly anymore so this sounds like good news.
        Still a good fight, but I imagine the turn limit combined with his incredible tankiness is going to frustrate many, many people.
            Yeah that's probably true. I guess I'll find out soon lol.
        That dice face waste time+he's tanky af+without proper sustain his attacks are nuke+if your unlucky on dice phase good luck
    Yeah no kidding, I was suprised how easy moc11 was (autoed it with only taking 4 or 5 cycles) only see zero chances of 10 cycling moc12 for the first time since fu release
    I might have to double-check it, but I believe you can trigger the stage effect on his dice. Which does... ***nothing***.

For example, I got into his 2nd phase and had a few hits on him, he was at maybe 93%? health. He whips out the set of 4 dice, I use my abilities on it, I see the stage-effect animation trigger. A couple turns later when the dice go away, I look at his HP and... 93%.

I usually struggle a lot w/ MoC but I managed to get up to Floor 11 with three stars without too much issue. But I'm not sure if I'm even going to try and clear Floor 12 because it seems like the Aventurine boss is gonna be a huge pain to deal with if you have to time your attacks so perfectly that his constantly-spammed dice skill doesn't act like a giant shield for him.
Can't spell masochism without MOC
    Really giving me MOC-onal damage
Does zesturine's gamba win recharge Acheron ult?
    Aventurine is special in that it gives an instant Ult instead of Energy Refill. So unlike other sources such as the TV, he actually recharges Acheron.
        Basically, functions just like Erudition path in SU
        Let's. Fucking. Go.
        Wait the TV doesn't recharge Acheron? Brain in a Vat works so I figured the TVs would just give Acheron 2 or 3 bars for her ult.

~~(Correct me if I'm wrong but I think Auspicious Star works too)~~ I have been corrected
            The TV doesn’t work, no. Neither does Huohuo or Tingyun’s Ult. They refills Energy, but don’t immediate max it out.

Not sure about Auspicious Star (I don’t actually have Acheron) but I believe it refills Energy so it doesn’t work with Acheron.
    Yup it does
        Holy baby
I haven't even started yet. What's this MoC like?
    Till floor Floor 11 pretty easy, floor 12 is a tank check, aventurine does crazy damage plus gacha dice or buffs and nerfs.
        https://preview.redd.it/1aj058pz8kuc1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f4d8ba5c5fa96e291cf972f88c1d5e1c0ebd417

My Gepard can't sustain enough against Aventurine. One of my Nihility queens keeps dying. Bailu was enough though.
            Wtf is skill points on your first team ha ha ha.
                Positive, negative, neutral, technically negative but you won't be using her skill often due to slow Acheron since she's just ult botting off the DoTs.
                    Lightning lord Acheron for real. Even better since there's no JingYuan holding her back (by being cc'ed)
                Skill points are enough since the fight is over after 1-2 cycles. My Gepard is speedy(142) for SP generation. Kafka(160+) BS(142)

Aventurine took 8+ turns lmao
                The mommy team (Kafka Swan Acheron Mei) has always been about overcharging Acheron so hard that her own skill becomes optional. He's running a trend tank over RM even.

Your actual turns matter little on this squad. It's just Acheron ult spam from trend procs, swan cards and kafka FUAs.
Way too much stalling on floor12 that I might just leave at 35*.
https://preview.redd.it/8jugvh0tkluc1.png?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa9f1c73073b388b9c93150f4c5a0748fddb8728

9 cycles. Bailu is a life saver, she is amazing against Aventurine. Revive + invigoration + damage reduction are crazy good. I usually like to retry MoC just for fun, but not this one. I'm so sick of the chonky dino and Aven boss mechanic ugh.
    Wait, Bailu is meta again? Let's goooo.
    Did you have any trouble with Aventurine's dice eating the stage effect damage? I haven't fought him much yet but when I did a couple times, I think I noticed that if the stage damage effect triggered during the 4-dice round, the dice would take the "damage" and Aventurine would be left unharmed. So it was a huge loss of DPS for me because I've been relying on the stage effect pretty heavily this MoC, and I'm curious if others had the same issue and how they dealt with it.
        Yeah it messed up my rotation. The only reason I can finish this one in 6 cycles is because I let Bronya died and Bailu revived her, so I don't have to use any skill point. Need to be careful when using JL ult too. Overall not a very fun boss.
    Honestly though I've felt Bailu was underrated for a long time (not that she is better than the limited 5 stars, but people saying Lynx is better were imo capping, after I got Bailu it made content so much easier compared to when I had Lynx), but yeah she's actually great for this fight and her passive is such a lifesaver as it's so easy for someone to randomly die.
it is like they double the diffuculty compared to last MOC. My main acc which has all strong units normally can clear in 3-5 cycles, now need 7-8 cycles. The Aventurine boss mechanic is really crazy, even BS+Kafkfa team takes 5\~6 cycles to clear him
    Indeed. Also went up from 5 to 7 cycles for me. 4 cycles for Aventurine alone with my strongest team (Dot), which only needed like 1 cycle last MoC.
I got an issue where the MoC buff got triggered when doing dice thingy, so it doesn't give any damage to aventurine


Well of course, it's skill issue. I'll try again later on
Gonna wait for zesturine to beat zesturine. 💀
i 15 cycle'd stage 12
    Same lmao
    ayo same
Haven't tried it yet, but is this MoC 12 just really bad for Dan Heng IL or why is almost no one using him?


It generally feels like in these kind of posts as if less and less people keep using him. 


As someone who skipped Jingliu, the DoT characters and Acheron, I wonder if I can even clear it this time...
    With RM and Sparkle he will do quite good in the first half of MoC 12, especially considering that RM isn’t as good vs aventurine. 

It’s kinda just extremely uncomfortable MoC. Enemies have just absurd amount of debuffs and toughness, so it just feels bad.
        The worst one tbh. DHIL is pretty much useless in the first half and I don't have another DD and RM so no way I'll be able to close it with 3 stars.

Aventurine is easy though. Only these shitty shield dynos are insanely chunky.
            Actually, if you happen to have Xueyi, it’s a rare MoC where she feels really good to play. QQ also works somewhat good. 

My Dan is E2, and I cleared with him in 4 cycles (could’ve been 3 tbh, I got a bit too greedy with the first wave.) And I managed to do 3 cycle with Xueyi with a somewhat mid build. And mind you, I kinda have skill issue, lol.

I think second half gave me more trouble, as I lack any premium sustain. With Gepard, my Black Swan had just 80 hp left when I was done. That dice encounter is kinda too tight, lack of Fu Xuan really makes it hard.
                E2 DHIL slaps because you get an additional turn after the ultimate. My DHIL is E0 only, so he is kind of useless.

Like, the devs really optimized the last floor for only a few five-star characters (JY, DoT, follow-up), and it's sad.

I dropped this game after SW's release and just recently returned just before 2.0. So, no good time for me.
                    I know, I brought up that mine is E2 just to highlight how good Xueyi is in current first half.

But yeah, without E2 it’s rough. It’s not even about his damage, it’s about amount of break he does. Thought I ran Sparkle, SW and lynx for Iamgainaty weakness on cocolia, but I think that Dino is the real problem, it has more toughness than a boss(?) for some reason?? And it’s again not about damage you do, it’s about your sustain. Lynx is not enough until you consistently break, since Dino just deals absurd amount of damage. Overall, this new elite is kinda overtuned. They REALLY want you to have a good breaker.
                        It's also about damage. My DHIL, who is 80/160, deals 100k damage to Aventurine (+Sparkle). Since it's less than 10%, it will take at least 10 more turns to kill him (over two phases). That is already enough not to get three stars.

My Acheron, though, takes two to four turns to defeat Aventurine.
                            Because he has imaginary res… That’s why I suggested him only for the first half.
                Yeah QQ is fine, she cleaned up side 1 in 3 cycles and my e0s1 acheron cleaned up side 2 in 4 cycles.
                I’ve been swapping my E2DHIL around trying to figure out where he should go, what was your strategy for each half?
                    First half I went with E2 Herta lc DHIL, E1 sparkle with DDD, tutorial SW and lynx. Weakness implant on whatever doesn’t have img weakness and just break it. Focus on dino more, since getting rid of it ASAP is the key. Actually, SW could’ve been replaced with RM or Tingyun for even faster Dino break, but I haven’t done multiple attempts, Cocolia might’ve felt like a joke explicitly due to addition of img weakness (she was banished into shadow realm practically with being mostly broken)

  
Second half I just brute forced with E0S1 Kafka, E1 EotP BS, E1 S3 MotP RM and Geppie.  Like, absolutely breaindead strat (I wonder why my BS had 80 Hp at the end)
                        thanks! i don’t have rm, gepard, or sw, but i do have luocha and bailu lol hopefully i can make something work!
                            Luocha for the first side and bailu for the second and you shouldn't struggle that much. If anything, it should be a bit easier from survivability point 
    That Dino really counters Hypercarry due to its big ass weakness shield (which kinda demand RM) and short window to burst him down (and long ass stalling from that weakness breaking)
    This MOC 12 has less imaginary weak enemies than the previous one. 

Node 1 have two meme dinasaurs weak to IL element but their mechanic(receive less damage before weakness broken) is really annoying for hyppercarry comps and there's also mama cocolia with a huge burst if you don't break or kill her fast enough. 

Node 2's 1st phase is alright with the Ascended and IPC senior staff BUT 2nd phase is just suffering for imaginary damage dealers since Aventurine boss has high img res.
    Well i used him first half and he cleared in 3 cycle the 2nd half i use acheron and she cleared in 1 cycle

He's till good with Ruan Mei
        What about without Ruan Mei?
            Slow... at first, I pair him with SW to break the Dino, but it takes too long, and I don't have sparkle. Mine is atk boots e0s1 DHIL
    Yeah, I don't think I can beat it either. Similar situation in that my best built dps is DHIL and I don't have Jingliu or the DoT characters. I used him on side one it took him 6 cycles. I decided to pull and build Acheron and Gallagher late, so her build is kind crap and she can't help yet. My Xueyi or Seele could maybe do better on that side one but I don't really have a dps for the ridiculous Aventurine boss anyway so I'm just gonna give up without even clearing 12 and take my 33 star clear.
    I used mine in the first half with Tingyun, RM and Sparkle (mine is E2 DHIL). I had to use him since he's my only DPS who can clear fast. Though it took me multiple retries due to dying. I used my Acheron team in second half.
    I have invested heavily in my DHIL team, so I can only speak from my experience.   

&#x200B;

Not sure how his E0 performance would be, but I used my E2S2 ERR DHIL for everything (except for MOC 9 because I wanted to use Jingliu at least once). He seems fine if you can dedicate his best supports for him. Without the eidolons on the supports he probably just clears 1-2 cycle slower.   

It was definitely tempting to take Sparkle away from him for Acheron though.

&#x200B;

Just for fun, I tried to brute force DHIL against Aventurine as well. It took 2 cycles to clear that fight.

    I managed to clear it with DHIL first half and Argenti second half. I skipped Kafka, Acheron, and Jingliu too, so it was definitely a struggle.

the whales with E10 S100 dps need to stop writing “too easy” in the community surveys
    eidolons and 5 star LCs definitely are a factor, but resources are also extremely relevant. I don't buy top ups like the whales but I did buy every BP since day one and I often forget how much more resources I get compared to f2p players
        I still think the biggest issue is people avoiding relics and investing too much into traces and especially levels. Lvl 10 traces and sometimes lvl 80 characters are luxuries that should only be pursued once your relics are up to par. Lvl. 8 traces (or lower for unimportant ones) and lvl. 70-75 (for supports at least) work fine before then.

It's also possible people hyperinvest too early into their favorite chars without budgeting time to farm relics for new DPSs.
            people are only doing that because relic farming has awful rng, while traces are guaranteed progress. its better to spend 1000 energy with raised traces than 1000 energy with zero useful relics
    it's not whales lol, any f2p day 1 player should be able to clear with plenty of leeway unless they avoided pulling most meta units
[Challenge record](https://i.imgur.com/qnfRZIE.jpg)

This moc was very unbalanced imo, I could easily clear floor 7-10 in under 2 cycles but the difficulty suddenly jumped in floor 11(5 cycles) and 12 (10 cycles). The gorilla with bronya on floor 11 was extremely hard to clear as i did not have a shielder on that stage to help against the bottles which he threw and the bronya was also very annoying (advance forwarded the gorilla).

Acheron-E0S1
Sw-E0S5(her bis 4 star lc)
Gepard-E0S2 trend
Pela-E6S3 resolution

Jingliu-E0S5 aeon
Ruan mei-E0S5 memories of the past
Bronya-E0S1
Luocha-E0S3 shared feeling

I think people hate on luocha for no reason at all, I saw many cc's and people on reddit say that he was getting "obsolete" and "powercrept" wherein my case he could sustain against aventurine just fine.
    Realistically, Luocha is still insanely cracked with his 0 sp usage and absurd healing, I think people mainly hate on him as every other 5\* limited sustain just does stuff other than heal. Fu Xuan has the CC prevention and crit damage increase, HuoHuo has the energy and attack increases on her ult and even better cleanses, and aventurine has his ult debuff and subdps capabilities. Luocha just has buff removal from his ult and no other damage capabilities, it just seems more worth to pull for a character that helps with clearing speed and such.
    I may have to use rm instead of pela on my JL bronya team. I was getting massacred in phase two.
    Bailu is also great for the Aventurine fight. She put in a shift for me and it's so easy for him to randomly kill someone where you can't do anything about it.
    I got massacred against the dino with Luocha. Honestly atp, preservation seems to be better at sustaining than healers. Managed to clear first half in 3 cycle wih Acheron but Aven took 5 with Jingliu.
I finally got all the stars using Argenti as at least one of the teams. I have never been so proud 😭
    pls howw my argenti is so mid TwT and hes the only one i can use on second half (curse you 70% img res)
        I also used Argenti on the second team. I had 6 turns on the Aventurine boss and I was really cutting it close and had to retry a few times. This was my team.   
- Hanya with 179 spd, Planetary Rendezvouz s2 and Penacony set  
- Tingyun with DDD s3  
- Gepard with 135 spd and 3800 def  
- Argenti with sig LC, 2881 atk, 59.3% crit rate, 163.7% crit damage and 128 spd
    may i know your teams? i was debating using argenti on the second half
        He’s definitely being hyper carried: I have Bronya E0S1, Sparkle E0S1 and Fu Xuan. So really he is being ‘carried’ by the supports, but whatever it takes to use who I love 🥺 (I also have Black Swan/Kafka/Acheron as my other team to carry my turn values). These are my only teams though, so I have to make them work
Man  Aventurine boss is Hard That i had To use an Underbuilt Gallagher Just so that i could Replace Tingyun with bronya in the second half.

But Gallagher popped off really well,He managed to keep everyone alive So easily despite being squishy and lacking In trace buffs

But Back To the the Second half,I had to retry alot And i only won because i timed My ult with Jingliu and broke Aventurines Toughness bar Before He could Start his Gimmick again

    wait, don't adventurine kidnap jing and force her to waste your stack?
        You gotta gamble that that possibility doesent happen
        Hey there, trailblazer! Just so you know, Aventurine's name doesn't have the D after his first letter! :]

*The D goes to a different place*

        Thats why It took me 21 tries to get it Perfectly,i also need Jingliu in her State to Hit 3 dice fill her ULT up
    You can get away without sustain in 1st half if you are lucky. But that's frustrating
        The dino is annoying though
            Yea very annoying. I was pretty close to no sustain but figured out that it's not worth it
https://preview.redd.it/fnsqsbt4hluc1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f97554ae3e0b12d1965c70f8583aafa8b086e219

With Clara,you can bruteforce everything if he hit her.
    3-staring MoC 12 phase 2 with M7 is crazy. How did you build her?
        the imprint this time you can bruteforce it simply by keep attacking to get it to 6 stack and explode for free 150k dmg. make follow up very good at this moc. was thinking doing the same but clear it already with DoT team
        Probably a regular tank build. She's just a shield/taunt bot for Clara anyways.
I'm stuck at Sam level cuz I'm challenging myself with Welt sustain for Acheron 😂. Oh boy, need to max her traces
I've been full starring for about 8 months now and I think I really might give up on it this time. We all know HSR caters to new releases and that's 100% understandable--but only to a degree. Scaled to MOC12, Aventurine is just "random bullshit go" meme personified. 

The mechanics add up to be a whole web of favoritism for Acheron (and probably Aventurine himself,), clearly, but think about everything added together:

* You can't count on being able to hold ult due to the minor energy drain
* You prefer an offensive sustain, which leaves you with Luocha, Fu Xuan, and Gallagher only currently? Two limited 5\* plus one new 4\*, and again, you cannot necessarily hold ult
* Else, both your sustains and supports need decent eff res or they'll be imprisoned
* You need to reserve skill points for the dice, and he spams it constantly
* Your DPS can't be too reliant on a burst of damage because of the dice, and did I mention he spams it constantly?
* As a final cherry on top the blessing stops working for the most part in your favor come the latter half of phase two because 4 of 6 of your attacks will be spent on the dice and the shockwave will hit the dice

The concept itself might be interesting, but in practice, it is utterly joyless to play against this. It's like asking you to lift a rock with 8 of your fingers tied behind your back.
    For an offensive sustain March 7th works pretty well. Her follow-up attacks count to the stage effect, which is a huge plus.

My personal issue is just that I can't really experiment with teams as easily since I have to get through the other floor as well. I don't have much of an issue clearing the Cocolia floor but it takes a fair bit of time. So it takes a while just to get to Aventurine, and that means if I want to tweak my team I need to go all the way back to the start >.>

But we still have a month left for this cycle of course, so I'm not too worried. I have Acheron but she's not well-built yet so I didn't even use her against Aventurine, and since I got Argenti I might just try and focus on using him instead. There's still time to adjust teams and build characters further. And I'm saying this as someone that didn't even get past Floor 8 until last MoC, lol
Bad, i haven’t pulled for anyone of the ‘meta’ characters so I’m struggling a bit
    No ruan mei, no jingliu, no sparkle, no DoT 5*

Me: Guess I’ll die
        You’re right, except for Ruan Mei, I pulled her while trying to get Xueyi
            Well, at least she is amazing and complements Xueyi perfectly
                I don’t have Xueyi
                    ...oh

RIP!

Here's hoping you get her on Standard Banner!!
                        Hopefully, I’m afraid ghallager’s E2 was too valuable
                            tbh I ended up getting both Luocha and Acheron just because I needed E6 Gallagher... I actually like both! Too bad I probably won't be able to pull anything else of note in the next few patches :(
                                I wanted luocha but the wrong imaginary unit came 😭
                                    I... I have E2 Welt iirc... :(
            I pulled her trying to get e6 March lol. Got her not twice but four times :’D
                Xueyi or Ruan Mei? Both are very possible and very terrifying
                    RM (it took me 250 pulls, I won the 50/50 4 times, and lost once to Himeko. I don’t think I’ll ever be this unlucky lucky again. I was literally considering getting Blade bc she kept coming when I wanted March.)
                        Hey, at least your support is busted
                            Agreed, I used her with Himeko in one of the floors today, and I was surprised at the 40k burst damage from Himeko. I forgot that my RM was e3, so it’s probably partly due to that.
    My only sustain and healers are the ones you get for free lol 💀
        Other than Ghallager, same
    Username checks out

Nah but for real good luck, I always like to see off-meta MoC clears so I hope you can make it happen!
I just checked Star Rail. Is this MoC out for other servers right now?
    It’s out for Asia server. For NA it’ll be out in around 2 hours
Phase 1 taking 6 turns for me even with Acheron I don't think I can 3 star this one


Maybe if I had a better Seele build I could have used her instead
    Maybe because you don't have her sig LC, pearls LC, and a sustain that can debuff. Every 1 thing you lack here draws you away from Acheron ulting. This is literally my alt account's situation that is why it takes years for Acheron to ult. Can finish 1st side within 5 turns but the 2nd side... damn.
        I am like 30 pulls away from E2 but I'll just have to wait for rerun now cause I am out of pulls. I don't even have sig LC

My only other nihility are Welt and Pela, I could probably clear faster if welt had more damage but rn only Acheron does damage in my team
            Black Swan does good amount of AOE damage too, but my other team needs her for this MOC.
                I don't even have black swan lol
Once again, Hanya/Luocha benefits from the weather buffs
Guess it'll be a struggle for players that use a single target dps for the aventurine fight
i literally finish every other floor in under 4 cycles but i cant finish 12 even in 15.....they rly dont know how to powerscale properly
Adventurine watches as Argentina wins the gamble and bout to drop the 180 energy burst

(Yes i purposely spell their name wrong)
    Omg its tomato from genshin impact!
     *The D goes to somewhere else* >:(
        He gets the knight of beauty special treatment. ;)
    I didn't consider how fun Argenti would be against Aventurine. Too bad I can't just casually challenge the Aventurine side first to test it cause I do not want to thru a whole first half for it. (I really wish we'd have the option to pick which side to challenge first, is there even a reason why we shouldn't be able to?)
the lack of a Jingliu does hurt quite a bit. Yanqing with Gepard isn't enough sometimes cuz Yanqing can't hit enough dice to win gamba. Lose gamba = no soulsteel = no dmg.
    cuz they want Misha to shine, he’s the “budget” dps option here. He even has a Blast skill that doesnt need an “Enhanced” State to use, and it charges his Luggage Lord stacks (winning the gamble gives him free Ult to use too)
Looking through the comments as one of the 4 people who skipped Acheron feels weird

Guess I'll die
    It will be too funny if some dps in the coming patches will make Aventurine boss look like a joke.
        Boothill is typed well but not sure how he'd do against dice.
Floors up to 11 are okayish. Floor 12 is bs mainly because of aventurine (and no, this is not story aventurine). Hitting his dices should NOT count towards the turbulance effects, It just goes to waist every single time. Putting a rng boss with two phases, with an rng turbulance trigger, on the harderst floor of MoC. This is just a bad design, not made for MoC.

Used a fairly f2p comp,

1: E0 Ratio Cruise, E0 Topaz with Sword dance, E0 RM Cog, E1 Bailu

2: E6 March, E6 Pela, E0 SW, E0S1 Acheron, dice roll is in my favor this time because my whole team managed to pass the gamble unscathed.
    Even sw? Damn that's some luck.
        Yeah Aventurine drew a 6, her burst somehow landed a 6 and her basic did a 3, never been so glad lmao
            I thought it's only one action then it resets? Like you have to gamble for every attack
                Nope it's cumulative per gamble, for example if SW has burst she have 2 dice, if Pela has burst 5, and 7 for Acheron but I never keep her burst so only 3 from skill.
    I see another fellow March enjoyer. I used that exact same team for Aventurine. Genuinely think March is one of the best sustainers for Acheron if the rest of the team is optimised.
        Really enjoy her tactical playstyle and that tiny bit of healing from E6 even tho SP intensive. I also often choose her than other healers for SU run as solo sustain. Her freeze came in clutch too during Aventurine fight just now.
Gonna try it when I get aventurine tomorrow

the buff help me make it at the last round,with Clara and blade
This moc rotation got me malding fr

That second phase aventurine gamba every two turn is stupid af
Aventurine is a big tank. Luckily, his damage is still not as big as Story-Boss pre nerf... He *definitely needed* a nerf there

But at least those "easy pre-nerf" people can have their fun in this MoC
I'm waiting until I can fight ~~fire~~ Aventurine with ~~fire~~ Aventurine.
It seems every 2 weeks now there will be a post like this as the latest MOC or Pure Fiction gets increasingly harder and more players start getting filtered.

  
Can tell that just like with the previous pure fiction, there's a very obvious incentive to bring Jingliu along one side of the last floor.
WILL YOU JUST!!! DIE ALREADY!!!!!!! Why did they have so much hp for me? Even when I went solo sustain, double support it still took like, 8 cycles to beat the first half? I know that you have to break the t-Rex’s weakness or whatever but he still won’t FUCKING GO DOWN!!!
What's MoC buff this time around?
Honestly I keep trying but this content fucks me up idk, gonna use a guide
Stupid fucking barney won't let me clear MOC 12
    i couldnt pass the first half without anyone dying half of the time because barney always attacks twice and sometimes the attacks land on the same character multiple times
All the way up to MoC 11 I had nothing slower than 28 rounds remaining.

MoC 12 though, I barely got to Aventurines half before hitting 20 rounds left so it's gonna be a bit brutal for me.
It's pretty tough, Stage 12 has Cocolia and Aventurine, and Aventurine's stunlock phase is annoying. If anyone is interested in the run then here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hcw\_b0A7E4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hcw_b0A7E4)

Because I do vertical investment (so no built ice, quantum characters), it was a bit challenging but doable regardless.
I cannot wait to try full stars it without Jing Liu, Acheron and Dhil.
Surely the game won't punish me for not pulling for the broken dps since launch, right ?
Surely it won't be a "you have JL and Acheron = easy VS you don't have them = suddenly extremely challenging", right ?
Well, I didn't try it yet, but since this game is becoming more and more a meta dps check and that the "you don't have JL and Acheron" team is playing an even more different game each time, I hope it won't be the case here.
I don't mind some powercreeping, it' normal in a gacha and if they want people to pull for the overpowered waifus/husbandos, but it is becoming a bit too harsh not having the likes of JL and Acheron.

Edit: Did 35 stars, so it's ok, but as expected it is so much more difficult without Acheron and JL.
I was so happy when my full stacks LL went into Aventurine Dices. Even though JY has good weakness advantage, a character who doesn't do damage immediately is fucked against Aventurine, a boss who stalls turns, yes even with Sparkle. And all the Acheron owners are saying this MOC was pretty easy. 
I won't tryhard 36 stars, I won't be able to do it anyway. But yes, again the "Acheron and JL less team" is having a hard time.
    As long as you have 5* supports, you can comfortably clear with most DPSs. Aventurine is a bit harder as you'd also need a good sustain on top of that, but if you can get by the dice mechanic with AoE attacks, you should be fine.
        I'm glad if that's the case then! I was also malding because, for me at least, I know it is different for everyone depending on your roster, last moc(s) and current (?) pf became suddenly harder and seemed to heavily favor meta dps owners and/or big spenders who pull for everyone in the game and can afford to hard pity every time if they got unlucky,  I mean it's normal, but it seemed too much. (not having JL in the ice weakness everywhere period was already harsh too, now it will be Acheron time, at least I have a good King Yuan so I will be able to do something, but he's sadly not quite on the same level)
Obviously you will never face any difficulties if you have jl and acheron with eidolons, but it is an extreme case.
            The games favours people who pull e0s0 for every character and doesn't go further, tbf.
    Same, dont have jl or acheron, or DOT char
Can only *35, it sucks seeing those 'required' char to fullstar, ig ill leave it at *35 :') 
Tried to use dhil, meh 
The only lightning i have is jingyuan😂 seems impossible
        Yep, we'll stay strong dude. Everyone, including us, who is clearing 34 to 36 stars, depending on the moc, without JL and Acheron is already a chad.
    Never did and never will require a meta dps. The supporting cast is much more important 
That MoC just unbalanced, how am i as a 2fp supposed to clear that? On the first side Dino boss that counter my active DPS progress and at the same time there's tanky Fridge boss that also happen to be able to apply whole team speed debuff permanently. Basicly -5 cycle with similar stalling on Cocolia. And that's alright for MoC to spend 5 cycles on one side, but "fun" only begins from now. Second side where Senior Staff boss wich has more HP pull than that Ascended HAS NO MATCHED WEAKNESS, great isn't? Thank god he has no RES, but that is -2 to -3 cycles... And now that abomination of a boss — Aventurine. Takes away energy from all team on additional actions, has more HP than Cocolia plus two phases where on second phase hes gonna either kill your entire team or lock them OR eat 1-2 cycles in one action — last two is guaranteed btw, enjoy. Is there something i forget? Ah, yes — usless Memory Turbulance. What theese 30% damage increase for if they are gonna be refreshed after cycle ends and all bosses one way or another gonna stall for that moment. It's uptime is miserable as our player experience with that MoC. Like survivability is not even an issue — it's arragment of whole MoC with Memory Turbulance and Aventurine boss. IhateitIhateitIhateit.

    nah with ur characters it looks doable to me, try putting rm on first half instead of tingyun since break is way more important on first half, surely u have pela built cuz she would help acheron a lot on 2nd half

this memory turbulence gives a **guaranteed debuff for any attack** when its under 6 stacks, so u can save some sp on welt there, comes pretty handy for acheron

although not very comfy, i did it with this. (acheron is e0 gnsw)

ok, i got it. thx to your comment i continued to try. i made a couple more different teams, but this ones were the best choices i could go with, since the main goal was to keep damaging toughness bars of the enemies and prevent them from debuffing my team. 

still, rng was mad crazy. at one point Dino decided to focus all of his attacks from additional action on squishy Bronya and almost killed her which led to a natural restart. though such surprises did not happen often and overall survivability was fine. like 1 time for each side — only from new attempts there were 2 such cases and the second one, which happened on the second side, i did not have to restart.

dealing with elites on both sides was also fine. I concentrated 75% of the damage on more tanky ones (Fridge and Cocolia with Senior staff and none other than Aventurine) and relied on memory turbulence to help finish everyone off except Aventurine obviously. Acheron ultimate was last action on a last cycle and i couldn't afford to lose any cycles with second phase of the boss.  

probably yesterday i was not so interested in understanding the mechanics, but once i read them again and tried to thoughtfully play the game everything worked out.
Exactly on 20 cycles. I stopped counting how many times I been retrying this just because I wanted to use 2 Dan heng on top and bottom😮‍💨

Managed to squeeze 20 cycles on the last one. Gonna try again with March 7th to get no deaths

This motherfucker clutched a 20 cycle on floor 12 by healing everyone to max just as they failed Aventurine's gamble

  
***Twice***
Is it okay that I've basically not really done MOC at all? Am I missing out on just the rewards you get?
    Don't worry about not being able to push the higher stages like 11 and 12 but just attempting the lower level ones are a good source of free jades and also gives you the currency to buy lightcones from the shop.
    You're missing out on a lot of free jades and other materials
    Ya don't have to do it all nor fully star it,just do anything you are able to,it's free pulls,if you get stuck at x stage u still get the jades from the stages u cleared
    u aren't missing out on a lot of free jade at most u can get is 720 which is only 4 pulls per MOC or PF. as long as u try to collect as much as u can u aren't missing much
    Up until floor 10 its piss easy, literally just free gem. You can skip floor 11 and 12 if you want.

The Ascended will make things difficult if not dealt with immediately, otherwise, save your ult in phase 2 and hope for the best
literally auto'd till moc12 and then got my shit kicked in by aventurine so i'm going back to do that later
... Dunno haven't touched any stages after floor 10 yet. But will probably get clapped cause my build sucks
im only having problems with stupid dinosaurs
I used more turns on floor 11 than on floor 12. Both times Aventurine rolled a 4, so it was easy to win at the dice. I even got the two achievements related to the dice without even meaning to.
Did horribly a month ago. Have been looking into building teams and proper relic sets since. So far I'm average which isn't much better than before
As someone who hasn't pulled the newest units: "I'm in danger haha"
i see... lobotomy kaisen has reached you
this MoC truly is our SpecialZ
Most I took so far was 5 cycles, but MoC 11B was doing comical amounts of damage putting a lot of pressure on Lynx and Clara. For a moment I was considering pulling the trigger on buying Something Irreplacable.

Will be several hours now before I can challenge 12 unfortunately, but I can already tell Aventurine preceded by one of Clara's worst enemies on an ice only stage is gonna suck. Side A should be easy enough for Arlan/Sparkle/Fu Xuan though.
    Update, I have now played MoC 12.

Holy shit. This might be what finally defeats me.
Acheron absolutely crushed Cocolia but DOT with Sampo barely scraped by 20 cycles. HuoHuo sustained extremely well but Aventurine’s health bar is so spongy that with Sampo unable to help break his shield, it took forever to chip down his health bar. I had 28 cycles left after first half.
I haven't done the main story yet so it's the first time I faced Aventurine. And wow he's pretty tough cookie huh? Could only clear him on turn 21. Was pretty worried Huohuo couldn't solo sustain the team but she pulled through.
https://preview.redd.it/l4ia8kcw1muc1.jpeg?width=922&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22db0001becb36e2d1149861e33f76d42361a3ec

Knew that one day I would be able to justify pulling for Acheron even tho i already had a minmaxed lightning hypercarry in my roster. Didn't think it'd come around so soon! :D

But maaan it felt weird prying fu xuan away from jing yuan. The casino boi hurts.
    Congrats!

In all fairness, acheron is basically a rainbow dps due to how she works (res pen plus all type toughness break), so that's your justification anyway!
    Do you have her LC? I'm the same in that I had all the lightning DPS's but Acheron would be very universal for all content.
        Yes, barely had enough to get to pity on thr LC banner and won, thank God. I had not even a single copy of GNSW with a full year of play time and all the pulls on this banner. So it was all or nothing. Would have been nice if I ever won a character 50:50 tho, this was my 6th loss in a row. Really had some hopes and dreams that this would be my time and get an eidolon or two, but nope. 200 pulls in. Still only a single acheron. Can't wait to one day get her e2 one day!
fu xuan said nuh uh and aventurine perished after only doing 2k shared damaged to my fu xuan after drowning my other 3 units in coins.
Aventurine is crazy with his Imprison. The dice also made me waste my JL ult to cleanse and emergency heal my supports via Huohuo. That really scuffed my rotation at times (as in ulting have 3 stacks, get into gamble, fire and have 2 stacks, gain JL ult, drop chips ult, cleanse and heal with Huohuo clutch 6 cleanses, heal start rotation). I only get that kind of rotation twice in 1 fight. Sometimes I hit 3 dice and get less than the gamble. 

The dino lowkey stalled me a small bit which annoys me a bit. I finished that in the first move of the 3rd cycle which was pela atk (as in one atk from support and it died in the 2nd wave).  So overall 8 cycles total.
I only managed to complete it thanks to Acheron (´；ω；｀)

I have really well-invested 5 stars including Acheron, with signature Light Cones, and managed to get 22 cycles. Idk how tf ya'll F2Ps are doing this. Good luck.
Fucked. Won't be doin MoC 12 any further for the sake my sanity ✋😶🤚
I only have DHIL, Ratio, and Blade as my dps lol. Waiting for Aventurine so I can at least clear this moc 12-2 regardless of how many stars I'll get. Aventurine phase 2 got me messed up 😭💀
God damn, MOC12 is painful.
My Gepard literally cannot take it, imma come back once I have Aventurine lol

Aventurine on last turn. Those dices are obnoxious af
people are saying its sustain check, but its more like ruanmei check cuz fuck those purple trex
This Moc and the last one (12) are impossible for me, I have too many bad substats across my relics. Even with all the units I have and high trace levels, I can't get any stars, let alone 3 stars.
Can someone please explain Adventurine's mechanics? Thx
    There are two notable things about Aventurine boss


-He has an aoe attack that can either reduce your energy or delay your action.

-When he activates his skill, he set a random number that range from 2 to 9, your characters will have to hit the dices. If your character gets a bigger number than his, they will get their ultimate up, if not they will get hit. One character in phase 1, your whole team in phase 2.
        Ty
        in phase 1, is his targetting random or position based?

getting QQ kidnapped is the worst feeling, you either lose a shiton of sp of lose the gamba
            Gamba for the gamba
        is it 2 to 9? in phase 2 he always pull 7 to 9 which sometimes even if your unit use blast skill it is still less than him, crazy
            For phase 2, he has a rigged die from 4 to 9, with 16%, 20% and 40% chance to hit 7, 8, 9 respectively.

The odds to beat his dice rolls are about 50% for 2 hits, 85% for 3 hits and 97% for 4 hits.
    who's aDventurine?
        Someone who likes adventures, duh
        i dunno, probably a friend of archeron and inhibitor lunae

Wasn't too bad, 1st side was easy. I don't have Jingliu so second side was a bit tougher, Topaz was really only there to kill the monkey, could've been another harmony probably.

Rarely use Clara but she did great with some junk relics.

Hyper ratio goes hard
    What is even that second team
        Already tried a lot of combination like pela + sw + archeron/sw + sparkle + archeron and such

but somehow this is the only way for me(my archeron is f2p, no sig lc) 

Aventurine is pretty tanky and has untargetable turn, so i need to find a way to finish it as fast as i can hence 3 dps
            The 3 dps makes sense since you can spam Ults if you win the gambles.
    What lc does he have?
        Well, his signature..

I pull it because i need another dps lol
I'm not going to even attempt it till I pull Aventurine. 

Last MoC was my first time being 12, issues has never been getting the 20 cycles, it's not fking dying. 

Once I get Aventurine plus my Gepard I'll be fine
    Aventurine (character) sounds like he'd be pretty fun against Aventurine (boss) because of the AoE attacks leading to the follow ups
"If you dont have Kafka or Acheron, you're gonna have a bad time" ahh MOC
    And jing liu
        If you have argenti he absolutely mogs aventurine since you can get his ult from the gamble pretty often

Planning to improve this run but this was the result of my first run xD

also don't mind MoC 11, I just wanted to try out Sushang because I missed using her  ( ͒ ́ඉ .̫ ඉ ̀ ͒) 
I'm waiting for aventurine to drop first so that I can use him against him lol There's probably an achievement for doing that.
Finished 7 then dipped

*barely* made it.. cocolia ult really bit me in the ass, had to retry few times because of her
    Yeah, the dino may be scary, but if you don't weakness break cocolia then it can be brutal.
        honestly, the dino came across more annoying than scary... due to the fact that i only have kafka to break its weakness

but yeah, cocolia really is brutal

Don't have 5\* limited sustain, fortunately March worked fine
    Bailu, Serval, March7, what a Chad line up!
The moment the moc resetted at 4am my time I 36* it immediately and flew threw it.

MOC 11 was absurdly easy compared to MOC 12, I have the best Acheron team and Jingliu team but can't win since it takes too long
The difficult bump from 11 to 12 is quite souls like.. There are n't so many carries whose all supports have AoE for those dices. Had to retry numerous times but finished it with cheron/JL in 8 cycles.
    My first couple tries I tried with "everyone pass the gamba" team of Pela, Blade, Jingliu, Luocha.

But your supports don't need to win the gamba as long as they survive the hit. Ruan Mei, Bronya, Jingliu, Luocha was a much better team even though Ruan Mei and Bronya lost every gamble (and during Bronya's turn I usually didn't even hit dice, just skilled Jingliu to get her stacks up).
Me when i saw aventurine
I'm surprised I managed to beat MOC 11.

Previous MOCs only led up to 9, and I was basically getting by pure luck.
Barely made it with my Gerpard. Everyone was on no hp by the end.

https://preview.redd.it/0yd6x62qnluc1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=8058fc1dab67f5e9d1ac5c5e65b10b88a162fe1d

this was my first attempt, my luocha died with aventurine at 3% hp left second phase. i would have won for sure if i had played smartly but i said “fuck it we ball” and tried to go all or nothing  for damage last minute like aventurine would have wanted. but alas, i didn’t have luocha ult for the betting phase so he got nuked

first half: s1 acheron, e6 pela, trend fu xuan, silver wolf  
second half: e1s1 clara, s1 jingliu, s1 bronya, luocha

there were improvements to be made with the builds. jingliu had speed boots with 161 spd bronya because i forgot to switch, luocha was using s4 perfect timing instead of s5 post op, which would have made his uptime better and have ult ready for the betting phase easier
Always getting me excited as NA server! Still yet to do it and to count the cycles

Edit: aventurine is impossible

Edit 2: I BEAT HIM! With finally being able to use bailu and acheron at the same time with silverwolf, aventurine was weakness broken way more and no died during the gamble because of bailu's clutch healing. She didn't even have to revive this round! Bailu best healer. I kinda had to do the first half sustainless though (2 and 6 cycles overall)
    Lol

    What teams??
        kafka hyeprcarry, Acheron Hypercarry
I had alot of problems with the bug more because somehow they keep attacking my HuoHuo and so my Jingliu got dot ended...I tried for 3 more tries and got it...after that it was a sweep
Can't clear floor 12 because of the blue Dino and Aventurine...

This was cycle 20 exactly
When Aventurine said it's all or nothing and nothing'ed all over my team I knew Honkai Star Rail was the game of all time
Tldr can someone explain what the gimmick is in less than 20 words. I'm on stage 10 atm.
https://preview.redd.it/ab033m11dmuc1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=758c3ee9b0e8067c5db795bf1a4273b9753616d8

Well... had to pull out the gamba queen lmao
Aventurine is one tanky mf, that's for sure. At the end Bronya and Ruan Mei were almost dead, while Fu Xuan and Jingliu were healthy enough. Probably because they're the only ones that could hit multiple dices at the same time. It took me like 6~7 cycles to beat this guy. 

Side note. Blade+RM+Fofo+BS is an oddly synergistic team that feels mega fun to run. Not on MoC 12 (no Wind weakness), but on that stage with the Dino chefs it was great.
Every day I thank the gods I decided to pull on Jing Liu's banner for QQ and won the 50/50
Im scared to do stage 12
This is the only time I’ve been able to 3 star floor 11 (thanks Acheron). I wasn’t able to survive floor 12 ;-;
I'm convinced I need an HP% planar orb on my Pela instead of Ice DMG because she's been consistently dying
    Pela isn't a DPS so yeah that definitely makes sense. 
I'm committed to leveling Acheron only with her E so it was a bit annoying. 

Seele first half/Kafkaswan second half ended up working out fine though. Aventurine is for sure the most annoying boss they've released for MoC.
i cant even get there... the fucking dinossaur keep killing one of my caracters at turn one ...
Thing really made obvious that my characters lack survivability
Cleared it in 4 cycle I'm glad i pulled acheron now my dhil don't have to carry all the time
Getting the first two stars was easy, earning the third star was hard as shit considering the only other solid sustain I had besides Fu Xuan was Gepard

https://preview.redd.it/qp1vml2qxmuc1.jpeg?width=2052&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=972ce3a1d2686dd658c372aaeaf39556b95a4d7a

Tried a couple times with fuxuan but she was dying even with the recommended 6500+ hp and 1400+ defense.  
Bailu was able to sustain but the best results were with huohuo and luocha for me.  
I was on my way to get an 8 cycle clear but I thought I could have played better... restarted the aventurine fight and played worse. I think he activated his mechanic 3 times and pretty much wasted 3 cycles.
Can't even clear 11-2, as I don't have DHIL and Himeko ain't it. Very cool also don't have Acheron 👍
I can never defeat Sam, and this time they moved him even earlier to floor 10. At this point it's some sort of gatekeeping and they should stop putting him in MoC (at least once pls)😭
The last one was hard but man fuck that electric Dino.

i have no ruan mei or sparkle I’m already dreading trying it after looking at these comments comps 😭😭
I can’t get 3 stars this moc. Damn. Can’t kill adventurine fast enough. Wtf
Aventurine was actually intense to go against. Everyone E0S0 except for Acheron who is E0S1.

I use Luka to deal with bosses with ridiculous health stat because bleed break is broken; I have some trouble sustaining the 2nd team since Kafka is the only one with AOE. 3 cycles for 1st half and 5 for 2nd.

Not too happy with the cycles but Kafka and BS kinda shoved aventurine into a locker, had a harder time with Sam last cycle because my Gallagher was still being built.

I did some bad decisions with my Seele team and I ended up with a 5 cycle clear for both sides Thank god my Acheron is strong enough that Aventurine couldn’t do much…
i somehow 36 starred in different runs? got 2* during my first run without the no downed characters star, and did the no downed characters in another attempt with 19 cycles left. it rewarded me with 36 stars. I didn't know it works like that.

Here is my clearing 3 star team. Bringing healer instead Fuxuan on Adventurine fight is probably much better since Adven deals so much damage for Fuxuan to sustain.
i got to 11 but cannot under 20 cycle floor 12
I'm just chilling on Moc 7... I may be able to do the rest. But I don't have the sanity to do that...
I was able to clear MoC 7 to 11 on auto with more than 25 cycles left, so I thought "Huh, isn't this MoC too easy?" (not that I'm complaining)

And then I tried MoC 12 and about 10 tries later still not getting more than 19 turns left. I wish Aventurine didn't have a phase 2.

Lil bro is single handedly taking 3 cycles 💀. His dices are mocking me.
I feel like this time is it, i don't have kafka e will not be able to beat moc 12
9 cycles on moc12. First half took 6. Second half took 3. 

I probably should have taken my stronger team to wipe out the first, but better to reserve it for aventurine.
Aventurine is such a good boss fight: heavily rng mechanic, tanky and immune to attack half of the time, high damage aoe attack with a change to stun every turn, and aoe energy drain when attack because why not. I love this boss so much I wish whoever came up with it get tormented in hell for all eternity.
Dk why, but I easily cleared everything except the last floor which I just need to put the second team with a better sustain
Easiest MoC to date if you have Acheron. She trivializes her side of MoC regardless of the type.

These were my teams for MoC 12 and all of them below. Finished at turned 24 since the dice waste so much turns. 

Kafka, Black Swan, RM, Huohuo 

Acheron, Pela, Bronya, Fu Xuan
    I didn't have Huohuo and my Bronya isn't properly equipped yet, so I swapped them out for Lynx and Sparkle respectively. Managed to clear level 12 in exactly 10 turns, thanks.
without jingliu this level 12 seems unmanageable, so im just gonna not do it this time lol the 60 primos arent worth stressing over
    If you happen to have argenti he clears faster than JL against aventurine because he can spam his level 2 Ult a lot
I gave up when aventurine started gambling my ass, I'll try again tomorrow lol

Treid to do it with jingliu 0 chances of clearing it so I went with kafka dot. Cleared it 1st try.
Haven't tried it yet. Do you guys think Aventurine would help make it easier? I'm pulling for him and wondering should I put off doing MoC till after his banner is out

This the best I can do now. 0 cycle seems impossible this time round. I'll wait for the China server to drop those 0 cycle clips so I can try to do it as well.
I beat everything up to stage 11 and will attempt 12 after I get aventurine because I have a pretty bad element match up and want at least 1 side to be extra safe and get his extra damage

Team 1 is literally glass cannon. All cycles were used by team 2 :/
it needs two team right?  

i am not gonna play it until i have maxed out both of my teams, and even then I don't think i will have a big problem, I have E0 DHIL with his signature light cone and E2 Acheron with her signature light cone.
The Dino and aventurine are pure pain. The problem is that they have dmg reduction and heavy rng respectively so you could have the most cracked relics but still lose cause you rolled 5 and he rolled 6. I had to have a perfect run where bronya rolled 6 in order to push jingliu. Also while I'm at it jingliu saved me big time at the end, she had 0 stacks, an ult and was after the last cycle. I used bronya to advance her, ulted and used her skill to get a free turn which saved the run. No she isn't powercrept she just has different utilities than acheron.*

The teams I used
Poorly.  Very poorly.  I have characters that can handle the story, though, and most events, so I just don't worry about the "endgame" stuff until I get optimized relics.  Y'know, whenever that happens.
It's annoying, but not that bad, was able to get a 6 cycle full clear on full auto.


If you're struggling against Node 2 move your Ruan Mei over there.  Her faster breaks and break delay will save you a ton of time, since more time in break means less time in the gamba phases.

its easy but sam fucked me up again , can't heal and he hits like a truck
After I got acheron I rushed to 10, beat it and stopped there it is pretty good for me
i am still able to clear anything with Fu xuan and Lynx as my sustains. (i have Gepard built but i stopped using him), torn if i should pull Aventurine or keep pushing my luck.   
my clears are anything but comfortable, actually quite the adrenaline rush, but so far it works.
Hook, Xueyi and QQ carry

Loved it
I went in this morning with Acheron first half, Jingliu second half and it worked out first attempt. Ironically first half is far more pain mostly because with suckier teammates you just can't break. Second half had a lot of funny gimmicks to abuse to do massive damage. 

Maybe later in the patch I'll optimize a bit and run QQ first, JL second.
Fuck Aventurine and his Domain expansion
I'm gonna anger some people with this, but as some one with both Jingliu and Acheron E0S1, Acheron is much better for the second node than JL, even though it says Ice weakness. Acheron can easily 0 cycle the first wave, and on the second wave against Aventurine, the trick is making use of his "grant an Ultimate" gamble, so she can Ult twice in a row. Time the Ult to use it just before his turn and do a ton of damage, win the gamble (skill is a blast, so you there is a high chance to win) and get another Ult.

2 cycles first half

8 cycles seccond

I was abusing Moc buff to the maximum
I feel like the last 2 MoCs have been "oh, you like 0 cycles? LOL no" 

And this time they're like "have a boss that is going to eat at least 2 cycles just from his gambling mechanic".

Look at these f\*\*king number of attempts. It took me 12 attempts to clear this stage 12 (5 attempts for playing MoC 7 to 11). I first tried Jingliu (at least 6-7 attempts), then DHIL (2 attempts), then Acheron (2 attempts) and finally I gave up focusing on the boss elements and just brute forced with my all rounder DoT team (still failed on 11th attempt due to dice RNG, but cleared it on 12th attempt).

First half took - 3 cycles. Second half took - 6 cycles (because of first the dice rng and second the elements weren't in favor so took some extra cycles)

I hope they never add this bxtch in the MoC again (at least not in higher floors 11 or 12) jesus... I really hate Aventurine as a boss.

Still Nihility for the win.. 😎 I love my Nihility women❤
I'm just waiting till i get e0s1 aventurine and gepards lc to clear floor 12 why is everyone whining here it can't be that hard?
I am really lucky to have E2 Ruan Mei (got E2 in like 60 pulls), I didn't struggle at all against Aventurine thanks to JL and Bronya. First half was easy clap for Acheron and Silverwolf.
All I can say is fuck Gepard!

No matter what side I put him on the team dies, meanwhile Luocha has no problem. This is the first time I simply can’t stay alive with Gepard no matter how many times I retry.. can’t wait for Aventurine, I just know he’s got me

It was an annoying fight for sure, but I managed to do it. Good luck to everyone !
I am doing suprisingly well, got to MOC 12 2nd half. With Aventurine coming out soon I am pretty confident I can get it done later
Did lvl 7, got the 3 stars then stopped for today
I had to settle for 2 staring the last floor. I feel like the purple dinosaur is getting in the way of me clearing phase 1 quicker. Mfer not only tanky but hit hard and fast. Smh

Got three stars with an auto play Acheron team cause apparently auto play is better at playing Acheron/peela/silverwolf/FuXuan than I am 😢 

First half DHIL team!
I'm surprised at seeing JL mentioned so often, felt like she was struggling hard against Aventurine.
Well, same as normal. Except I didn’t get one star in floor 8 when I got one last time. I thought it was just not for my teams, but based on this post I’m guessing it’s harder?
This one seems harder. The level 7 ones used to be beaten easily in 1 cycle now takes 2-3 for me.
7-11 auto 3*, moc12 0* rofl Will try more later at home

Honestly pretty well, nihility ftw lmao
last one is really hard due bloated hp numbers but rest are quite easy
This has to be the hardest MoC by a mile. The second half with double elites into double health bar Aventurine is absolutely brutal. Imagine if first half Cocolia had 2 phases as well. Aventurine also needs high single target damage and AoE attacks at the same time to win bets so hunt characters are actually worthless.

  
Doesn't help that the memory turbulence is kind of unintuitive. I had to sandbag the bets by using Ruan Mei + Fu Xuan E instead of auto to not trigger it since it doesn't damage Aventurine during the dice phases.
Autoplay did it in 15 turns, I manually did it in 7 turns. Go figure.

with E1 gepard, I was able to permafreeze him by using skill and then bronya to pull him again and rinse and repeat
[It did take me 2 retry on auto, but I just used my usual suspect team.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0U7JMtXt0I)
I got humbled so fast. 1-11 was quite easy. Surely there were some bumps but i only had to retry once. But 12.. nah... Nope. It was painful.
Constant gamble stalling and energy steal is absurd from Aventurine, but on the bright side Silverwolf + Ratio makes quick work of Side 1, much better than Jing Yuan did for me. Ofc if you have Kafka or Acheron use them instead there
Dot team first half / acheron team second half....now i tried jingliu on second half and boi is she bad because an entire stack or ult is wasted on the gambling mechanic but with acheron i can stall her ult and barely finished on the last cycle
Cleared it as soon as it got out, needed 2 tries for floor 12 tho becouse my pela got 6 on the dices after using her ult and unfortuneatly died but other than that I feel like it was a breeze

for me aventurine is impossible, he spams his dice garbage every turn, so everyone dies after max 1-2 turn, no matter what combination of teams i use result is the same as he always get 9 and i always get 1 or 3-4 if i use aoe. MoC12 was complete turn off for me, its not enough whole game is gambling now even combat is gambling, big huge nope for me.

for those saying swap the teams for 12. That worked, 36/36

~~35/36~~

~~didn't clear fast enough for Aventurine~~

~~idk if trying Jingliu would be better though since whole the gamble would be so much worse~~

    We have similar team i barely clear it in 10 Cycles


Team 1 : Kafka, BS, Ruan Mei, Gepard
Team 2 : Acheron, SW, Pela, Luocha


Tips for fighting Aventurine,try saving all of your character ult before the big gamble phase,since your energy is refunded if you win.
    Beat him easily with Jingliu/Bailu/Bronya/Ruan Mei. He can't gamble if he's broken.
    Try alternating those 2 teams, it worked for me! Although I used Kafka and Guinafen for the first node.
    I'd personally swap your DoT along with Acheron into the first half, and go with Jingliu, Ruan Mei, Fu Xuan, and either SW or Pela for the second half.
Dolphin here with e2 acheron so I don't know whether the fight was difficult or not because I played auto and did some other work. So I am curious how bad the fight was. Is hoyo actually making the boss fights harder just to compensate for Acheron powercreep? If it is then it is really bad news for most people.
    Bad news for the game as a whole.
        Yikes. That bad huh. I am curious to see what is the consensus for the current MoC in the upcoming days and whether the bosses are getting out of hand for most people and if they should be nerfed.
At what floor should you be at TL 65? I can't clear more than floor 3. Tbh I give up once one of my characters die.
    I think I was around floor 4-5 at that time? I’m at 7-8 now, I really don’t play meta much lol. Just do however many floors you can, and dw about the rest.
        Yeah, I also forgot that you can just play double sustain to get the no downed characters and then replay the floor with good team to clear in time.
I don't even touch moc 11 lmao, respect to those who complete moc 12 fr
    I'm stuck at MOC 11 lol
Used a total of nine cycles, Seele used 7 and Acheron used 2. The ol' reliable becoming less and less reliable each day. I'd pay money for the dinosaur to fuck off. Also bossventurine didn't have the chance to use that second phase dice gamble coz Acheron just kills him fast.
[deleted]
    
>The previous MOC had Sam which had a giant HP pool which wanted you to deal decent damage to finish within 10 cycles while this one doesn't have such a big pool and is easier to kill

funny you say that when sam only had 1.6 million hp and it keep reducing its own hp when attacking while aventurine has 2 million hp and he doesn't reduce his own hp on any skill. this MoC has higher hp poll ([source](https://homdgcat.wiki/sr/chaos?lang=EN)) while also forcing us to be able to sustain such a big damage. this MoC arguably has the biggest difficulty jump since the first floor 12
Super easy including floor 11, but Cocolia‘s dinosaur on floor 12-1 keeps oneshotting one of my characters. Tried four times, that’s all the time I have rn.
I find this easier to beat than the skill points mechanics from last MoC ngl, tho it’s probably because I don’t have DHIL & Sparkles
My charachters are unbuilt so I’m immune to MoC. Once I get them built tho in probably like a years time I’ll start doing it.
Cocolia's ult killed my Fu Xuan, which I'm pretty sure was the first time my Fu Xuan died in something that wasn't difficulty V Swarm or Gold and Gears. Honestly no clue how it happened, I'm guessing the shield from Texture was on cooldown and she was close to 50% hp.

Also somehow it took me 5 whole cycles to kill Cocolia with Jing Yuan S1 and Hanabi S1 (plus Tingyun Fu Xuan)? I haven't needed anywhere close to 5 cycles for Jing Yuan since I pulled Hanabi, so idk what the fuck they've done with Cocolia this MoC lol

I tried Kafka Black Swan Ruan Luocha against Aventurine, but it took me 6-7 cycles. I even got bad RNG with the dices (Black Swan scoring a 4 with her skill on 3 targets, really?) and yet was never even close to dying, but I don't have enough damage. Not having Jingliu still makes the endgame almost impossible to clear if you don't have good relics, and I have neither Jingliu nor good relics. :D

Also very "glad" to see that they put ice weak enemies for Jingliu's rerun while Kafka had to deal with lightning resistant enemies on her rerun. Pull Hoyo's favorite or get fucked, I guess.
I'll tell you when I can do one battle in there without crashing to desktop

I dont play MOC. It's a peaceful life
dude the memory turbulence is straight up horrible, i use kafka team for aventurine and the memory turbulence always cast at the dice phase for aventurine phase 2, 3 TIMES ! that like 30% hp bar.

sorry for bad english
They had to nerf him in story 😭
    He aren't that hard now. I missed to try his pre-nerf fight(

He got Childed fr fr.
honestly I feel he actually hits harder in the story pre-nerf. the bigger problem is how much he stalls in this moc when you only get so many turns to obtain all stars.
People were literally saying he was nerfed specifically for the MOC version on that post though lol, so it seems they were right.
LMFAO 
I feel ur pain buddy 😂
But not as hard as my mom's chancla
    That's the next story boss
Definitely not harder than my mom's slipper 🥲
Xueyi player holy shit
    I love Xueyi's design & play style.  
I have a seele but she dont hit as hard because sad relic rolls 😔.  
Xueyi's easy because she just uses excess thiefs from weekly boss farming
        May I ask how you've built your Xueyi..? As in, the prerequisite stats, her LC, and so on?

I'm not planning on pulling for anybody until Robin and she's a support, so I have room for building another DPS. Xueyi seems genuinely interesting and her animations are amazing, but I have low eidolons on her so I was going to put her off for another time.

Then I saw your clear with her, and it intrigued me enough that I'm now planning to build her too lol.
            https://preview.redd.it/zia2l0eaunuc1.png?width=1602&format=png&auto=webp&s=98050024f0842e3ed7fdc237cf983b3183c163ed

Here's my Xueyi build that I've been cooking for a while now. Cleared the dino floor in 5 cycles without Ruan Mei with Tingyun / Sparkle / Fu Xuan. Ideally you want a Break effect rope, ATK% orb (not quantum DMG) and Crit DMG or Crit Rate body depending on your substats. Herta shop light cone is absolutely the best one for her from the current selection available to her. Quantum 4-set is better but thief set was more easy to find good substats for since I had an abundance of those pieces from farming that cavern + weekly bosses. 

  
ATK% orb is because Xueyi gets a lot of bonus DMG % from break effect so quantum DMG% would just be diminishing value on her. Try to squeeze in as much ATK%, Break effect and Crit substats as possible. I have ATK% boots because I use Sparkle with her so Xueyi can stay low speed very comfortably. Speed boots are a fine option if you have no turn-manipulation supports to use with her. She has fairly low ATK so she benefits from Tingyun's ATK boost quite a bit. I use Inert Salsotto since she's E6 and therefore does follow-up attacks far more often. Before E6 I think Space sealing station, Glamoth or possibly even Rutilant arena is better to use if you have no good Salsotto pieces.
                Thank you very much! I've saved your comment and I'll be referencing it in the future for my build on Xueyi.
            Xueyi needs a lot of stats so it's not easy. avoid Dmg% orb, go for ATK%, Break effect around 150-170, the usual crit values, and speed. You'd have to look at your supports available, if you're running her with Ruan mei, you can go a little less on BE & Spd, but there's a little anti synergy with ruan mei's extra break delay. with sparkle, you can drop speed. and focus on atk% instead.

Xueyi at e6 is so fun
    She's really good against the dino though!

That 2nd team - 3 of them want to use skill every turn 💀
    Doesn't even matter, SP bot Luocha + properly built sparkle can sustain even QQ and DHIL. Sparkle is E2 DHIL level of cheat.
        Didn't know that was possible. My Sparkle is only at 145 something speed, and I'm still sweating trying to provide Skill Points Points for DHIL and Yukong using their skill every turn.
    Sparkle ults every 3 actions so it doesn't matter.
my sparkle also have Bronya's lc because i didn't roll for her sig.
Skill points is infinite lol

First half took 3 cycles, second half took 5.

Aventurine is so annoying to fight. He wastes an entire cycle every time he uses his gambling mechanic.
    I KNOW RIGHT!?

He does his gambling thing *EVERY SINGLE TURN*  which is fucking ludicrous, who the hell approved of this? I played jingliu bronya and ruan mei, and every time i set up all their ults and buffs, Aventurine just said "yeah no" and got me to unleash my planet-destroying attacks to some dice instead.

This boss fight definitely needs some tweaking
        Some good ol' stalling. Genshin players faced this with the Wenut now HSR can experience it.
            That mofo is not in abyss very often right?
                Yeah not a regular luckily. I always suffer when it does though. I have 2 minutes for it generally and I still cut it close to the 7 min mark. It's invulnerable for like 50% of the time iirc?
    What are you feeding your Seele?
        Bronya nudes if she low cycles
            Does silver wolf/bronnie's have the same effect?
    What eidolons and gear are your 5 stars? I'm assuming E6 Pela, Tingyun, and Lynx as well?

I did mine within 10 cycles but had E0S1 Acheron, E0S1 SW, Sweaty Pela, and Trendy Geppy in 1st half; 2nd half was E0S1 Hanabi, E0S0 Jingliu, E0S0 HH, and E1S0 RM
    Can I see your Seele build please
        4 pc Quantum set + 2 pc Glamoth set. 3250 ATK, 81/180 CR/CDMG.

I say Sparkle and Tingyun are more important here. You don’t need to aim for that high amount of crit damage. Just go for crit rate while Sparkle does the rest
            Oh our stats aren't too different ngl
    Wait wtf I used the exact same teams as you (except I used Fu Xuan instead of lynx) and I got the exact same number of cycles, 3 in the first half and 5 in the second
    Fr, it's impossible to do this without luocha lol. I used Acheron 1st half, jL second half and finished with 20 cycles
        Not really no, I used E0S0 Huohuo, E0S0 Jingliu, E0S1 Hanabi, and E1S0 RM for the 2nd half, tho it took me 7 cycles to beat Bossventurine

First half was Acheron E0S1, SW E1S1, Sweaty Pela, and Trendy Geppy in 3 cycles
            Luocha carried me so hard lol. I got unlucky with the dices but his cleanse was key and helped me clear in almost 4 cycles (just touched 5). And I messed up first half with Acheron cause Gallagher and welt were on life support 💀

Specifically needed to use Acheron on Node 2 since her team mates can use AOE and not get fked by Aventurine (I didn't feel like using JL/Bronya/RM/HH). Qingque slams Node 1 anyways.

It felt like it was even more difficult in Stage 11 since I always get killed by Soda Ape >:(
    Madman with not even fully leveled up units.
        what acheron and gamba does to a mf
        Extra 100hp wouldn't change anything. 
            Extra HP and defense! On Tingyun that's like, an extra hit she can take with how squish she is.

Also, for Black Swan that's more damage since it's also Attack...
            nah I survived aventurine coin blast with 112 hp on ting with luocha support.
        What's the point of leveling supports past 75? Their lvl 80 traces in 9/10 cases are useless and 5 levels give barely any stats for required resources.
            Survivability, extra bit always helps.
            they'd take less dmg from the level difference mechanic, otherwise it kinda just looks nice.
            They must have infinite money for that
    Almost using same team. Switch luocha and fu xuan and exchange BS with SW.
        I aren't builded Pela before (guilty as charged), so use Welt instead. He too has DEF-. Only on Ult, tho.  
But IMG break without break is good too.
            "I aren't builded"... My eyes are bleeding... 
    I was using bronya JL pela hh and I was getting obliterated in second phase. This is first major gear check I had to face I feel like.
how did you find jingliu against aventurine? I fear his dice mechanic might cause a waste of turns on the state, I know he gives you energy after it, but what if you run out and the ult only comes when you are already out of the state? You save ult for dices?
    Its why u badly want -1 spd Bronya (or Sparkle) to circumvent losing on dmg turns to come back online faster and also hypercarry buffs to implode him outside his dice phases.

Or Tingyun+Huohuo it and just almost never leave enhance state…
        my experience with ting and bronya -1 is that I have to skill twice with ting in a row leaving me with skp issues for next cycle (I don't have sparkle) I could use pela for def ahred but my acheron might want her too in half 1
    You really want Bronya / Sparkle, because I think a key mechanic is just wailing on Aventurine outside the gamble and breaking him at least once. Bronya was also useful to get Jingliu back into the Syzygy state during the gamble mode.
This MOC is definitely a pure sustain check rather than dps obecause Aventurine does a stupid amount of dmg and has annoying CC Goodluck to the people who have been skipping the limited sustains cuz this will be rough for them
    Or you can permabreak him with Ruan Mei and Jingliu 135+Bronya 134 wombo combo
        people who dont have limited sustain units and ruanmei D:
    My 50% ERes Nat and 70% ERes Lynx came in kinda clutch.
    Lynx seems to contribute more compared to other healers maybe unless it's Luocha.

I even need to bench Fuxuan in favor Lynx in Adven fight since the guy deals too much damage for Fu to sustain.
        Yeah i was surprised my fu xuan actually struggled against him lol
    Ghallager kept things very comfy for my team.

Elemental weakness was all messed up because I don't have a good ice dps. But JY got the job done as always.
    Except for Luocha and Fu Xuan I have everyone else you've used, might try it later
        Could be rough, Aventurine is a big sustain check
    Who should i replace the likes of Ruan Mei, Topaz and Fu Xuan. I have all in the setups other than those 3.

Bit similar except I move ruan mei to Jingliu side instead, since I find Kafka BS + sampo or gui is good enough for 1 or 2 cycle clear. Didn’t expect Aventurine to be so tough tbh, maybe if I swap Bailu and Huohuo there I can shave off 1 or 2 cycles.
    i had luocha in part 2 and i got creamed
        Same team (With Luocha) and it was pretty straight forward. I'm pretty sure Bronya and Ruan Mei have HP or Def Orbs though and maybe defensive armor too. Luocha might also have a defensive orb. 

Comfort > an extra CD sub roll.
Fucking shit, i have the exact same units but i still can't do it!!! 
Broo, could you share your build?
    Refer to Prdywyn Endgame stats, I follow it basically. Sig LC on Kafka, Jingliu & Black Swan.

One thing I’ll note is during Aventurine’s gamba, I make sure Huohuo healed everyone to full.
I have only 4 (JL, RM, Geppy and TY) of those, and only 2 (JL&RM) actually built.

[Acheron team 1 cycled first half + Jingliu 3 cycled Aventurine.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1040520426046111754/1229330334924148746/image.png?ex=662f4a17&is=661cd517&hm=4888f3544573f2ad92b2cf7c3044eb8012d1e22d61323a1703ec65f226eb2b34&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)

I think as long as you time your aoe and breaks to avoid getting gamba troll on the 2nd half, you can save quite a few cycles. First half I found breaking the new dino fast helps a lot with clear time as well.

The most time-consuming thing for me unironically is resetting on 1st half since the enemies keep focusing Kafka or SW instead of Fire TB...I legit reset like 20+ times maybe more just so that the mobs on wave 1 focus fire TB, my Nihility units (especially Kafka) are the new Tingyun.
    How did you 3-cycled Aven with JL? Is yours E1? It still took me 5 cycles with some good RNG on my side, otherwise it would definitely take one more cycle.
        > How did you 3-cycled Aven with JL? Is yours E1? It still took me 5 cycles with some good RNG on my side, otherwise it would definitely take one more cycle.

My Jingliu is E0S1. Ruan Mei is E1 so that might have been the reason, cuz her E1 gives 20% def ignore.

Believe it or not , this bs setup worked for me. It seems like something that could never work but it did even without any weaknesses on the second half .

    For some reason I can't post text along with an image. Anyway, QQ with Sparkle and Fu Xuan activates the 3 quantum bonus andbl Ruan Mei helps break the purple dinosaur fast. It's a 3 cycle clear.

Then side 2... not the best team but it's a 4 cycle clear for Acheron. Luocha is literally just a healbot with no synergy with Acheron. Would have preferred to use Gepard with Trend but he kept losing his bet and getting imprisoned and couldn't maintain his shield lol.

Another team I used, this one was 22 turns left.

All my stats are basically the recommended stats on prydwen. LCs are either Signature or their BiS 4\*.
Same here. Aventurine’s gambling mechanic wastes your turns a lot
was coasting through the lower floors with ease, Aventurine then held me up for 3 hours. unbalanced it is
For real, i beat stage 1 with only 2 turn

Stage 2 take me 8 turn...
Is he that annoying to face? Cause I had fun against his boss form in the story pre-nerf. And I was sad that I couldn't face him repeatedly anymore so this sounds like good news.
    Still a good fight, but I imagine the turn limit combined with his incredible tankiness is going to frustrate many, many people.
        Yeah that's probably true. I guess I'll find out soon lol.
    That dice face waste time+he's tanky af+without proper sustain his attacks are nuke+if your unlucky on dice phase good luck
Yeah no kidding, I was suprised how easy moc11 was (autoed it with only taking 4 or 5 cycles) only see zero chances of 10 cycling moc12 for the first time since fu release
I might have to double-check it, but I believe you can trigger the stage effect on his dice. Which does... ***nothing***.

For example, I got into his 2nd phase and had a few hits on him, he was at maybe 93%? health. He whips out the set of 4 dice, I use my abilities on it, I see the stage-effect animation trigger. A couple turns later when the dice go away, I look at his HP and... 93%.

I usually struggle a lot w/ MoC but I managed to get up to Floor 11 with three stars without too much issue. But I'm not sure if I'm even going to try and clear Floor 12 because it seems like the Aventurine boss is gonna be a huge pain to deal with if you have to time your attacks so perfectly that his constantly-spammed dice skill doesn't act like a giant shield for him.
Really giving me MOC-onal damage
Aventurine is special in that it gives an instant Ult instead of Energy Refill. So unlike other sources such as the TV, he actually recharges Acheron.
    Basically, functions just like Erudition path in SU
    Let's. Fucking. Go.
    Wait the TV doesn't recharge Acheron? Brain in a Vat works so I figured the TVs would just give Acheron 2 or 3 bars for her ult.

~~(Correct me if I'm wrong but I think Auspicious Star works too)~~ I have been corrected
        The TV doesn’t work, no. Neither does Huohuo or Tingyun’s Ult. They refills Energy, but don’t immediate max it out.

Not sure about Auspicious Star (I don’t actually have Acheron) but I believe it refills Energy so it doesn’t work with Acheron.
Yup it does
    Holy baby
Till floor Floor 11 pretty easy, floor 12 is a tank check, aventurine does crazy damage plus gacha dice or buffs and nerfs.
    https://preview.redd.it/1aj058pz8kuc1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f4d8ba5c5fa96e291cf972f88c1d5e1c0ebd417

My Gepard can't sustain enough against Aventurine. One of my Nihility queens keeps dying. Bailu was enough though.
        Wtf is skill points on your first team ha ha ha.
            Positive, negative, neutral, technically negative but you won't be using her skill often due to slow Acheron since she's just ult botting off the DoTs.
                Lightning lord Acheron for real. Even better since there's no JingYuan holding her back (by being cc'ed)
            Skill points are enough since the fight is over after 1-2 cycles. My Gepard is speedy(142) for SP generation. Kafka(160+) BS(142)

Aventurine took 8+ turns lmao
            The mommy team (Kafka Swan Acheron Mei) has always been about overcharging Acheron so hard that her own skill becomes optional. He's running a trend tank over RM even.

Your actual turns matter little on this squad. It's just Acheron ult spam from trend procs, swan cards and kafka FUAs.
Wait, Bailu is meta again? Let's goooo.
Did you have any trouble with Aventurine's dice eating the stage effect damage? I haven't fought him much yet but when I did a couple times, I think I noticed that if the stage damage effect triggered during the 4-dice round, the dice would take the "damage" and Aventurine would be left unharmed. So it was a huge loss of DPS for me because I've been relying on the stage effect pretty heavily this MoC, and I'm curious if others had the same issue and how they dealt with it.
    Yeah it messed up my rotation. The only reason I can finish this one in 6 cycles is because I let Bronya died and Bailu revived her, so I don't have to use any skill point. Need to be careful when using JL ult too. Overall not a very fun boss.
Honestly though I've felt Bailu was underrated for a long time (not that she is better than the limited 5 stars, but people saying Lynx is better were imo capping, after I got Bailu it made content so much easier compared to when I had Lynx), but yeah she's actually great for this fight and her passive is such a lifesaver as it's so easy for someone to randomly die.
Indeed. Also went up from 5 to 7 cycles for me. 4 cycles for Aventurine alone with my strongest team (Dot), which only needed like 1 cycle last MoC.
Same lmao
ayo same
With RM and Sparkle he will do quite good in the first half of MoC 12, especially considering that RM isn’t as good vs aventurine. 

It’s kinda just extremely uncomfortable MoC. Enemies have just absurd amount of debuffs and toughness, so it just feels bad.
    The worst one tbh. DHIL is pretty much useless in the first half and I don't have another DD and RM so no way I'll be able to close it with 3 stars.

Aventurine is easy though. Only these shitty shield dynos are insanely chunky.
        Actually, if you happen to have Xueyi, it’s a rare MoC where she feels really good to play. QQ also works somewhat good. 

My Dan is E2, and I cleared with him in 4 cycles (could’ve been 3 tbh, I got a bit too greedy with the first wave.) And I managed to do 3 cycle with Xueyi with a somewhat mid build. And mind you, I kinda have skill issue, lol.

I think second half gave me more trouble, as I lack any premium sustain. With Gepard, my Black Swan had just 80 hp left when I was done. That dice encounter is kinda too tight, lack of Fu Xuan really makes it hard.
            E2 DHIL slaps because you get an additional turn after the ultimate. My DHIL is E0 only, so he is kind of useless.

Like, the devs really optimized the last floor for only a few five-star characters (JY, DoT, follow-up), and it's sad.

I dropped this game after SW's release and just recently returned just before 2.0. So, no good time for me.
                I know, I brought up that mine is E2 just to highlight how good Xueyi is in current first half.

But yeah, without E2 it’s rough. It’s not even about his damage, it’s about amount of break he does. Thought I ran Sparkle, SW and lynx for Iamgainaty weakness on cocolia, but I think that Dino is the real problem, it has more toughness than a boss(?) for some reason?? And it’s again not about damage you do, it’s about your sustain. Lynx is not enough until you consistently break, since Dino just deals absurd amount of damage. Overall, this new elite is kinda overtuned. They REALLY want you to have a good breaker.
                    It's also about damage. My DHIL, who is 80/160, deals 100k damage to Aventurine (+Sparkle). Since it's less than 10%, it will take at least 10 more turns to kill him (over two phases). That is already enough not to get three stars.

My Acheron, though, takes two to four turns to defeat Aventurine.
                        Because he has imaginary res… That’s why I suggested him only for the first half.
            Yeah QQ is fine, she cleaned up side 1 in 3 cycles and my e0s1 acheron cleaned up side 2 in 4 cycles.
            I’ve been swapping my E2DHIL around trying to figure out where he should go, what was your strategy for each half?
                First half I went with E2 Herta lc DHIL, E1 sparkle with DDD, tutorial SW and lynx. Weakness implant on whatever doesn’t have img weakness and just break it. Focus on dino more, since getting rid of it ASAP is the key. Actually, SW could’ve been replaced with RM or Tingyun for even faster Dino break, but I haven’t done multiple attempts, Cocolia might’ve felt like a joke explicitly due to addition of img weakness (she was banished into shadow realm practically with being mostly broken)

  
Second half I just brute forced with E0S1 Kafka, E1 EotP BS, E1 S3 MotP RM and Geppie.  Like, absolutely breaindead strat (I wonder why my BS had 80 Hp at the end)
                    thanks! i don’t have rm, gepard, or sw, but i do have luocha and bailu lol hopefully i can make something work!
                        Luocha for the first side and bailu for the second and you shouldn't struggle that much. If anything, it should be a bit easier from survivability point 
That Dino really counters Hypercarry due to its big ass weakness shield (which kinda demand RM) and short window to burst him down (and long ass stalling from that weakness breaking)
This MOC 12 has less imaginary weak enemies than the previous one. 

Node 1 have two meme dinasaurs weak to IL element but their mechanic(receive less damage before weakness broken) is really annoying for hyppercarry comps and there's also mama cocolia with a huge burst if you don't break or kill her fast enough. 

Node 2's 1st phase is alright with the Ascended and IPC senior staff BUT 2nd phase is just suffering for imaginary damage dealers since Aventurine boss has high img res.
Well i used him first half and he cleared in 3 cycle the 2nd half i use acheron and she cleared in 1 cycle
https://preview.redd.it/1dmtmobf2nuc1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=54f1d160ca7fd312bf7a071eca2b38a602bcc542

He's till good with Ruan Mei
    What about without Ruan Mei?
        Slow... at first, I pair him with SW to break the Dino, but it takes too long, and I don't have sparkle. Mine is atk boots e0s1 DHIL
Yeah, I don't think I can beat it either. Similar situation in that my best built dps is DHIL and I don't have Jingliu or the DoT characters. I used him on side one it took him 6 cycles. I decided to pull and build Acheron and Gallagher late, so her build is kind crap and she can't help yet. My Xueyi or Seele could maybe do better on that side one but I don't really have a dps for the ridiculous Aventurine boss anyway so I'm just gonna give up without even clearing 12 and take my 33 star clear.
I used mine in the first half with Tingyun, RM and Sparkle (mine is E2 DHIL). I had to use him since he's my only DPS who can clear fast. Though it took me multiple retries due to dying. I used my Acheron team in second half.
I have invested heavily in my DHIL team, so I can only speak from my experience.   

&#x200B;

Not sure how his E0 performance would be, but I used my E2S2 ERR DHIL for everything (except for MOC 9 because I wanted to use Jingliu at least once). He seems fine if you can dedicate his best supports for him. Without the eidolons on the supports he probably just clears 1-2 cycle slower.   

It was definitely tempting to take Sparkle away from him for Acheron though.

&#x200B;

Just for fun, I tried to brute force DHIL against Aventurine as well. It took 2 cycles to clear that fight.

I managed to clear it with DHIL first half and Argenti second half. I skipped Kafka, Acheron, and Jingliu too, so it was definitely a struggle. 

https://preview.redd.it/ad2f4jsjaquc1.png?width=1922&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cff7faffbbc1eeb3f9bfdb2ef80e03bb27c96b7
eidolons and 5 star LCs definitely are a factor, but resources are also extremely relevant. I don't buy top ups like the whales but I did buy every BP since day one and I often forget how much more resources I get compared to f2p players
    I still think the biggest issue is people avoiding relics and investing too much into traces and especially levels. Lvl 10 traces and sometimes lvl 80 characters are luxuries that should only be pursued once your relics are up to par. Lvl. 8 traces (or lower for unimportant ones) and lvl. 70-75 (for supports at least) work fine before then.

It's also possible people hyperinvest too early into their favorite chars without budgeting time to farm relics for new DPSs.
        people are only doing that because relic farming has awful rng, while traces are guaranteed progress. its better to spend 1000 energy with raised traces than 1000 energy with zero useful relics
it's not whales lol, any f2p day 1 player should be able to clear with plenty of leeway unless they avoided pulling most meta units
Realistically, Luocha is still insanely cracked with his 0 sp usage and absurd healing, I think people mainly hate on him as every other 5\* limited sustain just does stuff other than heal. Fu Xuan has the CC prevention and crit damage increase, HuoHuo has the energy and attack increases on her ult and even better cleanses, and aventurine has his ult debuff and subdps capabilities. Luocha just has buff removal from his ult and no other damage capabilities, it just seems more worth to pull for a character that helps with clearing speed and such.
I may have to use rm instead of pela on my JL bronya team. I was getting massacred in phase two.
Bailu is also great for the Aventurine fight. She put in a shift for me and it's so easy for him to randomly kill someone where you can't do anything about it.
I got massacred against the dino with Luocha. Honestly atp, preservation seems to be better at sustaining than healers. Managed to clear first half in 3 cycle wih Acheron but Aven took 5 with Jingliu.
pls howw my argenti is so mid TwT and hes the only one i can use on second half (curse you 70% img res)
    I also used Argenti on the second team. I had 6 turns on the Aventurine boss and I was really cutting it close and had to retry a few times. This was my team.   
- Hanya with 179 spd, Planetary Rendezvouz s2 and Penacony set  
- Tingyun with DDD s3  
- Gepard with 135 spd and 3800 def  
- Argenti with sig LC, 2881 atk, 59.3% crit rate, 163.7% crit damage and 128 spd
may i know your teams? i was debating using argenti on the second half
    He’s definitely being hyper carried: I have Bronya E0S1, Sparkle E0S1 and Fu Xuan. So really he is being ‘carried’ by the supports, but whatever it takes to use who I love 🥺 (I also have Black Swan/Kafka/Acheron as my other team to carry my turn values). These are my only teams though, so I have to make them work
wait, don't adventurine kidnap jing and force her to waste your stack?
    You gotta gamble that that possibility doesent happen
    Hey there, trailblazer! Just so you know, Aventurine's name doesn't have the D after his first letter! :]

    Thats why It took me 21 tries to get it Perfectly,i also need Jingliu in her State to Hit 3 dice fill her ULT up
You can get away without sustain in 1st half if you are lucky. But that's frustrating
    The dino is annoying though
        Yea very annoying. I was pretty close to no sustain but figured out that it's not worth it
3-staring MoC 12 phase 2 with M7 is crazy. How did you build her?
    the imprint this time you can bruteforce it simply by keep attacking to get it to 6 stack and explode for free 150k dmg. make follow up very good at this moc. was thinking doing the same but clear it already with DoT team
    Probably a regular tank build. She's just a shield/taunt bot for Clara anyways.
For an offensive sustain March 7th works pretty well. Her follow-up attacks count to the stage effect, which is a huge plus.

My personal issue is just that I can't really experiment with teams as easily since I have to get through the other floor as well. I don't have much of an issue clearing the Cocolia floor but it takes a fair bit of time. So it takes a while just to get to Aventurine, and that means if I want to tweak my team I need to go all the way back to the start >.>

But we still have a month left for this cycle of course, so I'm not too worried. I have Acheron but she's not well-built yet so I didn't even use her against Aventurine, and since I got Argenti I might just try and focus on using him instead. There's still time to adjust teams and build characters further. And I'm saying this as someone that didn't even get past Floor 8 until last MoC, lol
No ruan mei, no jingliu, no sparkle, no DoT 5*

Me: Guess I’ll die
    You’re right, except for Ruan Mei, I pulled her while trying to get Xueyi
        Well, at least she is amazing and complements Xueyi perfectly
            I don’t have Xueyi
                ...oh

RIP!

Here's hoping you get her on Standard Banner!!
                    Hopefully, I’m afraid ghallager’s E2 was too valuable
                        tbh I ended up getting both Luocha and Acheron just because I needed E6 Gallagher... I actually like both! Too bad I probably won't be able to pull anything else of note in the next few patches :(
                            I wanted luocha but the wrong imaginary unit came 😭
                                I... I have E2 Welt iirc... :(
        I pulled her trying to get e6 March lol. Got her not twice but four times :’D
            Xueyi or Ruan Mei? Both are very possible and very terrifying
                RM (it took me 250 pulls, I won the 50/50 4 times, and lost once to Himeko. I don’t think I’ll ever be this unlucky lucky again. I was literally considering getting Blade bc she kept coming when I wanted March.)
                    Hey, at least your support is busted
                        Agreed, I used her with Himeko in one of the floors today, and I was surprised at the 40k burst damage from Himeko. I forgot that my RM was e3, so it’s probably partly due to that.
My only sustain and healers are the ones you get for free lol 💀
    Other than Ghallager, same
Username checks out

Nah but for real good luck, I always like to see off-meta MoC clears so I hope you can make it happen!
It’s out for Asia server. For NA it’ll be out in around 2 hours
Maybe because you don't have her sig LC, pearls LC, and a sustain that can debuff. Every 1 thing you lack here draws you away from Acheron ulting. This is literally my alt account's situation that is why it takes years for Acheron to ult. Can finish 1st side within 5 turns but the 2nd side... damn.
    I am like 30 pulls away from E2 but I'll just have to wait for rerun now cause I am out of pulls. I don't even have sig LC

My only other nihility are Welt and Pela, I could probably clear faster if welt had more damage but rn only Acheron does damage in my team
        Black Swan does good amount of AOE damage too, but my other team needs her for this MOC.
            I don't even have black swan lol
Omg its tomato from genshin impact!
 *The D goes to somewhere else* >:(
    He gets the knight of beauty special treatment. ;)
I didn't consider how fun Argenti would be against Aventurine. Too bad I can't just casually challenge the Aventurine side first to test it cause I do not want to thru a whole first half for it. (I really wish we'd have the option to pick which side to challenge first, is there even a reason why we shouldn't be able to?)
cuz they want Misha to shine, he’s the “budget” dps option here. He even has a Blast skill that doesnt need an “Enhanced” State to use, and it charges his Luggage Lord stacks (winning the gamble gives him free Ult to use too)
It will be too funny if some dps in the coming patches will make Aventurine boss look like a joke.
    Boothill is typed well but not sure how he'd do against dice.
Even sw? Damn that's some luck.
    Yeah Aventurine drew a 6, her burst somehow landed a 6 and her basic did a 3, never been so glad lmao
        I thought it's only one action then it resets? Like you have to gamble for every attack
            Nope it's cumulative per gamble, for example if SW has burst she have 2 dice, if Pela has burst 5, and 7 for Acheron but I never keep her burst so only 3 from skill.
I see another fellow March enjoyer. I used that exact same team for Aventurine. Genuinely think March is one of the best sustainers for Acheron if the rest of the team is optimised.
    Really enjoy her tactical playstyle and that tiny bit of healing from E6 even tho SP intensive. I also often choose her than other healers for SU run as solo sustain. Her freeze came in clutch too during Aventurine fight just now.
i couldnt pass the first half without anyone dying half of the time because barney always attacks twice and sometimes the attacks land on the same character multiple times
As long as you have 5* supports, you can comfortably clear with most DPSs. Aventurine is a bit harder as you'd also need a good sustain on top of that, but if you can get by the dice mechanic with AoE attacks, you should be fine.
    I'm glad if that's the case then! I was also malding because, for me at least, I know it is different for everyone depending on your roster, last moc(s) and current (?) pf became suddenly harder and seemed to heavily favor meta dps owners and/or big spenders who pull for everyone in the game and can afford to hard pity every time if they got unlucky,  I mean it's normal, but it seemed too much. (not having JL in the ice weakness everywhere period was already harsh too, now it will be Acheron time, at least I have a good King Yuan so I will be able to do something, but he's sadly not quite on the same level)
Obviously you will never face any difficulties if you have jl and acheron with eidolons, but it is an extreme case.
        The games favours people who pull e0s0 for every character and doesn't go further, tbf.
Same, dont have jl or acheron, or DOT char
Can only *35, it sucks seeing those 'required' char to fullstar, ig ill leave it at *35 :') 
Tried to use dhil, meh 
The only lightning i have is jingyuan😂 seems impossible
    Yep, we'll stay strong dude. Everyone, including us, who is clearing 34 to 36 stars, depending on the moc, without JL and Acheron is already a chad.
Never did and never will require a meta dps. The supporting cast is much more important 
nah with ur characters it looks doable to me, try putting rm on first half instead of tingyun since break is way more important on first half, surely u have pela built cuz she would help acheron a lot on 2nd half

this memory turbulence gives a **guaranteed debuff for any attack** when its under 6 stacks, so u can save some sp on welt there, comes pretty handy for acheron

although not very comfy, i did it with this. (acheron is e0 gnsw)

ok, i got it. thx to your comment i continued to try. i made a couple more different teams, but this ones were the best choices i could go with, since the main goal was to keep damaging toughness bars of the enemies and prevent them from debuffing my team. 

still, rng was mad crazy. at one point Dino decided to focus all of his attacks from additional action on squishy Bronya and almost killed her which led to a natural restart. though such surprises did not happen often and overall survivability was fine. like 1 time for each side — only from new attempts there were 2 such cases and the second one, which happened on the second side, i did not have to restart.

dealing with elites on both sides was also fine. I concentrated 75% of the damage on more tanky ones (Fridge and Cocolia with Senior staff and none other than Aventurine) and relied on memory turbulence to help finish everyone off except Aventurine obviously. Acheron ultimate was last action on a last cycle and i couldn't afford to lose any cycles with second phase of the boss.  

probably yesterday i was not so interested in understanding the mechanics, but once i read them again and tried to thoughtfully play the game everything worked out.
Don't worry about not being able to push the higher stages like 11 and 12 but just attempting the lower level ones are a good source of free jades and also gives you the currency to buy lightcones from the shop.
You're missing out on a lot of free jades and other materials
Ya don't have to do it all nor fully star it,just do anything you are able to,it's free pulls,if you get stuck at x stage u still get the jades from the stages u cleared
u aren't missing out on a lot of free jade at most u can get is 720 which is only 4 pulls per MOC or PF. as long as u try to collect as much as u can u aren't missing much
Up until floor 10 its piss easy, literally just free gem. You can skip floor 11 and 12 if you want.
Update, I have now played MoC 12.

Holy shit. This might be what finally defeats me.
Congrats!

In all fairness, acheron is basically a rainbow dps due to how she works (res pen plus all type toughness break), so that's your justification anyway!
Do you have her LC? I'm the same in that I had all the lightning DPS's but Acheron would be very universal for all content.
    Yes, barely had enough to get to pity on thr LC banner and won, thank God. I had not even a single copy of GNSW with a full year of play time and all the pulls on this banner. So it was all or nothing. Would have been nice if I ever won a character 50:50 tho, this was my 6th loss in a row. Really had some hopes and dreams that this would be my time and get an eidolon or two, but nope. 200 pulls in. Still only a single acheron. Can't wait to one day get her e2 one day!
There are two notable things about Aventurine boss


-He has an aoe attack that can either reduce your energy or delay your action.

-When he activates his skill, he set a random number that range from 2 to 9, your characters will have to hit the dices. If your character gets a bigger number than his, they will get their ultimate up, if not they will get hit. One character in phase 1, your whole team in phase 2.
    Ty
    in phase 1, is his targetting random or position based?

getting QQ kidnapped is the worst feeling, you either lose a shiton of sp of lose the gamba
        Gamba for the gamba
    is it 2 to 9? in phase 2 he always pull 7 to 9 which sometimes even if your unit use blast skill it is still less than him, crazy
        For phase 2, he has a rigged die from 4 to 9, with 16%, 20% and 40% chance to hit 7, 8, 9 respectively.

The odds to beat his dice rolls are about 50% for 2 hits, 85% for 3 hits and 97% for 4 hits.
who's aDventurine?
    Someone who likes adventures, duh
    i dunno, probably a friend of archeron and inhibitor lunae
What is even that second team
    Already tried a lot of combination like pela + sw + archeron/sw + sparkle + archeron and such

but somehow this is the only way for me(my archeron is f2p, no sig lc) 

Aventurine is pretty tanky and has untargetable turn, so i need to find a way to finish it as fast as i can hence 3 dps
        The 3 dps makes sense since you can spam Ults if you win the gambles.
What lc does he have?
    Well, his signature..

I pull it because i need another dps lol
Aventurine (character) sounds like he'd be pretty fun against Aventurine (boss) because of the AoE attacks leading to the follow ups
And jing liu
    If you have argenti he absolutely mogs aventurine since you can get his ult from the gamble pretty often
Yeah, the dino may be scary, but if you don't weakness break cocolia then it can be brutal.
    honestly, the dino came across more annoying than scary... due to the fact that i only have kafka to break its weakness

but yeah, cocolia really is brutal
Bailu, Serval, March7, what a Chad line up!
My first couple tries I tried with "everyone pass the gamba" team of Pela, Blade, Jingliu, Luocha.

But your supports don't need to win the gamba as long as they survive the hit. Ruan Mei, Bronya, Jingliu, Luocha was a much better team even though Ruan Mei and Bronya lost every gamble (and during Bronya's turn I usually didn't even hit dice, just skilled Jingliu to get her stacks up).
Lol

What teams??
    kafka hyeprcarry, Acheron Hypercarry
Pela isn't a DPS so yeah that definitely makes sense. 
I didn't have Huohuo and my Bronya isn't properly equipped yet, so I swapped them out for Lynx and Sparkle respectively. Managed to clear level 12 in exactly 10 turns, thanks.
If you happen to have argenti he clears faster than JL against aventurine because he can spam his level 2 Ult a lot

The teams I used

We have similar team i barely clear it in 10 Cycles


Team 1 : Kafka, BS, Ruan Mei, Gepard
Team 2 : Acheron, SW, Pela, Luocha


Tips for fighting Aventurine,try saving all of your character ult before the big gamble phase,since your energy is refunded if you win.
Beat him easily with Jingliu/Bailu/Bronya/Ruan Mei. He can't gamble if he's broken.
Try alternating those 2 teams, it worked for me! Although I used Kafka and Guinafen for the first node.
I'd personally swap your DoT along with Acheron into the first half, and go with Jingliu, Ruan Mei, Fu Xuan, and either SW or Pela for the second half.
Bad news for the game as a whole.
    Yikes. That bad huh. I am curious to see what is the consensus for the current MoC in the upcoming days and whether the bosses are getting out of hand for most people and if they should be nerfed.
I think I was around floor 4-5 at that time? I’m at 7-8 now, I really don’t play meta much lol. Just do however many floors you can, and dw about the rest.
    Yeah, I also forgot that you can just play double sustain to get the no downed characters and then replay the floor with good team to clear in time.
I'm stuck at MOC 11 lol

>The previous MOC had Sam which had a giant HP pool which wanted you to deal decent damage to finish within 10 cycles while this one doesn't have such a big pool and is easier to kill

funny you say that when sam only had 1.6 million hp and it keep reducing its own hp when attacking while aventurine has 2 million hp and he doesn't reduce his own hp on any skill. this MoC has higher hp poll ([source](https://homdgcat.wiki/sr/chaos?lang=EN)) while also forcing us to be able to sustain such a big damage. this MoC arguably has the biggest difficulty jump since the first floor 12
He aren't that hard now. I missed to try his pre-nerf fight(

He got Childed fr fr.
That's the next story boss
I love Xueyi's design & play style.  
I have a seele but she dont hit as hard because sad relic rolls 😔.  
Xueyi's easy because she just uses excess thiefs from weekly boss farming
    May I ask how you've built your Xueyi..? As in, the prerequisite stats, her LC, and so on?

I'm not planning on pulling for anybody until Robin and she's a support, so I have room for building another DPS. Xueyi seems genuinely interesting and her animations are amazing, but I have low eidolons on her so I was going to put her off for another time.

Then I saw your clear with her, and it intrigued me enough that I'm now planning to build her too lol.
        https://preview.redd.it/zia2l0eaunuc1.png?width=1602&format=png&auto=webp&s=98050024f0842e3ed7fdc237cf983b3183c163ed

Here's my Xueyi build that I've been cooking for a while now. Cleared the dino floor in 5 cycles without Ruan Mei with Tingyun / Sparkle / Fu Xuan. Ideally you want a Break effect rope, ATK% orb (not quantum DMG) and Crit DMG or Crit Rate body depending on your substats. Herta shop light cone is absolutely the best one for her from the current selection available to her. Quantum 4-set is better but thief set was more easy to find good substats for since I had an abundance of those pieces from farming that cavern + weekly bosses. 

  
ATK% orb is because Xueyi gets a lot of bonus DMG % from break effect so quantum DMG% would just be diminishing value on her. Try to squeeze in as much ATK%, Break effect and Crit substats as possible. I have ATK% boots because I use Sparkle with her so Xueyi can stay low speed very comfortably. Speed boots are a fine option if you have no turn-manipulation supports to use with her. She has fairly low ATK so she benefits from Tingyun's ATK boost quite a bit. I use Inert Salsotto since she's E6 and therefore does follow-up attacks far more often. Before E6 I think Space sealing station, Glamoth or possibly even Rutilant arena is better to use if you have no good Salsotto pieces.
            Thank you very much! I've saved your comment and I'll be referencing it in the future for my build on Xueyi.
        Xueyi needs a lot of stats so it's not easy. avoid Dmg% orb, go for ATK%, Break effect around 150-170, the usual crit values, and speed. You'd have to look at your supports available, if you're running her with Ruan mei, you can go a little less on BE & Spd, but there's a little anti synergy with ruan mei's extra break delay. with sparkle, you can drop speed. and focus on atk% instead.
https://preview.redd.it/3porm7ftznuc1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e74e9b8d9ccd36a2103bd0731c285e4917df84bf

Xueyi at e6 is so fun
She's really good against the dino though!
I'd be a Xueyi player if I could get some goddamn eidolons

Same. Although my retries were in the 1 at half cause welt kept dying
Doesn't even matter, SP bot Luocha + properly built sparkle can sustain even QQ and DHIL. Sparkle is E2 DHIL level of cheat.
    Didn't know that was possible. My Sparkle is only at 145 something speed, and I'm still sweating trying to provide Skill Points Points for DHIL and Yukong using their skill every turn.
Sparkle ults every 3 actions so it doesn't matter.
my sparkle also have Bronya's lc because i didn't roll for her sig.
Skill points is infinite lol
I KNOW RIGHT!?

He does his gambling thing *EVERY SINGLE TURN*  which is fucking ludicrous, who the hell approved of this? I played jingliu bronya and ruan mei, and every time i set up all their ults and buffs, Aventurine just said "yeah no" and got me to unleash my planet-destroying attacks to some dice instead.

This boss fight definitely needs some tweaking
    Some good ol' stalling. Genshin players faced this with the Wenut now HSR can experience it.
        That mofo is not in abyss very often right?
            Yeah not a regular luckily. I always suffer when it does though. I have 2 minutes for it generally and I still cut it close to the 7 min mark. It's invulnerable for like 50% of the time iirc?
What are you feeding your Seele?
    Bronya nudes if she low cycles
        Does silver wolf/bronnie's have the same effect?
What eidolons and gear are your 5 stars? I'm assuming E6 Pela, Tingyun, and Lynx as well?

I did mine within 10 cycles but had E0S1 Acheron, E0S1 SW, Sweaty Pela, and Trendy Geppy in 1st half; 2nd half was E0S1 Hanabi, E0S0 Jingliu, E0S0 HH, and E1S0 RM
Can I see your Seele build please
    4 pc Quantum set + 2 pc Glamoth set. 3250 ATK, 81/180 CR/CDMG.

I say Sparkle and Tingyun are more important here. You don’t need to aim for that high amount of crit damage. Just go for crit rate while Sparkle does the rest
        Oh our stats aren't too different ngl
Wait wtf I used the exact same teams as you (except I used Fu Xuan instead of lynx) and I got the exact same number of cycles, 3 in the first half and 5 in the second
Fr, it's impossible to do this without luocha lol. I used Acheron 1st half, jL second half and finished with 20 cycles
    Not really no, I used E0S0 Huohuo, E0S0 Jingliu, E0S1 Hanabi, and E1S0 RM for the 2nd half, tho it took me 7 cycles to beat Bossventurine

First half was Acheron E0S1, SW E1S1, Sweaty Pela, and Trendy Geppy in 3 cycles
        Luocha carried me so hard lol. I got unlucky with the dices but his cleanse was key and helped me clear in almost 4 cycles (just touched 5). And I messed up first half with Acheron cause Gallagher and welt were on life support 💀
Madman with not even fully leveled up units.
    what acheron and gamba does to a mf
    Extra 100hp wouldn't change anything. 
        Extra HP and defense! On Tingyun that's like, an extra hit she can take with how squish she is.

Also, for Black Swan that's more damage since it's also Attack...
        nah I survived aventurine coin blast with 112 hp on ting with luocha support.
    What's the point of leveling supports past 75? Their lvl 80 traces in 9/10 cases are useless and 5 levels give barely any stats for required resources.
        Survivability, extra bit always helps.
        they'd take less dmg from the level difference mechanic, otherwise it kinda just looks nice.
        They must have infinite money for that
Almost using same team. Switch luocha and fu xuan and exchange BS with SW.
    I aren't builded Pela before (guilty as charged), so use Welt instead. He too has DEF-. Only on Ult, tho.  
But IMG break without break is good too.
        "I aren't builded"... My eyes are bleeding... 
I was using bronya JL pela hh and I was getting obliterated in second phase. This is first major gear check I had to face I feel like.
Its why u badly want -1 spd Bronya (or Sparkle) to circumvent losing on dmg turns to come back online faster and also hypercarry buffs to implode him outside his dice phases.

Or Tingyun+Huohuo it and just almost never leave enhance state…
    my experience with ting and bronya -1 is that I have to skill twice with ting in a row leaving me with skp issues for next cycle (I don't have sparkle) I could use pela for def ahred but my acheron might want her too in half 1
You really want Bronya / Sparkle, because I think a key mechanic is just wailing on Aventurine outside the gamble and breaking him at least once. Bronya was also useful to get Jingliu back into the Syzygy state during the gamble mode.
Or you can permabreak him with Ruan Mei and Jingliu 135+Bronya 134 wombo combo
    people who dont have limited sustain units and ruanmei D:
My 50% ERes Nat and 70% ERes Lynx came in kinda clutch.
Lynx seems to contribute more compared to other healers maybe unless it's Luocha.

I even need to bench Fuxuan in favor Lynx in Adven fight since the guy deals too much damage for Fu to sustain.
    Yeah i was surprised my fu xuan actually struggled against him lol
Ghallager kept things very comfy for my team.
Except for Luocha and Fu Xuan I have everyone else you've used, might try it later
    Could be rough, Aventurine is a big sustain check
Who should i replace the likes of Ruan Mei, Topaz and Fu Xuan. I have all in the setups other than those 3.
i had luocha in part 2 and i got creamed
    Same team (With Luocha) and it was pretty straight forward. I'm pretty sure Bronya and Ruan Mei have HP or Def Orbs though and maybe defensive armor too. Luocha might also have a defensive orb. 

Comfort > an extra CD sub roll.
Refer to Prdywyn Endgame stats, I follow it basically. Sig LC on Kafka, Jingliu & Black Swan.

One thing I’ll note is during Aventurine’s gamba, I make sure Huohuo healed everyone to full.
How did you 3-cycled Aven with JL? Is yours E1? It still took me 5 cycles with some good RNG on my side, otherwise it would definitely take one more cycle.
    > How did you 3-cycled Aven with JL? Is yours E1? It still took me 5 cycles with some good RNG on my side, otherwise it would definitely take one more cycle.

My Jingliu is E0S1. Ruan Mei is E1 so that might have been the reason, cuz her E1 gives 20% def ignore.
For some reason I can't post text along with an image. Anyway, QQ with Sparkle and Fu Xuan activates the 3 quantum bonus andbl Ruan Mei helps break the purple dinosaur fast. It's a 3 cycle clear.

Then side 2... not the best team but it's a 4 cycle clear for Acheron. Luocha is literally just a healbot with no synergy with Acheron. Would have preferred to use Gepard with Trend but he kept losing his bet and getting imprisoned and couldn't maintain his shield lol.
Still a good fight, but I imagine the turn limit combined with his incredible tankiness is going to frustrate many, many people.
    Yeah that's probably true. I guess I'll find out soon lol.
That dice face waste time+he's tanky af+without proper sustain his attacks are nuke+if your unlucky on dice phase good luck
Basically, functions just like Erudition path in SU
Let's. Fucking. Go.
Wait the TV doesn't recharge Acheron? Brain in a Vat works so I figured the TVs would just give Acheron 2 or 3 bars for her ult.

~~(Correct me if I'm wrong but I think Auspicious Star works too)~~ I have been corrected
    The TV doesn’t work, no. Neither does Huohuo or Tingyun’s Ult. They refills Energy, but don’t immediate max it out.

Not sure about Auspicious Star (I don’t actually have Acheron) but I believe it refills Energy so it doesn’t work with Acheron.
Holy baby

My Gepard can't sustain enough against Aventurine. One of my Nihility queens keeps dying. Bailu was enough though.
    Wtf is skill points on your first team ha ha ha.
        Positive, negative, neutral, technically negative but you won't be using her skill often due to slow Acheron since she's just ult botting off the DoTs.
            Lightning lord Acheron for real. Even better since there's no JingYuan holding her back (by being cc'ed)
        Skill points are enough since the fight is over after 1-2 cycles. My Gepard is speedy(142) for SP generation. Kafka(160+) BS(142)

Aventurine took 8+ turns lmao
        The mommy team (Kafka Swan Acheron Mei) has always been about overcharging Acheron so hard that her own skill becomes optional. He's running a trend tank over RM even.

Your actual turns matter little on this squad. It's just Acheron ult spam from trend procs, swan cards and kafka FUAs.
Yeah it messed up my rotation. The only reason I can finish this one in 6 cycles is because I let Bronya died and Bailu revived her, so I don't have to use any skill point. Need to be careful when using JL ult too. Overall not a very fun boss.
The worst one tbh. DHIL is pretty much useless in the first half and I don't have another DD and RM so no way I'll be able to close it with 3 stars.

Aventurine is easy though. Only these shitty shield dynos are insanely chunky.
    Actually, if you happen to have Xueyi, it’s a rare MoC where she feels really good to play. QQ also works somewhat good. 

My Dan is E2, and I cleared with him in 4 cycles (could’ve been 3 tbh, I got a bit too greedy with the first wave.) And I managed to do 3 cycle with Xueyi with a somewhat mid build. And mind you, I kinda have skill issue, lol.

I think second half gave me more trouble, as I lack any premium sustain. With Gepard, my Black Swan had just 80 hp left when I was done. That dice encounter is kinda too tight, lack of Fu Xuan really makes it hard.
        E2 DHIL slaps because you get an additional turn after the ultimate. My DHIL is E0 only, so he is kind of useless.

Like, the devs really optimized the last floor for only a few five-star characters (JY, DoT, follow-up), and it's sad.

I dropped this game after SW's release and just recently returned just before 2.0. So, no good time for me.
            I know, I brought up that mine is E2 just to highlight how good Xueyi is in current first half.

But yeah, without E2 it’s rough. It’s not even about his damage, it’s about amount of break he does. Thought I ran Sparkle, SW and lynx for Iamgainaty weakness on cocolia, but I think that Dino is the real problem, it has more toughness than a boss(?) for some reason?? And it’s again not about damage you do, it’s about your sustain. Lynx is not enough until you consistently break, since Dino just deals absurd amount of damage. Overall, this new elite is kinda overtuned. They REALLY want you to have a good breaker.
                It's also about damage. My DHIL, who is 80/160, deals 100k damage to Aventurine (+Sparkle). Since it's less than 10%, it will take at least 10 more turns to kill him (over two phases). That is already enough not to get three stars.

My Acheron, though, takes two to four turns to defeat Aventurine.
                    Because he has imaginary res… That’s why I suggested him only for the first half.
        Yeah QQ is fine, she cleaned up side 1 in 3 cycles and my e0s1 acheron cleaned up side 2 in 4 cycles.
        I’ve been swapping my E2DHIL around trying to figure out where he should go, what was your strategy for each half?
            First half I went with E2 Herta lc DHIL, E1 sparkle with DDD, tutorial SW and lynx. Weakness implant on whatever doesn’t have img weakness and just break it. Focus on dino more, since getting rid of it ASAP is the key. Actually, SW could’ve been replaced with RM or Tingyun for even faster Dino break, but I haven’t done multiple attempts, Cocolia might’ve felt like a joke explicitly due to addition of img weakness (she was banished into shadow realm practically with being mostly broken)

  
Second half I just brute forced with E0S1 Kafka, E1 EotP BS, E1 S3 MotP RM and Geppie.  Like, absolutely breaindead strat (I wonder why my BS had 80 Hp at the end)
                thanks! i don’t have rm, gepard, or sw, but i do have luocha and bailu lol hopefully i can make something work!
                    Luocha for the first side and bailu for the second and you shouldn't struggle that much. If anything, it should be a bit easier from survivability point 
What about without Ruan Mei?
    Slow... at first, I pair him with SW to break the Dino, but it takes too long, and I don't have sparkle. Mine is atk boots e0s1 DHIL
I still think the biggest issue is people avoiding relics and investing too much into traces and especially levels. Lvl 10 traces and sometimes lvl 80 characters are luxuries that should only be pursued once your relics are up to par. Lvl. 8 traces (or lower for unimportant ones) and lvl. 70-75 (for supports at least) work fine before then.

It's also possible people hyperinvest too early into their favorite chars without budgeting time to farm relics for new DPSs.
    people are only doing that because relic farming has awful rng, while traces are guaranteed progress. its better to spend 1000 energy with raised traces than 1000 energy with zero useful relics
I also used Argenti on the second team. I had 6 turns on the Aventurine boss and I was really cutting it close and had to retry a few times. This was my team.   
- Hanya with 179 spd, Planetary Rendezvouz s2 and Penacony set  
- Tingyun with DDD s3  
- Gepard with 135 spd and 3800 def

He’s definitely being hyper carried: I have Bronya E0S1, Sparkle E0S1 and Fu Xuan. So really he is being ‘carried’ by the supports, but whatever it takes to use who I love 🥺 (I also have Black Swan/Kafka/Acheron as my other team to carry my turn values). These are my only teams though, so I have to make them work
You gotta gamble that that possibility doesent happen
Hey there, trailblazer! Just so you know, Aventurine's name doesn't have the D after his first letter! :]

*The D goes to a different place*

Thats why It took me 21 tries to get it Perfectly,i also need Jingliu in her State to Hit 3 dice fill her ULT up
The dino is annoying though
    Yea very annoying. I was pretty close to no sustain but figured out that it's not worth it
the imprint this time you can bruteforce it simply by keep attacking to get it to 6 stack and explode for free 150k dmg. make follow up very good at this moc. was thinking doing the same but clear it already with DoT team
Probably a regular tank build. She's just a shield/taunt bot for Clara anyways.
You’re right, except for Ruan Mei, I pulled her while trying to get Xueyi
    Well, at least she is amazing and complements Xueyi perfectly
        I don’t have Xueyi
            ...oh

RIP!

Here's hoping you get her on Standard Banner!!
                Hopefully, I’m afraid ghallager’s E2 was too valuable
                    tbh I ended up getting both Luocha and Acheron just because I needed E6 Gallagher... I actually like both! Too bad I probably won't be able to pull anything else of note in the next few patches :(
                        I wanted luocha but the wrong imaginary unit came 😭
                            I... I have E2 Welt iirc... :(
    I pulled her trying to get e6 March lol. Got her not twice but four times :’D
        Xueyi or Ruan Mei? Both are very possible and very terrifying
            RM (it took me 250 pulls, I won the 50/50 4 times, and lost once to Himeko. I don’t think I’ll ever be this unlucky lucky again. I was literally considering getting Blade bc she kept coming when I wanted March.)
                Hey, at least your support is busted
                    Agreed, I used her with Himeko in one of the floors today, and I was surprised at the 40k burst damage from Himeko. I forgot that my RM was e3, so it’s probably partly due to that.
Other than Ghallager, same
I am like 30 pulls away from E2 but I'll just have to wait for rerun now cause I am out of pulls. I don't even have sig LC

My only other nihility are Welt and Pela, I could probably clear faster if welt had more damage but rn only Acheron does damage in my team
    Black Swan does good amount of AOE damage too, but my other team needs her for this MOC.
        I don't even have black swan lol
He gets the knight of beauty special treatment. ;)
Boothill is typed well but not sure how he'd do against dice.
Yeah Aventurine drew a 6, her burst somehow landed a 6 and her basic did a 3, never been so glad lmao
    I thought it's only one action then it resets? Like you have to gamble for every attack
        Nope it's cumulative per gamble, for example if SW has burst she have 2 dice, if Pela has burst 5, and 7 for Acheron but I never keep her burst so only 3 from skill.
Really enjoy her tactical playstyle and that tiny bit of healing from E6 even tho SP intensive. I also often choose her than other healers for SU run as solo sustain. Her freeze came in clutch too during Aventurine fight just now.
I'm glad if that's the case then! I was also malding because, for me at least, I know it is different for everyone depending on your roster, last moc(s) and current (?) pf became suddenly harder and seemed to heavily favor meta dps owners and/or big spenders who pull for everyone in the game and can afford to hard pity every time if they got unlucky,  I mean it's normal, but it seemed too much. (not having JL in the ice weakness everywhere period was already harsh too, now it will be Acheron time, at least I have a good King Yuan so I will be able to do something, but he's sadly not quite on the same level)
Obviously you will never face any difficulties if you have jl and acheron with eidolons, but it is an extreme case.
    The games favours people who pull e0s0 for every character and doesn't go further, tbf.
Yep, we'll stay strong dude. Everyone, including us, who is clearing 34 to 36 stars, depending on the moc, without JL and Acheron is already a chad.

ok, i got it. thx to your comment i continued to try. i made a couple more different teams, but this ones were the best choices i could go with, since the main goal was to keep damaging toughness bars of the enemies and prevent them from debuffing my team. 

still, rng was mad crazy. at one point Dino decided to focus all of his attacks from additional action on squishy Bronya and almost killed her which led to a natural restart. though such surprises did not happen often and overall survivability was fine. like 1 time for each side — only from new attempts there were 2 such cases and the second one, which happened on the second side, i did not have to restart.

dealing with elites on both sides was also fine. I concentrated 75% of the damage on more tanky ones (Fridge and Cocolia with Senior staff and none other than Aventurine) and relied on memory turbulence to help finish everyone off except Aventurine obviously. Acheron ultimate was last action on a last cycle and i couldn't afford to lose any cycles with second phase of the boss.  

probably yesterday i was not so interested in understanding the mechanics, but once i read them again and tried to thoughtfully play the game everything worked out.
Yes, barely had enough to get to pity on thr LC banner and won, thank God. I had not even a single copy of GNSW with a full year of play time and all the pulls on this banner. So it was all or nothing. Would have been nice if I ever won a character 50:50 tho, this was my 6th loss in a row. Really had some hopes and dreams that this would be my time and get an eidolon or two, but nope. 200 pulls in. Still only a single acheron. Can't wait to one day get her e2 one day!
Ty
in phase 1, is his targetting random or position based?

getting QQ kidnapped is the worst feeling, you either lose a shiton of sp of lose the gamba
    Gamba for the gamba
is it 2 to 9? in phase 2 he always pull 7 to 9 which sometimes even if your unit use blast skill it is still less than him, crazy
    For phase 2, he has a rigged die from 4 to 9, with 16%, 20% and 40% chance to hit 7, 8, 9 respectively.

The odds to beat his dice rolls are about 50% for 2 hits, 85% for 3 hits and 97% for 4 hits.
Someone who likes adventures, duh
i dunno, probably a friend of archeron and inhibitor lunae
Already tried a lot of combination like pela + sw + archeron/sw + sparkle + archeron and such

but somehow this is the only way for me(my archeron is f2p, no sig lc) 

Aventurine is pretty tanky and has untargetable turn, so i need to find a way to finish it as fast as i can hence 3 dps
    The 3 dps makes sense since you can spam Ults if you win the gambles.
Well, his signature..

I pull it because i need another dps lol
If you have argenti he absolutely mogs aventurine since you can get his ult from the gamble pretty often
honestly, the dino came across more annoying than scary... due to the fact that i only have kafka to break its weakness

but yeah, cocolia really is brutal

kafka hyeprcarry, Acheron Hypercarry
Yikes. That bad huh. I am curious to see what is the consensus for the current MoC in the upcoming days and whether the bosses are getting out of hand for most people and if they should be nerfed.
Yeah, I also forgot that you can just play double sustain to get the no downed characters and then replay the floor with good team to clear in time.
May I ask how you've built your Xueyi..? As in, the prerequisite stats, her LC, and so on?

I'm not planning on pulling for anybody until Robin and she's a support, so I have room for building another DPS. Xueyi seems genuinely interesting and her animations are amazing, but I have low eidolons on her so I was going to put her off for another time.

Then I saw your clear with her, and it intrigued me enough that I'm now planning to build her too lol.
    https://preview.redd.it/zia2l0eaunuc1.png?width=1602&format=png&auto=webp&s=98050024f0842e3ed7fdc237cf983b3183c163ed

Here's my Xueyi build that I've been cooking for a while now. Cleared the dino floor in 5 cycles without Ruan Mei with Tingyun / Sparkle / Fu Xuan. Ideally you want a Break effect rope, ATK% orb (not quantum DMG) and Crit DMG or Crit Rate body depending on your substats. Herta shop light cone is absolutely the best one for her from the current selection available to her. Quantum 4-set is better but thief set was more easy to find good substats for since I had an abundance of those pieces from farming that cavern + weekly bosses. 

  
ATK% orb is because Xueyi gets a lot of bonus DMG % from break effect so quantum DMG% would just be diminishing value on her. Try to squeeze in as much ATK%, Break effect and Crit substats as possible. I have ATK% boots because I use Sparkle with her so Xueyi can stay low speed very comfortably. Speed boots are a fine option if you have no turn-manipulation supports to use with her. She has fairly low ATK so she benefits from Tingyun's ATK boost quite a bit. I use Inert Salsotto since she's E6 and therefore does follow-up attacks far more often. Before E6 I think Space sealing station, Glamoth or possibly even Rutilant arena is better to use if you have no good Salsotto pieces.
        Thank you very much! I've saved your comment and I'll be referencing it in the future for my build on Xueyi.
    Xueyi needs a lot of stats so it's not easy. avoid Dmg% orb, go for ATK%, Break effect around 150-170, the usual crit values, and speed. You'd have to look at your supports available, if you're running her with Ruan mei, you can go a little less on BE & Spd, but there's a little anti synergy with ruan mei's extra break delay. with sparkle, you can drop speed. and focus on atk% instead.
Didn't know that was possible. My Sparkle is only at 145 something speed, and I'm still sweating trying to provide Skill Points Points for DHIL and Yukong using their skill every turn.
Some good ol' stalling. Genshin players faced this with the Wenut now HSR can experience it.
    That mofo is not in abyss very often right?
        Yeah not a regular luckily. I always suffer when it does though. I have 2 minutes for it generally and I still cut it close to the 7 min mark. It's invulnerable for like 50% of the time iirc?
Bronya nudes if she low cycles
    Does silver wolf/bronnie's have the same effect?
4 pc Quantum set + 2 pc Glamoth set. 3250 ATK, 81/180 CR/CDMG.

I say Sparkle and Tingyun are more important here. You don’t need to aim for that high amount of crit damage. Just go for crit rate while Sparkle does the rest
    Oh our stats aren't too different ngl
Not really no, I used E0S0 Huohuo, E0S0 Jingliu, E0S1 Hanabi, and E1S0 RM for the 2nd half, tho it took me 7 cycles to beat Bossventurine

First half was Acheron E0S1, SW E1S1, Sweaty Pela, and Trendy Geppy in 3 cycles
    Luocha carried me so hard lol. I got unlucky with the dices but his cleanse was key and helped me clear in almost 4 cycles (just touched 5). And I messed up first half with Acheron cause Gallagher and welt were on life support 💀
what acheron and gamba does to a mf
Extra 100hp wouldn't change anything. 
    Extra HP and defense! On Tingyun that's like, an extra hit she can take with how squish she is.

Also, for Black Swan that's more damage since it's also Attack...
    nah I survived aventurine coin blast with 112 hp on ting with luocha support.
What's the point of leveling supports past 75? Their lvl 80 traces in 9/10 cases are useless and 5 levels give barely any stats for required resources.
    Survivability, extra bit always helps.
    they'd take less dmg from the level difference mechanic, otherwise it kinda just looks nice.
    They must have infinite money for that
I aren't builded Pela before (guilty as charged), so use Welt instead. He too has DEF-. Only on Ult, tho.  
But IMG break without break is good too.
    "I aren't builded"... My eyes are bleeding... 
my experience with ting and bronya -1 is that I have to skill twice with ting in a row leaving me with skp issues for next cycle (I don't have sparkle) I could use pela for def ahred but my acheron might want her too in half 1
people who dont have limited sustain units and ruanmei D:
Yeah i was surprised my fu xuan actually struggled against him lol
Could be rough, Aventurine is a big sustain check
Same team (With Luocha) and it was pretty straight forward. I'm pretty sure Bronya and Ruan Mei have HP or Def Orbs though and maybe defensive armor too. Luocha might also have a defensive orb. 

Comfort > an extra CD sub roll.
> How did you 3-cycled Aven with JL? Is yours E1? It still took me 5 cycles with some good RNG on my side, otherwise it would definitely take one more cycle.

My Jingliu is E0S1. Ruan Mei is E1 so that might have been the reason, cuz her E1 gives 20% def ignore.
Yeah that's probably true. I guess I'll find out soon lol.
The TV doesn’t work, no. Neither does Huohuo or Tingyun’s Ult. They refills Energy, but don’t immediate max it out.

Not sure about Auspicious Star (I don’t actually have Acheron) but I believe it refills Energy so it doesn’t work with Acheron.
Wtf is skill points on your first team ha ha ha.
    Positive, negative, neutral, technically negative but you won't be using her skill often due to slow Acheron since she's just ult botting off the DoTs.
        Lightning lord Acheron for real. Even better since there's no JingYuan holding her back (by being cc'ed)
    Skill points are enough since the fight is over after 1-2 cycles. My Gepard is speedy(142) for SP generation. Kafka(160+) BS(142)

Aventurine took 8+ turns lmao
    The mommy team (Kafka Swan Acheron Mei) has always been about overcharging Acheron so hard that her own skill becomes optional. He's running a trend tank over RM even.

Your actual turns matter little on this squad. It's just Acheron ult spam from trend procs, swan cards and kafka FUAs.
Actually, if you happen to have Xueyi, it’s a rare MoC where she feels really good to play. QQ also works somewhat good. 

My Dan is E2, and I cleared with him in 4 cycles (could’ve been 3 tbh, I got a bit too greedy with the first wave.) And I managed to do 3 cycle with Xueyi with a somewhat mid build. And mind you, I kinda have skill issue, lol.

I think second half gave me more trouble, as I lack any premium sustain. With Gepard, my Black Swan had just 80 hp left when I was done. That dice encounter is kinda too tight, lack of Fu Xuan really makes it hard.
    E2 DHIL slaps because you get an additional turn after the ultimate. My DHIL is E0 only, so he is kind of useless.

Like, the devs really optimized the last floor for only a few five-star characters (JY, DoT, follow-up), and it's sad.

I dropped this game after SW's release and just recently returned just before 2.0. So, no good time for me.
        I know, I brought up that mine is E2 just to highlight how good Xueyi is in current first half.

But yeah, without E2 it’s rough. It’s not even about his damage, it’s about amount of break he does. Thought I ran Sparkle, SW and lynx for Iamgainaty weakness on cocolia, but I think that Dino is the real problem, it has more toughness than a boss(?) for some reason?? And it’s again not about damage you do, it’s about your sustain. Lynx is not enough until you consistently break, since Dino just deals absurd amount of damage. Overall, this new elite is kinda overtuned. They REALLY want you to have a good breaker.
            It's also about damage. My DHIL, who is 80/160, deals 100k damage to Aventurine (+Sparkle). Since it's less than 10%, it will take at least 10 more turns to kill him (over two phases). That is already enough not to get three stars.

My Acheron, though, takes two to four turns to defeat Aventurine.
                Because he has imaginary res… That’s why I suggested him only for the first half.
    Yeah QQ is fine, she cleaned up side 1 in 3 cycles and my e0s1 acheron cleaned up side 2 in 4 cycles.
    I’ve been swapping my E2DHIL around trying to figure out where he should go, what was your strategy for each half?
        First half I went with E2 Herta lc DHIL, E1 sparkle with DDD, tutorial SW and lynx. Weakness implant on whatever doesn’t have img weakness and just break it. Focus on dino more, since getting rid of it ASAP is the key. Actually, SW could’ve been replaced with RM or Tingyun for even faster Dino break, but I haven’t done multiple attempts, Cocolia might’ve felt like a joke explicitly due to addition of img weakness (she was banished into shadow realm practically with being mostly broken)

  
Second half I just brute forced with E0S1 Kafka, E1 EotP BS, E1 S3 MotP RM and Geppie.  Like, absolutely breaindead strat (I wonder why my BS had 80 Hp at the end)
            thanks! i don’t have rm, gepard, or sw, but i do have luocha and bailu lol hopefully i can make something work!
                Luocha for the first side and bailu for the second and you shouldn't struggle that much. If anything, it should be a bit easier from survivability point 
Slow... at first, I pair him with SW to break the Dino, but it takes too long, and I don't have sparkle. Mine is atk boots e0s1 DHIL
people are only doing that because relic farming has awful rng, while traces are guaranteed progress. its better to spend 1000 energy with raised traces than 1000 energy with zero useful relics
good bot

        RM (it took me 250 pulls, I won the 50/50 4 times, and lost once to Himeko. I don’t think I’ll ever be this unlucky lucky again. I was literally considering getting Blade bc she kept coming when I wanted March.)
            Hey, at least your support is busted

Black Swan does good amount of AOE damage too, but my other team needs her for this MOC.
    I don't even have black swan lol

                    I... I have E2 Welt iirc... :(
Xueyi or Ruan Mei? Both are very possible and very terrifying
    RM (it took me 250 pulls, I won the 50/50 4 times, and lost once to Himeko. I don’t think I’ll ever be this unlucky lucky again. I was literally considering getting Blade bc she kept coming when I wanted March.)
        Hey, at least your support is busted
            Agreed, I used her with Himeko in one of the floors today, and I was surprised at the 40k burst damage from Himeko. I forgot that my RM was e3, so it’s probably partly due to that.
I don't even have black swan lol
Nope it's cumulative per gamble, for example if SW has burst she have 2 dice, if Pela has burst 5, and 7 for Acheron but I never keep her burst so only 3 from skill.
Thank you very much! I've saved your comment and I'll be referencing it in the future for my build on Xueyi.
Yeah not a regular luckily. I always suffer when it does though. I have 2 minutes for it generally and I still cut it close to the 7 min mark. It's invulnerable for like 50% of the time iirc?
Lightning lord Acheron for real. Even better since there's no JingYuan holding her back (by being cc'ed)
I know, I brought up that mine is E2 just to highlight how good Xueyi is in current first half.

But yeah, without E2 it’s rough. It’s not even about his damage, it’s about amount of break he does. Thought I ran Sparkle, SW and lynx for Iamgainaty weakness on cocolia, but I think that Dino is the real problem, it has more toughness than a boss(?) for some reason?? And it’s again not about damage you do, it’s about your sustain. Lynx is not enough until you consistently break, since Dino just deals absurd amount of damage. Overall, this new elite is kinda overtuned. They REALLY want you to have a good breaker.
    It's also about damage. My DHIL, who is 80/160, deals 100k damage to Aventurine (+Sparkle). Since it's less than 10%, it will take at least 10 more turns to kill him (over two phases). That is already enough not to get three stars.

My Acheron, though, takes two to four turns to defeat Aventurine.
        Because he has imaginary res… That’s why I suggested him only for the first half.
First half I went with E2 Herta lc DHIL, E1 sparkle with DDD, tutorial SW and lynx. Weakness implant on whatever doesn’t have img weakness and just break it. Focus on dino more, since getting rid of it ASAP is the key. Actually, SW could’ve been replaced with RM or Tingyun for even faster Dino break, but I haven’t done multiple attempts, Cocolia might’ve felt like a joke explicitly due to addition of img weakness (she was banished into shadow realm practically with being mostly broken)

  
Second half I just brute forced with E0S1 Kafka, E1 EotP BS, E1 S3 MotP RM and Geppie.  Like, absolutely breaindead strat (I wonder why my BS had 80 Hp at the end)
    thanks! i don’t have rm, gepard, or sw, but i do have luocha and bailu lol hopefully i can make something work!
        Luocha for the first side and bailu for the second and you shouldn't struggle that much. If anything, it should be a bit easier from survivability point 
...oh

RIP!

Here's hoping you get her on Standard Banner!!
    Hopefully, I’m afraid ghallager’s E2 was too valuable
