[[No way! They have lessened RNG grind!]]





Oh, right after I spend half-day farming for 5 Jadeite.

... but honestly, I do still need a lot more, since I haven't got the Zhu costume. Thanks a lot Cygames.
    I mean you still needed 3 drops, so that's not bad at all. They only let you buy 25 in total and you need 28.
        That's still a lot better than farming for random jadeite drops 28 times. 

Also if you are lazy, you can wait for next RotB for shop refresh (unless this is one-time deals?).
            The update notes confirm this is a one-time thing intended to smooth out the grind for the character. It won't refresh to 20 each run.
            The 20 is one-time only but it’s not like it would matter? If you waited for next time, you’d be able to buy the 5 that are there normally for each run and hit 28 that way.
        >They only let you buy 25 in total and you need 28.

You need 28 for Chichiri, but if you want the RotB skins, you need 30 more/element, so in total you need 58.
            its actually 45 more per element cause of the cyphers being 5 each.
                Ture, i forgot about that.

Then it is 73/element, if all cardinals will cost the same amount of materials.
    Idk if you knew but drop rate buffs affect jadeite drops so you can just go into pubs and punch the boss once and go into the next one
        I know, that's what I was doing yesterday, but even with stacked bonus drop rate it's still not 100% guaranteed drop and you also have its 1/4 rng of Jadeite.
I hope they do this for the other cardinals
    The maintenance update post implies as much; they’ve been added “to go with the Cardinal Saint addition” and it says the stock won’t reset. So seemingly they’ll be adding a separate 20 jadeites to the shop for each Cardinal that’ll be available until you buy them all.
I thought this was a mean joke but oh my god they actually added more jadeite
To put this into perspective, I had to farm 22 of these for Chichiri and I'm at 674 Shenxian badges. Being able to just buy them in the shop is a pretty nice timesave.
    I was about the same, ended at 941 badges and enough silver feathers to fill the yupei without ever touching gold.

And enough gold feathers to also uncap the yupei.
    I was at 835 badges by the time I finally had 28 Zhu Jadeites. I also had around 30 of every other Jadeite and could fully upgrade the yupei before reaching that goal.

RNG gonna RNG.
THANK. BAHAMUT.
Ty. I was losing my mind. Was weird that a unit designed to be used by new players required such an rng item. And the raid exploded too.
Holy fuck an actual fast change 
Kneejerk reaction to the complaints for sure.

If they thought the drop rate was too low for the 20-28 Chichiri wants before RotB started, the Jadeite stock would've started this high.
    Well it's really hard to make new players friendly character when it requires whole day of grinding against end game bursts on a raid that dies in 2-3 eresh attacks.
        All the players with Eresh finished their grind in under 3 hours on day 1 and stopped playing Shenx at all already.

The same as any other run of RotB. Shenx kill speeds drop off a cliff once all the endgame players are done with it, and feathers only barely stretched out the grind compared to a dry run.
            Shenx is still exploding. If I don't see one go up at full health, basically a lost cause since it's dead before I get in.
                I'm seeing it live for an average of about 90 seconds in raid finder; considering it only takes about 10 seconds to join and hit auto on the loading screen, that's plenty of time per host.
                    >considering it only takes about 10 seconds to join and hit auto on the loading screen, 

Not everyone has the same ping.......
                        Yeah, I live in Europe and still have a ping over 250 on a good day.

It still only takes me 10 seconds to join Shenxian raids and I can get lockout on them.

Learn how to menu better. Make a bookmark for the backup requests page, click the "priority tab" button on the event raids tab, don't spend 5 years staring at loot pages you don't need to see.
            Ehh, not my experience if I'm being honest. 16 hours after launch raids were still dying very quickly.
            I dunno, I still can't get more than 1 button in when joining the raids, they just explode instantly.
                Your mistake was to press buttons in the first place. For raids this fast, just put together your best 0-click team and attack. You won't guarantee blue chest but at least you'll have a shot at it.
                    Goly gee, why didn't I think of that? /s 

My account is 2 months old, there are NO good 0 button options for me. The best I can do is either using Fire with The Sun into attack button, or light with S3 Horus into full chain - that ~might~ give me enough for the blue chest.. If I can go further than 1 click lmao. 

Otherwise, my best bet is still using Bounty skill on join and pray that it goes through before the damn thing explodes into dust. Even M3 Lumi on release wasn't this bad for me.. I dread joining any Hl/Ql trains, as I feel like I'd miss over half of the hosts, as I hear it explodes just as fast
                        If you \*can\* get into HLQL in raid finder then you don't need to worry too much about it. There's no blue chest for that raid anymore and everyone has a base 20% drop chance at one of the chests that has the summons in. The other two are host and MVP.
                        You didn't understand my comment. Blue chests aren't locked behind a certain honor threshold. Rather, your chances of getting a blue chest increase the more honors you have, capping at the threshold.

Clicking a non-damaging skill and ending the fight with 0 honors= 0 chance of blue

Attacking without clicking anything, even on a completely suboptimal setup=you gain some honors= at least a chance at blue
                Sounds like you're getting enough buttons to get loot, then.

It'll slow down soon enough.
                    Yeah, apart from not being able to get even the blue chest, let alone any pendants (of which I need MANY, as this is my first ROTB)
            I farmed my wonder only yesterday onwards and raids were dying rather slow tbh
I recall, during maintenance, imagining how exactly would I justify someone who just started playing Granblue that the progression character was locked behind leech hopping to get 20 of a material with 10% drop chance in the best case scenario, and they better hurry cause the event won't come back for like 6 months.
    It's very baffling reading that this character is meant for newer players because you can't even leech Shenxian until you're rank 120, and even with the new stock of Jadeite you still need 3 drops to uncap the weapon.

I know 120 is still pretty low as far as rank goes but it's a bit disheartening to dangle this character and the yupei so close but still functionally impossible to reach for players like me who are high rank enough to do most of the event but not high enough to even leech the one thing that gives jadeite drops.
        I forgot Shenxian had a level restriction. Probably Siero's Academy is their answer to that, since just starting it quintuples the RP you gain until Rank 151.
            Oh is *that* why my rp/exp gains have exploded recently? Makes sense since it showers you with so much stuff in general but I missed that part.
After I finished my grind, oh well. Needed the feathers anyway I guess
Thank god I was looking at 60 more Jadeite for the skin
    You need HOW many?
        Lmaoo I need a ton for the seal conversion to uncap the weapons
YAAAAAS NO NEED TO KEEP SNIPING RAID BATTLES
    We still need a lot of feathers to fully upgrade the Yupei after getting Chichiri. *Unless you actually want to wait for your damage cap boosts.*
How many of this do i need btw? 20?
    28 to get the character
I thought this was a troll post at first lol I came to the sub specifically to post in the Questions thread about whether or not I was screwed if I couldn't get enough Zhu Jadeite. Thank god they added this. I was starting to get annoyed at how hard it was to get the jadeite drops.
    Although wtf, getting these feather things is not ideal now that I think about it.
        Feathers are only NECESSARY for the unlocking/uncapping. The wonder itself will slowly level up over 3-4 months or so even if 0 feathers are fed into it.

We can also get feathers from the Agni (extreme+) so save your bossfights for fire rotation.
Much welcome addition
Let's fkin gooo
Oh god I nearly cried when I saw it. Thought I wasn’t gonna get her this time around.
Yeah. It saved me time for the 20. But now I struggle with the 5 Hualong Animas
If only they made the droprate more reasonable lmao  
It's a nice change though but having a focussed raid or something where certain element drops are more likely to drop or overall higher droprates would be nice if you consider how rare the event is nowadays.
as someone who hasn't reached HL, is there no way for me to get the last 3 jadeite i need to unlock the character?
I'm honestly shocked they decided to be so generous! Highly appreciated, Cygames.
Oh my god, I gave up after my 80th jadeites with only 4 of it being Zhu Jadeite LMAO
yay i can upgrade axe without being rank 120!
Such a nice move !
I wanna thank the people who kept their foot on cygames neck for this you guys are the true mvp
THANK GOD. Complaining helps, for once.

I'm gonna buy it all. What a pain the ass to farm LOL.
I was getting extra mad seeing how I was going to get gatekeeped by the game itself till next time (For my job I don't have so much time except for Monday and Thudsay)... This made me happy again :D.
lol i already farmed the 22 i needed day one

announce this shit ahead of time cygames
    How could they if it's not planned ahead of time?
        I love how many people think I'm serious. XD
[deleted]
    I'm thankful that none of the outfits appealed to me enough to want to grind for them.
I appreciate this, but now I'm going for the Baihu skin and soulcores and jadeites are nowhere to be found since maintenance ended.
i didnt get any of this when i started grinding so thank god. seriously, i did 25 of them in a row and zip nothing.
[deleted]
    Who cares
koomer loves us
Neat! Too bad I'm hard blocked by the extremely oversubscribed and expensive Omega Anima.
Honestly less helpful than you'd think.  I did the grind from scratch and still don't actually have enough feathers to finish upgrading her yet.
    I was done with the feather grind a couple hrs before the jadeite farm.
    It really depends on your RNG. I only got 6 by the time I'm done farming feathers for both her and her yupei (64 Godfeaters, and 3 Truefeathers). 

I would have had to farm 6 more Jadeites if not for the 20 they added earlier today as I started with 8 after fully trading the 5 they restocked this ROTB.
    It's the opposite for me, I finished the feather grind first and I still need 23 of it since other elements of Jadeite kept dropping instead of Fire....
    The extra Jadeites can be traded for talismans.
I have over 200 of this. What's so hard in farming/buying it every ROTB?
    god forbid new players from anniversary try to get Chichiri

Otherwise, my best bet is still using Bounty skill on join and pray that it goes through before the damn thing explodes into dust. Even M3 Lumi on release wasn't this bad for me.. I dread joining any Hl/Ql trains, as I feel like I'd miss over half of the hosts, as I hear it explodes just as fast
        If you \*can\* get into HLQL in raid finder then you don't need to worry too much about it. There's no blue chest for that raid anymore and everyone has a base 20% drop chance at one of the chests that has the summons in. The other two are host and MVP.
        You didn't understand my comment. Blue chests aren't locked behind a certain honor threshold. Rather, your chances of getting a blue chest increase the more honors you have, capping at the threshold.

Clicking a non-damaging skill and ending the fight with 0 honors= 0 chance of blue

Attacking without clicking anything, even on a completely suboptimal setup=you gain some honors= at least a chance at blue
Sounds like you're getting enough buttons to get loot, then.

It'll slow down soon enough.
    Yeah, apart from not being able to get even the blue chest, let alone any pendants (of which I need MANY, as this is my first ROTB)
>considering it only takes about 10 seconds to join and hit auto on the loading screen, 

Not everyone has the same ping.......
    Yeah, I live in Europe and still have a ping over 250 on a good day.

It still only takes me 10 seconds to join Shenxian raids and I can get lockout on them.

Learn how to menu better. Make a bookmark for the backup requests page, click the "priority tab" button on the event raids tab, don't spend 5 years staring at loot pages you don't need to see.
