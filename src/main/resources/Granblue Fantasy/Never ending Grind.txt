[[Never ending Grind]]





Kancolle is the true sanity breaker, GBF is more of a time sink than the frustration hell kancolle events are.
    pretty much, gbf's there to waste your time the most difficult part of the game is staying on track of long term grinds
    What happens in Kancolle?
        rng happens that is all you can have the perfect comp with the perfect gear on each ship and still go the complete wrong way or get insta-gibbed by a random DD
            or have a perfectly healthy fleet at night battle and the boss is one cut-in away from kill, but none of your ships target the boss
                Or you could have the perfect comp, perfect set up, get to night battles on the last boss after 10 minutes of other battles, get a perfect cut in attack on your last ship and not kill the fucking boss with the cut in crit leaving the boss at 2HP. AHHHHHHHH
                    Sparkle all your ships, first node one ship goes into the red
                        Gotta sparkle them, gotta ring them to boost stats, gotta use the event gear that hopefully you kept from 3 months ago and didn't take break from, and a single bad RNG means you gotta go repair them, spend buckets, sparkle again GOD DAMN IM GLAD I QUIT THAT GAME
                        Jesus christ I forgot about sparkling 1-1, what a cancerous 7 year old mechanic
        It also has perma-death IIRC, so if your wife ship sinks she's gone for ever.
            Hardcore mode in a gacha game... that's a new kind of sadism.
                Worse! They sell cash shop items to keep the ship from dying permanently.

In fairness, there's also a "if the ship is not severely damaged, it can't be lost" mechanic - so it's not like the game just goes "lol, stars aligned, your waifu is gone for good". But it means that effectively, if the enemies all decide to whomp on one of your ships and it takes severe damage, you're heading back to base; nothing you can win is remotely worth losing a high-leveled ship.

But a big part of it is that the navigation -within- areas is random. So you need to randomly go the right way (so as not to get into so many fights that attrition makes victory impossible), you need to win those fights with your ships randomly targeting the enemy and the enemy randomly targeting you, then hope you've got enough health left to finish off the boss and that your big hitters decide to -attack- the boss and not hammer a weak enemy ship with everything they've got...

And THEN you get to see if the thing you wanted randomly drops.

Oh, and you have to repair in between fights, by putting ships into the "dock" (i.e. a long bath) for real time - hours of real time if they're damaged enough, unless you use "instant repair" items.

Kancolle events are like GFL ones - you've got a relatively long time, real-time-wise, but even then it's not "how long did it take you to finish?" but "did you manage to finish?"
                    It also means a single moment of lack of attention, or being distracted/sleepy and not noticing or remembering your ship was in the red AND PUSHING FORWARD with the mission meant losing a unit permanently. That's absolute bullshit.
                Kancolle's not a gacha game.  You farm ships either through missions or crafting.  

As for the permadeath, the only way for that to happen is if you're greedy.  It's ALWAYS possible to prevent permadeath.  Basically the mechanic is they have to "die" two fights in a row without you repairing them in between.  You can retreat from the mission if you lose a ship in the first fight.  

It's still not a good game for a variety of reasons.  Most of them RNG related.
                    Doesn't matter if the perma-death is preventable or hard to fullfil the conditions for it to happen, the very fact that there even is a perma-death mechanic is bad in its own.
                    Wait, don't Kancolle players need to farm materials, *then* use said materials to build a ship *and then* hope they get the ship they want? I know there are certain recipes which get a higher chance for certain ships but that isn't still gacha? Also, can't they paid get those materials needed without farming? Sounds a lot like a gacha game if you ask me
        RNG game lol

All you can do is maximise everything and hope for the best.   
Literally can have everything perfect and fail 100s of times in a row due to bad luck, though obviously unlikely.
        Kancolle events are like masturbating while tossing coin for 10 times head streaks, for each time u lose the streak, u must wait ur thing completely soft, even u nearly come out. 
And u need to come out exactly while u got the 10times streak.
    can attest this is true.
    If people think GBF is "sanity-breaking", they will never survive Kancolle's RNG fiesta.
    Others are games, kancolle is a washing machine simulator.

You put in all ur shit, then press start. The rest got nothing to do with you.

Except nothing get cleaned.
    After 2 years of Kancolle, moved to GBF and never looked back. I was tired of following an Ikea guideline for events and still taking days to get past the same boss until RNG decided to let me pass.
    GBF does break our timeslots. I mean, how many people have probably cut work just to do Unite and Fight?
    Fuck my ptsd when my first Kaga sink is coming back to me
    kancolle finally got too bullshitty though, the second i saw they went into Z# nodes i'm like, "what in tanaka's ass are they doing, stuffing literally 4 maps in one stage
        when they started putting 2-3 phases into several stages effectively making 6-7 maps actually 10-11 that's when i knew shit had really hit the fan

enough of transport stages please
    I remember ragequitting Summer... 2 or 3 event, when after several hours and at least 100 buckets of grinding I kept failing due to RNG. Fairly sure I quit the game soon after, it just wasn't fun anymore.
    Oh the compass lord please
Imagine if only there is game like Genshin Impact but for Granblue.

Oh yeah, Relink exist.....

But who knows when ~~it wil be released~~ the next trailer drop...
    This is easy: Christmas Livestream. It's never not been there, and Cygames doesn't release info about Relink outside of their own events.
        They also announced on the summer livestream that they would have more info on the December stream.
            They'll reveal in the December stream that they'll release the date for the announcement of the trailer at a later date.
                So the Persona/Atlus model
                Later date being the 2022 Summer livestream, where they will announce that Relink will have a PS5 port.
        Yeah thats the problem. I think at this point, people can only just waiting for the trailer, instead of the game. Lol....
    > Oh yeah, Relink exist

does it tho
    We can only hope that Genshin release pushes the Relink team into high gear. It's been 2? 3 years since the platinum trailer was revealed, they're taking way too much time for this.
        Ironing out kinks and PS5 are likely a factor. Plus they had a whole other game we didn't know about until months before it released.
            That was being made by a completely different company though.
                Fkhr and kmr were still heavily involved in both as fkhr was the main designer in how they fight.

They also moved the rest of the game in house for re:link which is extra work on top of running their multiple games.
    If only a retail Granblue game exists that won't fuck over PC players...
Needs a rhythm game like Bandori or Love Live in here.

"I broke your fingers"
    As someone who used to tier in Bandori, Love Live and Shining Live, my wrists were feeling it for days, if not weeks. There was a reason I retired after a year or so and went casual.
    SIF was literally painful to play on my teensy phone.
    Man, I really loved the Love Live game, but a stamina mechanic for a rhythm game really sucks.  I stopped because I could do like two songs on the harder difficulties before I couldn't play anymore.
        Yeah and the rhythm aspect of the newer game (LL All Stars) is just....not fun. It became more of an idol collection game, which is fine but Starlight Light can balance between those two just fine.
    Me playing full length songs in Bandori. My fingers are crying everytime lol.
    also your eyesight
    Racing a lot of raids back to back hurts my wrist in this game too.
    *Meanwhile, for Call of Duty Mobile...*

**Let me introduce ourselves!**
I think Arknights broke my sanity on a daily basis.

I shameless admit that Granblue Fantasy broke my dick.
    There is no shame in that, brother.
They all broke my dick
    There it is
I have genshin impact on my ps4 so i can grind for ticket in gbf while playing genshin on console.
    Do you have a pro? I started on PS4 but it runs like hot shit on the base model so I gave up. Feels bad when my phone can run a game way better.
        IIRC PS4 version isn't terribly well optimized, and it's not exactly a new piece of hardware. Phone version is also not as good as PC but still lower graphics/requirements.
        Pro is not much better. A lot of stutter and slowdown. Its just not optimized for the console...
    Nice. I'm waiting for the switch version cause no way my phone will handle it
What's this about Genshin spying on you?
    The anticheat stayed up after you closed the game and didn't install right with the game, they already fixed both. Also saw a thing about Japanese players saying it read your clipboard, at least on iOS, but the same article stated that it's likely a bug since other programs have had the same issue. Honestly I don't think it's anything.
        It’s indeed a bug for iOS part, people were pointing it out way before Genshin released. Idk about PC tho, Valorant had the same problem when it released.
    The app reads from your clipboard when you launch the game.  There are a few other games doing the same thing, one of the devs (forget which one) claimed that was just the OS sdk they were doing that automatically did it or something.
    Probably because of genshin impact made by Chinese developer.
        [deleted]
            They removed it when it was reported tho.
                should never have been there in the first place.
                They did not remove it. They claimed it will stop running when the program is turned off. For something on the kernel level that is a minor obstacle.
                Imagine if it was never reported.
                    Nothing, look at Valorant, been doing it since beta.
Granblue, azur lane, fgo, not one penny spent just farm the events
    FGO in particular is more f2p than most as long as you're willing to forsake your waifu and cuddle up to best dog.
        No.

FGO is definitely not the most F2P out there.

I'd reckon Granblue (and Princess Connect, basically Cygame) that is the most F2P.

They give away so much that you basically never need to buy any crystal, if you want to spent some you'd buy a guaranteed ticket instead, same price plus you can select any character in that box.
            to be fair FGO is very f2p if you know what you are doing, unlike GBF where anything not SSR is instantly benched forever. low rarity stuff in FGO is still extremely powerful, they are just more specialized in what they do very well. One of the top end wave clear farmers in the game is a 1 star for perspective.

GBF is definitely more free to play, after how much stuff cygames just gave out I don't think that's up for debate, but saying FGO isn't very F2P is wrong, you can clear everything in the game without spending a dime. The gacha rates are terrible absolutely, but you honestly don't have to spend a dime and you can kill the final story boss no problems.
                You are correct - I don't remember an SR unit I'd use in GBF over SSRs, maybe except Mirin (Wind) and for some time, Sen until I got better team comp to use MC as DPS unit.

Meanwhile in FGO you can clear even challenge quests with free units, even if it means sometimes borrowing a secondary DPS or support from friends as backup.
                    FGO has a couple of reasons that other rarities are good.  The biggest one is that there is a point limit on what you can put in your team.  The fact of the matter is you can't just put all SSR Servants and Craft Essences in your team. They simply won't fit.  SRs are also still pretty rare.  They're the same rate as GBF SSRs when it's not a gala.

With that said, I feel like you're ignoring that GBF also gives you a bunch of decent SSRs.  It's at least as welfare-y as FGO is, and unlike FGO, any new player has access to a lot of them.  In FGO, if you missed the event, well too bad.
                        I mean... yeah, I like that GBF has many units you can get from event reruns or the sidestories, but I wouldn't call most of the free SSRs good. FGO has some decent welfares - Chloe, Kintoki, Shiki etc, but also some mediocre ones. GBF had... few. Very few.

Eternals/Arcanum are technically F2P so I guess they count and most of them are very good, but to fully upgrade them takes VERY long time to grind out.
                            Arcarum (No 'N' in it :) ) is hard time gated yeah (though honestly so are the good FGO welfares if you missed the first run), but Eternals aren't really THAT hard to get.  Sure it takes some work, but having a few at 5* in under a year is definitely feasible.  I just got 5* Eahta and I've only been playing since the anniversary event.  And I stopped for a few months in the middle there.  I twenty boxed the last GW for Tien, and I'm going to finish it out in this next one.  If you want a real F2P grind, take a look at DBZ Dokkan Battle.  That shit is terrible.

There's also the fact that Granblue gives out a TON more free draws than FGO.  Throw in the sparking system, and you're basically guaranteed a couple of top tier units.  Then there's the fact that most of your strength in this game comes from your grid, which is almost entirely F2P.  Even if you have pretty crappy characters, you can continue to progress because a lot of your power comes from farming weapons.
                                Yeah, 5* isn't as hard as it used to be, but I was mostly referring to the "final" upgrade that was released recently.

Granblue does give a lot more draws, but imagine if you didn't *need* those draws and could use your favorite SRs and succeed as you do with SSRs.

Nevermind that Granblue *does* have multiplayer element, meaning you not having SSRs does mean you will not contribute during Guild Wars as much as other people and during multiplayer fights you have smaller chances to get high enough score to get bonus chest...

>Then there's the fact that most of your strength in this game comes from your grid, which is almost entirely F2P.

Debatable. You CAN do F2P, but other than very grind-intense double Magna grids you still need an elemental summon, right? I think that hasn't changed since I stopped playing - few grids can handle double Magna as it is.
                                    >You CAN do F2P, but other than very grind-intense double Magna grids you still need an elemental summon, right? 

I think the part you're forgetting is the second summon is a support summon.  You absolutely don't need to own it yourself.  I certainly don't own a Lucifer, and my Bahamut is nowhere close to ULB.  It's like borrowing your buddy's Merlin/Skadi in FGO.  And it's preferable to have them as a support summon as well, because support summons can always be called turn 1, no matter what their cooldown is.

Also they just boosted the drop rate for M2.  They've also just started running drop rate events.  I've literally went from almost no M2 weapons to all full M2 grids in the past few weeks.
                "Being able to clear the game" doesn't make a game f2p-friendly, just f2p-capable. You're still a second-class citizen.
                    You're a second class citizen in every gacha game you don't pay in tbh, that's just the nature of how they work.
                        But some moreso than others. I've never felt like that in Azur Lane, for example- whatever its other failings, even as a F2P player you get way more characters to play around with than you can ever use, and the only thing to spend money on is dresses to make your girls look even prettier.  FGO might not nickel-and-dime you like some other games (looking at you, E7), but that's because it doesn't even care about giving good value to the people who DO whale. The gacha is cruel and that's just how they like it.
                Well, if you're talking about low rarity stuff

You're right.

But in my experience, while in FGO you "can" clear hard challenge quest with low rarity, it still very tedious to say the least.

While in GBF it's very tedious to just use low rarity, you can't outright clear harder content with low rarity.

But GBF also did give away SSR character for free, including farmable one, that can be use to clear hardest content in the game, provided you have good grid.

So, all in all, both are almost the same? But GBF is giving more.

And yes, I'm totally bias toward GBF.

But I've also been playing both game for years, FGO was even longer than GBF

And I still feel like I need to roll that 4 main support to make my life easier in FGO, while painfully farming event repeatedly (and sometime free quest for very hard to drop mats)

while in GBF I just took it easy, farming stuffs as I want, collecting pendent weekly to exchange for weapons, then collecting free crystal for spark, and I've spark for about 7 times now.

So, yeah, I still think GBF is much more friendly to F2P players than FGO.
                Yeah FGO is in this weird zone where while the gacha definitely isn't F2P, the wellfare resources definitely are. 

Theyre so good that you can argue FGO's deliberatley fucks over the gacha especially considering how consistently the gacha release of FGO have been rather bad whereas wellfares always sits on "really really good" or "ridiculously overpowered". The sheer disparity between the 2 version of Yu should have been a good tell to how FGO does their thing

Its honestly sometimes hard to feel motivated to save up for servant in FGO, gameplay wise since you just knew they would get fucked over just because theyre not free(or Anni feature) >_>
                    Hey now, FGO has some really good welfares (Shiki, BB, Kuro, Mecha Liz, Ruler Quetz, Jaltzerker, Kagetora), a single broken one (Kintoki), but the vast majority of them are lost in the sea of "mediocre, but niche/workable" (Sieg, Chacha, Janta, Rider Ishtar, Assassin Scathach, Ryouma, Nobu, etc) and a couple terrible ones (Iri, Brave Liz, Saber Lily, Bunyan).
            Necessitating certain gacha units for clears unless you ludicrously outgrid them makes GBF *much* less f2p friendly. Not to mention there's actual competition in GBF with guildwars. Exacerbating this issue is the amount of time nearly everything worth doing in GBF has to be farmed ad nauseum. Even if not having the right units for something might cause you to take double the amount of time to clear something in FGO, you would still be spending an insane amount more time in GBF because it demands that much more of you.

FGO is more f2p friendly to me because:

* The average player can be reasonably be expected to clear challenge content

* The power creep is relatively low meaning you don't have to be getting new units constantly to keep up

* The amount of time to farm events is comparatively very low making chase units less mandatory

* Most importantly, there's no competition that pits f2p users against people that spend money
                > The average player can be reasonably be expected to clear challenge content

The same goes for GBF, with *commensurately* similar time invested. A newbie a week in FGO won't be able to clear challenge quests, a newbie a month old in GBF won't be able to attempt Proud quests. Give the FGO player a month and the GBF player a year (or at least half) and they'll still be at similar stages of progression. GBF is a *bigger* game, that has no impact on its F2P status.

>The power creep is relatively low meaning you don't have to be getting new units constantly to keep up

Both games have the same amount of power creep, imo. There are terrible or powercreeped year 1 units in both (Saber Altera, Alexander the Great vs Carmellina, Forte) and both games consistently go back and buff aforementioned old units (Artoria, Sanzang, Zeta, Olivia). If anything GBF does this more because you're "guaranteed" that any 4* SSRs will, eventually, get a 5* to increase their abilities.

>The amount of time to farm events is comparatively very low making chase units less mandatory

Farming in FGO is "have a Waver or suffer", to say nothing of Merlin, Skadi and Castoria (all very limited Servants, btw) so this argument is bullshit.

>Most importantly, there's no competition that pits f2p users against people that spend money

That part is true, at least.
                    > The same goes for GBF, with commensurately similar time invested.

This is really, really not true. You can 100% get a full set of useful characters to max level and their skills reasonably leveled within a month for GBF to complete challenge quests. Especially if you don't mind spending command seals. You definitely cannot be ready to fight Luci HL within even a couple months without serious no lifing.

>Both games have the same amount of power creep, imo.

100% no. I don't think anyone reasonable would agree with this. Meta units coming out completely blow away units coming out the years previous. Using Saber Altera is in no way even remotely comparable to trying to use Carmelina. 

Also, putting aside the GBF vs FGO thing, the idea that you're "guaranteed" a 5* in any character is complete bollocks. 

>Farming in FGO is "have a Waver or suffer", to say nothing of Merlin, Skadi and Castoria (all very limited Servants, btw) so this argument is bullshit.

So use a friend's. I also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary.  I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

There's a number of decent excellent f2p farming units like Arash and Spartacus. It's not "have these limited units or you have literally nothing."
                        >This is really, really not true. You can 100% get a full set of useful characters to max level and their skills reasonably leveled within a month for GBF to complete challenge quests. Especially if you don't mind spending command seals. You definitely cannot be ready to fight Luci HL within even a couple months without serious no lifing.


I said "commensurate" time invested, not "same" time invested. Google that if you don't know what the word means.

>100% no. I don't think anyone reasonable would agree with this. Meta units coming out completely blow away units coming out the years previous. Using Saber Altera is in no way even remotely comparable to trying to use Carmelina.

Both are serviceable, both are ultimately bottom tier compared to most of their peers. Carmellina being comparatively worse than, say, Grimnir than Saber Altera is to Musashi is also made up by the fact that Carmelina (or any other SSR) is far easier to acquire in GBF than it would be in FGO. In FGO, you might be stuck with that Altera as your only SSR Saber for a year if you're only mildly unlucky; in GBF you can GUARANTEE getting a Grimnir or better yet an Andira within a few months.

>Also, putting aside the GBF vs FGO thing, the idea that you're "guaranteed" a 5* in any character is complete bollocks.

We know every 4* SSR in GBF will eventually get a fifth star, the question is simply how far in the future and how good it will be when it comes.


>So use a friend's. I also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary. I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

Using a friend's Waver is far more limiting than having your own, especially since most popular farming strats include having at least two meta supports (Waver/Waver, Waver/Merlin, then later Skadi/Skadi and even later on Castoria/Castoria). For harder quests, you're faced with the choice of either using a support Caster or actually picking the DPS you need for a particular fight if you don't happen to have it. FGO having no grids and no MC abilities beyond the intentionally limited scope of the Mystic Codes means you're that much more reliant on units for any setup, and that's a fact.

> also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary. I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

Because that has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a game is F2P or not. GBF is a much grindier game, no dispute there.


>There's a number of decent excellent f2p farming units like Arash and Spartacus. It's not "have these limited units or you have literally nothing."

And they're still irrelevant if you don't have a Kscope or at least an Imaginary Element. Even if you could make efficient 3-turn setups FOR THE MAJORITY OF CONTENT without any limited SSRs, the gacha also limits you in what Craft Essences you get, and potentially even worse since specific Craft Essences are never on rateup.
                            >And they're still irrelevant if you don't have a Kscope or at least an Imaginary Element.

I'm honestly questioning whether you've played the game or not at this point. Arash and Spartacus are amazing *because* they don't require kaleidoscope. There are a TON of events that give you +50% NP gauge at the start. You can easily get them to 80% and them top them off with Waver while still giving 30% to whoever's switching in for Arash.

>Because that has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a game is F2P or not. GBF is a much grindier game, no dispute there.

It's 100% relevant.  Having poor units might cause an increase in your clear times by 100% for FGO but only 30% for GBF. That sounds really bad, but when you put actual numbers to it it's an increase of 3 hours to 6 hours for FGO but 15 to 20 hours in GBF. That makes a big difference. Time isn't infinite, and demanding more out of your players that don't cough up is inherently less f2p friendly.

>For harder quests, you're faced with the choice of either using a support Caster or actually picking the DPS you need for a particular fight if you don't happen to have it.

You don't need a specific DPS to clear FGO challenge fights. You don't even really need a specific support aside from the very challengiest of challenge fights. d

>Both are serviceable, both are ultimately bottom tier compared to most of their peers.

And yet the difference between bottom tier in FGO and GBF is leagues apart. Taking Heles into your challenge fights in GBF is just being a leech. Even Altera without interlude buffs would contribute significantly more.
                                Arash's battery is only 25%. You need either a Kscope or a 50% event CE (which are in fact, rare and becoming rarer still in the future) and another battery to bring him to 100% in order to NP wave 1 (which is the only thing he's good for). Spartacus' is 50%, but his damage is also commensurately lower- very good for his rarity, but you couldn't use him, for example, to farm the recent Gilfest's mobs. 

Having sub-optimal units plays a comparatively small part (compared to summon and grid strength) when it comes to fast clears in GBF. Not having a very few very specific limited characters in FGO makes or breaks farming teams.

Now I'm the one who has to question whether you've player FGO at this point. There have been in the past (and are yet to come in the future, at least to NA) numerous CQ's blatantly pandering to specific recently-released units.


I already made my point re: availability and capacity for upgrades of old GBF units vs old FGO ones. Have fun waiting for Salter to become relevant again in 2022.
                                    > Arash's battery is only 25%

[No, it's definitely not](https://imgur.com/a/KWbMwZ3). If you've never been around for an event with a 50% CE, then you can use Dragon Meridian, which is a 3* essence available in the FP gacha.

>Having sub-optimal units plays a comparatively small part (compared to summon and grid strength) when it comes to fast clears in GBF. Not having a very few very specific limited characters in FGO makes or breaks farming teams.

I'm not really sure how you can say this when 6 dragon raids practically live or die whether you have the right units. Have you tried doing Wadmus without any limited units? It's extraordinarily painful.

>Now I'm the one who has to question whether you've player FGO at this point. There have been in the past (and are yet to come in the future, at least to NA) numerous CQ's blatantly pandering to specific recently-released units.

That's really completely irrelevant to any points I was making. Never did I say there weren't top tier or pandered units in FGO.

>I already made my point re: availability and capacity for upgrades of old GBF units vs old FGO ones. Have fun waiting for Salter to become relevant again in 2022.

As opposed to Heles or Chat who've been unviable for around 4 years despite various rebalances?

At the end of the day, a game that makes you compete against other players who can gain an advantage over you by spending money is most definitely less f2p than what's essentially a single player game with really shitty DLC practices.

Regardless of how generous Cygames is with all their properties, players willing to spend money have a definite advantage over those that don't.
        Bullshit

I only got 1 5 star from that game and i played for a year.
        Fam, this is a joke. Azur Lane (where you can easily have a 100% collection just playing the game) is f2p friendly. GFL, same (though you use the same resources to build as you need to sortie). GBF with all its roulettes and shit is very f2p friendly. But FGO? Not even close. You CAN play it as an f2p and even have a pretty good collection if you're lucky, but you will always be a second class citizen and you will always live knowing if the gacha decides you won't get a unit, you can literally bankrupt yourself and never get that unit. FGO's gacha is among the worst scams in the industry, the game's only gotten as big as it has because of the awesome story.
            >you will always be a second class citizen

Holy living hyperbole lmao. It's a single player RPG. 

>you can literally bankrupt yourself and never get that unit

This is a personal problem. You don't ever need "that unit." Cu Chulainn himself is more than enough to get through like 95% of content if you grail him.

>FGO's gacha is among the worst scams in the industry, the game's only gotten as big as it has because of the awesome story.

Or maybe it's actually a fun game, and there's a reason one can enjoy it and GBF.

Yeah the gacha rates are awful. Among the worst in the industry, but that has nothing to do with how f2p it is when the units available for free are very powerful.
Joke on you, can't broke my phone if it's so potato I can't even meet the minimal required specs.
I don't actually spend much on FGO actually. Favorite and current stongest Servant of mine is Robin Hood who is a 3*, so...
    I only got 1 5 star from that game and I played for 3 months on and off for a year. 

Never went back to FGO and stickes to GBF and SV for my mobile games
This is fine
what's with storage on honkai? I thought genshin is larger?
    On mobile, my genshin is 6.81 while honkai 3rd is 6.67. Memoria freese is 9.62gb, and Dragalia is 7.67gb
        Dragalia let's you delete old story data now, which can clear up nearly 3 gigs
    For some reason Honkai doesn't delete old CGs for me, so the size went once to 12gb for me until I deleted that video folder.
        ooh, you can manually delete those?
            Yes, navigate to android/data/com.mihoyo.bh3global/files/assets/videos and delete everything there. When needed, for example, you want to rewatch CGs for Sakura Samsara, you can redownload it by entering SS menu.
                Thanks!
Arknights: Broke your heart
This meme should have last origin for breaking your dick
    I don't think we should let the mainstream population know this game exists, it will break a lot of things...
        wait until the global release comes out, its gonna be a right shitshow.

Unfortunately we still have no date for it beyond "it's coming after the JP release" which came out a few months ago.
            They're still going to get the censored version instead of LO at FULL POWER
                Well every version of LO has been censored on the playstore because google is shit, you have to download the uncensored APK off their website to get LO in its full glory.
        Whats Up with last origin?
            After a quick Google search from my part i can say with certainty the following: Tits, tits are what is up last origin,  you can tell just from the screenshots that the game is the result of some advanced horniness.
Why would you play genshin on mobile ? It's a blast on pc ! (or ps4 since I use controller)
    Because it has cross-save and being able to go right from PC to your phone is magic.
        Even better !
    Because I don’t have a PS4 and my laptop sounds like a jet engine when I tried to play it
        Yeah sure, It was implicit in my comment that you need a decent PC for it
Well after seeing that i deleted it instantly :( felt more a game for console than mobile tbh anyway
Objection your honor, Destiny Child is clearly the one true lord of dick breaking. My own dick has even fallen prey to that abomination of science and thot many times.
i am so glad i don't play more the three of these, fate go, grandblue, and epic seven!
Gfl. Enjoy ptsd madafaka
I don't get the last one
    If you try to play genshin impact on phone it'll heat up to the point where you phone deactivates by itself
Honkai tested your phone's limits.

Genshin whips it with barbed wire and makes it beg for more.
What does Dragalia and Feh do?
    FEH hurts your wallet. Dragalia makes you bop.
This is very accurate.
Also kinda scary how I circulate through these apps and how I have to delete honkai impact just to make room for FGO and Azur Lane and vice versa
I'm really glad that GBF was my first pick of gacha game. GBF is very generous, especially since it is playable in Chromium browsers.

Now please give me back my life, I need that to live...
Not gonna lie, mostly true for most people, but Grand Order wasn’t worth me spending any money towards, I hated it
I think this is the part where we should sing 'baka mitai'

What happens in Kancolle?
    rng happens that is all you can have the perfect comp with the perfect gear on each ship and still go the complete wrong way or get insta-gibbed by a random DD
        or have a perfectly healthy fleet at night battle and the boss is one cut-in away from kill, but none of your ships target the boss
            Or you could have the perfect comp, perfect set up, get to night battles on the last boss after 10 minutes of other battles, get a perfect cut in attack on your last ship and not kill the fucking boss with the cut in crit leaving the boss at 2HP. AHHHHHHHH
                Sparkle all your ships, first node one ship goes into the red
                    Gotta sparkle them, gotta ring them to boost stats, gotta use the event gear that hopefully you kept from 3 months ago and didn't take break from, and a single bad RNG means you gotta go repair them, spend buckets, sparkle again GOD DAMN IM GLAD I QUIT THAT GAME
                    Jesus christ I forgot about sparkling 1-1, what a cancerous 7 year old mechanic
    It also has perma-death IIRC, so if your wife ship sinks she's gone for ever.
        Hardcore mode in a gacha game... that's a new kind of sadism.
            Worse! They sell cash shop items to keep the ship from dying permanently.

In fairness, there's also a "if the ship is not severely damaged, it can't be lost" mechanic - so it's not like the game just goes "lol, stars aligned, your waifu is gone for good". But it means that effectively, if the enemies all decide to whomp on one of your ships and it takes severe damage, you're heading back to base; nothing you can win is remotely worth losing a high-leveled ship.

But a big part of it is that the navigation -within- areas is random. So you need to randomly go the right way (so as not to get into so many fights that attrition makes victory impossible), you need to win those fights with your ships randomly targeting the enemy and the enemy randomly targeting you, then hope you've got enough health left to finish off the boss and that your big hitters decide to -attack- the boss and not hammer a weak enemy ship with everything they've got...

And THEN you get to see if the thing you wanted randomly drops.

Oh, and you have to repair in between fights, by putting ships into the "dock" (i.e. a long bath) for real time - hours of real time if they're damaged enough, unless you use "instant repair" items.

Kancolle events are like GFL ones - you've got a relatively long time, real-time-wise, but even then it's not "how long did it take you to finish?" but "did you manage to finish?"
                It also means a single moment of lack of attention, or being distracted/sleepy and not noticing or remembering your ship was in the red AND PUSHING FORWARD with the mission meant losing a unit permanently. That's absolute bullshit.
            Kancolle's not a gacha game.  You farm ships either through missions or crafting.  

As for the permadeath, the only way for that to happen is if you're greedy.  It's ALWAYS possible to prevent permadeath.  Basically the mechanic is they have to "die" two fights in a row without you repairing them in between.  You can retreat from the mission if you lose a ship in the first fight.  

It's still not a good game for a variety of reasons.  Most of them RNG related.
                Doesn't matter if the perma-death is preventable or hard to fullfil the conditions for it to happen, the very fact that there even is a perma-death mechanic is bad in its own.
                Wait, don't Kancolle players need to farm materials, *then* use said materials to build a ship *and then* hope they get the ship they want? I know there are certain recipes which get a higher chance for certain ships but that isn't still gacha? Also, can't they paid get those materials needed without farming? Sounds a lot like a gacha game if you ask me
    RNG game lol

All you can do is maximise everything and hope for the best.   
Literally can have everything perfect and fail 100s of times in a row due to bad luck, though obviously unlikely.
    Kancolle events are like masturbating while tossing coin for 10 times head streaks, for each time u lose the streak, u must wait ur thing completely soft, even u nearly come out. 
And u need to come out exactly while u got the 10times streak.
can attest this is true.
If people think GBF is "sanity-breaking", they will never survive Kancolle's RNG fiesta.
Others are games, kancolle is a washing machine simulator.

You put in all ur shit, then press start. The rest got nothing to do with you.

Except nothing get cleaned.
After 2 years of Kancolle, moved to GBF and never looked back. I was tired of following an Ikea guideline for events and still taking days to get past the same boss until RNG decided to let me pass.
GBF does break our timeslots. I mean, how many people have probably cut work just to do Unite and Fight?
Fuck my ptsd when my first Kaga sink is coming back to me
kancolle finally got too bullshitty though, the second i saw they went into Z# nodes i'm like, "what in tanaka's ass are they doing, stuffing literally 4 maps in one stage
    when they started putting 2-3 phases into several stages effectively making 6-7 maps actually 10-11 that's when i knew shit had really hit the fan

enough of transport stages please
I remember ragequitting Summer... 2 or 3 event, when after several hours and at least 100 buckets of grinding I kept failing due to RNG. Fairly sure I quit the game soon after, it just wasn't fun anymore.
Oh the compass lord please
This is easy: Christmas Livestream. It's never not been there, and Cygames doesn't release info about Relink outside of their own events.
    They also announced on the summer livestream that they would have more info on the December stream.
        They'll reveal in the December stream that they'll release the date for the announcement of the trailer at a later date.
            So the Persona/Atlus model
            Later date being the 2022 Summer livestream, where they will announce that Relink will have a PS5 port.
    Yeah thats the problem. I think at this point, people can only just waiting for the trailer, instead of the game. Lol....
> Oh yeah, Relink exist

does it tho
We can only hope that Genshin release pushes the Relink team into high gear. It's been 2? 3 years since the platinum trailer was revealed, they're taking way too much time for this.
    Ironing out kinks and PS5 are likely a factor. Plus they had a whole other game we didn't know about until months before it released.
        That was being made by a completely different company though.
            Fkhr and kmr were still heavily involved in both as fkhr was the main designer in how they fight.

They also moved the rest of the game in house for re:link which is extra work on top of running their multiple games.
If only a retail Granblue game exists that won't fuck over PC players...
As someone who used to tier in Bandori, Love Live and Shining Live, my wrists were feeling it for days, if not weeks. There was a reason I retired after a year or so and went casual.
SIF was literally painful to play on my teensy phone.
Man, I really loved the Love Live game, but a stamina mechanic for a rhythm game really sucks.  I stopped because I could do like two songs on the harder difficulties before I couldn't play anymore.
    Yeah and the rhythm aspect of the newer game (LL All Stars) is just....not fun. It became more of an idol collection game, which is fine but Starlight Light can balance between those two just fine.
Me playing full length songs in Bandori. My fingers are crying everytime lol.
also your eyesight
Racing a lot of raids back to back hurts my wrist in this game too.
*Meanwhile, for Call of Duty Mobile...*

**Let me introduce ourselves!**
There is no shame in that, brother.
There it is
Do you have a pro? I started on PS4 but it runs like hot shit on the base model so I gave up. Feels bad when my phone can run a game way better.
    IIRC PS4 version isn't terribly well optimized, and it's not exactly a new piece of hardware. Phone version is also not as good as PC but still lower graphics/requirements.
    Pro is not much better. A lot of stutter and slowdown. Its just not optimized for the console...
Nice. I'm waiting for the switch version cause no way my phone will handle it
The anticheat stayed up after you closed the game and didn't install right with the game, they already fixed both. Also saw a thing about Japanese players saying it read your clipboard, at least on iOS, but the same article stated that it's likely a bug since other programs have had the same issue. Honestly I don't think it's anything.
    It’s indeed a bug for iOS part, people were pointing it out way before Genshin released. Idk about PC tho, Valorant had the same problem when it released.
The app reads from your clipboard when you launch the game.  There are a few other games doing the same thing, one of the devs (forget which one) claimed that was just the OS sdk they were doing that automatically did it or something.
Probably because of genshin impact made by Chinese developer.
    [deleted]
        They removed it when it was reported tho.
            should never have been there in the first place.
            They did not remove it. They claimed it will stop running when the program is turned off. For something on the kernel level that is a minor obstacle.
            Imagine if it was never reported.
                Nothing, look at Valorant, been doing it since beta.
FGO in particular is more f2p than most as long as you're willing to forsake your waifu and cuddle up to best dog.
    No.

FGO is definitely not the most F2P out there.

I'd reckon Granblue (and Princess Connect, basically Cygame) that is the most F2P.

They give away so much that you basically never need to buy any crystal, if you want to spent some you'd buy a guaranteed ticket instead, same price plus you can select any character in that box.
        to be fair FGO is very f2p if you know what you are doing, unlike GBF where anything not SSR is instantly benched forever. low rarity stuff in FGO is still extremely powerful, they are just more specialized in what they do very well. One of the top end wave clear farmers in the game is a 1 star for perspective.

GBF is definitely more free to play, after how much stuff cygames just gave out I don't think that's up for debate, but saying FGO isn't very F2P is wrong, you can clear everything in the game without spending a dime. The gacha rates are terrible absolutely, but you honestly don't have to spend a dime and you can kill the final story boss no problems.
            You are correct - I don't remember an SR unit I'd use in GBF over SSRs, maybe except Mirin (Wind) and for some time, Sen until I got better team comp to use MC as DPS unit.

Meanwhile in FGO you can clear even challenge quests with free units, even if it means sometimes borrowing a secondary DPS or support from friends as backup.
                FGO has a couple of reasons that other rarities are good.  The biggest one is that there is a point limit on what you can put in your team.  The fact of the matter is you can't just put all SSR Servants and Craft Essences in your team. They simply won't fit.  SRs are also still pretty rare.  They're the same rate as GBF SSRs when it's not a gala.

With that said, I feel like you're ignoring that GBF also gives you a bunch of decent SSRs.  It's at least as welfare-y as FGO is, and unlike FGO, any new player has access to a lot of them.  In FGO, if you missed the event, well too bad.
                    I mean... yeah, I like that GBF has many units you can get from event reruns or the sidestories, but I wouldn't call most of the free SSRs good. FGO has some decent welfares - Chloe, Kintoki, Shiki etc, but also some mediocre ones. GBF had... few. Very few.

Eternals/Arcanum are technically F2P so I guess they count and most of them are very good, but to fully upgrade them takes VERY long time to grind out.
                        Arcarum (No 'N' in it :) ) is hard time gated yeah (though honestly so are the good FGO welfares if you missed the first run), but Eternals aren't really THAT hard to get.  Sure it takes some work, but having a few at 5* in under a year is definitely feasible.  I just got 5* Eahta and I've only been playing since the anniversary event.  And I stopped for a few months in the middle there.  I twenty boxed the last GW for Tien, and I'm going to finish it out in this next one.  If you want a real F2P grind, take a look at DBZ Dokkan Battle.  That shit is terrible.

There's also the fact that Granblue gives out a TON more free draws than FGO.  Throw in the sparking system, and you're basically guaranteed a couple of top tier units.  Then there's the fact that most of your strength in this game comes from your grid, which is almost entirely F2P.  Even if you have pretty crappy characters, you can continue to progress because a lot of your power comes from farming weapons.
                            Yeah, 5* isn't as hard as it used to be, but I was mostly referring to the "final" upgrade that was released recently.

Granblue does give a lot more draws, but imagine if you didn't *need* those draws and could use your favorite SRs and succeed as you do with SSRs.

Nevermind that Granblue *does* have multiplayer element, meaning you not having SSRs does mean you will not contribute during Guild Wars as much as other people and during multiplayer fights you have smaller chances to get high enough score to get bonus chest...

>Then there's the fact that most of your strength in this game comes from your grid, which is almost entirely F2P.

Debatable. You CAN do F2P, but other than very grind-intense double Magna grids you still need an elemental summon, right? I think that hasn't changed since I stopped playing - few grids can handle double Magna as it is.
                                >You CAN do F2P, but other than very grind-intense double Magna grids you still need an elemental summon, right? 

I think the part you're forgetting is the second summon is a support summon.  You absolutely don't need to own it yourself.  I certainly don't own a Lucifer, and my Bahamut is nowhere close to ULB.  It's like borrowing your buddy's Merlin/Skadi in FGO.  And it's preferable to have them as a support summon as well, because support summons can always be called turn 1, no matter what their cooldown is.

Also they just boosted the drop rate for M2.  They've also just started running drop rate events.  I've literally went from almost no M2 weapons to all full M2 grids in the past few weeks.
            "Being able to clear the game" doesn't make a game f2p-friendly, just f2p-capable. You're still a second-class citizen.
                You're a second class citizen in every gacha game you don't pay in tbh, that's just the nature of how they work.
                    But some moreso than others. I've never felt like that in Azur Lane, for example- whatever its other failings, even as a F2P player you get way more characters to play around with than you can ever use, and the only thing to spend money on is dresses to make your girls look even prettier.  FGO might not nickel-and-dime you like some other games (looking at you, E7), but that's because it doesn't even care about giving good value to the people who DO whale. The gacha is cruel and that's just how they like it.
            Well, if you're talking about low rarity stuff

You're right.

But in my experience, while in FGO you "can" clear hard challenge quest with low rarity, it still very tedious to say the least.

While in GBF it's very tedious to just use low rarity, you can't outright clear harder content with low rarity.

But GBF also did give away SSR character for free, including farmable one, that can be use to clear hardest content in the game, provided you have good grid.

So, all in all, both are almost the same? But GBF is giving more.

And yes, I'm totally bias toward GBF.

But I've also been playing both game for years, FGO was even longer than GBF

And I still feel like I need to roll that 4 main support to make my life easier in FGO, while painfully farming event repeatedly (and sometime free quest for very hard to drop mats)

while in GBF I just took it easy, farming stuffs as I want, collecting pendent weekly to exchange for weapons, then collecting free crystal for spark, and I've spark for about 7 times now.

So, yeah, I still think GBF is much more friendly to F2P players than FGO.
            Yeah FGO is in this weird zone where while the gacha definitely isn't F2P, the wellfare resources definitely are. 

Theyre so good that you can argue FGO's deliberatley fucks over the gacha especially considering how consistently the gacha release of FGO have been rather bad whereas wellfares always sits on "really really good" or "ridiculously overpowered". The sheer disparity between the 2 version of Yu should have been a good tell to how FGO does their thing

Its honestly sometimes hard to feel motivated to save up for servant in FGO, gameplay wise since you just knew they would get fucked over just because theyre not free(or Anni feature) >_>
                Hey now, FGO has some really good welfares (Shiki, BB, Kuro, Mecha Liz, Ruler Quetz, Jaltzerker, Kagetora), a single broken one (Kintoki), but the vast majority of them are lost in the sea of "mediocre, but niche/workable" (Sieg, Chacha, Janta, Rider Ishtar, Assassin Scathach, Ryouma, Nobu, etc) and a couple terrible ones (Iri, Brave Liz, Saber Lily, Bunyan).
        Necessitating certain gacha units for clears unless you ludicrously outgrid them makes GBF *much* less f2p friendly. Not to mention there's actual competition in GBF with guildwars. Exacerbating this issue is the amount of time nearly everything worth doing in GBF has to be farmed ad nauseum. Even if not having the right units for something might cause you to take double the amount of time to clear something in FGO, you would still be spending an insane amount more time in GBF because it demands that much more of you.

FGO is more f2p friendly to me because:

* The average player can be reasonably be expected to clear challenge content

* The power creep is relatively low meaning you don't have to be getting new units constantly to keep up

* The amount of time to farm events is comparatively very low making chase units less mandatory

* Most importantly, there's no competition that pits f2p users against people that spend money
            > The average player can be reasonably be expected to clear challenge content

The same goes for GBF, with *commensurately* similar time invested. A newbie a week in FGO won't be able to clear challenge quests, a newbie a month old in GBF won't be able to attempt Proud quests. Give the FGO player a month and the GBF player a year (or at least half) and they'll still be at similar stages of progression. GBF is a *bigger* game, that has no impact on its F2P status.

>The power creep is relatively low meaning you don't have to be getting new units constantly to keep up

Both games have the same amount of power creep, imo. There are terrible or powercreeped year 1 units in both (Saber Altera, Alexander the Great vs Carmellina, Forte) and both games consistently go back and buff aforementioned old units (Artoria, Sanzang, Zeta, Olivia). If anything GBF does this more because you're "guaranteed" that any 4* SSRs will, eventually, get a 5* to increase their abilities.

>The amount of time to farm events is comparatively very low making chase units less mandatory

Farming in FGO is "have a Waver or suffer", to say nothing of Merlin, Skadi and Castoria (all very limited Servants, btw) so this argument is bullshit.

>Most importantly, there's no competition that pits f2p users against people that spend money

That part is true, at least.
                > The same goes for GBF, with commensurately similar time invested.

This is really, really not true. You can 100% get a full set of useful characters to max level and their skills reasonably leveled within a month for GBF to complete challenge quests. Especially if you don't mind spending command seals. You definitely cannot be ready to fight Luci HL within even a couple months without serious no lifing.

>Both games have the same amount of power creep, imo.

100% no. I don't think anyone reasonable would agree with this. Meta units coming out completely blow away units coming out the years previous. Using Saber Altera is in no way even remotely comparable to trying to use Carmelina. 

Also, putting aside the GBF vs FGO thing, the idea that you're "guaranteed" a 5* in any character is complete bollocks. 

>Farming in FGO is "have a Waver or suffer", to say nothing of Merlin, Skadi and Castoria (all very limited Servants, btw) so this argument is bullshit.

So use a friend's. I also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary.  I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

There's a number of decent excellent f2p farming units like Arash and Spartacus. It's not "have these limited units or you have literally nothing."
                    >This is really, really not true. You can 100% get a full set of useful characters to max level and their skills reasonably leveled within a month for GBF to complete challenge quests. Especially if you don't mind spending command seals. You definitely cannot be ready to fight Luci HL within even a couple months without serious no lifing.


I said "commensurate" time invested, not "same" time invested. Google that if you don't know what the word means.

>100% no. I don't think anyone reasonable would agree with this. Meta units coming out completely blow away units coming out the years previous. Using Saber Altera is in no way even remotely comparable to trying to use Carmelina.

Both are serviceable, both are ultimately bottom tier compared to most of their peers. Carmellina being comparatively worse than, say, Grimnir than Saber Altera is to Musashi is also made up by the fact that Carmelina (or any other SSR) is far easier to acquire in GBF than it would be in FGO. In FGO, you might be stuck with that Altera as your only SSR Saber for a year if you're only mildly unlucky; in GBF you can GUARANTEE getting a Grimnir or better yet an Andira within a few months.

>Also, putting aside the GBF vs FGO thing, the idea that you're "guaranteed" a 5* in any character is complete bollocks.

We know every 4* SSR in GBF will eventually get a fifth star, the question is simply how far in the future and how good it will be when it comes.


>So use a friend's. I also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary. I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

Using a friend's Waver is far more limiting than having your own, especially since most popular farming strats include having at least two meta supports (Waver/Waver, Waver/Merlin, then later Skadi/Skadi and even later on Castoria/Castoria). For harder quests, you're faced with the choice of either using a support Caster or actually picking the DPS you need for a particular fight if you don't happen to have it. FGO having no grids and no MC abilities beyond the intentionally limited scope of the Mystic Codes means you're that much more reliant on units for any setup, and that's a fact.

> also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary. I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

Because that has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a game is F2P or not. GBF is a much grindier game, no dispute there.


>There's a number of decent excellent f2p farming units like Arash and Spartacus. It's not "have these limited units or you have literally nothing."

And they're still irrelevant if you don't have a Kscope or at least an Imaginary Element. Even if you could make efficient 3-turn setups FOR THE MAJORITY OF CONTENT without any limited SSRs, the gacha also limits you in what Craft Essences you get, and potentially even worse since specific Craft Essences are never on rateup.
                        >And they're still irrelevant if you don't have a Kscope or at least an Imaginary Element.

I'm honestly questioning whether you've played the game or not at this point. Arash and Spartacus are amazing *because* they don't require kaleidoscope. There are a TON of events that give you +50% NP gauge at the start. You can easily get them to 80% and them top them off with Waver while still giving 30% to whoever's switching in for Arash.

>Because that has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a game is F2P or not. GBF is a much grindier game, no dispute there.

It's 100% relevant.  Having poor units might cause an increase in your clear times by 100% for FGO but only 30% for GBF. That sounds really bad, but when you put actual numbers to it it's an increase of 3 hours to 6 hours for FGO but 15 to 20 hours in GBF. That makes a big difference. Time isn't infinite, and demanding more out of your players that don't cough up is inherently less f2p friendly.

>For harder quests, you're faced with the choice of either using a support Caster or actually picking the DPS you need for a particular fight if you don't happen to have it.

You don't need a specific DPS to clear FGO challenge fights. You don't even really need a specific support aside from the very challengiest of challenge fights. d

>Both are serviceable, both are ultimately bottom tier compared to most of their peers.

And yet the difference between bottom tier in FGO and GBF is leagues apart. Taking Heles into your challenge fights in GBF is just being a leech. Even Altera without interlude buffs would contribute significantly more.
                            Arash's battery is only 25%. You need either a Kscope or a 50% event CE (which are in fact, rare and becoming rarer still in the future) and another battery to bring him to 100% in order to NP wave 1 (which is the only thing he's good for). Spartacus' is 50%, but his damage is also commensurately lower- very good for his rarity, but you couldn't use him, for example, to farm the recent Gilfest's mobs. 

Having sub-optimal units plays a comparatively small part (compared to summon and grid strength) when it comes to fast clears in GBF. Not having a very few very specific limited characters in FGO makes or breaks farming teams.

Now I'm the one who has to question whether you've player FGO at this point. There have been in the past (and are yet to come in the future, at least to NA) numerous CQ's blatantly pandering to specific recently-released units.


I already made my point re: availability and capacity for upgrades of old GBF units vs old FGO ones. Have fun waiting for Salter to become relevant again in 2022.
                                > Arash's battery is only 25%

[No, it's definitely not](https://imgur.com/a/KWbMwZ3). If you've never been around for an event with a 50% CE, then you can use Dragon Meridian, which is a 3* essence available in the FP gacha.

>Having sub-optimal units plays a comparatively small part (compared to summon and grid strength) when it comes to fast clears in GBF. Not having a very few very specific limited characters in FGO makes or breaks farming teams.

I'm not really sure how you can say this when 6 dragon raids practically live or die whether you have the right units. Have you tried doing Wadmus without any limited units? It's extraordinarily painful.

>Now I'm the one who has to question whether you've player FGO at this point. There have been in the past (and are yet to come in the future, at least to NA) numerous CQ's blatantly pandering to specific recently-released units.

That's really completely irrelevant to any points I was making. Never did I say there weren't top tier or pandered units in FGO.

>I already made my point re: availability and capacity for upgrades of old GBF units vs old FGO ones. Have fun waiting for Salter to become relevant again in 2022.

As opposed to Heles or Chat who've been unviable for around 4 years despite various rebalances?

At the end of the day, a game that makes you compete against other players who can gain an advantage over you by spending money is most definitely less f2p than what's essentially a single player game with really shitty DLC practices.

Regardless of how generous Cygames is with all their properties, players willing to spend money have a definite advantage over those that don't.
    Bullshit

I only got 1 5 star from that game and i played for a year.
    Fam, this is a joke. Azur Lane (where you can easily have a 100% collection just playing the game) is f2p friendly. GFL, same (though you use the same resources to build as you need to sortie). GBF with all its roulettes and shit is very f2p friendly. But FGO? Not even close. You CAN play it as an f2p and even have a pretty good collection if you're lucky, but you will always be a second class citizen and you will always live knowing if the gacha decides you won't get a unit, you can literally bankrupt yourself and never get that unit. FGO's gacha is among the worst scams in the industry, the game's only gotten as big as it has because of the awesome story.
        >you will always be a second class citizen

Holy living hyperbole lmao. It's a single player RPG. 

>you can literally bankrupt yourself and never get that unit

This is a personal problem. You don't ever need "that unit." Cu Chulainn himself is more than enough to get through like 95% of content if you grail him.

>FGO's gacha is among the worst scams in the industry, the game's only gotten as big as it has because of the awesome story.

Or maybe it's actually a fun game, and there's a reason one can enjoy it and GBF.

Yeah the gacha rates are awful. Among the worst in the industry, but that has nothing to do with how f2p it is when the units available for free are very powerful.
I only got 1 5 star from that game and I played for 3 months on and off for a year. 

Never went back to FGO and stickes to GBF and SV for my mobile games
On mobile, my genshin is 6.81 while honkai 3rd is 6.67. Memoria freese is 9.62gb, and Dragalia is 7.67gb
    Dragalia let's you delete old story data now, which can clear up nearly 3 gigs
For some reason Honkai doesn't delete old CGs for me, so the size went once to 12gb for me until I deleted that video folder.
    ooh, you can manually delete those?
        Yes, navigate to android/data/com.mihoyo.bh3global/files/assets/videos and delete everything there. When needed, for example, you want to rewatch CGs for Sakura Samsara, you can redownload it by entering SS menu.
            Thanks!
I don't think we should let the mainstream population know this game exists, it will break a lot of things...
    wait until the global release comes out, its gonna be a right shitshow.

Unfortunately we still have no date for it beyond "it's coming after the JP release" which came out a few months ago.
        They're still going to get the censored version instead of LO at FULL POWER
            Well every version of LO has been censored on the playstore because google is shit, you have to download the uncensored APK off their website to get LO in its full glory.
    Whats Up with last origin?
        After a quick Google search from my part i can say with certainty the following: Tits, tits are what is up last origin,  you can tell just from the screenshots that the game is the result of some advanced horniness.
Because it has cross-save and being able to go right from PC to your phone is magic.
    Even better !
Because I don’t have a PS4 and my laptop sounds like a jet engine when I tried to play it
    Yeah sure, It was implicit in my comment that you need a decent PC for it
If you try to play genshin impact on phone it'll heat up to the point where you phone deactivates by itself
FEH hurts your wallet. Dragalia makes you bop.
??? is Honkai Impact 3rd, the previous game from the devs of Genshin
What do you have against azur lane
    I hate excessive fan service
        then stay away from the fan artists
rng happens that is all you can have the perfect comp with the perfect gear on each ship and still go the complete wrong way or get insta-gibbed by a random DD
    or have a perfectly healthy fleet at night battle and the boss is one cut-in away from kill, but none of your ships target the boss
        Or you could have the perfect comp, perfect set up, get to night battles on the last boss after 10 minutes of other battles, get a perfect cut in attack on your last ship and not kill the fucking boss with the cut in crit leaving the boss at 2HP. AHHHHHHHH
            Sparkle all your ships, first node one ship goes into the red
                Gotta sparkle them, gotta ring them to boost stats, gotta use the event gear that hopefully you kept from 3 months ago and didn't take break from, and a single bad RNG means you gotta go repair them, spend buckets, sparkle again GOD DAMN IM GLAD I QUIT THAT GAME
                Jesus christ I forgot about sparkling 1-1, what a cancerous 7 year old mechanic
It also has perma-death IIRC, so if your wife ship sinks she's gone for ever.
    Hardcore mode in a gacha game... that's a new kind of sadism.
        Worse! They sell cash shop items to keep the ship from dying permanently.

In fairness, there's also a "if the ship is not severely damaged, it can't be lost" mechanic - so it's not like the game just goes "lol, stars aligned, your waifu is gone for good". But it means that effectively, if the enemies all decide to whomp on one of your ships and it takes severe damage, you're heading back to base; nothing you can win is remotely worth losing a high-leveled ship.

But a big part of it is that the navigation -within- areas is random. So you need to randomly go the right way (so as not to get into so many fights that attrition makes victory impossible), you need to win those fights with your ships randomly targeting the enemy and the enemy randomly targeting you, then hope you've got enough health left to finish off the boss and that your big hitters decide to -attack- the boss and not hammer a weak enemy ship with everything they've got...

And THEN you get to see if the thing you wanted randomly drops.

Oh, and you have to repair in between fights, by putting ships into the "dock" (i.e. a long bath) for real time - hours of real time if they're damaged enough, unless you use "instant repair" items.

Kancolle events are like GFL ones - you've got a relatively long time, real-time-wise, but even then it's not "how long did it take you to finish?" but "did you manage to finish?"
            It also means a single moment of lack of attention, or being distracted/sleepy and not noticing or remembering your ship was in the red AND PUSHING FORWARD with the mission meant losing a unit permanently. That's absolute bullshit.
        Kancolle's not a gacha game.  You farm ships either through missions or crafting.  

As for the permadeath, the only way for that to happen is if you're greedy.  It's ALWAYS possible to prevent permadeath.  Basically the mechanic is they have to "die" two fights in a row without you repairing them in between.  You can retreat from the mission if you lose a ship in the first fight.  

It's still not a good game for a variety of reasons.  Most of them RNG related.
            Doesn't matter if the perma-death is preventable or hard to fullfil the conditions for it to happen, the very fact that there even is a perma-death mechanic is bad in its own.
            Wait, don't Kancolle players need to farm materials, *then* use said materials to build a ship *and then* hope they get the ship they want? I know there are certain recipes which get a higher chance for certain ships but that isn't still gacha? Also, can't they paid get those materials needed without farming? Sounds a lot like a gacha game if you ask me
RNG game lol

All you can do is maximise everything and hope for the best.   
Literally can have everything perfect and fail 100s of times in a row due to bad luck, though obviously unlikely.
Kancolle events are like masturbating while tossing coin for 10 times head streaks, for each time u lose the streak, u must wait ur thing completely soft, even u nearly come out. 
And u need to come out exactly while u got the 10times streak.
when they started putting 2-3 phases into several stages effectively making 6-7 maps actually 10-11 that's when i knew shit had really hit the fan

enough of transport stages please
They also announced on the summer livestream that they would have more info on the December stream.
    They'll reveal in the December stream that they'll release the date for the announcement of the trailer at a later date.
        So the Persona/Atlus model
        Later date being the 2022 Summer livestream, where they will announce that Relink will have a PS5 port.
Yeah thats the problem. I think at this point, people can only just waiting for the trailer, instead of the game. Lol....
Ironing out kinks and PS5 are likely a factor. Plus they had a whole other game we didn't know about until months before it released.
    That was being made by a completely different company though.
        Fkhr and kmr were still heavily involved in both as fkhr was the main designer in how they fight.

They also moved the rest of the game in house for re:link which is extra work on top of running their multiple games.
Yeah and the rhythm aspect of the newer game (LL All Stars) is just....not fun. It became more of an idol collection game, which is fine but Starlight Light can balance between those two just fine.
IIRC PS4 version isn't terribly well optimized, and it's not exactly a new piece of hardware. Phone version is also not as good as PC but still lower graphics/requirements.
Pro is not much better. A lot of stutter and slowdown. Its just not optimized for the console...
It’s indeed a bug for iOS part, people were pointing it out way before Genshin released. Idk about PC tho, Valorant had the same problem when it released.
[deleted]
    They removed it when it was reported tho.
        should never have been there in the first place.
        They did not remove it. They claimed it will stop running when the program is turned off. For something on the kernel level that is a minor obstacle.
        Imagine if it was never reported.
            Nothing, look at Valorant, been doing it since beta.
No.

FGO is definitely not the most F2P out there.

I'd reckon Granblue (and Princess Connect, basically Cygame) that is the most F2P.

They give away so much that you basically never need to buy any crystal, if you want to spent some you'd buy a guaranteed ticket instead, same price plus you can select any character in that box.
    to be fair FGO is very f2p if you know what you are doing, unlike GBF where anything not SSR is instantly benched forever. low rarity stuff in FGO is still extremely powerful, they are just more specialized in what they do very well. One of the top end wave clear farmers in the game is a 1 star for perspective.

GBF is definitely more free to play, after how much stuff cygames just gave out I don't think that's up for debate, but saying FGO isn't very F2P is wrong, you can clear everything in the game without spending a dime. The gacha rates are terrible absolutely, but you honestly don't have to spend a dime and you can kill the final story boss no problems.
        You are correct - I don't remember an SR unit I'd use in GBF over SSRs, maybe except Mirin (Wind) and for some time, Sen until I got better team comp to use MC as DPS unit.

Meanwhile in FGO you can clear even challenge quests with free units, even if it means sometimes borrowing a secondary DPS or support from friends as backup.
            FGO has a couple of reasons that other rarities are good.  The biggest one is that there is a point limit on what you can put in your team.  The fact of the matter is you can't just put all SSR Servants and Craft Essences in your team. They simply won't fit.  SRs are also still pretty rare.  They're the same rate as GBF SSRs when it's not a gala.

With that said, I feel like you're ignoring that GBF also gives you a bunch of decent SSRs.  It's at least as welfare-y as FGO is, and unlike FGO, any new player has access to a lot of them.  In FGO, if you missed the event, well too bad.
                I mean... yeah, I like that GBF has many units you can get from event reruns or the sidestories, but I wouldn't call most of the free SSRs good. FGO has some decent welfares - Chloe, Kintoki, Shiki etc, but also some mediocre ones. GBF had... few. Very few.

Eternals/Arcanum are technically F2P so I guess they count and most of them are very good, but to fully upgrade them takes VERY long time to grind out.
                    Arcarum (No 'N' in it :) ) is hard time gated yeah (though honestly so are the good FGO welfares if you missed the first run), but Eternals aren't really THAT hard to get.  Sure it takes some work, but having a few at 5* in under a year is definitely feasible.  I just got 5* Eahta and I've only been playing since the anniversary event.  And I stopped for a few months in the middle there.  I twenty boxed the last GW for Tien, and I'm going to finish it out in this next one.  If you want a real F2P grind, take a look at DBZ Dokkan Battle.  That shit is terrible.

There's also the fact that Granblue gives out a TON more free draws than FGO.  Throw in the sparking system, and you're basically guaranteed a couple of top tier units.  Then there's the fact that most of your strength in this game comes from your grid, which is almost entirely F2P.  Even if you have pretty crappy characters, you can continue to progress because a lot of your power comes from farming weapons.
                        Yeah, 5* isn't as hard as it used to be, but I was mostly referring to the "final" upgrade that was released recently.

Granblue does give a lot more draws, but imagine if you didn't *need* those draws and could use your favorite SRs and succeed as you do with SSRs.

Nevermind that Granblue *does* have multiplayer element, meaning you not having SSRs does mean you will not contribute during Guild Wars as much as other people and during multiplayer fights you have smaller chances to get high enough score to get bonus chest...

>Then there's the fact that most of your strength in this game comes from your grid, which is almost entirely F2P.

Debatable. You CAN do F2P, but other than very grind-intense double Magna grids you still need an elemental summon, right? I think that hasn't changed since I stopped playing - few grids can handle double Magna as it is.
                            >You CAN do F2P, but other than very grind-intense double Magna grids you still need an elemental summon, right? 

I think the part you're forgetting is the second summon is a support summon.  You absolutely don't need to own it yourself.  I certainly don't own a Lucifer, and my Bahamut is nowhere close to ULB.  It's like borrowing your buddy's Merlin/Skadi in FGO.  And it's preferable to have them as a support summon as well, because support summons can always be called turn 1, no matter what their cooldown is.

Also they just boosted the drop rate for M2.  They've also just started running drop rate events.  I've literally went from almost no M2 weapons to all full M2 grids in the past few weeks.
        "Being able to clear the game" doesn't make a game f2p-friendly, just f2p-capable. You're still a second-class citizen.
            You're a second class citizen in every gacha game you don't pay in tbh, that's just the nature of how they work.
                But some moreso than others. I've never felt like that in Azur Lane, for example- whatever its other failings, even as a F2P player you get way more characters to play around with than you can ever use, and the only thing to spend money on is dresses to make your girls look even prettier.  FGO might not nickel-and-dime you like some other games (looking at you, E7), but that's because it doesn't even care about giving good value to the people who DO whale. The gacha is cruel and that's just how they like it.
        Well, if you're talking about low rarity stuff

You're right.

But in my experience, while in FGO you "can" clear hard challenge quest with low rarity, it still very tedious to say the least.

While in GBF it's very tedious to just use low rarity, you can't outright clear harder content with low rarity.

But GBF also did give away SSR character for free, including farmable one, that can be use to clear hardest content in the game, provided you have good grid.

So, all in all, both are almost the same? But GBF is giving more.

And yes, I'm totally bias toward GBF.

But I've also been playing both game for years, FGO was even longer than GBF

And I still feel like I need to roll that 4 main support to make my life easier in FGO, while painfully farming event repeatedly (and sometime free quest for very hard to drop mats)

while in GBF I just took it easy, farming stuffs as I want, collecting pendent weekly to exchange for weapons, then collecting free crystal for spark, and I've spark for about 7 times now.

So, yeah, I still think GBF is much more friendly to F2P players than FGO.
        Yeah FGO is in this weird zone where while the gacha definitely isn't F2P, the wellfare resources definitely are. 

Theyre so good that you can argue FGO's deliberatley fucks over the gacha especially considering how consistently the gacha release of FGO have been rather bad whereas wellfares always sits on "really really good" or "ridiculously overpowered". The sheer disparity between the 2 version of Yu should have been a good tell to how FGO does their thing

Its honestly sometimes hard to feel motivated to save up for servant in FGO, gameplay wise since you just knew they would get fucked over just because theyre not free(or Anni feature) >_>
            Hey now, FGO has some really good welfares (Shiki, BB, Kuro, Mecha Liz, Ruler Quetz, Jaltzerker, Kagetora), a single broken one (Kintoki), but the vast majority of them are lost in the sea of "mediocre, but niche/workable" (Sieg, Chacha, Janta, Rider Ishtar, Assassin Scathach, Ryouma, Nobu, etc) and a couple terrible ones (Iri, Brave Liz, Saber Lily, Bunyan).
    Necessitating certain gacha units for clears unless you ludicrously outgrid them makes GBF *much* less f2p friendly. Not to mention there's actual competition in GBF with guildwars. Exacerbating this issue is the amount of time nearly everything worth doing in GBF has to be farmed ad nauseum. Even if not having the right units for something might cause you to take double the amount of time to clear something in FGO, you would still be spending an insane amount more time in GBF because it demands that much more of you.

FGO is more f2p friendly to me because:

* The average player can be reasonably be expected to clear challenge content

* The power creep is relatively low meaning you don't have to be getting new units constantly to keep up

* The amount of time to farm events is comparatively very low making chase units less mandatory

* Most importantly, there's no competition that pits f2p users against people that spend money
        > The average player can be reasonably be expected to clear challenge content

The same goes for GBF, with *commensurately* similar time invested. A newbie a week in FGO won't be able to clear challenge quests, a newbie a month old in GBF won't be able to attempt Proud quests. Give the FGO player a month and the GBF player a year (or at least half) and they'll still be at similar stages of progression. GBF is a *bigger* game, that has no impact on its F2P status.

>The power creep is relatively low meaning you don't have to be getting new units constantly to keep up

Both games have the same amount of power creep, imo. There are terrible or powercreeped year 1 units in both (Saber Altera, Alexander the Great vs Carmellina, Forte) and both games consistently go back and buff aforementioned old units (Artoria, Sanzang, Zeta, Olivia). If anything GBF does this more because you're "guaranteed" that any 4* SSRs will, eventually, get a 5* to increase their abilities.

>The amount of time to farm events is comparatively very low making chase units less mandatory

Farming in FGO is "have a Waver or suffer", to say nothing of Merlin, Skadi and Castoria (all very limited Servants, btw) so this argument is bullshit.

>Most importantly, there's no competition that pits f2p users against people that spend money

That part is true, at least.
            > The same goes for GBF, with commensurately similar time invested.

This is really, really not true. You can 100% get a full set of useful characters to max level and their skills reasonably leveled within a month for GBF to complete challenge quests. Especially if you don't mind spending command seals. You definitely cannot be ready to fight Luci HL within even a couple months without serious no lifing.

>Both games have the same amount of power creep, imo.

100% no. I don't think anyone reasonable would agree with this. Meta units coming out completely blow away units coming out the years previous. Using Saber Altera is in no way even remotely comparable to trying to use Carmelina. 

Also, putting aside the GBF vs FGO thing, the idea that you're "guaranteed" a 5* in any character is complete bollocks. 

>Farming in FGO is "have a Waver or suffer", to say nothing of Merlin, Skadi and Castoria (all very limited Servants, btw) so this argument is bullshit.

So use a friend's. I also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary.  I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

There's a number of decent excellent f2p farming units like Arash and Spartacus. It's not "have these limited units or you have literally nothing."
                >This is really, really not true. You can 100% get a full set of useful characters to max level and their skills reasonably leveled within a month for GBF to complete challenge quests. Especially if you don't mind spending command seals. You definitely cannot be ready to fight Luci HL within even a couple months without serious no lifing.


I said "commensurate" time invested, not "same" time invested. Google that if you don't know what the word means.

>100% no. I don't think anyone reasonable would agree with this. Meta units coming out completely blow away units coming out the years previous. Using Saber Altera is in no way even remotely comparable to trying to use Carmelina.

Both are serviceable, both are ultimately bottom tier compared to most of their peers. Carmellina being comparatively worse than, say, Grimnir than Saber Altera is to Musashi is also made up by the fact that Carmelina (or any other SSR) is far easier to acquire in GBF than it would be in FGO. In FGO, you might be stuck with that Altera as your only SSR Saber for a year if you're only mildly unlucky; in GBF you can GUARANTEE getting a Grimnir or better yet an Andira within a few months.

>Also, putting aside the GBF vs FGO thing, the idea that you're "guaranteed" a 5* in any character is complete bollocks.

We know every 4* SSR in GBF will eventually get a fifth star, the question is simply how far in the future and how good it will be when it comes.


>So use a friend's. I also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary. I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

Using a friend's Waver is far more limiting than having your own, especially since most popular farming strats include having at least two meta supports (Waver/Waver, Waver/Merlin, then later Skadi/Skadi and even later on Castoria/Castoria). For harder quests, you're faced with the choice of either using a support Caster or actually picking the DPS you need for a particular fight if you don't happen to have it. FGO having no grids and no MC abilities beyond the intentionally limited scope of the Mystic Codes means you're that much more reliant on units for any setup, and that's a fact.

> also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary. I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

Because that has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a game is F2P or not. GBF is a much grindier game, no dispute there.


>There's a number of decent excellent f2p farming units like Arash and Spartacus. It's not "have these limited units or you have literally nothing."

And they're still irrelevant if you don't have a Kscope or at least an Imaginary Element. Even if you could make efficient 3-turn setups FOR THE MAJORITY OF CONTENT without any limited SSRs, the gacha also limits you in what Craft Essences you get, and potentially even worse since specific Craft Essences are never on rateup.
                    >And they're still irrelevant if you don't have a Kscope or at least an Imaginary Element.

I'm honestly questioning whether you've played the game or not at this point. Arash and Spartacus are amazing *because* they don't require kaleidoscope. There are a TON of events that give you +50% NP gauge at the start. You can easily get them to 80% and them top them off with Waver while still giving 30% to whoever's switching in for Arash.

>Because that has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a game is F2P or not. GBF is a much grindier game, no dispute there.

It's 100% relevant.  Having poor units might cause an increase in your clear times by 100% for FGO but only 30% for GBF. That sounds really bad, but when you put actual numbers to it it's an increase of 3 hours to 6 hours for FGO but 15 to 20 hours in GBF. That makes a big difference. Time isn't infinite, and demanding more out of your players that don't cough up is inherently less f2p friendly.

>For harder quests, you're faced with the choice of either using a support Caster or actually picking the DPS you need for a particular fight if you don't happen to have it.

You don't need a specific DPS to clear FGO challenge fights. You don't even really need a specific support aside from the very challengiest of challenge fights. d

>Both are serviceable, both are ultimately bottom tier compared to most of their peers.

And yet the difference between bottom tier in FGO and GBF is leagues apart. Taking Heles into your challenge fights in GBF is just being a leech. Even Altera without interlude buffs would contribute significantly more.
                        Arash's battery is only 25%. You need either a Kscope or a 50% event CE (which are in fact, rare and becoming rarer still in the future) and another battery to bring him to 100% in order to NP wave 1 (which is the only thing he's good for). Spartacus' is 50%, but his damage is also commensurately lower- very good for his rarity, but you couldn't use him, for example, to farm the recent Gilfest's mobs. 

Having sub-optimal units plays a comparatively small part (compared to summon and grid strength) when it comes to fast clears in GBF. Not having a very few very specific limited characters in FGO makes or breaks farming teams.

Now I'm the one who has to question whether you've player FGO at this point. There have been in the past (and are yet to come in the future, at least to NA) numerous CQ's blatantly pandering to specific recently-released units.


I already made my point re: availability and capacity for upgrades of old GBF units vs old FGO ones. Have fun waiting for Salter to become relevant again in 2022.
                            > Arash's battery is only 25%

[No, it's definitely not](https://imgur.com/a/KWbMwZ3). If you've never been around for an event with a 50% CE, then you can use Dragon Meridian, which is a 3* essence available in the FP gacha.

>Having sub-optimal units plays a comparatively small part (compared to summon and grid strength) when it comes to fast clears in GBF. Not having a very few very specific limited characters in FGO makes or breaks farming teams.

I'm not really sure how you can say this when 6 dragon raids practically live or die whether you have the right units. Have you tried doing Wadmus without any limited units? It's extraordinarily painful.

>Now I'm the one who has to question whether you've player FGO at this point. There have been in the past (and are yet to come in the future, at least to NA) numerous CQ's blatantly pandering to specific recently-released units.

That's really completely irrelevant to any points I was making. Never did I say there weren't top tier or pandered units in FGO.

>I already made my point re: availability and capacity for upgrades of old GBF units vs old FGO ones. Have fun waiting for Salter to become relevant again in 2022.

As opposed to Heles or Chat who've been unviable for around 4 years despite various rebalances?

At the end of the day, a game that makes you compete against other players who can gain an advantage over you by spending money is most definitely less f2p than what's essentially a single player game with really shitty DLC practices.

Regardless of how generous Cygames is with all their properties, players willing to spend money have a definite advantage over those that don't.
Bullshit

I only got 1 5 star from that game and i played for a year.
Fam, this is a joke. Azur Lane (where you can easily have a 100% collection just playing the game) is f2p friendly. GFL, same (though you use the same resources to build as you need to sortie). GBF with all its roulettes and shit is very f2p friendly. But FGO? Not even close. You CAN play it as an f2p and even have a pretty good collection if you're lucky, but you will always be a second class citizen and you will always live knowing if the gacha decides you won't get a unit, you can literally bankrupt yourself and never get that unit. FGO's gacha is among the worst scams in the industry, the game's only gotten as big as it has because of the awesome story.
    >you will always be a second class citizen

Holy living hyperbole lmao. It's a single player RPG. 

>you can literally bankrupt yourself and never get that unit

This is a personal problem. You don't ever need "that unit." Cu Chulainn himself is more than enough to get through like 95% of content if you grail him.

>FGO's gacha is among the worst scams in the industry, the game's only gotten as big as it has because of the awesome story.

Or maybe it's actually a fun game, and there's a reason one can enjoy it and GBF.

Yeah the gacha rates are awful. Among the worst in the industry, but that has nothing to do with how f2p it is when the units available for free are very powerful.
Dragalia let's you delete old story data now, which can clear up nearly 3 gigs
ooh, you can manually delete those?
    Yes, navigate to android/data/com.mihoyo.bh3global/files/assets/videos and delete everything there. When needed, for example, you want to rewatch CGs for Sakura Samsara, you can redownload it by entering SS menu.
        Thanks!
wait until the global release comes out, its gonna be a right shitshow.

Unfortunately we still have no date for it beyond "it's coming after the JP release" which came out a few months ago.
    They're still going to get the censored version instead of LO at FULL POWER
        Well every version of LO has been censored on the playstore because google is shit, you have to download the uncensored APK off their website to get LO in its full glory.
Whats Up with last origin?
    After a quick Google search from my part i can say with certainty the following: Tits, tits are what is up last origin,  you can tell just from the screenshots that the game is the result of some advanced horniness.
Even better !
Yeah sure, It was implicit in my comment that you need a decent PC for it
I hate excessive fan service
    then stay away from the fan artists
or have a perfectly healthy fleet at night battle and the boss is one cut-in away from kill, but none of your ships target the boss
    Or you could have the perfect comp, perfect set up, get to night battles on the last boss after 10 minutes of other battles, get a perfect cut in attack on your last ship and not kill the fucking boss with the cut in crit leaving the boss at 2HP. AHHHHHHHH
        Sparkle all your ships, first node one ship goes into the red
            Gotta sparkle them, gotta ring them to boost stats, gotta use the event gear that hopefully you kept from 3 months ago and didn't take break from, and a single bad RNG means you gotta go repair them, spend buckets, sparkle again GOD DAMN IM GLAD I QUIT THAT GAME
            Jesus christ I forgot about sparkling 1-1, what a cancerous 7 year old mechanic
Hardcore mode in a gacha game... that's a new kind of sadism.
    Worse! They sell cash shop items to keep the ship from dying permanently.

In fairness, there's also a "if the ship is not severely damaged, it can't be lost" mechanic - so it's not like the game just goes "lol, stars aligned, your waifu is gone for good". But it means that effectively, if the enemies all decide to whomp on one of your ships and it takes severe damage, you're heading back to base; nothing you can win is remotely worth losing a high-leveled ship.

But a big part of it is that the navigation -within- areas is random. So you need to randomly go the right way (so as not to get into so many fights that attrition makes victory impossible), you need to win those fights with your ships randomly targeting the enemy and the enemy randomly targeting you, then hope you've got enough health left to finish off the boss and that your big hitters decide to -attack- the boss and not hammer a weak enemy ship with everything they've got...

And THEN you get to see if the thing you wanted randomly drops.

Oh, and you have to repair in between fights, by putting ships into the "dock" (i.e. a long bath) for real time - hours of real time if they're damaged enough, unless you use "instant repair" items.

Kancolle events are like GFL ones - you've got a relatively long time, real-time-wise, but even then it's not "how long did it take you to finish?" but "did you manage to finish?"
        It also means a single moment of lack of attention, or being distracted/sleepy and not noticing or remembering your ship was in the red AND PUSHING FORWARD with the mission meant losing a unit permanently. That's absolute bullshit.
    Kancolle's not a gacha game.  You farm ships either through missions or crafting.  

As for the permadeath, the only way for that to happen is if you're greedy.  It's ALWAYS possible to prevent permadeath.  Basically the mechanic is they have to "die" two fights in a row without you repairing them in between.  You can retreat from the mission if you lose a ship in the first fight.  

It's still not a good game for a variety of reasons.  Most of them RNG related.
        Doesn't matter if the perma-death is preventable or hard to fullfil the conditions for it to happen, the very fact that there even is a perma-death mechanic is bad in its own.
        Wait, don't Kancolle players need to farm materials, *then* use said materials to build a ship *and then* hope they get the ship they want? I know there are certain recipes which get a higher chance for certain ships but that isn't still gacha? Also, can't they paid get those materials needed without farming? Sounds a lot like a gacha game if you ask me
They'll reveal in the December stream that they'll release the date for the announcement of the trailer at a later date.
    So the Persona/Atlus model
    Later date being the 2022 Summer livestream, where they will announce that Relink will have a PS5 port.
That was being made by a completely different company though.
    Fkhr and kmr were still heavily involved in both as fkhr was the main designer in how they fight.

They also moved the rest of the game in house for re:link which is extra work on top of running their multiple games.
They removed it when it was reported tho.
    should never have been there in the first place.
    They did not remove it. They claimed it will stop running when the program is turned off. For something on the kernel level that is a minor obstacle.
    Imagine if it was never reported.
        Nothing, look at Valorant, been doing it since beta.
to be fair FGO is very f2p if you know what you are doing, unlike GBF where anything not SSR is instantly benched forever. low rarity stuff in FGO is still extremely powerful, they are just more specialized in what they do very well. One of the top end wave clear farmers in the game is a 1 star for perspective.

GBF is definitely more free to play, after how much stuff cygames just gave out I don't think that's up for debate, but saying FGO isn't very F2P is wrong, you can clear everything in the game without spending a dime. The gacha rates are terrible absolutely, but you honestly don't have to spend a dime and you can kill the final story boss no problems.
    You are correct - I don't remember an SR unit I'd use in GBF over SSRs, maybe except Mirin (Wind) and for some time, Sen until I got better team comp to use MC as DPS unit.

Meanwhile in FGO you can clear even challenge quests with free units, even if it means sometimes borrowing a secondary DPS or support from friends as backup.
        FGO has a couple of reasons that other rarities are good.  The biggest one is that there is a point limit on what you can put in your team.  The fact of the matter is you can't just put all SSR Servants and Craft Essences in your team. They simply won't fit.  SRs are also still pretty rare.  They're the same rate as GBF SSRs when it's not a gala.

With that said, I feel like you're ignoring that GBF also gives you a bunch of decent SSRs.  It's at least as welfare-y as FGO is, and unlike FGO, any new player has access to a lot of them.  In FGO, if you missed the event, well too bad.
            I mean... yeah, I like that GBF has many units you can get from event reruns or the sidestories, but I wouldn't call most of the free SSRs good. FGO has some decent welfares - Chloe, Kintoki, Shiki etc, but also some mediocre ones. GBF had... few. Very few.

Eternals/Arcanum are technically F2P so I guess they count and most of them are very good, but to fully upgrade them takes VERY long time to grind out.
                Arcarum (No 'N' in it :) ) is hard time gated yeah (though honestly so are the good FGO welfares if you missed the first run), but Eternals aren't really THAT hard to get.  Sure it takes some work, but having a few at 5* in under a year is definitely feasible.  I just got 5* Eahta and I've only been playing since the anniversary event.  And I stopped for a few months in the middle there.  I twenty boxed the last GW for Tien, and I'm going to finish it out in this next one.  If you want a real F2P grind, take a look at DBZ Dokkan Battle.  That shit is terrible.

There's also the fact that Granblue gives out a TON more free draws than FGO.  Throw in the sparking system, and you're basically guaranteed a couple of top tier units.  Then there's the fact that most of your strength in this game comes from your grid, which is almost entirely F2P.  Even if you have pretty crappy characters, you can continue to progress because a lot of your power comes from farming weapons.
                    Yeah, 5* isn't as hard as it used to be, but I was mostly referring to the "final" upgrade that was released recently.

Granblue does give a lot more draws, but imagine if you didn't *need* those draws and could use your favorite SRs and succeed as you do with SSRs.

Nevermind that Granblue *does* have multiplayer element, meaning you not having SSRs does mean you will not contribute during Guild Wars as much as other people and during multiplayer fights you have smaller chances to get high enough score to get bonus chest...

>Then there's the fact that most of your strength in this game comes from your grid, which is almost entirely F2P.

Debatable. You CAN do F2P, but other than very grind-intense double Magna grids you still need an elemental summon, right? I think that hasn't changed since I stopped playing - few grids can handle double Magna as it is.
                        >You CAN do F2P, but other than very grind-intense double Magna grids you still need an elemental summon, right? 

I think the part you're forgetting is the second summon is a support summon.  You absolutely don't need to own it yourself.  I certainly don't own a Lucifer, and my Bahamut is nowhere close to ULB.  It's like borrowing your buddy's Merlin/Skadi in FGO.  And it's preferable to have them as a support summon as well, because support summons can always be called turn 1, no matter what their cooldown is.

Also they just boosted the drop rate for M2.  They've also just started running drop rate events.  I've literally went from almost no M2 weapons to all full M2 grids in the past few weeks.
    "Being able to clear the game" doesn't make a game f2p-friendly, just f2p-capable. You're still a second-class citizen.
        You're a second class citizen in every gacha game you don't pay in tbh, that's just the nature of how they work.
            But some moreso than others. I've never felt like that in Azur Lane, for example- whatever its other failings, even as a F2P player you get way more characters to play around with than you can ever use, and the only thing to spend money on is dresses to make your girls look even prettier.  FGO might not nickel-and-dime you like some other games (looking at you, E7), but that's because it doesn't even care about giving good value to the people who DO whale. The gacha is cruel and that's just how they like it.
    Well, if you're talking about low rarity stuff

You're right.

But in my experience, while in FGO you "can" clear hard challenge quest with low rarity, it still very tedious to say the least.

While in GBF it's very tedious to just use low rarity, you can't outright clear harder content with low rarity.

But GBF also did give away SSR character for free, including farmable one, that can be use to clear hardest content in the game, provided you have good grid.

So, all in all, both are almost the same? But GBF is giving more.

And yes, I'm totally bias toward GBF.

But I've also been playing both game for years, FGO was even longer than GBF

And I still feel like I need to roll that 4 main support to make my life easier in FGO, while painfully farming event repeatedly (and sometime free quest for very hard to drop mats)

while in GBF I just took it easy, farming stuffs as I want, collecting pendent weekly to exchange for weapons, then collecting free crystal for spark, and I've spark for about 7 times now.

So, yeah, I still think GBF is much more friendly to F2P players than FGO.
    Yeah FGO is in this weird zone where while the gacha definitely isn't F2P, the wellfare resources definitely are. 

Theyre so good that you can argue FGO's deliberatley fucks over the gacha especially considering how consistently the gacha release of FGO have been rather bad whereas wellfares always sits on "really really good" or "ridiculously overpowered". The sheer disparity between the 2 version of Yu should have been a good tell to how FGO does their thing

Its honestly sometimes hard to feel motivated to save up for servant in FGO, gameplay wise since you just knew they would get fucked over just because theyre not free(or Anni feature) >_>
        Hey now, FGO has some really good welfares (Shiki, BB, Kuro, Mecha Liz, Ruler Quetz, Jaltzerker, Kagetora), a single broken one (Kintoki), but the vast majority of them are lost in the sea of "mediocre, but niche/workable" (Sieg, Chacha, Janta, Rider Ishtar, Assassin Scathach, Ryouma, Nobu, etc) and a couple terrible ones (Iri, Brave Liz, Saber Lily, Bunyan).
Necessitating certain gacha units for clears unless you ludicrously outgrid them makes GBF *much* less f2p friendly. Not to mention there's actual competition in GBF with guildwars. Exacerbating this issue is the amount of time nearly everything worth doing in GBF has to be farmed ad nauseum. Even if not having the right units for something might cause you to take double the amount of time to clear something in FGO, you would still be spending an insane amount more time in GBF because it demands that much more of you.

FGO is more f2p friendly to me because:

* The average player can be reasonably be expected to clear challenge content

* The power creep is relatively low meaning you don't have to be getting new units constantly to keep up

* The amount of time to farm events is comparatively very low making chase units less mandatory

* Most importantly, there's no competition that pits f2p users against people that spend money
    > The average player can be reasonably be expected to clear challenge content

The same goes for GBF, with *commensurately* similar time invested. A newbie a week in FGO won't be able to clear challenge quests, a newbie a month old in GBF won't be able to attempt Proud quests. Give the FGO player a month and the GBF player a year (or at least half) and they'll still be at similar stages of progression. GBF is a *bigger* game, that has no impact on its F2P status.

>The power creep is relatively low meaning you don't have to be getting new units constantly to keep up

Both games have the same amount of power creep, imo. There are terrible or powercreeped year 1 units in both (Saber Altera, Alexander the Great vs Carmellina, Forte) and both games consistently go back and buff aforementioned old units (Artoria, Sanzang, Zeta, Olivia). If anything GBF does this more because you're "guaranteed" that any 4* SSRs will, eventually, get a 5* to increase their abilities.

>The amount of time to farm events is comparatively very low making chase units less mandatory

Farming in FGO is "have a Waver or suffer", to say nothing of Merlin, Skadi and Castoria (all very limited Servants, btw) so this argument is bullshit.

>Most importantly, there's no competition that pits f2p users against people that spend money

That part is true, at least.
        > The same goes for GBF, with commensurately similar time invested.

This is really, really not true. You can 100% get a full set of useful characters to max level and their skills reasonably leveled within a month for GBF to complete challenge quests. Especially if you don't mind spending command seals. You definitely cannot be ready to fight Luci HL within even a couple months without serious no lifing.

>Both games have the same amount of power creep, imo.

100% no. I don't think anyone reasonable would agree with this. Meta units coming out completely blow away units coming out the years previous. Using Saber Altera is in no way even remotely comparable to trying to use Carmelina. 

Also, putting aside the GBF vs FGO thing, the idea that you're "guaranteed" a 5* in any character is complete bollocks. 

>Farming in FGO is "have a Waver or suffer", to say nothing of Merlin, Skadi and Castoria (all very limited Servants, btw) so this argument is bullshit.

So use a friend's. I also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary.  I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

There's a number of decent excellent f2p farming units like Arash and Spartacus. It's not "have these limited units or you have literally nothing."
            >This is really, really not true. You can 100% get a full set of useful characters to max level and their skills reasonably leveled within a month for GBF to complete challenge quests. Especially if you don't mind spending command seals. You definitely cannot be ready to fight Luci HL within even a couple months without serious no lifing.


I said "commensurate" time invested, not "same" time invested. Google that if you don't know what the word means.

>100% no. I don't think anyone reasonable would agree with this. Meta units coming out completely blow away units coming out the years previous. Using Saber Altera is in no way even remotely comparable to trying to use Carmelina.

Both are serviceable, both are ultimately bottom tier compared to most of their peers. Carmellina being comparatively worse than, say, Grimnir than Saber Altera is to Musashi is also made up by the fact that Carmelina (or any other SSR) is far easier to acquire in GBF than it would be in FGO. In FGO, you might be stuck with that Altera as your only SSR Saber for a year if you're only mildly unlucky; in GBF you can GUARANTEE getting a Grimnir or better yet an Andira within a few months.

>Also, putting aside the GBF vs FGO thing, the idea that you're "guaranteed" a 5* in any character is complete bollocks.

We know every 4* SSR in GBF will eventually get a fifth star, the question is simply how far in the future and how good it will be when it comes.


>So use a friend's. I also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary. I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

Using a friend's Waver is far more limiting than having your own, especially since most popular farming strats include having at least two meta supports (Waver/Waver, Waver/Merlin, then later Skadi/Skadi and even later on Castoria/Castoria). For harder quests, you're faced with the choice of either using a support Caster or actually picking the DPS you need for a particular fight if you don't happen to have it. FGO having no grids and no MC abilities beyond the intentionally limited scope of the Mystic Codes means you're that much more reliant on units for any setup, and that's a fact.

> also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary. I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

Because that has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a game is F2P or not. GBF is a much grindier game, no dispute there.


>There's a number of decent excellent f2p farming units like Arash and Spartacus. It's not "have these limited units or you have literally nothing."

And they're still irrelevant if you don't have a Kscope or at least an Imaginary Element. Even if you could make efficient 3-turn setups FOR THE MAJORITY OF CONTENT without any limited SSRs, the gacha also limits you in what Craft Essences you get, and potentially even worse since specific Craft Essences are never on rateup.
                >And they're still irrelevant if you don't have a Kscope or at least an Imaginary Element.

I'm honestly questioning whether you've played the game or not at this point. Arash and Spartacus are amazing *because* they don't require kaleidoscope. There are a TON of events that give you +50% NP gauge at the start. You can easily get them to 80% and them top them off with Waver while still giving 30% to whoever's switching in for Arash.

>Because that has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a game is F2P or not. GBF is a much grindier game, no dispute there.

It's 100% relevant.  Having poor units might cause an increase in your clear times by 100% for FGO but only 30% for GBF. That sounds really bad, but when you put actual numbers to it it's an increase of 3 hours to 6 hours for FGO but 15 to 20 hours in GBF. That makes a big difference. Time isn't infinite, and demanding more out of your players that don't cough up is inherently less f2p friendly.

>For harder quests, you're faced with the choice of either using a support Caster or actually picking the DPS you need for a particular fight if you don't happen to have it.

You don't need a specific DPS to clear FGO challenge fights. You don't even really need a specific support aside from the very challengiest of challenge fights. d

>Both are serviceable, both are ultimately bottom tier compared to most of their peers.

And yet the difference between bottom tier in FGO and GBF is leagues apart. Taking Heles into your challenge fights in GBF is just being a leech. Even Altera without interlude buffs would contribute significantly more.
                    Arash's battery is only 25%. You need either a Kscope or a 50% event CE (which are in fact, rare and becoming rarer still in the future) and another battery to bring him to 100% in order to NP wave 1 (which is the only thing he's good for). Spartacus' is 50%, but his damage is also commensurately lower- very good for his rarity, but you couldn't use him, for example, to farm the recent Gilfest's mobs. 

Having sub-optimal units plays a comparatively small part (compared to summon and grid strength) when it comes to fast clears in GBF. Not having a very few very specific limited characters in FGO makes or breaks farming teams.

Now I'm the one who has to question whether you've player FGO at this point. There have been in the past (and are yet to come in the future, at least to NA) numerous CQ's blatantly pandering to specific recently-released units.


I already made my point re: availability and capacity for upgrades of old GBF units vs old FGO ones. Have fun waiting for Salter to become relevant again in 2022.
                        > Arash's battery is only 25%

[No, it's definitely not](https://imgur.com/a/KWbMwZ3). If you've never been around for an event with a 50% CE, then you can use Dragon Meridian, which is a 3* essence available in the FP gacha.

>Having sub-optimal units plays a comparatively small part (compared to summon and grid strength) when it comes to fast clears in GBF. Not having a very few very specific limited characters in FGO makes or breaks farming teams.

I'm not really sure how you can say this when 6 dragon raids practically live or die whether you have the right units. Have you tried doing Wadmus without any limited units? It's extraordinarily painful.

>Now I'm the one who has to question whether you've player FGO at this point. There have been in the past (and are yet to come in the future, at least to NA) numerous CQ's blatantly pandering to specific recently-released units.

That's really completely irrelevant to any points I was making. Never did I say there weren't top tier or pandered units in FGO.

As opposed to Heles or Chat who've been unviable for around 4 years despite various rebalances?

At the end of the day, a game that makes you compete against other players who can gain an advantage over you by spending money is most definitely less f2p than what's essentially a single player game with really shitty DLC practices.

Regardless of how generous Cygames is with all their properties, players willing to spend money have a definite advantage over those that don't.
>you will always be a second class citizen

Holy living hyperbole lmao. It's a single player RPG. 

>you can literally bankrupt yourself and never get that unit

This is a personal problem. You don't ever need "that unit." Cu Chulainn himself is more than enough to get through like 95% of content if you grail him.

>FGO's gacha is among the worst scams in the industry, the game's only gotten as big as it has because of the awesome story.

Or maybe it's actually a fun game, and there's a reason one can enjoy it and GBF.

Yeah the gacha rates are awful. Among the worst in the industry, but that has nothing to do with how f2p it is when the units available for free are very powerful.
Yes, navigate to android/data/com.mihoyo.bh3global/files/assets/videos and delete everything there. When needed, for example, you want to rewatch CGs for Sakura Samsara, you can redownload it by entering SS menu.
    Thanks!
They're still going to get the censored version instead of LO at FULL POWER
    Well every version of LO has been censored on the playstore because google is shit, you have to download the uncensored APK off their website to get LO in its full glory.
After a quick Google search from my part i can say with certainty the following: Tits, tits are what is up last origin,  you can tell just from the screenshots that the game is the result of some advanced horniness.
then stay away from the fan artists
Or you could have the perfect comp, perfect set up, get to night battles on the last boss after 10 minutes of other battles, get a perfect cut in attack on your last ship and not kill the fucking boss with the cut in crit leaving the boss at 2HP. AHHHHHHHH
    Sparkle all your ships, first node one ship goes into the red
        Gotta sparkle them, gotta ring them to boost stats, gotta use the event gear that hopefully you kept from 3 months ago and didn't take break from, and a single bad RNG means you gotta go repair them, spend buckets, sparkle again GOD DAMN IM GLAD I QUIT THAT GAME
        Jesus christ I forgot about sparkling 1-1, what a cancerous 7 year old mechanic
Worse! They sell cash shop items to keep the ship from dying permanently.

In fairness, there's also a "if the ship is not severely damaged, it can't be lost" mechanic - so it's not like the game just goes "lol, stars aligned, your waifu is gone for good". But it means that effectively, if the enemies all decide to whomp on one of your ships and it takes severe damage, you're heading back to base; nothing you can win is remotely worth losing a high-leveled ship.

But a big part of it is that the navigation -within- areas is random. So you need to randomly go the right way (so as not to get into so many fights that attrition makes victory impossible), you need to win those fights with your ships randomly targeting the enemy and the enemy randomly targeting you, then hope you've got enough health left to finish off the boss and that your big hitters decide to -attack- the boss and not hammer a weak enemy ship with everything they've got...

And THEN you get to see if the thing you wanted randomly drops.

Oh, and you have to repair in between fights, by putting ships into the "dock" (i.e. a long bath) for real time - hours of real time if they're damaged enough, unless you use "instant repair" items.

Kancolle events are like GFL ones - you've got a relatively long time, real-time-wise, but even then it's not "how long did it take you to finish?" but "did you manage to finish?"
    It also means a single moment of lack of attention, or being distracted/sleepy and not noticing or remembering your ship was in the red AND PUSHING FORWARD with the mission meant losing a unit permanently. That's absolute bullshit.
Kancolle's not a gacha game.  You farm ships either through missions or crafting.  

As for the permadeath, the only way for that to happen is if you're greedy.  It's ALWAYS possible to prevent permadeath.  Basically the mechanic is they have to "die" two fights in a row without you repairing them in between.  You can retreat from the mission if you lose a ship in the first fight.  

It's still not a good game for a variety of reasons.  Most of them RNG related.
    Doesn't matter if the perma-death is preventable or hard to fullfil the conditions for it to happen, the very fact that there even is a perma-death mechanic is bad in its own.
    Wait, don't Kancolle players need to farm materials, *then* use said materials to build a ship *and then* hope they get the ship they want? I know there are certain recipes which get a higher chance for certain ships but that isn't still gacha? Also, can't they paid get those materials needed without farming? Sounds a lot like a gacha game if you ask me
So the Persona/Atlus model
Later date being the 2022 Summer livestream, where they will announce that Relink will have a PS5 port.
Fkhr and kmr were still heavily involved in both as fkhr was the main designer in how they fight.

They also moved the rest of the game in house for re:link which is extra work on top of running their multiple games.
should never have been there in the first place.
They did not remove it. They claimed it will stop running when the program is turned off. For something on the kernel level that is a minor obstacle.
Imagine if it was never reported.
    Nothing, look at Valorant, been doing it since beta.
You are correct - I don't remember an SR unit I'd use in GBF over SSRs, maybe except Mirin (Wind) and for some time, Sen until I got better team comp to use MC as DPS unit.

Meanwhile in FGO you can clear even challenge quests with free units, even if it means sometimes borrowing a secondary DPS or support from friends as backup.
    FGO has a couple of reasons that other rarities are good.  The biggest one is that there is a point limit on what you can put in your team.  The fact of the matter is you can't just put all SSR Servants and Craft Essences in your team. They simply won't fit.  SRs are also still pretty rare.  They're the same rate as GBF SSRs when it's not a gala.

With that said, I feel like you're ignoring that GBF also gives you a bunch of decent SSRs.  It's at least as welfare-y as FGO is, and unlike FGO, any new player has access to a lot of them.  In FGO, if you missed the event, well too bad.
        I mean... yeah, I like that GBF has many units you can get from event reruns or the sidestories, but I wouldn't call most of the free SSRs good. FGO has some decent welfares - Chloe, Kintoki, Shiki etc, but also some mediocre ones. GBF had... few. Very few.

Eternals/Arcanum are technically F2P so I guess they count and most of them are very good, but to fully upgrade them takes VERY long time to grind out.
            Arcarum (No 'N' in it :) ) is hard time gated yeah (though honestly so are the good FGO welfares if you missed the first run), but Eternals aren't really THAT hard to get.  Sure it takes some work, but having a few at 5* in under a year is definitely feasible.  I just got 5* Eahta and I've only been playing since the anniversary event.  And I stopped for a few months in the middle there.  I twenty boxed the last GW for Tien, and I'm going to finish it out in this next one.  If you want a real F2P grind, take a look at DBZ Dokkan Battle.  That shit is terrible.

There's also the fact that Granblue gives out a TON more free draws than FGO.  Throw in the sparking system, and you're basically guaranteed a couple of top tier units.  Then there's the fact that most of your strength in this game comes from your grid, which is almost entirely F2P.  Even if you have pretty crappy characters, you can continue to progress because a lot of your power comes from farming weapons.
                Yeah, 5* isn't as hard as it used to be, but I was mostly referring to the "final" upgrade that was released recently.

Granblue does give a lot more draws, but imagine if you didn't *need* those draws and could use your favorite SRs and succeed as you do with SSRs.

Nevermind that Granblue *does* have multiplayer element, meaning you not having SSRs does mean you will not contribute during Guild Wars as much as other people and during multiplayer fights you have smaller chances to get high enough score to get bonus chest...

>Then there's the fact that most of your strength in this game comes from your grid, which is almost entirely F2P.

Debatable. You CAN do F2P, but other than very grind-intense double Magna grids you still need an elemental summon, right? I think that hasn't changed since I stopped playing - few grids can handle double Magna as it is.
                    >You CAN do F2P, but other than very grind-intense double Magna grids you still need an elemental summon, right? 

I think the part you're forgetting is the second summon is a support summon.  You absolutely don't need to own it yourself.  I certainly don't own a Lucifer, and my Bahamut is nowhere close to ULB.  It's like borrowing your buddy's Merlin/Skadi in FGO.  And it's preferable to have them as a support summon as well, because support summons can always be called turn 1, no matter what their cooldown is.

Also they just boosted the drop rate for M2.  They've also just started running drop rate events.  I've literally went from almost no M2 weapons to all full M2 grids in the past few weeks.
"Being able to clear the game" doesn't make a game f2p-friendly, just f2p-capable. You're still a second-class citizen.
    You're a second class citizen in every gacha game you don't pay in tbh, that's just the nature of how they work.
        But some moreso than others. I've never felt like that in Azur Lane, for example- whatever its other failings, even as a F2P player you get way more characters to play around with than you can ever use, and the only thing to spend money on is dresses to make your girls look even prettier.  FGO might not nickel-and-dime you like some other games (looking at you, E7), but that's because it doesn't even care about giving good value to the people who DO whale. The gacha is cruel and that's just how they like it.
Well, if you're talking about low rarity stuff

You're right.

But in my experience, while in FGO you "can" clear hard challenge quest with low rarity, it still very tedious to say the least.

While in GBF it's very tedious to just use low rarity, you can't outright clear harder content with low rarity.

But GBF also did give away SSR character for free, including farmable one, that can be use to clear hardest content in the game, provided you have good grid.

So, all in all, both are almost the same? But GBF is giving more.

And yes, I'm totally bias toward GBF.

But I've also been playing both game for years, FGO was even longer than GBF

And I still feel like I need to roll that 4 main support to make my life easier in FGO, while painfully farming event repeatedly (and sometime free quest for very hard to drop mats)

while in GBF I just took it easy, farming stuffs as I want, collecting pendent weekly to exchange for weapons, then collecting free crystal for spark, and I've spark for about 7 times now.

So, yeah, I still think GBF is much more friendly to F2P players than FGO.
Yeah FGO is in this weird zone where while the gacha definitely isn't F2P, the wellfare resources definitely are. 

Theyre so good that you can argue FGO's deliberatley fucks over the gacha especially considering how consistently the gacha release of FGO have been rather bad whereas wellfares always sits on "really really good" or "ridiculously overpowered". The sheer disparity between the 2 version of Yu should have been a good tell to how FGO does their thing

Its honestly sometimes hard to feel motivated to save up for servant in FGO, gameplay wise since you just knew they would get fucked over just because theyre not free(or Anni feature) >_>
    Hey now, FGO has some really good welfares (Shiki, BB, Kuro, Mecha Liz, Ruler Quetz, Jaltzerker, Kagetora), a single broken one (Kintoki), but the vast majority of them are lost in the sea of "mediocre, but niche/workable" (Sieg, Chacha, Janta, Rider Ishtar, Assassin Scathach, Ryouma, Nobu, etc) and a couple terrible ones (Iri, Brave Liz, Saber Lily, Bunyan).
> The average player can be reasonably be expected to clear challenge content

The same goes for GBF, with *commensurately* similar time invested. A newbie a week in FGO won't be able to clear challenge quests, a newbie a month old in GBF won't be able to attempt Proud quests. Give the FGO player a month and the GBF player a year (or at least half) and they'll still be at similar stages of progression. GBF is a *bigger* game, that has no impact on its F2P status.

>The power creep is relatively low meaning you don't have to be getting new units constantly to keep up

Both games have the same amount of power creep, imo. There are terrible or powercreeped year 1 units in both (Saber Altera, Alexander the Great vs Carmellina, Forte) and both games consistently go back and buff aforementioned old units (Artoria, Sanzang, Zeta, Olivia). If anything GBF does this more because you're "guaranteed" that any 4* SSRs will, eventually, get a 5* to increase their abilities.

>The amount of time to farm events is comparatively very low making chase units less mandatory

Farming in FGO is "have a Waver or suffer", to say nothing of Merlin, Skadi and Castoria (all very limited Servants, btw) so this argument is bullshit.

>Most importantly, there's no competition that pits f2p users against people that spend money

That part is true, at least.
    > The same goes for GBF, with commensurately similar time invested.

This is really, really not true. You can 100% get a full set of useful characters to max level and their skills reasonably leveled within a month for GBF to complete challenge quests. Especially if you don't mind spending command seals. You definitely cannot be ready to fight Luci HL within even a couple months without serious no lifing.

>Both games have the same amount of power creep, imo.

100% no. I don't think anyone reasonable would agree with this. Meta units coming out completely blow away units coming out the years previous. Using Saber Altera is in no way even remotely comparable to trying to use Carmelina. 

Also, putting aside the GBF vs FGO thing, the idea that you're "guaranteed" a 5* in any character is complete bollocks. 

>Farming in FGO is "have a Waver or suffer", to say nothing of Merlin, Skadi and Castoria (all very limited Servants, btw) so this argument is bullshit.

So use a friend's. I also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary.  I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

There's a number of decent excellent f2p farming units like Arash and Spartacus. It's not "have these limited units or you have literally nothing."
        >This is really, really not true. You can 100% get a full set of useful characters to max level and their skills reasonably leveled within a month for GBF to complete challenge quests. Especially if you don't mind spending command seals. You definitely cannot be ready to fight Luci HL within even a couple months without serious no lifing.


I said "commensurate" time invested, not "same" time invested. Google that if you don't know what the word means.

>100% no. I don't think anyone reasonable would agree with this. Meta units coming out completely blow away units coming out the years previous. Using Saber Altera is in no way even remotely comparable to trying to use Carmelina.

Both are serviceable, both are ultimately bottom tier compared to most of their peers. Carmellina being comparatively worse than, say, Grimnir than Saber Altera is to Musashi is also made up by the fact that Carmelina (or any other SSR) is far easier to acquire in GBF than it would be in FGO. In FGO, you might be stuck with that Altera as your only SSR Saber for a year if you're only mildly unlucky; in GBF you can GUARANTEE getting a Grimnir or better yet an Andira within a few months.

>Also, putting aside the GBF vs FGO thing, the idea that you're "guaranteed" a 5* in any character is complete bollocks.

We know every 4* SSR in GBF will eventually get a fifth star, the question is simply how far in the future and how good it will be when it comes.


>So use a friend's. I also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary. I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

Using a friend's Waver is far more limiting than having your own, especially since most popular farming strats include having at least two meta supports (Waver/Waver, Waver/Merlin, then later Skadi/Skadi and even later on Castoria/Castoria). For harder quests, you're faced with the choice of either using a support Caster or actually picking the DPS you need for a particular fight if you don't happen to have it. FGO having no grids and no MC abilities beyond the intentionally limited scope of the Mystic Codes means you're that much more reliant on units for any setup, and that's a fact.

> also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary. I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

Because that has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a game is F2P or not. GBF is a much grindier game, no dispute there.


>There's a number of decent excellent f2p farming units like Arash and Spartacus. It's not "have these limited units or you have literally nothing."

And they're still irrelevant if you don't have a Kscope or at least an Imaginary Element. Even if you could make efficient 3-turn setups FOR THE MAJORITY OF CONTENT without any limited SSRs, the gacha also limits you in what Craft Essences you get, and potentially even worse since specific Craft Essences are never on rateup.
            >And they're still irrelevant if you don't have a Kscope or at least an Imaginary Element.

I'm honestly questioning whether you've played the game or not at this point. Arash and Spartacus are amazing *because* they don't require kaleidoscope. There are a TON of events that give you +50% NP gauge at the start. You can easily get them to 80% and them top them off with Waver while still giving 30% to whoever's switching in for Arash.

>Because that has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a game is F2P or not. GBF is a much grindier game, no dispute there.

It's 100% relevant.  Having poor units might cause an increase in your clear times by 100% for FGO but only 30% for GBF. That sounds really bad, but when you put actual numbers to it it's an increase of 3 hours to 6 hours for FGO but 15 to 20 hours in GBF. That makes a big difference. Time isn't infinite, and demanding more out of your players that don't cough up is inherently less f2p friendly.

>For harder quests, you're faced with the choice of either using a support Caster or actually picking the DPS you need for a particular fight if you don't happen to have it.

You don't need a specific DPS to clear FGO challenge fights. You don't even really need a specific support aside from the very challengiest of challenge fights. d

>Both are serviceable, both are ultimately bottom tier compared to most of their peers.

And yet the difference between bottom tier in FGO and GBF is leagues apart. Taking Heles into your challenge fights in GBF is just being a leech. Even Altera without interlude buffs would contribute significantly more.
                Arash's battery is only 25%. You need either a Kscope or a 50% event CE (which are in fact, rare and becoming rarer still in the future) and another battery to bring him to 100% in order to NP wave 1 (which is the only thing he's good for). Spartacus' is 50%, but his damage is also commensurately lower- very good for his rarity, but you couldn't use him, for example, to farm the recent Gilfest's mobs. 

Having sub-optimal units plays a comparatively small part (compared to summon and grid strength) when it comes to fast clears in GBF. Not having a very few very specific limited characters in FGO makes or breaks farming teams.

Now I'm the one who has to question whether you've player FGO at this point. There have been in the past (and are yet to come in the future, at least to NA) numerous CQ's blatantly pandering to specific recently-released units.


I already made my point re: availability and capacity for upgrades of old GBF units vs old FGO ones. Have fun waiting for Salter to become relevant again in 2022.
                    > Arash's battery is only 25%

[No, it's definitely not](https://imgur.com/a/KWbMwZ3). If you've never been around for an event with a 50% CE, then you can use Dragon Meridian, which is a 3* essence available in the FP gacha.

>Having sub-optimal units plays a comparatively small part (compared to summon and grid strength) when it comes to fast clears in GBF. Not having a very few very specific limited characters in FGO makes or breaks farming teams.

I'm not really sure how you can say this when 6 dragon raids practically live or die whether you have the right units. Have you tried doing Wadmus without any limited units? It's extraordinarily painful.

>Now I'm the one who has to question whether you've player FGO at this point. There have been in the past (and are yet to come in the future, at least to NA) numerous CQ's blatantly pandering to specific recently-released units.

That's really completely irrelevant to any points I was making. Never did I say there weren't top tier or pandered units in FGO.

>I already made my point re: availability and capacity for upgrades of old GBF units vs old FGO ones. Have fun waiting for Salter to become relevant again in 2022.

In FGO, you might be stuck with that Altera as your only SSR Saber for a year if you're only mildly unlucky; in GBF you can GUARANTEE getting a Grimnir or better yet an Andira within a few months.

>Also, putting aside the GBF vs FGO thing, the idea that you're "guaranteed" a 5* in any character is complete bollocks.

We know every 4* SSR in GBF will eventually get a fifth star, the question is simply how far in the future and how good it will be when it comes.


>So use a friend's. I also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary. I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

Using a friend's Waver is far more limiting than having your own, especially since most popular farming strats include having at least two meta supports (Waver/Waver, Waver/Merlin, then later Skadi/Skadi and even later on Castoria/Castoria). For harder quests, you're faced with the choice of either using a support Caster or actually picking the DPS you need for a particular fight if you don't happen to have it. FGO having no grids and no MC abilities beyond the intentionally limited scope of the Mystic Codes means you're that much more reliant on units for any setup, and that's a fact.

> also noticed you completely skipped over the part where there's just immeasurably less farm necessary. I'm pretty sure the amount of time I put in GWs totals to more time than I put into all FGO events in the entire year combined, and I don't have any of those units.

Because that has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a game is F2P or not. GBF is a much grindier game, no dispute there.


>There's a number of decent excellent f2p farming units like Arash and Spartacus. It's not "have these limited units or you have literally nothing."

And they're still irrelevant if you don't have a Kscope or at least an Imaginary Element. Even if you could make efficient 3-turn setups FOR THE MAJORITY OF CONTENT without any limited SSRs, the gacha also limits you in what Craft Essences you get, and potentially even worse since specific Craft Essences are never on rateup.
        >And they're still irrelevant if you don't have a Kscope or at least an Imaginary Element.

I'm honestly questioning whether you've played the game or not at this point. Arash and Spartacus are amazing *because* they don't require kaleidoscope. There are a TON of events that give you +50% NP gauge at the start. You can easily get them to 80% and them top them off with Waver while still giving 30% to whoever's switching in for Arash.

>Because that has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a game is F2P or not. GBF is a much grindier game, no dispute there.

It's 100% relevant.  Having poor units might cause an increase in your clear times by 100% for FGO but only 30% for GBF. That sounds really bad, but when you put actual numbers to it it's an increase of 3 hours to 6 hours for FGO but 15 to 20 hours in GBF. That makes a big difference. Time isn't infinite, and demanding more out of your players that don't cough up is inherently less f2p friendly.

>For harder quests, you're faced with the choice of either using a support Caster or actually picking the DPS you need for a particular fight if you don't happen to have it.

You don't need a specific DPS to clear FGO challenge fights. You don't even really need a specific support aside from the very challengiest of challenge fights. d

>Both are serviceable, both are ultimately bottom tier compared to most of their peers.

And yet the difference between bottom tier in FGO and GBF is leagues apart. Taking Heles into your challenge fights in GBF is just being a leech. Even Altera without interlude buffs would contribute significantly more.
            Arash's battery is only 25%. You need either a Kscope or a 50% event CE (which are in fact, rare and becoming rarer still in the future) and another battery to bring him to 100% in order to NP wave 1 (which is the only thing he's good for). Spartacus' is 50%, but his damage is also commensurately lower- very good for his rarity, but you couldn't use him, for example, to farm the recent Gilfest's mobs. 

Having sub-optimal units plays a comparatively small part (compared to summon and grid strength) when it comes to fast clears in GBF. Not having a very few very specific limited characters in FGO makes or breaks farming teams.

Now I'm the one who has to question whether you've player FGO at this point. There have been in the past (and are yet to come in the future, at least to NA) numerous CQ's blatantly pandering to specific recently-released units.


I already made my point re: availability and capacity for upgrades of old GBF units vs old FGO ones. Have fun waiting for Salter to become relevant again in 2022.
                > Arash's battery is only 25%

[No, it's definitely not](https://imgur.com/a/KWbMwZ3). If you've never been around for an event with a 50% CE, then you can use Dragon Meridian, which is a 3* essence available in the FP gacha.

>Having sub-optimal units plays a comparatively small part (compared to summon and grid strength) when it comes to fast clears in GBF. Not having a very few very specific limited characters in FGO makes or breaks farming teams.

I'm not really sure how you can say this when 6 dragon raids practically live or die whether you have the right units. Have you tried doing Wadmus without any limited units? It's extraordinarily painful.

>Now I'm the one who has to question whether you've player FGO at this point. There have been in the past (and are yet to come in the future, at least to NA) numerous CQ's blatantly pandering to specific recently-released units.

That's really completely irrelevant to any points I was making. Never did I say there weren't top tier or pandered units in FGO.

>I already made my point re: availability and capacity for upgrades of old GBF units vs old FGO ones. Have fun waiting for Salter to become relevant again in 2022.

As opposed to Heles or Chat who've been unviable for around 4 years despite various rebalances?

At the end of the day, a game that makes you compete against other players who can gain an advantage over you by spending money is most definitely less f2p than what's essentially a single player game with really shitty DLC practices.

Regardless of how generous Cygames is with all their properties, players willing to spend money have a definite advantage over those that don't.
Gotta sparkle them, gotta ring them to boost stats, gotta use the event gear that hopefully you kept from 3 months ago and didn't take break from, and a single bad RNG means you gotta go repair them, spend buckets, sparkle again GOD DAMN IM GLAD I QUIT THAT GAME
Jesus christ I forgot about sparkling 1-1, what a cancerous 7 year old mechanic
I mean... yeah, I like that GBF has many units you can get from event reruns or the sidestories, but I wouldn't call most of the free SSRs good. FGO has some decent welfares - Chloe, Kintoki, Shiki etc, but also some mediocre ones. GBF had... few. Very few.

Eternals/Arcanum are technically F2P so I guess they count and most of them are very good, but to fully upgrade them takes VERY long time to grind out.
    Arcarum (No 'N' in it :) ) is hard time gated yeah (though honestly so are the good FGO welfares if you missed the first run), but Eternals aren't really THAT hard to get.  Sure it takes some work, but having a few at 5* in under a year is definitely feasible.  I just got 5* Eahta and I've only been playing since the anniversary event.  And I stopped for a few months in the middle there.  I twenty boxed the last GW for Tien, and I'm going to finish it out in this next one.  If you want a real F2P grind, take a look at DBZ Dokkan Battle.  That shit is terrible.

There's also the fact that Granblue gives out a TON more free draws than FGO.  Throw in the sparking system, and you're basically guaranteed a couple of top tier units.  Then there's the fact that most of your strength in this game comes from your grid, which is almost entirely F2P.  Even if you have pretty crappy characters, you can continue to progress because a lot of your power comes from farming weapons.
        Yeah, 5* isn't as hard as it used to be, but I was mostly referring to the "final" upgrade that was released recently.

Granblue does give a lot more draws, but imagine if you didn't *need* those draws and could use your favorite SRs and succeed as you do with SSRs.

Nevermind that Granblue *does* have multiplayer element, meaning you not having SSRs does mean you will not contribute during Guild Wars as much as other people and during multiplayer fights you have smaller chances to get high enough score to get bonus chest...

>Then there's the fact that most of your strength in this game comes from your grid, which is almost entirely F2P.

Debatable. You CAN do F2P, but other than very grind-intense double Magna grids you still need an elemental summon, right? I think that hasn't changed since I stopped playing - few grids can handle double Magna as it is.
            >You CAN do F2P, but other than very grind-intense double Magna grids you still need an elemental summon, right? 

I think the part you're forgetting is the second summon is a support summon.  You absolutely don't need to own it yourself.  I certainly don't own a Lucifer, and my Bahamut is nowhere close to ULB.  It's like borrowing your buddy's Merlin/Skadi in FGO.  And it's preferable to have them as a support summon as well, because support summons can always be called turn 1, no matter what their cooldown is.

Also they just boosted the drop rate for M2.  They've also just started running drop rate events.  I've literally went from almost no M2 weapons to all full M2 grids in the past few weeks.
But some moreso than others. I've never felt like that in Azur Lane, for example- whatever its other failings, even as a F2P player you get way more characters to play around with than you can ever use, and the only thing to spend money on is dresses to make your girls look even prettier.  FGO might not nickel-and-dime you like some other games (looking at you, E7), but that's because it doesn't even care about giving good value to the people who DO whale. The gacha is cruel and that's just how they like it.
>This is really, really not true. You can 100% get a full set of useful characters to max level and their skills reasonably leveled within a month for GBF to complete challenge quests. Especially if you don't mind spending command seals. You definitely cannot be ready to fight Luci HL within even a couple months without serious no lifing.


I said "commensurate" time invested, not "same" time invested. Google that if you don't know what the word means.

>100% no. I don't think anyone reasonable would agree with this. Meta units coming out completely blow away units coming out the years previous. Using Saber Altera is in no way even remotely comparable to trying to use Carmelina.

Both are serviceable, both are ultimately bottom tier compared to most of their peers. Carmellina being comparatively worse than, say, Grimnir than Saber Altera is to Musashi is also made up by the fact that Carmelina (or any other SSR) is far easier to acquire in GBF than it would be in FGO.
