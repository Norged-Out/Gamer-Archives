[[The Golden Week Special campaign is back! It will last until May 8, 459 JST.]]


Most notably, this one features:

Daily 10-part Draw for 11 Days.

Skyscope Missions, whose rewards include 1 Eternity Sand and 1 Lapis Merit.

Arcarum Double Bash (number of daily Arcarum tickets doubled).

Of course, missing from this list is the elusive and coveted Arcarum Defender Gauge bonus, but you can't have everything in life.


150 niyon here i come!!!
Golden week always sneaks up on me.

Was surprised to see 10 pulls, feel like an old man that the two last years weren't enough to imprint this exciting new world full of hopes and dreams we live in now.

We've had two grands released in this period before, so there's always hope.
Free Lapis Merit is always nice
    I don't know about that, I hope we are still getting standard sunlight stone from tweet or something. I personally wouldn't give up a sunlight stone for lapis merit that wouldn't be useful to everyone.
        Since when did we get sunlight stones for golden week, usually it's just the usually daily 10 draw + magfest.
            We didn't get a scope mission before either, as far as I remember. Usually, a scope mission would have Sunlight Stone as the top prize, which, for people who have no urgent use for Lapis Merit (and that could be the majority of people), would be a lot better reward. But I could easily see them giving away the stone in a tweet, like they have been doing recently with campaigns.
                Uhhh... in my experience the top prize was generally a brick or a 10-draw ticket. I recall a couple Skyscopes that had a Sunlight stone as **a** prize, but I don't recall one in recent memory where it was the big one.
                    It was standard prize up until they introduce sands, you would have brick and stone.
                        Skyscope missions have never had "standard" prizes. It depends on the type of event (Summer, Winter, Collab, etc.) and it varies even between iterations of events. For example, Summer missions had a sunlight stone in 2021 and 2023, but not in 2022 (had sephira evolite instead).

I haven't meticulously checked, but I think brick and stone from skyscope mission was only done once, for Anniversary 2022.

                        I don't think you know what you're talking about. First you say Sunlight Stone was top prize for Skyscopes, now you're saying it was a standard prize. Inconsistency is a good sign of bumsmoke.
Happy for the sand. Agastia hasn't coughed one up in like 2 weeks and I'm 2 short of being able to 6* Colo and Celeste when they come out
Very happy for the lapis merit and the sand. Keep the guaranteed sands coming, we need a ton of those.
Will use those off gala draws on classic so it's nice
