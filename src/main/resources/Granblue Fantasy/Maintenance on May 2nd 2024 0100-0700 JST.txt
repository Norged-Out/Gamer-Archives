What's the update entails? Sorry I haven't been in the loop
    Magna 3 release for Colossus (Fire) and Celeste (Dark)

Umikin has a [summary of future updates](https://gbf.wiki/User:Umikin/Timeline) on the Wiki which is a handy reference!
        That's neat! Also I really hope colossus m3 is actually good, I've been stuck with aes grid for too long
            do you like the idea of fire guns
                tbh Fire does lack good guns for MH so yeah
                    smh shit talking Benedia for Soldier EX+ god tech

(honestly the only real good one is just Silva's Gun and only for Soldier yeah)
        Dark is going to a rough farm next week lol
It reminded me that my water burst sucks, damn, if only they didn't gutted y.anila's S3
Chances it will include the main story update?
    I'd say 50/50 based on the timeline.
