Every day
I think this every time I see them.

I saw that little character in a PeterSripol video and now I want to know if he plays LBP
i gatekeep the knowledge but still sad
Is this real?
As someone who knows it originally from lbp psp I can confirm that I take the original image and make it my profile
i love banana cat:) ‚ô°
    Why do you like this sacknana ripoffüò†üò†üò†
All hail our Lord and saveior sacknana
Kids nowadays don't even know what lbp PSP is they probably don't even know what lbp is they are to buissy playing poppy playtime and garden of banban
    You are literally a child
        That doesn't mean Im like any of the kids now a days the only kid things that I play are Minecraft fnaf and sometimes roblox and I'm extremely nistoglic for lbp since it was the first ever PlayStation game I ever played so yah my age doesn't matter
            Yes it does, you're complaining about kids playing poppy playtime when you have a fnaf profile picture. Both are awful mascot "horror" games but at least one of them has decent graphics and the other is FNAF
