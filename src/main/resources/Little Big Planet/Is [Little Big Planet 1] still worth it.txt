[[Is [Little Big Planet 1] still worth it]]


Or maybe jumping directly to 2 or 3?


2 is the best one in my opinion, but 1 has some awesome story levels.
You should be able to find LBP1 and 2 for fairly cheap nowadays, especially if you have a local second-hand games store. I prefer one and two over three any day, especially on PS3. (LBP3 is great on the PS4). The stories aren't tied together, so you're not missing any lore if you skip to three.

If you decide to play them all, go in order. Each game adds something new, and one will not have the same bells and whistles that three has, if that makes sense.

My opinion on the best game doesn't really matter, but overall people love two the most, I think. However, every game is an extremely fun, charming platformer and so I recommend them all! 

Have fun!


Edit: Someone pointed out, LBP3 is the only online LBP anymore (I keep forgetting that!) so definitely go for three if you want online play!
Of course in 2008 but sadly not anymore. Unless you just wanna play the charming story.
    lbp1 is timeless, same applies to 2 and even 3. sure there's a lack of content in the first game but that opens up more avenues for you to be creative. this take is wack tbh
        Highly agreed. I still play LBP1 to this day and it plays and performs better than LBP2 or 3 did, however all three games always have something worthwhile to offer despite any issues with the later games (LBP3 has a fantastic toolset and my favorite one in the series, but LBP1 and 2 are both great and shouldn't ever be passed up).

Nah just get 3(ps4 or ps5)… the servers are shut down
    Unless you want private servers. Lighthouse supports 1-3 private on ps3
        Why am I getting downvoted they are literally shut down
            Because there is still online play for emulation and hombrew. Also the games are still fun offline. Lbp1 has a good story mode with special edition content and so does lbp2.
                what is emulation and hombrew, im confused
                    Look it up. Emulation is a way to play games on nonintended devices and homebrew is a way to hack systems to legally rip games.
                        That sounds complicated
                cool but why
¨little big planet 2
Just get 3. It has all the content from 1 and 2. It's not worth it
    Thanks! I read that some people prefer the 2 over the 3, do you know something about that? BTW I play them on a PS3.
        I prefer two over three. Media Molecule did an amazing job with one and two (especially two!) and when they handed the LBP reigns over to Sumo Digital, it was quite a change. Sumo added a lot of stuff to three, way more than the other two games had, and I personally felt like it was rushed and disingenuous. The game also did not run well on my PS3, and performs much better on the PS4.

But I've been playing LBP since 2010, almost half my life, so my opinion is very biased. I probably spent hundreds, if not over a thousand hours on one and two.
            It's cool that lbp 3 ps4 still has online, but 2 days ago I was playing with a friend and the amount of times a level crashed, amount of times one of us got kicked from eachother pods and what not, is just atrocious, it makes me sad, that the servers are this bad now:(.
        Oh your on PS3. You won't be able to get the most out of the game cause the PS3 servers are down. The PS4 version of lbp3 is the only game that can still go online. Oh and the lbp community has this really stupid mindset that 1 and 2 are more definitive games due to lbp3 being kind of glitchey but it has the most content out of all the games so I don't know why people believe that.
            Lbp 3 was rushed so that meant some of the main aspects of the game were rushed too so that would make the game not touching its full potential to be the best game in the series. Nostalgia also plays a role at what someone considers to be good

It obviously doesn't have online play anymore, but it's worth playing through the story especially if you have friends for local multiplayer
