[[[OC] Pokémon Emerald! Me on my first day with the bike P]]





This really makes me want to dig up my GameBoy and play Emerald
    Emerald just captures something about adventure and exploration.
        To me, it is the quintessential Pokemon game When I think Pokemon, I think Emerald.
        I get the same feeling from Sinnoh and Unova. Them regions are so expansive and fun to explore
            I can't seem to like sinnoh. I find it to be a filler generation.
    I recently did that with Sapphire, just got to the Elite 4. I highly recommend it! Even swapped out the battery so the in-game clock works again.
        > Even swapped out the battery so the in-game clock works again.

I did that about 10 years back and it was something I’d never want to do again. It’s possible, just a massive pain in the butt. My Sapphire cartridge has tape on the inside holding the battery in place lol.
            I was so worried I would snap something while getting the old battery out lol
                I got the old battery out of my Ruby cartridge a long time ago, but I could never get it to recognize a new battery :(
            Same! That’s why I just bought a pocket emulator. Check out Anbernic
            If you learn how to solder, it makes the experience 1000x better not having to worry about your game falling apart.
        I need to do this too. It pains me to see that message every time I start the game
            It’s nerve wracking to be honest, especially getting the old battery out. Berry growing is worth it though.
    I tried make an offer for two Emarald listings on eBay for $100 (price was $150). 

They turned it down and asked for $140

._.
        If you're on Android you could always emulate Emerald. I use retroarch and never had any problems. My Gameboy died a couple years ago so it was my best option
            My Boy! Also works great. It also feels weirdly natural to play Pokemon on the phone. Probably it is always sort of turn based in a way.
            That's what I ended up doing!

I soft reset until I got a shiny Mudkip!
            Do you know if there are any emulators for an iPhone?
                I personally don't know of any anymore. Apple constantly takes down emulators so all the old ones are gone. Emulating is one of the main reasons why I have an Android.
                    Thanks for the info. I always hear stuff about emulators for android and never ios; think I might have to switch over soon.
        i got a pokémon emerald that was like ‘aftermarket’ i guess? not an original copy but made by a different company. anyway it was way cheaper and works great so it’s a viable option if you just want to play but i understand wanting a real cartridge. i regret selling mine at age 16
            I've considered an aftermarket copy but after having copies of Platinum freeze on me I figured it wasn't worth it for me.
        Honestly just use an emulator at that point. $150, screw that.
            Yep, totally agree
        That’s crazy, a few months ago they were still going for $100.
            Same thing happened to me with Extra Epic Yarn. Was $77 new and now it's like $120 or something ridiculous
    Me too!
    Go on then
This is so smart and done so well!! I especially love the jigglypuff and the sleeping slaking!
    Thanks :)

            Altaria is actually behind all those clouds
    This is so beautiful. Hoenn has always felt like the most homey region to me, and this just secures that feeling in my mind and heart forever.
        I love Hoenn so much man
            Same.
    [removed]
        :(

you could get a retro pie emulator like the anbernic ones and have emerald on an sd card.

cheaper than getting a new gba and game.

or if you have a 3ds you can emulate it on that.
            Idk if it's frowned upon to say on this sub but literally could download myboy on Android than just Google "Pokemon emerald ROM" and be done in 5 minutes. I'm sure it's the same on iphone.
                [deleted]
                    To be honest I play on myboy with fast forward set at 4x and I have absolutely no idea how I ever played the games at normal speed as a kid.
                        lmao that’s true. with emulators you can set retroarch to fast forward as well though.
                you’d have to jailbreak the iphone. there is an emulator on iphone i’ve seen before but it’s on google and you have to save it as a home page icon, it isn’t the best for me but some people have gotten it to work well. 

i just say actual hardware because it feels a lot better than touch screens.
        Its was my favorite game but i dont know if i could call it the peak just based on how big the changes to special attack vs physical attack in 4th gen where.

Emerald will always be my favorite though
Just a side note. The characters in these games were BUFF. Do you know how hard it is to cycle on level ground, carrying anything at all, VS a slight hill? 
Pokemon trainer quads appreciation post.
    Well they *did* travel an entire countryside, sometimes more. 

Good point though!
        A good trainer never skips cardio.
            Rule #1: Cardio
                r/UnexpectedZombieland
    And traveling around the world x)
    Can attest, I bike to work every day eith my gear in a back pack that weighs about 15 lbs and it took months for me to not have to jump off my bike when there was a slight incline. My bike ride is also only 30 minutes, these kids bike all day every day
    The humans in Pokémon world are all super powerful. This is why it’s okay for a ten year old to leave home and go on an adventure, they’re basically indestructible. This is also how Team Rocket survives being blown up, shocked, burnt, and sent flying and crashing into the ground from thousands of feet repeatedly and they’re all perfectly fine. Plus there’s was that time where they [calculated how strong Ash really is](https://cheezburger.com/8096005/clever-tumblr-user-calculates-the-exact-metric-of-ash-ketchums-mind-boggling-strength) and it’s terrifying. 

The whole reason Pokémon obey humans is because *they’re afraid of them*.

        You know what? That actually makes a *lot* of sense.
    little buff boys
        TODAY!
            I mean, you get that, right, Troll Boy? You get why it can't be you? Yeah, OK, see, it can't be him! It just can't be Troll Boy.
    Depends on your gear ratio which is why modern bikes meant for this stuff have shifting gears. With the right gear ratio riding up a hill isn't that insanely difficult.
        I guess I'm doing it wrong lol, I cycle to work and have a 170ft climb stretched over a few miles. It's hell, even at the low gear where I look silly pedaling. Mostly the slow speed / fast pedaling is when my bpm is the highest
            Slight inclines are the worst though. When you don't really feel like you're going up, it's just harder to get anywhere.
            I may be wrong but I’m pretty sure you’re supposed to use the gears to maintain ~90rpm on the pedals, pedaling super fast just wastes energy. Don’t be too concerned with your speed and just try to maintain 90rpm as you climb, changing gears as the incline varies to keep at that pedal rate
    Every day is leg day in Hoenn.
    After two months of cycling two miles to and from work, I can confirm. There was just an ever slight incline where you can’t even visually notice on the way in. I thought I was just tired and going home was a breeze.

After looking at super precise elevation maps, I found out there was a slight incline
    Well the children did some crazy shit, particularly Ash.

Makes me consider whether the people in the pokemon universe in canon just have significantly more strength that real people.
I'm starting to draw some Pokémon fan art in pixel art, so here is my first one :)  
I will create a wallpaper version for pc and mobile soon. 

Thanks for watching! =)

[www.twitter.com/1tzah](https://www.twitter.com/1tzah)[www.instagram.com/1tzah](https://www.instagram.com/1tzah)
    I just found this, I downloaded some of your other work for wallpapers but I don't remember where I downloaded it from.

Do you have a link I can download from?

Edit: Nvm, you can download from Twitter. I had no idea, wild
That is a beautiful scene, captures the original vision perfectly. Whenever I beat the game I would sit there and watch the whole credits scroll by on my tiny chewed up Gameboy Advanced SP.
    Thanks!
Please dear god put this on wallpaper engine
    Yes i will do a wallpaper version =)
        tysm <3
        Where can we find it when its done?
            www.twitter.com/1tzah
            www.twitter.com/1tzah
I grew up with emerald, I don't think another version will ever take its place as #1 for me
    Same man. I’m gonna go listen to little root town theme and reminisce now lol.
When you think about it, Pokemon trainers are more fit than professional athletes. They run and bike across whole regions without getting tired.
    Yeah that is insane x)
    And without needing sleep.
        Naah everyone knows they sleep and eat when you put your Gameboy away
OP I need 100 of these including Flygon on my desk by tomorrow. For real, amazing work.
    Thanks!
        >Thanks!

You're welcome!
Your pixel art is amazing. If you ever do commission work, let a guy know!!!
    Thanks Dm =)
That spheal must be ENORMOUS

This is stunning! Great stuff OP
    Thanks!
LOVE the pairing of Mudkip and Gardevoir, it's adorable how it looks like it is kneeling!  Slaking, as per usual :P

Really love the energy this has!
    Thanks!
This give me nostalgia. It's an odd feeling of sadness, regret, happiness and gratitude all at once
    Thanks =)
Omg so much nostalgia. Gen 3 will always be my comfort zone forever and that little Spheal is SO WHOLESOME I CANT
    xD
This is fantastic!! I love the Tropius!
    I can't believe no one else is talking about Tropius?! Most underrated Pokémon out there & looking epic in this!
[deleted]
    What happened with them?
This is incredible, I love it! My favorite generation by far. Amazing work, thanks for sharing!
    Thanks for watching! :)
This is a massive wave of nostalgia thank you!!!!
    Thanks to you :)
I wanna live there 🥺🥺🥺
    me too :(
There’s a sense of nostalgia and fresh air with this GIF. Amazing artwork!
    Thanks!
I love all the personality in this
    Thanks!
I just started playing Emerald for the very first time after having just finished FireRed and HeartGold for the first time.
    Great, have fun :)
u/savevideo

I absolutely adore this I’d love to have it as a wallpaper
    Yes i will do a wallpaper version :)
Hi
    hi
This is amazing. It really brought me there, back to the first time I played Emerald as a kid. I’m weirdly moved!
    Thanks! =)
Absolutely amazing. I almost cried watching it. Really takes me back to simpler times
    Thanks =)
How did you make this?
    With photoshop and a drawing tablet.
This is where Pokemon games peaked! My favourite generation! This brings the nostalgia bombs, it's so well done. I'd play it again but while moving, my roommate stole my GBA SP with my Emerald in it. :'(
    Damn, what kind of roommate did you have? x(
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tEelG9FjXM

this reminds me so much of the ending.

i played the remakes a few years ago, defintley my favorite pokemon generation
    Yes the ending was my inspiration.
The sneaky shiny Jigglypuff is a great addition. My favourite part is Tropius though.
    Thanks!
Anyone else stay in Route 102 until you find a Ralts?
Is she not tired she has been doing this for so long
An aside - Tropius is a dope mon. Honestly one of the coolest.
The Tropius makes me happy
Getting the bike in this unlocked so much more fun
Fuck I nearly cried when I saw this. I love you OP
    Thanks!
I see at least 8 lewdable characters here
This is so awesome, but wouldn't technically speaking the background would move slightly too to the left?
    Yes, but the loop would have to be very long, and due to gif size i can't make that.
        Ah I see
This is so awesome. Look forward to seeing more of your art!
    Thanks!
especially love the background, amazing job!
    Thanks!
Que hace slaking con jiglipuf? Mmmmm eso debe doler!
    xD
Emerald is the best.
This is so good
Absolutely beautiful!

Emerald was my first Pokemon game

Finishing it for the first time and seeing them cycling back
I got a sensational feeling just watching this
    Thanks!
Wow that’s so amazing
    Thanks!
YO THIS IS SO GOOD
I rarely post on reddit art but this makes me smile from the inside
    Thanks!
Aww the mudkip is so happy
    =)
I have a hard time describing what it is that makes Gen 3 really special for me. But seeing this brings a comforting presence
This is adorable, great work! I love spheals face
    Thanks!
This is bloody fantastic
    Thanks!
This is really beautiful
    Thanks!

Gardevoir used Mind Reader!

Mudkip's mind: *Dial tone*
    lol
This is absolutely fantastic!
Holy Wow! This is amazing!
The looping is PERFECT what the hell. OP this is beautiful!
    Thanks!
The little Spheal in the background! 🥰🥰🥰
Wow, this is incredible
Just hit me with a wave of nostalgia. Thank you!
That’s so awesome! Saw that you’ll be making a version for Wallpaper Engine, will you make one for phones as well? Also, consider crossposting to r/ImaginarySliceOfLife, they would love this :)
    Yes, I will do wallpaper ver. I want also phone version, but I don't know what resolution should  be for  phones .
I think emerald is still my favorite
Best Pokémon game ever made.
Too much water :/
That Tropius is high af staring at the bush.
this is so amazing!!! I love how vibrant the colors are
This is so beautiful. Hoenn has always felt like the most homey region to me, and this just secures that feeling in my mind and heart forever.
    Thanks!
My favorite gen :) it just makes me happy
I never knew I needed a Gardevoir headpatting a Mudkip, this is precious!
    lol thanks!
Amazing. If you added an Altaria to the background clouds it would be absolute perfection.
how is this an oc?
Take me back to these days.
What is this art style/aesthetic called? Bit-something?
    Pixel art.
I hear the little Mac punch out music
Emerald was my introduction to pokemon. I need to replay it...
Ugh god I miss those game boy color Pokémon games
Either there are a lot of Gardevoir petting Mudkip or you're in some sort of time loop buddy
    Gardevoir cloned herself to pet all the Mudkips.
Is it possible to make something with this art style, this amount of pixels, in 3D?
    Yes, but sounds like a lot of work. =S
Nostalgia overload
Lovely!!!
Dawn: The Angel of Death on the way to Mawville City.
Did you make this bro? It’s absolutely beautiful! Howd you do it? I’ve been meaning to learn some animation
    Yes, i use photoshop.
        Is photoshop a paid service?
This makes me happy
It's amazing ! And there is Tropius ! ❤️
    =)
Really love this, the only thing I think it is missing is some of the Pokemon should blink sometimes, mainly the spheal in the back.
    You are right, thanks for the feedback :)
I love Tropius, if it was actually good I'd probably use it on every team, but it's sooo bad
This game had such a good vibe
u/savevideobot
Third generation is such a vibe man.
OP thank you. I’m going down a really dark spiral today and this just gave me a chance to break the negative feedback loop. That’s enough Reddit for me today and thanks again
    Thanks! Have a great day :)
Hoenn is pretty
[removed]
    lol welcome back :)
        [removed]
            wow thanks! :)
I played since 1st gen but sapphire/ruby/emerald really made me feel like i was on an adventure. All the places, the new bike, the story was kinda cool, you could go underwater omg! I remember spending my whole summer compeltely lost in that game (i played sapphire bluegang rise up!)
Haven’t played this in ages! I love this!
Use me as a "Pokémon Emerald for virtual console Nintendo Switch" button.

Emerald is cemented in as my favorite video game ever. It's the perfect middle ground (with great respect to Yellow) with no Magma/Aqua decision making.

They have Yellow & Crystal version. Why not Emerald.
that hill, oof

my legs are dying just watching this XD
Do you have more pixel animations on Reddit?
    Yes, on my profile :)
        Nice, I think I saw one before.
This is so cool it brings good old memories
    Thanks!
        >Thanks!

You're welcome!
[deleted]
    Thanks!
I know this is weird, maybe controversial for some but....
I always had this dream. What if I make it to heaven? If I do, I'd love to ask God to basically let me be a pokemon trainer in a world full of pokemon. It just sounds so nice. 

Again sorry for the weirdness but yeah.
    Nothing weird =)
Gorgeous! I’ve always had a ton of admiration for people who can draw full-on pixel canvases.
    Thanks!
        >Thanks!

You're welcome!
That’s one big spheal
Man, when I first saw tropius years ago, I expected it to be huge. Was a massive let down when it was moderately sized in the anime
    I also imagined tropius very big when i played the game as a kid, so i did the size as i imagined back in the days.
Pure bliss
This is like a better version of the credits. Absolutely stunning!
    Thanks!
This is so beautiful! I really thought the Tropius was just some random tree at first, incredible, everything looks so smooth
    Thanks!
ORAS and Emerald was peak Pokémon
You’re really talented, and this is awesome. I would totally play this!
    Thanks!
This is my favorite game ever!! You did this so well 🤩
    Thanks!
I funking love pokemon pixels
I love this with all of my love
    Thanks!
Beautiful.
Oh now this, this is beautiful.
Emerald was the best
Third gen best gen
for real
Emerald will always be my favorite. It was probably the 4th pokemon game I played and I definitely spent the most time with it
Love the wingull
cuuuuuute. my first pokemon game
Spheal ❤️
Amazing piece! That brings back so many nostalgic memories. What I wouldn't give to be able to experience that generation of pokemon games for the first time again. Sapphire is my absolute favorite pokemon game still
    Thanks!
This is beautifully done. I love every part of it.
    Thanks!
        I love every part, but I really loved the tropius, Jigglypuff and Slowking.
Amazing memories of this game
I love this so much!  Thank you!
    Thanks for watching! :)
Wow I can hear the music

    Yes i thought about that  but i was a bit tired x(
I’m so happy there are talented people out there, presumably around my age, who can truly capture the love/nostalgia for some of these games/movies the way I could only dream of doing, be it Pokémon or anything really. Emerald version was the first Pokémon game I bought myself with my own money and the one I probably poured the most of my time into. This gif really is just 🤌🏼🔥
u/savevideobot
Absolutely love me some Hoenn content.
I love the opening to emerald. It’s sooooo good. It makes me cry watching it sometimes.
    same :,(
        That music 🥹
*omw to make my animals attack and maul other animals*
10/10, would be 11/10 with the bunny hops lol
    x)
I don’t care what anyone says emerald was the best Pokémon game, had it for the game boy advanced and I still do. It’s still the most fun I’ve had with a Christmas present to this day and I’m 22 now
This paired perfectly with [this.](https://open.spotify.com/track/0d2F9wcykuZ1QzDMcI0Mf0?si=gE668uLsTD6QlIcSJAfcYA&utm_source=copy-link)
I wanna be that Mudkip in the beginning… not for gardeviour reasons😉
Amazing
This is amazing! Love the detail you put into it and the flow.
    Thanks!

Stuff like this really makes me wish for a spin-off stardew valley style Pokémon game

Dream game would have a region to explore, gym badges and contests to enter, but the meat of the game is in the central town, and gym badges and contests would be completely optional. You’d be more likely to travel to a different town just to buy some equipment or crops. Maybe sell some lumber in a town where it makes more money than the one you start in.

I know it’s a lot to wish for, but I think a game with that kind of content and the pixel art style would genuinely be my favorite entry In the series
    Currenlty I'm creating my pixel art game, and a game like the one you mentioned is something  that i would like to do some day :P
        That’s really cool! Is there a page where I can follow progress on the game you’re working on? I love your artwork
            Thanks!

Emerald was my first pokemon game and such an experience. This brings back memories.
Ohh man this takes me back to when i first got the bike in gold and i zoomed around the city.
Oh if only i could find a legit cartridge that costs less than an arm and a leg.
Same. Missing good spawns 

Thought this was Pokémon go for a sec
Your momma must be proud.
This is so damn awesome!
    Thanks!

As someone who put 1000 hours or so into Emerald growing up, I absolutely love this. Thank you for sharing!

That loop is clean as fuck. Love the animation man

Beautiful graphics
Emerald was the best man!
Good times good times

Excellent work! 👍
    Thanks! =)
Pokemon Diamond/Pearl/Platnium are better than any other pokemon game for one reason.

Turtwig
As somebody who grew up with these games, for some reason this is making me beyond nostalgic. Thank you for making this, it’s really well done and feels like it captures the downtime how I remembered/ imagined it as a kid.
    Thanks! =)
I can just hear Route 119 theme playing here
This is my favorite generation. It is also the first I played.

    Thanks! =)
It's spelled May, not Me.
Can I share it on my Instagram?? I will give you the credit.
    No problem.
        Your IG account?

The one earlier gen game I never got the chance to play.
OH THIS IS SO CUTE!!!!!
    Thanks! =)
That was my first pokémon game! On gameboy advance 💚💚💚

What a burst of nostalgia; Thank you!
    Thanks!
LOVE it
That's so cool
Maaaannn, this makes me want to play the vanilla version of ruby now.😁
Dude this is epic
Cute
Cue bicycle track music~
They damn sure never skipped leg day
Beautiful art!

Awesome
High Definition Pixel Art looks so good. It's sad everything has to be 3D and realistic now
    Thanks!
I'd really like to erase my memories and experience these games all over again for the first time
You should do a Brendon version of this
Incredible artwork. I do feel as though its a bit hard to focus on the objects that arent wingull/mc though.
Beautiful spritework! 😁
Looks nice!

So chill
so goood omg the memories
This is incredible. Really wish I could make this a device background somehow.
    Thanks, I will do a wallpaper ver for pc and mobile.
        Awesome!
Hoenn>>>>anything else
Add altaria near the clouds!
Beautifully captures my nostalgia. <3
So many memories as a kid playing this game. Pokemon Emerald will always be my favorite.
Spheal, you okay buddy?
I love this
Noot Noot
Love it or hate it, gen 3 is my all time favorite generation of pokemon.
Actually the girl is the ruby and sapphire but still it is very beautiful this work you deserve everything good they tell you
Wow, amazing job!
It’s been so long since I’ve played the Hoenn games, and this made me realize how much I miss that little magical piece of my childhood.
You are SUPER talented
This is crazy. I'm at a loss for words.
The best Pokémon

Emerald just captures something about adventure and exploration.
    To me, it is the quintessential Pokemon game When I think Pokemon, I think Emerald.
    I get the same feeling from Sinnoh and Unova. Them regions are so expansive and fun to explore
        I can't seem to like sinnoh. I find it to be a filler generation.
I recently did that with Sapphire, just got to the Elite 4. I highly recommend it! Even swapped out the battery so the in-game clock works again.
    > Even swapped out the battery so the in-game clock works again.

I did that about 10 years back and it was something I’d never want to do again. It’s possible, just a massive pain in the butt. My Sapphire cartridge has tape on the inside holding the battery in place lol.
        I was so worried I would snap something while getting the old battery out lol
            I got the old battery out of my Ruby cartridge a long time ago, but I could never get it to recognize a new battery :(
        Same! That’s why I just bought a pocket emulator. Check out Anbernic
        If you learn how to solder, it makes the experience 1000x better not having to worry about your game falling apart.
    I need to do this too. It pains me to see that message every time I start the game
        It’s nerve wracking to be honest, especially getting the old battery out. Berry growing is worth it though.
I tried make an offer for two Emarald listings on eBay for $100 (price was $150). 

They turned it down and asked for $140

._.
    If you're on Android you could always emulate Emerald. I use retroarch and never had any problems. My Gameboy died a couple years ago so it was my best option
        My Boy! Also works great. It also feels weirdly natural to play Pokemon on the phone. Probably it is always sort of turn based in a way.
        That's what I ended up doing!

I soft reset until I got a shiny Mudkip!
        Do you know if there are any emulators for an iPhone?
            I personally don't know of any anymore. Apple constantly takes down emulators so all the old ones are gone. Emulating is one of the main reasons why I have an Android.
                Thanks for the info. I always hear stuff about emulators for android and never ios; think I might have to switch over soon.
    i got a pokémon emerald that was like ‘aftermarket’ i guess? not an original copy but made by a different company. anyway it was way cheaper and works great so it’s a viable option if you just want to play but i understand wanting a real cartridge. i regret selling mine at age 16
        I've considered an aftermarket copy but after having copies of Platinum freeze on me I figured it wasn't worth it for me.
    Honestly just use an emulator at that point. $150, screw that.
        Yep, totally agree
    That’s crazy, a few months ago they were still going for $100.
        Same thing happened to me with Extra Epic Yarn. Was $77 new and now it's like $120 or something ridiculous
Me too!
Go on then
Thanks :)

        Altaria is actually behind all those clouds
This is so beautiful. Hoenn has always felt like the most homey region to me, and this just secures that feeling in my mind and heart forever.
    I love Hoenn so much man
        Same.
[removed]
    :(

you could get a retro pie emulator like the anbernic ones and have emerald on an sd card.

cheaper than getting a new gba and game.

or if you have a 3ds you can emulate it on that.
        Idk if it's frowned upon to say on this sub but literally could download myboy on Android than just Google "Pokemon emerald ROM" and be done in 5 minutes. I'm sure it's the same on iphone.
            [deleted]
                To be honest I play on myboy with fast forward set at 4x and I have absolutely no idea how I ever played the games at normal speed as a kid.
                    lmao that’s true. with emulators you can set retroarch to fast forward as well though.
            you’d have to jailbreak the iphone. there is an emulator on iphone i’ve seen before but it’s on google and you have to save it as a home page icon, it isn’t the best for me but some people have gotten it to work well. 

i just say actual hardware because it feels a lot better than touch screens.
    Its was my favorite game but i dont know if i could call it the peak just based on how big the changes to special attack vs physical attack in 4th gen where.

Emerald will always be my favorite though
Well they *did* travel an entire countryside, sometimes more. 

Good point though!
    A good trainer never skips cardio.
        Rule #1: Cardio
            r/UnexpectedZombieland
And traveling around the world x)
Can attest, I bike to work every day eith my gear in a back pack that weighs about 15 lbs and it took months for me to not have to jump off my bike when there was a slight incline. My bike ride is also only 30 minutes, these kids bike all day every day
The humans in Pokémon world are all super powerful. This is why it’s okay for a ten year old to leave home and go on an adventure, they’re basically indestructible. This is also how Team Rocket survives being blown up, shocked, burnt, and sent flying and crashing into the ground from thousands of feet repeatedly and they’re all perfectly fine. Plus there’s was that time where they [calculated how strong Ash really is](https://cheezburger.com/8096005/clever-tumblr-user-calculates-the-exact-metric-of-ash-ketchums-mind-boggling-strength) and it’s terrifying. 

The whole reason Pokémon obey humans is because *they’re afraid of them*.

    You know what? That actually makes a *lot* of sense.
little buff boys
    TODAY!
        I mean, you get that, right, Troll Boy? You get why it can't be you? Yeah, OK, see, it can't be him! It just can't be Troll Boy.
Depends on your gear ratio which is why modern bikes meant for this stuff have shifting gears. With the right gear ratio riding up a hill isn't that insanely difficult.
    I guess I'm doing it wrong lol, I cycle to work and have a 170ft climb stretched over a few miles. It's hell, even at the low gear where I look silly pedaling. Mostly the slow speed / fast pedaling is when my bpm is the highest
        Slight inclines are the worst though. When you don't really feel like you're going up, it's just harder to get anywhere.
        I may be wrong but I’m pretty sure you’re supposed to use the gears to maintain ~90rpm on the pedals, pedaling super fast just wastes energy. Don’t be too concerned with your speed and just try to maintain 90rpm as you climb, changing gears as the incline varies to keep at that pedal rate
Every day is leg day in Hoenn.
After two months of cycling two miles to and from work, I can confirm. There was just an ever slight incline where you can’t even visually notice on the way in. I thought I was just tired and going home was a breeze.

After looking at super precise elevation maps, I found out there was a slight incline
Well the children did some crazy shit, particularly Ash.

Makes me consider whether the people in the pokemon universe in canon just have significantly more strength that real people.
I just found this, I downloaded some of your other work for wallpapers but I don't remember where I downloaded it from.

Do you have a link I can download from?

Edit: Nvm, you can download from Twitter. I had no idea, wild
Thanks!
Yes i will do a wallpaper version =)

Yeah that is insane x)
And without needing sleep.
