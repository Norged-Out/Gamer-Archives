[[They didn't give Rayquaza a black shiny just to look cool...]]


Shiny Rayquaza, it is one of the most iconic shinies in all of Pokémon gaming. It is beloved by many and is loved to this day. Shiny Mega Rayquaza makes it much better and Pokémon really loves this Legendary. I have a theory why Shiny Rayquaza is the way it is. They didn't choose its colors just to look cool. While black makes this shiny look cool, there is actually a meaning to this shiny.


Good theory as to the origin... But then why is shiny Groudon, the Ruby Pokemon, yellow/green and not a dark pink/purple-ish color?
    Ruby and sapphire are the same gem stone in different colors. Corundum. So its a bit of a semantics think as to what color family is a ruby or a saphire but there is in fact pink saphires and yellow/green rubies.
        Hell, Kyogre could have even been purple like a purple sapphire
    Cos whoever makes the shiny colours doesn't give 2 shits about these random theories and just picks a random colour. Just by dumb luck because there's 1000+ Pokémon sometimes it happens to support a theory
        I’m not sure when they stopped doing this but originally they didn’t even choose the shiny colours, they just did a colour pallet swap and whatever happened happened. That’s why shiny variants like Pikachu and Jigglypuff barely change, and it’s why certain evolutionary like Charmander don’t have a consistent shiny pattern.
            That was only in Gen 2
                Yeah I wasn’t sure when they stopped doing it so I made sure to use old examples
                Nope they did it until gen 6
                    This is not true

                Interesting. I learned something new today. Thank you!
        I think I've read that most shinies are auto-generated by some sort of formula that just modifies the Pokemon's current color palette to like, some sort of "opposite" palette. Only unique Pokemon like starters/legendaries etc. might be manually-colored.
            This is not true

                Read the replies bud, he even mentions that an algorithm might be picking the shiny colors. I didn't mean to refer to it as LITERALLY a palette swap, but that there is some sort of formula or algorithm used to determine shiny colors, this isn't debatable bud, it explains why so many blue Pokemon turn pink/purple.
                    If it were algorithmically generated from the colors of the base sprite, we would expect those changes to be consistent across all sprites with the same color, yet even those who share identical shades of yellow, per the provided example, end up with completely different colors as replacements. The only way an algorithm would do that, would be if the algorithm is based on something *other* than the colors of the base sprite, such as the dex# or some other value that is unique to a each specific pokemon.
                        It may be a semi-random algorithm. An opposite color is selected, and then, on top of it, it is shaded by some other value. This would be simmilar to how many games program firearm knockback: it is neither entirely random nor already predetermined, instead, it is somewhere in between; a weapon may have a "7" shaped pattern, and there is a minor, random spread over that pattern.
    Because people are reaching deep for anything Pokémon during this year long drought.
        Year-long drought? My friend, there should never be only a year between two releases of the same franchise. That's how low-quality or incomplete games get rushed.
        Is that a pun on Groudon's ablity?
        Fans of all media properties will do this kind of cutesy nonsense. It's fine to point out coincidence but everyone is so determined to seem clever they'll frame it as fact.
        I am incredibly grateful that we are getting a gap year. Not only will it make the new game higher quality hopefully but I’m honestly so behind on the games at this point and can’t even keep up.

I’d be happy to wait several years between releases if it meant better games tbh. Zelda, animal crossing, and Pikmin are all amazing franchises but they have to wait 5 years between major releases at least on the regular.
    Because shinies were not handcrafted prior to gen 6 (with a few exceptions i.e. Charizard). Rayquaza's shiny does not mean anything. It was just the colours that whatever algorithm they used spat out.
        This is not true

            I didn't say it was a palette swap. I said it was an algorithm. The Gen 2 algorithm has already been estimated, and that exact tweet you linked is mentioned within the first 2 minutes of the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAyDsVpwELM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAyDsVpwELM)
    Just cuz groudon doesn't follow the same pattern don't mean that it isn't true of rayquaza. With groudon it was probably more of how magma looks gold if it's really hot.
    Because shiny Kyogre was already pink.
Game freak has to be so happy when fans make up the lore for them.
Mega Shiny rayquaza Is sure BLACK.
They didn't choose the colors at all. Back before gen 6, all shiny pokemon were just pallet swaps, and they're always the same pallet. It's why so many ended up green.
    Outside charizard who got its shiny changed from purple to iconic black
        a few shinies were changed in gen 3 bc the base pokemons colors changed and so did the algorithm a bit but iirc charizards was specifically chosen
    with just a few exceptions
    That's been deconfirmed for years. Multiple Pokémon who had identical non-shiny colors had different colors for their shinies even back in Gen 2. I don't mean like "neither are pink" but like, the exact color is not the same even if the non-shiny colors are the exact same color code. Shinies have always been manually chosen. It's just possible we have so many blues turned pink and others turned green because of shinies still being a new concept in Gen 2, and possibly having only one or a few people decide shinies each generation.

If I recall, James Turner once said there's a guy that chooses shiny colors for Pokémon. If that's true, I can see it getting hard from time to time to pick a good color to change Pokémon to, especially back when color pallets were limited to 2 colors
        its based on a somewhat complex algorithm that factors in a pokemons index number, its type, and a few other things. thats why the colors dont always output identically
    pokemon fans love saying that, but there's no evidence that this is true, and there is contradictory evidence, like Natu and Xatu having identical color palettes before being shiny but different ones after being shiny.
        I think there’s a lockstin video where he explains how works
            i don't watch that youtube channel so i don't know what they purport but I'd wonder if they have any actual evidence, like an interview from game freak saying that they used to use an algorithm.
                
The video if I remember correctly he shows an algorithm generating the exact shines from the 2d games without any knowledge of the actual shiny colors, there’s more to it and it’s an interesting watch even if you don’t believe it but he basically shows that it could have been a pallet swap. Game freak hasn’t and will probably never disclose how they picked the shiny colors for the same reason as to why they don’t disclose beta Pokémon designs.
    Shiny Amoonguss looks like a Master Ball. Do you think that is not a delibrate choice?
        They’re not the exact purple of master balls. I love thinking this even though it is probably just coincidence.
            Amoongus is a lot more blue than purple for sure
        for a lot of shinies before gen 6, red gets swapped to blue. So it's just a coincidence. Also it's not master ball purple it's a dark blue/purple
            it's because they didn't do the shinies manually, they just used whatever color was next in the color palette. That's how we got things like regice's shiny.
                i dont think they just swapped to the next available color, they had an entire algorithm set up and "switch to the next palette" was just one of the possible options. A lot of the time one of the options is to switch to a color a set distance away on the color wheel which is why brown/tan pokemon tend to have green shinies. A lot of gen 1 pokemon are like this
        No it doesn’t. Like, at all.
    That's not actually true, at all. There are Pokemon in Gen 2 with the same base pallet but different shiny pallets.
    specifically brown/tan -> green
    Gen 5 was not decided via algorithm
    This is a myth.
        The only thing that's a myth is that it's done procedurally in-engine. All sprites are just natural pallet swaps.
            That’s not true, Pokémon even with the same colours do not have the same shinies.

                The first reply of that tweet literally states what u/TheSpaceCoresDad said. They're still palette swaps, just not chosen randomly by the system
                    Are we reading the same comments?

His first one literally says 'They didn't choose the colors at all'. He even says it is the same pallet.

How does that match the tweet showing they did choose the colours and it is not the same pallet? That couldn't be more opposed at all.
                        They didn't choose the colors. They chose a fitting palette instead, which is made up of multiple colors. They didn't hand-pick each individual color. 
                            That's still choosing colours. No one said anything about hand picking each individual one, choosing a palette is still choosing colours, even if they're in a set. No one's arguing for each shaded pixel.

And it's still wrong. They're not 'natural pallet swaps'. The 3 pokemon shown had the same colours, but drastically different shinies. What's 'natural pallet swap' supposed to mean, if not that? Same for 'all the same pallet'?

I feel you're being too generous with what [u/TheSpaceCoresDad](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheSpaceCoresDad/) said.
                                >And it's still wrong. They're not 'natural pallet swaps'. The 3 pokemon shown had the same colours, but drastically different shinies. What's 'natural pallet swap' supposed to mean, if not that? Same for 'all the same pallet'?

It was a rumor for a long time that pre-Gen6 shinies were selected through some automatic process that gives them a new color palette (eG blue palette -> pink palette). This is obviously not true, but it is true that the Pokémon were given a palette swap, just not an automated one. This is what the tweet you yourself linked was debunking, but its agreeing with what u/SpacecCoresDad said.

"Natural" is a weird way of phrasing it, "curated palette swap" would've been a more accurate way I think.

>No one said anything about hand picking each individual one, choosing a palette is still choosing colours, even if they're in a set

You're not talking about it, but this comment is based on that.

>I feel you're being too generous with what [](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheSpaceCoresDad/) said.

I think you're rather just missing the point. There's a big difference between "they picked the colors" and "they picked the palette"
                                    >This is what the tweet you yourself linked was debunking, but its agreeing with what SpacecCoresDad said.

I agree with that being debunked, and I understand there's no automatic process here, as said by SpaceCore (I feel rude if I keep mentioning him, might clog up his notifs?).

My issue is more with the 'choosing of colours' part.

>"Natural" is a weird way of phrasing it, "curated palette swap" would've been a more accurate way I think.

Thank you, I think that's clarified the detail for me. I had it wrong, where I was thinking 'natural' as in 'natural progression' like from yellow to green, rather than 'natural fit' for the design.

>You're not talking about it, but this comment is based on that.

Yeah, true, that's on me. Tbh, I actually forgot about the OG post here.

>I think you're rather just missing the point. There's a big difference between "they picked the colors" and "they picked the palette"

Is there though? What are you choosing the pallets for? The colours of the shiny pokemon. I feel it's a distinction without a difference in this example.

When they choose the pallet for Ampharos in that example, they still decided to make him mostly blue. That is a choice of colour, even if it is part of a pallet set.

If I choose patterned wallpaper that's 90% blue for a room, I've made the choice of colour for that room to be 90% blue, because I chose that pattern, right?

That's the same thought process for the pallets in my eyes. It's a simplification of the choice of colour, as opposed to handpicking each one, but it's still a choice of colour. Am I making sense?
        ain’t no way someone intentionally created those ugly green shiny sprites and thought ‘ah yes. perfect.’😭
            I mean, they did that a lot with SV, so I wouldn't put it past them...
great , now explain shiny gengar
    In Gen 2 Gengar was made up mostly of black pixels, and because the Gameboy color has limited color palletes, a shiny sprite had to replace the color originally used in memory with the new one. Because black was used for UI and to outline all pokemon, it wouldn't be possible to code a shiny for gengar that changed so drastically that the new colors couldn't blend with black.
        Plenty of shiny pokemon have changed since gen 2, though. Normal cyndaquil was reddish while the shiny was purple-ish, including the fire. Gengar and others could have been changed after more colors were introduced in gen 3.
            Also, Smeargle's tail changed between its shiny and normal form. I don't even remember which version is which now, I just wait for the sparkles to appear if it's a shiny lol
                Oh, yeah, they switched, didn’t they? The normal one is green now.
        I buy that for Gen 2. However, nothing stopped them for making grayish shiny Gengar (or even white Gengar as they did with the Mega) from Gen 3 onwards, as they did with many other Mons and their colours.
    Shiny mega gengar is tooth and regular shiny gengar is when don’t brush tooth for long time
They absolutely did not follow this logic when making shiny rayquaza… or any shiny. Maybe they pick the colors now but they didn’t do it during Gen 3. 
Weren’t the pre gen5 shinies determined by an algorithm?
It’s really not that deep bro. Before Gen 6, shinies were simply pallet swaps of their original colors. There are a few exceptions, but if I’m correct, Rayquaza isn’t one of them.
    This is not true

        “This is not true” 
*refuses to elaborate*.
*posts incorrect tweet*.

Watch the video the other person who responded to you sent. It explains exactly how shinies were created before Gen 6. Also I recommend not posting the exact same thing to multiple comments.
Pokémon fans coming up with theories for shiny colour origins only to find out the colours are automatically generated will never not be funny

You’re basing this theory off of the Home 3d model render, which is subject to weird lighting, as are all Home renders.

You’re ignoring the fact that literally every iteration of its sprite, and even the actual in game model appearances, have depicted it as a straight up dark grey color. Hell, some official art has depicted him as a very deep blue. But this is 100% just the weird lighting that the Home model renders are subject too

    Even if I used the pixel sprite, there is still bits of green
Shiny Rayqaza is more a greenish grey than a darker emerald green
Nah, this is just a clever reach.
Shiny colors weren't actually designed by the artists until like gen 6 so any cool shiny until then was a recolor or a happy accident
You're right, they didn't choose its colours to look cool, because they weren't chosen at all. From Gens 1 to 5, Shiny colours were determined by a computer algorithm, resulting in Shinies that either repeated the same colour change such as Ditto and Mew both turning blue and Heracross and Kyogre both turning pink, or ones that don't make sense like literally every Eeveelution. In Gen 6 they started designing Shinies themselves and it shows. Any cool looking Shinies before Gen 6 are purely coincidence.
Omg I hate people who use colour pickers on shaded models/artwork to prove a point.
This must be why fan-made black Shinies tend to look “off.” They just jump straight to that #000000 hex code.
Turn dark, become rich. Got it.
Interesting observation.
wasn't every shiny resulted by an algorithm till gen6 where the 3d models broke said algorithm
Isn't gyarados the most iconic shiny?
    I said "one of the most iconic shinies" not the number 1 most iconic shinies.
        Oh I read it wrong sorry
Very crystal sounds funny to me.
And they didn’t give it a black shiny for any reason at all because for a VAST majority of shinies before Gen 6 they left it up to a color switching program.
Game Freak here, yeah, sure we did.
Rayquaza is so cute
Funny you think GameFreak would put this much thought or effort into something 😂
Okay but then explain what the hell is going on with Groudon’s shiny. You could say it’s a reference to yellow corundum but it’s not really yellow or even gold, it’s a weird yellow-green that looks more like peridot.
Nah, shiny rayquaza is totally black. Just look at the pixel sprites
They just did black cuz it was cool
That's not exactly a Theory, that's a Fact.

Up until Gen 5, the developers didn't chose the colours of the Shinies, they were just randomly generated based on the number of their color on the Color Pallet that multiple programs have and reverse that number with something that i can't remember right now. That's why multiple Pokemon have bad colored Shinies and why many Water types have Pink Shinies, cuz they share the same Blue color.
It was only after Gen 6 that they actually started to choose the Colors of the Shinies to give them some meaning. Rayquaza just had the chance to be black.
Idk if this post is serious or not but this is untrue lol.
    This post isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's just a theory. This may not be 100% true.
        I see, thanks for clarifying !
            your welcome
I got a shiny Rayquaza from an event and it is my precious baby lol
The shiny primal Groudon and kyogre are the same as shiny rayquaza. Explain that
    Well, cause they are probably based on shiny Ray. Since primal reversion means they just got back to their original form years ago when they were at their prime. Back then, Base Ray was throwing hands with those two Primals.

Years went on, and those two Primal got weakened and became the form we know today while Ray was never Weakened. He just got stronger because he eats a random meteorite. 

So the two Primal shinies are blacks to reference the trios at their Prime.
I’m still annoyed that Emerald didn’t get a remaster like Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire 😩
    But the features from emerald were in oras, there really wasn’t a need since rayquaza got his time to shine in the post game where he takes you to space to fight aliens while going super saiyan
[deleted]
    You can hunt him in dyna adventures. He is not really rare
        Ok. Never played past gen 6. So that’s maybe why I had this info
    it’s also in hgss. being in ruby, sapphire, emerald, heart gold, and soul silver makes it not that rare tbh
    To add onto the already said list, you can play USUM for 1/~1300(*vs the 1/~4000, or the fact it was 1/~8000 pre gen 6*)shiny odds and all legendary/mythicals other than Manaphy and Phione, are obtainable and other than Necrozma, Sogalao, Lunala, permanent gift Megaerna, and story gift Poipole, are not shiny locked. 

So.. get yourself USUM and start shiny hunting literally all your favorite legends.
        Poipole is not shiny locked either. It's just the 3 "box" legends, and nebby/cosmog. Usum is the perfect rng shiny hunting experience.

Edit: and Zygarde for some reason
            Wait I thought the gift poipole was shiny locked, hence why it’s an event Pokemon…

Bruh thank god I didn’t accept it, so I can now shiny hunt it for that stunning black, white and yellow shiny.
                Yeah I rng'ed it shiny in Mega Ultrapolis in both playthroughs, now have the shiny poipole family 😜
Ruby and sapphire are the same gem stone in different colors. Corundum. So its a bit of a semantics think as to what color family is a ruby or a saphire but there is in fact pink saphires and yellow/green rubies.
    Hell, Kyogre could have even been purple like a purple sapphire
Cos whoever makes the shiny colours doesn't give 2 shits about these random theories and just picks a random colour. Just by dumb luck because there's 1000+ Pokémon sometimes it happens to support a theory

    for a lot of shinies before gen 6, red gets swapped to blue. So it's just a coincidence. Also it's not master ball purple it's a dark blue/purple
        it's because they didn't do the shinies manually, they just used whatever color was next in the color palette. That's how we got things like regice's shiny.
            i dont think they just swapped to the next available color, they had an entire algorithm set up and "switch to the next palette" was just one of the possible options. A lot of the time one of the options is to switch to a color a set distance away on the color wheel which is why brown/tan pokemon tend to have green shinies. A lot of gen 1 pokemon are like this
    No it doesn’t. Like, at all.
That's not actually true, at all. There are Pokemon in Gen 2 with the same base pallet but different shiny pallets.
specifically brown/tan -> green
Gen 5 was not decided via algorithm
This is a myth.
    The only thing that's a myth is that it's done procedurally in-engine. All sprites are just natural pallet swaps.
        That’s not true, Pokémon even with the same colours do not have the same shinies.

            The first reply of that tweet literally states what u/TheSpaceCoresDad said. They're still palette swaps, just not chosen randomly by the system
                Are we reading the same comments?

His first one literally says 'They didn't choose the colors at all'. He even says it is the same pallet.

How does that match the tweet showing they did choose the colours and it is not the same pallet? That couldn't be more opposed at all.
                    They didn't choose the colors. They chose a fitting palette instead, which is made up of multiple colors. They didn't hand-pick each individual color. 
                        That's still choosing colours. No one said anything about hand picking each individual one, choosing a palette is still choosing colours, even if they're in a set. No one's arguing for each shaded pixel.

And it's still wrong. They're not 'natural pallet swaps'. The 3 pokemon shown had the same colours, but drastically different shinies. What's 'natural pallet swap' supposed to mean, if not that? Same for 'all the same pallet'?

I feel you're being too generous with what [u/TheSpaceCoresDad](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheSpaceCoresDad/) said.

It was a rumor for a long time that pre-Gen6 shinies were selected through some automatic process that gives them a new color palette (eG blue palette -> pink palette). This is obviously not true, but it is true that the Pokémon were given a palette swap, just not an automated one. This is what the tweet you yourself linked was debunking, but its agreeing with what u/SpacecCoresDad said.

"Natural" is a weird way of phrasing it, "curated palette swap" would've been a more accurate way I think.

>No one said anything about hand picking each individual one, choosing a palette is still choosing colours, even if they're in a set

You're not talking about it, but this comment is based on that.

>I feel you're being too generous with what [](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheSpaceCoresDad/) said.

I think you're rather just missing the point. There's a big difference between "they picked the colors" and "they picked the palette"
                                >This is what the tweet you yourself linked was debunking, but its agreeing with what SpacecCoresDad said.

I agree with that being debunked, and I understand there's no automatic process here, as said by SpaceCore (I feel rude if I keep mentioning him, might clog up his notifs?).

My issue is more with the 'choosing of colours' part.

>"Natural" is a weird way of phrasing it, "curated palette swap" would've been a more accurate way I think.

Thank you, I think that's clarified the detail for me. I had it wrong, where I was thinking 'natural' as in 'natural progression' like from yellow to green, rather than 'natural fit' for the design.

>You're not talking about it, but this comment is based on that.

Yeah, true, that's on me. Tbh, I actually forgot about the OG post here.

>I think you're rather just missing the point. There's a big difference between "they picked the colors" and "they picked the palette"

Is there though? What are you choosing the pallets for? The colours of the shiny pokemon. I feel it's a distinction without a difference in this example.

When they choose the pallet for Ampharos in that example, they still decided to make him mostly blue. That is a choice of colour, even if it is part of a pallet set.

If I choose patterned wallpaper that's 90% blue for a room, I've made the choice of colour for that room to be 90% blue, because I chose that pattern, right?

That's the same thought process for the pallets in my eyes. It's a simplification of the choice of colour, as opposed to handpicking each one, but it's still a choice of colour. Am I making sense?
    ain’t no way someone intentionally created those ugly green shiny sprites and thought ‘ah yes. perfect.’😭
        I mean, they did that a lot with SV, so I wouldn't put it past them...
In Gen 2 Gengar was made up mostly of black pixels, and because the Gameboy color has limited color palletes, a shiny sprite had to replace the color originally used in memory with the new one. Because black was used for UI and to outline all pokemon, it wouldn't be possible to code a shiny for gengar that changed so drastically that the new colors couldn't blend with black.
    Plenty of shiny pokemon have changed since gen 2, though. Normal cyndaquil was reddish while the shiny was purple-ish, including the fire. Gengar and others could have been changed after more colors were introduced in gen 3.
        Also, Smeargle's tail changed between its shiny and normal form. I don't even remember which version is which now, I just wait for the sparkles to appear if it's a shiny lol
            Oh, yeah, they switched, didn’t they? The normal one is green now.
    I buy that for Gen 2. However, nothing stopped them for making grayish shiny Gengar (or even white Gengar as they did with the Mega) from Gen 3 onwards, as they did with many other Mons and their colours.
Shiny mega gengar is tooth and regular shiny gengar is when don’t brush tooth for long time

Even if I used the pixel sprite, there is still bits of green
I said "one of the most iconic shinies" not the number 1 most iconic shinies.
    Oh I read it wrong sorry
This post isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's just a theory. This may not be 100% true.
    I see, thanks for clarifying !
        your welcome
Well, cause they are probably based on shiny Ray. Since primal reversion means they just got back to their original form years ago when they were at their prime. Back then, Base Ray was throwing hands with those two Primals.

Years went on, and those two Primal got weakened and became the form we know today while Ray was never Weakened. He just got stronger because he eats a random meteorite. 

So the two Primal shinies are blacks to reference the trios at their Prime.
But the features from emerald were in oras, there really wasn’t a need since rayquaza got his time to shine in the post game where he takes you to space to fight aliens while going super saiyan
You can hunt him in dyna adventures. He is not really rare
    Ok. Never played past gen 6. So that’s maybe why I had this info
it’s also in hgss. being in ruby, sapphire, emerald, heart gold, and soul silver makes it not that rare tbh
To add onto the already said list, you can play USUM for 1/~1300(*vs the 1/~4000, or the fact it was 1/~8000 pre gen 6*)shiny odds and all legendary/mythicals other than Manaphy and Phione, are obtainable and other than Necrozma, Sogalao, Lunala, permanent gift Megaerna, and story gift Poipole, are not shiny locked. 

So.. get yourself USUM and start shiny hunting literally all your favorite legends.
    Poipole is not shiny locked either. It's just the 3 "box" legends, and nebby/cosmog. Usum is the perfect rng shiny hunting experience.

Edit: and Zygarde for some reason
        Wait I thought the gift poipole was shiny locked, hence why it’s an event Pokemon…

Bruh thank god I didn’t accept it, so I can now shiny hunt it for that stunning black, white and yellow shiny.
            Yeah I rng'ed it shiny in Mega Ultrapolis in both playthroughs, now have the shiny poipole family 😜
Hell, Kyogre could have even been purple like a purple sapphire
I’m not sure when they stopped doing this but originally they didn’t even choose the shiny colours, they just did a colour pallet swap and whatever happened happened. That’s why shiny variants like Pikachu and Jigglypuff barely change, and it’s why certain evolutionary like Charmander don’t have a consistent shiny pattern.
    That was only in Gen 2
        Yeah I wasn’t sure when they stopped doing it so I made sure to use old examples
        Nope they did it until gen 6
            This is not true

        Interesting. I learned something new today. Thank you!
I think I've read that most shinies are auto-generated by some sort of formula that just modifies the Pokemon's current color palette to like, some sort of "opposite" palette. Only unique Pokemon like starters/legendaries etc. might be manually-colored.
    This is not true

        Read the replies bud, he even mentions that an algorithm might be picking the shiny colors. I didn't mean to refer to it as LITERALLY a palette swap, but that there is some sort of formula or algorithm used to determine shiny colors, this isn't debatable bud, it explains why so many blue Pokemon turn pink/purple.
            If it were algorithmically generated from the colors of the base sprite, we would expect those changes to be consistent across all sprites with the same color, yet even those who share identical shades of yellow, per the provided example, end up with completely different colors as replacements. The only way an algorithm would do that, would be if the algorithm is based on something *other* than the colors of the base sprite, such as the dex# or some other value that is unique to a each specific pokemon.
                It may be a semi-random algorithm. An opposite color is selected, and then, on top of it, it is shaded by some other value. This would be simmilar to how many games program firearm knockback: it is neither entirely random nor already predetermined, instead, it is somewhere in between; a weapon may have a "7" shaped pattern, and there is a minor, random spread over that pattern.
Year-long drought? My friend, there should never be only a year between two releases of the same franchise. That's how low-quality or incomplete games get rushed.
Is that a pun on Groudon's ablity?
Fans of all media properties will do this kind of cutesy nonsense. It's fine to point out coincidence but everyone is so determined to seem clever they'll frame it as fact.
I am incredibly grateful that we are getting a gap year. Not only will it make the new game higher quality hopefully but I’m honestly so behind on the games at this point and can’t even keep up.

I’d be happy to wait several years between releases if it meant better games tbh. Zelda, animal crossing, and Pikmin are all amazing franchises but they have to wait 5 years between major releases at least on the regular.

    I didn't say it was a palette swap. I said it was an algorithm. The Gen 2 algorithm has already been estimated, and that exact tweet you linked is mentioned within the first 2 minutes of the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAyDsVpwELM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAyDsVpwELM)
a few shinies were changed in gen 3 bc the base pokemons colors changed and so did the algorithm a bit but iirc charizards was specifically chosen
its based on a somewhat complex algorithm that factors in a pokemons index number, its type, and a few other things. thats why the colors dont always output identically
I think there’s a lockstin video where he explains how works
    i don't watch that youtube channel so i don't know what they purport but I'd wonder if they have any actual evidence, like an interview from game freak saying that they used to use an algorithm.
        
The video if I remember correctly he shows an algorithm generating the exact shines from the 2d games without any knowledge of the actual shiny colors, there’s more to it and it’s an interesting watch even if you don’t believe it but he basically shows that it could have been a pallet swap. Game freak hasn’t and will probably never disclose how they picked the shiny colors for the same reason as to why they don’t disclose beta Pokémon designs.
They’re not the exact purple of master balls. I love thinking this even though it is probably just coincidence.

Bruh thank god I didn’t accept it, so I can now shiny hunt it for that stunning black, white and yellow shiny.
    Yeah I rng'ed it shiny in Mega Ultrapolis in both playthroughs, now have the shiny poipole family 😜
Yeah I wasn’t sure when they stopped doing it so I made sure to use old examples
Nope they did it until gen 6
    This is not true

Interesting. I learned something new today. Thank you!
Read the replies bud, he even mentions that an algorithm might be picking the shiny colors. I didn't mean to refer to it as LITERALLY a palette swap, but that there is some sort of formula or algorithm used to determine shiny colors, this isn't debatable bud, it explains why so many blue Pokemon turn pink/purple.
    If it were algorithmically generated from the colors of the base sprite, we would expect those changes to be consistent across all sprites with the same color, yet even those who share identical shades of yellow, per the provided example, end up with completely different colors as replacements. The only way an algorithm would do that, would be if the algorithm is based on something *other* than the colors of the base sprite, such as the dex# or some other value that is unique to a each specific pokemon.
        It may be a semi-random algorithm. An opposite color is selected, and then, on top of it, it is shaded by some other value. This would be simmilar to how many games program firearm knockback: it is neither entirely random nor already predetermined, instead, it is somewhere in between; a weapon may have a "7" shaped pattern, and there is a minor, random spread over that pattern.

The video if I remember correctly he shows an algorithm generating the exact shines from the 2d games without any knowledge of the actual shiny colors, there’s more to it and it’s an interesting watch even if you don’t believe it but he basically shows that it could have been a pallet swap. Game freak hasn’t and will probably never disclose how they picked the shiny colors for the same reason as to why they don’t disclose beta Pokémon designs.
i dont think they just swapped to the next available color, they had an entire algorithm set up and "switch to the next palette" was just one of the possible options. A lot of the time one of the options is to switch to a color a set distance away on the color wheel which is why brown/tan pokemon tend to have green shinies. A lot of gen 1 pokemon are like this
The first reply of that tweet literally states what u/TheSpaceCoresDad said. They're still palette swaps, just not chosen randomly by the system
    Are we reading the same comments?

His first one literally says 'They didn't choose the colors at all'. He even says it is the same pallet.

How does that match the tweet showing they did choose the colours and it is not the same pallet? That couldn't be more opposed at all.
        They didn't choose the colors. They chose a fitting palette instead, which is made up of multiple colors. They didn't hand-pick each individual color. 
            That's still choosing colours. No one said anything about hand picking each individual one, choosing a palette is still choosing colours, even if they're in a set. No one's arguing for each shaded pixel.

And it's still wrong. They're not 'natural pallet swaps'. The 3 pokemon shown had the same colours, but drastically different shinies. What's 'natural pallet swap' supposed to mean, if not that? Same for 'all the same pallet'?

I feel you're being too generous with what [u/TheSpaceCoresDad](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheSpaceCoresDad/) said.

It was a rumor for a long time that pre-Gen6 shinies were selected through some automatic process that gives them a new color palette (eG blue palette -> pink palette). This is obviously not true, but it is true that the Pokémon were given a palette swap, just not an automated one. This is what the tweet you yourself linked was debunking, but its agreeing with what u/SpacecCoresDad said.

"Natural" is a weird way of phrasing it, "curated palette swap" would've been a more accurate way I think.

>No one said anything about hand picking each individual one, choosing a palette is still choosing colours, even if they're in a set

You're not talking about it, but this comment is based on that.

>I feel you're being too generous with what [](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheSpaceCoresDad/) said.

I think you're rather just missing the point. There's a big difference between "they picked the colors" and "they picked the palette"
                    >This is what the tweet you yourself linked was debunking, but its agreeing with what SpacecCoresDad said.

I agree with that being debunked, and I understand there's no automatic process here, as said by SpaceCore (I feel rude if I keep mentioning him, might clog up his notifs?).

My issue is more with the 'choosing of colours' part.

>"Natural" is a weird way of phrasing it, "curated palette swap" would've been a more accurate way I think.

Thank you, I think that's clarified the detail for me. I had it wrong, where I was thinking 'natural' as in 'natural progression' like from yellow to green, rather than 'natural fit' for the design.

>You're not talking about it, but this comment is based on that.

Yeah, true, that's on me. Tbh, I actually forgot about the OG post here.

>I think you're rather just missing the point. There's a big difference between "they picked the colors" and "they picked the palette"

Is there though? What are you choosing the pallets for? The colours of the shiny pokemon. I feel it's a distinction without a difference in this example.

When they choose the pallet for Ampharos in that example, they still decided to make him mostly blue. That is a choice of colour, even if it is part of a pallet set.

If I choose patterned wallpaper that's 90% blue for a room, I've made the choice of colour for that room to be 90% blue, because I chose that pattern, right?

That's the same thought process for the pallets in my eyes. It's a simplification of the choice of colour, as opposed to handpicking each one, but it's still a choice of colour. Am I making sense?
Oh, yeah, they switched, didn’t they? The normal one is green now.
Yeah I rng'ed it shiny in Mega Ultrapolis in both playthroughs, now have the shiny poipole family 😜
