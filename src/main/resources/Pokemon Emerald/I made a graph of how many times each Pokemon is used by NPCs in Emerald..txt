[[I made a graph of how many times each Pokemon is used by NPCs in Emerald.]]





And the most commonly used Pokemon in generation 3 is...

A generation 2 Pokemon.
    As someone who was very young when I got my first console, I got yellow, then I got emerald (skipping gen 2), so cue my surprise when I learnt maril *wasn't* a gen 3 Pokémon, in fact there are a lot of gen 2 Pokémon I still mistake for gen 3 like slugma, skarmory, corsola, and phampy (that last one is thanks to ash in the anime).
        Wait you’re telling me that slugma and skarmory are gen 2 o.O. How many more lies have I been told by the council?
            Skarmory was one of my core team in GSC, always made sure to get him as soon as I reached Blackthorn.

I had no idea Slugma/Magcargo were introduced in Gen 2. Apparently they were rare and only appeared on the Kanto Cycling Road!
                That was always one of my main grievances with Gen 2/the remakes, that loads of the cool Johto Pokémon couldn't be caught in Johto!
                    Exactly! I hated that houndour couldn’t be encountered until way late into the Kanto postgame. A fire dark hell hound? Cmon, who doesn’t want that on their team?
                        Gen 2 and 4 made the mistake of making the new pokémon really hard to catch.
                            I vividly remember the Alola games having a similar issue too.
                        Yeah. They introduced a new type then only made one Pokemon of that type (Umbreon) available before postgame.

Whereas every Steel type was conceivably available before the E4 (aside from Skarmory being version exclusive).
                            I think you could get Tyranitar before E4 too.
                                And sneasel
                                Only in the remakes yeah.
                                    Nope, never played the remakes.
                            And Murkrow? Or is it only available in the remakes?
                            And Murkrow? Or is it only available in the remakes?
                                Yeah sorry I meant in the OGs
                                    Oh ok, I've only played HG where you can find Murkrows in the safari zone. They should have put some Houndours there too, now that I think about it.
                        Why i hate gen 2
                            I hear you, but I can’t say I hate gen2 for that. 

It’s probably all nostalgia at this point but young me going from yellow with its mono coloring to silver with all the colors and new Pokémon? It just felt so different and special and magical for me. Nothing will beat me discovering chinchou and being amazed at an electric/water type. And the mysticism of the roaming legendary beasts? Man, I loved that stuff as a kid 

It’s definitely flawed, I’ve seen that on replays (which is why I think that the remakes are some of the best Pokémon games made since there’s so much improvement on those flaws) but I just still look back so fondly on gen2
                                Pokemon Gold was my first Pokemon game and I still will say gen 2 is thrash.
                                Even the remakes are mediocre, since unless you have trades or randomizers (which most people don't) you are stuck with gen 1 and 2 Pokémon
                        I was more annoyed that it wasn't still there in FRLG. I'd been hoping to use one against Sabrina.
                    You didn’t miss much with Magcargo. Trust me.
                        What?! You aint doing my exotic lunch item that way. Its a tonky fire type that learns some decent stab pretty early. It doesnt hold up well in competitive, but it is not bad in-game. (Or at least thats what i remember from my hgss nuzlocke lol)
                            Magcargo is one of the most flawed Pokemon in history. As the proud owner of the shiny KJ Hamler Magcargo, it makes me sad, but such is the reality.

-	4x weakness to Ground
-	4x weakness to Water
-	weakness to Rock, and by extension, a Stealth Rock weakness
-	Ridiculously slow
-	Terrible attack stat
-	Mediocre special attack
-	Mediocre special bulk
-	Lacking Rock STAB options
-	Weak Explosion
-	Lacking options to power itself up
                                Good incubator tho. I had one in Emerald.
                    Same it’s so lame.
                    It does totally suck, but it's mainly because the Gen II Pokemon weren't supposed to be "Johto Pokemon" so much as simply "newly discovered Pokemon". The problem is that by Gen III, they realized it wasn't realistic or logical for 100+ Pokemon to be "newly discovered" in every single game, so they changed the narrative to instead be that the "new Pokemon" hadn't been around before because they were native to the new region(s) — which left Johto in an awkward spot in retrospect.
                On that note, can we talk about how rubbish it is that there were Gen 2 Pokemon that only appeared in Kanto?
                    Or Sneasel that wasn't available until My. Silver. Before HGSS, you couldn't get Larvitar until then either, but as of HGSS you can get Larvitar as early as the 6th gym I believe, with the safari zone
                        You can get Sneasel on Ice Path at night on Crystal but it's extremely rare
                            And you can bet your butt my dumb self sat in that area until I found one too after learning that tidbit. For a frost weasel/wolverine demon thing? Heck yeah!
                                They really did Sneasel dirty with that typing pre-gen 4 though... my guy is barely usable until the split
                                I did the same thing but it took me way too much time to understand that it only appears on the bottom floor. 9 year old me lost endless hours of pointless searching on the top floor just to meet Swinubs and Golbats.
                        Before the 5th gym, if you go out of your way for it, I believe.
                    Yeah honestly it’s the reason why I can’t ever say Gen 2 is my favorite. The Pokémon distribution is terrible.
                        The post game was fantastic though. Felt like a whole new adventure. Wish all Pokémon games had a postgame like that
                            I hope the new generations will take the dlc (or have a better one in the main game) route and have great post game stuff
                    Gen 2 suuuuucked
                        I feel it's a bit harsh to say it sucked, considering how many improvements it made over the original games, but not every shot it took landed, that's for sure.
                            It didn't improve the original. It had color and fixed some bugs. But the Pokémon and most mechanics introduced were awful
                                Let's go over a few things you missed

* Added two new types, which helped balance the type chart which was heavily skewed in favor of some types, notably Psychic.

* Split the special stat, making it less abusable than it was in Gen 1

* Held items, which was such a huge game changer that there are Pokemon in today's current meta who couldn't function at all without that addition.

* Added a clock system with different encounters, both with Pokemon and as in-game events, at different times depending on when you did them.

* Breeding, the thing that lets you get a Pokemon with better or even perfect IVs without having to catch hundreds of the same species.

* Shiny forms, just as a fun little trophy to say "I made an effort to seek out this Pokemon and got a reward."

* Improved graphics, which goes far beyond just "having color" as you said. There was more detail, more variety in sprites, and Crystal even gave us animated Pokemon.

* Rebattling trainers, something which was previously limited to the Pokemon League. You could even rematch gym leaders, which was impossible before.

* Trainers actually had names instead of just a title

* Apricorns

* The Pokegear

I could go on, if you like.
                                    2 new types that were awful in gen 2
Held items that were all awful in gen 2
Clock system that is completely pointless in gen 2
Breeding, which is completely pointless in gen 2 due to lack of natures
Shinier that have less than a 1 in 8000 chance of showing up
Imporved graphics that do not hold up at all
Rebattling trainers was done infinitely better with the vs seeker as you could actually use it instead of waiting for a call
Pokegear which was a useless gimmick
Apricots that you could only get once a day
Want me to keep going?
                                Gen 2 is basically just everything they couldn’t fit into Gen 1, and it kinda shows.
                                    Yeah..... that game doesn't hold up. At all
                        You sucked. Johto is the **best**, fite me!
                            Sure. Why are most johto Pokémon unattainable? All the good one require trade, transfer, or access to the post game.
                    My gripe is that one tiny patch of grass in route 35 with a 1 percent chance of yanma. I’ve been keeping count on a play through and I’m at 167 encounters without seeing one, wounded
                Haha yeah. There's an NPC that tells you about slugma being there.
                I love skarmory but i miss its old idle stance. In pokemon stadium and the sprite based games it looked great. Post XY it's "airplane" stance looks so terrible to the point its almost comedy.
                Which makes them kanto Pokémon
                Houndour wasn’t until the cycling road in gen 2 either. Like wtf houndour is definitely not found only in Kanto
                This is the problem I have with Gen 2. Why introduce new Pokémon only to lock them behind postgame? 

Another issue I have is that most of the gym leaders are using Gen 1 Pokémon! As their aces too. Why the fuck couldn’t Morty use the only representative of the type from that generation on his team?
                    I think it’s because gold and silver weren’t designed to be “the next generation” of Pokémon games, they were designed to be THE definitive final pokemon games. A ton of the decisions/flaws make more sense when you consider that the series was never supposed to go beyond crystal.
                        Okay I see your point, but why couldn’t they rectify this in HGSS at the very least?
            In fairness, Skarmory was Silver exclusive, so it's possible you missed it entirely.
            Yup! I have to do a double take every time I think about what gen they are from, I've always felt like gen 2 is kind of like a weird "dlc" of gen 1, like it doesn't quite fit as a standalone, and takes aspects that would have been part of kanto and hoenn and mashes them together in the middle.
                As a trainer that got started in Johto I strongly disagree with you, but as someone that skipped two and played 1 & 3, I can see how you got there.
                no way, the second generation added so much; held items, a completely new region with like 100+ new pokemon, new evolution lines for kanto pokemon, berry crafting, tons of the different ball types, the sp def stat (no longer based off sp like in gen 1), breeding, several awesome legendaries and dungeons, and even added kanto as a part of it. 


Silver and Gold (and Crytal but never played that one) were probably the biggest jump in content from one gen to the next in terms of touching **everything**, definitely the one that had the most intros of core features (breeding and held items are a **huge** part of the meta).
                    The first 4 gens all had pretty significant jumps, it was only after Sinnoh that things kind of slowed down.
                        Well, Black and White introduced Hidden Abilities which really helped certain Pokemon a lot by giving them new uses in battle. X and Y gave us Fairy-types. After *that* yeah, things slowed down.
                    Don't forget two new, important types!
                    Of those, only the special split and held items really seem like things that wouldn't be slotted in DLC. Even new types feel like it'd be something you could add in DLC for a series with only 1 game.

Heck, of the 100 (why did you say 100+, there were literally 99+celebi?), many of them were already conceptualized for gen 1 but didn't make the initial cut.
                        breeding is completely novel, introduced eggs and baby pokemon. Those are gigantic DLC asks imo
                            Yeah but it's not something unheard of. I guess it's more an expansion than a conventional DLC, but yeah, adding mechanics of that size isn't that unheard of in an expansion.
                To be fair it kinda was. A lot of the 100 were planned pokemon for gen 1 that they didn't have time/space to slot into the OG game.
            For real! Blows my mind lol
            Lol I'm also shocked. I really believed they were gen 3
            I confuse those 2 for gen 3 pokemon too! I wonder if they're just that more common?
                A lot of Gen 2 Pokemon were really hard to find - Skarmory for example is very rare in one location in one game in Gen 2.  A bunch of cool Gen 2 Pokemon like Slugma, Houndour, Misdreavus, Murkrow, etc. weren't available to be caught until the post-game while being relatively accessible in Gen 3.
            Corsola is also gen 2
            Oh shit I had pokemon gold... Apparently it was only natural in Silver and Emerald. But then I also had 245 pokemon in Gold (until a little prick wiped my fucking save the piece of shit). I always assumed Skarmory was gen 3... I used to catch him up on that ashy volcano area where you collect soot for pokeflutes.
            In fairness, while Slugma was Gen 2, it was also only in Kanto, and if I recall, was only on the cycle path (routes 16, 17, 18). Probably easy to miss.
            SkarmBliss was even one of the most dominant forces in the gen 2 metagame if I'm not very mistaken.
            If you plaued Gold you would never see a Skarmory since no trainers use it and its version exclusive.
            Holy crap the Slugma bomb literally blew my mind lol
        Corsola has a big part in the lore of a town, and overall fits Gen 3 much more. I dont even remember where you get Corsola in Gen 2. Slugma also fits Gen 3 much better, since a volcano is more prominent in Gen 3, as well as Team Magma being a thing. Slugma seems like an afterthought in GSC.
            Apparently it can be caught using the good rod in the exact same place you get it (Olivine City). I'll admit though, I don't remember Corsola in gen 2 myself. Maybe it's another one of those Pokemon that NPC's don't really use.
            Id add chinchou to the list since we go visit underwater locations in RSE.

OTOH tho RSE is more focused on the environment and nature, whereas GSC is the conflict between traditions and modernism (where Kanto is the modern region and Johto more traditional). So I guess it makes sense, but ut doesn't ignore that Johto has the worst distribution of new pokemon of every region. And I feel like every route has the same wild pokemon whereas RSE and DPP it was always unique
        Wait, Slugma isn't gen 3... wut
            This one always blows my mind as well. There's a cave you can find it in post-Johto.
                Yeah weirdly Slugma and Houndour are found in Kanto.
                    And murkrow, and larvitar, and misdreavus, and half of the trade evolution items
                        Johto is the region with the least amount of Johto pokémon.
                        In HGSS you can get Larvitar pretty early via the Safari Zone. I used Tyranitar on my last playthrough
                            HGSS fixes a lot of tye distribution problems between the safari, walker, and other features. I also feel as though Cliff Cave and the safari helped fix the leveling too. Like just a bit more for people to do before the late Johto game.

Misdreavus and murkrow are available thru the safari or cliff cave too. I used misdreavus-> msimagius on both my HG and SS runs. 

Not a distribution problem, but Extrasensory on the egg Togepi makes Togetic much more viable as a pokemon. Maybe makes Morty and Chuck too easy but was a very welcome change
        Yeah I used to think Togepi was a gen 1 Pokémon because of the show.
            Kinda was, Togepi, Ho-oh, Marill and a few others were cut from R/B due to tech limitiations
        Forgetting Slugma is forgivable. You can’t even get it until late into postgame and it isn’t great. Houndour at least has a really cool design and was a fancy new Dark-type
        I actually though Medicham was a Gen IV Pokemon because it was so common in Sinnoh
        TIL Slugma is Gen 2.
        it was the reverse for me. as a kid i was absolutely positive volbeat and illumise were gen 2
            Cause of Camp Pikachu? It was a Gen 2 movie.
        Hell I just learned that chimecho isn't gen 4
            Well I can’t blame you, it’s chingling that’s gen 4 right?
                Okay, that’s one I actually didn’t know. 

So... why did Gen 4 decide Chimecho needed a pre-evo?
                    Gen 4 gave us multiple pre evolutions for pretty much no reason. Chingling, Happiny, Bonsly, Munchlax, and Mantyke.

Some other Pokémon that needed evos pretty desperately got them too, at least.
        i always thought slugma was gen 3 too
        I always thought macargo, slugma, and skarmory were gen 3 too.
        Those were all pretty hard to obtain in GSC as well. I like to believe that Pokémon like Slugma are actually native to Hoenn and only migrated to Kanto a few years after RBY.
        My first pokemon game was colloseum (weird i know)  so all gen 2&3 pokemon are the same gen to me
        CORSOLA AND PHANPHY ARE GEN 2!?
        Corsola blew my mind as a kid when i found out they were gen 2 and skarmory
        I had no idea slugma and skarmory were gen 2 Pokémon
        Same but leaf green to ruby, I still have to remind myself about Skarmory being gen 2 occasionally.
        A lot of people think Skarmory is Gen 3. I know it was gen 2 because of the anime but I don't remember ever seeing the Pokemon in the game.
        Same. FR was my first fame then I jumped into Emerald. I was so confused at how many gen 3 pokes were actually gen 2
        Skarmory always felt like a gen 3 pokemon, just something about its design just shouted Hoenn.
        As someone who played gen 4 first, I was sure all the pokemon I found were introduced in that gen. I was very surprised to learn that common things like Tentacool, Ponyta and Psyduck were actually older than me when I got the national dex.
    I have a headcanon thet Roselia was imported from Sinnoh and there's a Roselia trend going on in Hoenn which is why a lot of trainers use then but they aren't found in the wild (in emerald)
        I do think that some of the Kanto and Hoenn pokemon are from Sinnoh. But my headcanon was Snorlax not Roselia-thats why we see 2 snorlax in Kanto but Mumchlax are all over Sinnoh.
    No wonder IGN gave it "too much water/10."
    It's also absolute dogshit for base EXP yield (58 exp). The next most used Pokemon in Emerald, Roselia, has a base EXP yield of 152.
    Tbf azurill was introduced in this generation I believe, and marill is just its next stage.
    Genuinely surprised it wasn't a Gen I one.
        Gen III did have FR/LG as enhanced remakes of Gen I.
    Hey, don’t knock it if it works
    It has a gen III prevolution, so that's semething.
    I guess that explains why Marill feels so much like a Gen 3 Pokemon
    It bothers me that Marill is at the top when Corphish is only used once by an NPC, I’ve always loved it and wished it was more common as an early game water type.
Poochyena is much less than I thought it would be
    I instantly expected it to top the chart. Like, every single grunt seems to be using it. Then again some use mightyena later into the game so the number makes sense, add to the fact that few use them outside of the grunts.
        True, but I believe the grunt “model” that does appear frequently in game only counts for one in this chart.
            Each unique grunt trainer is accounted for. I think Poochyena feels more common because it's in so many required battles.
    Poochyena and Mightyena do account for 50 trainer Pokémon, mostly in required battles, so they're very present.
Interesting to see, kind of curious of which Hoenn dex mons are not there, because iirc the Sinnoh games are the only games where you can see every Pokémon in the region by just battling every trainer
    Did I not see Shedinja?
        Right, no one used that thing, presumably because someone might not be able to battle it
            Imagine Phoebe using one and ending your run with it
                [deleted]
                    So what is the deal, can this pokemon be killed by super effective moves or is it only damaged by critical hits?
                        Super effective moves only.
                        Only by supereffective moves. Since it's bug/ghost, it can only be damaged by flying, rock, ghost, fire, or dark attacks, and since it's set at exactly 1 HP, any of the above is an automatic one-hit KO.
                        Weather as well
                            And status effects like poison
                        Super-effective moves only, but it also takes damage from stuff like hazards, weather, status, so it's a lot worse than it actually looks.
                            Would be really cool but I assumed flying, ghost, and fire moves are pretty common in competitive play right? Seems like a pokemon that has a really cool concept but not fully executed
                                I think giving it so many weaknesses was probably for balance purposes

It's exceptionally hard to balance a Pokemon like that
                In Colosseum this can happen to you.  On Mt. Battle, battle 99 has a Shedinja and can completely wall you right before the end.
                    On the one hand, that's evil and I love it.

On the other hand, if you got up to level 99 on Mt. Battle, you probably have *something* to hit a Bug/Ghost type for super effective damage, or failing that, something with Will-o-Wisp/Toxic/Sand Stream/etc.
                        Mt. Battle is not difficult, just time consuming. You don't need status moves to get through it. I completed it with my kid strategy of only attack moves on all Pokémon. And unlike things like Battle Tower, legendaries are allowed on Mt. Battle.

So yeah, with that kid strategy, there's a big possibility to hit fight 99 and have no counter to Shedinja.
        There aren't even any fully evolved starters as the rival still uses Grovyle/Combusken/Marshtomb in the final battle against them.
            When I was a kid I always found it odd that you basically intimidate your best friend into retirement from battling at the age of 10.
                I think this happens to Hop too pretty much.  Or you bully him into no longer trying to be the best.
                    Perhaps he shouldn’t suck so hard then, at least hau put up a bit of a fight with that fucking riachu of his
                        The last strong rival was Blue.
                            Barry is actually pretty strong, silver is no joke either
                        Regular SM Hau with his Komala was pretty sucky, but **Ultra** SM Hau with Noivern/Tauros was a lot more of a contender.
                    He still battles (and if you have Shield, his final fight where he has Zacian is a pain in the ass) but he stops obsessing over becoming champion.
            Iirc they were even above the level they would need to be at to evolve? Might be misremembering tho.
        Yeah, Nincada at 5. Ninjask at 12.

Shedinja at no.
        I could be misremembering but I believe you can find a single trainer with Shedinja on the route after Meteor Falls (between Meteor Falls and the first gym city). I believe you need surf so if I'm right it makes sense that many people didn't come across it.

Edit : Never mind I am apparently misremembering it with Ninjask. Either that or I met one in a randomizer there (looked up on Serebii's PokeEarth).
    Had a look through the list of 0 used and for regional Hoenn Pokemon we have:

Sceptile, Blaziken, Swampert, Shedinja, Swalot, Grimer, Vibrava, Lileep, Anorith, Igglybuff, Jigglypuff, Vulpix, Pichu, Psyduck, Wynaut, Phanpy, Donphan, Heracross, Snorunt, Huntail, Gorebyss, Relicanth, Corsola, Beldum, Metang, all the legendaries.   


Also, Beldum is mistakenly listed as 7 instead of 0 in the graph. It's used as a placeholder for the Frontier Brains.
    I remember this part and my dumbass started over my old diamond because i didn’t know how to use the internet properly.  

You can see every Pokémon, however only one trainer has a Drifloon, and it’s one of the trainers in Fantina’s/Fantima’s ghost gym. When I was younger I just skipped that trainer and took her on. Since you can’t re-battle gym trainers once you’ve claimed the badge, i wasn’t able to see drifloon. 

I didn’t have any friends at the time who played Pokémon so couldn’t ask someone to trade me one to register it in my Pokédex. I scoured all over Sinnoh hoping to battle a trainer who had one but couldn’t find one. I even took on the battle tower (this was before I even Knew about EV training/Perfect iv’s) and kept battling trainers over and over (as well as losing and losing). Finally one trainer had a drifloon and my excited ass thought my search was over. 

Come to find out that battle tower Pokémon don’t register in your dex. Since you needed to see all the Pokémon available at that time to unlock the national dex, I thought i screwed myself over and reset my game. 

Years later you should have seen my face when it turned out that all i had to do was wait till Friday in my game to catch one :(
        F, Iirc, Driftloon is not even the only one, the only trainer to use Haunter is also in her Gym
            You could trade a medicham to that piece of shit Mindy in Snowpoint to register a haunter though
    I'd love to see the stats for Platinum specifically because you can encounter every Pokemon in the Sinnoh Dex through a trainer battle.
        Not sure about Platinum, but I've been playing quite a lot of Diamond and Pearl lately that I pretty much know what trainer to fight to see which Pokémon
    Another reason why I love gen 4
    I think Gen 5 does the same thing. Or, at least, I know that B2W2 does
r/dataisbeautiful
I included all battles in the game. This includes each version of the May/Brendan battles, which is why the starters appear so many times. I did this because I also wanted to include the rematches with trainers where they start to use more interesting Pokemon; also I'm lazy.

I got this info from the decompiled Emerald found [here.](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/blob/master/src/data/trainer_parties.h)

If you noticed a Pokemon only used once, like Steelix, it's likely because of trainer rematches. The Gym Leaders especially like to use more interesting Pokemon in their rematches.

Edit: For some reason the Frontier Brains are listed as having a single lvl 5 Beldum instead of their actual teams. So their real teams are missing from the data and Beldum should be listed as 0 not 7. Sorry Beldum.
    I assume that the Battle Frontier Brains were not applied to this data set (6 of the 7). I believe there were quite a few legendaries used, like the eon duo and the Regi trio.
        Branden uses both the Regi Trio and the Bird Trio depending on challenge
        Frontier Brains are in the list but have entirely the wrong data. They're listed as having a single lvl 5 Beldum each and that's it. My bad for not realising.
    Do they have this data available for other Pokemon games? I had been thinking of trying to do an ML project with npc trainer data, but it's hard to get enough samples.
    Does this include battle frontier?
        No. The trainers at the frontier aren't true NPCs are their teams are generated through hard code rather than a data file. That said, the Frontier Brains are a weird case where their teams are incorrectly listed as having a single lvl 5 Beldum each.
            Interesting, thank you for all this information
At first I was surprised Zubat was so low but then I remembered Hoenn is like 90% water
    Well, 78%.
        enough to give hoenn a 7/10
            thatsthejoke.gif
    Zubat is mostly a wild Pokemon in caves, where it appears a lot.
Why does no trainer use Chimecho in Ruby and Sapphire. I had a missing spot for years in the dex and it was only when I saw a guide that I saw that weird design. Of course, this was before James got one in the anime.
    Iirc it was like the last Pokémon added to the game.
Oh wow... I honestly didn't expect Marill to be on top, that's... interesting.
    that pokemon was everywhere to be heard i was expecting top 5 for it.

I'm more surprised about Hariyama, I remember using Hariyama a lot in my playthroughs but never recall fighting it a lot
        Yeah, it's interesting how weirdly distributed some of them are, haha.
        If I remember correctly every Ace Trainer in Victory Road had at least 1 Hariyama.
    I expected Peliper, its evolution line wins by a lot.
        It's just that we see Peliper a lot besides NPC, it has us kinda conditioned to think that. And Wingulls.
which trainer uses houndoom?
    Flannery in her rematch.
    Flannery in rematch (?)
        Yes you can re-battle the gym leaders... you didn't know ?
7.8/10 too much water
    Dude, I hard agree with that review after I actually read it. I replayed Emerald recently and my Manectric was waaaaaaaay stronger than the rest of the team once surf came into play. Half the routes are water and basically all the water route trainers only use water types.

Plus, dear god. They should've made kelp tiles be the only place to encounter pokemon on water routes. I shouldn't HAVE to buy repels just to make traveling bearable. The worst part is, they literally already implemented this into the dive section around Sootopolis.
        THANK YOU  
Someone read the review and understands the problem is the amount of water type POKEMON. It sucks that water pokemon are all water types but land pokemon are divided into everything else
            I always urge people to actually read that review. I'm just sayin', a good number of people who meme on it only read the bullet point next to the final score, not even the small synopsis at the bottom which serves as a better summary of the complaint than "Too much water" ("Still, a few of its flaws are even more glaring in 3D, especially the excess water Pokémon and often dull navigation of their habitats.").

There's a reason IGN stopped doing the bullet points, even going so far as to retroactively remove them from the ORAS review. And it's because the majority of folks online won't read any of the rest of the review if they're there.

The topic of that review always gets me heated.
                If the +/- summary at the end had more negative bullet points it wouldn’t be clowned as much. People were just mad that the reviewer gave the game a 7.8 score (which, hot take... is actually a totally fair score for ORAS) and wrote it off as dumb reasoning. 

Even then, “too much water” is a totally valid complaint for Hoenn. The last third of the game being mostly relatively boring water routes is bad game design, and a remake is exactly the place where you should fix it to make it more interesting and more balanced Pokemon distribution-wise.
                    I mean to be fair when it comes to remakes, they never really drastically alter routes and what Pokémon are found on them. Kinda like how half the johto Pokémon are still literally nonexistent in the johto games.
                Honestly it’s just really funny to me. Like, that’s literally the only negative bullet point. You’re definitely right, the review makes plenty of very valid points and justifies its stance very well, but that doesn’t stop “7.8/10 too much water” from being funny. It’s both funny and valid.
            This so much. The problem with Hoenn wasn't "too much water", it was "too bland water". Every ocean tile is the same and their encounter tables only contain two Pokémon families, unless you stop to fish or dive. Hoenn had this massive "land vs. sea" thing built up, but executed it so poorly in that all the sea routes combined had less variety than any single land route. The sea isn't inherently bland, as illustrated by, for instance, *Finding Nemo* or in later years, *Subnautica*. The ocean should be teeming with diverse life and contain several different biomes, but instead it's portrayed as a vast, bland expanse of sameyness. Where are the coral reefs, the sand banks, the kelp forests, the outlets of rivers, the harbours, the industrial pollution if they want to be environmental? OK, maybe it wouldn't have been possible on the GBA, but ORAS could definitely have picked up the slack there. Or at least Gen VII, but alas ...
                What the review pointed out was a balancing issue, too many water type Pokémon would make electric types like manectric way too overleved.

This was never about Hoenn's water routes being bland
            Water is the most commun type, even more than normal.
            Later generations introduced more aquatic Pokémon that aren’t water type.
            Just give me ONE fucking fire type! That's all I ask for. If you don't pick Chimchar you don't have a fire type until after the Pokemon League

Edit: I got gen 3 and 4 mixed up...
                chimchar? 🤔
                    Oh yeah I totally got gen 3 and 4 mixed up haha. Oops!
                You're thinking of Gen 4. Chimchar is Gen 4, not Gen 3.

Gen 3 had Camerupt, Torkoal, Magcargo, Ninetales, that's a fairly large selection of Fire types.

Gen 4 was the one where you basically were stuck with Ponyta or Flareon.
                    Yeah my bad!
                    Just Ponyta in Diamond and Pearl until after you beat Cynthia.
            Well fans complain endlessly when aquatic Pokémon aren’t water type.
        Gen III actually has a much worse encounter rate for water routes. They actually fixed it by toning it down in the remakes.
        Yeah, often when people say "too much water" it's in the sense that all water tiles are encounter tiles. It's be like if every land based route was 100% covered in tall grass. It becomes a tedious slog. Doubly so when there's barely any variance in the pokemon you're seeing.
    Idk, I quite liked Pokémon: Windwaker
    Hoenn Region in a nutshell lol.
    Maxie was right, we were too blind to see it.
The fact that silcoon and castcoon both only have 1 trainer(the same guy iirc), amazes me. Bug trainers always seem to refuse to evolve them, but I guess hoenn is different.
    That's why there's bug maniacs, they are maniacs that evolve their bugs.
    If we did the same thing in Sinnoh Silcoon and Cascoon would probably be 10 each. Every other Galactic grunt used them.
[removed]
    And they were everywhere in gens 3 and 4.
        And 7.
Stephen and his metogross rockin the bottom slot
This deserves way more upvotes than what it currently has. Should be at a million. That sir, is dedication.
Now make a graph of how often Martin’s Solrock uses Cosmic Power.
I assume the battle facilities are excluded
Neat! Would you have a list of all the Pokemon NOT used by any NPC's (that's still in the Hoenn Dex)?
    I'd assume it'd be only legendaries/mythicals
The fact that Roselia is the second most used Pokémon in Emerald but totally unavailable without friends shlould be criminal. You do not know how many times I were so close to tears, knowing very well that I'll never be able to enjoy Roselia in a Pokémon game :'(. In every generation past Emerald I just cannot have Roselia in my team, knowing I never had her in the Team I wanted her to be...
    I mean wild budew are everywhere i gen 6, 7, and 8
        Or in Gen 4, where it's basically the only grass type since the rest are bad and/or annoying to get
            i guess thats how I ended up using it and it becoming my fave pokemon lol
        Yeah that's totally true but it's not the same, you know? I always longed to have Roselia in my team in Emerald so that now it just feels wrong to have it outside Gen 3 lol. Maybe when I play again I'll try having it in my team
Am I the only one who scrolled, back scrolled and scrolled again for the satisfaction?
the gen 3 production team at gamefreak really loved wingull and pelipper huh xD
How the frickk was Skarmory used so often??? They are so hard to find!!
C H I M E C O
Marill at the top makes some sense because this is Hoenn after all, but who are the 40 trainers using Roselia of all Pokemon? Where did that come from?
You know, i thought Linoone and Mightyena would have been top dogs for sure.
    Peliper is the top dog.
Wow. Just, wow.
That one Milotic trainer ended my career as a child
Ok so with this data which is the best starter pokemon? its Trecko if we look at the most common.
I honestly didn’t know chimecho existed because I never saw that trainer and never ran into it.
Pokémon Emerald NPCs believe in Marill Supremacy
Emerald, stop trying to make Pikablu happen. It's not going to happen!
"too much water"
This is awesome! Can you do some more for other games?
Awesome graph! I would love to see ones for other game versions too hehe
Way to go Marill!
I'm surprised wingull was so low down the list
    hes number 4 wdym
        I mean he should be number 1... Fucker was everywhere
I'm glad pokemon like Milotic, Salamence, and Metagross live up to their nature as unique and powerful
Chimecho was originally going to be a legend, right? hence why it's so rare in game and only found in wild in a WEIRD area they didn't do that until late in the cycle.
Interesting data!


I’d love to see how this changed in ORAS also. What new Pokémon got used the most?
Interesting. You will only see Silcoon and Cascoon once in the very early game then that's it. Does this possibly apply to Metapod and Kakuna perhaps? Maybe.
I knew there was a reason I hated Wingull/Pelliper so much. That’s a lot of protect spam.
Too many Pelippers...
This game made me hate wingulls. So basic.
What trainer uses HootHoot?
    flying gym leader in her first rematch
I appreciate that ties are sorted in pokedex order.
I'd love to see this for other games like Platinum
I’m only used once :(
I expected Glalie to be used more...
someones got alot of time on their hands. not saying that's a bad thing, this is awesome
I can totally believe Marill, as I always recall Hoenn as the Marill HUB.
Cool graph! Being a little nitpicky, I would have put the numbers on the right side.
I would love to see this sorted by the pokemon's base stat values rather than by most to least used.
I need more
I like to play Pokemon games and NOT use and Pokemon owned by an NPC. In Emerald’s case, Swalot, Shedinja, Wobbuffet, and Donphan all count towards this.
Get a girlfriend
r/bored
You outdid yourself with this.  This is great
r/nextfuckinglevel
Are u ok bro
Respect.
You have done the Lord's work!
Without seeing the list I would have been able to guess the top 3. They're everywhere.
18?
Well, now I gots to know for other games too.
How the hell was cascoon and silcoon only used once?!
And who can blame them, marill is effing adorable!
Chimecho was used in the Battle Arena, right?
Because I remember Chimecho an a mysterious empty space on my Pokedex.
I definitely didn't think Marill of all pokemon would top the list. I expected Poochyena or something.
Hmm. I guess it kind of makes sense considering how much water there is in the region. Pikablu is fav pokemom.
My boy Marill is so popular
Does that include battle tower?
You could have gone to college!!
Brilliant. My least favourite Pokémon is the third most common in NPC battles. Juuuust brilliant.
I didn't expect Maril and Roselia to be so popular in Hoenn
Ngl this is the most random data set I never knew I needed
Like no one asked for this data but very insightful ahah
Thus too much water makes a lot more sense in this context.  So many water types topping that list. 6 of the top 10.
Oh my Arceus
How long did this take yoy
How is magikarp not at the top with all the fisherman?
Needs more fire and electric. Needs less normal, flying, dark, poison
But why..
Respect to thet stat man
Damn. Aggron is my all time favourite pokemon, and seeing him being used only two times, makes me sad:(
Huh
Classify this further into tiers - OU etx
It reminds me of those BDSM charts
Water water everywhere
I miss my copy of emerald. I want to replace it but nobody has copies anymore
Does this include VS Scanner evolutions?
and none use buneary or lopunny...

sadness.
fuckin marill man
r/dataisbeautiful
Where are these 3 NPCs that use my beloved Absol? I don't recall
Huh, I had no idea Marill was so popular in Hoenn.
Wow makes so much sense why I don't use any of those top battled pokemon. Always countering them.

But yea good question why is a gen 2 poekmon the most common opponent in gen 3. Would love to see this analysis on gen 2 as well.
Pikachu: 2

Ah the good old days
Rayquaza 0
I must have this data for the other games!
\*sad Chimecho noises
Thats somewhat useful because I play an emerald emulator
Dude this is ducking awesome
I swear... They all have a roselia
Who else just looked at the lowest and highest?
I could've sworn i seen a lot more Onix
You clearly didn't break ties by alphabetical order.

How *did* you break them?
    Pokedex number
        understandable have a good day
Now with this data determine what 6 pokemon are the best to take on all trainers considering what pokemon are used the most
This makes me very happy
Need
Okay, but

*why*
Top 4 are pretty accurate from my memory lol
I didn’t expect Marill to be so high, Linoone and Machoke are more or less as common as I expected
I never would have thought you’d fight as many Slaking as you fight Magikarp
Hypno 18? What? The Drowzee line wasn’t even in the Hoenn dex.
I remember feeling that I was fighting Roselia and the Peliper line at every battle.
Lol the first thing I did was scroll to the bottom
No Rayquaza 0/10
Wingul’s gen 3-5 cry is ingrained into my head.
Legend i wish i could give you an ward but i cant so take my upvote instead
These guys just love Marill don't they
Weird that Chimecho only appears once!  The Johto Pokémon make sense, but not the Hoenn Pokémon!
Ahh this is the sort of content I'm here for! Cudos.
This is super cool. Makes me want to do it for SwSh
r/nextfuckinglevel
The results may surprise you
Wtf only one muk, I recalled I've seen like a million of em
It's okay Salamence. *I* still love you.
I think I forgot that a chimecho even existed
4 people using Kabuto like they aren’t extinct
One of the reasons I hate wingull and marill
I tought Zubat would be first, damn bats...
Holy shit that's a lot of data!
Not surprised that almost all are water pokemons.
How do you make an image post on here?
Hmm based on the top 10 most used Poke'mon, 6 of them have Water typing. 6/10 too much Water.
Where shedinja?
where's shedinja
As someone who was very young when I got my first console, I got yellow, then I got emerald (skipping gen 2), so cue my surprise when I learnt maril *wasn't* a gen 3 Pokémon, in fact there are a lot of gen 2 Pokémon I still mistake for gen 3 like slugma, skarmory, corsola, and phampy (that last one is thanks to ash in the anime).
    Wait you’re telling me that slugma and skarmory are gen 2 o.O. How many more lies have I been told by the council?
        Skarmory was one of my core team in GSC, always made sure to get him as soon as I reached Blackthorn.

I had no idea Slugma/Magcargo were introduced in Gen 2. Apparently they were rare and only appeared on the Kanto Cycling Road!
            That was always one of my main grievances with Gen 2/the remakes, that loads of the cool Johto Pokémon couldn't be caught in Johto!
                Exactly! I hated that houndour couldn’t be encountered until way late into the Kanto postgame. A fire dark hell hound? Cmon, who doesn’t want that on their team?
                    Gen 2 and 4 made the mistake of making the new pokémon really hard to catch.
                        I vividly remember the Alola games having a similar issue too.
                    Yeah. They introduced a new type then only made one Pokemon of that type (Umbreon) available before postgame.

Whereas every Steel type was conceivably available before the E4 (aside from Skarmory being version exclusive).
                        I think you could get Tyranitar before E4 too.
                            And sneasel
                            Only in the remakes yeah.
                                Nope, never played the remakes.
                        And Murkrow? Or is it only available in the remakes?
                        And Murkrow? Or is it only available in the remakes?
                            Yeah sorry I meant in the OGs
                                Oh ok, I've only played HG where you can find Murkrows in the safari zone. They should have put some Houndours there too, now that I think about it.
                    Why i hate gen 2
                        I hear you, but I can’t say I hate gen2 for that. 

It’s probably all nostalgia at this point but young me going from yellow with its mono coloring to silver with all the colors and new Pokémon? It just felt so different and special and magical for me. Nothing will beat me discovering chinchou and being amazed at an electric/water type. And the mysticism of the roaming legendary beasts? Man, I loved that stuff as a kid 

It’s definitely flawed, I’ve seen that on replays (which is why I think that the remakes are some of the best Pokémon games made since there’s so much improvement on those flaws) but I just still look back so fondly on gen2
                            Pokemon Gold was my first Pokemon game and I still will say gen 2 is thrash.
                            Even the remakes are mediocre, since unless you have trades or randomizers (which most people don't) you are stuck with gen 1 and 2 Pokémon
                    I was more annoyed that it wasn't still there in FRLG. I'd been hoping to use one against Sabrina.
                You didn’t miss much with Magcargo. Trust me.
                    What?! You aint doing my exotic lunch item that way. Its a tonky fire type that learns some decent stab pretty early. It doesnt hold up well in competitive, but it is not bad in-game. (Or at least thats what i remember from my hgss nuzlocke lol)
                        Magcargo is one of the most flawed Pokemon in history. As the proud owner of the shiny KJ Hamler Magcargo, it makes me sad, but such is the reality.

-	4x weakness to Ground
-	4x weakness to Water
-	weakness to Rock, and by extension, a Stealth Rock weakness
-	Ridiculously slow
-	Terrible attack stat
-	Mediocre special attack
-	Mediocre special bulk
-	Lacking Rock STAB options
-	Weak Explosion
-	Lacking options to power itself up
                            Good incubator tho. I had one in Emerald.
                Same it’s so lame.
                It does totally suck, but it's mainly because the Gen II Pokemon weren't supposed to be "Johto Pokemon" so much as simply "newly discovered Pokemon". The problem is that by Gen III, they realized it wasn't realistic or logical for 100+ Pokemon to be "newly discovered" in every single game, so they changed the narrative to instead be that the "new Pokemon" hadn't been around before because they were native to the new region(s) — which left Johto in an awkward spot in retrospect.
            On that note, can we talk about how rubbish it is that there were Gen 2 Pokemon that only appeared in Kanto?
                Or Sneasel that wasn't available until My. Silver. Before HGSS, you couldn't get Larvitar until then either, but as of HGSS you can get Larvitar as early as the 6th gym I believe, with the safari zone
                    You can get Sneasel on Ice Path at night on Crystal but it's extremely rare
                        And you can bet your butt my dumb self sat in that area until I found one too after learning that tidbit. For a frost weasel/wolverine demon thing? Heck yeah!
                            They really did Sneasel dirty with that typing pre-gen 4 though... my guy is barely usable until the split
                            I did the same thing but it took me way too much time to understand that it only appears on the bottom floor. 9 year old me lost endless hours of pointless searching on the top floor just to meet Swinubs and Golbats.
                    Before the 5th gym, if you go out of your way for it, I believe.
                Yeah honestly it’s the reason why I can’t ever say Gen 2 is my favorite. The Pokémon distribution is terrible.
                    The post game was fantastic though. Felt like a whole new adventure. Wish all Pokémon games had a postgame like that
                        I hope the new generations will take the dlc (or have a better one in the main game) route and have great post game stuff
                Gen 2 suuuuucked
                    I feel it's a bit harsh to say it sucked, considering how many improvements it made over the original games, but not every shot it took landed, that's for sure.
                        It didn't improve the original. It had color and fixed some bugs. But the Pokémon and most mechanics introduced were awful
                            Let's go over a few things you missed

* Added two new types, which helped balance the type chart which was heavily skewed in favor of some types, notably Psychic.

* Split the special stat, making it less abusable than it was in Gen 1

* Held items, which was such a huge game changer that there are Pokemon in today's current meta who couldn't function at all without that addition.

* Added a clock system with different encounters, both with Pokemon and as in-game events, at different times depending on when you did them.

* Breeding, the thing that lets you get a Pokemon with better or even perfect IVs without having to catch hundreds of the same species.

* Shiny forms, just as a fun little trophy to say "I made an effort to seek out this Pokemon and got a reward."

* Improved graphics, which goes far beyond just "having color" as you said. There was more detail, more variety in sprites, and Crystal even gave us animated Pokemon.

* Rebattling trainers, something which was previously limited to the Pokemon League. You could even rematch gym leaders, which was impossible before.

* Trainers actually had names instead of just a title

* Apricorns

* The Pokegear

I could go on, if you like.
                                2 new types that were awful in gen 2
Held items that were all awful in gen 2
Clock system that is completely pointless in gen 2
Breeding, which is completely pointless in gen 2 due to lack of natures
Shinier that have less than a 1 in 8000 chance of showing up
Imporved graphics that do not hold up at all
Rebattling trainers was done infinitely better with the vs seeker as you could actually use it instead of waiting for a call
Pokegear which was a useless gimmick
Apricots that you could only get once a day
Want me to keep going?
                            Gen 2 is basically just everything they couldn’t fit into Gen 1, and it kinda shows.
                                Yeah..... that game doesn't hold up. At all
                    You sucked. Johto is the **best**, fite me!
                        Sure. Why are most johto Pokémon unattainable? All the good one require trade, transfer, or access to the post game.
                My gripe is that one tiny patch of grass in route 35 with a 1 percent chance of yanma. I’ve been keeping count on a play through and I’m at 167 encounters without seeing one, wounded
            Haha yeah. There's an NPC that tells you about slugma being there.
            I love skarmory but i miss its old idle stance. In pokemon stadium and the sprite based games it looked great. Post XY it's "airplane" stance looks so terrible to the point its almost comedy.
            Which makes them kanto Pokémon
            Houndour wasn’t until the cycling road in gen 2 either. Like wtf houndour is definitely not found only in Kanto
            This is the problem I have with Gen 2. Why introduce new Pokémon only to lock them behind postgame? 

Another issue I have is that most of the gym leaders are using Gen 1 Pokémon! As their aces too. Why the fuck couldn’t Morty use the only representative of the type from that generation on his team?
                I think it’s because gold and silver weren’t designed to be “the next generation” of Pokémon games, they were designed to be THE definitive final pokemon games. A ton of the decisions/flaws make more sense when you consider that the series was never supposed to go beyond crystal.
                    Okay I see your point, but why couldn’t they rectify this in HGSS at the very least?
        In fairness, Skarmory was Silver exclusive, so it's possible you missed it entirely.
        Yup! I have to do a double take every time I think about what gen they are from, I've always felt like gen 2 is kind of like a weird "dlc" of gen 1, like it doesn't quite fit as a standalone, and takes aspects that would have been part of kanto and hoenn and mashes them together in the middle.
            As a trainer that got started in Johto I strongly disagree with you, but as someone that skipped two and played 1 & 3, I can see how you got there.
            no way, the second generation added so much; held items, a completely new region with like 100+ new pokemon, new evolution lines for kanto pokemon, berry crafting, tons of the different ball types, the sp def stat (no longer based off sp like in gen 1), breeding, several awesome legendaries and dungeons, and even added kanto as a part of it. 


Silver and Gold (and Crytal but never played that one) were probably the biggest jump in content from one gen to the next in terms of touching **everything**, definitely the one that had the most intros of core features (breeding and held items are a **huge** part of the meta).
                The first 4 gens all had pretty significant jumps, it was only after Sinnoh that things kind of slowed down.
                    Well, Black and White introduced Hidden Abilities which really helped certain Pokemon a lot by giving them new uses in battle. X and Y gave us Fairy-types. After *that* yeah, things slowed down.
                Don't forget two new, important types!
                Of those, only the special split and held items really seem like things that wouldn't be slotted in DLC. Even new types feel like it'd be something you could add in DLC for a series with only 1 game.

Heck, of the 100 (why did you say 100+, there were literally 99+celebi?), many of them were already conceptualized for gen 1 but didn't make the initial cut.
                    breeding is completely novel, introduced eggs and baby pokemon. Those are gigantic DLC asks imo
                        Yeah but it's not something unheard of. I guess it's more an expansion than a conventional DLC, but yeah, adding mechanics of that size isn't that unheard of in an expansion.
            To be fair it kinda was. A lot of the 100 were planned pokemon for gen 1 that they didn't have time/space to slot into the OG game.
        For real! Blows my mind lol
        Lol I'm also shocked. I really believed they were gen 3
        I confuse those 2 for gen 3 pokemon too! I wonder if they're just that more common?
            A lot of Gen 2 Pokemon were really hard to find - Skarmory for example is very rare in one location in one game in Gen 2.  A bunch of cool Gen 2 Pokemon like Slugma, Houndour, Misdreavus, Murkrow, etc. weren't available to be caught until the post-game while being relatively accessible in Gen 3.
        Corsola is also gen 2
        Oh shit I had pokemon gold... Apparently it was only natural in Silver and Emerald. But then I also had 245 pokemon in Gold (until a little prick wiped my fucking save the piece of shit). I always assumed Skarmory was gen 3... I used to catch him up on that ashy volcano area where you collect soot for pokeflutes.
        In fairness, while Slugma was Gen 2, it was also only in Kanto, and if I recall, was only on the cycle path (routes 16, 17, 18). Probably easy to miss.
        SkarmBliss was even one of the most dominant forces in the gen 2 metagame if I'm not very mistaken.
        If you plaued Gold you would never see a Skarmory since no trainers use it and its version exclusive.
        Holy crap the Slugma bomb literally blew my mind lol
    Corsola has a big part in the lore of a town, and overall fits Gen 3 much more. I dont even remember where you get Corsola in Gen 2. Slugma also fits Gen 3 much better, since a volcano is more prominent in Gen 3, as well as Team Magma being a thing. Slugma seems like an afterthought in GSC.
        Apparently it can be caught using the good rod in the exact same place you get it (Olivine City). I'll admit though, I don't remember Corsola in gen 2 myself. Maybe it's another one of those Pokemon that NPC's don't really use.
        Id add chinchou to the list since we go visit underwater locations in RSE.

OTOH tho RSE is more focused on the environment and nature, whereas GSC is the conflict between traditions and modernism (where Kanto is the modern region and Johto more traditional). So I guess it makes sense, but ut doesn't ignore that Johto has the worst distribution of new pokemon of every region. And I feel like every route has the same wild pokemon whereas RSE and DPP it was always unique
    Wait, Slugma isn't gen 3... wut
        This one always blows my mind as well. There's a cave you can find it in post-Johto.
            Yeah weirdly Slugma and Houndour are found in Kanto.
                And murkrow, and larvitar, and misdreavus, and half of the trade evolution items
                    Johto is the region with the least amount of Johto pokémon.
                    In HGSS you can get Larvitar pretty early via the Safari Zone. I used Tyranitar on my last playthrough
                        HGSS fixes a lot of tye distribution problems between the safari, walker, and other features. I also feel as though Cliff Cave and the safari helped fix the leveling too. Like just a bit more for people to do before the late Johto game.

Misdreavus and murkrow are available thru the safari or cliff cave too. I used misdreavus-> msimagius on both my HG and SS runs. 

Not a distribution problem, but Extrasensory on the egg Togepi makes Togetic much more viable as a pokemon. Maybe makes Morty and Chuck too easy but was a very welcome change
    Yeah I used to think Togepi was a gen 1 Pokémon because of the show.
        Kinda was, Togepi, Ho-oh, Marill and a few others were cut from R/B due to tech limitiations
    Forgetting Slugma is forgivable. You can’t even get it until late into postgame and it isn’t great. Houndour at least has a really cool design and was a fancy new Dark-type
    I actually though Medicham was a Gen IV Pokemon because it was so common in Sinnoh
    TIL Slugma is Gen 2.
    it was the reverse for me. as a kid i was absolutely positive volbeat and illumise were gen 2
        Cause of Camp Pikachu? It was a Gen 2 movie.
    Hell I just learned that chimecho isn't gen 4
        Well I can’t blame you, it’s chingling that’s gen 4 right?
            Okay, that’s one I actually didn’t know. 

So... why did Gen 4 decide Chimecho needed a pre-evo?
                Gen 4 gave us multiple pre evolutions for pretty much no reason. Chingling, Happiny, Bonsly, Munchlax, and Mantyke.

Some other Pokémon that needed evos pretty desperately got them too, at least.
    i always thought slugma was gen 3 too
    I always thought macargo, slugma, and skarmory were gen 3 too.
    Those were all pretty hard to obtain in GSC as well. I like to believe that Pokémon like Slugma are actually native to Hoenn and only migrated to Kanto a few years after RBY.
    My first pokemon game was colloseum (weird i know)  so all gen 2&3 pokemon are the same gen to me
    CORSOLA AND PHANPHY ARE GEN 2!?
    Corsola blew my mind as a kid when i found out they were gen 2 and skarmory
    I had no idea slugma and skarmory were gen 2 Pokémon
    Same but leaf green to ruby, I still have to remind myself about Skarmory being gen 2 occasionally.
    A lot of people think Skarmory is Gen 3. I know it was gen 2 because of the anime but I don't remember ever seeing the Pokemon in the game.
    Same. FR was my first fame then I jumped into Emerald. I was so confused at how many gen 3 pokes were actually gen 2
    Skarmory always felt like a gen 3 pokemon, just something about its design just shouted Hoenn.
    As someone who played gen 4 first, I was sure all the pokemon I found were introduced in that gen. I was very surprised to learn that common things like Tentacool, Ponyta and Psyduck were actually older than me when I got the national dex.
I have a headcanon thet Roselia was imported from Sinnoh and there's a Roselia trend going on in Hoenn which is why a lot of trainers use then but they aren't found in the wild (in emerald)
    I do think that some of the Kanto and Hoenn pokemon are from Sinnoh. But my headcanon was Snorlax not Roselia-thats why we see 2 snorlax in Kanto but Mumchlax are all over Sinnoh.
No wonder IGN gave it "too much water/10."
It's also absolute dogshit for base EXP yield (58 exp). The next most used Pokemon in Emerald, Roselia, has a base EXP yield of 152.
Tbf azurill was introduced in this generation I believe, and marill is just its next stage.
Genuinely surprised it wasn't a Gen I one.
    Gen III did have FR/LG as enhanced remakes of Gen I.
Hey, don’t knock it if it works
It has a gen III prevolution, so that's semething.
I guess that explains why Marill feels so much like a Gen 3 Pokemon
It bothers me that Marill is at the top when Corphish is only used once by an NPC, I’ve always loved it and wished it was more common as an early game water type.
I instantly expected it to top the chart. Like, every single grunt seems to be using it. Then again some use mightyena later into the game so the number makes sense, add to the fact that few use them outside of the grunts.
    True, but I believe the grunt “model” that does appear frequently in game only counts for one in this chart.
        Each unique grunt trainer is accounted for. I think Poochyena feels more common because it's in so many required battles.
Poochyena and Mightyena do account for 50 trainer Pokémon, mostly in required battles, so they're very present.
Did I not see Shedinja?
    Right, no one used that thing, presumably because someone might not be able to battle it
        Imagine Phoebe using one and ending your run with it
            [deleted]
                So what is the deal, can this pokemon be killed by super effective moves or is it only damaged by critical hits?
                    Super effective moves only.
                    Only by supereffective moves. Since it's bug/ghost, it can only be damaged by flying, rock, ghost, fire, or dark attacks, and since it's set at exactly 1 HP, any of the above is an automatic one-hit KO.
                    Weather as well
                        And status effects like poison
                    Super-effective moves only, but it also takes damage from stuff like hazards, weather, status, so it's a lot worse than it actually looks.
                        Would be really cool but I assumed flying, ghost, and fire moves are pretty common in competitive play right? Seems like a pokemon that has a really cool concept but not fully executed
                            I think giving it so many weaknesses was probably for balance purposes

It's exceptionally hard to balance a Pokemon like that
            In Colosseum this can happen to you.  On Mt. Battle, battle 99 has a Shedinja and can completely wall you right before the end.
                On the one hand, that's evil and I love it.

On the other hand, if you got up to level 99 on Mt. Battle, you probably have *something* to hit a Bug/Ghost type for super effective damage, or failing that, something with Will-o-Wisp/Toxic/Sand Stream/etc.
                    Mt. Battle is not difficult, just time consuming. You don't need status moves to get through it. I completed it with my kid strategy of only attack moves on all Pokémon. And unlike things like Battle Tower, legendaries are allowed on Mt. Battle.

So yeah, with that kid strategy, there's a big possibility to hit fight 99 and have no counter to Shedinja.
    There aren't even any fully evolved starters as the rival still uses Grovyle/Combusken/Marshtomb in the final battle against them.
        When I was a kid I always found it odd that you basically intimidate your best friend into retirement from battling at the age of 10.
            I think this happens to Hop too pretty much.  Or you bully him into no longer trying to be the best.
                Perhaps he shouldn’t suck so hard then, at least hau put up a bit of a fight with that fucking riachu of his
                    The last strong rival was Blue.
                        Barry is actually pretty strong, silver is no joke either
                    Regular SM Hau with his Komala was pretty sucky, but **Ultra** SM Hau with Noivern/Tauros was a lot more of a contender.
                He still battles (and if you have Shield, his final fight where he has Zacian is a pain in the ass) but he stops obsessing over becoming champion.
        Iirc they were even above the level they would need to be at to evolve? Might be misremembering tho.
    Yeah, Nincada at 5. Ninjask at 12.

Shedinja at no.
    I could be misremembering but I believe you can find a single trainer with Shedinja on the route after Meteor Falls (between Meteor Falls and the first gym city). I believe you need surf so if I'm right it makes sense that many people didn't come across it.

Edit : Never mind I am apparently misremembering it with Ninjask. Either that or I met one in a randomizer there (looked up on Serebii's PokeEarth).
Had a look through the list of 0 used and for regional Hoenn Pokemon we have:

Sceptile, Blaziken, Swampert, Shedinja, Swalot, Grimer, Vibrava, Lileep, Anorith, Igglybuff, Jigglypuff, Vulpix, Pichu, Psyduck, Wynaut, Phanpy, Donphan, Heracross, Snorunt, Huntail, Gorebyss, Relicanth, Corsola, Beldum, Metang, all the legendaries.   


Also, Beldum is mistakenly listed as 7 instead of 0 in the graph. It's used as a placeholder for the Frontier Brains.
I remember this part and my dumbass started over my old diamond because i didn’t know how to use the internet properly.  

You can see every Pokémon, however only one trainer has a Drifloon, and it’s one of the trainers in Fantina’s/Fantima’s ghost gym. When I was younger I just skipped that trainer and took her on. Since you can’t re-battle gym trainers once you’ve claimed the badge, i wasn’t able to see drifloon. 

I didn’t have any friends at the time who played Pokémon so couldn’t ask someone to trade me one to register it in my Pokédex. I scoured all over Sinnoh hoping to battle a trainer who had one but couldn’t find one. I even took on the battle tower (this was before I even Knew about EV training/Perfect iv’s) and kept battling trainers over and over (as well as losing and losing). Finally one trainer had a drifloon and my excited ass thought my search was over. 

Come to find out that battle tower Pokémon don’t register in your dex. Since you needed to see all the Pokémon available at that time to unlock the national dex, I thought i screwed myself over and reset my game. 

Years later you should have seen my face when it turned out that all i had to do was wait till Friday in my game to catch one :(
    F, Iirc, Driftloon is not even the only one, the only trainer to use Haunter is also in her Gym
        You could trade a medicham to that piece of shit Mindy in Snowpoint to register a haunter though
I'd love to see the stats for Platinum specifically because you can encounter every Pokemon in the Sinnoh Dex through a trainer battle.
    Not sure about Platinum, but I've been playing quite a lot of Diamond and Pearl lately that I pretty much know what trainer to fight to see which Pokémon
Another reason why I love gen 4
I think Gen 5 does the same thing. Or, at least, I know that B2W2 does
I assume that the Battle Frontier Brains were not applied to this data set (6 of the 7). I believe there were quite a few legendaries used, like the eon duo and the Regi trio.
    Branden uses both the Regi Trio and the Bird Trio depending on challenge
    Frontier Brains are in the list but have entirely the wrong data. They're listed as having a single lvl 5 Beldum each and that's it. My bad for not realising.
Do they have this data available for other Pokemon games? I had been thinking of trying to do an ML project with npc trainer data, but it's hard to get enough samples.
Does this include battle frontier?
    No. The trainers at the frontier aren't true NPCs are their teams are generated through hard code rather than a data file. That said, the Frontier Brains are a weird case where their teams are incorrectly listed as having a single lvl 5 Beldum each.
        Interesting, thank you for all this information
Well, 78%.
    enough to give hoenn a 7/10
        thatsthejoke.gif
Zubat is mostly a wild Pokemon in caves, where it appears a lot.
Iirc it was like the last Pokémon added to the game.
that pokemon was everywhere to be heard i was expecting top 5 for it.

I'm more surprised about Hariyama, I remember using Hariyama a lot in my playthroughs but never recall fighting it a lot
    Yeah, it's interesting how weirdly distributed some of them are, haha.
    If I remember correctly every Ace Trainer in Victory Road had at least 1 Hariyama.
I expected Peliper, its evolution line wins by a lot.
    It's just that we see Peliper a lot besides NPC, it has us kinda conditioned to think that. And Wingulls.
Flannery in her rematch.
Flannery in rematch (?)
    Yes you can re-battle the gym leaders... you didn't know ?
Dude, I hard agree with that review after I actually read it. I replayed Emerald recently and my Manectric was waaaaaaaay stronger than the rest of the team once surf came into play. Half the routes are water and basically all the water route trainers only use water types.

Plus, dear god. They should've made kelp tiles be the only place to encounter pokemon on water routes. I shouldn't HAVE to buy repels just to make traveling bearable. The worst part is, they literally already implemented this into the dive section around Sootopolis.
    THANK YOU  
Someone read the review and understands the problem is the amount of water type POKEMON. It sucks that water pokemon are all water types but land pokemon are divided into everything else
        I always urge people to actually read that review. I'm just sayin', a good number of people who meme on it only read the bullet point next to the final score, not even the small synopsis at the bottom which serves as a better summary of the complaint than "Too much water" ("Still, a few of its flaws are even more glaring in 3D, especially the excess water Pokémon and often dull navigation of their habitats.").

There's a reason IGN stopped doing the bullet points, even going so far as to retroactively remove them from the ORAS review. And it's because the majority of folks online won't read any of the rest of the review if they're there.

The topic of that review always gets me heated.
            If the +/- summary at the end had more negative bullet points it wouldn’t be clowned as much. People were just mad that the reviewer gave the game a 7.8 score (which, hot take... is actually a totally fair score for ORAS) and wrote it off as dumb reasoning. 

Even then, “too much water” is a totally valid complaint for Hoenn. The last third of the game being mostly relatively boring water routes is bad game design, and a remake is exactly the place where you should fix it to make it more interesting and more balanced Pokemon distribution-wise.
                I mean to be fair when it comes to remakes, they never really drastically alter routes and what Pokémon are found on them. Kinda like how half the johto Pokémon are still literally nonexistent in the johto games.
            Honestly it’s just really funny to me. Like, that’s literally the only negative bullet point. You’re definitely right, the review makes plenty of very valid points and justifies its stance very well, but that doesn’t stop “7.8/10 too much water” from being funny. It’s both funny and valid.
        This so much. The problem with Hoenn wasn't "too much water", it was "too bland water". Every ocean tile is the same and their encounter tables only contain two Pokémon families, unless you stop to fish or dive. Hoenn had this massive "land vs. sea" thing built up, but executed it so poorly in that all the sea routes combined had less variety than any single land route. The sea isn't inherently bland, as illustrated by, for instance, *Finding Nemo* or in later years, *Subnautica*. The ocean should be teeming with diverse life and contain several different biomes, but instead it's portrayed as a vast, bland expanse of sameyness. Where are the coral reefs, the sand banks, the kelp forests, the outlets of rivers, the harbours, the industrial pollution if they want to be environmental? OK, maybe it wouldn't have been possible on the GBA, but ORAS could definitely have picked up the slack there. Or at least Gen VII, but alas ...
            What the review pointed out was a balancing issue, too many water type Pokémon would make electric types like manectric way too overleved.

This was never about Hoenn's water routes being bland
        Water is the most commun type, even more than normal.
        Later generations introduced more aquatic Pokémon that aren’t water type.
        Just give me ONE fucking fire type! That's all I ask for. If you don't pick Chimchar you don't have a fire type until after the Pokemon League

Edit: I got gen 3 and 4 mixed up...
            chimchar? 🤔
                Oh yeah I totally got gen 3 and 4 mixed up haha. Oops!
            You're thinking of Gen 4. Chimchar is Gen 4, not Gen 3.

Gen 3 had Camerupt, Torkoal, Magcargo, Ninetales, that's a fairly large selection of Fire types.

Gen 4 was the one where you basically were stuck with Ponyta or Flareon.
                Yeah my bad!
                Just Ponyta in Diamond and Pearl until after you beat Cynthia.
        Well fans complain endlessly when aquatic Pokémon aren’t water type.
    Gen III actually has a much worse encounter rate for water routes. They actually fixed it by toning it down in the remakes.
    Yeah, often when people say "too much water" it's in the sense that all water tiles are encounter tiles. It's be like if every land based route was 100% covered in tall grass. It becomes a tedious slog. Doubly so when there's barely any variance in the pokemon you're seeing.
Idk, I quite liked Pokémon: Windwaker
Hoenn Region in a nutshell lol.
Maxie was right, we were too blind to see it.
That's why there's bug maniacs, they are maniacs that evolve their bugs.
If we did the same thing in Sinnoh Silcoon and Cascoon would probably be 10 each. Every other Galactic grunt used them.
And they were everywhere in gens 3 and 4.
    And 7.
I'd assume it'd be only legendaries/mythicals
I mean wild budew are everywhere i gen 6, 7, and 8
    Or in Gen 4, where it's basically the only grass type since the rest are bad and/or annoying to get
        i guess thats how I ended up using it and it becoming my fave pokemon lol
    Yeah that's totally true but it's not the same, you know? I always longed to have Roselia in my team in Emerald so that now it just feels wrong to have it outside Gen 3 lol. Maybe when I play again I'll try having it in my team
Peliper is the top dog.
hes number 4 wdym
    I mean he should be number 1... Fucker was everywhere
flying gym leader in her first rematch
Pokedex number
    understandable have a good day
Wait you’re telling me that slugma and skarmory are gen 2 o.O. How many more lies have I been told by the council?
    Skarmory was one of my core team in GSC, always made sure to get him as soon as I reached Blackthorn.

I had no idea Slugma/Magcargo were introduced in Gen 2. Apparently they were rare and only appeared on the Kanto Cycling Road!
        That was always one of my main grievances with Gen 2/the remakes, that loads of the cool Johto Pokémon couldn't be caught in Johto!
            Exactly! I hated that houndour couldn’t be encountered until way late into the Kanto postgame. A fire dark hell hound? Cmon, who doesn’t want that on their team?
                Gen 2 and 4 made the mistake of making the new pokémon really hard to catch.
                    I vividly remember the Alola games having a similar issue too.
                Yeah. They introduced a new type then only made one Pokemon of that type (Umbreon) available before postgame.

Whereas every Steel type was conceivably available before the E4 (aside from Skarmory being version exclusive).
                    I think you could get Tyranitar before E4 too.
                        And sneasel
                        Only in the remakes yeah.
                            Nope, never played the remakes.
                    And Murkrow? Or is it only available in the remakes?
                    And Murkrow? Or is it only available in the remakes?
                        Yeah sorry I meant in the OGs
                            Oh ok, I've only played HG where you can find Murkrows in the safari zone. They should have put some Houndours there too, now that I think about it.
                Why i hate gen 2
                    I hear you, but I can’t say I hate gen2 for that. 

It’s probably all nostalgia at this point but young me going from yellow with its mono coloring to silver with all the colors and new Pokémon? It just felt so different and special and magical for me. Nothing will beat me discovering chinchou and being amazed at an electric/water type. And the mysticism of the roaming legendary beasts? Man, I loved that stuff as a kid 

It’s definitely flawed, I’ve seen that on replays (which is why I think that the remakes are some of the best Pokémon games made since there’s so much improvement on those flaws) but I just still look back so fondly on gen2
                        Pokemon Gold was my first Pokemon game and I still will say gen 2 is thrash.
                        Even the remakes are mediocre, since unless you have trades or randomizers (which most people don't) you are stuck with gen 1 and 2 Pokémon
                I was more annoyed that it wasn't still there in FRLG. I'd been hoping to use one against Sabrina.
            You didn’t miss much with Magcargo. Trust me.
                What?! You aint doing my exotic lunch item that way. Its a tonky fire type that learns some decent stab pretty early. It doesnt hold up well in competitive, but it is not bad in-game. (Or at least thats what i remember from my hgss nuzlocke lol)
                    Magcargo is one of the most flawed Pokemon in history. As the proud owner of the shiny KJ Hamler Magcargo, it makes me sad, but such is the reality.

-	4x weakness to Ground
-	4x weakness to Water
-	weakness to Rock, and by extension, a Stealth Rock weakness
-	Ridiculously slow
-	Terrible attack stat
-	Mediocre special attack
-	Mediocre special bulk
-	Lacking Rock STAB options
-	Weak Explosion
-	Lacking options to power itself up
                        Good incubator tho. I had one in Emerald.
            Same it’s so lame.
            It does totally suck, but it's mainly because the Gen II Pokemon weren't supposed to be "Johto Pokemon" so much as simply "newly discovered Pokemon". The problem is that by Gen III, they realized it wasn't realistic or logical for 100+ Pokemon to be "newly discovered" in every single game, so they changed the narrative to instead be that the "new Pokemon" hadn't been around before because they were native to the new region(s) — which left Johto in an awkward spot in retrospect.
        On that note, can we talk about how rubbish it is that there were Gen 2 Pokemon that only appeared in Kanto?
            Or Sneasel that wasn't available until My. Silver. Before HGSS, you couldn't get Larvitar until then either, but as of HGSS you can get Larvitar as early as the 6th gym I believe, with the safari zone
                You can get Sneasel on Ice Path at night on Crystal but it's extremely rare
                    And you can bet your butt my dumb self sat in that area until I found one too after learning that tidbit. For a frost weasel/wolverine demon thing? Heck yeah!
                        They really did Sneasel dirty with that typing pre-gen 4 though... my guy is barely usable until the split
                        I did the same thing but it took me way too much time to understand that it only appears on the bottom floor. 9 year old me lost endless hours of pointless searching on the top floor just to meet Swinubs and Golbats.
                Before the 5th gym, if you go out of your way for it, I believe.
            Yeah honestly it’s the reason why I can’t ever say Gen 2 is my favorite. The Pokémon distribution is terrible.
                The post game was fantastic though. Felt like a whole new adventure. Wish all Pokémon games had a postgame like that
                    I hope the new generations will take the dlc (or have a better one in the main game) route and have great post game stuff
            Gen 2 suuuuucked
                I feel it's a bit harsh to say it sucked, considering how many improvements it made over the original games, but not every shot it took landed, that's for sure.
                    It didn't improve the original. It had color and fixed some bugs. But the Pokémon and most mechanics introduced were awful
                        Let's go over a few things you missed

* Added two new types, which helped balance the type chart which was heavily skewed in favor of some types, notably Psychic.

* Split the special stat, making it less abusable than it was in Gen 1

* Held items, which was such a huge game changer that there are Pokemon in today's current meta who couldn't function at all without that addition.

* Added a clock system with different encounters, both with Pokemon and as in-game events, at different times depending on when you did them.

* Breeding, the thing that lets you get a Pokemon with better or even perfect IVs without having to catch hundreds of the same species.

* Shiny forms, just as a fun little trophy to say "I made an effort to seek out this Pokemon and got a reward."

* Improved graphics, which goes far beyond just "having color" as you said. There was more detail, more variety in sprites, and Crystal even gave us animated Pokemon.

* Rebattling trainers, something which was previously limited to the Pokemon League. You could even rematch gym leaders, which was impossible before.

* Trainers actually had names instead of just a title

* Apricorns

* The Pokegear

I could go on, if you like.
                            2 new types that were awful in gen 2
Held items that were all awful in gen 2
Clock system that is completely pointless in gen 2
Breeding, which is completely pointless in gen 2 due to lack of natures
Shinier that have less than a 1 in 8000 chance of showing up
Imporved graphics that do not hold up at all
Rebattling trainers was done infinitely better with the vs seeker as you could actually use it instead of waiting for a call
Pokegear which was a useless gimmick
Apricots that you could only get once a day
Want me to keep going?
                        Gen 2 is basically just everything they couldn’t fit into Gen 1, and it kinda shows.
                            Yeah..... that game doesn't hold up. At all
                You sucked. Johto is the **best**, fite me!
                    Sure. Why are most johto Pokémon unattainable? All the good one require trade, transfer, or access to the post game.
            My gripe is that one tiny patch of grass in route 35 with a 1 percent chance of yanma. I’ve been keeping count on a play through and I’m at 167 encounters without seeing one, wounded
        Haha yeah. There's an NPC that tells you about slugma being there.
        I love skarmory but i miss its old idle stance. In pokemon stadium and the sprite based games it looked great. Post XY it's "airplane" stance looks so terrible to the point its almost comedy.
        Which makes them kanto Pokémon
        Houndour wasn’t until the cycling road in gen 2 either. Like wtf houndour is definitely not found only in Kanto
        This is the problem I have with Gen 2. Why introduce new Pokémon only to lock them behind postgame? 

Another issue I have is that most of the gym leaders are using Gen 1 Pokémon! As their aces too. Why the fuck couldn’t Morty use the only representative of the type from that generation on his team?
            I think it’s because gold and silver weren’t designed to be “the next generation” of Pokémon games, they were designed to be THE definitive final pokemon games. A ton of the decisions/flaws make more sense when you consider that the series was never supposed to go beyond crystal.
                Okay I see your point, but why couldn’t they rectify this in HGSS at the very least?
    In fairness, Skarmory was Silver exclusive, so it's possible you missed it entirely.
    Yup! I have to do a double take every time I think about what gen they are from, I've always felt like gen 2 is kind of like a weird "dlc" of gen 1, like it doesn't quite fit as a standalone, and takes aspects that would have been part of kanto and hoenn and mashes them together in the middle.
        As a trainer that got started in Johto I strongly disagree with you, but as someone that skipped two and played 1 & 3, I can see how you got there.
        no way, the second generation added so much; held items, a completely new region with like 100+ new pokemon, new evolution lines for kanto pokemon, berry crafting, tons of the different ball types, the sp def stat (no longer based off sp like in gen 1), breeding, several awesome legendaries and dungeons, and even added kanto as a part of it. 


Silver and Gold (and Crytal but never played that one) were probably the biggest jump in content from one gen to the next in terms of touching **everything**, definitely the one that had the most intros of core features (breeding and held items are a **huge** part of the meta).
            The first 4 gens all had pretty significant jumps, it was only after Sinnoh that things kind of slowed down.
                Well, Black and White introduced Hidden Abilities which really helped certain Pokemon a lot by giving them new uses in battle. X and Y gave us Fairy-types. After *that* yeah, things slowed down.
            Don't forget two new, important types!
            Of those, only the special split and held items really seem like things that wouldn't be slotted in DLC. Even new types feel like it'd be something you could add in DLC for a series with only 1 game.

Heck, of the 100 (why did you say 100+, there were literally 99+celebi?), many of them were already conceptualized for gen 1 but didn't make the initial cut.
                breeding is completely novel, introduced eggs and baby pokemon. Those are gigantic DLC asks imo
                    Yeah but it's not something unheard of. I guess it's more an expansion than a conventional DLC, but yeah, adding mechanics of that size isn't that unheard of in an expansion.
        To be fair it kinda was. A lot of the 100 were planned pokemon for gen 1 that they didn't have time/space to slot into the OG game.
    For real! Blows my mind lol
    Lol I'm also shocked. I really believed they were gen 3
    I confuse those 2 for gen 3 pokemon too! I wonder if they're just that more common?
        A lot of Gen 2 Pokemon were really hard to find - Skarmory for example is very rare in one location in one game in Gen 2.  A bunch of cool Gen 2 Pokemon like Slugma, Houndour, Misdreavus, Murkrow, etc. weren't available to be caught until the post-game while being relatively accessible in Gen 3.
    Corsola is also gen 2
    Oh shit I had pokemon gold... Apparently it was only natural in Silver and Emerald. But then I also had 245 pokemon in Gold (until a little prick wiped my fucking save the piece of shit). I always assumed Skarmory was gen 3... I used to catch him up on that ashy volcano area where you collect soot for pokeflutes.
    In fairness, while Slugma was Gen 2, it was also only in Kanto, and if I recall, was only on the cycle path (routes 16, 17, 18). Probably easy to miss.
    SkarmBliss was even one of the most dominant forces in the gen 2 metagame if I'm not very mistaken.
    If you plaued Gold you would never see a Skarmory since no trainers use it and its version exclusive.
    Holy crap the Slugma bomb literally blew my mind lol
Corsola has a big part in the lore of a town, and overall fits Gen 3 much more. I dont even remember where you get Corsola in Gen 2. Slugma also fits Gen 3 much better, since a volcano is more prominent in Gen 3, as well as Team Magma being a thing. Slugma seems like an afterthought in GSC.
    Apparently it can be caught using the good rod in the exact same place you get it (Olivine City). I'll admit though, I don't remember Corsola in gen 2 myself. Maybe it's another one of those Pokemon that NPC's don't really use.
    Id add chinchou to the list since we go visit underwater locations in RSE.

OTOH tho RSE is more focused on the environment and nature, whereas GSC is the conflict between traditions and modernism (where Kanto is the modern region and Johto more traditional). So I guess it makes sense, but ut doesn't ignore that Johto has the worst distribution of new pokemon of every region. And I feel like every route has the same wild pokemon whereas RSE and DPP it was always unique
Wait, Slugma isn't gen 3... wut
    This one always blows my mind as well. There's a cave you can find it in post-Johto.
        Yeah weirdly Slugma and Houndour are found in Kanto.
            And murkrow, and larvitar, and misdreavus, and half of the trade evolution items
                Johto is the region with the least amount of Johto pokémon.
                In HGSS you can get Larvitar pretty early via the Safari Zone. I used Tyranitar on my last playthrough
                    HGSS fixes a lot of tye distribution problems between the safari, walker, and other features. I also feel as though Cliff Cave and the safari helped fix the leveling too. Like just a bit more for people to do before the late Johto game.

Misdreavus and murkrow are available thru the safari or cliff cave too. I used misdreavus-> msimagius on both my HG and SS runs. 

Not a distribution problem, but Extrasensory on the egg Togepi makes Togetic much more viable as a pokemon. Maybe makes Morty and Chuck too easy but was a very welcome change
Yeah I used to think Togepi was a gen 1 Pokémon because of the show.
    Kinda was, Togepi, Ho-oh, Marill and a few others were cut from R/B due to tech limitiations
Forgetting Slugma is forgivable. You can’t even get it until late into postgame and it isn’t great. Houndour at least has a really cool design and was a fancy new Dark-type
I actually though Medicham was a Gen IV Pokemon because it was so common in Sinnoh
TIL Slugma is Gen 2.
it was the reverse for me. as a kid i was absolutely positive volbeat and illumise were gen 2
    Cause of Camp Pikachu? It was a Gen 2 movie.
Hell I just learned that chimecho isn't gen 4
    Well I can’t blame you, it’s chingling that’s gen 4 right?
        Okay, that’s one I actually didn’t know. 

So... why did Gen 4 decide Chimecho needed a pre-evo?
            Gen 4 gave us multiple pre evolutions for pretty much no reason. Chingling, Happiny, Bonsly, Munchlax, and Mantyke.

Some other Pokémon that needed evos pretty desperately got them too, at least.
i always thought slugma was gen 3 too
I always thought macargo, slugma, and skarmory were gen 3 too.
Those were all pretty hard to obtain in GSC as well. I like to believe that Pokémon like Slugma are actually native to Hoenn and only migrated to Kanto a few years after RBY.
My first pokemon game was colloseum (weird i know)  so all gen 2&3 pokemon are the same gen to me
CORSOLA AND PHANPHY ARE GEN 2!?
Corsola blew my mind as a kid when i found out they were gen 2 and skarmory
I had no idea slugma and skarmory were gen 2 Pokémon
Same but leaf green to ruby, I still have to remind myself about Skarmory being gen 2 occasionally.
A lot of people think Skarmory is Gen 3. I know it was gen 2 because of the anime but I don't remember ever seeing the Pokemon in the game.
Same. FR was my first fame then I jumped into Emerald. I was so confused at how many gen 3 pokes were actually gen 2
Skarmory always felt like a gen 3 pokemon, just something about its design just shouted Hoenn.
As someone who played gen 4 first, I was sure all the pokemon I found were introduced in that gen. I was very surprised to learn that common things like Tentacool, Ponyta and Psyduck were actually older than me when I got the national dex.
I do think that some of the Kanto and Hoenn pokemon are from Sinnoh. But my headcanon was Snorlax not Roselia-thats why we see 2 snorlax in Kanto but Mumchlax are all over Sinnoh.
Gen III did have FR/LG as enhanced remakes of Gen I.
True, but I believe the grunt “model” that does appear frequently in game only counts for one in this chart.
    Each unique grunt trainer is accounted for. I think Poochyena feels more common because it's in so many required battles.
Right, no one used that thing, presumably because someone might not be able to battle it
    Imagine Phoebe using one and ending your run with it
        [deleted]
            So what is the deal, can this pokemon be killed by super effective moves or is it only damaged by critical hits?
                Super effective moves only.
                Only by supereffective moves. Since it's bug/ghost, it can only be damaged by flying, rock, ghost, fire, or dark attacks, and since it's set at exactly 1 HP, any of the above is an automatic one-hit KO.
                Weather as well
                    And status effects like poison
                Super-effective moves only, but it also takes damage from stuff like hazards, weather, status, so it's a lot worse than it actually looks.
                    Would be really cool but I assumed flying, ghost, and fire moves are pretty common in competitive play right? Seems like a pokemon that has a really cool concept but not fully executed
                        I think giving it so many weaknesses was probably for balance purposes

It's exceptionally hard to balance a Pokemon like that
        In Colosseum this can happen to you.  On Mt. Battle, battle 99 has a Shedinja and can completely wall you right before the end.
            On the one hand, that's evil and I love it.

On the other hand, if you got up to level 99 on Mt. Battle, you probably have *something* to hit a Bug/Ghost type for super effective damage, or failing that, something with Will-o-Wisp/Toxic/Sand Stream/etc.
                Mt. Battle is not difficult, just time consuming. You don't need status moves to get through it. I completed it with my kid strategy of only attack moves on all Pokémon. And unlike things like Battle Tower, legendaries are allowed on Mt. Battle.

So yeah, with that kid strategy, there's a big possibility to hit fight 99 and have no counter to Shedinja.
There aren't even any fully evolved starters as the rival still uses Grovyle/Combusken/Marshtomb in the final battle against them.
    When I was a kid I always found it odd that you basically intimidate your best friend into retirement from battling at the age of 10.
        I think this happens to Hop too pretty much.  Or you bully him into no longer trying to be the best.
            Perhaps he shouldn’t suck so hard then, at least hau put up a bit of a fight with that fucking riachu of his
                The last strong rival was Blue.
                    Barry is actually pretty strong, silver is no joke either
                Regular SM Hau with his Komala was pretty sucky, but **Ultra** SM Hau with Noivern/Tauros was a lot more of a contender.
            He still battles (and if you have Shield, his final fight where he has Zacian is a pain in the ass) but he stops obsessing over becoming champion.
    Iirc they were even above the level they would need to be at to evolve? Might be misremembering tho.
Yeah, Nincada at 5. Ninjask at 12.

Shedinja at no.
I could be misremembering but I believe you can find a single trainer with Shedinja on the route after Meteor Falls (between Meteor Falls and the first gym city). I believe you need surf so if I'm right it makes sense that many people didn't come across it.

Edit : Never mind I am apparently misremembering it with Ninjask. Either that or I met one in a randomizer there (looked up on Serebii's PokeEarth).
F, Iirc, Driftloon is not even the only one, the only trainer to use Haunter is also in her Gym
    You could trade a medicham to that piece of shit Mindy in Snowpoint to register a haunter though
Not sure about Platinum, but I've been playing quite a lot of Diamond and Pearl lately that I pretty much know what trainer to fight to see which Pokémon
Branden uses both the Regi Trio and the Bird Trio depending on challenge
Frontier Brains are in the list but have entirely the wrong data. They're listed as having a single lvl 5 Beldum each and that's it. My bad for not realising.
No. The trainers at the frontier aren't true NPCs are their teams are generated through hard code rather than a data file. That said, the Frontier Brains are a weird case where their teams are incorrectly listed as having a single lvl 5 Beldum each.
    Interesting, thank you for all this information
enough to give hoenn a 7/10
    thatsthejoke.gif
Yeah, it's interesting how weirdly distributed some of them are, haha.
If I remember correctly every Ace Trainer in Victory Road had at least 1 Hariyama.
It's just that we see Peliper a lot besides NPC, it has us kinda conditioned to think that. And Wingulls.
Yes you can re-battle the gym leaders... you didn't know ?
THANK YOU  
Someone read the review and understands the problem is the amount of water type POKEMON. It sucks that water pokemon are all water types but land pokemon are divided into everything else
    I always urge people to actually read that review. I'm just sayin', a good number of people who meme on it only read the bullet point next to the final score, not even the small synopsis at the bottom which serves as a better summary of the complaint than "Too much water" ("Still, a few of its flaws are even more glaring in 3D, especially the excess water Pokémon and often dull navigation of their habitats.").

There's a reason IGN stopped doing the bullet points, even going so far as to retroactively remove them from the ORAS review. And it's because the majority of folks online won't read any of the rest of the review if they're there.

The topic of that review always gets me heated.
        If the +/- summary at the end had more negative bullet points it wouldn’t be clowned as much. People were just mad that the reviewer gave the game a 7.8 score (which, hot take... is actually a totally fair score for ORAS) and wrote it off as dumb reasoning. 

Even then, “too much water” is a totally valid complaint for Hoenn. The last third of the game being mostly relatively boring water routes is bad game design, and a remake is exactly the place where you should fix it to make it more interesting and more balanced Pokemon distribution-wise.
            I mean to be fair when it comes to remakes, they never really drastically alter routes and what Pokémon are found on them. Kinda like how half the johto Pokémon are still literally nonexistent in the johto games.
        Honestly it’s just really funny to me. Like, that’s literally the only negative bullet point. You’re definitely right, the review makes plenty of very valid points and justifies its stance very well, but that doesn’t stop “7.8/10 too much water” from being funny. It’s both funny and valid.
    This so much. The problem with Hoenn wasn't "too much water", it was "too bland water". Every ocean tile is the same and their encounter tables only contain two Pokémon families, unless you stop to fish or dive. Hoenn had this massive "land vs. sea" thing built up, but executed it so poorly in that all the sea routes combined had less variety than any single land route. The sea isn't inherently bland, as illustrated by, for instance, *Finding Nemo* or in later years, *Subnautica*. The ocean should be teeming with diverse life and contain several different biomes, but instead it's portrayed as a vast, bland expanse of sameyness. Where are the coral reefs, the sand banks, the kelp forests, the outlets of rivers, the harbours, the industrial pollution if they want to be environmental? OK, maybe it wouldn't have been possible on the GBA, but ORAS could definitely have picked up the slack there. Or at least Gen VII, but alas ...
        What the review pointed out was a balancing issue, too many water type Pokémon would make electric types like manectric way too overleved.

This was never about Hoenn's water routes being bland
    Water is the most commun type, even more than normal.
    Later generations introduced more aquatic Pokémon that aren’t water type.
    Just give me ONE fucking fire type! That's all I ask for. If you don't pick Chimchar you don't have a fire type until after the Pokemon League

Edit: I got gen 3 and 4 mixed up...
        chimchar? 🤔
            Oh yeah I totally got gen 3 and 4 mixed up haha. Oops!
        You're thinking of Gen 4. Chimchar is Gen 4, not Gen 3.

Gen 3 had Camerupt, Torkoal, Magcargo, Ninetales, that's a fairly large selection of Fire types.

Gen 4 was the one where you basically were stuck with Ponyta or Flareon.
            Yeah my bad!
            Just Ponyta in Diamond and Pearl until after you beat Cynthia.
    Well fans complain endlessly when aquatic Pokémon aren’t water type.
Gen III actually has a much worse encounter rate for water routes. They actually fixed it by toning it down in the remakes.
Yeah, often when people say "too much water" it's in the sense that all water tiles are encounter tiles. It's be like if every land based route was 100% covered in tall grass. It becomes a tedious slog. Doubly so when there's barely any variance in the pokemon you're seeing.
And 7.
Or in Gen 4, where it's basically the only grass type since the rest are bad and/or annoying to get
    i guess thats how I ended up using it and it becoming my fave pokemon lol
Yeah that's totally true but it's not the same, you know? I always longed to have Roselia in my team in Emerald so that now it just feels wrong to have it outside Gen 3 lol. Maybe when I play again I'll try having it in my team
I mean he should be number 1... Fucker was everywhere
understandable have a good day
Skarmory was one of my core team in GSC, always made sure to get him as soon as I reached Blackthorn.

I had no idea Slugma/Magcargo were introduced in Gen 2. Apparently they were rare and only appeared on the Kanto Cycling Road!
    That was always one of my main grievances with Gen 2/the remakes, that loads of the cool Johto Pokémon couldn't be caught in Johto!
        Exactly! I hated that houndour couldn’t be encountered until way late into the Kanto postgame. A fire dark hell hound? Cmon, who doesn’t want that on their team?
            Gen 2 and 4 made the mistake of making the new pokémon really hard to catch.
                I vividly remember the Alola games having a similar issue too.
            Yeah. They introduced a new type then only made one Pokemon of that type (Umbreon) available before postgame.

Whereas every Steel type was conceivably available before the E4 (aside from Skarmory being version exclusive).
                I think you could get Tyranitar before E4 too.
                    And sneasel
                    Only in the remakes yeah.
                        Nope, never played the remakes.
                And Murkrow? Or is it only available in the remakes?
                And Murkrow? Or is it only available in the remakes?
                    Yeah sorry I meant in the OGs
                        Oh ok, I've only played HG where you can find Murkrows in the safari zone. They should have put some Houndours there too, now that I think about it.
            Why i hate gen 2
                I hear you, but I can’t say I hate gen2 for that. 

It’s probably all nostalgia at this point but young me going from yellow with its mono coloring to silver with all the colors and new Pokémon? It just felt so different and special and magical for me. Nothing will beat me discovering chinchou and being amazed at an electric/water type. And the mysticism of the roaming legendary beasts? Man, I loved that stuff as a kid 

It’s definitely flawed, I’ve seen that on replays (which is why I think that the remakes are some of the best Pokémon games made since there’s so much improvement on those flaws) but I just still look back so fondly on gen2
                    Pokemon Gold was my first Pokemon game and I still will say gen 2 is thrash.
                    Even the remakes are mediocre, since unless you have trades or randomizers (which most people don't) you are stuck with gen 1 and 2 Pokémon
            I was more annoyed that it wasn't still there in FRLG. I'd been hoping to use one against Sabrina.
        You didn’t miss much with Magcargo. Trust me.
            What?! You aint doing my exotic lunch item that way. Its a tonky fire type that learns some decent stab pretty early. It doesnt hold up well in competitive, but it is not bad in-game. (Or at least thats what i remember from my hgss nuzlocke lol)
                Magcargo is one of the most flawed Pokemon in history. As the proud owner of the shiny KJ Hamler Magcargo, it makes me sad, but such is the reality.

-	4x weakness to Ground
-	4x weakness to Water
-	weakness to Rock, and by extension, a Stealth Rock weakness
-	Ridiculously slow
-	Terrible attack stat
-	Mediocre special attack
-	Mediocre special bulk
-	Lacking Rock STAB options
-	Weak Explosion
-	Lacking options to power itself up
                    Good incubator tho. I had one in Emerald.
        Same it’s so lame.
        It does totally suck, but it's mainly because the Gen II Pokemon weren't supposed to be "Johto Pokemon" so much as simply "newly discovered Pokemon". The problem is that by Gen III, they realized it wasn't realistic or logical for 100+ Pokemon to be "newly discovered" in every single game, so they changed the narrative to instead be that the "new Pokemon" hadn't been around before because they were native to the new region(s) — which left Johto in an awkward spot in retrospect.
    On that note, can we talk about how rubbish it is that there were Gen 2 Pokemon that only appeared in Kanto?
        Or Sneasel that wasn't available until My. Silver. Before HGSS, you couldn't get Larvitar until then either, but as of HGSS you can get Larvitar as early as the 6th gym I believe, with the safari zone
            You can get Sneasel on Ice Path at night on Crystal but it's extremely rare
                And you can bet your butt my dumb self sat in that area until I found one too after learning that tidbit. For a frost weasel/wolverine demon thing? Heck yeah!
                    They really did Sneasel dirty with that typing pre-gen 4 though... my guy is barely usable until the split
                    I did the same thing but it took me way too much time to understand that it only appears on the bottom floor. 9 year old me lost endless hours of pointless searching on the top floor just to meet Swinubs and Golbats.
            Before the 5th gym, if you go out of your way for it, I believe.
        Yeah honestly it’s the reason why I can’t ever say Gen 2 is my favorite. The Pokémon distribution is terrible.
            The post game was fantastic though. Felt like a whole new adventure. Wish all Pokémon games had a postgame like that
                I hope the new generations will take the dlc (or have a better one in the main game) route and have great post game stuff
        Gen 2 suuuuucked
            I feel it's a bit harsh to say it sucked, considering how many improvements it made over the original games, but not every shot it took landed, that's for sure.
                It didn't improve the original. It had color and fixed some bugs. But the Pokémon and most mechanics introduced were awful
                    Let's go over a few things you missed

* Added two new types, which helped balance the type chart which was heavily skewed in favor of some types, notably Psychic.

* Split the special stat, making it less abusable than it was in Gen 1

* Held items, which was such a huge game changer that there are Pokemon in today's current meta who couldn't function at all without that addition.

* Added a clock system with different encounters, both with Pokemon and as in-game events, at different times depending on when you did them.

* Breeding, the thing that lets you get a Pokemon with better or even perfect IVs without having to catch hundreds of the same species.

* Shiny forms, just as a fun little trophy to say "I made an effort to seek out this Pokemon and got a reward."

* Improved graphics, which goes far beyond just "having color" as you said. There was more detail, more variety in sprites, and Crystal even gave us animated Pokemon.

* Rebattling trainers, something which was previously limited to the Pokemon League. You could even rematch gym leaders, which was impossible before.

* Trainers actually had names instead of just a title

* Apricorns

* The Pokegear

I could go on, if you like.
                        2 new types that were awful in gen 2
Held items that were all awful in gen 2
Clock system that is completely pointless in gen 2
Breeding, which is completely pointless in gen 2 due to lack of natures
Shinier that have less than a 1 in 8000 chance of showing up
Imporved graphics that do not hold up at all
Rebattling trainers was done infinitely better with the vs seeker as you could actually use it instead of waiting for a call
Pokegear which was a useless gimmick
Apricots that you could only get once a day
Want me to keep going?
                    Gen 2 is basically just everything they couldn’t fit into Gen 1, and it kinda shows.
                        Yeah..... that game doesn't hold up. At all
            You sucked. Johto is the **best**, fite me!
                Sure. Why are most johto Pokémon unattainable? All the good one require trade, transfer, or access to the post game.
        My gripe is that one tiny patch of grass in route 35 with a 1 percent chance of yanma. I’ve been keeping count on a play through and I’m at 167 encounters without seeing one, wounded
    Haha yeah. There's an NPC that tells you about slugma being there.
    I love skarmory but i miss its old idle stance. In pokemon stadium and the sprite based games it looked great. Post XY it's "airplane" stance looks so terrible to the point its almost comedy.
    Which makes them kanto Pokémon
    Houndour wasn’t until the cycling road in gen 2 either. Like wtf houndour is definitely not found only in Kanto
    This is the problem I have with Gen 2. Why introduce new Pokémon only to lock them behind postgame? 

Another issue I have is that most of the gym leaders are using Gen 1 Pokémon! As their aces too. Why the fuck couldn’t Morty use the only representative of the type from that generation on his team?
        I think it’s because gold and silver weren’t designed to be “the next generation” of Pokémon games, they were designed to be THE definitive final pokemon games. A ton of the decisions/flaws make more sense when you consider that the series was never supposed to go beyond crystal.
            Okay I see your point, but why couldn’t they rectify this in HGSS at the very least?
In fairness, Skarmory was Silver exclusive, so it's possible you missed it entirely.
Yup! I have to do a double take every time I think about what gen they are from, I've always felt like gen 2 is kind of like a weird "dlc" of gen 1, like it doesn't quite fit as a standalone, and takes aspects that would have been part of kanto and hoenn and mashes them together in the middle.
    As a trainer that got started in Johto I strongly disagree with you, but as someone that skipped two and played 1 & 3, I can see how you got there.
    no way, the second generation added so much; held items, a completely new region with like 100+ new pokemon, new evolution lines for kanto pokemon, berry crafting, tons of the different ball types, the sp def stat (no longer based off sp like in gen 1), breeding, several awesome legendaries and dungeons, and even added kanto as a part of it. 


Silver and Gold (and Crytal but never played that one) were probably the biggest jump in content from one gen to the next in terms of touching **everything**, definitely the one that had the most intros of core features (breeding and held items are a **huge** part of the meta).
        The first 4 gens all had pretty significant jumps, it was only after Sinnoh that things kind of slowed down.
            Well, Black and White introduced Hidden Abilities which really helped certain Pokemon a lot by giving them new uses in battle. X and Y gave us Fairy-types. After *that* yeah, things slowed down.
        Don't forget two new, important types!
        Of those, only the special split and held items really seem like things that wouldn't be slotted in DLC. Even new types feel like it'd be something you could add in DLC for a series with only 1 game.

Heck, of the 100 (why did you say 100+, there were literally 99+celebi?), many of them were already conceptualized for gen 1 but didn't make the initial cut.
            breeding is completely novel, introduced eggs and baby pokemon. Those are gigantic DLC asks imo
                Yeah but it's not something unheard of. I guess it's more an expansion than a conventional DLC, but yeah, adding mechanics of that size isn't that unheard of in an expansion.
    To be fair it kinda was. A lot of the 100 were planned pokemon for gen 1 that they didn't have time/space to slot into the OG game.
For real! Blows my mind lol
Lol I'm also shocked. I really believed they were gen 3
I confuse those 2 for gen 3 pokemon too! I wonder if they're just that more common?
    A lot of Gen 2 Pokemon were really hard to find - Skarmory for example is very rare in one location in one game in Gen 2.  A bunch of cool Gen 2 Pokemon like Slugma, Houndour, Misdreavus, Murkrow, etc. weren't available to be caught until the post-game while being relatively accessible in Gen 3.
Corsola is also gen 2
Oh shit I had pokemon gold... Apparently it was only natural in Silver and Emerald. But then I also had 245 pokemon in Gold (until a little prick wiped my fucking save the piece of shit). I always assumed Skarmory was gen 3... I used to catch him up on that ashy volcano area where you collect soot for pokeflutes.
In fairness, while Slugma was Gen 2, it was also only in Kanto, and if I recall, was only on the cycle path (routes 16, 17, 18). Probably easy to miss.
SkarmBliss was even one of the most dominant forces in the gen 2 metagame if I'm not very mistaken.
If you plaued Gold you would never see a Skarmory since no trainers use it and its version exclusive.
Holy crap the Slugma bomb literally blew my mind lol
Apparently it can be caught using the good rod in the exact same place you get it (Olivine City). I'll admit though, I don't remember Corsola in gen 2 myself. Maybe it's another one of those Pokemon that NPC's don't really use.
Id add chinchou to the list since we go visit underwater locations in RSE.

OTOH tho RSE is more focused on the environment and nature, whereas GSC is the conflict between traditions and modernism (where Kanto is the modern region and Johto more traditional). So I guess it makes sense, but ut doesn't ignore that Johto has the worst distribution of new pokemon of every region. And I feel like every route has the same wild pokemon whereas RSE and DPP it was always unique
This one always blows my mind as well. There's a cave you can find it in post-Johto.
    Yeah weirdly Slugma and Houndour are found in Kanto.
        And murkrow, and larvitar, and misdreavus, and half of the trade evolution items
            Johto is the region with the least amount of Johto pokémon.
            In HGSS you can get Larvitar pretty early via the Safari Zone. I used Tyranitar on my last playthrough
                HGSS fixes a lot of tye distribution problems between the safari, walker, and other features. I also feel as though Cliff Cave and the safari helped fix the leveling too. Like just a bit more for people to do before the late Johto game.

Misdreavus and murkrow are available thru the safari or cliff cave too. I used misdreavus-> msimagius on both my HG and SS runs. 

Not a distribution problem, but Extrasensory on the egg Togepi makes Togetic much more viable as a pokemon. Maybe makes Morty and Chuck too easy but was a very welcome change
Kinda was, Togepi, Ho-oh, Marill and a few others were cut from R/B due to tech limitiations
Cause of Camp Pikachu? It was a Gen 2 movie.
Well I can’t blame you, it’s chingling that’s gen 4 right?
    Okay, that’s one I actually didn’t know. 

So... why did Gen 4 decide Chimecho needed a pre-evo?
        Gen 4 gave us multiple pre evolutions for pretty much no reason. Chingling, Happiny, Bonsly, Munchlax, and Mantyke.

Some other Pokémon that needed evos pretty desperately got them too, at least.
Each unique grunt trainer is accounted for. I think Poochyena feels more common because it's in so many required battles.
Imagine Phoebe using one and ending your run with it

        So what is the deal, can this pokemon be killed by super effective moves or is it only damaged by critical hits?
            Super effective moves only.
            Only by supereffective moves. Since it's bug/ghost, it can only be damaged by flying, rock, ghost, fire, or dark attacks, and since it's set at exactly 1 HP, any of the above is an automatic one-hit KO.
            Weather as well
                And status effects like poison
            Super-effective moves only, but it also takes damage from stuff like hazards, weather, status, so it's a lot worse than it actually looks.
                Would be really cool but I assumed flying, ghost, and fire moves are pretty common in competitive play right? Seems like a pokemon that has a really cool concept but not fully executed
                    I think giving it so many weaknesses was probably for balance purposes

It's exceptionally hard to balance a Pokemon like that
    In Colosseum this can happen to you.  On Mt. Battle, battle 99 has a Shedinja and can completely wall you right before the end.
        On the one hand, that's evil and I love it.

On the other hand, if you got up to level 99 on Mt. Battle, you probably have *something* to hit a Bug/Ghost type for super effective damage, or failing that, something with Will-o-Wisp/Toxic/Sand Stream/etc.
            Mt. Battle is not difficult, just time consuming. You don't need status moves to get through it. I completed it with my kid strategy of only attack moves on all Pokémon. And unlike things like Battle Tower, legendaries are allowed on Mt. Battle.

So yeah, with that kid strategy, there's a big possibility to hit fight 99 and have no counter to Shedinja.
When I was a kid I always found it odd that you basically intimidate your best friend into retirement from battling at the age of 10.
    I think this happens to Hop too pretty much.  Or you bully him into no longer trying to be the best.
        Perhaps he shouldn’t suck so hard then, at least hau put up a bit of a fight with that fucking riachu of his
            The last strong rival was Blue.
                Barry is actually pretty strong, silver is no joke either
            Regular SM Hau with his Komala was pretty sucky, but **Ultra** SM Hau with Noivern/Tauros was a lot more of a contender.
        He still battles (and if you have Shield, his final fight where he has Zacian is a pain in the ass) but he stops obsessing over becoming champion.
Iirc they were even above the level they would need to be at to evolve? Might be misremembering tho.
You could trade a medicham to that piece of shit Mindy in Snowpoint to register a haunter though
Interesting, thank you for all this information

I always urge people to actually read that review. I'm just sayin', a good number of people who meme on it only read the bullet point next to the final score, not even the small synopsis at the bottom which serves as a better summary of the complaint than "Too much water" ("Still, a few of its flaws are even more glaring in 3D, especially the excess water Pokémon and often dull navigation of their habitats.").

There's a reason IGN stopped doing the bullet points, even going so far as to retroactively remove them from the ORAS review. And it's because the majority of folks online won't read any of the rest of the review if they're there.

The topic of that review always gets me heated.
    If the +/- summary at the end had more negative bullet points it wouldn’t be clowned as much. People were just mad that the reviewer gave the game a 7.8 score (which, hot take... is actually a totally fair score for ORAS) and wrote it off as dumb reasoning. 

Even then, “too much water” is a totally valid complaint for Hoenn. The last third of the game being mostly relatively boring water routes is bad game design, and a remake is exactly the place where you should fix it to make it more interesting and more balanced Pokemon distribution-wise.
        I mean to be fair when it comes to remakes, they never really drastically alter routes and what Pokémon are found on them. Kinda like how half the johto Pokémon are still literally nonexistent in the johto games.
    Honestly it’s just really funny to me. Like, that’s literally the only negative bullet point. You’re definitely right, the review makes plenty of very valid points and justifies its stance very well, but that doesn’t stop “7.8/10 too much water” from being funny. It’s both funny and valid.
This so much. The problem with Hoenn wasn't "too much water", it was "too bland water". Every ocean tile is the same and their encounter tables only contain two Pokémon families, unless you stop to fish or dive. Hoenn had this massive "land vs. sea" thing built up, but executed it so poorly in that all the sea routes combined had less variety than any single land route. The sea isn't inherently bland, as illustrated by, for instance, *Finding Nemo* or in later years, *Subnautica*. The ocean should be teeming with diverse life and contain several different biomes, but instead it's portrayed as a vast, bland expanse of sameyness. Where are the coral reefs, the sand banks, the kelp forests, the outlets of rivers, the harbours, the industrial pollution if they want to be environmental? OK, maybe it wouldn't have been possible on the GBA, but ORAS could definitely have picked up the slack there. Or at least Gen VII, but alas ...
    What the review pointed out was a balancing issue, too many water type Pokémon would make electric types like manectric way too overleved.

This was never about Hoenn's water routes being bland
Water is the most commun type, even more than normal.
Later generations introduced more aquatic Pokémon that aren’t water type.
Just give me ONE fucking fire type! That's all I ask for. If you don't pick Chimchar you don't have a fire type until after the Pokemon League

Edit: I got gen 3 and 4 mixed up...
    chimchar? 🤔
        Oh yeah I totally got gen 3 and 4 mixed up haha. Oops!
    You're thinking of Gen 4. Chimchar is Gen 4, not Gen 3.

Gen 3 had Camerupt, Torkoal, Magcargo, Ninetales, that's a fairly large selection of Fire types.

Gen 4 was the one where you basically were stuck with Ponyta or Flareon.
        Yeah my bad!
        Just Ponyta in Diamond and Pearl until after you beat Cynthia.
Well fans complain endlessly when aquatic Pokémon aren’t water type.
i guess thats how I ended up using it and it becoming my fave pokemon lol
That was always one of my main grievances with Gen 2/the remakes, that loads of the cool Johto Pokémon couldn't be caught in Johto!
    Exactly! I hated that houndour couldn’t be encountered until way late into the Kanto postgame. A fire dark hell hound? Cmon, who doesn’t want that on their team?
        Gen 2 and 4 made the mistake of making the new pokémon really hard to catch.
            I vividly remember the Alola games having a similar issue too.
        Yeah. They introduced a new type then only made one Pokemon of that type (Umbreon) available before postgame.

Whereas every Steel type was conceivably available before the E4 (aside from Skarmory being version exclusive).
            I think you could get Tyranitar before E4 too.
                And sneasel
                Only in the remakes yeah.
                    Nope, never played the remakes.
            And Murkrow? Or is it only available in the remakes?
            And Murkrow? Or is it only available in the remakes?
                Yeah sorry I meant in the OGs
                    Oh ok, I've only played HG where you can find Murkrows in the safari zone. They should have put some Houndours there too, now that I think about it.
        Why i hate gen 2
            I hear you, but I can’t say I hate gen2 for that. 

It’s probably all nostalgia at this point but young me going from yellow with its mono coloring to silver with all the colors and new Pokémon?

    I think it’s because gold and silver weren’t designed to be “the next generation” of Pokémon games, they were designed to be THE definitive final pokemon games. A ton of the decisions/flaws make more sense when you consider that the series was never supposed to go beyond crystal.
        Okay I see your point, but why couldn’t they rectify this in HGSS at the very least?
As a trainer that got started in Johto I strongly disagree with you, but as someone that skipped two and played 1 & 3, I can see how you got there.
no way, the second generation added so much; held items, a completely new region with like 100+ new pokemon, new evolution lines for kanto pokemon, berry crafting, tons of the different ball types, the sp def stat (no longer based off sp like in gen 1), breeding, several awesome legendaries and dungeons, and even added kanto as a part of it. 


Silver and Gold (and Crytal but never played that one) were probably the biggest jump in content from one gen to the next in terms of touching **everything**, definitely the one that had the most intros of core features (breeding and held items are a **huge** part of the meta).
    The first 4 gens all had pretty significant jumps, it was only after Sinnoh that things kind of slowed down.
        Well, Black and White introduced Hidden Abilities which really helped certain Pokemon a lot by giving them new uses in battle. X and Y gave us Fairy-types. After *that* yeah, things slowed down.
    Don't forget two new, important types!
    Of those, only the special split and held items really seem like things that wouldn't be slotted in DLC. Even new types feel like it'd be something you could add in DLC for a series with only 1 game.

Heck, of the 100 (why did you say 100+, there were literally 99+celebi?), many of them were already conceptualized for gen 1 but didn't make the initial cut.
        breeding is completely novel, introduced eggs and baby pokemon. Those are gigantic DLC asks imo
            Yeah but it's not something unheard of. I guess it's more an expansion than a conventional DLC, but yeah, adding mechanics of that size isn't that unheard of in an expansion.
To be fair it kinda was. A lot of the 100 were planned pokemon for gen 1 that they didn't have time/space to slot into the OG game.
A lot of Gen 2 Pokemon were really hard to find - Skarmory for example is very rare in one location in one game in Gen 2.  A bunch of cool Gen 2 Pokemon like Slugma, Houndour, Misdreavus, Murkrow, etc. weren't available to be caught until the post-game while being relatively accessible in Gen 3.
Yeah weirdly Slugma and Houndour are found in Kanto.
    And murkrow, and larvitar, and misdreavus, and half of the trade evolution items
        Johto is the region with the least amount of Johto pokémon.
        In HGSS you can get Larvitar pretty early via the Safari Zone. I used Tyranitar on my last playthrough
            HGSS fixes a lot of tye distribution problems between the safari, walker, and other features. I also feel as though Cliff Cave and the safari helped fix the leveling too. Like just a bit more for people to do before the late Johto game.

Misdreavus and murkrow are available thru the safari or cliff cave too. I used misdreavus-> msimagius on both my HG and SS runs. 

Not a distribution problem, but Extrasensory on the egg Togepi makes Togetic much more viable as a pokemon. Maybe makes Morty and Chuck too easy but was a very welcome change
Okay, that’s one I actually didn’t know. 

So... why did Gen 4 decide Chimecho needed a pre-evo?
    Gen 4 gave us multiple pre evolutions for pretty much no reason. Chingling, Happiny, Bonsly, Munchlax, and Mantyke.

Some other Pokémon that needed evos pretty desperately got them too, at least.

    So what is the deal, can this pokemon be killed by super effective moves or is it only damaged by critical hits?
        Super effective moves only.
        Only by supereffective moves. Since it's bug/ghost, it can only be damaged by flying, rock, ghost, fire, or dark attacks, and since it's set at exactly 1 HP, any of the above is an automatic one-hit KO.
        Weather as well
            And status effects like poison
        Super-effective moves only, but it also takes damage from stuff like hazards, weather, status, so it's a lot worse than it actually looks.
            Would be really cool but I assumed flying, ghost, and fire moves are pretty common in competitive play right? Seems like a pokemon that has a really cool concept but not fully executed
                I think giving it so many weaknesses was probably for balance purposes

It's exceptionally hard to balance a Pokemon like that
In Colosseum this can happen to you.  On Mt. Battle, battle 99 has a Shedinja and can completely wall you right before the end.
    On the one hand, that's evil and I love it.

On the other hand, if you got up to level 99 on Mt. Battle, you probably have *something* to hit a Bug/Ghost type for super effective damage, or failing that, something with Will-o-Wisp/Toxic/Sand Stream/etc.
        Mt. Battle is not difficult, just time consuming. You don't need status moves to get through it. I completed it with my kid strategy of only attack moves on all Pokémon. And unlike things like Battle Tower, legendaries are allowed on Mt. Battle.

So yeah, with that kid strategy, there's a big possibility to hit fight 99 and have no counter to Shedinja.
I think this happens to Hop too pretty much.  Or you bully him into no longer trying to be the best.
    Perhaps he shouldn’t suck so hard then, at least hau put up a bit of a fight with that fucking riachu of his
        The last strong rival was Blue.
            Barry is actually pretty strong, silver is no joke either
        Regular SM Hau with his Komala was pretty sucky, but **Ultra** SM Hau with Noivern/Tauros was a lot more of a contender.
    He still battles (and if you have Shield, his final fight where he has Zacian is a pain in the ass) but he stops obsessing over becoming champion.
If the +/- summary at the end had more negative bullet points it wouldn’t be clowned as much. People were just mad that the reviewer gave the game a 7.8 score (which, hot take... is actually a totally fair score for ORAS) and wrote it off as dumb reasoning. 

Even then, “too much water” is a totally valid complaint for Hoenn. The last third of the game being mostly relatively boring water routes is bad game design, and a remake is exactly the place where you should fix it to make it more interesting and more balanced Pokemon distribution-wise.
    I mean to be fair when it comes to remakes, they never really drastically alter routes and what Pokémon are found on them. Kinda like how half the johto Pokémon are still literally nonexistent in the johto games.
Honestly it’s just really funny to me. Like, that’s literally the only negative bullet point. You’re definitely right, the review makes plenty of very valid points and justifies its stance very well, but that doesn’t stop “7.8/10 too much water” from being funny. It’s both funny and valid.
What the review pointed out was a balancing issue, too many water type Pokémon would make electric types like manectric way too overleved.

This was never about Hoenn's water routes being bland
chimchar? 🤔
    Oh yeah I totally got gen 3 and 4 mixed up haha. Oops!
You're thinking of Gen 4. Chimchar is Gen 4, not Gen 3.

Gen 3 had Camerupt, Torkoal, Magcargo, Ninetales, that's a fairly large selection of Fire types.

Gen 4 was the one where you basically were stuck with Ponyta or Flareon.
    Yeah my bad!
    Just Ponyta in Diamond and Pearl until after you beat Cynthia.
Exactly! I hated that houndour couldn’t be encountered until way late into the Kanto postgame. A fire dark hell hound? Cmon, who doesn’t want that on their team?
    Gen 2 and 4 made the mistake of making the new pokémon really hard to catch.
        I vividly remember the Alola games having a similar issue too.
    Yeah. They introduced a new type then only made one Pokemon of that type (Umbreon) available before postgame.

Whereas every Steel type was conceivably available before the E4 (aside from Skarmory being version exclusive).
        I think you could get Tyranitar before E4 too.
            And sneasel
            Only in the remakes yeah.
                Nope, never played the remakes.
        And Murkrow? Or is it only available in the remakes?
        And Murkrow? Or is it only available in the remakes?
            Yeah sorry I meant in the OGs
                Oh ok, I've only played HG where you can find Murkrows in the safari zone. They should have put some Houndours there too, now that I think about it.
    Why i hate gen 2
        I hear you, but I can’t say I hate gen2 for that. 

It’s probably all nostalgia at this point but young me going from yellow with its mono coloring to silver with all the colors and new Pokémon? It just felt so different and special and magical for me. Nothing will beat me discovering chinchou and being amazed at an electric/water type. And the mysticism of the roaming legendary beasts? Man, I loved that stuff as a kid 

It’s definitely flawed, I’ve seen that on replays (which is why I think that the remakes are some of the best Pokémon games made since there’s so much improvement on those flaws) but I just still look back so fondly on gen2
            Pokemon Gold was my first Pokemon game and I still will say gen 2 is thrash.
            Even the remakes are mediocre, since unless you have trades or randomizers (which most people don't) you are stuck with gen 1 and 2 Pokémon
    I was more annoyed that it wasn't still there in FRLG. I'd been hoping to use one against Sabrina.
You didn’t miss much with Magcargo. Trust me.
    What?! You aint doing my exotic lunch item that way. Its a tonky fire type that learns some decent stab pretty early. It doesnt hold up well in competitive, but it is not bad in-game. (Or at least thats what i remember from my hgss nuzlocke lol)
        Magcargo is one of the most flawed Pokemon in history. As the proud owner of the shiny KJ Hamler Magcargo, it makes me sad, but such is the reality.

-	4x weakness to Ground
-	4x weakness to Water
-	weakness to Rock, and by extension, a Stealth Rock weakness
-	Ridiculously slow
-	Terrible attack stat
-	Mediocre special attack
-	Mediocre special bulk
-	Lacking Rock STAB options
-	Weak Explosion
-	Lacking options to power itself up
            Good incubator tho. I had one in Emerald.
Same it’s so lame.
It does totally suck, but it's mainly because the Gen II Pokemon weren't supposed to be "Johto Pokemon" so much as simply "newly discovered Pokemon". The problem is that by Gen III, they realized it wasn't realistic or logical for 100+ Pokemon to be "newly discovered" in every single game, so they changed the narrative to instead be that the "new Pokemon" hadn't been around before because they were native to the new region(s) — which left Johto in an awkward spot in retrospect.
Or Sneasel that wasn't available until My. Silver. Before HGSS, you couldn't get Larvitar until then either, but as of HGSS you can get Larvitar as early as the 6th gym I believe, with the safari zone
    You can get Sneasel on Ice Path at night on Crystal but it's extremely rare
        And you can bet your butt my dumb self sat in that area until I found one too after learning that tidbit. For a frost weasel/wolverine demon thing? Heck yeah!
            They really did Sneasel dirty with that typing pre-gen 4 though... my guy is barely usable until the split
            I did the same thing but it took me way too much time to understand that it only appears on the bottom floor. 9 year old me lost endless hours of pointless searching on the top floor just to meet Swinubs and Golbats.
    Before the 5th gym, if you go out of your way for it, I believe.
Yeah honestly it’s the reason why I can’t ever say Gen 2 is my favorite. The Pokémon distribution is terrible.
    The post game was fantastic though. Felt like a whole new adventure. Wish all Pokémon games had a postgame like that
        I hope the new generations will take the dlc (or have a better one in the main game) route and have great post game stuff
Gen 2 suuuuucked
    I feel it's a bit harsh to say it sucked, considering how many improvements it made over the original games, but not every shot it took landed, that's for sure.
        It didn't improve the original. It had color and fixed some bugs. But the Pokémon and most mechanics introduced were awful
            Let's go over a few things you missed

* Added two new types, which helped balance the type chart which was heavily skewed in favor of some types, notably Psychic.

* Split the special stat, making it less abusable than it was in Gen 1

* Held items, which was such a huge game changer that there are Pokemon in today's current meta who couldn't function at all without that addition.

* Added a clock system with different encounters, both with Pokemon and as in-game events, at different times depending on when you did them.

* Breeding, the thing that lets you get a Pokemon with better or even perfect IVs without having to catch hundreds of the same species.

* Shiny forms, just as a fun little trophy to say "I made an effort to seek out this Pokemon and got a reward."

* Improved graphics, which goes far beyond just "having color" as you said. There was more detail, more variety in sprites, and Crystal even gave us animated Pokemon.

* Rebattling trainers, something which was previously limited to the Pokemon League. You could even rematch gym leaders, which was impossible before.

* Trainers actually had names instead of just a title

* Apricorns

* The Pokegear

I could go on, if you like.
                2 new types that were awful in gen 2
Held items that were all awful in gen 2
Clock system that is completely pointless in gen 2
Breeding, which is completely pointless in gen 2 due to lack of natures
Shinier that have less than a 1 in 8000 chance of showing up
Imporved graphics that do not hold up at all
Rebattling trainers was done infinitely better with the vs seeker as you could actually use it instead of waiting for a call
Pokegear which was a useless gimmick
Apricots that you could only get once a day
Want me to keep going?
            Gen 2 is basically just everything they couldn’t fit into Gen 1, and it kinda shows.
                Yeah..... that game doesn't hold up. At all
    You sucked. Johto is the **best**, fite me!
        Sure. Why are most johto Pokémon unattainable? All the good one require trade, transfer, or access to the post game.
My gripe is that one tiny patch of grass in route 35 with a 1 percent chance of yanma. I’ve been keeping count on a play through and I’m at 167 encounters without seeing one, wounded
I think it’s because gold and silver weren’t designed to be “the next generation” of Pokémon games, they were designed to be THE definitive final pokemon games. A ton of the decisions/flaws make more sense when you consider that the series was never supposed to go beyond crystal.

    Good incubator tho. I had one in Emerald.
And you can bet your butt my dumb self sat in that area until I found one too after learning that tidbit. For a frost weasel/wolverine demon thing? Heck yeah!
    They really did Sneasel dirty with that typing pre-gen 4 though... my guy is barely usable until the split
    I did the same thing but it took me way too much time to understand that it only appears on the bottom floor. 9 year old me lost endless hours of pointless searching on the top floor just to meet Swinubs and Golbats.
I hope the new generations will take the dlc (or have a better one in the main game) route and have great post game stuff
It didn't improve the original. It had color and fixed some bugs. But the Pokémon and most mechanics introduced were awful
    Let's go over a few things you missed

* Added two new types, which helped balance the type chart which was heavily skewed in favor of some types, notably Psychic.

* Split the special stat, making it less abusable than it was in Gen 1

* Held items, which was such a huge game changer that there are Pokemon in today's current meta who couldn't function at all without that addition.

* Added a clock system with different encounters, both with Pokemon and as in-game events, at different times depending on when you did them.

* Breeding, the thing that lets you get a Pokemon with better or even perfect IVs without having to catch hundreds of the same species.

* Shiny forms, just as a fun little trophy to say "I made an effort to seek out this Pokemon and got a reward."

* Improved graphics, which goes far beyond just "having color" as you said. There was more detail, more variety in sprites, and Crystal even gave us animated Pokemon.

* Rebattling trainers, something which was previously limited to the Pokemon League. You could even rematch gym leaders, which was impossible before.

* Trainers actually had names instead of just a title

* Apricorns

* The Pokegear

I could go on, if you like.
        2 new types that were awful in gen 2
Held items that were all awful in gen 2
Clock system that is completely pointless in gen 2
Breeding, which is completely pointless in gen 2 due to lack of natures
Shinier that have less than a 1 in 8000 chance of showing up
Imporved graphics that do not hold up at all
Rebattling trainers was done infinitely better with the vs seeker as you could actually use it instead of waiting for a call
Pokegear which was a useless gimmick
Apricots that you could only get once a day
Want me to keep going?
    Gen 2 is basically just everything they couldn’t fit into Gen 1, and it kinda shows.
        Yeah..... that game doesn't hold up. At all
Sure. Why are most johto Pokémon unattainable? All the good one require trade, transfer, or access to the post game.
Yeah but it's not something unheard of. I guess it's more an expansion than a conventional DLC, but yeah, adding mechanics of that size isn't that unheard of in an expansion.
HGSS fixes a lot of tye distribution problems between the safari, walker, and other features. I also feel as though Cliff Cave and the safari helped fix the leveling too. Like just a bit more for people to do before the late Johto game.

Misdreavus and murkrow are available thru the safari or cliff cave too. I used misdreavus-> msimagius on both my HG and SS runs. 

Not a distribution problem, but Extrasensory on the egg Togepi makes Togetic much more viable as a pokemon. Maybe makes Morty and Chuck too easy but was a very welcome change
And status effects like poison
Would be really cool but I assumed flying, ghost, and fire moves are pretty common in competitive play right? Seems like a pokemon that has a really cool concept but not fully executed
    I think giving it so many weaknesses was probably for balance purposes

It's exceptionally hard to balance a Pokemon like that
Barry is actually pretty strong, silver is no joke either
And sneasel
Only in the remakes yeah.
    Nope, never played the remakes.
Yeah sorry I meant in the OGs
    Oh ok, I've only played HG where you can find Murkrows in the safari zone. They should have put some Houndours there too, now that I think about it.
Pokemon Gold was my first Pokemon game and I still will say gen 2 is thrash.
Even the remakes are mediocre, since unless you have trades or randomizers (which most people don't) you are stuck with gen 1 and 2 Pokémon
