[[In vanilla Skyrim what is the single most overpowered skill to level]]


As with most people, I started with a stealth archer fun build. Lots of cool, funny memories. Then I decided to do a pure Mage run but I wanted to focus on enchanting just to see what the challenge would be like and I destroyed all difficulty in this game, if you can get enchanting to 100, you can basically become God. Want to be a full destruction mage never having to worry about mana cost enchant four items with- 25% destruction magic any spell costs zero but seeing as you have two slots when you max out enchanting, I also had alteration permanent paralysis spells with zero cost 
But it doesn't stop there. You can become the best swordsman on the planet just from your enchanting skill just by adding one-handed weapons to the armors.. Even though they're just clothing, you can have more health than you know what to do with more stamina. The options are kind of unlimited really and the beauty of it is enchanting lets you level up any other skill with relative ease with zero perks in the tree taken.
Also as a side note the cash flow starts to become a problem for the shopkeepers when the shops run out of money trying to buy my enchanted weapons so I'm rich.
if you want to get down the glitchy cheating route, add alchemy into the mix and you can break the numbers in the game by drinking a potion enchanting armour, then making a new potion with the enchanted armour buffing that up and so on and so forth. 

I can't think of a more powerful skill tree?


Sneak. The level 100 perk trivializes every single encounter in the game, especially if combined with 30x dagger sneak attack damage.
    But... But... Stealth ARCHER!

Personal note:  as much as I love being a knifey-assassin, finding out the knives only kind of scale with one-handed was a bit disappointing.  Also, having to tell my companion to stay well back to not screw up my silent murder spree can be annoying.

At least the dragons remain something of an actual threat for a while.
        I actually prefer daggers not having their own branch since it means more perks for other skills. The trade off for an assassin is having to level an attacking skill, a defensive skill AND the sneak skill.

And for the companions, yeah that's why I don't run with them on my sneak builds. A lot of micromanagement needed for that
            If you were interested in daggers though, download Ordinator for those sweet dagger perks.

Download NFF (Nether's Follower Framework) so you get a power that acts as a menu to command followers. You can tell them to stop following you from a distance instead of having to walk up to each individual. And if having 10 followers isn't your thing, you can set a hard cap to whatever you want. Seriously, there are so many awesome things about NFF, I can't believe I just discovered it like three weeks ago.
            Daggers do have perks. Besides the backstabs, there is Dual Flurry and Dual Savagery. Plus other perks that apply to daggers, such as Armsman. 

Also, good assassins don't need defense skills. Just saying.
                Those are just one handed perks, that apply to every weapon. They aren't dagger perks.

Also, light armor grants you 50% stam regen at level 60, which is kinda huge.
                    But the speed of daggers is what makes it worthwhile. Dual wielding swords just doesn't compare to dual wielding daggers. 

Also, a single bowl of veggie soup gives you all the stamina you need for five minutes. You only need ONE stamina point to do a power attack, after all. And one stamina gained per second means you have five minutes worth of non-stop power attacks.
                        For the first part, you could have a dagger in left hand and mace in the other hand for max dps at the same attack speed, so then those skills become dagger/mace skills following that logic :P

But yeah, the veggie soup is good for PA but not so good for sprinting so stam regen still helps. And since you'll be doing lots of sprinting, it pays off big time 

Also, and that just a me thing, never really cared for veggie soup. Can't be assed to collect the ingredients even during my Requiem playthroughs, much less so during vanilla runs where it's really not that necessary to abuse power attacks. They are pretty useful for legendary tho
                You’re going to sneak attack a dragon?
            Nice workaround if you need space but don't want pesky followers - Secret Servant from one of the Black Books
            You would just put those perks into daggers though so you’re still leveling an attacking, defensive, and sneak skill…
        > finding out the knives only kind of scale with one-handed was a bit disappointing.

But there are perks for dual wielding daggers, so you can do power attacks that are literally flashing blurs of whirling death. Every one shot an elder dragon with dual daggers? It's far far faaar more satisfying the whittling down the same dragon with arrows over the course of a half hour fight.
        Granted it does make it harder to bring a companion around, but knife assassins can be much more overpowered. 

You get a stealth/one handed berserker orc with the applicable perks and a stealth power attack and you can do thousands of points of damage, and that’s before improving the daggers, enchantments, poisons/potions, or shouts

Stealth archer is also OP but late game it pretty much requires you to have decent smithing and enchanting and takes longer to set up
        i never use companions as any type of stealth character lol
    Combine this with the lucky dagger and you can even fight enemies way above your skill level
    There’s really just one major problem with stealth daggers, dragons. Everything else I’m a badass assassin with full illusion magic for that sweet sweet invisibility, can one shot basically anything except for dragons which require a lot of fuckery to be able to get a backstab on. It’s a great build to ignore the main story with but man dragons got really REALLY annoying, I’m not sure if any other build has such a glaring Achilles heel.
        I would raise you mehrunes razor + blade or woe + elemental fury or slow time + poisons
            What do you mean slow time + poison? Does that effectively increase the duration/effectiveness of poison?
        Can't you just spam sneak to get the shroud proc for crits?
I agree that Enchanting can really reduce the difficulty of the game. It's a little tedious, but you can reach 100 pretty quickly once you become efficient at it, and once you learn Sneak and Banish, money ceases to be an issue as well. I love getting the 'extra' Resist Magic enchantment from the Solitude quest, and becoming 100% immune to magic. With properly enchanted high level armor, you basically become invincible.
    Resist magic caps at 85% (see ‘[Notes](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Resist_Magic)’ 😫)
        That's interesting! I've used the Shield of Solitude along with the regular Resist Magic in previous playthroughs to become, at least what I thought was immune, to magic, but maybe I was actually still taking nominal damage and didn't realize it. My current character doesn't have that much magic resistance bc I need the slots for other enchantments, but UESP is the Bible, so I'm genuinely curious now.
            Absolutely with you 100%. I‘ve spent years getting as close to 100% magic resistance as possible using potion boosted enchants and perks and i was *gutted* when i found out it caps at 85% (in the last few weeks!) 😅
                Side note you can be about 95 percent immune to magic. However, you have to cap your magic resist to 85 and then add in the mix absorb magic which I had to like 60% 
It means even if someone hits you with a spell in that 15% gap you have the absorb magic. 50% of the time will take it so it rounds it up to like 95% in total really
                    Oh that’s awesome well spotted! I tend to use the Atronach perk on top of the resist magic perk + 2x potion boosted solitude resist magic enchant so… probably somewhere around 90% total?
                        Yeah there's a downside tho having magic resistance overrides the absorb so if absorb triggers you get no magic back really as your resistant to it for some reason absorb counts as damage in the numbers behind the scenes of game so your immune but also to your own spells like shield ect
                            If you want, you can farm restoration to pick the perk to get effects against undead +50%, then become a Vampire, then level Alteration for the 30% spell absorption, then get the autronach stone, and you'll have 100% magic absorption(which does not cap at 80 or 90 but actually at 100%) which means not only are you immune to magic but actually absorb magicka from magic damage too. You cant cast summoning spells anymore, but who cares you're literally permanently immune to magic.
                                I never aim for absorption. I enjoy summoning Daedra and absorption can sometimes void a summoning. It’s a bug.
                                    This is why you play with the unofficial patch. That bug is fixed (among others). Sad if you're on an older console with no mods.
                            Unofficial patch fixes that. But I guess people who depend on exploits don't use patches.
                                There are patches to unpatch those specific patches in the Unofficial Patch. It's patches all the way down.
                                    Imagine a separate mod for each and every game bug. It would be a nightmare. So we have an unofficial patch that covers all the bugs. If you insist that a bug not be fixed, it's up to you to manage it otherwise we have a nightmare of thousands of separate mods each fixing a single bug or glitch. 

Or just don't make your character dependent on exploits and crack.
                        Magic absorb has no limit. You can get it to 100% and actually be immune to everything except physical weapon damage. 

If you want to stick with the magic resist (which comes online much earlier and easier), you can cap out your magic resist at 85%, and then cap out the elemental resist at.....75%? I don't remember. But those stack, so 85% reduction from magic resist, and then another 75% on top. So 100 damage is reduced to 15 via magic resist, and then that 15 is reduced to like 3 or 4 damage via the 75% elemental resist. Practically immune, but not quite.
                        If you want, you can farm restoration to pick the perk to get effects against undead +50%, then become a Vampire, then level Alteration for the 30% spell absorption, then get the autronach stone, and you'll have 100% magic absorption(which does not cap at 80 or 90 but actually at 100%) which means not only are you immune to magic but actually absorb magicka from magic damage too. You cant cast summoning spells anymore, but who cares you're literally permanently immune to magic.
                            Nice!
                                Pretty neat! You can still drown, but dont care about:
-dragon breath
-fire traps
-poison dart traps
-spells
-venom spits from monsters
-lava
-soul gem traps
-spriggans and mages as an entirety
-storm and flame atronachs
-Dragon Priests
-Destruction runes
Draugr Thu'ums
                                    Setting out to play a vampire for the first time(!) on this playthrough so, very relevant!
                    Resist Fire, Frost and Shock each also stack with magic resist and themselves cap at 85%.
            "magic resistance" and "fire/frost/shock" resistance stack, so in vanilla you can reduce magic damage from those types to 2.25% of base damage.
            There is no cap on Magic Absorption though. You can get to 100% Absorption pretty easily. Level Alteration yo 100 and grab the Atronach perk as well as the Atronach Stone. This will give you 80% which is great, but for 100% just add Miraak's Robe and either his gloves or boots. 
Alternatively you can become a Vampire, grab the Necromage perk from the Restoration tree, then grab the Atronach perk and stone for 100%.
        That’s why you health and armor buff instead. Who cares about resist magic when you can resist ANYTHING.

Then a fortify two handed piece or some destruction magic armor with 100s of fortify destruction potions and you are literally a god
    Yeah that's my khajit character all he uses is his fists and super heavy armour that's enchanted so much he can barely be hurt.
 My favourite enchanted build is sword shield light armour destruction magic cost reduction to zero but weapons with absorb health and fire damage as the charge does not go down when wearing the enchanted stuff so unlimited healing plus buffing every extra skill I can sneak, one arm, health, block like the idea of my shield actually being so enchanted it can block a dragon attack.  I can still die this way but only if I mess up so still keeps so level of skill needed
        Hang on, will you clarify something?


Are you saying with destruction cost reduction, weapons with destruction style enchant will use less/no charge when being used in combat?


For example, with 50% destruction cost reduction, a sword enchanted with fire damage will use up charge at 50% speed instead of the normal rate?
            Exactly, you spend less charge when hitting with enchanted weapons depending on your appropriate magic skill and cost reduction from armor. For example, with 100% Destruction cost reduction you could use Keening, which only has one charge.
                TIL! Thank you!
    Or at the very least, eliminate the weaknesses of being a Vampire so that it's all pros
    Tbh enchanting was always an easy level for me because I always want to increase speech so It’s loot the place, upgrade with smithing then upgrade with enchanting until of course I get the enchanting magic items perk then I can do it however I feel. Plus it makes more money ofc when you upgrade the items. Literally anything where the chest piece has above a 400 value I just pick up and resell later when it’s decked out.
    Alchemy and enchanting are insanely easy to power level and get rich off of. Within 20-30 minutes you can sit at an alchemy/enchanting shop for as long as you want, raising levels and making money infinitely. 

If you have 3-4K gold, make a handful of iron daggers, but as many soul gems as you can, enchant the daggers with banish, sell for more soul gems, repeat. Ditto for alchemy. 

You can do all this in whiterun easily
Whenever I think about my Skyrim "build" what it ultimately boils down to is all crafting skills at 100. That's what gives you the power and flexibility to do a bunch of different things by making sets of armors with specific bonuses.
    Yeah but that's kinda my point the enchanted skill let's you add become so powerful in any area but even if you ignore the skills say weapons or magic attacks or armour skills
You can still add health regen and hp up plus stamina on there own making you functionally overpowered by being so hard to kill even in rags that are enchanted
        Enchanting 100% is the biggest game changer - especially in terms of what to target early in a playthrough. It can accelerate how quickly you get everything else astronomically.
    I agree I only fully invest in one crafting skill to balance the game, also good for character building
    I just started a no crafting, no bartering run and it's so refreshing not having to hoard everything I come across.  

The moment I usually stop playing is when I hit 100 enchanting and make myself invincible, cause it sucks all the fun out of the game
        That’s what’s helped me enjoy the game most recently, it also puts an emphasis on completing quests for unique gear, and provides a use for a lot of gear that rarely gets used. 

For instance in a pure mage playthrough I used the necromancer amulet, archmage robes + boots, ring of the erudite, morokei, and mystic tuning gloves (for looks) and only invested in magicka to build the epitome of a glass canon, and it was a ton of fun

Melee builds are a bit harder but still doable, if I recall there’s several light and heavy armor sets that can reach the armor cap just with the associated light/heavy perks, damage becomes an issue but weapons like the ebony blade and bloodskaal blade make it a fun playthrough
    The key to any great combat build is the crafting to support it
    Not to mention that you can use it to increase other skills to 100 easier.
Enchanting is pretty good, but i think people are sleeping in blacksmithing. It improves your armor and weapons and lets you reach ridiculous heights, although enchanting is what makes it so busted strong to begin with
    Completely agree that blacksmithing Is amazing.
However in pure  DPS or tank enchanted makes you more of a tank even in rags if you wanted and I can make my fists hit harder then any Warhammer 👍
        Sadly thats not true. Melee weapons will always out damage fists since they not only have enchantments that multiply damage instead of add it, you can also increase their damage with black smithing. Fists only have the ability to add damage with fortify unarmed, and only get a max of ~18 from the firsts if steel perk
            O crap your right, that's a heavy armour perk that makes them so strong not played a fists build in forever
                Its possible to get your fist damage super high using the fortify restoration loop, but just playing without it melee weapons shine more. Also the ability to enchant melee weapons make their damage go even higher. I will agree enchanting is still stronger, since you can get some amazing enchantments, like magic resist and magick cost reduction
    It's the two together. They're totally complimentary. An early game loop for me is to hit Dwemer dungeons. Collect lots of Dwarven scrap to make Dwarven arrows and bows. Collect lots of soul gems from the automatons, and fill them up with Falmer souls, then enchant the bows.
    I think it depends where/when you’re at in the game. My first ever play through in November 2011 I got *really* into crafting right away and got ridiculously overpowered as a result very quickly. Later in the game sneak and enchanting became a lot more important.
        Honestly, its more warped by my experiences with legendary difficulty. The three best skills are easily enchanting, black smithing, and alchemy, cause of how they can loop together, and out of the three, smithing can be the hardest to live without. Enchanting lets you reach completely new peaks once maxed out, but smithing is a requirement for any build with armor or weapons
            Yeah that’s fair. And lord knows how many times I’ve played through, at this point I’m sure you’re in the same boat too. Probably depends on play style as well.
                Yea, a full spell caster wont have any use for blacksmithing since they rely on the flesh spells for their defense. Oh yea, another thing that makes enchantment less necessary is cause you can technically reach max magic resistance or max magic absorb without any enchantments. You can have max magic def and max regular defense without ever touching enchanting
The first time i played, i had no clue and maxed one handed

I was unstoppable afterwards
    One handed dual wielding!
        My next character will probably be dual axe build.
            Add Orc to that build and you'll be unstoppable.
                Make it a Breton and he can tank all the wizards you can throw at him.
            Classic Norseman raider
                He's going to be a Redguard. All planned out.
Illusion
    This is the one. If you max out this skill the game becomes INCREDIBLY boring. All you do is turn a whole dungeon into a frenzy and they all kill each other or you can make them all calm and walk right past them. Add in muffle and invisibility and you don’t have to take anything seriously.
        I find it much less boring than mashing the attack button constantly until you get repetitive stress injury in your fingers. I fail to understand while people think this is the more interesting way to play.
            This is why I hate dungeons. I will only play one-handed, though. A shield and an axe are all a Norseman needs.
    Illusion is the way. It's quick to master, the spells are cheap, and you can train while you walk around, while you grab ingredients, while you get back from the mine to the city. Muffle and Invisibility are self cast, so you don't need a target or enemy.

With Master Illusion you can play the entire game with 0 equipment, no weapons, and not be touched by anything. No need to manage Magicka, no need to run from enemies, no need for potions.

Harmony have a huge area of effect and works behind walls, doors, whatever is in your way. Cast it on the wilderness and every animal around is friendly. On a cave, everything on the cave is friendly (even vampires). When the Magicka restores just cast again.

The problem with Harmony is the 4-5 seconds cast time. Use Become Ethereal first, and you are untouchable. Only dragons are safe from you, and they are the only thing you have to fear.
        Plus four named bosses. Harkon, Kaarstag, Ebony Punk, and Miraak.
            Kaarstag is vulnerable to Pacify. Never tried talking to the other three, but I will know in a few days, or weeks.
        This has gotta be the most boring sounding playthrough I’ve heard so far. Lol just running through the game hiding from enemies and not fighting anyone?
            It's a peaceful life...
    I love Illusion. One of my latest characters is a stealth mage. Illusion + Sneak + Destruction with a minor in Conjuration. It's hilarious to watch the affects of illusion spells or to simply muffle + invisibility then ghost right through crowds of enemies

Try Mayhem in Riften (market or thieves guild) or at the peace meeting (high Hrothgar). Hysterical
    Yeah but all those points in illusion and I can use any spell from illusion for free if I want to from my enchanting even the master level because it's very easy to level up if you're using the very highest cost spells for free I can't see it being better then enchanting
        You can use them for free, but they will not affect higher lvl npcs, undead, daedra or automatons without the illusion perks 
            Yeah but casting rapid fire expert spells handles that plus neat trick if the spell doesn't work it still counts towards LV up that skill so with all the perks you can get very fast no reason I can't add them to the build but I do get your point it is hard to argue with an aoe spell that makes everyone kill each other
                With Illusion you don't need rapid fire expert spells, they are all area of effect. The Master level spell, Harmony, affect a very large area, works even behind doors, multiple levels, and lasts for an entire minute. With no enemies around, you restore your Magicka in less than a minute and can cast it again.

You don't need any gear to reduce Magicka cost, because you only need to cast it once.
        You can go to level 100 in Illusion on Dragonsreach without stepping outside and buying only Courage (novice) or Calm (adept) spells. No need to buy soul gems, no need to buy or create weapons or armor, no need to carry anything around.

With invisibility nobody sees you, with Muffle nobody hears you, with Calm/Pacify/Harmony nobody attacks you, with Frenzy/Mayhem they all kill each other while you watch on the corner, silent and invisible.

It's the only skill that makes you truly untouchable by anything but a dragon. All the others could make you unkillable at higher levels, but nothing makes you untouchable. Having fortify health, resist fire, dremora lords as friends are useful, but you still can die. Cast Muffle plus Pacify plus Invisibility and nothing harms you, not even Karstaag.

You will need something to kill the enemies, but an iron dagger while invisible does a lot of damage.
Pickpocket. "Grrr, I'm a big ruftytufty guard and I'm gonna-where have my clothes gone...?"
    Yeah but pick pockets without the stealth skill is difficult or at least awkward however I will give it to you just taking your enemies weapons clothing is overpowered as hell
    I'll never forget the first time I pickpocketed a Briarheart off of a Forsaken Briarheart.
    Max pickpocket chance is 90%. You can get that with enchanting at the base level pickpocket. Which is annoying because with the enchantments the perks are basically unnecessary but you still have a huge chance to fail. With 90% I've actually failed twelve 90% in a row. Obviously 90 is high, but there's never a guarantee unless you abuse the paralyze glitch. 

I go to level 50 pick pocket for the extra pockets +100 carry weight perk then basically only use it for fun or missions and it hardly ever levels again

Don't get me wrong, pick pocket has hilarious applications and is definitely fun. It's just occasionally frustrating, and leveling feels unnecessary when you max out so early
        Ahhhh but I'm fairly sure you can only nick people's clothes with the 100 perk. Which is of course the main reason to do it. Entirety of Markarth discussing why everyone's naked this morning and if it could somehow be related to the crouching cat man that passed through yesterday.
            Lol yeah true. But I mostly use it to reverse pick pocket items. I have gotten to 100 before but I did training for the majority of those levels then slowly crawled my way to 100. I only ever bother getting above 50 for role play reasons (my thief characters) And I hate the grind or waste of gold every time. 

Lol the only perk tree I find completely useless is the lockpicking tree, but pickpocket is one of the more irritating ones for me personally. I understand not everyone feels this way. If you like it, more power to you :)
    This seems so fun and I’m definitely going to try it this playthrough, I just need to level up my sneak to be able to do it mid-combat.

I already have pickpocket to 100 though, so most NPCs are currently walking around in their underwear :)
Honestly? Sneak. The AI in this game is beyond stupid and even having a small handful of sneak perks makes them fail to see you from 2 inches in front of them. I can't imagine how broken it is when you have it completely maxed out. 

...Then again, you can completely viably use enchanting or alchemy to achieve that same effect. My only hang-up is the former takes fucking ages to level.
    While I agree somewhat it saves more time to level enchanting to speed up everything else put some sneaky enchants on and you can be surrounded were you would be normally seen with low LV sneak you shoot up so fast it's unreal
    Yeah I've gotten to something like level 97 on my current playthrough without making much of an effort, and haven't bothered getting any of the perks past about the  level 60 or 70 mark, and it's already ridiculous how much I can get away with.
    I’ll also add it’s stupidly easy to level up (even without exploits).

When with Ralof or Hadvar—either in the beginning of Hellene keep before the cage gate, or at the bear—turn the difficulty to legendary, take a dagger, remove your clothes, and start sneak attacking until you reach your desired level; 60 is sufficient enough to wreck people, but you can get to 100 pretty easily, and you’ll also passively level one-handed to 30 as well.

You can do this with one handed, two handed, and even destruction and block if you’re a masochist. But sneak, for some reason or another, starts off iffy, but then you’ll be leveling up almost every single hit for most of it.
    Sneak backstab the greybeards while they sit and pray. Get the 15x damage multiplier sneak perk and you level that shit like crazy.
        Oh nah I meant that enchanting is difficult to level in comparison to sneak or alchemy. Those two are super easy to get up just by playing normally. Enchanting is an active time investment and often expensive
Alchemy and its not even close
    Had to scroll too far to see this. Its not only for the potions and poisons usefulness themselves but for the ridiculous amount of money you can make. I  start every run collecting all the blue mountain flower, lavender, and hanging moss in solitude and whiterun. Put em all together and u start your playthrough already rich. Then once u get a farm or just planters its already game over. Plant Scaly Pholiota, Creep Cluster, and Mora Tapinella for infinite money.  
  
It also translates well into Enchanting and Smithing because you can buy the materials needed for powerleveling them quick.
        Boom.  I am a rich elf because of alchemy.
        It also helps that the Scaly, Creep, and Mora, on top of the money, also level up alchemy stupidly fast.

And the latest anniversary addition also added Golden Hills Plantation, which with the extort decoration addiction allows you to plant a whopping *44 plants*. If you also invest some money and resources, you can also get a steward and farm workers who’ll passively generate money every day or so and even give you some additional harvested plants.
    Stealth archer + paralysis poison is pretty fun.

Without exploits you make an absurd amount of money from potions. Bootstrapping enchanting and smithing becomes trivial.
        You honestly don’t need stealth with paralysis poisons
    It’s often been stated that Alchemy, Enchanting, and Smithing are like Skyrim’s triforce with the power they hold together. However, it’s the alchemy and enchanting loop where the power truly lies.

If anything, the alchemy skill tree kind of gives us all friendly reminder on how stupidly powerful potions and apothecaries would be, realistically speaking.
    Care to explain a little more because I can see the enchanted bonuses and I have maxed out alchemy in many playthroughs and while some of the potions do give you incredible power more so than enchanting. They are temporary, not permanent and I'm talking obviously about not glitching the numbers in the game and keeping it standard
        They are temporary, but you can always just keep drinking more potions. Once you get a home where you can plant ingredients and the perk where you are harvesting more ingredients per node, you can make your concoctions all day long. And honestly some of the poisons you can make will just flat out delete enemies.
            See I have never really tried a game were I use this as my main skill it was always there to aid me in my enchanting breaking the game to add every magic school reduced cost to my robes ect gotta look cool if your the greatest sorcerer that can cast any spell in existence for free 🤣
                Reduced cost is great, but alchemy can increase the actual effectiveness of your spells. Why cast 10 times when you can just cast once, you know? And the two aren't mutually exclusive. I've actually never gone full alchemy either, but even dipping my toes in was a real eye opener.
                    > Reduced cost is great, but alchemy can increase the actual effectiveness of your spells. 

This right here.  The main weakness in the game's magic mechanics is that skill improvement in the school results in reduction of magicka consumption to cast spells rather than enhancement of the magnitude/duration of the spell effects.  

Alchemy fills that gap, letting me cast *Thunderbolt* once for 1000 damage at some magicka cost rather than casting the same spell ten times for 100 damage each at no magicka cost.
                If you have anniversary edition alchemy has never been better since you can get a farm with 20+ plots for planting. Want to paralyze someone? Theres a potion for that, Frenzy? Potion, boost one hand? Potion, boost your armor skill? Potion, destruction not doing enough damage? Potion……. Plant some Mora topenelli, Scalia pilowhatnots and creep cluster and you’ll level up alchemy super fast and get a bunch of gold in the process
        Does your armor skill suck? Have some fortify armor skills, some healing potions, and some fortify health.


Does your weapon skill suck? Have a fortify potion for that plus a poison. Pro tip: imp stool + canis root plus nirnroot causes paralysis plus some nasty damage to health and stamina. 


Gotta pickpocket and you don't know how? Potions will help with that too. And selling to your fence? Have a barter buff.


Don't have enough magicka to cast that spell you learned? Alchemy can give you extra points and then buff your spell.


Alchemy can backfill weakness in just about any part of the game. And the potions you don't need can be converted to cash.


Once you get the inventory management figured out, it's absolutely game breaking. I play on legendary difficulty because of alchemy. 
            > Alchemy can backfill weakness in just about any part of the game. And the potions you don't need can be converted to cash.

Which also boosts your Speech skill!
        well there is a certain glitch related with fortify restoration that can make you literally god with some astronomical numbers in hp mana or weapon damage( but without glitches its also decent enough to make some upgrades too )
    I hit 100 in Alchemy in each playthrough, it is very easy to max it. I love my 130% boost to Smithing potion, lets me turn a pair of gauntlets with 15 armor into gauntlets with 70 armor. I have characters with 100 alchemy, 100 smithing & 100 enchanting = so many dead enemies! Alchemy starts it off and finances all the rest.

If I need more perk points then I make Alchemy legendary and VERY quickly get it back to 100.
Conjuration is one of the most versatile magic trees, mostly because summons do more damage alongside enemies on higher difficulties, plus if you aren't using the unofficial patch it's very easy to level

Generally, two storm atronachs, wrathmen or dremora lords can handle most enemies, and with CC content you have a lot more options like certain necromancer based summons, including a bone Colossus
    Totally agree, this is one of my favourite builds. An unlimited stream of dremora lords will eventually take down anything while you chill, and for extra fun and games you can reanimate people for shits and giggles. Lot of fun to kill a bandit, then reanimate him to fight their former friends. And it’s all innate to the character; if you ever get your stuff taken (like that one jail mission) it barely slows you down. Oh no, big tough guy with gauntlets is blocking the way? My demon summon with a sword disagrees. Oh and you’re now my permanent corpse ally till i get sick of you.
Necromage, as a vampire. It makes almost *everything else* op
I agree with you on enchanting for the most point. The difficulty is getting it to level it up to actually be  really effective.
I would argue sneak is the most overpowered but you do have to combine it with other skills to make use of it. But it is incredibly easy to level up without trying.
    Yeah I thought sneak but needs archery or swords skills leveled and of course with enchanting you can make sneak better then with the skill points put in mostly it's why I'm struggling to find something better
        Very true. I want to get my enchanting up fast on the character I currently play. What is the best way to do this in your experience? I'm just struggling with the huge money required for soul gems and being early on in the game without much money.
Enchanting, Sneak, Alchemy and Illusion.
Sneak and archery combo
I had never bothered with alchemy before, so this play through I decided to give it a go. I’m only using thief stone skills. It really is the GOAT skill tree. Previously I would have said Smithing or Enchanting but now it’s definitely Alchemy. 

Down a couple fortify restoration potions and then make a dozen super Frenzy poisons, a dozen complete magika depletion poisons, some super sneaky potions, etc. 

I’m using a long bow and iron arrows. It’s so much fun! Enemies who would normally resist Fury don’t stand a chance against my Fury arrows. Dragons fall out of the sky because my poison arrows drain all their stamina! Big Bosses suddenly don’t do anything because they’re out of Magic and move at 1/2 speed. Even without skill points in anything but Alchemy, I am the most powerful person in Skyrim (as long as I don’t run out of the juice).
    Ok that sounds amazing to play but gotta wonder how that would stand up to the enchanted absorb build every hit gets my hp and stamina back hell if on daggers the DPS is a monster , would be a cool fight the master ranged poisoner Vs the close range lifesteal . Does spell resistance work on posions or absorb spells??
        No, fire/frost/shock/magic resistance does nothing against poison, that's why there's specifically a resist poison enchantment, but even with maxed enchanting, it's pretty difficult to make it noteworthy. I've played Skyrim since it's inception and from a vanilla standpoint, and I've never seen it go much higher than 15%, which doesn't help when you've been hit by a poison that paralyzed you and drains x amount of health per second. Then I can just finish you off with my sword if the poison fails to kill you outright.

I could be wrong about the resist poison percentage though. It's just such a useless enchantment to apply on anything because so few enemies use it. I think off the top of my head, it's just things like Falmer and Chaurus. Nothing else in the game really does poison damage iirc.
Years ago I did a playthrough with a pacifist illusionist.  I was so overpowered pretty early on in the game it took away the fun. I think I had to kill like 10 enemies total to advance the main quest line to beat it.
IMO an Overpowered skill needs to BOTH be worth leveling AND putting skill points into.

So while I ALWAYS level up Stealth, I often only put a few skill points into it.

Enchanting and Smithing though, regardless of the build, I will level up AND spend Skill Points on. So it is one of those. Or maybe a combination of both.
Enchanting.  Literally game breaking and not fun.  I'm  on zero enchanting this run and minimal alchemy.  

Only creating minimal potions that matter to my character.  Minimal alchemy perks like maybe 3 deep on the tree.

No extra carry weight bonuses other than a backpack.

Only enchanted gear I find will work.

Only using smithing 

Minimal archery


I totally understand survival mode and I am thinking of switching it on for an additional handicap to make it seem harder to do things.
I think you could make the case that Conjuration is a top contender.

Yes, it doesn't make you personally as strong as enchanting can, but, you can summon all sorts of creatures to do what you need. In addition you can utilize the atronach forge to get very incredibly strong equipment to boot. This replicates almost everything enchanting can do other than two enchants per item.

Without considering resto loops, I think conjuration might be the most OP skill. It does require a bit more creative use to get that kind of power.
If there was ever a only utilize 1 skill challenge on a character Conjuration would be the way to go. You can get it to 100 in 20 mins at the start of the game and then have 2 dremora lords that can kill anything easily.
    How do you power level conjuration that fast/early??
        Create character, grab mage stone, go straight to whiterun, get soul trap, find or create a dead body, spam soul trap. Wait 1 hr when u run out of magicka, repeat.
Smithing and Enchanting are the most overpowered skills, in my opinion.

Smithing helps you improve your gear to the point where you can cheese through Legendary difficulty even with fur armor, and Enchanting just amplifies that by another 500% with enchantments like resistance, reduced MP consumption, banish, etc.

Add to the list Alchemy and you can pretty much make God-tier gear with the right potions.
Conjuration completely breaks the game even on the highest difficulty. You can summon two dremora lords from long distance and then just start looting while they clean everything up for you.
Alteration is up there, purely for Transmute. You can get Transmute skill at lv 1 immediately after leaving Helgen. Next just mine/buy all the iron ore you ever see and money is a non-issue. 

Also powerlevels smithing, since you can turn 2 iron bars into gold rings and jeweled necklaces. Then of course you enchant the rings...
Wanna try something funny? Raise Block to max so you can slap anyone including dragons with your shield
Smithing, enchanting, or Alchemy can all break the game
Honestly, my current playthrough I've been avoiding the main quest and all guilds, just to level up and eventually get my alchemy and enchanting to 100 (without exploits). Im lvl 51 now and my smithing has been at 100 for a while already, alchemy is at 96 and enchanting at 81. Could be higher if I focused on them, but this time I want to get there by just playing the game. Destruction is up to 91 already, Draugr Death Overlords just take 5 elemental blasts, and that takes care of the rest of the room too. And that's without any super overpowered gear that I want to craft when I hit enchanting lvl 100. Yesterday I got attacked by an elder dragon and a blood dragon simultaniously ... I had to take a whole magicka potion to take them both down before any of the town guards were able to get close enough to hurt themselves on my splash damage.

I haven't even tried to get the overpowered gear yet (got like 54 filled grand soul gems saved up) and I'm already totally OP. I can get a mammoth down to a sliver of health with just 2 dual cast elemental blasts. Followed up by a single shot from my soul trap bow to finish the job.  
Seriously, Vokun got up from his slab, so I start blasting, he never even managed to cast a single spell my way.

I started doing block on the sides for funsies, it's at 60 I think, so I can block and shield bash most single opponents down, with only the shield. Even a draugr death lord is no match for a well timed shield bash, and you can boop the dragons on the nose too. The only peeps you I to watch out for are other magic casters.

So my answer is DESTRUCTION. You can lay Skyrim down, even without much in the way of enchanted gear. After that it's BLOCK, though block often does need some other damage done on the side.
I don't know why more people don't just set game to novice and spare themselves the grind.
    Not everyone wants to play on baby mode. If the gameplay loop feels like a grind why play?
Alchemy purely for the fortitude restoration loop you can make yourself immortal, make your weapons do millions of damage, if killings not your thing you could make paralysis potions that will paralyze someone for 3 real life years, and can become rich af if you just sell the potions you make as there value increases the better the potions
Dual wielding track makes things pretty stupid easy sometimes.
Smithing for me, without a doubt.  You can level it fast, and even at later levels, 100 smithed weapons and armour results in one cutting nearly anything.  Double enchanting further is just the sprinkles and cherry on top of a disgraceful slaughter.
Conjuration or illusion
Blocking 100, shield charge. It's essentialy a fus-ro-dah that requires shield, stamina and a bit of sprinting. No cooldown.
Final skill in Enchanting, Extra Effect. Breaks the game in two all on its own with every article of clothes or whatever weapon you carry having two Enchantments
Alchemy and enchanting for that absolutely broken mage build.
Other than the crafting skill trees (which are obviously the strongest, especially alchemy or enchanting), I would say Alteration is up there. Having the resist magic and spell absorption perks makes you pretty much immune to magic (especially in combination with the atronach stone and/or being a Breton)
100% sneak or enchanting
You can cast Magelight outside Solitude and aim at the top of the mountain, netting you levels quicker than a lot of other ways.
Restoration and Conjuration.
Archery, right next to Sneak. You become a stealth god 1 hitting anything in your path.
Stealth archer
While I don't want to say enchanting, frost/chaos combo exists and is absolutely busted on stalhrim weapons.
A combination of Alchemy and Enchanting will make you Superman. Enchanting boosts your Alchemy and vice versa. Plus the fortify restoration loop in Alchemy can make any build insane.
Destruction. Max out shock damage get Mentor's ring and dupe it 10 times then ring stack then just use unbounded storms. No NPC will ever touch you again
I think it's hands down enchanting,followed by blacksmithing. Combine these two and your damage output is insane no matter which main damage skill you go with and their enhancements eclipse anything else you might get up to.
Base game necromage perk on a vampire is nutty from what I remember. Though that more so makes everything *else* op
Archery, sneak, enchanting, alchemy, and smithing.. with these combined you can one hit kill anything on legendary mode
i like pick pocketing and lock picking but that's just me, you can get sum oretty good stuff from that though
enchanting and alchemy both very powerful.
Pickpocket. People can try to cover themselves, but you’ve already seen everything.
    I always get it to level 50 before i ever go to the flagon since everyone carries gems and jewelry
Block.
My go to is archery. I think its pretty useful to go around a cave and take out a hoard of bandits getting 2.0x for sneak while slow-mo zooming in on every enemy
Stealth, cast invisibility, one shot anything with a daedric dagger
It's alchemy and it's not even close
Hands down, alchemy is the most overwhelmingly broken skill in the game. It simply loops around endlessly. If you want a permanent effect, you pair a potion with enchanting. You might think enchanting on its own would be op, but it doesn't actually loop on its own. While they pair insanely well, alchemy offers (due to game mechanics/restrictions) more effects. I can make a potion of fortify destruction and cast flame cloak to instantly kill all enemies in a loaded area.
I personally go with a full on tank. I have more fun and it doesn’t take as long compared to a stealth archer, which is a meme at this point.

I run Breton for the magic resist, then run to cheese the blacksmithing and enchanting perks to be able to forge and improve the best armor and weapons I can while leveling up the somewhat crappy one handed skill tree and focus on axes and maces. I also throw points into blocking skill tree but I refuse to get the slow time skill, that makes combat a pain. Then I’ll throw points into the right side of the heavy skill tree and near the end of the game, whatever I have I’ll go into the left skill tree for fun as a brawler.

I also think Alteration has great skills for tanks with magic resistance. I’ll also take the Atronach Stone for magic absorption. Basically at the end of the day I can’t get hurt by magic or dragon’s breath. 

For fun I’ll start to level up Destruction and Restoration for improved healing and enchantment damage. I’ll also level up Alchemy sporadically during the whole process to improve my potions to make even better armor and enchantments. 

For fun, since I’m a completionist, I’ll go to stealth and speech and max those out along with other perks.
Depends totally on your playstyle, for me it's probably Two Handed. I do lots of sneak attacks, and I have a special one-hit warhammer no matter where I am.
Pickpocket
I think conjuration. The ability to infinitely summon multiple atronachs or just dead thralling enemies for combat or walking infinite storage is pretty great. Magic in general. And sneak as well
For me it's enchantment and smithing
Alchemy.

It eliminates the need for money (sell a bunch of fortify health potions and you'll be rich in no time), and having money allows you to get any weapons, armor or gear you want. Also your enchanting exploit doesn't work without alchemy. 

Plus as with enchanting, you can fortify any skill you want. The trade off is that it isn't permanent, but I find alchemy much faster to level because XP levels are directly based off of the value of the potion. So all those fortify health potions you made to get money also get you hella XP. Enchanting doesn't seem to work the same way, and even if it did, you would still need objects to enchant, which would mean weighing yourself down with weapons, armor, clothes, and jewelry, whereas alchemy ingredients are far cheaper to obtain if buying, and super plentiful out in the world and don't weigh nearly as much as a suit of armor.

Now if you add mods into the mix, things get very silly very quickly. I have a mod that makes Jarrin Root (the thing you put in the Emperor's soup in the Dark Brotherhood questline) a plantable thing; it is not plantable or obtainable outside the questline in vanilla Skyrim without console commands. As I mentioned earlier, XP is directly tied to value of the potion which in the game files is tied to the ingredient's magnitude. The magnitude for Jarrin Root is so much higher than everything else in the game (since it's supposed to be an instant kill poison you use exactly once in the game) that it gives MEGA xp, and I use it to make what I call "dragon killers" or "dragon killing poisons" that do anywhere from 3000 - 6000 damage depending on alchemy skill and perks. And because of the high magnitude, "dragon killers" can be sold for a shit ton of money as well.

Jarrin Root isn't the only thing you can do this with. I taught myself how to mod the magnitude of ingredients. Awhile back, I made a small mod for myself that makes nightshade much more deadly, since it's a real plant and is extremely deadly irl as well. Now I can make potions that increase Destruction damage by 700% - 2000%.

I realize mods are completely out of the scope of this question, but I love alchemy so much, I just wanted to share with y'all how you can use and abuse it in both vanilla and modded Skyrim and my experiences with it. I used to be purely a Smith or enchanter or both, but ever since I learned of alchemy's unlimited potential years ago, every character I make is an alchemical master no matter what else the build entails.
Alchemy. The restoration potion glitch allows you to get shit that breaks the game. If done right you can have fur armor and iron weapons that are 1000x better than dragonbone.
Can someone please tell me how to get crazy numbers with echanting and potion making? Ive played skyrim a fair amount and have tried on NUMEROUS occasions to get stupid high numbers, but cant break the "standard range"

What have i missed? Is there a good youtube tutorial that helps when players just cant do it?
    Just YouTube fortify restoration glitch
I often like doing a no magic playthrough which includes no enchanting. The best you can do is smithing and potions, or natural resistances and atronach stones. Keeps some challenge in the game. Usually though in werewolf as well. It has synergy.
One handed dual wielding.
For me, it's alchemy. You can get most of the same effect - or for spellcasting stronger effects - with potions as you can with enchanting. The 50% poison resistance and greenthumb perks are also great.
How about the speech tree? I would say money doesn't grow on trees. Except in this game it kind of does. Thanks Todd. Seriously though. You talk about enchanting sure it's powerful. But how are you going to break the economy if you can't sell your wares? To be able to sell your wares to everyone you need the merchant(?) perk. I think we ca agree speech checks are kind of a joke in this game. So then how about bounties when you're not a part of the thieves guild? They can get pretty expensive if you don't have money to pay them off. Speaking of paying. How do you pay yourself to buy those grand soul gems? I'm not going to argue that speech is the most Op tree. Only saying something for intellectual debate. Cheers friends.
Sneak. I wear heavy armor and I can still get up close with heavy attacks with a hammer.
Block.

The perk that makes time slow down on enemy heavy attacks bugs often (maybe 5% of the time), which turns you into The Flash.
Archery
Personally, I play spell/sword for the versatility. And with that I gotta say either resto or alteration. Yeah, fireball sword is fun. But what about sword, and stupid high armor at the flick of your wrist? And if somehow you do take damage you heal it back up. Oh, your magic is low? Turn health into magic. Oh, your health is low? Make more health, and perks give you stamina on heal. Bored? Turn iron into gold, make sick jurrlery. Once you start throwing destruction and illusion spells on top of it all it’s like you’re slowly become if the demigod you really are even at a low level.
Watch The Spiffing Brit over on Youtube. He’s got 10+ hours about it.
Destruction and alchemy. Especially if you play on legendary or survival mode.
Conjuration to 100 with 2 powerful dead thralls, than get the conjuration stone and raise an almost unlimited number of dead once per day. 
You can run around with your own personal army of the dead.
alchemy easily. probably the fastest way to infinite money, lets you get nearly infinitely powerful weapons, armor, enchants, etc. It’s why i literally never level alchemy because it trivializes the game to a ridiculous level
Toss up between Sneak, Marksman, and Illusion.  


Sneak: The ability to sneak past anything.  Yeah, sure, all your weapons do practically no damage because we have a mod that hard caps every other skill for the purpose of this ranking, but high level sneak basically means invincibility and and all the time in the world to slowly whittle down foes.  Light/Heavy armor skill alone doesn't do that.  Magic resist enchant doesn't affect getting cleaved by a sword.  The enchant bonus on level 100 sneak enchant to a level 15 sneak skill actually isn't as much as you'd think, though Muffle would be a game changer.  


Marksman: (This is the internal name for Archery, and if you try incpcs in the console you can't use the word 'archery') The ability to deal massive damage \*from a distance\* and tie it into sneak is a huge game changer.

  
Illusion: Frenzy the entire battlefield and make them kill each other down to the last guy, which you then Calm and stab him to death.
Most people would say Enchanting.

I would say Alchemy.

Even with level 15 Enchanting, you could Restoration pot loop and get any equipment with stats as high as you want. Not to mention the financial value Alchemy has, and the fact that you can probably farm the most profitable possible potion with common ingredients you can find outside Riverwood.

But, if you are going glitchless without Resto loop, then i would say Enchanting. You can get a 100% cost reduction for any kind of magic, leveling Enchanting and some Alchemy very easily. I usually prefer going a 4 pieces Master cost reduction set (the ones that buff your Magika regeneration as well, it also gets you around 90% cost reduction), leaving the helmet open for something else, like Ahzidal mask for the Ignite build (my favorite dmg build). Enchantment is also broken, because it interacts with the Necromancy perk as well (although many consider this as a bug as well).
Blacksmithing + enchanting is so OP it’s crazy
Didn't we see this post yesterday?

In any case, my answer remains the same: Illusion.

If you bother to take the perks (why no peeps ever take perks?) then it will affect every enemy in the game except dragons and four named bosses. EVERY ENEMY.
Alchemy, you could grind alchemy, enchanting, Smithing and Speech all at the same time if you do it right
I mean gotta be enchanting since you can vastly increase your stats. Worst is hands down lock picking.
Alchemy. You don't even need to grind it. In casual play you will easily end up with bags full of potions worth more than any one shopkeep can afford to buy and powers which allow you to tank the final boss indefinitely. The cold on survival is the only real threat to an alchemist in this game.
Destruction. You can blow up anything!!
all the crafting skills, i have managed to achieve over 5000 damage on a weapon in vanilla with those maxed
100 sneak pretty op
Seen something where you can enchant something with a health bonus or whatever. However you can't remove the item ever or else it kills you.
Alchemy. Want damage? Poison your weapon and get an additional 100 damage per hit or paralyze your enemy. Want bulk? Craft cheap health potions that heal 150 health a pop. Want better crafting? Boost smithing efficiency by 150%. Want better stealth? Use invisibility potions. 


Alchemy is utterly broken and can be useful very early on unlike enchanting which only works later on in t he game
Restoration, every time. If you want to do the fortify bug you need it for necromage, but even if you don't, its easily the best spellsword class.

You save money by not needing potions ever again, since with just a few perks your Resto scales higher than your potion levels.

Infinite stamina sound fun? Restoration 40 makes your fast healing give you nearly a full stamina bar as well as healing you, so run and power attack to your hearts content.

Top tier restoration is great too, since before even getting the black books you can get a free full heal once a day in the event that you get NEARLY 2 shot (note, does not protect against true 1 shots).

TLDR: Restoration because infinite stamina, HP, magika, once a day deth defiance, better potions, easier to fight in dungeons overall, saves you money and time.
Just enchanting and smithing. You go balls deep with those two it turns into such an easy ride
Lockpicking😎
Heavy armor
Illusion
The backstab skill. Then go to the dark brotherhood hideout to get the “shrouded hand wraps”. This makes you do 30x damage backstabs. Then all you need is the “muffle” spell and the “invisibility” spell, so you don’t have to waste so many skill points to make yourself sneakier. Using an “exquisite ebony dagger” on expert difficulty still one shots most death lords and dragon priests. After that i max out conjuration. With a little bit of alteration and destruction skills. Summon 2 dremora lords, or just one and like a atronach since you can summon 2 creatures to help you. Let them do the work while you sit back with long range destruction magic. Alteration is for the stealthy spells. You can also be boring and paralyze enemies if you’re forced to be close to said enemies. Keep in mind I’m talking about lvl 40 and up. I just said my route for the build. The point is to try sneaking first, but there is always plan b lol
I haven't gone the mage or thief route yet, I'd always go warrior (being a big fan of being crazy strong and tough). I might make some characters that go that route sometime.

With that said though, I do dabble in trying to upgrade all my skills (so even though I usually go warrior, I like to also use and increase my skills for thief and mage), and as far as I can tell, I don't think there is a wrong answer at all, but I think stealth has probably got to be the most OP for me. Like, not only is it a rather easy skill to level up on, but when you get to level 100, it funny but also cool to be able to down all of your enemies and they practically have no idea where you are, you feel like a monster from a horror movie. Or heck, you don't feel like fighting at the moment, either because you aren't strong enough to face the enemy yet or merely out of disinterest, just simply sneak past them and be on your merry way.
Alchemy
If we're talking with exploits, Alchemy literally makes you a God. Without exploits it's sheild, illusion or Conjuration. Magic in general is easy to level, and each has high tier spells that can work together to make you untouchable...

Sneak, illusion, and Conjuration together makes you truly unbeatable. Laughing at your enemies from the shadows fighting your endless summons.
    When I say a God I mean instant death to anyone hostile with the Alchemy Restoration loop exploit, using Fortify destruction potion with a cloak spell.
Conjuration! Daemora jumping outta portals to wreck my opponents in one swipe of a greatsword
Yeah, enchanting is bananas strong. Once you get that up you can then enchant your armor to make potion making stronger, which then you can make potions to make enchanting strong, and just repeat that process until you're making stupidly powerful everything.
Alchemy
i think heavy armour is the most powerful thing to upgrade if you max it out then you could get hit by a giant 6 times and barely get a damage dealt
Alteration gets slept on. Play Breton for 50% magic resist. Level Alteration for 30% additive magic resist for 80% total without any gear or quest-given perks.

Get the Atronoch skill from Alteration for 30% chance to absorb all harmful effects from poisons, diseases and spells as well.
Enchanting. Specially with restoration glitch or adding console command item for enchanting that cannot be found in the game.
Alchemy
Enchanting, Alchemy, and smithing. There is a way to super powerful enchantment that makes your weapons capable of having tens of thousand or even millions as their base damage. Making you effectively a god.
Enchanting
Speech, duh.
Alchemy.
I recently tried a tank build orc, never increased magic, only perks on heavy armor, block and one hand.

Went full speed at everything like a bull at the gate, and used berserker rage going into a boss fight.

Didn't even smithing or enchant. Just wore any chunk of armour I found that was better than I had.

Bizarrely enough it was my fastest (realtime) playthrough ever.
Alchemy is the goat.
Speech
Alteration. At higher levels you absorb a certain amount of mana from spells, resist a certain amount of magic, and the mage armor perk... Plus the dragon flesh spell resists 80 percent of all damage
Seeing as I have the symbol of restoration tattooed on my wrist, I'm a bit biased, but I've always loved it. Being low-level but being able to heal consistently in combat while you attack someone has just always been so smooth for my play-style, personally.
Id say alchemy. It is essential to maximize enchanting and smithing. It also has the benefit of being objectively the best of the 3 crafting skills for profit.
I love all the different answers in this thread. Skyrim did a really good job at making lots of different end game builds feel overpowered in their own way. (*cries in pure mage builds)

I would argue that the holy trinity of crafting skills of Enchanting, Smithing, and Alchemy are the most exploitable, and therefore make you feel the most OP.
Merchant
Ik this post is for Vanilla but why do so many people sleep on the Masterly perk tree mod? Only ever hear about Ordinator/Vokrii or Adamant not to take away from either of them, I used to use Ordinator but too many patches needed which forced me to look elsewhere and I like how Masterly basically expands on the Vanilla tree while improving it simultaneously
Sneak. You master that and get that 100 skill, and it won't matter if you have a whole room up in arms at you with someone on top of you, you crouch and you get to see the stupidity of Skyrim's AI at its finest as the whole room starts chasing their tails because you just pulled a Houdini.
1. Alteration- infinite level exploit 
2. Alchemy- fortify restoration exploit
Enchanting and it's not even close.
But... But... Stealth ARCHER!

Personal note:  as much as I love being a knifey-assassin, finding out the knives only kind of scale with one-handed was a bit disappointing.  Also, having to tell my companion to stay well back to not screw up my silent murder spree can be annoying.

At least the dragons remain something of an actual threat for a while.
    I actually prefer daggers not having their own branch since it means more perks for other skills. The trade off for an assassin is having to level an attacking skill, a defensive skill AND the sneak skill.

And for the companions, yeah that's why I don't run with them on my sneak builds. A lot of micromanagement needed for that
        If you were interested in daggers though, download Ordinator for those sweet dagger perks.

Download NFF (Nether's Follower Framework) so you get a power that acts as a menu to command followers. You can tell them to stop following you from a distance instead of having to walk up to each individual. And if having 10 followers isn't your thing, you can set a hard cap to whatever you want. Seriously, there are so many awesome things about NFF, I can't believe I just discovered it like three weeks ago.
        Daggers do have perks. Besides the backstabs, there is Dual Flurry and Dual Savagery. Plus other perks that apply to daggers, such as Armsman. 

Also, good assassins don't need defense skills. Just saying.
            Those are just one handed perks, that apply to every weapon. They aren't dagger perks.

Also, light armor grants you 50% stam regen at level 60, which is kinda huge.
                But the speed of daggers is what makes it worthwhile. Dual wielding swords just doesn't compare to dual wielding daggers. 

Also, a single bowl of veggie soup gives you all the stamina you need for five minutes. You only need ONE stamina point to do a power attack, after all. And one stamina gained per second means you have five minutes worth of non-stop power attacks.
                    For the first part, you could have a dagger in left hand and mace in the other hand for max dps at the same attack speed, so then those skills become dagger/mace skills following that logic :P

But yeah, the veggie soup is good for PA but not so good for sprinting so stam regen still helps. And since you'll be doing lots of sprinting, it pays off big time 

Also, and that just a me thing, never really cared for veggie soup. Can't be assed to collect the ingredients even during my Requiem playthroughs, much less so during vanilla runs where it's really not that necessary to abuse power attacks. They are pretty useful for legendary tho
            You’re going to sneak attack a dragon?
        Nice workaround if you need space but don't want pesky followers - Secret Servant from one of the Black Books
        You would just put those perks into daggers though so you’re still leveling an attacking, defensive, and sneak skill…
    > finding out the knives only kind of scale with one-handed was a bit disappointing.

But there are perks for dual wielding daggers, so you can do power attacks that are literally flashing blurs of whirling death. Every one shot an elder dragon with dual daggers? It's far far faaar more satisfying the whittling down the same dragon with arrows over the course of a half hour fight.
    Granted it does make it harder to bring a companion around, but knife assassins can be much more overpowered. 

You get a stealth/one handed berserker orc with the applicable perks and a stealth power attack and you can do thousands of points of damage, and that’s before improving the daggers, enchantments, poisons/potions, or shouts

Stealth archer is also OP but late game it pretty much requires you to have decent smithing and enchanting and takes longer to set up
    i never use companions as any type of stealth character lol
Combine this with the lucky dagger and you can even fight enemies way above your skill level
There’s really just one major problem with stealth daggers, dragons. Everything else I’m a badass assassin with full illusion magic for that sweet sweet invisibility, can one shot basically anything except for dragons which require a lot of fuckery to be able to get a backstab on. It’s a great build to ignore the main story with but man dragons got really REALLY annoying, I’m not sure if any other build has such a glaring Achilles heel.
    I would raise you mehrunes razor + blade or woe + elemental fury or slow time + poisons
        What do you mean slow time + poison? Does that effectively increase the duration/effectiveness of poison?
    Can't you just spam sneak to get the shroud proc for crits?
Resist magic caps at 85% (see ‘[Notes](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Resist_Magic)’ 😫)
    That's interesting! I've used the Shield of Solitude along with the regular Resist Magic in previous playthroughs to become, at least what I thought was immune, to magic, but maybe I was actually still taking nominal damage and didn't realize it. My current character doesn't have that much magic resistance bc I need the slots for other enchantments, but UESP is the Bible, so I'm genuinely curious now.
        Absolutely with you 100%. I‘ve spent years getting as close to 100% magic resistance as possible using potion boosted enchants and perks and i was *gutted* when i found out it caps at 85% (in the last few weeks!) 😅
            Side note you can be about 95 percent immune to magic. However, you have to cap your magic resist to 85 and then add in the mix absorb magic which I had to like 60% 
It means even if someone hits you with a spell in that 15% gap you have the absorb magic. 50% of the time will take it so it rounds it up to like 95% in total really
                Oh that’s awesome well spotted! I tend to use the Atronach perk on top of the resist magic perk + 2x potion boosted solitude resist magic enchant so… probably somewhere around 90% total?
                    Yeah there's a downside tho having magic resistance overrides the absorb so if absorb triggers you get no magic back really as your resistant to it for some reason absorb counts as damage in the numbers behind the scenes of game so your immune but also to your own spells like shield ect
                        If you want, you can farm restoration to pick the perk to get effects against undead +50%, then become a Vampire, then level Alteration for the 30% spell absorption, then get the autronach stone, and you'll have 100% magic absorption(which does not cap at 80 or 90 but actually at 100%) which means not only are you immune to magic but actually absorb magicka from magic damage too. You cant cast summoning spells anymore, but who cares you're literally permanently immune to magic.
                            I never aim for absorption. I enjoy summoning Daedra and absorption can sometimes void a summoning. It’s a bug.
                                This is why you play with the unofficial patch. That bug is fixed (among others). Sad if you're on an older console with no mods.
                        Unofficial patch fixes that. But I guess people who depend on exploits don't use patches.
                            There are patches to unpatch those specific patches in the Unofficial Patch. It's patches all the way down.
                                Imagine a separate mod for each and every game bug. It would be a nightmare. So we have an unofficial patch that covers all the bugs. If you insist that a bug not be fixed, it's up to you to manage it otherwise we have a nightmare of thousands of separate mods each fixing a single bug or glitch. 

Or just don't make your character dependent on exploits and crack.
                    Magic absorb has no limit. You can get it to 100% and actually be immune to everything except physical weapon damage. 

If you want to stick with the magic resist (which comes online much earlier and easier), you can cap out your magic resist at 85%, and then cap out the elemental resist at.....75%? I don't remember. But those stack, so 85% reduction from magic resist, and then another 75% on top. So 100 damage is reduced to 15 via magic resist, and then that 15 is reduced to like 3 or 4 damage via the 75% elemental resist. Practically immune, but not quite.
                    If you want, you can farm restoration to pick the perk to get effects against undead +50%, then become a Vampire, then level Alteration for the 30% spell absorption, then get the autronach stone, and you'll have 100% magic absorption(which does not cap at 80 or 90 but actually at 100%) which means not only are you immune to magic but actually absorb magicka from magic damage too. You cant cast summoning spells anymore, but who cares you're literally permanently immune to magic.
                        Nice!
                            Pretty neat! You can still drown, but dont care about:
-dragon breath
-fire traps
-poison dart traps
-spells
-venom spits from monsters
-lava
-soul gem traps
-spriggans and mages as an entirety
-storm and flame atronachs
-Dragon Priests
-Destruction runes
Draugr Thu'ums
                                Setting out to play a vampire for the first time(!) on this playthrough so, very relevant!
                Resist Fire, Frost and Shock each also stack with magic resist and themselves cap at 85%.
        "magic resistance" and "fire/frost/shock" resistance stack, so in vanilla you can reduce magic damage from those types to 2.25% of base damage.
        There is no cap on Magic Absorption though. You can get to 100% Absorption pretty easily. Level Alteration yo 100 and grab the Atronach perk as well as the Atronach Stone. This will give you 80% which is great, but for 100% just add Miraak's Robe and either his gloves or boots. 
Alternatively you can become a Vampire, grab the Necromage perk from the Restoration tree, then grab the Atronach perk and stone for 100%.
    That’s why you health and armor buff instead. Who cares about resist magic when you can resist ANYTHING.

Then a fortify two handed piece or some destruction magic armor with 100s of fortify destruction potions and you are literally a god
Yeah that's my khajit character all he uses is his fists and super heavy armour that's enchanted so much he can barely be hurt.
 My favourite enchanted build is sword shield light armour destruction magic cost reduction to zero but weapons with absorb health and fire damage as the charge does not go down when wearing the enchanted stuff so unlimited healing plus buffing every extra skill I can sneak, one arm, health, block like the idea of my shield actually being so enchanted it can block a dragon attack.  I can still die this way but only if I mess up so still keeps so level of skill needed
    Hang on, will you clarify something?


Are you saying with destruction cost reduction, weapons with destruction style enchant will use less/no charge when being used in combat?


For example, with 50% destruction cost reduction, a sword enchanted with fire damage will use up charge at 50% speed instead of the normal rate?
        Exactly, you spend less charge when hitting with enchanted weapons depending on your appropriate magic skill and cost reduction from armor. For example, with 100% Destruction cost reduction you could use Keening, which only has one charge.
            TIL! Thank you!
Or at the very least, eliminate the weaknesses of being a Vampire so that it's all pros
Tbh enchanting was always an easy level for me because I always want to increase speech so It’s loot the place, upgrade with smithing then upgrade with enchanting until of course I get the enchanting magic items perk then I can do it however I feel. Plus it makes more money ofc when you upgrade the items. Literally anything where the chest piece has above a 400 value I just pick up and resell later when it’s decked out.
Alchemy and enchanting are insanely easy to power level and get rich off of. Within 20-30 minutes you can sit at an alchemy/enchanting shop for as long as you want, raising levels and making money infinitely. 

If you have 3-4K gold, make a handful of iron daggers, but as many soul gems as you can, enchant the daggers with banish, sell for more soul gems, repeat. Ditto for alchemy. 

You can do all this in whiterun easily
Yeah but that's kinda my point the enchanted skill let's you add become so powerful in any area but even if you ignore the skills say weapons or magic attacks or armour skills
You can still add health regen and hp up plus stamina on there own making you functionally overpowered by being so hard to kill even in rags that are enchanted
    Enchanting 100% is the biggest game changer - especially in terms of what to target early in a playthrough. It can accelerate how quickly you get everything else astronomically.
I agree I only fully invest in one crafting skill to balance the game, also good for character building
I just started a no crafting, no bartering run and it's so refreshing not having to hoard everything I come across.  

The moment I usually stop playing is when I hit 100 enchanting and make myself invincible, cause it sucks all the fun out of the game
    That’s what’s helped me enjoy the game most recently, it also puts an emphasis on completing quests for unique gear, and provides a use for a lot of gear that rarely gets used. 

For instance in a pure mage playthrough I used the necromancer amulet, archmage robes + boots, ring of the erudite, morokei, and mystic tuning gloves (for looks) and only invested in magicka to build the epitome of a glass canon, and it was a ton of fun

Melee builds are a bit harder but still doable, if I recall there’s several light and heavy armor sets that can reach the armor cap just with the associated light/heavy perks, damage becomes an issue but weapons like the ebony blade and bloodskaal blade make it a fun playthrough
The key to any great combat build is the crafting to support it
Not to mention that you can use it to increase other skills to 100 easier.
Completely agree that blacksmithing Is amazing.
However in pure  DPS or tank enchanted makes you more of a tank even in rags if you wanted and I can make my fists hit harder then any Warhammer 👍
    Sadly thats not true. Melee weapons will always out damage fists since they not only have enchantments that multiply damage instead of add it, you can also increase their damage with black smithing. Fists only have the ability to add damage with fortify unarmed, and only get a max of ~18 from the firsts if steel perk
        O crap your right, that's a heavy armour perk that makes them so strong not played a fists build in forever
            Its possible to get your fist damage super high using the fortify restoration loop, but just playing without it melee weapons shine more. Also the ability to enchant melee weapons make their damage go even higher. I will agree enchanting is still stronger, since you can get some amazing enchantments, like magic resist and magick cost reduction
It's the two together. They're totally complimentary. An early game loop for me is to hit Dwemer dungeons. Collect lots of Dwarven scrap to make Dwarven arrows and bows. Collect lots of soul gems from the automatons, and fill them up with Falmer souls, then enchant the bows.
I think it depends where/when you’re at in the game. My first ever play through in November 2011 I got *really* into crafting right away and got ridiculously overpowered as a result very quickly. Later in the game sneak and enchanting became a lot more important.
    Honestly, its more warped by my experiences with legendary difficulty. The three best skills are easily enchanting, black smithing, and alchemy, cause of how they can loop together, and out of the three, smithing can be the hardest to live without. Enchanting lets you reach completely new peaks once maxed out, but smithing is a requirement for any build with armor or weapons
        Yeah that’s fair. And lord knows how many times I’ve played through, at this point I’m sure you’re in the same boat too. Probably depends on play style as well.
            Yea, a full spell caster wont have any use for blacksmithing since they rely on the flesh spells for their defense. Oh yea, another thing that makes enchantment less necessary is cause you can technically reach max magic resistance or max magic absorb without any enchantments. You can have max magic def and max regular defense without ever touching enchanting
One handed dual wielding!
    My next character will probably be dual axe build.
        Add Orc to that build and you'll be unstoppable.
            Make it a Breton and he can tank all the wizards you can throw at him.
        Classic Norseman raider
            He's going to be a Redguard. All planned out.
This is the one. If you max out this skill the game becomes INCREDIBLY boring. All you do is turn a whole dungeon into a frenzy and they all kill each other or you can make them all calm and walk right past them. Add in muffle and invisibility and you don’t have to take anything seriously.
    I find it much less boring than mashing the attack button constantly until you get repetitive stress injury in your fingers. I fail to understand while people think this is the more interesting way to play.
        This is why I hate dungeons. I will only play one-handed, though. A shield and an axe are all a Norseman needs.
Illusion is the way. It's quick to master, the spells are cheap, and you can train while you walk around, while you grab ingredients, while you get back from the mine to the city. Muffle and Invisibility are self cast, so you don't need a target or enemy.

With Master Illusion you can play the entire game with 0 equipment, no weapons, and not be touched by anything. No need to manage Magicka, no need to run from enemies, no need for potions.

Harmony have a huge area of effect and works behind walls, doors, whatever is in your way. Cast it on the wilderness and every animal around is friendly. On a cave, everything on the cave is friendly (even vampires). When the Magicka restores just cast again.

The problem with Harmony is the 4-5 seconds cast time. Use Become Ethereal first, and you are untouchable. Only dragons are safe from you, and they are the only thing you have to fear.
    Plus four named bosses. Harkon, Kaarstag, Ebony Punk, and Miraak.
        Kaarstag is vulnerable to Pacify. Never tried talking to the other three, but I will know in a few days, or weeks.
    This has gotta be the most boring sounding playthrough I’ve heard so far. Lol just running through the game hiding from enemies and not fighting anyone?
        It's a peaceful life...
I love Illusion. One of my latest characters is a stealth mage. Illusion + Sneak + Destruction with a minor in Conjuration. It's hilarious to watch the affects of illusion spells or to simply muffle + invisibility then ghost right through crowds of enemies

Try Mayhem in Riften (market or thieves guild) or at the peace meeting (high Hrothgar). Hysterical
Yeah but all those points in illusion and I can use any spell from illusion for free if I want to from my enchanting even the master level because it's very easy to level up if you're using the very highest cost spells for free I can't see it being better then enchanting
    You can use them for free, but they will not affect higher lvl npcs, undead, daedra or automatons without the illusion perks 
        Yeah but casting rapid fire expert spells handles that plus neat trick if the spell doesn't work it still counts towards LV up that skill so with all the perks you can get very fast no reason I can't add them to the build but I do get your point it is hard to argue with an aoe spell that makes everyone kill each other
            With Illusion you don't need rapid fire expert spells, they are all area of effect. The Master level spell, Harmony, affect a very large area, works even behind doors, multiple levels, and lasts for an entire minute. With no enemies around, you restore your Magicka in less than a minute and can cast it again.

You don't need any gear to reduce Magicka cost, because you only need to cast it once.
    You can go to level 100 in Illusion on Dragonsreach without stepping outside and buying only Courage (novice) or Calm (adept) spells. No need to buy soul gems, no need to buy or create weapons or armor, no need to carry anything around.

With invisibility nobody sees you, with Muffle nobody hears you, with Calm/Pacify/Harmony nobody attacks you, with Frenzy/Mayhem they all kill each other while you watch on the corner, silent and invisible.

It's the only skill that makes you truly untouchable by anything but a dragon. All the others could make you unkillable at higher levels, but nothing makes you untouchable. Having fortify health, resist fire, dremora lords as friends are useful, but you still can die. Cast Muffle plus Pacify plus Invisibility and nothing harms you, not even Karstaag.

You will need something to kill the enemies, but an iron dagger while invisible does a lot of damage.
Yeah but pick pockets without the stealth skill is difficult or at least awkward however I will give it to you just taking your enemies weapons clothing is overpowered as hell
I'll never forget the first time I pickpocketed a Briarheart off of a Forsaken Briarheart.
Max pickpocket chance is 90%. You can get that with enchanting at the base level pickpocket. Which is annoying because with the enchantments the perks are basically unnecessary but you still have a huge chance to fail. With 90% I've actually failed twelve 90% in a row. Obviously 90 is high, but there's never a guarantee unless you abuse the paralyze glitch. 

I go to level 50 pick pocket for the extra pockets +100 carry weight perk then basically only use it for fun or missions and it hardly ever levels again

Don't get me wrong, pick pocket has hilarious applications and is definitely fun. It's just occasionally frustrating, and leveling feels unnecessary when you max out so early
    Ahhhh but I'm fairly sure you can only nick people's clothes with the 100 perk. Which is of course the main reason to do it. Entirety of Markarth discussing why everyone's naked this morning and if it could somehow be related to the crouching cat man that passed through yesterday.
        Lol yeah true. But I mostly use it to reverse pick pocket items. I have gotten to 100 before but I did training for the majority of those levels then slowly crawled my way to 100. I only ever bother getting above 50 for role play reasons (my thief characters) And I hate the grind or waste of gold every time. 

Lol the only perk tree I find completely useless is the lockpicking tree, but pickpocket is one of the more irritating ones for me personally. I understand not everyone feels this way. If you like it, more power to you :)
This seems so fun and I’m definitely going to try it this playthrough, I just need to level up my sneak to be able to do it mid-combat.

I already have pickpocket to 100 though, so most NPCs are currently walking around in their underwear :)
While I agree somewhat it saves more time to level enchanting to speed up everything else put some sneaky enchants on and you can be surrounded were you would be normally seen with low LV sneak you shoot up so fast it's unreal
Yeah I've gotten to something like level 97 on my current playthrough without making much of an effort, and haven't bothered getting any of the perks past about the  level 60 or 70 mark, and it's already ridiculous how much I can get away with.
I’ll also add it’s stupidly easy to level up (even without exploits).

When with Ralof or Hadvar—either in the beginning of Hellene keep before the cage gate, or at the bear—turn the difficulty to legendary, take a dagger, remove your clothes, and start sneak attacking until you reach your desired level; 60 is sufficient enough to wreck people, but you can get to 100 pretty easily, and you’ll also passively level one-handed to 30 as well.

You can do this with one handed, two handed, and even destruction and block if you’re a masochist. But sneak, for some reason or another, starts off iffy, but then you’ll be leveling up almost every single hit for most of it.
Sneak backstab the greybeards while they sit and pray. Get the 15x damage multiplier sneak perk and you level that shit like crazy.
    Oh nah I meant that enchanting is difficult to level in comparison to sneak or alchemy. Those two are super easy to get up just by playing normally. Enchanting is an active time investment and often expensive
Had to scroll too far to see this. Its not only for the potions and poisons usefulness themselves but for the ridiculous amount of money you can make. I  start every run collecting all the blue mountain flower, lavender, and hanging moss in solitude and whiterun. Put em all together and u start your playthrough already rich. Then once u get a farm or just planters its already game over. Plant Scaly Pholiota, Creep Cluster, and Mora Tapinella for infinite money.  
  
It also translates well into Enchanting and Smithing because you can buy the materials needed for powerleveling them quick.
    Boom.  I am a rich elf because of alchemy.
    It also helps that the Scaly, Creep, and Mora, on top of the money, also level up alchemy stupidly fast.

And the latest anniversary addition also added Golden Hills Plantation, which with the extort decoration addiction allows you to plant a whopping *44 plants*. If you also invest some money and resources, you can also get a steward and farm workers who’ll passively generate money every day or so and even give you some additional harvested plants.
Stealth archer + paralysis poison is pretty fun.

Without exploits you make an absurd amount of money from potions. Bootstrapping enchanting and smithing becomes trivial.
    You honestly don’t need stealth with paralysis poisons
It’s often been stated that Alchemy, Enchanting, and Smithing are like Skyrim’s triforce with the power they hold together. However, it’s the alchemy and enchanting loop where the power truly lies.

If anything, the alchemy skill tree kind of gives us all friendly reminder on how stupidly powerful potions and apothecaries would be, realistically speaking.
Care to explain a little more because I can see the enchanted bonuses and I have maxed out alchemy in many playthroughs and while some of the potions do give you incredible power more so than enchanting. They are temporary, not permanent and I'm talking obviously about not glitching the numbers in the game and keeping it standard
    They are temporary, but you can always just keep drinking more potions. Once you get a home where you can plant ingredients and the perk where you are harvesting more ingredients per node, you can make your concoctions all day long. And honestly some of the poisons you can make will just flat out delete enemies.
        See I have never really tried a game were I use this as my main skill it was always there to aid me in my enchanting breaking the game to add every magic school reduced cost to my robes ect gotta look cool if your the greatest sorcerer that can cast any spell in existence for free 🤣
            Reduced cost is great, but alchemy can increase the actual effectiveness of your spells. Why cast 10 times when you can just cast once, you know? And the two aren't mutually exclusive. I've actually never gone full alchemy either, but even dipping my toes in was a real eye opener.
                > Reduced cost is great, but alchemy can increase the actual effectiveness of your spells. 

This right here.  The main weakness in the game's magic mechanics is that skill improvement in the school results in reduction of magicka consumption to cast spells rather than enhancement of the magnitude/duration of the spell effects.  

Alchemy fills that gap, letting me cast *Thunderbolt* once for 1000 damage at some magicka cost rather than casting the same spell ten times for 100 damage each at no magicka cost.
            If you have anniversary edition alchemy has never been better since you can get a farm with 20+ plots for planting. Want to paralyze someone? Theres a potion for that, Frenzy? Potion, boost one hand? Potion, boost your armor skill? Potion, destruction not doing enough damage? Potion……. Plant some Mora topenelli, Scalia pilowhatnots and creep cluster and you’ll level up alchemy super fast and get a bunch of gold in the process
    Does your armor skill suck? Have some fortify armor skills, some healing potions, and some fortify health.


Does your weapon skill suck? Have a fortify potion for that plus a poison. Pro tip: imp stool + canis root plus nirnroot causes paralysis plus some nasty damage to health and stamina. 


Gotta pickpocket and you don't know how? Potions will help with that too. And selling to your fence? Have a barter buff.


Don't have enough magicka to cast that spell you learned? Alchemy can give you extra points and then buff your spell.


Alchemy can backfill weakness in just about any part of the game. And the potions you don't need can be converted to cash.


Once you get the inventory management figured out, it's absolutely game breaking. I play on legendary difficulty because of alchemy. 
        > Alchemy can backfill weakness in just about any part of the game. And the potions you don't need can be converted to cash.

Which also boosts your Speech skill!
    well there is a certain glitch related with fortify restoration that can make you literally god with some astronomical numbers in hp mana or weapon damage( but without glitches its also decent enough to make some upgrades too )
I hit 100 in Alchemy in each playthrough, it is very easy to max it. I love my 130% boost to Smithing potion, lets me turn a pair of gauntlets with 15 armor into gauntlets with 70 armor. I have characters with 100 alchemy, 100 smithing & 100 enchanting = so many dead enemies! Alchemy starts it off and finances all the rest.

If I need more perk points then I make Alchemy legendary and VERY quickly get it back to 100.
Totally agree, this is one of my favourite builds. An unlimited stream of dremora lords will eventually take down anything while you chill, and for extra fun and games you can reanimate people for shits and giggles. Lot of fun to kill a bandit, then reanimate him to fight their former friends. And it’s all innate to the character; if you ever get your stuff taken (like that one jail mission) it barely slows you down. Oh no, big tough guy with gauntlets is blocking the way? My demon summon with a sword disagrees. Oh and you’re now my permanent corpse ally till i get sick of you.
Yeah I thought sneak but needs archery or swords skills leveled and of course with enchanting you can make sneak better then with the skill points put in mostly it's why I'm struggling to find something better
    Very true. I want to get my enchanting up fast on the character I currently play. What is the best way to do this in your experience? I'm just struggling with the huge money required for soul gems and being early on in the game without much money.
Ok that sounds amazing to play but gotta wonder how that would stand up to the enchanted absorb build every hit gets my hp and stamina back hell if on daggers the DPS is a monster , would be a cool fight the master ranged poisoner Vs the close range lifesteal . Does spell resistance work on posions or absorb spells??
    No, fire/frost/shock/magic resistance does nothing against poison, that's why there's specifically a resist poison enchantment, but even with maxed enchanting, it's pretty difficult to make it noteworthy. I've played Skyrim since it's inception and from a vanilla standpoint, and I've never seen it go much higher than 15%, which doesn't help when you've been hit by a poison that paralyzed you and drains x amount of health per second. Then I can just finish you off with my sword if the poison fails to kill you outright.

I could be wrong about the resist poison percentage though. It's just such a useless enchantment to apply on anything because so few enemies use it. I think off the top of my head, it's just things like Falmer and Chaurus. Nothing else in the game really does poison damage iirc.
How do you power level conjuration that fast/early??
    Create character, grab mage stone, go straight to whiterun, get soul trap, find or create a dead body, spam soul trap. Wait 1 hr when u run out of magicka, repeat.
Not everyone wants to play on baby mode. If the gameplay loop feels like a grind why play?
I always get it to level 50 before i ever go to the flagon since everyone carries gems and jewelry
Just YouTube fortify restoration glitch
When I say a God I mean instant death to anyone hostile with the Alchemy Restoration loop exploit, using Fortify destruction potion with a cloak spell.
I actually prefer daggers not having their own branch since it means more perks for other skills. The trade off for an assassin is having to level an attacking skill, a defensive skill AND the sneak skill.

And for the companions, yeah that's why I don't run with them on my sneak builds. A lot of micromanagement needed for that
    If you were interested in daggers though, download Ordinator for those sweet dagger perks.

Download NFF (Nether's Follower Framework) so you get a power that acts as a menu to command followers. You can tell them to stop following you from a distance instead of having to walk up to each individual. And if having 10 followers isn't your thing, you can set a hard cap to whatever you want. Seriously, there are so many awesome things about NFF, I can't believe I just discovered it like three weeks ago.
    Daggers do have perks. Besides the backstabs, there is Dual Flurry and Dual Savagery. Plus other perks that apply to daggers, such as Armsman. 

Also, good assassins don't need defense skills. Just saying.
        Those are just one handed perks, that apply to every weapon. They aren't dagger perks.

Also, light armor grants you 50% stam regen at level 60, which is kinda huge.
            But the speed of daggers is what makes it worthwhile. Dual wielding swords just doesn't compare to dual wielding daggers. 

Also, a single bowl of veggie soup gives you all the stamina you need for five minutes. You only need ONE stamina point to do a power attack, after all. And one stamina gained per second means you have five minutes worth of non-stop power attacks.
                For the first part, you could have a dagger in left hand and mace in the other hand for max dps at the same attack speed, so then those skills become dagger/mace skills following that logic :P

But yeah, the veggie soup is good for PA but not so good for sprinting so stam regen still helps. And since you'll be doing lots of sprinting, it pays off big time 

Also, and that just a me thing, never really cared for veggie soup. Can't be assed to collect the ingredients even during my Requiem playthroughs, much less so during vanilla runs where it's really not that necessary to abuse power attacks. They are pretty useful for legendary tho
        You’re going to sneak attack a dragon?
    Nice workaround if you need space but don't want pesky followers - Secret Servant from one of the Black Books
    You would just put those perks into daggers though so you’re still leveling an attacking, defensive, and sneak skill…
> finding out the knives only kind of scale with one-handed was a bit disappointing.

But there are perks for dual wielding daggers, so you can do power attacks that are literally flashing blurs of whirling death. Every one shot an elder dragon with dual daggers? It's far far faaar more satisfying the whittling down the same dragon with arrows over the course of a half hour fight.
Granted it does make it harder to bring a companion around, but knife assassins can be much more overpowered. 

You get a stealth/one handed berserker orc with the applicable perks and a stealth power attack and you can do thousands of points of damage, and that’s before improving the daggers, enchantments, poisons/potions, or shouts

Stealth archer is also OP but late game it pretty much requires you to have decent smithing and enchanting and takes longer to set up
i never use companions as any type of stealth character lol
I would raise you mehrunes razor + blade or woe + elemental fury or slow time + poisons
    What do you mean slow time + poison? Does that effectively increase the duration/effectiveness of poison?
Can't you just spam sneak to get the shroud proc for crits?
That's interesting! I've used the Shield of Solitude along with the regular Resist Magic in previous playthroughs to become, at least what I thought was immune, to magic, but maybe I was actually still taking nominal damage and didn't realize it. My current character doesn't have that much magic resistance bc I need the slots for other enchantments, but UESP is the Bible, so I'm genuinely curious now.
    Absolutely with you 100%. I‘ve spent years getting as close to 100% magic resistance as possible using potion boosted enchants and perks and i was *gutted* when i found out it caps at 85% (in the last few weeks!) 😅
        Side note you can be about 95 percent immune to magic. However, you have to cap your magic resist to 85 and then add in the mix absorb magic which I had to like 60% 
It means even if someone hits you with a spell in that 15% gap you have the absorb magic. 50% of the time will take it so it rounds it up to like 95% in total really
            Oh that’s awesome well spotted! I tend to use the Atronach perk on top of the resist magic perk + 2x potion boosted solitude resist magic enchant so… probably somewhere around 90% total?
                Yeah there's a downside tho having magic resistance overrides the absorb so if absorb triggers you get no magic back really as your resistant to it for some reason absorb counts as damage in the numbers behind the scenes of game so your immune but also to your own spells like shield ect
                    If you want, you can farm restoration to pick the perk to get effects against undead +50%, then become a Vampire, then level Alteration for the 30% spell absorption, then get the autronach stone, and you'll have 100% magic absorption(which does not cap at 80 or 90 but actually at 100%) which means not only are you immune to magic but actually absorb magicka from magic damage too. You cant cast summoning spells anymore, but who cares you're literally permanently immune to magic.
                        I never aim for absorption. I enjoy summoning Daedra and absorption can sometimes void a summoning. It’s a bug.
                            This is why you play with the unofficial patch. That bug is fixed (among others). Sad if you're on an older console with no mods.
                    Unofficial patch fixes that. But I guess people who depend on exploits don't use patches.
                        There are patches to unpatch those specific patches in the Unofficial Patch. It's patches all the way down.
                            Imagine a separate mod for each and every game bug. It would be a nightmare. So we have an unofficial patch that covers all the bugs. If you insist that a bug not be fixed, it's up to you to manage it otherwise we have a nightmare of thousands of separate mods each fixing a single bug or glitch. 

Or just don't make your character dependent on exploits and crack.
                Magic absorb has no limit. You can get it to 100% and actually be immune to everything except physical weapon damage. 

If you want to stick with the magic resist (which comes online much earlier and easier), you can cap out your magic resist at 85%, and then cap out the elemental resist at.....75%? I don't remember. But those stack, so 85% reduction from magic resist, and then another 75% on top. So 100 damage is reduced to 15 via magic resist, and then that 15 is reduced to like 3 or 4 damage via the 75% elemental resist. Practically immune, but not quite.
                If you want, you can farm restoration to pick the perk to get effects against undead +50%, then become a Vampire, then level Alteration for the 30% spell absorption, then get the autronach stone, and you'll have 100% magic absorption(which does not cap at 80 or 90 but actually at 100%) which means not only are you immune to magic but actually absorb magicka from magic damage too. You cant cast summoning spells anymore, but who cares you're literally permanently immune to magic.
                    Nice!
                        Pretty neat! You can still drown, but dont care about:
-dragon breath
-fire traps
-poison dart traps
-spells
-venom spits from monsters
-lava
-soul gem traps
-spriggans and mages as an entirety
-storm and flame atronachs

-Destruction runes
Draugr Thu'ums
                            Setting out to play a vampire for the first time(!) on this playthrough so, very relevant!
            Resist Fire, Frost and Shock each also stack with magic resist and themselves cap at 85%.
    "magic resistance" and "fire/frost/shock" resistance stack, so in vanilla you can reduce magic damage from those types to 2.25% of base damage.
    There is no cap on Magic Absorption though. You can get to 100% Absorption pretty easily. Level Alteration yo 100 and grab the Atronach perk as well as the Atronach Stone. This will give you 80% which is great, but for 100% just add Miraak's Robe and either his gloves or boots. 
Alternatively you can become a Vampire, grab the Necromage perk from the Restoration tree, then grab the Atronach perk and stone for 100%.
That’s why you health and armor buff instead. Who cares about resist magic when you can resist ANYTHING.

Then a fortify two handed piece or some destruction magic armor with 100s of fortify destruction potions and you are literally a god
Hang on, will you clarify something?


Are you saying with destruction cost reduction, weapons with destruction style enchant will use less/no charge when being used in combat?


For example, with 50% destruction cost reduction, a sword enchanted with fire damage will use up charge at 50% speed instead of the normal rate?
    Exactly, you spend less charge when hitting with enchanted weapons depending on your appropriate magic skill and cost reduction from armor. For example, with 100% Destruction cost reduction you could use Keening, which only has one charge.
        TIL! Thank you!
Enchanting 100% is the biggest game changer - especially in terms of what to target early in a playthrough. It can accelerate how quickly you get everything else astronomically.
That’s what’s helped me enjoy the game most recently, it also puts an emphasis on completing quests for unique gear, and provides a use for a lot of gear that rarely gets used. 

For instance in a pure mage playthrough I used the necromancer amulet, archmage robes + boots, ring of the erudite, morokei, and mystic tuning gloves (for looks) and only invested in magicka to build the epitome of a glass canon, and it was a ton of fun

Melee builds are a bit harder but still doable, if I recall there’s several light and heavy armor sets that can reach the armor cap just with the associated light/heavy perks, damage becomes an issue but weapons like the ebony blade and bloodskaal blade make it a fun playthrough
Sadly thats not true. Melee weapons will always out damage fists since they not only have enchantments that multiply damage instead of add it, you can also increase their damage with black smithing. Fists only have the ability to add damage with fortify unarmed, and only get a max of ~18 from the firsts if steel perk
    O crap your right, that's a heavy armour perk that makes them so strong not played a fists build in forever
        Its possible to get your fist damage super high using the fortify restoration loop, but just playing without it melee weapons shine more. Also the ability to enchant melee weapons make their damage go even higher. I will agree enchanting is still stronger, since you can get some amazing enchantments, like magic resist and magick cost reduction
Honestly, its more warped by my experiences with legendary difficulty. The three best skills are easily enchanting, black smithing, and alchemy, cause of how they can loop together, and out of the three, smithing can be the hardest to live without. Enchanting lets you reach completely new peaks once maxed out, but smithing is a requirement for any build with armor or weapons
    Yeah that’s fair. And lord knows how many times I’ve played through, at this point I’m sure you’re in the same boat too. Probably depends on play style as well.
        Yea, a full spell caster wont have any use for blacksmithing since they rely on the flesh spells for their defense. Oh yea, another thing that makes enchantment less necessary is cause you can technically reach max magic resistance or max magic absorb without any enchantments. You can have max magic def and max regular defense without ever touching enchanting
My next character will probably be dual axe build.
    Add Orc to that build and you'll be unstoppable.
        Make it a Breton and he can tank all the wizards you can throw at him.
    Classic Norseman raider
        He's going to be a Redguard. All planned out.
I find it much less boring than mashing the attack button constantly until you get repetitive stress injury in your fingers. I fail to understand while people think this is the more interesting way to play.
    This is why I hate dungeons. I will only play one-handed, though. A shield and an axe are all a Norseman needs.
Plus four named bosses. Harkon, Kaarstag, Ebony Punk, and Miraak.
    Kaarstag is vulnerable to Pacify. Never tried talking to the other three, but I will know in a few days, or weeks.
This has gotta be the most boring sounding playthrough I’ve heard so far. Lol just running through the game hiding from enemies and not fighting anyone?
    It's a peaceful life...
You can use them for free, but they will not affect higher lvl npcs, undead, daedra or automatons without the illusion perks 
    Yeah but casting rapid fire expert spells handles that plus neat trick if the spell doesn't work it still counts towards LV up that skill so with all the perks you can get very fast no reason I can't add them to the build but I do get your point it is hard to argue with an aoe spell that makes everyone kill each other
        With Illusion you don't need rapid fire expert spells, they are all area of effect. The Master level spell, Harmony, affect a very large area, works even behind doors, multiple levels, and lasts for an entire minute. With no enemies around, you restore your Magicka in less than a minute and can cast it again.

You don't need any gear to reduce Magicka cost, because you only need to cast it once.
You can go to level 100 in Illusion on Dragonsreach without stepping outside and buying only Courage (novice) or Calm (adept) spells. No need to buy soul gems, no need to buy or create weapons or armor, no need to carry anything around.

With invisibility nobody sees you, with Muffle nobody hears you, with Calm/Pacify/Harmony nobody attacks you, with Frenzy/Mayhem they all kill each other while you watch on the corner, silent and invisible.

It's the only skill that makes you truly untouchable by anything but a dragon. All the others could make you unkillable at higher levels, but nothing makes you untouchable. Having fortify health, resist fire, dremora lords as friends are useful, but you still can die. Cast Muffle plus Pacify plus Invisibility and nothing harms you, not even Karstaag.

You will need something to kill the enemies, but an iron dagger while invisible does a lot of damage.
Ahhhh but I'm fairly sure you can only nick people's clothes with the 100 perk. Which is of course the main reason to do it. Entirety of Markarth discussing why everyone's naked this morning and if it could somehow be related to the crouching cat man that passed through yesterday.
    Lol yeah true. But I mostly use it to reverse pick pocket items. I have gotten to 100 before but I did training for the majority of those levels then slowly crawled my way to 100. I only ever bother getting above 50 for role play reasons (my thief characters) And I hate the grind or waste of gold every time. 

Lol the only perk tree I find completely useless is the lockpicking tree, but pickpocket is one of the more irritating ones for me personally. I understand not everyone feels this way. If you like it, more power to you :)
Oh nah I meant that enchanting is difficult to level in comparison to sneak or alchemy. Those two are super easy to get up just by playing normally. Enchanting is an active time investment and often expensive
Boom.  I am a rich elf because of alchemy.
It also helps that the Scaly, Creep, and Mora, on top of the money, also level up alchemy stupidly fast.

And the latest anniversary addition also added Golden Hills Plantation, which with the extort decoration addiction allows you to plant a whopping *44 plants*. If you also invest some money and resources, you can also get a steward and farm workers who’ll passively generate money every day or so and even give you some additional harvested plants.
You honestly don’t need stealth with paralysis poisons
They are temporary, but you can always just keep drinking more potions. Once you get a home where you can plant ingredients and the perk where you are harvesting more ingredients per node, you can make your concoctions all day long. And honestly some of the poisons you can make will just flat out delete enemies.
    See I have never really tried a game were I use this as my main skill it was always there to aid me in my enchanting breaking the game to add every magic school reduced cost to my robes ect gotta look cool if your the greatest sorcerer that can cast any spell in existence for free 🤣
        Reduced cost is great, but alchemy can increase the actual effectiveness of your spells. Why cast 10 times when you can just cast once, you know? And the two aren't mutually exclusive. I've actually never gone full alchemy either, but even dipping my toes in was a real eye opener.
            > Reduced cost is great, but alchemy can increase the actual effectiveness of your spells. 

This right here.  The main weakness in the game's magic mechanics is that skill improvement in the school results in reduction of magicka consumption to cast spells rather than enhancement of the magnitude/duration of the spell effects.  

Alchemy fills that gap, letting me cast *Thunderbolt* once for 1000 damage at some magicka cost rather than casting the same spell ten times for 100 damage each at no magicka cost.
        If you have anniversary edition alchemy has never been better since you can get a farm with 20+ plots for planting. Want to paralyze someone? Theres a potion for that, Frenzy? Potion, boost one hand? Potion, boost your armor skill? Potion, destruction not doing enough damage? Potion……. Plant some Mora topenelli, Scalia pilowhatnots and creep cluster and you’ll level up alchemy super fast and get a bunch of gold in the process
Does your armor skill suck? Have some fortify armor skills, some healing potions, and some fortify health.


Does your weapon skill suck? Have a fortify potion for that plus a poison. Pro tip: imp stool + canis root plus nirnroot causes paralysis plus some nasty damage to health and stamina. 


Gotta pickpocket and you don't know how? Potions will help with that too. And selling to your fence? Have a barter buff.


Don't have enough magicka to cast that spell you learned? Alchemy can give you extra points and then buff your spell.


Alchemy can backfill weakness in just about any part of the game. And the potions you don't need can be converted to cash.


Once you get the inventory management figured out, it's absolutely game breaking. I play on legendary difficulty because of alchemy. 
    > Alchemy can backfill weakness in just about any part of the game. And the potions you don't need can be converted to cash.

Which also boosts your Speech skill!
well there is a certain glitch related with fortify restoration that can make you literally god with some astronomical numbers in hp mana or weapon damage( but without glitches its also decent enough to make some upgrades too )
Very true. I want to get my enchanting up fast on the character I currently play. What is the best way to do this in your experience? I'm just struggling with the huge money required for soul gems and being early on in the game without much money.

If you insist that a bug not be fixed, it's up to you to manage it otherwise we have a nightmare of thousands of separate mods each fixing a single bug or glitch.

Exactly, you spend less charge when hitting with enchanted weapons depending on your appropriate magic skill and cost reduction from armor. For example, with 100% Destruction cost reduction you could use Keening, which only has one charge.
    TIL! Thank you!
O crap your right, that's a heavy armour perk that makes them so strong not played a fists build in forever
    Its possible to get your fist damage super high using the fortify restoration loop, but just playing without it melee weapons shine more. Also the ability to enchant melee weapons make their damage go even higher. I will agree enchanting is still stronger, since you can get some amazing enchantments, like magic resist and magick cost reduction
Yeah that’s fair. And lord knows how many times I’ve played through, at this point I’m sure you’re in the same boat too. Probably depends on play style as well.

You can have max magic def and max regular defense without ever touching enchanting
Add Orc to that build and you'll be unstoppable.
    Make it a Breton and he can tank all the wizards you can throw at him.
Classic Norseman raider
    He's going to be a Redguard. All planned out.
This is why I hate dungeons. I will only play one-handed, though. A shield and an axe are all a Norseman needs.
Kaarstag is vulnerable to Pacify. Never tried talking to the other three, but I will know in a few days, or weeks.
It's a peaceful life...
Yeah but casting rapid fire expert spells handles that plus neat trick if the spell doesn't work it still counts towards LV up that skill so with all the perks you can get very fast no reason I can't add them to the build but I do get your point it is hard to argue with an aoe spell that makes everyone kill each other
    With Illusion you don't need rapid fire expert spells, they are all area of effect. The Master level spell, Harmony, affect a very large area, works even behind doors, multiple levels, and lasts for an entire minute. With no enemies around, you restore your Magicka in less than a minute and can cast it again.

You don't need any gear to reduce Magicka cost, because you only need to cast it once.
Lol yeah true. But I mostly use it to reverse pick pocket items. I have gotten to 100 before but I did training for the majority of those levels then slowly crawled my way to 100. I only ever bother getting above 50 for role play reasons (my thief characters) And I hate the grind or waste of gold every time. 

Lol the only perk tree I find completely useless is the lockpicking tree, but pickpocket is one of the more irritating ones for me personally. I understand not everyone feels this way. If you like it, more power to you :)
See I have never really tried a game were I use this as my main skill it was always there to aid me in my enchanting breaking the game to add every magic school reduced cost to my robes ect gotta look cool if your the greatest sorcerer that can cast any spell in existence for free 🤣
    Reduced cost is great, but alchemy can increase the actual effectiveness of your spells. Why cast 10 times when you can just cast once, you know? And the two aren't mutually exclusive. I've actually never gone full alchemy either, but even dipping my toes in was a real eye opener.
        > Reduced cost is great, but alchemy can increase the actual effectiveness of your spells. 

This right here.  The main weakness in the game's magic mechanics is that skill improvement in the school results in reduction of magicka consumption to cast spells rather than enhancement of the magnitude/duration of the spell effects.  

Alchemy fills that gap, letting me cast *Thunderbolt* once for 1000 damage at some magicka cost rather than casting the same spell ten times for 100 damage each at no magicka cost.
    If you have anniversary edition alchemy has never been better since you can get a farm with 20+ plots for planting. Want to paralyze someone? Theres a potion for that, Frenzy? Potion, boost one hand? Potion, boost your armor skill? Potion, destruction not doing enough damage? Potion……. Plant some Mora topenelli, Scalia pilowhatnots and creep cluster and you’ll level up alchemy super fast and get a bunch of gold in the process
> Alchemy can backfill weakness in just about any part of the game. And the potions you don't need can be converted to cash.

Which also boosts your Speech skill!
Those are just one handed perks, that apply to every weapon. They aren't dagger perks.

Also, light armor grants you 50% stam regen at level 60, which is kinda huge.
    But the speed of daggers is what makes it worthwhile. Dual wielding swords just doesn't compare to dual wielding daggers. 

Also, a single bowl of veggie soup gives you all the stamina you need for five minutes. You only need ONE stamina point to do a power attack, after all. And one stamina gained per second means you have five minutes worth of non-stop power attacks.
        For the first part, you could have a dagger in left hand and mace in the other hand for max dps at the same attack speed, so then those skills become dagger/mace skills following that logic :P

But yeah, the veggie soup is good for PA but not so good for sprinting so stam regen still helps. And since you'll be doing lots of sprinting, it pays off big time 

Also, and that just a me thing, never really cared for veggie soup. Can't be assed to collect the ingredients even during my Requiem playthroughs, much less so during vanilla runs where it's really not that necessary to abuse power attacks. They are pretty useful for legendary tho
You’re going to sneak attack a dragon?
Side note you can be about 95 percent immune to magic. However, you have to cap your magic resist to 85 and then add in the mix absorb magic which I had to like 60% 
It means even if someone hits you with a spell in that 15% gap you have the absorb magic. 50% of the time will take it so it rounds it up to like 95% in total really
    Oh that’s awesome well spotted! I tend to use the Atronach perk on top of the resist magic perk + 2x potion boosted solitude resist magic enchant so… probably somewhere around 90% total?
        Yeah there's a downside tho having magic resistance overrides the absorb so if absorb triggers you get no magic back really as your resistant to it for some reason absorb counts as damage in the numbers behind the scenes of game so your immune but also to your own spells like shield ect
            If you want, you can farm restoration to pick the perk to get effects against undead +50%, then become a Vampire, then level Alteration for the 30% spell absorption, then get the autronach stone, and you'll have 100% magic absorption(which does not cap at 80 or 90 but actually at 100%) which means not only are you immune to magic but actually absorb magicka from magic damage too. You cant cast summoning spells anymore, but who cares you're literally permanently immune to magic.
                I never aim for absorption. I enjoy summoning Daedra and absorption can sometimes void a summoning. It’s a bug.
                    This is why you play with the unofficial patch. That bug is fixed (among others). Sad if you're on an older console with no mods.
            Unofficial patch fixes that. But I guess people who depend on exploits don't use patches.
                There are patches to unpatch those specific patches in the Unofficial Patch. It's patches all the way down.
                    Imagine a separate mod for each and every game bug. It would be a nightmare. So we have an unofficial patch that covers all the bugs. If you insist that a bug not be fixed, it's up to you to manage it otherwise we have a nightmare of thousands of separate mods each fixing a single bug or glitch. 

Or just don't make your character dependent on exploits and crack.
        Magic absorb has no limit. You can get it to 100% and actually be immune to everything except physical weapon damage. 

If you want to stick with the magic resist (which comes online much earlier and easier), you can cap out your magic resist at 85%, and then cap out the elemental resist at.....75%? I don't remember. But those stack, so 85% reduction from magic resist, and then another 75% on top. So 100 damage is reduced to 15 via magic resist, and then that 15 is reduced to like 3 or 4 damage via the 75% elemental resist. Practically immune, but not quite.
        If you want, you can farm restoration to pick the perk to get effects against undead +50%, then become a Vampire, then level Alteration for the 30% spell absorption, then get the autronach stone, and you'll have 100% magic absorption(which does not cap at 80 or 90 but actually at 100%) which means not only are you immune to magic but actually absorb magicka from magic damage too. You cant cast summoning spells anymore, but who cares you're literally permanently immune to magic.
            Nice!
                Pretty neat! You can still drown, but dont care about:
-dragon breath
-fire traps
-poison dart traps
-spells
-venom spits from monsters
-lava
-soul gem traps
-spriggans and mages as an entirety
-storm and flame atronachs
-Dragon Priests
-Destruction runes
Draugr Thu'ums
                    Setting out to play a vampire for the first time(!) on this playthrough so, very relevant!
    Resist Fire, Frost and Shock each also stack with magic resist and themselves cap at 85%.
TIL! Thank you!
Its possible to get your fist damage super high using the fortify restoration loop, but just playing without it melee weapons shine more. Also the ability to enchant melee weapons make their damage go even higher. I will agree enchanting is still stronger, since you can get some amazing enchantments, like magic resist and magick cost reduction
Yea, a full spell caster wont have any use for blacksmithing since they rely on the flesh spells for their defense.
