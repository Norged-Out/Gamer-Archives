[[What race has the worst special ability]]


For me it‘s gotta be the Argonians being able to breath under water cause it just never really  comes in handy for any mission.


Argonians also get one free heal a day, along with being able to breathe underwater.

That's the race I use lol. You find some random stuff in water too
    Argonians also get claws even though it’s not listed, so you start with your unarmed being stronger than iron swords lol
        Wtf I didn't know this. I don't use mods is this in the base game??????
            Yes. Argonian Claws only do 10 damage (basic unarmed strike only does 5 at most, without power attacking, and yes it is in base game. Khajiit's Racial Ability is "Claws" and their Claws do 15 points of damage. Also, when you power-attack with Khajiit claws the damage is multiplied by 2.5 instead of just a x2 multiplier.
                You forgot nightvision for khajits, friend. Me thinks it is very handy sometimes… although me prefers the warmth of a torch in this cold bitten land.
                    May you walk on warm sands.
                        Brrrrr, this place is freezing… this one thinks he needs an extra fur, while wearing 4 already… 

(T-shirt, jersey and jacket all at once indoors and still getting chills, for real… and no I’m not khajit IRL)
                            Darnit, I was going to say I have coins for your wares.
                                Khajit has no wares, the nords bought everything… and threatened to turn this one into a rug. This one thought ”No thank you.”
                            The cold never bothered me anyway!
                    I wish the night vision was better. For me it almost never actually helps me see anything it just washes out the color.
                        The natural vision of khajit is good, but could be better. This one thinks the warmth of a torch is good when out there, but when sneaking by enemies, the nightvision is very useful, although a bit… dark too. It is what it is, this one wishes he could modify it but natural things are what they are meant to be, yes?
                        It used to be very useful on Morrowind and Oblivion, but Skyrim has all caves anf dungeons with good illumination
                    No, I did not forget that. Night Eye is the Racial POWER not ability. Racial Abilities are static (meaning they are always on) while the Racial Power has to be activated, just like Shouts have to be activated.
                I'm pretty sure it's displayed as 15 damage for Khajiits in-game, but you actually do 12 damage. Also basic unarmed is 4 damage.
This is the page on it: https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unarmed_Combat
                    No, you actually do 15 points of damage, like the ability says. I am pretty sure the basic punch does five damage, not four.
                        >†The in-game text states that the Claws passive ability adds 15 points to Khajiits' unarmed damage, but the actual effect magnitude is 12. The game data also describes the effect as "Khajiit claws do four times the damage of a man's punch", which is incorrect, as it is actually 5.5 times the damage.
                Oh man got to love a PunchCat playthrough.
                Gotta love a racial that incentivizes avoiding gaining xp from early fights.
            they're spreading minor misinformation but not really. argonians start with beast race claws. which is 10 base unarmed damage instead of 4, but are missing the khajiit skill, which adds another 12
    Tbh, just saw “Waterbreathing” and thought they looked sick, so I picked ‘em
        i played d&d before skyrim, and knew nothing of TES when i started. i only picked argonian because i heard something about dragonborns being a thing in the game
            Skyrim was my first RPG ever over here. Before it, I played Halo, Kerbal Space Program, and Pokémon almost exclusively. 

Now I have a crippling addiction to RPGs. Gotta play New Vegas to get the DAMN SPIDERS OFF MAH SKIN
    Argonian and Khajiit also get ~~immunity~~ _resistance_ to disease in survival I think? At least being able to eat raw meat and fish.
        Argonians are 50% resistant to diseases. I remember playing a different race one time and I kept getting annoyed bc I would get vampirism almost anytime I was in combat with vampire. I didn't remember getting it as often when I played as an argonian
    One time I found a ring or helmet, can’t remember which now, that allowed you to breathe underwater forever. The playthrough was un-modded vanilla on the Switch before AE.
        Yep, you can get an amulet of water breathing and the effect is also on one of the dragon priest masks. I keep it on me at all times
            I found that amulet in Oblivion
        I did find that too you can also disenchant it and geti it to whatever you want
        That must be the helmet from Solsteim. I forgot the name of the set but it's a whole armor set with the special blue armor material.
It's locked unless you're like, level 35 or so, and you have to find the book first.
            Deathbrand Armor (made of Stalhrim). Decent suite of enchantments, but you can also use an enchanting table to put Waterbreathing on any regular helmet or necklace.
                I've still never completed the Dragonborn DLC in all this time, oof
                    I've never gone to Solstheim or whatever the island is called
        Don't remember the helmet, I remember the water walking boots on Solsthiem.

Helmet is probably from the same legendary set you can get on Solsthiem.
        Yeah, but you have to go out of your way to make sure you get one early in the game.

Due to a quirk of the shop inventory tables the breath underwater enchantment is available in shops from level 1, but then gets bumped off the table entirely when you reach level 5. It doesn't start to appear on random loot until level 40 or something, and I think it doesn't show back up in shops again until level 45 or so. I haven't looked up the exact numbers in a while. 

Either way, it is possible to have leveled up enough to bump the enchantment off the shop tables before you get to the Riverwood Trader, leading many players to never see it.

  
Which is a shame as it is very useful, and a decently valuable enchantment.  It may not be the best choice, but it is a good choice for leveling up enchantment early in the game.
        its so funny cuz its a passive effect that doesnt have a multiplier so you can disenchant it and put it on anything you want for a petty soul gem
    Plus the disease resistance ain't bad. Getting rockjoints early in a dungeon for instance can be tough in the early/mid game.
        if you have a hawk feather you can just eat it and cure all your diseases 👌🏼
            What are the odds you have a hawk feather on demand? If you're not actively spec'ing into alchemy, there aren't many that you come by easily.

There's like a 10% chance you can get them from alchemists but you only get a few at a time, so if you're not going out of your way to hunt them down you probably won't end up with many.
    I imagine swimming in survival mode makes you immediately cold as balls
        It does, especially in snowy areas. You can die from the cold while swimming in under 30 seconds unless you cast Flame Cloak or something.
        It does but only in snowy and ice areas 
I believe 90% of the players disable survival though
    Using imperious (race overhaul mod) argonians get a quest to search underwater chests to fully unlock racial bonuses and its honestly a blast haha
    And on survival mode they can eat raw meat without getting food poisoning. Same with Khajit.
    don't argonians also get a 5x multiplier (opposed to regular 2x) on their right hand unarmed power attacks if they're vampires?
    And disease resistance
    The waterbreathing isn't all that big of a deal tbh. You can achieve the same results with a potion or enchantment. There are other more useful perks for argonians though
    I *love* diving underwater in this game. Potion ingredients, shipwrecks, sunken treasure, environmental storytelling, the ability to snipe your enemies from a distance because the AI refuses to swim... It's great
    khajits should be able to toggle night vision without a timer fr
    I used to take for granted their illness invulnerability, and now every play thru i get pissed off by Ataxia. Argonians aren't half bad imo lol
    I love playing argonians - poison resistant, wolverine healing, water breathing ninjas.
The nice thing with waterbreathing is that it's a passive. I never use racial abilities because they are once per day and i fight a lot of fights in one day as my days are longer than standard.

So for me, all once-per-day abilities are sortof meh just because of their limitation of use.
    Berserker’s Rage needs that once-per day limitation because it’s already OP as it is. I’d say the most powerful/best racial ability there is
        The Argonian’s Histkin, Redguard’s Adrenaline Rush, and the High Elf’s Highborn (and the 50 bonus Magicka) are all really good as well. Especially for those sticky situations you can find yourself in early on.
            Meanwhile, me, a Khajiit:

This one can see in a dark room…
                Okay, I *literally* just found out that Night Eye is a lesser power, so it can be used multiple times a day instead of one, which is how I thought it worked. Now I need to make a Khajiit thief with that in mind
                    This one would recommend that Khajiit avoid being a thief, unless Khajiit is smarter than a nord and is not caught. Khajiit will give this one much trouble if Khajiit is caught and idiot nords tighten security.
                I don’t like the green tint of the night vision
                    Night vision was much easier to see stuff in Oblivion. I don't like it in Skyrim at all.
                    [Subtle Night Eye](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13091) fixes that.
                Punchcats are a blast to play though
            I've never played an orc in my life,  so I'm not biased, but they all pale in comparison. Double damage output and cutting damage taken in half for long enough to stomp on any enemy that doesn't decide to fuck of and fly around for a few minutes, let's you take on foes way before you have any business to under normal circumstances.
            Fun fact, Redguard's adrenaline rush's best use is for sprinting. If you make vegetable soup, you gain the passive effect "restore 1 stamina and health a second for 720 seconds" which lets you spam power attacks infinitely and faster than Adrenaline Rush would
        Orc master race
            BOC-Big Orc Cock
                You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people.
                    Khajiit is innocent of this crime!  
(Also, make a punchcat. They're fun!)
                        Reminds me of my kitty nightblade from ESO: Miouch. If I ever play that game properly, at least I don't have to waste a few hours coming up with a name.
                        I really wish they were more viable in the harder difficulties cause they are very fun
                Never should've come here!
                YOU! REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THIS REALM OF REALITY. IMMEDIATELY!
                Oho. You really shouldn’t have done that. Enjoy the view.
                Stop! You have violated the law!
        What's the point if you can just sleep the whole day with the press of a button? It's just annoying. Personally I just never used any of the abilities because of them, so that's a waste of a game mechanic.
        Yea but if you just wait for 24 hours after every big fight you'll always be so OP that nothing can stop you.
            that’s why I play on survival
        Imagine an army of beserking Orcs in heavy armor marching towards you.
    Between Oblivion and Skyrim, I've logged so much time playing as an Argonian that I *forgot* that none of the other races can breathe underwater and get annoyed when I try a play through on something else 

*"What do you mean I can't just sit at the bottom of the lake for 20 minutes while I'm looking up quest stuff on my phone?"*
    Not true. All Racial Abilities are passive. You are thinking of Racial Powers, however, the Racial Power for Khajiit (Night Eye) is unlimited times each day.
    I’ve gone argonian in my first play through when it first released and yet again all these years later.
    I'm curious; what do you think about Dragon Aspect? IMO it's the best shout in the game (or at least one of them), but it's limited to once a day due to how powerful it is.
        I never finished the main quest because the whole dragon killer story isn't that appealing to me.  
But Dragon Aspect looks like a great and hillariously overpowered shout indeed.
            Dragon Aspect isn't from the main quest; it's from Dragonborn. Give it a shot if you haven't already.
    I agree with the, once-per-day thing. A 10 minute cool down would be enough for most effects to stop over use and even then I probably wouldn't use them.
    I'm using a mod to shorten it. Something like two in game hours I think. While it can be argued it's op to do that for example with the orc's ability, if you can just sleep the whole day with the press of a button anyway, then what's the point? 

The whole one per day is just a stupid bad game system. They should have made some system that would be charging based on your activities, that would make it something that you can work with. 

With the vanilla system I simply never used any of the abilities.
        Active abilities should just be a special spells that you know at start (and they should be the only spells you know at start). They should cost magicka and be balanced accordingly.

And yeah, once per day - or even worse, selecting the spells you can use when resting like in D&D - is just not a fun game mechanic.
    > The nice thing with waterbreathing is that it's a passive. 

The Argonian waterbreathing is hilarious to me because in its original incarnation in Morrowind, it was a *once per day* power. 

I think it was a power in Oblivion too? I might be wrong on that.
    > all once-per-day abilities are sortof meh just because of their limitation of use

Not really. After using it and it burns out, set your wait time to 24 hrs, and you're good to go again. It's not like you have to wait, ya know, the whole 24 hrs while still playing. Maybe a bit of a cheat, but useful.
    I've only ever used Daily powers with the Aetherial Crown or the Ring of Hircine.
As to not say night eye like every one else, I think wood elves command animal ability is up their in uselessness. It has some niche moments, but the short duration and limitation to only animals means its not gonna be useful for most fights in the game.

Also shout out to Dark elves whose special ability is just a spell anyone can cast. Yea its nice to have early game but really falls off fast
    On the other hand, when you're low level out on the plains West of Whiterun and run across  an unexpected saber cat, Command Animal is pretty damn useful.
        Also commanding mammoths to attack giants is pretty clutch early game.
        While useful, battle cry would also be useful, and wouldn't only work in that one scenario. Command animal is great for using mammoths to fight giants, but the mammoths are more useful to kill than the giants.
            Giant toes are way better than mammoth tusks
                Grand soul from mammoth and greater soul from giant
                    Ohhhh so you're an enchanter then
                Someone mentioned it, but its for the grand souls. Its the easiest enemy to find to get grand souls from, especially earlier in the game. Lster one, black souls become much easier to get
            Battle Cry only works on creatures level 6 and lower. Command Animal works on all Animals (Ice Wolf, Pit Wolf, Wolf, Sabre Cat, Snowy Sabre Cat, Cave Bear, Snowy Cave Bear, Frostbite Spider, Giant Frostbite Spider, Mammoths) Trolls are not considered animals, unfortunately.
                No, Battlecry has a Magnitude of 99, so it hits enemies up to Level 99.
        That's your problem. Saber cats/bears while exploring *should* be expected... considering that one of them is definitely around the next bend. Or under that rock. Or behind that tree. Or running at you from behind. About to take off a third of your life.

Always.
            Or on the downside of that little slope just outside Whiterun, so close you could hit the city wall with a mead bottle. Completely hidden despite the fact that little slope is barely higher than a Bosmer. Easy to avoid with experience, but a nasty shock the first time. Sometimes there's a *pair* of them there.
                Saber cats. Bears. Trolls.

They're like visa. Everywhere a low level wants to be.
    Dark elves also have fire resist.
        Yeah, that’s their main draw. Slap on that iron helm of the unburned you find in the mage’s college quest and you’re the unburninator
        I am talking about specific abilities. The fire resist is really good and the best thing they have, but their activated ability is just meh
    Watched a video recently that said for some reasons vampires are considered animals for some reason. I wonder if the wood elf abilities counts for them too!?
        it's weird - Voice of the Sky will work on some vampires, too so I guess they are animals
            Aaaand that answers why the vampires at Clavicus Vile's shrine were ignoring me just now, since I found the marker I missed on the way down from dropping off the Horn. Wild that I just stumbled across the answer.
        If they're animals why does my murder count go up when I kill them for the Dawnguard?
            Vampires are NPCs rather than creatures, I'm wondering if Voice of the Sky works because VampireFaction is considered "friendly" to wolves, skeevers and spiders? It'd be interesting to see if Kyne's Peace works too
    I nearly always play as a bosmer and just used command animal at the beginning of my current playthrough for the first time ever. I was dropped in a random location with the alternate perspectives mod and that random location was like 5 feet away from a bear. So. Thanks AP!
        One of the best use cases for it is against spriggans since it over rides their command animal and turns a hard fight into a woodland massacre
    For the most part, racial powers aren't really for "most fights in the game", they for the beginning of the game. Early on, being able to avoid fights with bears and sabre cats is very useful.
        Eh, not really. Battle cry and voice if the emperor are really good even late into the game to give you a break, and the orc's barbarian rage gets better as your level gets higher. Dragonskin is an at will 50% magic absorb, which is always going to be helpful. Highborn and histskin are super useful in a dangerous fight, and adrenaline rush is always nice to have. Night eye does help, ancestors wraith is just flame cloak, and command animal falls off in usefulness. Its too niche of an ability compared to all the other ones
    Animal allegiance/command animal was literally completely useless for me :D imagine my excitement at figuring out you can have an animal buddy (temporarily)!!

I load up the game as a wood elf only to find out command animal literally doesn’t work in my game except for as a dragon shout… a feature, not a bug!
    Dark elves have 50% fire resistance, I have an amulet that gives me 50% fire resistance. Fighting dragons is an absolute breeze because of this. My character will make the sounds as if she were being damaged, but I'll sustain no actual damage at all. It's very handy.
        You still take damage. Element and magic resistance caps at 85%, so your only taking 15% of the damage. I am also not talking about dark elves as a whole, i am talking about ancestors wraith specifically. Dark elves fire resistance is what makes them a good race
My first character was an argonian and the water breathing saved my noob ass so many times. I kept getting attacked by bears and saber cats in the early game, so I would just run to the nearest river/lake and hide out until they went away
    Ah yes, the Frog strategy
    You can run to the river as any race and cross to the other side.
        I found they would often follow me :') Sometimes swimming downriver was a nice fast escape though.
Khajiit’s “Night-Eye” or Imperial’s “Imperial Luck”.

- For former, just turn up your brightness. Skyrim is always pretty bright as is.

- For latter, 2-10 gold is practically nothing. Yes, it’s still more gold but it’s the equivalent of 10 cents more on your paycheck. You won’t even notice it. 
    Even for that, just use mage light


Imperial luck is actually bugged, and EVERY race has it, which is hilarious
        Makes sense, every race is part of the Empire
            It’d be funny if you lost it if you joined the stormcloaks
                “We’re all out luck, lads.”
            Hell yeah! Suck it Stormcloaks, LONG LIVE THE EMPIRE!!!
                Sad Ulfric noises
                    _FUS RO DAH_
                *Proceeds to assassinate the Emperor*

Problem?
            **Altmer screeching sound intensifies**
        Every race starts with imperial luck? 🤔
            Technically yes, the ability is supposed to be disabled once you leave Helgen and are not an Imperial, but due to the script function not being implemented correctly, the ability remains active.
                For the last 13 years? I know some bugs are left in intentionally but this feels like a very fixable issue.
                    Yes. Bethesda aren't interested in bug fixing, they have modders to do that for free! Then they get annoyed that people aren't paying them for these mods they didn't develop, so they release an update to break them all. This happens every few months to some degree.
        Well, the Imperials think we all fall under their laws so it's fitting in a way,
    Imperial luck is actually buggy and every race gets it. So all imperials got is voice of the emperor 
        Are you serious about Imperial Luck?
            Surprise!
                I have played Skyrim for 4 years and never knew the truth about Imperial Luck…

How many other lies have I been told by the council?
    Imperial luck more like imperial suck
    I cannot play without night eye and my brightness is maxed. Also night eye is a racial power that can be used constantly, so to me it is the absolute best racial power in the game. This post is about racial abilities though. In that case Khajiit suck because I don’t use hand to hand.
    Night Eye is the Racial Power, NOT Racial Ability.
    hard agree on the night eye perk
    >Khajiit’s “Night-Eye”

Cast magelight and face everyone head on with sword and board like a true Nord.
    Loved night eye for my stealth character
Khajiit night eye for me personally. Used it once and didn't notice a difference at all, if anything it wasn't nice to look at either, turned it off straight away. 

Just my view though.
    Their Claws ability is useful in an emergency if you get disarmed. The Night Eye, not so much.
        Aye, claws are good. Shame there wasn't an extended skill tree for melee or at least more perks. Love the idea of a khajiit monk, spin kicking a bandit in full heavy armor off of a bridge while wearing priest robes. 

Make him look like Tai Lung.
            I've always wanted to play an unarmed Khajiit and name him Mr Meowgi
                Then you know what must be done, better start creating him.
                I played an unarmed Khajiit build and named him Puunclaw. Easy early game, tough midgame, one to two hit elder dragons by endgame.
            Best one I've heard was someone who made an argonian Throws-his-fists or something like that as a pugilist build. Might do that for my next playthrough with ordinator
            Never knew that I wanted this
                Thankfully there are mods but you know, would've been cool in the vanilla game.
                    You can do it in vanilla and actually its pretty op early its like having a daedric starting weapon.
                        I think it's more than a dragon bone sword at base. But then you get Fists of Steel and those gloves from the Ratway...
                            And then the game outscales you..
            No they ain't 🤣🤣🤣🤣, 15 damage is a fucking joke and the attack speed and range is horrid, just pick up your weapon.

If you're in the early game you're trying to level up so you wanna pick em up right away, and if it's anything other than early game the damage is real bad, not useful in any situation even in the rare instances you are disarmed and can't use bound sword.
        I like using Khajiit for stealth archery because of their skill bonuses and their claws making for a good melee fallback option that doesn’t raise other combat skills. Very powerful in the early game when you don’t have many arrows too.
        No it isn't 🤣🤣🤣🤣, 22 damage is a fucking joke and the attack speed and range is horrid, just pick up your weapon.

If you're in the early game you're trying to level up so you wanna pick em up right away, and if it's anything other than early game the damage is real bad, not useful in any situation even in the rare instances you are disarmed and can't use bound sword.
            Claws adds an additional 12 (not 15) points of unarmed damage to the existing base damage of 10 unarmed. That total damage of 22 per strike is the same as the base damage of an Ebony greatsword, which is certainly not a joke weapon in an emergency.
                So I corrected that in a proper statement later but even still

Claws do 22 damage unarmed. This might seem really good early game as that's actually more than a lot of One Handed weapons, the problem with it is the attack speed and range is absolutely abysmal, you have to literally hug enemies for very slow and very short ranged attacks, even an iron sword ends up working out better since your range is longer and your attack speed in faster, so you actually end up doing more damage and more importantly on higher difficulties end up taking much less damage, which in turn let's you deal more damage. And this is just early game, obviously once you get 1-2 perks into one/two handed it's just irrelevant, and most importantly you NEVER want to use unarmed early game in anything other than brawls since you wanna level up One Handed or Two Handed or whatever and unarmed doesn't help with that. Maybe if you want to use an unarmed gimmick it might be useful, but that's purely a fun novice difficulty thing.

Khajit Claws are useless outside of brawls, which are never a real factor.
                    If you are disarmed every fight is a brawl. Look back at my first post to see the context as to when Claws is useful.
                        No, and it takes less than 15 seconds to pick up where you shouldn't be taking any damage and do vastly higher damage when you do, not to mention bound weaponry being a much better option in a pinch, also, the amount of Draugr that use Disarm is not rare at most, a bad solution for a very rare issue.
                            Look back at my first post to see the context as to when Claws is useful.
    It's worse in Oblivion. Turned everything bright blue
Like, why would I want to waste an enchantment slot with waterbreathing when I could have it passively? Exploring the ocean floor is a no go with the weak smooth-skins, but with an Argonian I can dive deep into the depth and creep myself out.

Also, my 4yo demands I swim in all the water.
[Racial Bonuses](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Races_(Skyrim))

Agonian's special power is Histskin. 10x HP Regen for 60 seconds. Water breathing is their passive. Good passive too as it frees up an enchantment slot. Also 50% Disease Resistance.

As far as Racial Specials go:
- Dunmer get shafted. Once per day flame cloak, woopdie friggin do. 
- Bosmer come in just behind them with a 60 second beast charm. Most animals that are worth charming are not within 60 seconds of anything other than other animals as powerful as they are and chances are charm will break before the fight is over. That is of course completely disregarding the fact that if you are a Bosmer you are almost guaranteed to be a stealth archer. You're not likely to bother with a pet.
- Imperials' Voice of the Emperor only lasts 30 seconds. Not terribly helpful
    Who... uses an enchantment slot for waterbreathing?

Even if you want to swim longer you might as well just pick more HP to suffocate longer?

Voice of the emperor is "calm" instead of the nord "fear". So you can pickpocket people and then scream at them when they start complaining :D
        Stealth Archers, limited number of effective head enchantments.
            Fortify archery is a head enchantment is it not?
                Yes, who in the world is shooting themselves in the foot by having only one enchantment on their gear though? Dual Enchantment perk: Archery/Waterbreathing.
            Keep a spare ring or necklace in the backpack. The overlap of situations where you need waterbreathing AND normal enchants at the same time is zero.
    Also worth noting that the shout Animal Allegiance does the same thing that the bosmer power does, so any race can do it
        And less often than the shout. Now if it was a permanent pet that would be awesome. But unfortunately you'll need a mod for that.
I actually love imperial luck (as long as you have the bug fix for it). But then I have a personal problem where I will always stop to pick up a single gold piece, no matter how much money I have.
Voice of the emperor is so stupid, honestly.

Ironically, is my favorite race lore-wise. My dragonborn is always an Imperial.
    Voice of the Emperor is the most powerful AoE calm in the game, and you can use it from the start.  It is more powerful than the level 100 Illusion Harmony spell.

There are not that many situations where you really NEED an AoE calm spell that affects everything up to level 99, but when you do, it is awesome.

Imperial Luck is of course useless, since every race gets it anyway due to a bug.  And even if it were limited to Imperials, it would still suck because a few extra gold coins just does not make that much difference long term.

I do like playing Imperials for RP purposes, though, and they make for decent paladins or spell knights with their starting skill bonuses, at least in the early game.
        This is true. I had a situation where Serana bugged out and kept killing Parthurnaxx. Beating her up didn’t work. Calm didn’t work. Voice of the Emperor? Worked like a charm. Definitely very useful situationally
            There ONLY time I used Voice of the Emperor when I was an Imperial was to stop my followers fighting each other lol
    Voice if the Emporer has gotten me out of some sticky situations.
        I wonder what the Dragonborn actually says when Voice of the Emperor is used.
            "Are we about to kiss right now?" Instantly the enemy is too uncomfortable to keep fighting.
                I do like the idea of a Dragonborn who is just so socially inept he can resolve differences for a short time.
            "Daddy chill"
            Can't we just settle this over a pint?
        Same here, especially against long-range magic users, it allows me to get into melee range without taking damage
    If you play a sneak/dagger build it's a fantastic ability, walk up to any enemy, calm them, then walk behind them and cut their throat. Most things using that build go down in one hit but if you happen to run across something that doesn't you can get one hit, use voice of the emperor and then finish them off with another sneak attack.
Underwater breathing comes in handy during a certain Thieves guild mission.

But the only good racial ability is Berserk.
    Highborn is good
        Highborn saved me from tough spots as a conjuration-destruction mage
        I use highborn to quickly level my restoration, destruction, and conjuration by summoning a mistman, then casting turn undead on it (or wrath man and chain lightning bolt)
        I love Highborn. High Elf is my go-to race for mage builds.
        The definition of a good racial ability is that it is not quickly outmoded by enchantments between level 20 and 30.

You don't need to regen your magicka if you have 100% cost reduction, which you should.

Highborn is outmoded by enchantments. Therefore Highborn does not fit this definition.

Therefore, Highborn is not good.
            Whose definition?
                Some assholes. 
                This other guy's mom's.
            More of a matter of opinion, and not to mention play style.
            Bretons passive 25% magic resist is up there then. You cannot simply replace it with enchants at lvl 30. Sure you could slot it on your gear but without being breton, youll always be using those enchants on it where a breton can use it on something else.
                You can absolutely replace Breton's magic resistance with enchantments as well as boons and the Lord or Atronach stone.
                    I strongly disagree and i use the lords stone. I get nax magic,resist with 2/3 alteration perk and mara's blessing
            >The definition of a good racial ability is that it is not quickly outmoded by enchantments between level 20 and 30.

That is a *weird* definition.  You know what else isn't quickly outmoded by enchantments?  Night Eye
                Eh, I've got magic or brightness settings for that.
                    Exactly this. Night Eye is just a technical issue.
                Hardly a weird definition. What's the point of having an ability that loses its usefulness?
            Unless you are exploiting, you can't 100% every school. Even if you just 100% your two favorite schools, Highborn never stops having a use for a pure mage character. It can essentially act as a free fast mana refill during a fight (unless you are habitually running out of mana still every fight, then a once a day quick fill isn't helpful.

Will concede that it doesn't see much at for me anymore as a pure mage at level 80, but it was worth it at low levels fighting hard enemies and it's general use makes it applicable to many situations
            I think racial abilities in general are to give you an edge early on. I will agree though that berserk rage is the best racial ability, hands down.
            >You don't need to regen your magicka if you have 100% cost reduction, which you should.

oh, my bad, didn't know a singleplayer game had rules i had to follow
                Non-sequitur is your racial ability!
I think underwater breathing is a good ability. Yeah, it's not mandatory, but the fact that it is a passive ability makes it pretty useful for the few times you need to go underwater.

As for the most useless ability? I dunno. Perhaps the Khajiit's Night Eyes?
While Skyrim doesn’t exploit underwater stuff anywhere close to Oblivion, at least it’s an always on ability, that never needs activation. I hate to join the crowd, but night eye is beyond useless.
I really wish there were actual underwater/mostly underwater areas and quests. It’d be so nice if they fleshed this out.
I didn’t notice this was the Skyrim subreddit at first and had to do a double take at the title lmao
Khajiit's night eye is actually useless. Skyrim is already pretty bright without mods, and using night eye with mods that darken the game tend to make it look fucked up. At least there are a few situations where breathing underwater can be useful.
I always loved the Argonians since they had Regen & Waterbreathing.  When i was brand new to the game, I thought Waterbreathing was awesome. 

In over my head for a fight? Time to jump in the river where they can't chase me!

Stupid Sabertooth cat sneaks up out of nowhere? (I swear the freakin SPAWN 6ft away from you sometimes) Just pop Regen and I've got a much higher chance of not being mauled to death!

I'd say the Imperials ability was the worst; find Gold easier? That's it? Seems kinda pointless when Alchemy is one of the best ways to get Money quickly (rob the Alchemist blind at night then sell all the potions you made from their ingredients the next day!).
    Jumping into the nearest body of water is also my go-to and I love playing argonian for that reason 😂
You mean the racial power or the racial active effect? 

Because if it's the power then it's between Redguard Because of vanilla stamina dynamic, Khajiit Because you can see in the dark many ways.
Water breathing at lower levels is excellent for escaping if you don't want to be bossed by a random dragon attack. Also good for exploring ship wrecks and stuff. 

Picked Argonian for the first time ever in my most recent play through and honestly it's been my favourite.

Don't love the once per day type perks, I always forget to use them.
    Also great for the Goldenglow job if you fuck up
Last years Daytona 500 was pretty shit
    Fucking lol
I love playing Imperial, but Imperial Luck is absolutely useless considering how easy it is to make money in Skyrim. Voice of the Emperor has its moments where it works if you don't touch the Illusion tree.
 Anything that you can only use once a day. I never use it for fear that I'll need it later. Useless.
Did not see subreddit before reading title and was very confused
    Quite understandable.
The khajiit and imperials. but I use imperial sometimes. The voice of the emperor is a free calm spell all the way up to level 99.
Imperial for me since “Imperial Luck” is glitched where everybody gets it so with them you only get half your racial’s while everybody else gets an extra, and while “Voice of the Emperor” is useful its not needed in most situations.

Which really sucks cuz Imperial was the first race I played in the game 😂
For me, Argonians only end up that way if I forget they can do that. Remembering they have constant passive water breathing means being able to use waterways and bodies of water as casual transportation where other species would have to use magic or walk around. Swimming about in a lake without a care for how long you’ve been under can take you from one place to another very swiftly. Using rivers as high speed roads becomes addicting, even with the danger of falling off of waterfalls. And there are so many sunken treasures out and about that you get more naturally exposed to this way.

My answer is the Dunmer Sparks spell. You get the spell book for Sparks in Helgen, so all the racial ability really means is A) you get some gold for selling the book since you can’t use it, and B) you get to cast Sparks on like, 4~6 more enemies at the start of Helgen before getting the book on another race. Not a very fulfilling feeling.
Might be Khajiit for Night Eyes.

Because while they make good Stealth Builds right away, and are the best at hand-to-hand.

Night Vision or even a torch is rarely needed. The only dark place I couldn't see were the Falmer caves after Darkfall Cave.

And I wish most caves looked as dark as those were. It felt cool to finally use Magelight or Candlelight.
I’d say that depends a lot on your playstyle. I’d personally agree with nighteye. I’ve never used it and its extremely rare that you’re someplace dark and don’t have a torch or the light spell. That said I also can’t recall what the nord ability even is and I know I’ve never used the wood elf’s animal friendship ability even after making it stronger via mods. 

Honestly I think the only truly useful abilities is the imperial charm and the argonian’s ability to swim underwater without drowning. Everything else is either too situational or gets outpaced real quickly.
Khajiits. The “night eye” doesn’t even help you see better. The claws are cool but unless you do lots of brawls they’re useless compared to weapons.
So many noob takes here...

The best races for Legendary are Breton and Orc. Breton lets you deal with mages, who otherwise blast your ass off, whereas orc lets you deal with tough physical enemies. In both cases, you would take the Lord stone.

Argonian racial passives are irrelevant. Waterbreathing is useless and the Companions chain gives you a shitton of Cure Disease potions and Hawk Feathers, which you can easily farm by just shooting or shouting at hawks in the wild. Histskin seems strong but is meh compared to both Breton and Orc.

Redguard racial is made redundant by Vegetable Soup, which is in fact better than their racial because: 1) it doesn't have a daily cooldown; 2) it doesn't have a 2-second window after spending stamina during which it doesn't regenerate. 

The wood elf racials are all terrible. What kind of beast would be so difficult for you that you decide you'd rather give up and tame it instead of killing it?

Khajiit racials are funny but bad. Unarmed builds are not viable on higher difficulties.

The imperial racials are pretty bad. The bonus 2-10 gold found is trash and the active is only useful if you end up in a room full of bandits which you can't handle. The only place where that happens is Swindler's Den, but you can just line all of them in the tunnel before the room and kill them one by one.

The same applies for Nord, although the frost res is okay vs caster draugr.

Dunmer racials are trash. Flame cloak kills your followers while being a very bad spell without Destruction perks. The fire res is situationally useful.

The only thing high elf racials are good for is a Bound Bow build because it allows you to cast the spell from the get-go, provided you can yoink it from Fort Omol without getting zapped.

So, regarding the question - it's a tough choice because basically everything besides Breton and Orc sucks ass. I guess I'll have to say Redguard because a simple household staple is better than their active, and their passive is mostly irrelevant.
    Doesn't the Dunmer fire resistence perfect counter the fire weakness from being a vampire?
        Useful as that may seem, you can just keep a fire res potion in your bags in case you face a fire mage or dragon. Basing your entire race choice just on that is... *highly unreasonable.*
Personally I think they're all sort of useless after a certain point.
It is pretty handy, TG for one, all the chests and hidden treasure in ruins... But of course it's easy enough to find a necklace or circlet for that.
Dark Elves They have a spell anyone can learn it’s only good for those of a very low level before it quickly becomes useless
I really don't find the water breathing that impressive when you can hold your breath for so long anyway
I would say red guards getting more stamina is really bad when compared to other once per day abilities like argonians regen or nord fear.

Surprised nobody mentioned them yet, they are very forgettable though.
Night Eye, because I think the discoloration often makes it harder to see despite it being brighter.
Fucking hell im glad I checked the sub when I saw this question.
For me it's got to be the argoinians' ability to cause a reddit meltdown over big titty lizards and their origins.
Least racist nord
The underwater one does help actually in the thieves guild one where SPOILERS ALET: >!You are underwater after killing mercer!<
Argonians resist disease, breathe underwater, have a power that makes you basically unkillable once per day, and have claws. I'd honestly say it's one of the best races, certainly my favorite
Argonians never have to worry about running out of air in the admittedly tiny number of times where it's relevant, unlike other races that either waste backpack space on a water breathing potion or curse themselves for not having water breathing in those rare occurrences. Situational, but handy when it comes up.

Argonians deal bonus damage with their fists, so they win every time when they brawl. Situation, but again, it's handy.

Histskin is amazing, fite me.
For me it’s between Breton, imperial, and bosmer.

Breton: magic resistant nice, but magic resistance is easy to come by via clothing or armor. Absorb Magika, this would only benefit a mage, that’s already gonna have enough magika to last. There aren’t extensive enough encounters to need absorb.

Imperial: in a 37 year old game, if you still need extra coins idk. Gold is abundant so the passive is useless. Calm kinda sucks too but maybe you might accidentally I dunno kick someone’s chicken.

Bosmer (almost always play this race): poison resistance is nice against the falmer and a couple other areas, but not necessary. Disease resistance can be a burden if you want to get sick (vampirism or lycanthropy) command animal sounds so cool until the level cap of I believe 5 means you can control like a deer.
A lot of the comments dogging on dunmers for their ancestor's wrath spell (which I've never used once) are skipping over how insanely useful the passive 50% resist fire race skill is. I have the Necklace Of Flame Suppression which increases fire resistance by 50%, making me essentially unable to receive ANY fire damage. It makes most dragon attacks (not counting frost) useless until they get on the ground. But even then, being strong, having good weapons, and good armour makes them an easy kill (fastest dragon kill once it hit the ground has been under 10 seconds).
I dunno who the worst is but i always end up playing an Orc for theirs lol. Everyone always talks about winding up a stealth archer but i always wind up being a 2h berserker lol.
wood elves special is useless even at level 1
Redguard's Adrenaline Rush and Dunmer Ancestors Wrath are actually garbage.
Probably Bosmer. Diseases are rare and easy to cure. Poison is never really much of a threat either and easy to heal through. Commanding an animal ally is also very situational and never really much help.
The absolute room temperature IQ in this sub is just absolutely astounding, from OP to almost everyone else. Either that or yall are a bunch of closet furries.

Khajit is BY FAR the worst race as far as abilities goes and it's not even close, Histskin is legit helpful, and waterbreathing has a lot of, mostly negligible, but still useful instances if you're aren't a noob like yourself OP since you obviously never explore underwater. If you're talking about overall, you could make the argument Argonians are the worse in Survival due to their cold weakness, but that's not the case and even if it was Khajits would still be a close second since at least Argonians have disease resistance. And for Imperials, Voice of the Emperor alone makes them fairly good.

Claws do 22 damage unarmed. This might seem really good early game as that's actually more than a lot of One Handed weapons, the problem with it is the attack speed and range is absolutely abysmal, you have to literally hug enemies for very slow and very short ranged attacks, even an iron sword ends up working out better since your range is longer and your attack speed in faster, so you actually end up doing more damage and more importantly on higher difficulties end up taking much less damage, which in turn let's you deal more damage. And this is just early game, obviously once you get 1-2 perks into one/two handed it's just irrelevant, and most importantly you NEVER want to use unarmed early game in anything other than brawls since you wanna level up One Handed or Two Handed or whatever and unarmed doesn't help with that. Maybe if you want to use an unarmed gimmick it might be useful, but that's purely a fun novice difficulty thing.

Night Eye is legit retarded, never has it ever been useful, you can see everything even in the darkest areas with a reasonable brightness, and if you somehow need more, you have torches, magelight and Candlelight, and Flames spell themselves are great for lighting up the dark and that's a base spell. Completely useless ability.

Khajit race was literally designed to make fun of furries with how bad the abilities are, and yall eat that shit up for breakfast 🤣🤣🤣.
Are you kidding? It's gotta be one of the best. Do you know how hard it is to find an item with the waterbreathing enchant on it?  I'd say it's one of the best. Too bad I don't like playing Argonians because I always have a hard time getting the waterbreathing enchant.
I love night eye for kajiit on switch (main platform for it) and it's so useful. I typically don't need mage or candlelight   for awhile
The absolute best is the PC Master race console ability. All hail the ~.

I'll see myself out.
Wood elves.
Imperial
Tbh the breathe underwater ability does come in handy quite a bit in Oblivion and Morrowind, as there are some quests that require it (or you will have a hard time).

I don't know why Skyrim did away with this, but oh well. 🤷‍♀️
I want to say the unarmed damage boost Khajiits have
Well Adrenaline Rush is outclassed by 4 pieces of Vegetable in a broth sooooo... but I think I will go with Imperial since I have never in my life used the Voice of the Emperor and the extra gold is actually so puny that by the end of it when you are already rolling in cash maybe 300 of those coins came from that ability.
Argonians can breathe underwater, have disease resistance, increased unarmed damage, and histskin. honestly pretty stacked

worst is probably imperials
Orcs passive ability is that they don't have to prove themselves with a side quest to enter Orc strongholds, which can otherwise be as simple as mining iron ore for Grogmar gro-Burzag in Shor's Stone.
Dwemers, they are litteraly unplayable
Well, the Orc special power is literally just temporarily lowering the difficulty, so it's the only power everyone has access to.
r/ShitSkyrimSays
Argonians are goated
Are we talking special ability or passive. As far as passives go The imperials passive is probably the worst. Extra gold is meaningless in this game. Also it may be bugged.
Cats. Night vision is actually useless. If it was a constant effect, sure maybe it’s good. But for it to be a 60 seconds activated power is ridiculous. They also have higher unarmed damage which I actually think is cool and I’d love to take advantage of it except the animation is still a punch. You have extra damage cuz of your claws, it should be a swipe. 

On the other hand, orcs power is OP and was the reason why I couldn’t stop making orcs during Covid lol
I highly recommend a mod named That's Racist. It sets out to rectify the imbalance with the Breton's Dragonskin and 25% magic resistance by, for example, have the Altmer's free magic potion ability (let's be honest, that's all it is) also do an extra 25% damage while in use. Other races have other abilities, of course.
Underwater breathing is still nice to have but it was definitely more useful in past games. Histskin is really nice tho.
I never thought being a lizard in a cold northern environment had many benefits
Even though I love nords, their abilities suck. Frost damage is the least concerning out of the three elemental types, and their war cry blows since it's once per day. I forget it even exists.
I hate to say it because I really do love the race, but the khajiit racial ability is the worst because it is the most useless for me. Their racial ability is night eye and it let's you see in the dark. Every other race has an ability that can be used in some kind of building. Orc gets the rage, which gives you a damage bonus] Nords get the sorta shout thing which is useful when you're starting out] Imperials get the voice of the emperor, which will make enemies lower level than you afraid for a bit, wood elf gets the command animals, high elf gets the magicka regen, Breton gets the atronach ability, and the argonian can breathe underwater.
Imperials have the best with the calming voice of the emperor. Works great when you get caught stealing or accidentally attack someone
Imperials. Yes it's useful to find extra gold early on but once you reach level 30 or so, you tend to have too much regardless. The voice of the emperor isn't all that great either, the same results can be achieved with a calm spell. The voice of the emperor can also only be used once a day vs a calm spell being used however often you like. Overall the abilities of imperial are only useful for the first 10 to 20 levels in my opinion.
Most of them are pretty meh, but that was a design choice i guess to allow players to build their dragonborn however they want without worrying about race. 

I'd vote Imperials, though. Gold doesnt matter pretty quickly.
Mod the shit out of the water.

YOU HEAR THAT KYNARETH! TONIGHT! WE MOD! IN WATER!

EULALIAAAAAAAAA! *kersplash*
    ![gif](giphy|8L17KLxT0c1YdwBNlh|downsized)
I've played as a wood elf many times and never needed to use its ability so I'd say that, j think its called command animal.
Imperials. Finding an extra 10 coins isn’t that helpful, it’s easy to get rich later in game anyways.
I don't even know what imperials do, that's how useless they are. But still, the Khajiit night vision could have been handled better. If they just got rid of that stupid blue filter that makes it even harder to see half the time... With mods that get rid of the haze it's actually very useful.
It has to be the kajit(I don't know how to spell it) because it literally just gives you improved vision, and better unarmed attack
Humans suck.
Imperial luck and voice of the emperor. Are both crap. Night eye for the khajiit I also pretty useless, and the base game lacks unarmed perks. but in anniversary edition with survival mode they +15 to warmth and can eat raw meats, which is marginally more useful than imperial luck. Then against, ita 10 less than Nords get, and Nords get frost resistance 50%.
Water breathing is the best it’s a passive ability
High elf, its just an early fire cloak once you get the spell it becomes useless
    You mean dunmer?

High elf is bonus magic
        Oh yeah, you right I always get the three elves mixed up, lol.
Nords.

"Reduced effects from cold."

Does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING against the passive environmental cold in survival mode...

Which is exactly what would have caused it to become a thing to begin with...
Personally, I feel like nords. Their power is to make things run away, which is slightly useful. But their cold tolerance….. only helps with magic. If you’re in survival, it doesn’t help you.
Tour de France
Honestly I've only posted Redguard and Kajit. I've only used the redguard ability twice in the last 12 yrs. The Kahjit night vision it pretty cool.
I thought this was askreddit at first. I was going to say the one for blending in at night, or the one that can’t be blinded by a laser pointer, or the one that is good at hand grinding corn, or the one that will be able to virtue signal for all other races lol.
Argonians also get claws even though it’s not listed, so you start with your unarmed being stronger than iron swords lol
    Wtf I didn't know this. I don't use mods is this in the base game??????
        Yes. Argonian Claws only do 10 damage (basic unarmed strike only does 5 at most, without power attacking, and yes it is in base game. Khajiit's Racial Ability is "Claws" and their Claws do 15 points of damage. Also, when you power-attack with Khajiit claws the damage is multiplied by 2.5 instead of just a x2 multiplier.
            You forgot nightvision for khajits, friend. Me thinks it is very handy sometimes… although me prefers the warmth of a torch in this cold bitten land.
                May you walk on warm sands.
                    Brrrrr, this place is freezing… this one thinks he needs an extra fur, while wearing 4 already… 

(T-shirt, jersey and jacket all at once indoors and still getting chills, for real… and no I’m not khajit IRL)
                        Darnit, I was going to say I have coins for your wares.
                            Khajit has no wares, the nords bought everything… and threatened to turn this one into a rug. This one thought ”No thank you.”
                        The cold never bothered me anyway!
                I wish the night vision was better. For me it almost never actually helps me see anything it just washes out the color.
                    The natural vision of khajit is good, but could be better. This one thinks the warmth of a torch is good when out there, but when sneaking by enemies, the nightvision is very useful, although a bit… dark too. It is what it is, this one wishes he could modify it but natural things are what they are meant to be, yes?
                    It used to be very useful on Morrowind and Oblivion, but Skyrim has all caves anf dungeons with good illumination
                No, I did not forget that. Night Eye is the Racial POWER not ability. Racial Abilities are static (meaning they are always on) while the Racial Power has to be activated, just like Shouts have to be activated.
            I'm pretty sure it's displayed as 15 damage for Khajiits in-game, but you actually do 12 damage. Also basic unarmed is 4 damage.
This is the page on it: https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unarmed_Combat
                No, you actually do 15 points of damage, like the ability says. I am pretty sure the basic punch does five damage, not four.
                    >†The in-game text states that the Claws passive ability adds 15 points to Khajiits' unarmed damage, but the actual effect magnitude is 12. The game data also describes the effect as "Khajiit claws do four times the damage of a man's punch", which is incorrect, as it is actually 5.5 times the damage.
            Oh man got to love a PunchCat playthrough.
            Gotta love a racial that incentivizes avoiding gaining xp from early fights.
        they're spreading minor misinformation but not really. argonians start with beast race claws. which is 10 base unarmed damage instead of 4, but are missing the khajiit skill, which adds another 12
Tbh, just saw “Waterbreathing” and thought they looked sick, so I picked ‘em
    i played d&d before skyrim, and knew nothing of TES when i started. i only picked argonian because i heard something about dragonborns being a thing in the game
        Skyrim was my first RPG ever over here. Before it, I played Halo, Kerbal Space Program, and Pokémon almost exclusively. 

Now I have a crippling addiction to RPGs. Gotta play New Vegas to get the DAMN SPIDERS OFF MAH SKIN
Argonian and Khajiit also get ~~immunity~~ _resistance_ to disease in survival I think? At least being able to eat raw meat and fish.
    Argonians are 50% resistant to diseases. I remember playing a different race one time and I kept getting annoyed bc I would get vampirism almost anytime I was in combat with vampire. I didn't remember getting it as often when I played as an argonian
One time I found a ring or helmet, can’t remember which now, that allowed you to breathe underwater forever. The playthrough was un-modded vanilla on the Switch before AE.
    Yep, you can get an amulet of water breathing and the effect is also on one of the dragon priest masks. I keep it on me at all times
        I found that amulet in Oblivion
    I did find that too you can also disenchant it and geti it to whatever you want
    That must be the helmet from Solsteim. I forgot the name of the set but it's a whole armor set with the special blue armor material.
It's locked unless you're like, level 35 or so, and you have to find the book first.
        Deathbrand Armor (made of Stalhrim). Decent suite of enchantments, but you can also use an enchanting table to put Waterbreathing on any regular helmet or necklace.
            I've still never completed the Dragonborn DLC in all this time, oof
                I've never gone to Solstheim or whatever the island is called
    Don't remember the helmet, I remember the water walking boots on Solsthiem.

Helmet is probably from the same legendary set you can get on Solsthiem.
    Yeah, but you have to go out of your way to make sure you get one early in the game.

Due to a quirk of the shop inventory tables the breath underwater enchantment is available in shops from level 1, but then gets bumped off the table entirely when you reach level 5. It doesn't start to appear on random loot until level 40 or something, and I think it doesn't show back up in shops again until level 45 or so. I haven't looked up the exact numbers in a while. 

Either way, it is possible to have leveled up enough to bump the enchantment off the shop tables before you get to the Riverwood Trader, leading many players to never see it.

  
Which is a shame as it is very useful, and a decently valuable enchantment.  It may not be the best choice, but it is a good choice for leveling up enchantment early in the game.
    its so funny cuz its a passive effect that doesnt have a multiplier so you can disenchant it and put it on anything you want for a petty soul gem
Plus the disease resistance ain't bad. Getting rockjoints early in a dungeon for instance can be tough in the early/mid game.
    if you have a hawk feather you can just eat it and cure all your diseases 👌🏼
        What are the odds you have a hawk feather on demand? If you're not actively spec'ing into alchemy, there aren't many that you come by easily.

There's like a 10% chance you can get them from alchemists but you only get a few at a time, so if you're not going out of your way to hunt them down you probably won't end up with many.
I imagine swimming in survival mode makes you immediately cold as balls
    It does, especially in snowy areas. You can die from the cold while swimming in under 30 seconds unless you cast Flame Cloak or something.
    It does but only in snowy and ice areas 
I believe 90% of the players disable survival though
Using imperious (race overhaul mod) argonians get a quest to search underwater chests to fully unlock racial bonuses and its honestly a blast haha
And on survival mode they can eat raw meat without getting food poisoning. Same with Khajit.
don't argonians also get a 5x multiplier (opposed to regular 2x) on their right hand unarmed power attacks if they're vampires?
And disease resistance
The waterbreathing isn't all that big of a deal tbh. You can achieve the same results with a potion or enchantment. There are other more useful perks for argonians though
I *love* diving underwater in this game. Potion ingredients, shipwrecks, sunken treasure, environmental storytelling, the ability to snipe your enemies from a distance because the AI refuses to swim... It's great
khajits should be able to toggle night vision without a timer fr
I used to take for granted their illness invulnerability, and now every play thru i get pissed off by Ataxia. Argonians aren't half bad imo lol
I love playing argonians - poison resistant, wolverine healing, water breathing ninjas.
Berserker’s Rage needs that once-per day limitation because it’s already OP as it is. I’d say the most powerful/best racial ability there is
    The Argonian’s Histkin, Redguard’s Adrenaline Rush, and the High Elf’s Highborn (and the 50 bonus Magicka) are all really good as well. Especially for those sticky situations you can find yourself in early on.
        Meanwhile, me, a Khajiit:

This one can see in a dark room…
            Okay, I *literally* just found out that Night Eye is a lesser power, so it can be used multiple times a day instead of one, which is how I thought it worked. Now I need to make a Khajiit thief with that in mind
                This one would recommend that Khajiit avoid being a thief, unless Khajiit is smarter than a nord and is not caught. Khajiit will give this one much trouble if Khajiit is caught and idiot nords tighten security.
            I don’t like the green tint of the night vision
                Night vision was much easier to see stuff in Oblivion. I don't like it in Skyrim at all.
                [Subtle Night Eye](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13091) fixes that.
            Punchcats are a blast to play though
        I've never played an orc in my life,  so I'm not biased, but they all pale in comparison. Double damage output and cutting damage taken in half for long enough to stomp on any enemy that doesn't decide to fuck of and fly around for a few minutes, let's you take on foes way before you have any business to under normal circumstances.
        Fun fact, Redguard's adrenaline rush's best use is for sprinting. If you make vegetable soup, you gain the passive effect "restore 1 stamina and health a second for 720 seconds" which lets you spam power attacks infinitely and faster than Adrenaline Rush would
    Orc master race
        BOC-Big Orc Cock
            You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people.
                Khajiit is innocent of this crime!  
(Also, make a punchcat. They're fun!)
                    Reminds me of my kitty nightblade from ESO: Miouch. If I ever play that game properly, at least I don't have to waste a few hours coming up with a name.
                    I really wish they were more viable in the harder difficulties cause they are very fun
            Never should've come here!
            YOU! REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THIS REALM OF REALITY. IMMEDIATELY!
            Oho. You really shouldn’t have done that. Enjoy the view.
            Stop! You have violated the law!
    What's the point if you can just sleep the whole day with the press of a button? It's just annoying. Personally I just never used any of the abilities because of them, so that's a waste of a game mechanic.
    Yea but if you just wait for 24 hours after every big fight you'll always be so OP that nothing can stop you.
        that’s why I play on survival
    Imagine an army of beserking Orcs in heavy armor marching towards you.
Between Oblivion and Skyrim, I've logged so much time playing as an Argonian that I *forgot* that none of the other races can breathe underwater and get annoyed when I try a play through on something else 

*"What do you mean I can't just sit at the bottom of the lake for 20 minutes while I'm looking up quest stuff on my phone?"*
Not true. All Racial Abilities are passive. You are thinking of Racial Powers, however, the Racial Power for Khajiit (Night Eye) is unlimited times each day.
I’ve gone argonian in my first play through when it first released and yet again all these years later.
I'm curious; what do you think about Dragon Aspect? IMO it's the best shout in the game (or at least one of them), but it's limited to once a day due to how powerful it is.
    I never finished the main quest because the whole dragon killer story isn't that appealing to me.  
But Dragon Aspect looks like a great and hillariously overpowered shout indeed.
        Dragon Aspect isn't from the main quest; it's from Dragonborn. Give it a shot if you haven't already.
I agree with the, once-per-day thing. A 10 minute cool down would be enough for most effects to stop over use and even then I probably wouldn't use them.
I'm using a mod to shorten it. Something like two in game hours I think. While it can be argued it's op to do that for example with the orc's ability, if you can just sleep the whole day with the press of a button anyway, then what's the point? 

The whole one per day is just a stupid bad game system. They should have made some system that would be charging based on your activities, that would make it something that you can work with. 

With the vanilla system I simply never used any of the abilities.
    Active abilities should just be a special spells that you know at start (and they should be the only spells you know at start). They should cost magicka and be balanced accordingly.

And yeah, once per day - or even worse, selecting the spells you can use when resting like in D&D - is just not a fun game mechanic.
> The nice thing with waterbreathing is that it's a passive. 

The Argonian waterbreathing is hilarious to me because in its original incarnation in Morrowind, it was a *once per day* power. 

I think it was a power in Oblivion too? I might be wrong on that.
> all once-per-day abilities are sortof meh just because of their limitation of use

Not really. After using it and it burns out, set your wait time to 24 hrs, and you're good to go again. It's not like you have to wait, ya know, the whole 24 hrs while still playing. Maybe a bit of a cheat, but useful.
I've only ever used Daily powers with the Aetherial Crown or the Ring of Hircine.
On the other hand, when you're low level out on the plains West of Whiterun and run across  an unexpected saber cat, Command Animal is pretty damn useful.
    Also commanding mammoths to attack giants is pretty clutch early game.
    While useful, battle cry would also be useful, and wouldn't only work in that one scenario. Command animal is great for using mammoths to fight giants, but the mammoths are more useful to kill than the giants.
        Giant toes are way better than mammoth tusks
            Grand soul from mammoth and greater soul from giant
                Ohhhh so you're an enchanter then
            Someone mentioned it, but its for the grand souls. Its the easiest enemy to find to get grand souls from, especially earlier in the game. Lster one, black souls become much easier to get
        Battle Cry only works on creatures level 6 and lower. Command Animal works on all Animals (Ice Wolf, Pit Wolf, Wolf, Sabre Cat, Snowy Sabre Cat, Cave Bear, Snowy Cave Bear, Frostbite Spider, Giant Frostbite Spider, Mammoths) Trolls are not considered animals, unfortunately.
            No, Battlecry has a Magnitude of 99, so it hits enemies up to Level 99.
    That's your problem. Saber cats/bears while exploring *should* be expected... considering that one of them is definitely around the next bend. Or under that rock. Or behind that tree. Or running at you from behind. About to take off a third of your life.

Always.
        Or on the downside of that little slope just outside Whiterun, so close you could hit the city wall with a mead bottle. Completely hidden despite the fact that little slope is barely higher than a Bosmer. Easy to avoid with experience, but a nasty shock the first time. Sometimes there's a *pair* of them there.
            Saber cats. Bears. Trolls.

They're like visa. Everywhere a low level wants to be.
Dark elves also have fire resist.
    Yeah, that’s their main draw. Slap on that iron helm of the unburned you find in the mage’s college quest and you’re the unburninator
    I am talking about specific abilities. The fire resist is really good and the best thing they have, but their activated ability is just meh
Watched a video recently that said for some reasons vampires are considered animals for some reason. I wonder if the wood elf abilities counts for them too!?
    it's weird - Voice of the Sky will work on some vampires, too so I guess they are animals
        Aaaand that answers why the vampires at Clavicus Vile's shrine were ignoring me just now, since I found the marker I missed on the way down from dropping off the Horn. Wild that I just stumbled across the answer.
    If they're animals why does my murder count go up when I kill them for the Dawnguard?
        Vampires are NPCs rather than creatures, I'm wondering if Voice of the Sky works because VampireFaction is considered "friendly" to wolves, skeevers and spiders? It'd be interesting to see if Kyne's Peace works too
I nearly always play as a bosmer and just used command animal at the beginning of my current playthrough for the first time ever. I was dropped in a random location with the alternate perspectives mod and that random location was like 5 feet away from a bear. So. Thanks AP!
    One of the best use cases for it is against spriggans since it over rides their command animal and turns a hard fight into a woodland massacre
For the most part, racial powers aren't really for "most fights in the game", they for the beginning of the game. Early on, being able to avoid fights with bears and sabre cats is very useful.
    Eh, not really. Battle cry and voice if the emperor are really good even late into the game to give you a break, and the orc's barbarian rage gets better as your level gets higher. Dragonskin is an at will 50% magic absorb, which is always going to be helpful. Highborn and histskin are super useful in a dangerous fight, and adrenaline rush is always nice to have. Night eye does help, ancestors wraith is just flame cloak, and command animal falls off in usefulness. Its too niche of an ability compared to all the other ones
Animal allegiance/command animal was literally completely useless for me :D imagine my excitement at figuring out you can have an animal buddy (temporarily)!!

I load up the game as a wood elf only to find out command animal literally doesn’t work in my game except for as a dragon shout… a feature, not a bug!
Dark elves have 50% fire resistance, I have an amulet that gives me 50% fire resistance. Fighting dragons is an absolute breeze because of this. My character will make the sounds as if she were being damaged, but I'll sustain no actual damage at all. It's very handy.
    You still take damage. Element and magic resistance caps at 85%, so your only taking 15% of the damage. I am also not talking about dark elves as a whole, i am talking about ancestors wraith specifically. Dark elves fire resistance is what makes them a good race
Ah yes, the Frog strategy
You can run to the river as any race and cross to the other side.
    I found they would often follow me :') Sometimes swimming downriver was a nice fast escape though.
Even for that, just use mage light


Imperial luck is actually bugged, and EVERY race has it, which is hilarious
    Makes sense, every race is part of the Empire
        It’d be funny if you lost it if you joined the stormcloaks
            “We’re all out luck, lads.”
        Hell yeah! Suck it Stormcloaks, LONG LIVE THE EMPIRE!!!
            Sad Ulfric noises
                _FUS RO DAH_
            *Proceeds to assassinate the Emperor*

Problem?
        **Altmer screeching sound intensifies**
    Every race starts with imperial luck? 🤔
        Technically yes, the ability is supposed to be disabled once you leave Helgen and are not an Imperial, but due to the script function not being implemented correctly, the ability remains active.
            For the last 13 years? I know some bugs are left in intentionally but this feels like a very fixable issue.
                Yes. Bethesda aren't interested in bug fixing, they have modders to do that for free! Then they get annoyed that people aren't paying them for these mods they didn't develop, so they release an update to break them all. This happens every few months to some degree.
    Well, the Imperials think we all fall under their laws so it's fitting in a way,
Imperial luck is actually buggy and every race gets it. So all imperials got is voice of the emperor 
    Are you serious about Imperial Luck?
        Surprise!
            I have played Skyrim for 4 years and never knew the truth about Imperial Luck…

How many other lies have I been told by the council?
Imperial luck more like imperial suck
I cannot play without night eye and my brightness is maxed. Also night eye is a racial power that can be used constantly, so to me it is the absolute best racial power in the game. This post is about racial abilities though. In that case Khajiit suck because I don’t use hand to hand.
Night Eye is the Racial Power, NOT Racial Ability.
hard agree on the night eye perk
>Khajiit’s “Night-Eye”

Cast magelight and face everyone head on with sword and board like a true Nord.
Loved night eye for my stealth character
Their Claws ability is useful in an emergency if you get disarmed. The Night Eye, not so much.
    Aye, claws are good. Shame there wasn't an extended skill tree for melee or at least more perks. Love the idea of a khajiit monk, spin kicking a bandit in full heavy armor off of a bridge while wearing priest robes. 

Make him look like Tai Lung.
        I've always wanted to play an unarmed Khajiit and name him Mr Meowgi
            Then you know what must be done, better start creating him.
            I played an unarmed Khajiit build and named him Puunclaw. Easy early game, tough midgame, one to two hit elder dragons by endgame.
        Best one I've heard was someone who made an argonian Throws-his-fists or something like that as a pugilist build. Might do that for my next playthrough with ordinator
        Never knew that I wanted this
            Thankfully there are mods but you know, would've been cool in the vanilla game.
                You can do it in vanilla and actually its pretty op early its like having a daedric starting weapon.
                    I think it's more than a dragon bone sword at base. But then you get Fists of Steel and those gloves from the Ratway...
                        And then the game outscales you..
        No they ain't 🤣🤣🤣🤣, 15 damage is a fucking joke and the attack speed and range is horrid, just pick up your weapon.

If you're in the early game you're trying to level up so you wanna pick em up right away, and if it's anything other than early game the damage is real bad, not useful in any situation even in the rare instances you are disarmed and can't use bound sword.
    I like using Khajiit for stealth archery because of their skill bonuses and their claws making for a good melee fallback option that doesn’t raise other combat skills. Very powerful in the early game when you don’t have many arrows too.
    No it isn't 🤣🤣🤣🤣, 22 damage is a fucking joke and the attack speed and range is horrid, just pick up your weapon.

If you're in the early game you're trying to level up so you wanna pick em up right away, and if it's anything other than early game the damage is real bad, not useful in any situation even in the rare instances you are disarmed and can't use bound sword.
        Claws adds an additional 12 (not 15) points of unarmed damage to the existing base damage of 10 unarmed. That total damage of 22 per strike is the same as the base damage of an Ebony greatsword, which is certainly not a joke weapon in an emergency.
            So I corrected that in a proper statement later but even still

Claws do 22 damage unarmed. This might seem really good early game as that's actually more than a lot of One Handed weapons, the problem with it is the attack speed and range is absolutely abysmal, you have to literally hug enemies for very slow and very short ranged attacks, even an iron sword ends up working out better since your range is longer and your attack speed in faster, so you actually end up doing more damage and more importantly on higher difficulties end up taking much less damage, which in turn let's you deal more damage. And this is just early game, obviously once you get 1-2 perks into one/two handed it's just irrelevant, and most importantly you NEVER want to use unarmed early game in anything other than brawls since you wanna level up One Handed or Two Handed or whatever and unarmed doesn't help with that. Maybe if you want to use an unarmed gimmick it might be useful, but that's purely a fun novice difficulty thing.

Khajit Claws are useless outside of brawls, which are never a real factor.
                If you are disarmed every fight is a brawl. Look back at my first post to see the context as to when Claws is useful.
                    No, and it takes less than 15 seconds to pick up where you shouldn't be taking any damage and do vastly higher damage when you do, not to mention bound weaponry being a much better option in a pinch, also, the amount of Draugr that use Disarm is not rare at most, a bad solution for a very rare issue.
                        Look back at my first post to see the context as to when Claws is useful.
It's worse in Oblivion. Turned everything bright blue
Who... uses an enchantment slot for waterbreathing?

Even if you want to swim longer you might as well just pick more HP to suffocate longer?

Voice of the emperor is "calm" instead of the nord "fear". So you can pickpocket people and then scream at them when they start complaining :D
    Stealth Archers, limited number of effective head enchantments.
        Fortify archery is a head enchantment is it not?
            Yes, who in the world is shooting themselves in the foot by having only one enchantment on their gear though? Dual Enchantment perk: Archery/Waterbreathing.
        Keep a spare ring or necklace in the backpack. The overlap of situations where you need waterbreathing AND normal enchants at the same time is zero.
Also worth noting that the shout Animal Allegiance does the same thing that the bosmer power does, so any race can do it
    And less often than the shout. Now if it was a permanent pet that would be awesome. But unfortunately you'll need a mod for that.
Voice of the Emperor is the most powerful AoE calm in the game, and you can use it from the start.  It is more powerful than the level 100 Illusion Harmony spell.

There are not that many situations where you really NEED an AoE calm spell that affects everything up to level 99, but when you do, it is awesome.

Imperial Luck is of course useless, since every race gets it anyway due to a bug.  And even if it were limited to Imperials, it would still suck because a few extra gold coins just does not make that much difference long term.

I do like playing Imperials for RP purposes, though, and they make for decent paladins or spell knights with their starting skill bonuses, at least in the early game.
    This is true. I had a situation where Serana bugged out and kept killing Parthurnaxx. Beating her up didn’t work. Calm didn’t work. Voice of the Emperor? Worked like a charm. Definitely very useful situationally
        There ONLY time I used Voice of the Emperor when I was an Imperial was to stop my followers fighting each other lol
Voice if the Emporer has gotten me out of some sticky situations.
    I wonder what the Dragonborn actually says when Voice of the Emperor is used.
        "Are we about to kiss right now?" Instantly the enemy is too uncomfortable to keep fighting.
            I do like the idea of a Dragonborn who is just so socially inept he can resolve differences for a short time.
        "Daddy chill"
        Can't we just settle this over a pint?
    Same here, especially against long-range magic users, it allows me to get into melee range without taking damage
If you play a sneak/dagger build it's a fantastic ability, walk up to any enemy, calm them, then walk behind them and cut their throat. Most things using that build go down in one hit but if you happen to run across something that doesn't you can get one hit, use voice of the emperor and then finish them off with another sneak attack.
Highborn is good
    Highborn saved me from tough spots as a conjuration-destruction mage
    I use highborn to quickly level my restoration, destruction, and conjuration by summoning a mistman, then casting turn undead on it (or wrath man and chain lightning bolt)
    I love Highborn. High Elf is my go-to race for mage builds.
    The definition of a good racial ability is that it is not quickly outmoded by enchantments between level 20 and 30.

You don't need to regen your magicka if you have 100% cost reduction, which you should.

Highborn is outmoded by enchantments. Therefore Highborn does not fit this definition.

Therefore, Highborn is not good.
        Whose definition?
            Some assholes. 
            This other guy's mom's.
        More of a matter of opinion, and not to mention play style.
        Bretons passive 25% magic resist is up there then. You cannot simply replace it with enchants at lvl 30. Sure you could slot it on your gear but without being breton, youll always be using those enchants on it where a breton can use it on something else.
            You can absolutely replace Breton's magic resistance with enchantments as well as boons and the Lord or Atronach stone.
                I strongly disagree and i use the lords stone. I get nax magic,resist with 2/3 alteration perk and mara's blessing
        >The definition of a good racial ability is that it is not quickly outmoded by enchantments between level 20 and 30.

That is a *weird* definition.  You know what else isn't quickly outmoded by enchantments?  Night Eye
            Eh, I've got magic or brightness settings for that.
                Exactly this. Night Eye is just a technical issue.
            Hardly a weird definition. What's the point of having an ability that loses its usefulness?
        Unless you are exploiting, you can't 100% every school. Even if you just 100% your two favorite schools, Highborn never stops having a use for a pure mage character. It can essentially act as a free fast mana refill during a fight (unless you are habitually running out of mana still every fight, then a once a day quick fill isn't helpful.

Will concede that it doesn't see much at for me anymore as a pure mage at level 80, but it was worth it at low levels fighting hard enemies and it's general use makes it applicable to many situations
        I think racial abilities in general are to give you an edge early on. I will agree though that berserk rage is the best racial ability, hands down.
        >You don't need to regen your magicka if you have 100% cost reduction, which you should.

oh, my bad, didn't know a singleplayer game had rules i had to follow
            Non-sequitur is your racial ability!
Jumping into the nearest body of water is also my go-to and I love playing argonian for that reason 😂
Also great for the Goldenglow job if you fuck up
Fucking lol
Quite understandable.
Doesn't the Dunmer fire resistence perfect counter the fire weakness from being a vampire?
    Useful as that may seem, you can just keep a fire res potion in your bags in case you face a fire mage or dragon. Basing your entire race choice just on that is... *highly unreasonable.*

You mean dunmer?

High elf is bonus magic
    Oh yeah, you right I always get the three elves mixed up, lol.
Wtf I didn't know this. I don't use mods is this in the base game??????
    Yes. Argonian Claws only do 10 damage (basic unarmed strike only does 5 at most, without power attacking, and yes it is in base game. Khajiit's Racial Ability is "Claws" and their Claws do 15 points of damage. Also, when you power-attack with Khajiit claws the damage is multiplied by 2.5 instead of just a x2 multiplier.
        You forgot nightvision for khajits, friend. Me thinks it is very handy sometimes… although me prefers the warmth of a torch in this cold bitten land.
            May you walk on warm sands.
                Brrrrr, this place is freezing… this one thinks he needs an extra fur, while wearing 4 already… 

(T-shirt, jersey and jacket all at once indoors and still getting chills, for real… and no I’m not khajit IRL)
                    Darnit, I was going to say I have coins for your wares.
                        Khajit has no wares, the nords bought everything… and threatened to turn this one into a rug. This one thought ”No thank you.”
                    The cold never bothered me anyway!
            I wish the night vision was better. For me it almost never actually helps me see anything it just washes out the color.
                The natural vision of khajit is good, but could be better. This one thinks the warmth of a torch is good when out there, but when sneaking by enemies, the nightvision is very useful, although a bit… dark too. It is what it is, this one wishes he could modify it but natural things are what they are meant to be, yes?
                It used to be very useful on Morrowind and Oblivion, but Skyrim has all caves anf dungeons with good illumination
            No, I did not forget that. Night Eye is the Racial POWER not ability. Racial Abilities are static (meaning they are always on) while the Racial Power has to be activated, just like Shouts have to be activated.
        I'm pretty sure it's displayed as 15 damage for Khajiits in-game, but you actually do 12 damage. Also basic unarmed is 4 damage.
This is the page on it: https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unarmed_Combat
            No, you actually do 15 points of damage, like the ability says. I am pretty sure the basic punch does five damage, not four.
                >†The in-game text states that the Claws passive ability adds 15 points to Khajiits' unarmed damage, but the actual effect magnitude is 12. The game data also describes the effect as "Khajiit claws do four times the damage of a man's punch", which is incorrect, as it is actually 5.5 times the damage.
        Oh man got to love a PunchCat playthrough.
        Gotta love a racial that incentivizes avoiding gaining xp from early fights.
    they're spreading minor misinformation but not really. argonians start with beast race claws. which is 10 base unarmed damage instead of 4, but are missing the khajiit skill, which adds another 12
i played d&d before skyrim, and knew nothing of TES when i started. i only picked argonian because i heard something about dragonborns being a thing in the game
    Skyrim was my first RPG ever over here. Before it, I played Halo, Kerbal Space Program, and Pokémon almost exclusively. 

Now I have a crippling addiction to RPGs. Gotta play New Vegas to get the DAMN SPIDERS OFF MAH SKIN
Argonians are 50% resistant to diseases. I remember playing a different race one time and I kept getting annoyed bc I would get vampirism almost anytime I was in combat with vampire. I didn't remember getting it as often when I played as an argonian
Yep, you can get an amulet of water breathing and the effect is also on one of the dragon priest masks. I keep it on me at all times
    I found that amulet in Oblivion
I did find that too you can also disenchant it and geti it to whatever you want
That must be the helmet from Solsteim. I forgot the name of the set but it's a whole armor set with the special blue armor material.
It's locked unless you're like, level 35 or so, and you have to find the book first.
    Deathbrand Armor (made of Stalhrim). Decent suite of enchantments, but you can also use an enchanting table to put Waterbreathing on any regular helmet or necklace.
        I've still never completed the Dragonborn DLC in all this time, oof
            I've never gone to Solstheim or whatever the island is called
Don't remember the helmet, I remember the water walking boots on Solsthiem.

Helmet is probably from the same legendary set you can get on Solsthiem.
Yeah, but you have to go out of your way to make sure you get one early in the game.

Due to a quirk of the shop inventory tables the breath underwater enchantment is available in shops from level 1, but then gets bumped off the table entirely when you reach level 5. It doesn't start to appear on random loot until level 40 or something, and I think it doesn't show back up in shops again until level 45 or so. I haven't looked up the exact numbers in a while. 

Either way, it is possible to have leveled up enough to bump the enchantment off the shop tables before you get to the Riverwood Trader, leading many players to never see it.

  
Which is a shame as it is very useful, and a decently valuable enchantment.  It may not be the best choice, but it is a good choice for leveling up enchantment early in the game.
its so funny cuz its a passive effect that doesnt have a multiplier so you can disenchant it and put it on anything you want for a petty soul gem
if you have a hawk feather you can just eat it and cure all your diseases 👌🏼
    What are the odds you have a hawk feather on demand? If you're not actively spec'ing into alchemy, there aren't many that you come by easily.

There's like a 10% chance you can get them from alchemists but you only get a few at a time, so if you're not going out of your way to hunt them down you probably won't end up with many.
It does, especially in snowy areas. You can die from the cold while swimming in under 30 seconds unless you cast Flame Cloak or something.
It does but only in snowy and ice areas 
I believe 90% of the players disable survival though
The Argonian’s Histkin, Redguard’s Adrenaline Rush, and the High Elf’s Highborn (and the 50 bonus Magicka) are all really good as well. Especially for those sticky situations you can find yourself in early on.
    Meanwhile, me, a Khajiit:

This one can see in a dark room…
        Okay, I *literally* just found out that Night Eye is a lesser power, so it can be used multiple times a day instead of one, which is how I thought it worked. Now I need to make a Khajiit thief with that in mind
            This one would recommend that Khajiit avoid being a thief, unless Khajiit is smarter than a nord and is not caught. Khajiit will give this one much trouble if Khajiit is caught and idiot nords tighten security.
        I don’t like the green tint of the night vision
            Night vision was much easier to see stuff in Oblivion. I don't like it in Skyrim at all.
            [Subtle Night Eye](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13091) fixes that.
        Punchcats are a blast to play though
    I've never played an orc in my life,  so I'm not biased, but they all pale in comparison. Double damage output and cutting damage taken in half for long enough to stomp on any enemy that doesn't decide to fuck of and fly around for a few minutes, let's you take on foes way before you have any business to under normal circumstances.
    Fun fact, Redguard's adrenaline rush's best use is for sprinting. If you make vegetable soup, you gain the passive effect "restore 1 stamina and health a second for 720 seconds" which lets you spam power attacks infinitely and faster than Adrenaline Rush would
Orc master race
    BOC-Big Orc Cock
        You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people.
            Khajiit is innocent of this crime!  
(Also, make a punchcat. They're fun!)
                Reminds me of my kitty nightblade from ESO: Miouch. If I ever play that game properly, at least I don't have to waste a few hours coming up with a name.
                I really wish they were more viable in the harder difficulties cause they are very fun
        Never should've come here!
        YOU! REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THIS REALM OF REALITY. IMMEDIATELY!
        Oho. You really shouldn’t have done that. Enjoy the view.
        Stop! You have violated the law!
What's the point if you can just sleep the whole day with the press of a button? It's just annoying. Personally I just never used any of the abilities because of them, so that's a waste of a game mechanic.
Yea but if you just wait for 24 hours after every big fight you'll always be so OP that nothing can stop you.
    that’s why I play on survival
Imagine an army of beserking Orcs in heavy armor marching towards you.
I never finished the main quest because the whole dragon killer story isn't that appealing to me.  
But Dragon Aspect looks like a great and hillariously overpowered shout indeed.
    Dragon Aspect isn't from the main quest; it's from Dragonborn. Give it a shot if you haven't already.
Active abilities should just be a special spells that you know at start (and they should be the only spells you know at start). They should cost magicka and be balanced accordingly.

And yeah, once per day - or even worse, selecting the spells you can use when resting like in D&D - is just not a fun game mechanic.
Also commanding mammoths to attack giants is pretty clutch early game.
While useful, battle cry would also be useful, and wouldn't only work in that one scenario. Command animal is great for using mammoths to fight giants, but the mammoths are more useful to kill than the giants.
    Giant toes are way better than mammoth tusks
        Grand soul from mammoth and greater soul from giant
            Ohhhh so you're an enchanter then
        Someone mentioned it, but its for the grand souls. Its the easiest enemy to find to get grand souls from, especially earlier in the game. Lster one, black souls become much easier to get
    Battle Cry only works on creatures level 6 and lower. Command Animal works on all Animals (Ice Wolf, Pit Wolf, Wolf, Sabre Cat, Snowy Sabre Cat, Cave Bear, Snowy Cave Bear, Frostbite Spider, Giant Frostbite Spider, Mammoths) Trolls are not considered animals, unfortunately.
        No, Battlecry has a Magnitude of 99, so it hits enemies up to Level 99.
That's your problem. Saber cats/bears while exploring *should* be expected... considering that one of them is definitely around the next bend. Or under that rock. Or behind that tree. Or running at you from behind. About to take off a third of your life.

Always.
    Or on the downside of that little slope just outside Whiterun, so close you could hit the city wall with a mead bottle. Completely hidden despite the fact that little slope is barely higher than a Bosmer. Easy to avoid with experience, but a nasty shock the first time. Sometimes there's a *pair* of them there.
        Saber cats. Bears. Trolls.

They're like visa. Everywhere a low level wants to be.
Yeah, that’s their main draw. Slap on that iron helm of the unburned you find in the mage’s college quest and you’re the unburninator
I am talking about specific abilities. The fire resist is really good and the best thing they have, but their activated ability is just meh
it's weird - Voice of the Sky will work on some vampires, too so I guess they are animals
    Aaaand that answers why the vampires at Clavicus Vile's shrine were ignoring me just now, since I found the marker I missed on the way down from dropping off the Horn. Wild that I just stumbled across the answer.
If they're animals why does my murder count go up when I kill them for the Dawnguard?
    Vampires are NPCs rather than creatures, I'm wondering if Voice of the Sky works because VampireFaction is considered "friendly" to wolves, skeevers and spiders? It'd be interesting to see if Kyne's Peace works too
One of the best use cases for it is against spriggans since it over rides their command animal and turns a hard fight into a woodland massacre
Eh, not really. Battle cry and voice if the emperor are really good even late into the game to give you a break, and the orc's barbarian rage gets better as your level gets higher. Dragonskin is an at will 50% magic absorb, which is always going to be helpful. Highborn and histskin are super useful in a dangerous fight, and adrenaline rush is always nice to have. Night eye does help, ancestors wraith is just flame cloak, and command animal falls off in usefulness. Its too niche of an ability compared to all the other ones
You still take damage. Element and magic resistance caps at 85%, so your only taking 15% of the damage. I am also not talking about dark elves as a whole, i am talking about ancestors wraith specifically. Dark elves fire resistance is what makes them a good race
I found they would often follow me :') Sometimes swimming downriver was a nice fast escape though.
Makes sense, every race is part of the Empire
    It’d be funny if you lost it if you joined the stormcloaks
        “We’re all out luck, lads.”
    Hell yeah! Suck it Stormcloaks, LONG LIVE THE EMPIRE!!!
        Sad Ulfric noises
            _FUS RO DAH_
        *Proceeds to assassinate the Emperor*

Problem?
    **Altmer screeching sound intensifies**
Every race starts with imperial luck? 🤔
    Technically yes, the ability is supposed to be disabled once you leave Helgen and are not an Imperial, but due to the script function not being implemented correctly, the ability remains active.
        For the last 13 years? I know some bugs are left in intentionally but this feels like a very fixable issue.
            Yes. Bethesda aren't interested in bug fixing, they have modders to do that for free! Then they get annoyed that people aren't paying them for these mods they didn't develop, so they release an update to break them all. This happens every few months to some degree.
Well, the Imperials think we all fall under their laws so it's fitting in a way,
Are you serious about Imperial Luck?
    Surprise!
        I have played Skyrim for 4 years and never knew the truth about Imperial Luck…

How many other lies have I been told by the council?
Aye, claws are good. Shame there wasn't an extended skill tree for melee or at least more perks. Love the idea of a khajiit monk, spin kicking a bandit in full heavy armor off of a bridge while wearing priest robes. 

Make him look like Tai Lung.
    I've always wanted to play an unarmed Khajiit and name him Mr Meowgi
        Then you know what must be done, better start creating him.
        I played an unarmed Khajiit build and named him Puunclaw. Easy early game, tough midgame, one to two hit elder dragons by endgame.
    Best one I've heard was someone who made an argonian Throws-his-fists or something like that as a pugilist build. Might do that for my next playthrough with ordinator
    Never knew that I wanted this
        Thankfully there are mods but you know, would've been cool in the vanilla game.
            You can do it in vanilla and actually its pretty op early its like having a daedric starting weapon.
                I think it's more than a dragon bone sword at base. But then you get Fists of Steel and those gloves from the Ratway...
                    And then the game outscales you..
    No they ain't 🤣🤣🤣🤣, 15 damage is a fucking joke and the attack speed and range is horrid, just pick up your weapon.

If you're in the early game you're trying to level up so you wanna pick em up right away, and if it's anything other than early game the damage is real bad, not useful in any situation even in the rare instances you are disarmed and can't use bound sword.
I like using Khajiit for stealth archery because of their skill bonuses and their claws making for a good melee fallback option that doesn’t raise other combat skills. Very powerful in the early game when you don’t have many arrows too.
No it isn't 🤣🤣🤣🤣, 22 damage is a fucking joke and the attack speed and range is horrid, just pick up your weapon.

If you're in the early game you're trying to level up so you wanna pick em up right away, and if it's anything other than early game the damage is real bad, not useful in any situation even in the rare instances you are disarmed and can't use bound sword.
    Claws adds an additional 12 (not 15) points of unarmed damage to the existing base damage of 10 unarmed. That total damage of 22 per strike is the same as the base damage of an Ebony greatsword, which is certainly not a joke weapon in an emergency.
        So I corrected that in a proper statement later but even still

Claws do 22 damage unarmed. This might seem really good early game as that's actually more than a lot of One Handed weapons, the problem with it is the attack speed and range is absolutely abysmal, you have to literally hug enemies for very slow and very short ranged attacks, even an iron sword ends up working out better since your range is longer and your attack speed in faster, so you actually end up doing more damage and more importantly on higher difficulties end up taking much less damage, which in turn let's you deal more damage. And this is just early game, obviously once you get 1-2 perks into one/two handed it's just irrelevant, and most importantly you NEVER want to use unarmed early game in anything other than brawls since you wanna level up One Handed or Two Handed or whatever and unarmed doesn't help with that. Maybe if you want to use an unarmed gimmick it might be useful, but that's purely a fun novice difficulty thing.

Khajit Claws are useless outside of brawls, which are never a real factor.
            If you are disarmed every fight is a brawl. Look back at my first post to see the context as to when Claws is useful.
                No, and it takes less than 15 seconds to pick up where you shouldn't be taking any damage and do vastly higher damage when you do, not to mention bound weaponry being a much better option in a pinch, also, the amount of Draugr that use Disarm is not rare at most, a bad solution for a very rare issue.
                    Look back at my first post to see the context as to when Claws is useful.
Stealth Archers, limited number of effective head enchantments.
    Fortify archery is a head enchantment is it not?
        Yes, who in the world is shooting themselves in the foot by having only one enchantment on their gear though? Dual Enchantment perk: Archery/Waterbreathing.
    Keep a spare ring or necklace in the backpack. The overlap of situations where you need waterbreathing AND normal enchants at the same time is zero.
And less often than the shout. Now if it was a permanent pet that would be awesome. But unfortunately you'll need a mod for that.
This is true. I had a situation where Serana bugged out and kept killing Parthurnaxx. Beating her up didn’t work. Calm didn’t work. Voice of the Emperor? Worked like a charm. Definitely very useful situationally
    There ONLY time I used Voice of the Emperor when I was an Imperial was to stop my followers fighting each other lol
I wonder what the Dragonborn actually says when Voice of the Emperor is used.
    "Are we about to kiss right now?" Instantly the enemy is too uncomfortable to keep fighting.
        I do like the idea of a Dragonborn who is just so socially inept he can resolve differences for a short time.
    "Daddy chill"
    Can't we just settle this over a pint?
Same here, especially against long-range magic users, it allows me to get into melee range without taking damage
Highborn saved me from tough spots as a conjuration-destruction mage
I use highborn to quickly level my restoration, destruction, and conjuration by summoning a mistman, then casting turn undead on it (or wrath man and chain lightning bolt)
I love Highborn. High Elf is my go-to race for mage builds.
The definition of a good racial ability is that it is not quickly outmoded by enchantments between level 20 and 30.

You don't need to regen your magicka if you have 100% cost reduction, which you should.

Highborn is outmoded by enchantments. Therefore Highborn does not fit this definition.

Therefore, Highborn is not good.
    Whose definition?
        Some assholes. 
        This other guy's mom's.
    More of a matter of opinion, and not to mention play style.
    Bretons passive 25% magic resist is up there then. You cannot simply replace it with enchants at lvl 30. Sure you could slot it on your gear but without being breton, youll always be using those enchants on it where a breton can use it on something else.
        You can absolutely replace Breton's magic resistance with enchantments as well as boons and the Lord or Atronach stone.
            I strongly disagree and i use the lords stone. I get nax magic,resist with 2/3 alteration perk and mara's blessing
    >The definition of a good racial ability is that it is not quickly outmoded by enchantments between level 20 and 30.

That is a *weird* definition.  You know what else isn't quickly outmoded by enchantments?  Night Eye
        Eh, I've got magic or brightness settings for that.
            Exactly this. Night Eye is just a technical issue.
        Hardly a weird definition. What's the point of having an ability that loses its usefulness?
    Unless you are exploiting, you can't 100% every school. Even if you just 100% your two favorite schools, Highborn never stops having a use for a pure mage character. It can essentially act as a free fast mana refill during a fight (unless you are habitually running out of mana still every fight, then a once a day quick fill isn't helpful.

Will concede that it doesn't see much at for me anymore as a pure mage at level 80, but it was worth it at low levels fighting hard enemies and it's general use makes it applicable to many situations
    I think racial abilities in general are to give you an edge early on. I will agree though that berserk rage is the best racial ability, hands down.
    >You don't need to regen your magicka if you have 100% cost reduction, which you should.

oh, my bad, didn't know a singleplayer game had rules i had to follow
        Non-sequitur is your racial ability!
Useful as that may seem, you can just keep a fire res potion in your bags in case you face a fire mage or dragon. Basing your entire race choice just on that is... *highly unreasonable.*
Oh yeah, you right I always get the three elves mixed up, lol.
Yes. Argonian Claws only do 10 damage (basic unarmed strike only does 5 at most, without power attacking, and yes it is in base game.

    Someone mentioned it, but its for the grand souls. Its the easiest enemy to find to get grand souls from, especially earlier in the game. Lster one, black souls become much easier to get
Battle Cry only works on creatures level 6 and lower. Command Animal works on all Animals (Ice Wolf, Pit Wolf, Wolf, Sabre Cat, Snowy Sabre Cat, Cave Bear, Snowy Cave Bear, Frostbite Spider, Giant Frostbite Spider, Mammoths) Trolls are not considered animals, unfortunately.
    No, Battlecry has a Magnitude of 99, so it hits enemies up to Level 99.
Or on the downside of that little slope just outside Whiterun, so close you could hit the city wall with a mead bottle. Completely hidden despite the fact that little slope is barely higher than a Bosmer. Easy to avoid with experience, but a nasty shock the first time. Sometimes there's a *pair* of them there.
    Saber cats. Bears. Trolls.

They're like visa. Everywhere a low level wants to be.
Aaaand that answers why the vampires at Clavicus Vile's shrine were ignoring me just now, since I found the marker I missed on the way down from dropping off the Horn. Wild that I just stumbled across the answer.
Vampires are NPCs rather than creatures, I'm wondering if Voice of the Sky works because VampireFaction is considered "friendly" to wolves, skeevers and spiders? It'd be interesting to see if Kyne's Peace works too
It’d be funny if you lost it if you joined the stormcloaks

Hell yeah! Suck it Stormcloaks, LONG LIVE THE EMPIRE!!!

Problem?
**Altmer screeching sound intensifies**
Technically yes, the ability is supposed to be disabled once you leave Helgen and are not an Imperial, but due to the script function not being implemented correctly, the ability remains active.
    For the last 13 years? I know some bugs are left in intentionally but this feels like a very fixable issue.
        Yes. Bethesda aren't interested in bug fixing, they have modders to do that for free! Then they get annoyed that people aren't paying them for these mods they didn't develop, so they release an update to break them all. This happens every few months to some degree.
Surprise!
    I have played Skyrim for 4 years and never knew the truth about Imperial Luck…

How many other lies have I been told by the council?
I've always wanted to play an unarmed Khajiit and name him Mr Meowgi
    Then you know what must be done, better start creating him.
    I played an unarmed Khajiit build and named him Puunclaw. Easy early game, tough midgame, one to two hit elder dragons by endgame.
Best one I've heard was someone who made an argonian Throws-his-fists or something like that as a pugilist build. Might do that for my next playthrough with ordinator
Never knew that I wanted this
    Thankfully there are mods but you know, would've been cool in the vanilla game.
        You can do it in vanilla and actually its pretty op early its like having a daedric starting weapon.
            I think it's more than a dragon bone sword at base. But then you get Fists of Steel and those gloves from the Ratway...
                And then the game outscales you..
No they ain't 🤣🤣🤣🤣, 15 damage is a fucking joke and the attack speed and range is horrid, just pick up your weapon.

If you're in the early game you're trying to level up so you wanna pick em up right away, and if it's anything other than early game the damage is real bad, not useful in any situation even in the rare instances you are disarmed and can't use bound sword.
Claws adds an additional 12 (not 15) points of unarmed damage to the existing base damage of 10 unarmed. That total damage of 22 per strike is the same as the base damage of an Ebony greatsword, which is certainly not a joke weapon in an emergency.
    So I corrected that in a proper statement later but even still

Claws do 22 damage unarmed. This might seem really good early game as that's actually more than a lot of One Handed weapons, the problem with it is the attack speed and range is absolutely abysmal, you have to literally hug enemies for very slow and very short ranged attacks, even an iron sword ends up working out better since your range is longer and your attack speed in faster, so you actually end up doing more damage and more importantly on higher difficulties end up taking much less damage, which in turn let's you deal more damage. And this is just early game, obviously once you get 1-2 perks into one/two handed it's just irrelevant, and most importantly you NEVER want to use unarmed early game in anything other than brawls since you wanna level up One Handed or Two Handed or whatever and unarmed doesn't help with that. Maybe if you want to use an unarmed gimmick it might be useful, but that's purely a fun novice difficulty thing.

Khajit Claws are useless outside of brawls, which are never a real factor.
        If you are disarmed every fight is a brawl. Look back at my first post to see the context as to when Claws is useful.
            No, and it takes less than 15 seconds to pick up where you shouldn't be taking any damage and do vastly higher damage when you do, not to mention bound weaponry being a much better option in a pinch, also, the amount of Draugr that use Disarm is not rare at most, a bad solution for a very rare issue.
                Look back at my first post to see the context as to when Claws is useful.
Fortify archery is a head enchantment is it not?
    Yes, who in the world is shooting themselves in the foot by having only one enchantment on their gear though? Dual Enchantment perk: Archery/Waterbreathing.
Keep a spare ring or necklace in the backpack. The overlap of situations where you need waterbreathing AND normal enchants at the same time is zero.
There ONLY time I used Voice of the Emperor when I was an Imperial was to stop my followers fighting each other lol
"Are we about to kiss right now?" Instantly the enemy is too uncomfortable to keep fighting.
    I do like the idea of a Dragonborn who is just so socially inept he can resolve differences for a short time.
"Daddy chill"
Can't we just settle this over a pint?
Whose definition?
    Some assholes. 
    This other guy's mom's.
More of a matter of opinion, and not to mention play style.
Bretons passive 25% magic resist is up there then. You cannot simply replace it with enchants at lvl 30. Sure you could slot it on your gear but without being breton, youll always be using those enchants on it where a breton can use it on something else.
    You can absolutely replace Breton's magic resistance with enchantments as well as boons and the Lord or Atronach stone.
        I strongly disagree and i use the lords stone. I get nax magic,resist with 2/3 alteration perk and mara's blessing
>The definition of a good racial ability is that it is not quickly outmoded by enchantments between level 20 and 30.

That is a *weird* definition.  You know what else isn't quickly outmoded by enchantments?  Night Eye
    Eh, I've got magic or brightness settings for that.
        Exactly this. Night Eye is just a technical issue.
    Hardly a weird definition. What's the point of having an ability that loses its usefulness?
Unless you are exploiting, you can't 100% every school. Even if you just 100% your two favorite schools, Highborn never stops having a use for a pure mage character. It can essentially act as a free fast mana refill during a fight (unless you are habitually running out of mana still every fight, then a once a day quick fill isn't helpful.

Will concede that it doesn't see much at for me anymore as a pure mage at level 80, but it was worth it at low levels fighting hard enemies and it's general use makes it applicable to many situations
I think racial abilities in general are to give you an edge early on. I will agree though that berserk rage is the best racial ability, hands down.
>You don't need to regen your magicka if you have 100% cost reduction, which you should.

oh, my bad, didn't know a singleplayer game had rules i had to follow
    Non-sequitur is your racial ability!
You forgot nightvision for khajits, friend. Me thinks it is very handy sometimes… although me prefers the warmth of a torch in this cold bitten land.
    May you walk on warm sands.
        Brrrrr, this place is freezing… this one thinks he needs an extra fur, while wearing 4 already… 

(T-shirt, jersey and jacket all at once indoors and still getting chills, for real… and no I’m not khajit IRL)
            Darnit, I was going to say I have coins for your wares.
                Khajit has no wares, the nords bought everything… and threatened to turn this one into a rug. This one thought ”No thank you.”
            The cold never bothered me anyway!
    I wish the night vision was better. For me it almost never actually helps me see anything it just washes out the color.
        The natural vision of khajit is good, but could be better. This one thinks the warmth of a torch is good when out there, but when sneaking by enemies, the nightvision is very useful, although a bit… dark too. It is what it is, this one wishes he could modify it but natural things are what they are meant to be, yes?
        It used to be very useful on Morrowind and Oblivion, but Skyrim has all caves anf dungeons with good illumination
    No, I did not forget that. Night Eye is the Racial POWER not ability. Racial Abilities are static (meaning they are always on) while the Racial Power has to be activated, just like Shouts have to be activated.
I'm pretty sure it's displayed as 15 damage for Khajiits in-game, but you actually do 12 damage. Also basic unarmed is 4 damage.
This is the page on it: https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unarmed_Combat
    No, you actually do 15 points of damage, like the ability says. I am pretty sure the basic punch does five damage, not four.
        >†The in-game text states that the Claws passive ability adds 15 points to Khajiits' unarmed damage, but the actual effect magnitude is 12. The game data also describes the effect as "Khajiit claws do four times the damage of a man's punch", which is incorrect, as it is actually 5.5 times the damage.
Oh man got to love a PunchCat playthrough.
Gotta love a racial that incentivizes avoiding gaining xp from early fights.
I've still never completed the Dragonborn DLC in all this time, oof
    I've never gone to Solstheim or whatever the island is called
Okay, I *literally* just found out that Night Eye is a lesser power, so it can be used multiple times a day instead of one, which is how I thought it worked. Now I need to make a Khajiit thief with that in mind
    This one would recommend that Khajiit avoid being a thief, unless Khajiit is smarter than a nord and is not caught. Khajiit will give this one much trouble if Khajiit is caught and idiot nords tighten security.
I don’t like the green tint of the night vision
    Night vision was much easier to see stuff in Oblivion. I don't like it in Skyrim at all.
    [Subtle Night Eye](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13091) fixes that.
Punchcats are a blast to play though
You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people.
    Khajiit is innocent of this crime!  
(Also, make a punchcat. They're fun!)
        Reminds me of my kitty nightblade from ESO: Miouch. If I ever play that game properly, at least I don't have to waste a few hours coming up with a name.
        I really wish they were more viable in the harder difficulties cause they are very fun
Never should've come here!
YOU! REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THIS REALM OF REALITY. IMMEDIATELY!
Oho. You really shouldn’t have done that. Enjoy the view.
Stop! You have violated the law!
