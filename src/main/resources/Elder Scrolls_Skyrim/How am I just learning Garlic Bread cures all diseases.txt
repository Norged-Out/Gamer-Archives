[[How am I just learning Garlic Bread cures all diseases]]


My first playthrough years ago I was always cooking and weighing myself down with food. My current playthrough (still never finished the main quest) I have mostly avoided carrying any food because potions seem a lot more efficient. But now I see garlic breat. Weighs 0.2 as much as a cure disease potion! Are there any other foods that have cool properties I should think about carrying?

We'll cover you, sir!
        I've made the recipe out of the Elder Scrolls Cookbook, it's so yummy üòÅ
This one is more well known, but vegetable stew might be the most OP healing item in game. It‚Äôs effect stacks and heals 1 hp and 1 stamina per second for 720 seconds. Eat 5 and it‚Äôs 5 per second, and so on. Eat enough and you can almost become invincible for a fight.
    That's great. I had no idea it stacked
    This one is good, but the [Venison Stew](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Food#Venison_Stew) is even better.  It instantly restores 15 stamina on top of the same 12-minute buff to health & stamina.
        Nah fam, Vegetable Soup stacks. Thats shits OP
            My guy, [*all* the soup & stew effects stack.](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Regenerate_Health)
    I did not know that it stacks!!! Wow, thanks!! Cheers
        There‚Äôs really not much need for it to stack. 5 healing won‚Äôt do much inside a fight, and for power attacks, all you need is 1 stamina left. So just 1 Vegetable Soup should do the trick.
            Yeah, but make 300 and eat them all as you perform your first power attack, and you'll never die (during those 6 minutes).
    Indeed. Vegetable stew is super op

Gamerant got hella posts in the chamber today
Hawk feathers are lighter and easier than baking garlic bread, so I keep those on hand more than potions or food these days
    That's very useful! I got yeeted into terrain and stuck with no way of getting out. I ate something that paralyzed me. Falling and standing back up was the key, so I always make sure to carry an ingredient that paralyzes jic.

Elsweyr Fodue also increases your magicka by 100 for 720 seconds and lets your magicka regenerate 25% faster for 12 minutes, but if you're a necromage vampire, that stretches to 18 minutes with a 31% increase for magicka regen and a boost of 125 to magica.
    [This is the one, right here.](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Food#Elsweyr_Fondue)  I never bothered with any of the food/drink/cooking mechanics in Skyrim with the exception of this one.
Its the garlic breath you get afterwards, it wards off anything in the vicinity.
    Chase it with raw horker meat, ya good after that.

Any foods that give a 1 second push for stamina for 12 real minutes (720 seconds) can be especially useful. (Vegetable Soup, Crab Stew, Creamy Crab Bisque, Venison Stew or Beef Stew)

A stamina regeneration potion will certainly supply more incoming stamina than any food, but it won't prevent exhaustion. (if stamina runs out, the character will have to wait a few seconds before they have stamina to use again or else the stamina meter will flash and make a fail sound)

The per-second push of stamina from the mentioned food not only completely prevents exhaustion, but actually provides unlimited combat stamina. (since only 1 stamina is needed for a fully successful block, bash or power attack)

Even a werewolf that eats vegetable soup before transforming, will never have to wait on stamina for more claw attacks, because of that per-second push.
Wait. There's garlic bread in Skyrim?!
    Gotta make it
        You can find it in creation club homes, too.
Tundra homestead,  and ironically Bloodchill Manor..
But on the downside, it makes you fat.
    Just more cushion for the pushin‚Äô
    No, why would I get fat?

There must be something in the garlic and bread of Skyrim because if you combined Garlic and Bread in Oblivion you get Poison.
The player homes you can buy have ovens so you can graft it. Might even have a few laying around.
The Anniversary Edition gives you a farm where you can get milk once buying livestock and there‚Äôs a butter churn in the farmhouse.

Bread is easy to come by as is garlic but that is the best source of butter I‚Äôve found.
It's just like real life, what?
My wife captured a soul in a tomato that she can use to enchant stuff.
    IRL?
Meanwhile, in Skyrim...

I have a soul tomato for your wife if you're interested.
It's not a great trade, but  you know. Got to ask.
Where do you get garlic bread???
    You have to [bake it yourself.](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Food#Garlic_Bread)
So garlic bread has the same effect in Skyrim as it does irl
Oh, I'm making a pile of garlic bread for the rest of the Dawn Guard missions now. My current Nord character keeps getting Sanguinare Vampiris. Too bad you can't rub garlic on weapons for more damage!
If you like eating hawk feathers, those cure all diseases also
Makes you fat though
    Bread makes you fat?!
        only if you don't run 10k every day.
        Uh, yeah.  It's pure carbohydrate.
            Where do people get their information?  Remember all that *gluten* in bread that people were trying to avoid last decade?  100% protein.
                I hope you were trolling.  

Typical breads [contain 4-6x or more carbohydrates](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=76&contentid=18069-5) than protein.
Whatttttttttt
I‚Äôve been there too ü§£ always finding new things 10+ years later üëç game is awesome, especially thanks to the modders that add to it
Your parents didn't teach you right is how
Even if you‚Äôre a vampire?
I like using mudcrab legs and boiled cream treats because of their healing to weight, but if you are making good potions, that's not an issue.

Hawk Feathers also cure disease, but Garlic Bread tastes better lol.

Not food, but Netch Jelly can paralyze you if you eat it, and you don't take fall damage while paralyzed, so it can be useful if you are fast enough and fall off a cliff or something.

A couple of the soups have benefits over time, one does stamina and as long as you have at least one point of stamina you can power attack or bash, IIRC. 720 seconds of unlimited power attacks is nice.

To be honest, all you gotta do is just walk up to a shrine to cure your illnesses.
I didn't know that. Thanks for the tip. Time to visit Olive Garden!
You fucking what!?
Does it cure Vampirism?
    So long as you only have the Sanguinare Vampiris disease, then yes. The moment that you allow that disease to turn into full vampirism, then no, the bread or a cure disease potion will no longer work for it
Pretty sure that‚Äôs an anniversary edition addition
The coffee mod is *really* fun and useful
Instantly orders Dominoes Garlic Bread
How Am I just learning that garlic bread exists
A Vigilant of Stendarr‚Äôs favorite snack!

I usually don't know I have a disease until someone says something. Then I cure it right away
Cooked leeks are the most powerful healing per pound food item.
