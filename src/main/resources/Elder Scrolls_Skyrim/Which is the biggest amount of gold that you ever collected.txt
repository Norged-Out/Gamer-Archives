[[Which is the biggest amount of gold that you ever collected]]


So, my gf is obsessed with collecting gold in every game possible. We're playing a long run together in Skyrim and she use to spend a lot of hours selling items. 


About 625,416.  Approximately.
    What are the odds, my all-time record of gold on my 10-year old save which I still grind daily is 625,417 Gold.
        I sold two buckets I was saving for retirement.  Retirement buckets, if you will.  625,418.
            Thats weird because I have collected 625,419!
                Damn I have collected 625,420
                    Ahh I jus told my latest harvest and got 625,421
                        You guys just reminded me of Left 4 Dead's safe rooms.
                    nice!
                Woah oh my god dude calm down on the grinding, i dont think you need 6.18 * 10^3353422 gold
                    Lol!  r/unexpectedfactorial
    Damn, I have to grind harder
        And grinder harder I will!
In my first playthrough, it was over 1,000,000, though I don't remember the exact number.
    Oh that's a lot of chopped wood
        A lot of potions of waterbreathing
i actually have a save with 2.5mil. i’m obsessive and refuse to buy anything that i can’t barter for, i come away from every transaction with more money
    I do similar. If I can't buy it and still milk them for every penny they own I'm not buying
    Me and the shrine of Zenithar are very close
Player.additem f 100000000
    To this day i still type it 000000f
        The 0 enjoyer move
        Wholesome
        when I found out you could omit the zeros in it I shamed my younger self for being so STUPID
            Nah. No need to feel stupid. It's not like it's obvious.
        You dont have to type any 0's it will work
    Honestly I used money cheats only in total war
    I just do additem f 999999
I only ever got about 270-280 thousand, though I knew a friend who was up to 5 million
Genuinely surprised people rarely pass a million, I've gotten about 2 mil from selling potions.
    I frequently walk around with 7 million or so.  Yes, it's the potions.  I bankrupt every merchant with them.
At least 260K.
On hand probably around 175,000 

Total I have no idea. I just stop collecting/trading at a certain point
    It's useless after a while (imo) since there are a limited number of houses or farms you can buy/build
        If it’s so useless then why can’t I stop farming gold? Checkmate, atheists.

(I think the most I’ve carried was a little over 2M, and the total collected for that playthrough was over 4M. And no, I still cant stop myself from hoarding gold. Like a dragon!)
            Man I would love to own like 10 or more farms. Why Bethesda won't let us have some fun??
                Because the game is one a half decades old and whats in game was fucking huge at the time

I've said it before but I really hope an actually housing market is part of the new elder scrolls game. Like dozens of homes for sale and the prices vary depending on availability and what's going on in that city at that time. You can buy or sell and even haggle prices. Buy a broken down piece of shit house and rebuild it then even add your trophies to it to make it nice then sell it for a huge profit
                    TES: Landlord simulator
                Starfield is the first time I've played a Bethesda game where I always needed money and didn't have 1mil+ gold. I'm always buying ships, ship parts, outpost materials, and ammo.
            Imagine carrying that much on a pvp game
        However useless it may become, my obsessive nature compels me to continue collecting and trading. I'm somewhere in the 3m plus. On my current playthrough I have about 250k atm.
Bro.... that's not even the total amount of (money I've earned + money I've spent + money I currently have <all separately>)
I have a several years old save. I can’t remember what I was doing on it anymore but I logged in a week ago for shits and giggles and had around 6M gold. I pick up every gold piece I come across and habitually sell gear I no longer use or display. Only thing I keep is gems. I have a chest full of hundreds of thousands of every gem
    I keep my gems too, my safe in Proudspire has 500 gold ingots and hundreds of gems
        Yeah idk why I keep them but I do. I keep mine in my whiterun house in the little metal chest by the door
            I keep them bc they're my precious😳 or else nasty hobbitses will take them
                lol, hey man as long as your having a good time that’s all that matters. Why we keep anything we keep don’t matter as long as it’s fun
You gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers
About 300k.
The thieves guild once fully upgraded and farming gold there is insane. I don't remember the number I  had but it was a little over a million. Granted it was a pretty long play session.
    I've to finish the secondary missions of the guild..
        Definitely worth it. Stupid amount of gold lol
            I remember on my Morrowind and maybe Oblivion playthrough I stole everything that wasn't nailed to the ground
On my longest playthrough I reached the milion gold
Daedric Armor looks very neato. What mod is that?
    It’s anniversary edition Daedric plate I believe it’s called
        Yeah, I guess so. I suck at remembering names lmao
        Damn they are trying to make me buy Skyrim again!
    No mode at all, I've found a lot of armour and weapons through the game.
My current main file has 2.8mil on it. It's slightly cheating since I have a mod giving all vendors 17500g when invested in, but that's still a lot of paralysis poisons.
    I dont consider those mods cheating. Quality of life honestly. The amount of gold that vanilla merchants carry is laughable.
        Absolutely. 

Ordinator contributes as well. Green Thumb doubling the amount of ingredients per plant is insane. Greenhouse plots give 8 canis root per plot and 6 swamp fungal pod. 54 potions per 3 days, doubled by another perk, Double Toil and Trouble.
        The amount of stuff you can carry to sell to them is also laughable, it's just a balance thing
            I mostly only pick up loot that has a 15:1 value to weight ratio, it's still hard to manage I'm just always selling things
                I'm also above 10:1, doesn't matter though you still end up carrying the equivalent of a 4 person house
The way that middle weapon is hanging on the wall is bothering me.
    Ikr?
Roughly 300k each in Skyrim and Fallout 3
Yo, can I borrow 20 bucks?
    Sorry no but I can send you 1000 septims. What's your name in Skyrim? I'll send it over on the next dragon attack. Just use Bendwill and Sneak to take it from his inventory. The last guy just killed my messenger and stole his bones and scales without wo much as a thank you in return.
360K
100k or something
I have more gold this walk though than I've EVER had, about 96k.  Seeing this 625k makes me want to beat you just for the heck of it, hold on gimme like a month
One a single character? Maybe 2 mil and still going when I decide to play her
Just below 80k somewhere, that was way back on PS3 though
1 Million. I have a mod where you unlock a kingssword when reaching 1 mill, wasn’t worth it tho 😬
    Did you encountered any bug with the mods? I would like to try some of the graphic upgrades but I'm afraid to lose my save or something like that
        No everything went perfect but honestly I’m the wrong person to talk about this to. I never understood modding  well enough to use complex mods so I just used very simple and standard mods. The mod I used worked perfectly but it was the only mod in my collection adding something new so it didn’t „fight“ with other mods doing similar things. Definitely hard save before modding :)
One of my favorite things to do is to not only be able to afford to give my followers the very best gear, but also to leave them with a nice chunk of change in their pocket after they've helped me for awhile, and it (among a few other habits that are fun to me but not necessary) keeps me from building up giant sums like this
    Once I gave a full set of armour to Serana cuz I was full of stuff. Made a fast travel and noticed that she wore it immediately. The value of the armour was like 15k in total but she looked so cute so I decided to make her a "gift"!
About 800k, and still have the save, but now i have 600k
About 800k, and still have the save, but now i have 600k
First playthrough, and I ended up with a few hundred thousand.
7.2 million
    Wuuut? How many hours did you spend playing?
        5 years, plus I collected and sold every dragon bone, enchanted weapon, and gem I found.
Never really focused on it explicitly. Always just wanted enough to buy the houses when playing through. 

420,000 is the most on this last play through. 

The anniversary edition is much easier to amass gold.
I'm at 160,000 with 3 houses and still stacking
    Buy the farm!
I have at least 608,450 i think, havent played in years
Make enough carry weight potions and you’ll make it
    I've started creating potions just a few weeks ago...
Highest I ever had at once without cheats was 1.2 million, granted I had a mod which boosted the amount of money merchants had 4 times
1,000,000

And that's by using the invisible chest exploit
    I would like to know more...
        Yeah I used the invisible chest exploit and just sold all I took from the chests. Soon enough I had thar amount.
Max gold
    4,294,967,295 is the max because the games bits can't handle more
Legit? My current playthrough is at 325,798
25k, for the solitude house. Hehe
Has she ever tried it in the game of life? Could be beneficial!
I had over 1M through Berenziah quest, transmutation, smithing, enchanting, speech, and the shop keeper glitch.
    What's the shop keeper glitch?
        Quick save, attack the shop keeper, reload save, and the shop keeper should have inventory and gold reset.
I had a great farm of paralysis poison, and the mod nff let you give items to companions for them to sell at full price. I had about 2000000 gold before the save got corrupted
I'm usually over a million on every character I play before around level 30 or so 🤷. I always use https://www.powtions.com/ingredients.  To make the most expensive potions. I level up my Enchanting and Smithing to 100 and make the most expensive weapons possible. Then when I sell items I buy all ingredients or ore and anything else I can use from the merchant so that they have more septims.
    Thanks! I will give it a try!
114
    Bro...
        I am not financially responsible
            Me but irl
I’ve got 50k in a chest in Breezehome and I think 75k on me
It all really depends for me. With no mod, I use the money I get from the Thieves Guild and The Dark Brotherhood, along with stolen goods, and I can get to 800-950K. I always have enough to buy the houses in each hold, and then build the other houses. 

WITH a mod, you can easily get to 1 million. At the start of the game, find the “mod cash” in the tree stump, it’s a good amount.
like 300k
On one playthrough I have about 2 million. No console commands
My current character has like 1.5 million right now.
I didn’t bother much with golds, just do some restoration potion glitch exploit and make all the equipments worth like a billion or something
A little less than 500k for me.. I can't break that threshold.. I keep spending before i hit it
Recently hit 100k, running out of stuff to buy
4 million
Dragonborn gallery has a vault that will fill up as you add gold, i dumped alot into that
I never paid attention past the early game. Once your enchanting gets going you can sell an iron dagger or gold ring and pay for anything you want in the game so money becomes a non issue.
65k
DROP IT
I currently have in the neighborhood of 860k. I have a mid that gives a carry weight bonus for every stone of Barenziah I picked up, and I got all 24, so my carry weight between that and enchantments is 1125. I grab every gem and enchanted item I find to sell. I grab every loose septum and check all cabinets for gold too. I haven't spent money on anything but building materials for my homesteads for in-game months.
Enough, and it was mostly gained by picking pockets and selling gems
Idk, but for a guy that spent almost the entire save file holed up in a former witch’s cabin, I made all the jarls look like peasants by comparison.
    It's funny cuz all the jarls use to behave like cunts but little they know I own big ass houses in all the regions
Atm, I'm at 1,204,573
27000 had to buy the house and all the stuff for it
200k, my most recent playthrough which still has a lot of quests yet untouched..
maybe like six or seven? no nevermind that one fell through the floor
In my current playthrough I have the most on hand I’ve ever collected, roughly 2.5 million septims & about double that total collected. No exploits, only Anniversary Edition DLCs, but acquiring Goldenhill Plantation early on helps.
I think it was like half a million. It wasn't through any sort of grinding or anything. Just, all of a sudden some enemies had like 26 thousand gold in their inventory. It wasn't even important enemies or rich characters. It was just common enemies like bandits, Miraak cult members, spiders, etc. Didn't even have mods or anything, and it was on console so Idk wtf happened.

It wasn't very common though. Just had the occasional enemy have the CEO of Apple as their day job.
Without doing any kind of glitch or mod stuff, probably only like 50k lol. I never cared about saving it up, im not really sure how you’d earn that much normally.
Over 3 million currently
I still need 100k for the damn trophy lol
All im gonna say... Intger overflow
It's never enough
if mods count, 16 million 
well over a million
Only kept like 10k coin on me at once but I had about 45k stashed next to my spoons at breeze home
Without mods? Prolly around 8 or 900K. With mods? Millions & Millions lol... 😎🤑🪙
before i found a straight up absurd amount of cash..1632 just on a random npc
my mom has 3 million in her pocket and total was like 5 million, idfk how but she figured it out
A long run together? Are you two playing that Skyrim multiplayer mod or are you both playing your own singleplayer games? Either way, you two are very cute.
    Thank you! Basically we're playing on my laptop. Sometimes she watches me playing (and give me orders) and sometimes she takes the controller and starts looting lmao
        That is so precious! I bet they're dying to do a playthrough of their own 😂. You might have to fulfill your Todd Howard quota and buy another copy of Skyrim for them.
            She owns an Xbox series S but usually plays stealth games like Prey or Dishonored 😅
Unmodded: 100,000 approx. it was in the six digit range but I don’t remember exactly how much because I lost that save. 

Modded: 1,000,000 atm. I utilize a few mods: 

1.) Notice boards mod: which not only gives new miscellaneous quests but also increases the bounties for completion because I thought vanilla rewards were pretty cheap. 

2.) bags and bandoliers: what the name implies adds wearable bags, bandoliers, satchels, sacks, and pouches. A single large bandolier = 100 carry weight combined with 6 waist pouches = 50 carry weight per pouch. It really helps with carrying gear and butt loads of trinkets. 

3.) multiple rings: allows up to ten rings to be worn but each has to be unique. 

4.) Odin Magic: adds 100+ new lore-friendly spells

5.) dragon hearts: when kill a dragon, loot its corpse for one dragon heart. Consumer it to get one perk point. 

6.) just a landscape and texture pack that’s it. 

So you can probably see how the utilization these particular mods gives a boost to gold hoarding!
Currently sitting at 5,136,024 gold (and no I haven't even started to find the stones of Barenziah)

This playthrough was an alchemist/smith/enchanter/hunter-gatherer who was living a humble life trading. I literally started this character only a couple months ago. Gold mostly came from me using the "fuck you, pay me" loop on Enthir to dump my potions and pick up black soul gems and daedra hearts, using fortify barter potions to get past his high prices.

They were just a humble triple threat alchemist, blacksmith, and enchanter who spent the first hundred levels selling goods across Skyrim. It was only after meeting the Ebony Warrior that they started adventuring, by which point I'm pretty sure they were already a millionaire, although they kept the first 1,001,001 gold in the house safe for emergencies. That was around lvl 90, the character is now lvl 251 with a little over 5 mil in gold.

After hitting lvl 251 and 5 mil, they finally retired to their house, wife, and kids.

Basically, alchemy+smithing+enchanting=profit
Negative integer.
At least 12
I have almost 3 million if I remember correctly. I pickup and sell EVERYTHING
    2 million here. I do exactly the same thing. “A million gems you say? Yeees. That’ll do nicely”
    Daaaamn
Considering you can "collect" any amount you want in mere seconds I'm not sure a screenshot matters.
    I've never used cheats in Skyrim. I posted my screenshot just to have a conversation since I like the blog.
Ps3, max I had at once was ~320k
I had over 2 million with one character, but I had the mod that gives merchants 10k gold, and kept making and selling potions.
On my last play through I ended up with almost 700 million by the end of it because LotD’s sell cart is crazy broken. I installed a few money sink mods but literally nothing could drain my treasury because of that stupid cart.
In vanilla? Probably 30k back in the day

But there was this onetime I had a castle mod that displayed all your gold in different vaults so grinded well over a million with modded stuff
1 mil for retirement been playing for to long
On my person, 444k. At one of my houses, a couple million.

You are carrying a ridiculous number of septims.
I’ve got a character with about 500,000 but they also have about 1.4 million worth of gems sitting in a chest. I was playing a thief who just collects gems but doesn’t sell them, so I kept every single one I found during the whole game
Bro I have squabbled away almost 1,000,000 gold at this point on console.
Got my first million not long ago. Had no idea why I got rich all of the sudden (assumed it was high level loot) but it was completing stones of barenziah and getting loaded on gems
Idk when i think i have too much i just dump it in one of my houses, pretty sure i have over 120k
Everytime I get north of 60k I feel absurd, like I'm hoarding gold. I try my best not to hoard, because I end up never using any consumables. Which usually escalates to hoarding of all items. I have to try to practice Buddhism, and let shit go lol.
Master alchemy and be a full on forager. You'll be rich in no time
Sir ur mace is leaving the plaque
400k by selling gems to a fence after completing the crown of barenziah
I'm at about 1.4m now and counting
Gold I've amassed over a million, but my real treasure is my gem storage. 

I have hundreds of Garnets, Rubies, Sapphires, Diamonds, Emeralds, I saved them all.
Like 300k or so.
700g+ lots of trading and abuse of animals in dawnstar
With the immersive armors mod installed, you can make gold earrings out of 120 septim and then smelt it into a gold bar worth 110 septim (net loss 10 septim per bar).

When I get real rich I make hundreds of ingots and put them in a safe. Feels awesome AF to open a safe and see multiple hundreds of gold ingots. So short answer - not sure haha
I've currently got over 300 million, but I'm using the East Empire Expansion. They sell stuff for you and you take a cut, so my potions that are worth 100 million net me 1 million each. 

I've started reverse pickpocketing a million gold onto homeless people.
I got the achievement for breaking a million. That was the game I invested the most time into.
I still have my first save, that is, the save from the first time i played Skyrim, around 2013. 

It's crazy how time goes by.

I must be around 2M.
Do you guys spend money in Skyrim? I think i've bought a house once in one playtrough, but i don't ever spend it
    Mostly clean out vendors for ingredients and ingots in anticipation of going legendary on apothecary and smithing. Just easier than foraging/mining for it.
About tree fiddy
A couple of million I think
200k or so
I'm a bit wild at collecting. So I always leave the stores empty of gold, selling off as much as they can afford to buy.

Actual gold right now? Don't remember. Need to start the game to check.

But yhere has been quite a number of cleaned out dungeons...
I’m at 5m currently. Bit pointless though.
1000000. Plus 300? of each of the 8? gem types. Obviously Barenziah was involved. And yes, it was a grind. My Very Serious playthrough had become Very Silly by that point. So I figured why not go for a million.
About 20-25k, I think I collected/used most of it to buy a modded home
42 million currently.
Uh.... I'd have to check my stashes in Solitude... and Breezehome... and Myrwatch.... and the Arch Mage Quarters.... and the Lake Manor.... and The Dark Brotherhood hideout... and DID I REALLY leave 60,000 gold in the fucking THIEVES GUILD?!?
Without exploiting any funny systems, I think my highest was about 200,000 at one time. 

With some cheeky potion methods I got my gold count so high (2.4 billion) it went into the negatives.
I’m at over £115m
too busy spending to count
I Console command gold nowadays
793152
too busy spending to count
too busy spending to count
Just over a million on one of my playthroughs
The most gold I have ever held at a time was 669,696
Well over 10 million, once I'd completed the Crown of Barenziah.

Took a long-ass time to sell all those jewels though.
Oh, I have no idea. I stop paying attention to my money after it consistently stays above 5000
1.5 million
I honestly don’t even remember it’s been years
More than I could spend, I think I could buy everything from everyone ever sold and still have more than enough to probably do it again several times more
Probably well over 7 figures.
I spend all my gold on sweetrolls and stamina potions.
Around 600 000$ as well, but much, much more worth in potion waiting in my inventory and at home. It became to tedious to sell absolutely absurd amount of potion to make more gold.
I think the most I’ve gotten is around 6-8,000 gold
80k i think? Once im done buying training and stuff i mostly stop bothering selling stuff
The most I've ever had was 1,467,767 that was just wandering around and selling
Over 300k
I have $3.2M in my main game. I have a very OCD approach to this game - explore a dungeon, kill all the bad guys and loot their bodies,  kill and loot the boss, then thoroughly search and loot the dungeon. Then carry all the loot back to town and sell it, keeping whatever strikes my fancy and storing it in one of my houses.
A little  over 120,000 gold. Which I immediately spent on crafting items to get my enchanting level up.
Like 150k I spend a lot of money everywhere. Ingredients are my addiction same with ore
Actual gold in my inventory, only like 100k. But I had a chest in my house dedicated to any gems I found, which after long enough with Prowler's Profit, amounted to a couple million.
Legit saved about 5 mil but I have  auto looter mod so idk I’ve only done 3 million by picking everything and everything up myself.
In the millions. I have had a playthrough I had at least over 3 million with me and currently still rocking almost 2.5 million and counting. No weird loops, no weird cheats. All while even running a mod that lowers quest rewards (Reasonable Quest Rewards), lowering rewards from basic fetch and delivery quests all the way down to a minimum of 10% (or below 100 gold) instead of often 100s or 1000s of gold.
Without mods I once made it to a million gold as a goal, never doing that again, I do usually end up with at least a few hundred grand by the end of most play throughs.
50K. I only play on the PS3
1.3 Billion
    This can only be done easily with the original vanilla without updates
Around 700k is the most I’ve collected without exploits. But with exploits….thats another story 😅
I usually hit a million right about level 80, which is also when I typically wrap up a character.
player.additem f (number) Got an achievement like this, very lol
On PS5, the level 252 Argonian I started a month ago has 1.3 million septims.
i think i have around 250000 on my current save and that’s my highest
A little over 4 million this run through.
That I can think of probably 600,000 or 60,000, that's on a recent playthrough I've had more in my earlier plays
2.8 Million.
Had that farm near Rorikstead and maxed it Out?
Anyways, i completly forgott about it and played a decend amount of hours in that save, while my farm generated a Shit Ton of gold in the Background.

After what i can think is a Year in skyrims time i randomly stumbeled across my farm and well, running the Farm for a Year in Skyrim pays.
I'm currently at $13.4 mil. but have prolonged the game for a few reasons.
Not to brag but I killed the emperor and received 25,000 septims..
I’m going for the 100k trophy this time. So it’s coming
Around 1.1M gold. Worked hard on that I'll tell you what
700k in gold with probably an additional 500k in gems and wgatever else i have in my "To-sell" safe that never gets sold
I had over two million in my Legacy of the Dragonborn run.  You had to do that to have all the decorations in the Solitude museum vault to appear.
While testing some stuff I gave myself quite a lot of gold but I'm not sure how much it was. If cheating doesn't count then maybe around 100k
Without glitches, I think like 40k
I’ve had over 1 million
Damn, I just closed Skyrim and got into bed, otherwise I'd have checked. This current playthrough I've got going on has been going for about a year now, playing as an Imperial. Got over 1.5m Septims I believe. I'll have to check at some point.
100,000 for the achievement
With the newer east empire expansion creation, my current save is up to almost 6 million
With the power of console commands any number is possible.
    Yeah but imo there's no satisfaction playing like that
200.000 something
I had over 3M on my first character on the X360.  Of course, on the PC with a console command........
Only like 100k but my current playthrough I've collected all the stones now I'm having a hard time recycling the gems for septims
I had over 1 mil once
All of it
12 septims.  
Whenever I get more I blow it all on mead an sweetrolls.
If I were to add all gold between all the systems I own skyrim on, it'd be well over 3mil
Something like 300k but I always have around 1,000,000 worth of gems I’m too lazy to cash in
A couple mil tbh.

Was playing modded, but kinda just cheesed myself millions through exploiting vendors and alchemy. Got it all technically through vanilla means and did the same on my switch but tbh kinda broke the game
What are the odds, my all-time record of gold on my 10-year old save which I still grind daily is 625,417 Gold.
    I sold two buckets I was saving for retirement.  Retirement buckets, if you will.  625,418.
        Thats weird because I have collected 625,419!
            Damn I have collected 625,420
                Ahh I jus told my latest harvest and got 625,421
                    You guys just reminded me of Left 4 Dead's safe rooms.
                nice!
            Woah oh my god dude calm down on the grinding, i dont think you need 6.18 * 10^3353422 gold
                Lol!  r/unexpectedfactorial
Damn, I have to grind harder
    And grinder harder I will!
Oh that's a lot of chopped wood
    A lot of potions of waterbreathing
I do similar. If I can't buy it and still milk them for every penny they own I'm not buying
Me and the shrine of Zenithar are very close
To this day i still type it 000000f
    The 0 enjoyer move
    Wholesome
    when I found out you could omit the zeros in it I shamed my younger self for being so STUPID
        Nah. No need to feel stupid. It's not like it's obvious.
    You dont have to type any 0's it will work
Honestly I used money cheats only in total war
I just do additem f 999999
I frequently walk around with 7 million or so.  Yes, it's the potions.  I bankrupt every merchant with them.
It's useless after a while (imo) since there are a limited number of houses or farms you can buy/build
    If it’s so useless then why can’t I stop farming gold? Checkmate, atheists.

(I think the most I’ve carried was a little over 2M, and the total collected for that playthrough was over 4M. And no, I still cant stop myself from hoarding gold. Like a dragon!)
        Man I would love to own like 10 or more farms. Why Bethesda won't let us have some fun??
            Because the game is one a half decades old and whats in game was fucking huge at the time

I've said it before but I really hope an actually housing market is part of the new elder scrolls game. Like dozens of homes for sale and the prices vary depending on availability and what's going on in that city at that time. You can buy or sell and even haggle prices. Buy a broken down piece of shit house and rebuild it then even add your trophies to it to make it nice then sell it for a huge profit

            Starfield is the first time I've played a Bethesda game where I always needed money and didn't have 1mil+ gold. I'm always buying ships, ship parts, outpost materials, and ammo.
        Imagine carrying that much on a pvp game
    However useless it may become, my obsessive nature compels me to continue collecting and trading. I'm somewhere in the 3m plus. On my current playthrough I have about 250k atm.
I keep my gems too, my safe in Proudspire has 500 gold ingots and hundreds of gems
    Yeah idk why I keep them but I do. I keep mine in my whiterun house in the little metal chest by the door
        I keep them bc they're my precious😳 or else nasty hobbitses will take them
            lol, hey man as long as your having a good time that’s all that matters. Why we keep anything we keep don’t matter as long as it’s fun
I've to finish the secondary missions of the guild..
    Definitely worth it. Stupid amount of gold lol
        I remember on my Morrowind and maybe Oblivion playthrough I stole everything that wasn't nailed to the ground
It’s anniversary edition Daedric plate I believe it’s called
    Yeah, I guess so. I suck at remembering names lmao
    Damn they are trying to make me buy Skyrim again!
No mode at all, I've found a lot of armour and weapons through the game.
I dont consider those mods cheating. Quality of life honestly. The amount of gold that vanilla merchants carry is laughable.
    Absolutely. 

Ordinator contributes as well. Green Thumb doubling the amount of ingredients per plant is insane. Greenhouse plots give 8 canis root per plot and 6 swamp fungal pod. 54 potions per 3 days, doubled by another perk, Double Toil and Trouble.
    The amount of stuff you can carry to sell to them is also laughable, it's just a balance thing
        I mostly only pick up loot that has a 15:1 value to weight ratio, it's still hard to manage I'm just always selling things
            I'm also above 10:1, doesn't matter though you still end up carrying the equivalent of a 4 person house
Ikr?
Sorry no but I can send you 1000 septims. What's your name in Skyrim? I'll send it over on the next dragon attack. Just use Bendwill and Sneak to take it from his inventory. The last guy just killed my messenger and stole his bones and scales without wo much as a thank you in return.
Did you encountered any bug with the mods? I would like to try some of the graphic upgrades but I'm afraid to lose my save or something like that
    No everything went perfect but honestly I’m the wrong person to talk about this to. I never understood modding  well enough to use complex mods so I just used very simple and standard mods. The mod I used worked perfectly but it was the only mod in my collection adding something new so it didn’t „fight“ with other mods doing similar things. Definitely hard save before modding :)
Once I gave a full set of armour to Serana cuz I was full of stuff. Made a fast travel and noticed that she wore it immediately. The value of the armour was like 15k in total but she looked so cute so I decided to make her a "gift"!
Wuuut? How many hours did you spend playing?
    5 years, plus I collected and sold every dragon bone, enchanted weapon, and gem I found.
Buy the farm!
I've started creating potions just a few weeks ago...
I would like to know more...
    Yeah I used the invisible chest exploit and just sold all I took from the chests. Soon enough I had thar amount.
4,294,967,295 is the max because the games bits can't handle more
What's the shop keeper glitch?
    Quick save, attack the shop keeper, reload save, and the shop keeper should have inventory and gold reset.
Thanks! I will give it a try!
Bro...
    I am not financially responsible
        Me but irl
It's funny cuz all the jarls use to behave like cunts but little they know I own big ass houses in all the regions
Thank you! Basically we're playing on my laptop. Sometimes she watches me playing (and give me orders) and sometimes she takes the controller and starts looting lmao
    That is so precious! I bet they're dying to do a playthrough of their own 😂. You might have to fulfill your Todd Howard quota and buy another copy of Skyrim for them.
        She owns an Xbox series S but usually plays stealth games like Prey or Dishonored 😅
2 million here. I do exactly the same thing. “A million gems you say? Yeees. That’ll do nicely”
Daaaamn
I've never used cheats in Skyrim. I posted my screenshot just to have a conversation since I like the blog.
Mostly clean out vendors for ingredients and ingots in anticipation of going legendary on apothecary and smithing. Just easier than foraging/mining for it.
This can only be done easily with the original vanilla without updates
Yeah but imo there's no satisfaction playing like that
I sold two buckets I was saving for retirement.  Retirement buckets, if you will.  625,418.
    Thats weird because I have collected 625,419!
        Damn I have collected 625,420
            Ahh I jus told my latest harvest and got 625,421
                You guys just reminded me of Left 4 Dead's safe rooms.
