[[RIP Christopher Plummer. The voice actor of Arngeir.]]





We'll meet again in Sovngarde, brother.
    We raise our mugs in your honor
        ["Raise your mug to the legends of the frost, through our voices they will never be lost"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FLQ4rACE-0)
            Indeed brother.
    Wind guide you
    See you soon, Master...

*kneels at his Tombstone.*
        Went from sad to Sad ultra instinct
            Heh, thanks.
    Valhalla! oops I mean let's meet again in Sovngarde
    I‚Äôm about to buy a strong whiskey tomorrow to celebrate his life
"Sky above. Voice within."
    "Sky guard you. Wind guide you. "
        Wind Guide You is also a great song from the soundtrack
            Every song is also a great song from the soundtrack
                He speak da true-true
    Arngeir? I didn‚Äôt know that was him. Damn.
        I remember watching the credits for Skyrim after beating the MQ the first time, looking him up, some of his other work, then not being able to unhear it.
            I haven‚Äôt watch many movies as I have been working two jobs a majority of my adult life, so I haven‚Äôt seen many films. I would rather spend my time playing video games. Especially with Plummet in it. I had time off with the family and watched Knives Out, which I thought he was excellent in. I didn‚Äôt connect the two voices at all. 

When Max Von Sydow passed I knew it was him as his voice is distinct. I instantly knew he voiced Esbern after watching Game of Thrones. (The first role I seen of him, and of course The Force Awakens)

Definitely sad when someone who I spent several hours (hundreds lol) hearing is gone. At least he had a long, and successful career.
                >	The first role I seen of him, and of course The Force Awakens

Evidently I'm getting old, he'll always be the Exorcist to me. Although his character in Minority Report is also great.
                    Damn. I need to see that movie.
                        Also if you haven't, watch Seventh Seal.  A totally transcendent film experience.  Absolutely an all time great.
                You owe it to yourself to check out Max von Sydow's body of work beyond more recent stuff. Some quality stuff in there if you're slightly film buff'y.
                Yep. Did you mean sydow, not snow?
                    Fixed
            There are credits after the main quest? I never saw that
                There's a main quest after oh hey what's that over there...
                    Lol, that's exactly the reason why I never finshed the main quest line in my 500 hours of playing skyrim.
                        Took me literally over two years, but the main quest is worth playing.
                            Is the main quest Alduin or the civil war bro?
                                Alduin.
                You access them in settings, I think. I just didn't watch them until I finished the main story
        [deleted]
    His legacy truly lives on.
        He's immortal.
    I was gonna say "Breath and focus." 

I'm sad about his passing. Ive played so much Skyrim that he was like a proxy grandpa to me. I always keep "Breath and focus" in the back of my mind, just to remind myself.
        Lowkey been thinking of getting a breath and focus tattoo in the dragon language
        It's not a particularly unique line, I've heard it countless times both in real life and in other media, but for some reason it's my favorite version and like you it stuck in my mind. Maybe it's the short and concise phrasing, or the cadence.
            It's very buddhist sounding to me, and, of all the weird mantras people have to keep themselves sane, this one seems better than most. Arngeir says it all the time, but when he talks to you after your final boss battle with Alduin Christopher Plummer puts a special emphasis on the words.  Like "see? Told ya so!" But in a loving way that acknowledges how far you had come to reach that point. It's just a small vocal inflection that Plummer did that made it different from the other times Arngeir says it, but it told me everything I needed to hear. I love quality voice acting.
    "Breath and focus."
    "Wind, guide you."
    Love that quote
 "We are the Greybeards, followers of the Way of the Voice. You stand in High Hrothgar, on the  slopes of Kynareth's sacred mountain. Here we commune with the voice of the sky, and strive to achieve balance between our inner and outer  selves."  -Arngeir
    I couldn‚Äôt picture who he was because it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve actually gone to the greybeards but reading that brought me back immediately
    A playthrough with the bulk of his lines: https://youtu.be/wrP_q8LUZcU?t=68
    Finna make us cry bro???
He taught me the voiceüò¢
    he leveled up my sneak
        ...how?
            make difficulty legendary, go behind him, sneak, take off all armour and hit. keep hitting. stop when he turns back or you get detected.
                Holy fuck i had no idea putting the difficulty to legendary made you level up faster, that would've saved me so much time
                    Well, kinda. You can‚Äôt sneak attack downed npcs. (downed in this case meaning essential npcs who have lost all of their health). And since sneak attacks do multiplied damage, it is easy to down Arengir on a lower difficulty. Setting the game to legendary decreases the amount of damage you do, allowing you to perform more sneak attacks. So while, yes, setting your game to legendary makes levelling your sneak more efficient (as well as other combat related trees, since you have to attack a lot more often and get hit harder), setting your game to legendary does not affect the overall speed of levelling directly.
            Legendary difficulty, keep stabbing him with a dagger when he is sitting down
                "Of all the people that could have been the chosen one, it had to be this fucking guy." Arngeir, probably.
Wow. What a true legend. Thank you for almost 10 years of epic shout training.
    Literally never made this connection either. Insane how much impact this man‚Äôs voice has had on our adventures.
    Someone copied this exact comment and posted it. Lmao; but rip Arngeir
        *dies*
    I hope Bethesda gives his character a nice ‚Äúshout out‚Äù in the next game, it would be a nice way to honor him. Like in the history of Alduin‚Äôs Return, mention how he helped the DB by training them and talk about his dedication to his cause.
Blossom of snow, May you bloom and grow, Bloom and grow forever...
    Dude, you've got to cut your onions somewhere else.

I know he kind of hated the role, but his role in the Sound of Music is something I (and countless others) hold near and dear. Edelweiss is a song I think of when I need comfort. His voice to me sounds like an old friend, a loved one.

Can't believe he's gone. 91 is pretty old and I know he lived a full and accomplished life, but it still feels like it was too soon.
    I like that song, it seems weirdly applicable for this...
    Oh, fuck.  Now I'm crying.
    This really is a good incentive to finally make something with that Edelweiss knitting pattern I have and some silver-gray yarn
    This was the comment that made me cry.
I'm in the middle of my first playthrough in years, I'm heading back to High Hrothgar tonight to spend a bit of time talking to Arngeir I think. RIP.
    Wonderful. Good tribute.
    Isn't it... strange?

Chris passed away, but we can always hear his voice again when talking to Arngeir... It's like, he'll always be alive in the game.
    Same. Time to climb the 7000 steps.
 R.I.P May Talos welcome you to Soverngard The Hall of Valor. 

"In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain." \~Arngeir
I just heard this news this morning, and I'm genuinely sad about it.  Many people don't know how prolific Christopher Plummer actually was as an actor.  He played so many roles in movies, TV, games, and on stage over his lifetime.  Some of his more recent films were The Insider, A Beautiful Mind, Beginners, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and as recently as 2019 with the movie Knives Out (which is a hilariously awesome film -- it's like an Agatha Christie murder mystery turned inside-out and upside-down).  

I've been fortunate enough to see him on the stage several times as well, at the Stratford Theatre in Ontario, Canada, and he was a magnificent stage actor.  I've seen him play as Caesar in *Caesar and Cleopatra*, as Prospero in *The Tempest*, and best of all, as Lear in *King Lear.* 

By the Divines, he was amazing as Lear!  It's a Shakespeare play, and he actually played the role as if the main character (who's a king, but also an old man) was in decline with Alzheimer's.  I worked in health care for awhile and I've cared for people with Alzheimer's, and my grandfather had dementia before his death, so I'm aware of the stages, and I could literally track each stage his Lear was going through.  I've also studied the play and seen it many times, but none of those other performances came anywhere close to Plummer's.

I'm truly sad that I'll never see him take over a stage and own a character in that way again.  But the man was 91 years old, and he lived a wonderful life, so he deserves his feast in Sovngarde.  I have a feeling he's the kind of man who would probably appreciate it.   RIP, my fellow Canadian.  You were a legend.  :)
    I watched him in Knives out just last week, it may not be the deepest or most contrived of mystery dramas but it was amazingly entertaining (those 2+ hours felt like 40 min) and Plummer was a big part of that, his few scenes and his chemistry with Ana de Armas were part of what made that movie so great.
        Totally agreed, it's such a clever script, and all the actors were obviously having a blast!  (Especially Chris Evans playing an asshole instead of the good guy, lol!)
            Chris Evans is way better as a bad guy than as a hero. He‚Äôs amazing in Scott Pilgrim too.
                I think he's good at both, but he seems to enjoy playing a villain more.  That said, most actors do!
    Let's not forget "The Sound of Music"
        *The hills are aliiiiive....with the thu'um of dragons!*
            *... with songs they have sung for YOL TOOR SHUL!*

Well now you said that, I'mma need a Sound of Music set in Skyrim homage.

DISNEY, GET YER FINGERS OUT!
        "You flatter me Captain."

"Oh how clumsy of me; I meant to accuse you."

Badass line
        I might have to watch that on Disney+ tonight before watching National Treasure where he played the grandpa
    Tried to figure out why i knew him, and yet it was knives out. Great film and performance from him.
    Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.

Was I a good bot? | [info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/) | [More Books](https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/comments/i15x1d/full_list_of_books_and_commands/)
        Good bot
    I just watched sound of music a couple nights ago rip, also your from the Stratford area? Sweet I‚Äôm not too far from Stratford
        Sort of, I was living in Waterloo at the time so it was a short drive away for me, but since then we've moved to Montreal.   I do miss being able to go to Stratford and watch a play whenever I wanted (not that I could do it now anyway, in these Covid times).  We'd drive the scenic route along the backcountry roads through St. Agatha and the like.  I also tried to see the springtime swan parade in Stratford every year, haha!  Loved that event, so much fun!
            Speaking of Waterloo he was Wellington in that film.
        /u/JimLaheySunnyvale, I have found an error in your comment:

 > ‚Äúalso ~~your~~ [**you're**] from the Stratford‚Äù

I consider this post by you, JimLaheySunnyvale, wrong; it should read ‚Äúalso ~~your~~ [**you're**] from the Stratford‚Äù instead. ‚ÄòYour‚Äô is possessive; ‚Äòyou're‚Äô means ‚Äòyou are‚Äô.

 ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!)
    Do you remember anything about his Prospero performance?
        It was years ago, the production was from 2010.  However, if you want to see him for yourself, [I've timestamped this video](https://youtu.be/XZRNJeZFnQ4?t=105) of the production (not my video).  He appears just after Ariel (the airborne spirit) finishes speaking.

EDIT:  I just saw that the Stratford Theatre put out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRGwBARpPD0) as a memorial.  It also features him as Prospero.   And there's [another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf7hD6IW8l8) as well. 

"Leave not a rack behind.  We are such stuff

As dreams are made on, and our little life

Is rounded with a sleep."

(Damn, is someone cutting up onions in here...?)
    When I saw Knives Out, I knew there was something familiar about him, and I couldn't place it. Now I know, thank you.
    I also saw him at stratford! He was amazing in The Tempest. Always a very powerful character, no matter the role it always seemed natural. Also saw him during his one-man show talking about books in his life. It's where I got to put "'sex is a matter of lighting' - Christopher Plummer" in my quote book
        I'm envious you got to see his one-man show -- I missed that one!  I bet it was awesome.
We have felt the whisper of a word....
    Give me your map and I shall show you where its echo can be found.
        *Points to your heart*
    I saw this post on my phone while I was waiting for skyrim to load between two cells as I was on my way to learn another word of a shout Arngeir had found. Seeing this post made me feel all sorts of sad :(
‚ÄúSky guard you‚Äù
I saw this on the news but didn‚Äôt realize he was on Skyrim.
And Captain Vonn Trapp!
    And General Chang.
        And Prospero!
            Burns
            And Rudyard Kipling
        And my axe!
            That's one hell of an axe.
        TaH pagh, taHbe!
        You haven't experienced Skyrim until you've played it in the original Klingon.
            Fus-Ro-maQ'dah!
I found out about this today. I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt know. RIP.
    He died today, the news just broke out.
    Same here don't feel too bad :)
    You can't believe you didn't know something that happened today?
        I can‚Äôt believe he voiced Arngeir
            Ooh gotcha
"True mastery of the Voice can only be achieved when your inner spirit is in harmony with your outward actions. In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain, and the practice of the Voice, we strive to achieve this balance."

RIP to a true legend
Wind guide you
    Sky guard you.
It‚Äôs sad to see my voice teacher pass away may you R.I.P you did well teaching millions of Dovahkiins‚Äôs the way of the voice
‚ÄúWe can show you the way, but not the destination‚Äù
First Esbern and then Arngeir. Both within a year. 

RIP
He‚Äôs in Sovngarde now. May we meet again one day.
Found out he was also the Voice of Charlez Muntz from the movie Up.

Take a look at his filmography the man with a list like that it'd be odd to not have seen any of his works.
I only started playing Skyrim last year. However, as a major lover of musicals, I recognized Christopher Plummer‚Äôs voice immediately.

Just fired up the game. I‚Äôm going to run the steps, with my favorite dagger out, and leave some white flowers in the chest in honor of Plummer. üñ§
RIP Arngeir Plummer.
Dang, I loved that guy's voice in everything he did!
Definitely making a pilgrimage to high hrothgar to pay my respects
    I think we all Skyrim players should to that...
Or we all are doing it already. Truth is, I'm actually on the quest where they call you for the first time. I'm gonna do that quest right now, though it wasn't my priority.
        "Sky above, voice within"
Nok, lok-zeymah. Ven aak hi. Siiv drem ahst Sovngarde. 

Sky above, Voice within.
And he was excellent as General Chang.
may he rest eternally in the plains of sovngarde in drem
He taught most of us The Way of The Voice, rest in Sovngarde brother
Arngeir has passed into Sovngarde. May he find joy drinking mead with Jurgen Windcaller in the Hall of Valor.
Wind, guide you Plummer.

From now on, I will not kill Paarthurnax.
    I second this. As a tribute to Plummer, I will never slay the great dragon as he requested, and call on my Skyrim brethren, Imperial and Stormcloaks alike, to do the same. 

Bless my homeland forever...
Holy shit, I had no idea it was Christopher Plummer who voiced Arngeir. 

RIP.
the throat of the world is in mourning. We lost a teacher but his learning will never be forgotten
Like the Greybeards, I am now speechless.
What a legacy. 
When we replay Skyrim, it won‚Äôt be the same. We‚Äôll be listening to a ghost.
I've just restarted a new playthrough this week for the first time in years. Arngeir taught me the Way of the Voice today. RIP.
After all these years of hearing his grunts as i leveled up my sneak he will be greatly missed. RIP legend
I have listened to this guy talk god knows how many hours through who knows how many playthroughs and had no idea it was him. What a legend.
Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau.

Long in sorrow has waited the Stormcrown, with no worthy head to rest on.

May you be ready for whatever lies ahead.
may his thu‚Äôum echo throughout sovngarde
Parthanax has lost a friend.
May he feast next to Shor in Sovngarde. RIP
He's with alduin now ‚ù§Ô∏è
    Hope not
        He's with Paarthurnax now /s
            Delphine pls no
            NO! DELPHINE!
Both him and Max Von Sydow who played Eastern üòî it might sound silly but I really only knew who they were once the game was announced, I think I must've been 12 or 13. After that I started to care a lot for them and have grown to adore their body of work as I've gotten more and more into film. 

Both of their voices were so impactful for the characters they portrayed. Esbern's dream will forever stay with me
Talos guide you Chris Plummer
Just when you think the year‚Äôs reached peak shittiness it keeps getting lower.
    Hey, don't get down. We're in 2021 now and it's only February - the peak is yet to come!

Sovngarde awaits... ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Brian Jacques, Tom Clancy, Christopher Lee, Rick May, Kumiko Okae, Sean Connery, Christopher Plummer.... goodness, we're getting old....
    Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen are getting old too...
Wind guide you.
Rest in Sovngarde legend :(
Obi Wan Sky-robey
    Use your Voice, Dovahkiin.
May we meet again in sovngarde, brother.
"We are honored to welcome a Dragonborn to High Hrothgar. We will do our¬†best¬†to teach you how to use your gift in fulfillment of your destiny." - You taught us how to use our voice to offer prayer to the Divine but now we hope that through your teaching that you have reached the most happy and best afterlife for someone of your heart. üòî
Rest in peace may Talos be with you sir
Sky above, voice within..
Sad news
I forgot he was Arngeir!  May he Rest In Peace in the great hall of Sovngarde with a mug of mead for all eternity!
"Let the winds guide you."
Holy shit, he taught me so much.  Skyrim was my childhood, it was the first thing that bonded me and my older brother.  It‚Äôs a fucking terrible we had to lose him, been playing this game for so many years and no matter how many mods I have he‚Äôs still my favourite character.
FUS
    RO
        DAH
            This made me think.... if three people each said a word out of a shout, would it complete the shout?
It's fine, now he can be with Kyne, RIP
Damn I just spoke with Arngeir yesterday. From now on I will farm sneak on Borri or Wulfgar I guess. RIP
Shit, Christopher Plummer died? Also... Christopher Plummer was in Skyrim?? Time to go through his imdb to see what else I didn't know he was in.
He‚Äôs guaranteed a place in the hall of valor in Soverngarde.
Sky above, voice within.
See you in sovngarde brother
Omg! That's amazing THAT is the voice! Holy cow... He most certainly left a beautiful mark on my world
Sovngarde awaits for a hero
‚ÄúSky above, Voice within.‚Äù Rest In Peace Christopher Plummer.
I remember days when the Thu'um of the Greybeards startled me as a young lad in Whiterun. Now the coming days may be quiet but the Thu'um shall live on lest it fall on deaf ears.
Rest in peace. Thank you for the memories and the Voice
RIP Sir.. <3
RIP - one of my all time favourite actors.  Always loved introducing people to his work.  Watch Michael Mann's The Insider for peak Plummer.
I would just like to thank him for the years of training in shouts
To The Hall of Valor
Aw shoot this is how I find out about his death. Rip Arngier may you soar above the clouds of High Hrothgar into Soverngard.
Su‚Äôum ahrk morah.
Phenomenal actor.  Great run.  Rest In Peace.
Wait wait what. No
F
I'm going to play skyrim vr and visit him
I usually skip his dialogues because I've heard them a thousand times now. But I don't think I will anymore, I'd feel bad =x
Wow! I also didn‚Äôt realize this was him. So crazy. Also a lesser know part played by him was as the key antagonist, a Klingon commander in Star Trek VI the undiscovered country.
Now we stand, here on top of the world. Laying to rest one of the greatest of our time, a man with a voice that forever echos through the world and shor‚Äôs hall.  Sleep now at High Hrothgar our friend and know your work will live on.
This makes me so sad. Thanks for being part of my childhood, Christopher. Rest In Peace! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Await me in Sovngarde, brother.
This is sad, RIP Christopher. Like many of said here, I‚Äôve spent many an hour listening to this guy.
On his way to Sovngarde to square up with Esbern and settle things like true Nords.
Protector of mario
This is a good tine to sing [this song](https://youtu.be/0FLQ4rACE-0) IMO. It's an oddly fitting song. RIP to him and may we see him in Sovngarde.
    Fuck. I have to playthrough Skyrim again now.
Also the Von trapp father
Made me sad, made me frown
RIP thanks for the memories
Now, Dovahkin, let us have a taste of that sexy voice!
Voice definitely matches the face.
I had a conversation with Arngeir a little while ago. My umpteenth playthrough. I had now idea until now. RIP
Damn. And less than a year after we lost Max von Sydow (Esbern).
Dang..i just met him for the first time yesterday(in game)
Had to Google if this was true since I didn't see this on any other subreddits yet. Rest in peace
Wow, he did a ton of great voiceover work, looking at IMDB.  Great talent.
Looks like they modeled arngeir after him as well
Oh no. I always thought he did an amazing job of emoting some pretty far-out dialogue in Skyrim.
His legacy...changes lives.
Immortalized in one of the best video games ever made... pretty cool if think about it
General Chang: To be, or not to be....
May songs of your wisdom be sung in the mead halls of sovngaurd
He forgot to drink his potion of regeneration
Sky Guard You, Christopher. His rendition of Edelweiss in The Sound of Music always moved me.
"You have tasted the Voice of the Greybeards, and passed through unscathed. High Hrothgar is open to you." 

RIP Christopher Plummer may Shor accept you into his hallowed halls
Damn...

We lost Arngeir *and* Esbern?! Nirn sucks now.
*the song "Mad World" intensifies*
I never got to apologize for killing paarthurnax. Look, I promise In my 70 later ones I fixed my mistake.
May he find the warm welcome of his ancestors in Sovnegarde.
A voice i'll never be able to unhear. Rest in peace, thank you for teaching us the way of the voice.
A legendary man leaves behind a legendary legacy.
Wow this is so upsetting. This game was such a big part of my childhood. RIP :(
RIP Mr Plummer and thank you.
That's sad..
Fus Ro Gone.....  god speed.  We‚Äôll miss you, good sir.
Rest in sovngarde
Sky above, voice within..

    Gonna need that mod name.
When did he pass
    Within 24 of the reddit post
        That's sucks, we been losing alot of good people this year
**F in the chat..** ***RIP*** Christopher Plummer.

We're all going to die before Bethesda gets off their asses, and stops using Zenimax to milk people for money with ESO, and finally decides to work on and release their "Crown Jewel" Elder Scrolls VI, that's been sitting on the back burner and will probably be delayed 15 fucking years after the last game released.
Press F to Pay Respects
    F
Damn I believe he is also the voice of Esbern
    Close Esbern was voiced by Max von Sydow.
        Who also sadly passed away at 90 last year.
            Very similar voices and both were excellent actors.
                Not that similar IMO, but they're easily confused in a game where you grow accustomed to hearing the same VAs over and over. 

But Esbern, Delphine, Paarthunax and Arngeir had exclusive Big name actors.
                    10 years later it still boggles my mind that the VA for Paarthurnax is the VA for Mario.
                        Martinet is a gift to this world, his range is so awesome he can play Mario and Luigi and a bigass deep voiced Dragon.
Corporate needs you to find the difference between these two pictures
    They‚Äôre the same picture....
Edelweiss, Edelweiss, every morning you greet me. 
RIP to a great man.
May he Rest In Peace knowing how much we all appreciate his contributions to the elder scrolls franchise
He would have made a great Magneto, either him or Max Von Sydow (Esbern). Alas...

R.i.p bloody legend
Rip
RIP BOSS
Loved the voices in Skyrim. Sad man :'( RIP.
I knew i knew who that was!

Damn. Rest In Peace Christopher ‚ù§Ô∏è
Aw what really? Damm
Is he the pic on the right or the left?
R.I.P Stay within the way of the voice.
Umm excuse me...Captain Von Trapp
Is he the ‚Äúthere are always people like you‚Äù guy from the first avengers?
Oh dear, I didn't know that face was Christopher's.  He has many many prominent roles
That's strange, because when I saw he'd died I thought he looks like Max Von Sydow, who is also in skyrim.
We just lost a legend. RIP
i didnt know that. He was such a legend
RIP. I will remember his teachings
Was confused about use of "toe" here.
I had no idea he was in my favorite game. And a legendary character at that!
And now I care about this guys death....
Wind guide him
What really?
That‚Äôs sad
The voice of? I did not know that. :-(
Wasn‚Äôt he also Esbern?
    No.  That was Max Von Sydow.   Another ledgebox.
Rest in Peace.
He was a brilliant actor. RIP Mr Plummer, you will be missed. üò•
I never knew that!! Thanks kind stranger!
This sucks. I feel bad for raising my sneak skill now. RIP, my thoughts go out to his family. Sovngarde awaits old friend.
Rest in piece you great man
Dang... RIP he will live on forever in the game
I'm heading to high hrothgar for awhile
He looks exactly like I would imagine him in real life. RIP.
From both my favourite movie and game
WHAT CAPTAIN VON TRAPP IS AEGIR ALL THIS TIME. WTF some one make Aegir sing Edelweiss
RIP to a true OG with great voice acting skills
His voice will live on in the PS8 version of Skyrim.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
‚ÄúThe death of Plummermax is beyond my power to forgive.‚Äù
[removed]
I think I will stop shouting him from the mountain
these comments are making me ugly cry stop
Best Klingon ever.
May he rest in sovengarde
damn. the memories. i remember the xbox 360 years when my brother let me play skyrim, i had a blast and still play today R.I.P Dude. Hope your doing good up there. thanks for the countless years of memories.
When I was a young boy in the time of VHS my favourite film was Escape to Victory strarring  Max von Sydow and my sister's The Sound of Music starring Christopher Plummer. This caused some fights during the summer holidays. Both have left us in the last year. RIP gentlemen.
RIP

Loved him in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
He will be missed
I feel bad for ghosting him for so long
Always was a nice voice
NOOOOOO
goddamn so thats why arngeir sounded familiar
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS
F
His soul is now with wuutharth and one eyed olaf
damn man...that sucks..
Damn, day just keeps getting worse
Holy shit I‚Äôve played this game a million times and never made that connection
*cries*
Rest in Peace Master! üôè May the world be light for you!
F
Arngeir even looks like him. RIP, what an iconic voice.
Oh shit, I did not know this
What happened to him?
I knew him from Waterloo.Now I am suprised and sad because I learned this trivia in that way.
Born in the same year than Max von Sydow (Esbern, and, well, equally huge career) and died within a year of his death.
The Talos scream at the end gets me lmao
F
F
So now the voice actors for both Esbern and Arngeir have died? Wow.
RIP
RIP, you will be missed... but never forgotten.
Damn he was the main Greybeard? üò≠ I'm playing right now smh r.i.p.
‚ÄúSovngarde awaits.‚Äù
Woah what. Not to be rude or anything, rip. But I swear I saw an article saying he died last year or something...thats wild
 Shor bless you
Ah I didn‚Äôt know this. The only memorable movie I saw with Mr. Plummer in it was the Sound of Music. I can‚Äôt watch the scene where he sings Edelweiss to the crowd with shedding a manly tear. 
General Tullius however I immediately recognized as my favorite XO Saul Tigh, and that‚Äôs why I always side with the Imperials. I can‚Äôt kill my 2nd favorite Galactica character.
This was a sad thing to hear :(
Rest in peace, Christopher Plummer. He was an amazing actor.
He made me choose Paarthurnax to live. 

Now, that dragon and I were pals.
That's my guy nepos the nose.
I did not know that!
Nooo dude I was just speaking to him the last time I played the other night! I am grateful to listen to his voice while he was still sharing this world with me rip to such a moving man.
Rest in Peace, we will meet again in Sovngarde, old friend
F

May he drink mead among the great heroes of Sovngarde
Brilliant job bringing the Greybeards to life. He was literally their voice as the others refuse to talk. 

RIP.
Legend! RIP!
F
Rip
He's in Sovngarde now :(
Rest in peace
he also tried to frame Captain Kirk for killing Chancellor Gorkon  edit: before anyone flips out on me that's my way of saying he was in Star Trek VI
F
Another legendary soul to walk the whale-bone bridge and take his rightful seat in the Hall of Valor.
F
RIP :(
He was Arngeir? Wow.
Talos guide you in your trip to sovngarde brother.
I can almost hear Sovngarde BGM playing now
First Esbern now Angier, who's next parthurnax
Lok Bo, Thuum tuum.
I never got to apologize for abusing him to level up my one and two handed skills in stealthüòû
Thank you for teaching me how to master my gift. I will always follow your wisdom and will slay Delphine every playthrough in your honor.
May the wind guide his soul.
Damn? Was it from natural causes?
Press F to pay respects!
That‚Äôs so upsetting.
This man made my childhood, how many times I have done this quest :(
I was just watching The Sound of Music last weekend and wondered what Julie Andrews's counterpart was doing these days. I think I must have jinxed him.
I was only looking at the voices behind Skyrim videos yesterday! üò±
your shouts made my axe lighter. heil!
May wind guide you
noo dam
NOOOOOOO
Pictures you can hear.
What the fuck?  
Yesterday it was Zenimax's CEO, and now this? Who's next, Todd Howard?
Hes literally the same dude
Oh damn I just know him from the sound of music, didn't know he did the voice for arngeir too.
Wind guide you...
R.I.P
Till we meet again, in sovngarde
He will live on in the greatest game of all time.
RIP general chang
First the lady who voiced Treetrunks in Adventure Time passes, then the guy who made Dragon Tales or whatever that PBS show was, and now this? What a shitty month
I really whant to have an easter egg of him in the elder scroll 6
RIP
Damn. I was literally just watching a video about his performance in Skyrim. Sad, man. RIP.
I am officially never siding with the Blades again.
May the All-Maker bless ye
Come gather 'round all ye bastards, and raise up a cup to this arse-turd. He came and freed the fires of hell and let 'em run loose over hill and dell.
Heres to Arngeir and his knob of head, heres to the dragon the smoke and the dead. The gate is knocked in and the town is aflame and it's our's for the taking but he's got the fame.

We tortured some townsfolk it's true. And pounded but couldn't break through. With all his might a dragon took flight and burned the town down to a ball-bag of shite. Heres to Arngeir and his scab of a brain, heres to the dragon and all it has slain. The gate is knocked in and the town is aflame and it's our's for the taking but he's got the fame.

Heres to Arngeir and a pullin-me-plum, heres to the beast and the rest of you scum. The gate is knocked in and the town is aflame and it's our's for the taking though he's got the fame.

Sk√•l
There is only silence right now. Perhaps later we will hear one of the lost Words.
Bless him
Oh... I hope he had a happy life
May the wind guide you, and the sky guard you.

Krosis
Literally best voice work for the game outside paarthunax and the rest of the dragons. The game itself was magical but I saw sooo much passion go into those first few missions, climbing up the 7,000 steps, speaking and training with the Graybeards, and finally meeting Paarthunax. What a magical experience. Rest In Peace, you wonderful man.
Talking to the grey beards has always been a favorite little tidbit of the game for me, thank you Christopher for enriching our lives with your part in our beloved game. He's drinking exceptional mead in Sovngarde now, rest easy old timer.
You know, I don't think I've ever seen Arngeir on lists of Most Annoying/Stupidest NPCs in Skyrim. Props to you, Christopher Plummer!
I'll be waiting for you in sovngarde master Arngeir
Your teachings will always be with us.. Sky above, voice with in
Rest well old friend. We will meet again in Sovngarde.
Damn it! I knew it!
I've always played Skyrim in Spanish, but when that guy died and I saw his face I was thinking "I swear this guy was related to Skyrim?" I thought of Paarthurnax... but it was Arngeir.

Also, last year died Max Von Sydow, Esbern's voice and the Three Eyed Raven in GoT.

They lived a long life, and I'm sure they spent their last days in peace, but it still hurts... even though I never knew them in person...

They seemed like nice people. Rest in peace, master. Jurgen Wind-Caller may guide you!
Also the Polish actor who dubbed Arngeir died too...
To be honest, I just started playing Skyrim just yesterday again.. I just went through quest "The Way of the Voice".. Rest in peace  **Arngeir.** We'll meet again.
R.I.P.
Breath and focus üòî

He's with Jurgen Windcaller now.
Wow! They really made his character look like him!

Today, I put reddit on Top, All Time. After scrolling a bit I saw this. Never knew it happened. I just started a new Skyrim game and I will do the main questline just to see Arngeir more
We shall find our way to Sovngarde together brother. We shall toast our mugs of mead and sing songs worthy of Shor's favor and Kynareth's tears.
I‚Äôd like to think Patrick Stewart could play him in a live action role
Damn that‚Äôs sad
We need show respect to the great voice. 

Mkhm...did anybody happen to Soul Trap him before he went to Sovengarde?
Sky above, voice within.
I can still hear his voice. Rest in peace üôè
We raise our mugs in your honor

*kneels at his Tombstone.*
    Went from sad to Sad ultra instinct
        Heh, thanks.
Valhalla! oops I mean let's meet again in Sovngarde
I‚Äôm about to buy a strong whiskey tomorrow to celebrate his life
"Sky guard you. Wind guide you. "
    Wind Guide You is also a great song from the soundtrack
        Every song is also a great song from the soundtrack
            He speak da true-true
Arngeir? I didn‚Äôt know that was him. Damn.
    I remember watching the credits for Skyrim after beating the MQ the first time, looking him up, some of his other work, then not being able to unhear it.
        I haven‚Äôt watch many movies as I have been working two jobs a majority of my adult life, so I haven‚Äôt seen many films. I would rather spend my time playing video games. Especially with Plummet in it. I had time off with the family and watched Knives Out, which I thought he was excellent in. I didn‚Äôt connect the two voices at all. 

When Max Von Sydow passed I knew it was him as his voice is distinct. I instantly knew he voiced Esbern after watching Game of Thrones. (The first role I seen of him, and of course The Force Awakens)

Definitely sad when someone who I spent several hours (hundreds lol) hearing is gone. At least he had a long, and successful career.
            >	The first role I seen of him, and of course The Force Awakens

Evidently I'm getting old, he'll always be the Exorcist to me. Although his character in Minority Report is also great.
                Damn. I need to see that movie.
                    Also if you haven't, watch Seventh Seal.  A totally transcendent film experience.  Absolutely an all time great.
            You owe it to yourself to check out Max von Sydow's body of work beyond more recent stuff. Some quality stuff in there if you're slightly film buff'y.
            Yep. Did you mean sydow, not snow?
                Fixed
        There are credits after the main quest? I never saw that
            There's a main quest after oh hey what's that over there...
                Lol, that's exactly the reason why I never finshed the main quest line in my 500 hours of playing skyrim.
                    Took me literally over two years, but the main quest is worth playing.
                        Is the main quest Alduin or the civil war bro?
                            Alduin.
            You access them in settings, I think. I just didn't watch them until I finished the main story
    [deleted]
His legacy truly lives on.
    He's immortal.
I was gonna say "Breath and focus." 

I'm sad about his passing. Ive played so much Skyrim that he was like a proxy grandpa to me. I always keep "Breath and focus" in the back of my mind, just to remind myself.
    Lowkey been thinking of getting a breath and focus tattoo in the dragon language
    It's not a particularly unique line, I've heard it countless times both in real life and in other media, but for some reason it's my favorite version and like you it stuck in my mind. Maybe it's the short and concise phrasing, or the cadence.
        It's very buddhist sounding to me, and, of all the weird mantras people have to keep themselves sane, this one seems better than most. Arngeir says it all the time, but when he talks to you after your final boss battle with Alduin Christopher Plummer puts a special emphasis on the words.  Like "see? Told ya so!" But in a loving way that acknowledges how far you had come to reach that point. It's just a small vocal inflection that Plummer did that made it different from the other times Arngeir says it, but it told me everything I needed to hear. I love quality voice acting.
"Breath and focus."
"Wind, guide you."
Love that quote
I couldn‚Äôt picture who he was because it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve actually gone to the greybeards but reading that brought me back immediately
A playthrough with the bulk of his lines: https://youtu.be/wrP_q8LUZcU?t=68
Finna make us cry bro???
he leveled up my sneak
    ...how?
        make difficulty legendary, go behind him, sneak, take off all armour and hit. keep hitting. stop when he turns back or you get detected.
            Holy fuck i had no idea putting the difficulty to legendary made you level up faster, that would've saved me so much time
                Well, kinda. You can‚Äôt sneak attack downed npcs. (downed in this case meaning essential npcs who have lost all of their health). And since sneak attacks do multiplied damage, it is easy to down Arengir on a lower difficulty. Setting the game to legendary decreases the amount of damage you do, allowing you to perform more sneak attacks. So while, yes, setting your game to legendary makes levelling your sneak more efficient (as well as other combat related trees, since you have to attack a lot more often and get hit harder), setting your game to legendary does not affect the overall speed of levelling directly.
        Legendary difficulty, keep stabbing him with a dagger when he is sitting down
            "Of all the people that could have been the chosen one, it had to be this fucking guy." Arngeir, probably.
Literally never made this connection either. Insane how much impact this man‚Äôs voice has had on our adventures.
Someone copied this exact comment and posted it. Lmao; but rip Arngeir
    *dies*
I hope Bethesda gives his character a nice ‚Äúshout out‚Äù in the next game, it would be a nice way to honor him. Like in the history of Alduin‚Äôs Return, mention how he helped the DB by training them and talk about his dedication to his cause.
Dude, you've got to cut your onions somewhere else.

I know he kind of hated the role, but his role in the Sound of Music is something I (and countless others) hold near and dear. Edelweiss is a song I think of when I need comfort. His voice to me sounds like an old friend, a loved one.

Can't believe he's gone. 91 is pretty old and I know he lived a full and accomplished life, but it still feels like it was too soon.
I like that song, it seems weirdly applicable for this...
Oh, fuck.  Now I'm crying.
This really is a good incentive to finally make something with that Edelweiss knitting pattern I have and some silver-gray yarn
This was the comment that made me cry.
Wonderful. Good tribute.
Isn't it... strange?

Chris passed away, but we can always hear his voice again when talking to Arngeir... It's like, he'll always be alive in the game.
Same. Time to climb the 7000 steps.
I watched him in Knives out just last week, it may not be the deepest or most contrived of mystery dramas but it was amazingly entertaining (those 2+ hours felt like 40 min) and Plummer was a big part of that, his few scenes and his chemistry with Ana de Armas were part of what made that movie so great.
    Totally agreed, it's such a clever script, and all the actors were obviously having a blast!  (Especially Chris Evans playing an asshole instead of the good guy, lol!)
        Chris Evans is way better as a bad guy than as a hero. He‚Äôs amazing in Scott Pilgrim too.
            I think he's good at both, but he seems to enjoy playing a villain more.  That said, most actors do!
Let's not forget "The Sound of Music"
    *The hills are aliiiiive....with the thu'um of dragons!*
        *... with songs they have sung for YOL TOOR SHUL!*

Well now you said that, I'mma need a Sound of Music set in Skyrim homage.

DISNEY, GET YER FINGERS OUT!
    "You flatter me Captain."

"Oh how clumsy of me; I meant to accuse you."

Badass line
    I might have to watch that on Disney+ tonight before watching National Treasure where he played the grandpa
Tried to figure out why i knew him, and yet it was knives out. Great film and performance from him.

    Good bot
I just watched sound of music a couple nights ago rip, also your from the Stratford area? Sweet I‚Äôm not too far from Stratford
    Sort of, I was living in Waterloo at the time so it was a short drive away for me, but since then we've moved to Montreal.   I do miss being able to go to Stratford and watch a play whenever I wanted (not that I could do it now anyway, in these Covid times).  We'd drive the scenic route along the backcountry roads through St. Agatha and the like.  I also tried to see the springtime swan parade in Stratford every year, haha!  Loved that event, so much fun!
        Speaking of Waterloo he was Wellington in that film.
    /u/JimLaheySunnyvale, I have found an error in your comment:

I consider this post by you, JimLaheySunnyvale, wrong; it should read ‚Äúalso ~~your~~ [**you're**] from the Stratford‚Äù instead. ‚ÄòYour‚Äô is possessive; ‚Äòyou're‚Äô means ‚Äòyou are‚Äô.

Do you remember anything about his Prospero performance?
    It was years ago, the production was from 2010.  However, if you want to see him for yourself, [I've timestamped this video](https://youtu.be/XZRNJeZFnQ4?t=105) of the production (not my video).  He appears just after Ariel (the airborne spirit) finishes speaking.

EDIT:  I just saw that the Stratford Theatre put out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRGwBARpPD0) as a memorial.  It also features him as Prospero.   And there's [another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf7hD6IW8l8) as well.

(Damn, is someone cutting up onions in here...?)
When I saw Knives Out, I knew there was something familiar about him, and I couldn't place it. Now I know, thank you.
I also saw him at stratford! He was amazing in The Tempest. Always a very powerful character, no matter the role it always seemed natural. Also saw him during his one-man show talking about books in his life. It's where I got to put "'sex is a matter of lighting' - Christopher Plummer" in my quote book
    I'm envious you got to see his one-man show -- I missed that one!  I bet it was awesome.
Give me your map and I shall show you where its echo can be found.
    *Points to your heart*
I saw this post on my phone while I was waiting for skyrim to load between two cells as I was on my way to learn another word of a shout Arngeir had found. Seeing this post made me feel all sorts of sad :(
And General Chang.
    And Prospero!

        And Rudyard Kipling
    And my axe!
        That's one hell of an axe.

    You haven't experienced Skyrim until you've played it in the original Klingon.
        Fus-Ro-maQ'dah!
He died today, the news just broke out.
Same here don't feel too bad :)
You can't believe you didn't know something that happened today?
    I can‚Äôt believe he voiced Arngeir
        Ooh gotcha
Sky guard you.
I think we all Skyrim players should to that...
Or we all are doing it already. Truth is, I'm actually on the quest where they call you for the first time. I'm gonna do that quest right now, though it wasn't my priority.
    "Sky above, voice within"
I second this. As a tribute to Plummer, I will never slay the great dragon as he requested, and call on my Skyrim brethren, Imperial and Stormcloaks alike, to do the same. 

Bless my homeland forever...
Hope not
    He's with Paarthurnax now /s

Close Esbern was voiced by Max von Sydow.
    Who also sadly passed away at 90 last year.
        Very similar voices and both were excellent actors.
            Not that similar IMO, but they're easily confused in a game where you grow accustomed to hearing the same VAs over and over. 

But Esbern, Delphine, Paarthunax and Arngeir had exclusive Big name actors.
                10 years later it still boggles my mind that the VA for Paarthurnax is the VA for Mario.
                    Martinet is a gift to this world, his range is so awesome he can play Mario and Luigi and a bigass deep voiced Dragon.
They‚Äôre the same picture....

When Max Von Sydow passed I knew it was him as his voice is distinct. I instantly knew he voiced Esbern after watching Game of Thrones. (The first role I seen of him, and of course The Force Awakens)

Definitely sad when someone who I spent several hours (hundreds lol) hearing is gone. At least he had a long, and successful career.

Evidently I'm getting old, he'll always be the Exorcist to me. Although his character in Minority Report is also great.
            Damn. I need to see that movie.
                Also if you haven't, watch Seventh Seal.  A totally transcendent film experience.  Absolutely an all time great.
        You owe it to yourself to check out Max von Sydow's body of work beyond more recent stuff. Some quality stuff in there if you're slightly film buff'y.
        Yep. Did you mean sydow, not snow?
            Fixed
    There are credits after the main quest? I never saw that
        There's a main quest after oh hey what's that over there...
            Lol, that's exactly the reason why I never finshed the main quest line in my 500 hours of playing skyrim.
                Took me literally over two years, but the main quest is worth playing.
                    Is the main quest Alduin or the civil war bro?
                        Alduin.
        You access them in settings, I think. I just didn't watch them until I finished the main story

He's immortal.
Lowkey been thinking of getting a breath and focus tattoo in the dragon language
It's not a particularly unique line, I've heard it countless times both in real life and in other media, but for some reason it's my favorite version and like you it stuck in my mind. Maybe it's the short and concise phrasing, or the cadence.
    It's very buddhist sounding to me, and, of all the weird mantras people have to keep themselves sane, this one seems better than most. Arngeir says it all the time, but when he talks to you after your final boss battle with Alduin Christopher Plummer puts a special emphasis on the words.  Like "see? Told ya so!" But in a loving way that acknowledges how far you had come to reach that point. It's just a small vocal inflection that Plummer did that made it different from the other times Arngeir says it, but it told me everything I needed to hear. I love quality voice acting.
...how?
    make difficulty legendary, go behind him, sneak, take off all armour and hit. keep hitting. stop when he turns back or you get detected.
        Holy fuck i had no idea putting the difficulty to legendary made you level up faster, that would've saved me so much time
            Well, kinda. You can‚Äôt sneak attack downed npcs. (downed in this case meaning essential npcs who have lost all of their health). And since sneak attacks do multiplied damage, it is easy to down Arengir on a lower difficulty. Setting the game to legendary decreases the amount of damage you do, allowing you to perform more sneak attacks. So while, yes, setting your game to legendary makes levelling your sneak more efficient (as well as other combat related trees, since you have to attack a lot more often and get hit harder), setting your game to legendary does not affect the overall speed of levelling directly.
    Legendary difficulty, keep stabbing him with a dagger when he is sitting down
        "Of all the people that could have been the chosen one, it had to be this fucking guy." Arngeir, probably.
*dies*
Totally agreed, it's such a clever script, and all the actors were obviously having a blast!  (Especially Chris Evans playing an asshole instead of the good guy, lol!)
    Chris Evans is way better as a bad guy than as a hero. He‚Äôs amazing in Scott Pilgrim too.
        I think he's good at both, but he seems to enjoy playing a villain more.  That said, most actors do!

I might have to watch that on Disney+ tonight before watching National Treasure where he played the grandpa
Good bot
Sort of, I was living in Waterloo at the time so it was a short drive away for me, but since then we've moved to Montreal.   I do miss being able to go to Stratford and watch a play whenever I wanted (not that I could do it now anyway, in these Covid times).  We'd drive the scenic route along the backcountry roads through St. Agatha and the like.  I also tried to see the springtime swan parade in Stratford every year, haha!  Loved that event, so much fun!
    Speaking of Waterloo he was Wellington in that film.
/u/JimLaheySunnyvale, I have found an error in your comment:

 > ‚Äúalso ~~your~~ [**you're**] from the Stratford‚Äù

I consider this post by you, JimLaheySunnyvale, wrong; it should read ‚Äúalso ~~your~~ [**you're**] from the Stratford‚Äù instead. ‚ÄòYour‚Äô is possessive; ‚Äòyou're‚Äô means ‚Äòyou are‚Äô.

It was years ago, the production was from 2010.  However, if you want to see him for yourself, [I've timestamped this video](https://youtu.be/XZRNJeZFnQ4?t=105) of the production (not my video).  He appears just after Ariel (the airborne spirit) finishes speaking.

EDIT:  I just saw that the Stratford Theatre put out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRGwBARpPD0) as a memorial.  It also features him as Prospero.   And there's [another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf7hD6IW8l8) as well.

You haven't experienced Skyrim until you've played it in the original Klingon.
    Fus-Ro-maQ'dah!
I can‚Äôt believe he voiced Arngeir
    Ooh gotcha

He's with Paarthurnax now /s

That's sucks, we been losing alot of good people this year

Who also sadly passed away at 90 last year.
    Very similar voices and both were excellent actors.
        Not that similar IMO, but they're easily confused in a game where you grow accustomed to hearing the same VAs over and over. 

But Esbern, Delphine, Paarthunax and Arngeir had exclusive Big name actors.
            10 years later it still boggles my mind that the VA for Paarthurnax is the VA for Mario.
                Martinet is a gift to this world, his range is so awesome he can play Mario and Luigi and a bigass deep voiced Dragon.
He didn't know who he was. Why is he a prick?
Oh, so if you think I was joking a month ago when my grandma died I wouldn‚Äôt joke when died the person I don‚Äôt know personally? Everyone have their own after-shock  defensive strategies, so if you don‚Äôt like how someone react on someone‚Äôs death... just scroll a little and let me handle my feelings myself...
Indeed brother.
Heh, thanks.
Every song is also a great song from the soundtrack
