[[Just Palworld things]]





Just be careful that you don‚Äôt Catch Them All from entry number 69.
    Noice.
        Noice.
            Noice.
                Noice.
    Yeah man, like save some of that for the rest of us. There's plenty to go around. Sharing is Caring.
        Wonder if any of the Pals can make the penicillin that some of you are gonna need?
            I'd be more interested in the diabetes cure from all that cotton candy for the factory workers
            Luckily enough, lovander's level 2 in medicine production. Also, unrelated, but it has level 2 in handiwork and drops suspicious juice, so take that as you will.
            I mean, making medicine is a skill isn't it?

so probably?
        Imagine a true Rimworld/Dwarf Fortress experience where Pal number 69 may have a chance to give you an STD.
    Gotta fuck‚Äôem all
        bro   be carefull or u will become a furry
            Speaking from experience, I see


Edit: no judging tho :3
            What a horrible tragedy that could be...
        Sigh........ [obligatory ](https://youtu.be/CVqsQ-9GLLE?si=3CEMFIpbcNYd0Z5W)
    There are no rules in the palworld, batman
    And here are your new Pals

Syphilis
Gonorrhea
And Chlamydia.
There are no protective laws in the pal world batman.
    Lol, you think that until you go to the animal sanctuary or try to capture a civilian, and cops with enough firepower to blow away your entire team start appearing out of thin air. It‚Äôs pretty funny.
        Do cops actually show up at the sanctuary? I saw the constant "criminal activity" message but nothing happened no matter how many Pals I caught/killed in an attempt to catch.
            Yeah kill enough and they'll constantly spawn like 10 level 50s on you
                So what you're saying is that i can have a squad of Cops as Pals?
                    Yeah sort of but they're real annoying (along with annoying music). Will spawn on you while flying too lol
                        How in the world do you get them to stop pursuing? Only way I can see is to just die
                            > Only way I can see is to just die

That's what my friend and I did ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the internet said you can kill everyone and it'll stop, but they just kept spawning - it seemed impossible to down them all at once before more showed up.  We're also only levels ~15-20, so maybe that's easier as you level up.
                                Don't attack them yourself, you'll get more assault charges and it'll spawn more. Just let your pals take care of them, there might be 1 or 2 waves of respawns but they *will* stop after that. I frequent the no.1 reserve because I'm really trying to get a 4-star Petalia
                    They dont fire their weapons after becoming pals. They just do melee attacks. Disappointing.
                        You can teach them other moves
                            Did they fix the glitch where they won‚Äôt use those moves, or do they actually work now?
            If one of the guards sees you attacking one of the creatures, you get an alert sound that sounds an awful lot like the, "you committed a crime!" alert sound from Cyberpunk 2077, then a "Wanted!" box shows up in the top right corner, and then the guards start attacking you.
                Huh, there wasn't any cops there when I was. Guess I have to go commit crime again to see if they were just on break.
                    From what I've seen

As you start capturing and knocking out pals in the reservation. Guards start taking up those slots more often than pals do.

A reservation will start with like 2 guards and will eventually have 20+ and no more pals.

 Getting spotted means certain death, but the rare pals are worth it.
                        >Getting spotted means certain death, but the rare pals are worth it.

This has so much "African rhino poacher vs hardcore rangers" energy, it's making me ponder some major worldbuilding connotations for Palworld.
                        Does it reset the # of guards after you die or something?
                            When you get far away enough everything de-spawns and will spawn back in when rendered.

So unless you have a palbox on the reserve (which I haven't tried) everything should repopulate normally.

I've had problems losing lucky pals by getting too far away from them. Once they un-render, pals don't seem to stay.
                        Question: can you capture the Guards? Haven't started playing yet, but this sounds like a great way to get a lot of human pals if so...
            I've only crimed once, but it was kinda like GTA stars.  A single assault got the people nearby mad at me.  Once I hit 3, it started spawning level 24s.  At 5 assaults, they were level 30, and at 10 or so I was seeing level 50s.  They spawned in all around me (probably ~3 of them to start, up to 10ish at the peak), even after fast traveling somewhere else
            "Criminal activity" doesn't do anything by itself, but those islands spawn cops. If any cop gets line of sight on you while you have that status, you'll become a wanted criminal for trespassing.¬† And if you attack a cop while another cop can see you, you'll become wanted for assault, as well.


To be clear, "line of sight" for them is a sight cone with some maximum range.¬† You have a little wiggle room.¬† Surprisingly, you can even shoot them from out of range of their sight, and they won't "see" you for criminal purposes until you get close enough.
    Batman, I -I
I caught uh-
I caught a little Pokemon.
Do you wanna know
What Pokemon I caught?

What Pokemon did you catch, Joker?

I caught a Lopunny, Batman
I caught a Lopunny

Oh No, Joker
Don't tell me

You already know, Batman
You know what I'm gonna do
TO THAT THING!

JOKER!
It's an animal, Joker!
You can't-

BATMAN, THERE IS NO LAWS AGAINST THE POKEMON, BATMAN!
I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT WITH IT!

NO OH MY GOD! NO!

I'M GONNA DO IT, BATMAN!
        The fact the Lopunny is completely OK with this in the animation and actually seems happy/excited scares me.
            Lopunny has enough PP that it doesn‚Äôt need to struggle.
                o_o
                Angry upvote.
                There are a few ways to interpret this‚Ä¶
                And it‚Äôs about to get some more PP‚Ä¶
                Not when they have infinite stamina potions
                Holy shit the layers in this comment
            For all we know she thinks joker is just a weird Mr mime
                Mr. Mime and Lopunny are in the same egg group.
                    The only group I'd have for Mr. Mime in real life is "kill on sight".
                        That's a lot of Pok√©mon to be fair.
                        My grouping would be 5.25 inches at 50 yards.
                    Mr. Mime (Gotham Form)

Instead of saying 'Mime' or 'Mr. Mime' the Gotham form of Mr. Mime often says strange things about scars and society.
            wait. this is a thing?
                https://youtu.be/VZllAa1odpU?si=YqQnUbSFQn4ecFU4
            Probably thinks Joker is an ugly Mr. Mime.
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI3bUEXxJCk
            WTF did I just experience
                That is what is called *art.*
                Joker is somehow worse when he isn't breaking laws.

                    I‚Äôve seen this before but it reminded me of how Batman will sometimes hook up with Barbara. Like, yeah they should rethink that.
                        > Batman will sometimes hook up with Barbara

Bruce Timm has done great things for Batman, but his weird Bruce/Babs thing always drags him down a bit.
                            Who's the guy who said heros don't perform cunnilingus?
                                Iirc it was D.C. Editorial.

The Harley Quinn cartoon wanted to put in a scene of him going down on Catwoman and D.C. said ‚ÄúNo, we won‚Äôt be able to sell toys of him if he goes down on her.‚Äù
                                    I would buy a statue or action figures of Batman going down on Catwoman and I'm not even a comic fan, just a cunnilingus fan
                Oh you¬¥re in for a treat

                    what the fuck dude
                        I know. Having to go to YouTube to watch videos instead of them being allowed to be embedded? Fuck that.
                Peak
        I was kind of confused because it called out Batman, but I definitely read this in Morty's voice.
        I just watched the video but before I totally heard this in the "Caaaaarlll that kills people" cadence
        I'm washing out my grinder, batman
            NO JOKER THATS THE KIEF
    NO JOKRE DONTT DO IT!!!1!!1
        NOOOOOOOO
    Actually if you try to put a friendly NPC in a ball the feds turn up and you end up wanted like in GTA and they gun you down for kidnapping

However if you get raided, raiders are fair game
        They use US prison system rules I see
        I wonder what constitutes friendly. I caught one of the level 5 guys squatting by a campfire, and nothing seemed to happen.
        You spared their lives, they owe you.... so they get to work whatever you darn well tell them
    Is this an Aslume joke Im not aware of?
        Jonkler catches a lopunny
    I've seen a guy named OSHA_inspector going around. I don't know if he is into roleplay, but the meme alone got a laugh out of me.
I got raided by a SWARM of these damn things yesterday. It was night time so the only Pals awake were the nocturnal ones. Luckily they ran off before destroying anything. I died 4 times just trying to get back to my loot bag after they killed me the first time.
    "YOU'RE BEING RAIDED BY PALS THAT WANT TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND"

Wat.
        Actually it‚Äôs ‚Äúcrazed fan girls‚Äù. So basically the same thing.
            I honestly thought npc‚Äôs were coming. I had no idea these things existed before they tore through my camp
            Fangirls that can't contain their love for you.
                Ey there's the way-too-long-name I couldn't remember!
            The raid names seem to change a bit. Mine was "Bandwagon Fan Girls" when we first encountered them.
            I was so fucking confused when it said that. I ended up catching one though she's pretty powerful. My wife has a lot to say about it everytime she pops up on screen tho haha
                My friend caught one with multiple bonuses to work speed and all he could say was '.... sigh. She's 'very good with her hands''.
        warning  there is hot pals in your area.
        I WILL DEFEND MY VIRGINITY WITH MY LIFE.
        Whole new meaning to 'hot singles in your area'.
    I'm not gonna lie, after ready the entry, those things running to me will never stop being scary.

That huge things with massive teeth that wants to rip my arm off? No problem.

Pink Nicky Minaj Dinosaur? Hell fucking no.
        A friend called them Goofy Minaj and it seems pretty accurate.
        My personal name for pal 69 is Jar Jar Pinks
        Pink Nicky Minaj Dinosaur that'll yiff you every night if it gets ahold of you with or without your approval.

I can't think of a worse nightmare for furry-haters.
    You can sleep even in the raid btw, just sleep and take the raid on when it is morning.
        This is super helpful information. So like just goto bed as they approach?
            Yea, it will just pause the raid and resume in the morning, when your palkemon is more awake.
                Lol @ Palkemon. I'm stealing it just FYI. And thanks for the knowledge, I hadn't even thought of that.
                That's polite of them
                    Professionals have standard
                    palite
    Man got Snu Snu‚Äôd
        Psh more like gang snu snu'd.
            Even better!
    They're actually extremely useful. I've caught like 6 of them for menial chores lol¬†
    I built my base on top of this mountain next to a bunch of metal deposits, and now every time a raid shows up, they spawn at the bottom of this cliff and can't reach anything that I built. It's kinda amusing watching them run around in circles before despawning, but I do hope they give them some sort of way to get up cliffs in a future update.
    *Hot single girls in your area wanting to fuck*
Apparently, pal number 42 can stone the enemies.
    That‚Äôs number 420. Number 42 is just the answer.
        420 had better be a grass/fire type...
            Also a dog that resembles a certain Peanuts character instead of a pokemon.
                Oh, I get it. Because people smoked a loot of weed at Woodstock, right?
                    I assume it's more about Snoopy being close to Snoop, who smokes a lot of weed.  Because Woodstock is the bird, not the dog.
                        Frankly I just enjoy the fact that both connections are possible to make.
                    Fwiw, I thought your Woodstock theory worked pretty well too lol.
                Does he rap?
            350 should be a loch ness monster
                got dang it!! i ain‚Äôt giving no monster no **tree fiddy**!!
        Yes, but what's the question?
            "what do you get when you multiply six by nine?"

  
-a bunch of handmade scrabble tiles randomly chosen from a bag by a time-displaced organic component of the greatest supercomputer of all time, who happened to be revered for his supreme sandwich making abilities
                I've seen a lot of references to Hitchhikers guide but I've never seen anyone make a reference to 'Mostly Harmless' haha awesome stuff
                    The later books were actually really compelling but tend to get drowned out of the conversation by all the memorable moments in the first book made famous by the movie(s)
                Ah, I see you are also someone who really knows where their towel is.
            Violence.

It's never the answer
                clever :D but by answering that question thusly you created an instance of it becoming a literal answer, and have further contributed to the total progressive breakdown of spacetime, which I appreciate :)
                Violence is never the answer. It is the question, and the answer is yes
                the answer is always yes
        Watch pal 420 become some rock or flower based plant.
        So long and thanks for all the feeeeesh!
    Actually pal 42 was the first Pal to play in the MLB.
    There's also pals who [injure knees of people who used to be an adventurer like you](https://i.imgur.com/nlKwoJw.png).
    Pal #42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.
What more could you ask for
    More dinosaur looking pals
        Do I have the just the game for you!
            The kid named ARK: Survival
                kid named terribly unoptimized "we don't know how to use more than 1 thread" buggy 300GB mess with wasted potential:
                    "oh it's just a 20GB patch wait why is it redownloading everything!?"
                    And despite all that, it's still a pretty great game.
                        Only if you're forewarned about how awful the vanilla settings are.

Or if you don't value the commodity known as time.
            Hot New version just dropped even lol
                for ASE or ASA? I havnt touched ASA since it launched due to how desastrous both the game and the shitstorm around the company decisions were. Is it any good now?
                    ASA is better if you like the vanilla experience and graphical updates with PVE.  Some good quality of life stuff in there but its not quite where it needs to be yet and still has a ton of bugs.  ASE is probably still going to be the better route for stability and the overall mod availability.
                        Alright so basically nothing has changed yet lol
        There's a zero fucking chance we won't be digging for fossils and have revitalization chambers at some point. And then compression fossil pals for oil so we can power submarines and go collect sea fossils to keep going.
            This is a joke about Ark. Which is the game Palworld is apparently copying more than Pokemon.
                Palworld is basically someone going "What if we made Ark but good?"
                    What if we made Ark with more than 15 frames per second?
                I think Studio Wildcard has burned far too many bridges for anyone to argue in their favour lol.
                    Them dropping paid DLC/expansion during early access was the beginning of the end.
                They've definitely improved upon the game loop from Ark.  Also much, much less unreal engine jank from what I've seen.
                Or they genuinely want more dinosaur like designs in the game?
        Gamfreaks been giving dinosaur Pok√©mon the shaft for a while too.
            The shaft, you say?
                No, Joker, you can‚Äôt!
            They've been giving me the shaft by turning every cute lil cat into a god damn fursuit
        It IS an Early Acess.

I'm expecting more pals in the future. (awful name, tho. Homophone to cock in portuguese, too, it:s a riot here im Brazil)
        Idk man, a goofy looking electric Dino whooped my ass yesterday lol
    * Executing captured human Pals for what's in their pockets.  
* Butchering Pals for meat.

But both of those exist already. What is needed is to:  

* Butcher human Pals for meat.
        I thought you were supposed to use humans for hats, not meat
            r/shitrimworldsays
        I got a game for you then... head on over to /r/rimworld for all your human butchering needs.
            mmmm tasty tasty warcrimes
        I watched a video of a human pal being butchered so can you not collect the meat?
            I don't think human pals drop anything when butchered.
        Donner, party of five?
        Ah, the Conan/Rimworld crossover
Beegarde and Elizabee both have "cake" on them which is fitting since honey is required to bake the cakes in game.
    Don‚Äôt you have to feed pals cake in order for them to breed too?
        Yes. Lovander also had a chance to drop cake as well.
    They'll produce honey if you have a ranch and they work at your base.
    Don't worry, Lovander also has "cake" on her because obviously she has a lot of it to go around.
The modding scene for this game is going to be absolutely degenerate and I‚Äôm here for it
    Someone already made a mod that puts Pok√©mon skins on the pal and turns your character into ash. That‚Äôs the kinda shit that‚Äôll get the game into hot water.
        No, that'll get the mod into hot water. ESPECIALLY so b/c in order to get the mod you have to pay for it. That modder is fucked
            I believe the mod is actually taken down now.
                Hope so for his sake. Japan's lack of fair use laws means he couldn't have it anyway, but charging money for it was like throwing gasoline on campfire next to a natural gas facility.
                    If an American or Canadian developer makes a mod that violates Japanese laws what legal recourse is there for the Japanese company seeking damages? Could they sue internationally or something?
                        Yes, and from what I hear they are pretty successful in those lawsuits. Nintendos litigation arm is world wide and successful from everything I've read recently. The fact Pocketpair is in Japan and not pursuing this means they probably won't in the future. 

I'm not sure if they go after every Tom Dick or Harry but others have already said that the modder got a Cease and Desist letter.
    Who needs mods when the basegame already looks like a junble of mods?
    It actually might take a little while this time around. Have to wait for the hentai modders to stop frothing at the mouth first.
"Pokemon but you get to do all the things Nintendo won't let you"
    Yesterday I forced 4 pals into a giant fruit compressor, transformed them all into a smoothie, and made their best bud drink it, and lied to him saying his friends "nobly" sacrificed themselves.


Game is fucked man. It's the most fucked up game without blood I've ever played. I was explaining all the fucked up things you can do in the game to my girlfriend and she couldn't believe it she thought it was basically a pokemon Fascism simulator
        Yesterday I forced a pengullet to build the cleaver I used to kill it
            Like forcing a murder victim to dig their own grave, Jesus Christ...
                I did that exact same thing yesterday with a different Pokemon, but did it in front of all the other pals to set an example as to why you don't start slacking off.

And I'm just saying, they mostly stopped what they were doing and looked at the execution. And they've been great since. So I guess it worked
                    I feel like I'm in a crusader Kings thread
                        Average CK3 thread:

"How to get cucked by my wife, cuck her back and kill her?"

"I want to do eugenics, what stats I should max out on? Should they get the extra long chin trait of an Hapsburg?"

"Where genocide button? I want to kill all those dwarfs!"

"Can I put the bishop up my ass..." (wait, that's r/AnarchyChess)
                            My brother killed my dog so I tried to execute him but failed and started a civil war where in I captured his gay lover who I then made into the anti-pope after killing my brother in combat and turning his wife and our sister into concubines.
                            Sounds a bit like /r/Bannerlord - "My wife is pregnant; what happens if I kill her in the tourney?"
                    So this game is Pokemon, but you're King Leopold II of Belgium.
                I have only played for a few hours but I was laughing when I had a pal hatch from an egg and immediately sent him to build his own bed.
        But, it's still fun.
            It's a better Pok√©mon game than Pok√©mon Scarlet tbh

This game wouldn't have done the numbers it's done if Pok√©mon wasn't shitting out half assed beta builds and actually made a game worthy of the title, hopefully this has made some waves within Nintendo, but I doubt it
                It's not a better pokemon game that Scarlet, it's not a Pokemon game. Plays nothing like it.

Is it a better game than Scarlet/Violet? Fuckin absolutely. But saying it's a better pokemon game is disingenuous. They aren't similar.
                    Plus, people ignoring the Legends Arceus which should‚Äôve been it‚Äôs comparison. Even then, it‚Äôs not a survival game
                Oh they see what happens and honestly, if they don't evolve pokemon they will loose money and that's the last thing they want. Last part I played was perl but I saw the open world part and it was the same? Almost No innovation. But now....
                    The Pokemon games make the least revenue of any of their Pokemon products, they aren't worried. If toy sales dropped, then they would be concerned
                        Also, it's not like pokemon games will stop selling. They sell like fucking crazy even as half assed releases. It's not like people are going to just stop buying pokemon because Palworld exists. Believe it or not people will buy the next pokemon game after having bought palworld.

Its not like Palworld is some revolution in gaming, it's just the game of the moment. 90% of people hoping pokemon crashes and burns because of Palworld will buy the next trash pokemon releases.
                            Or maybe people should hope GameFreak and Nintendo simply builds more on the Legends series they started, which is the closest thing to PalWorld, instead of continuously comparing it to the core series masters release of Scarlett and Violet
                        TBF they all fuel each other. So a drop in game sales would lead to a drop in licensed merch.
                            Yes, this is like saying it doesn't matter how many people see the next Star Wars or Marvel film, the real money is in merch. Nobody is going to buy Iron Man armor 752 from Hot Toys for $700 if the movie that it's in bombs.
                        According to Wikipedia, around 92% of their revenue comes from merchandices, versus 7% from the games.

They really don't need to improve their game to make money. They just need to make new cool and cute creatures.
                    *lose
                >Pok√©mon Scarlet tbh

i mean, it's a completely different game lol. Comparing the two genres is kinda pointless.
                It‚Äôs gamefreak/the Pok√©mon company. Nintendo really doesn‚Äôt have that much control over the ip, they‚Äôre just the publisher. I doubt they‚Äôll step in as long as Pokemon is making money hand over fist. they have to be aware that the recent games are getting a lot of negative attention but until that attention leads to actual consequences then they‚Äôre not gonna care
        it makes sense. the developers cited rimworld as an inspiration for the game.... makes sense....
            Yeah, I'm reading that comment and thinking that is straight up Rimworld. Where I forced a husband to kill his wife and then eat her so he could survive.
        >I forced 4 pals into a giant fruit compressor, transformed them all into a smoothie, and made their best bud drink it, and lied to him saying his friends "nobly" sacrificed themselves.

I ask this sincerely:

Why do you ***want*** to do that????
            It makes the one Pal stronger. 4, 8, 16, then 64. 116 Pals fed into one, to make it 4 star.
                I understand the concept of power-ups so it's nice that it actually accomplishes something but this person seems to be taking particular  delight in feeding them *their friends* and then *lying to them about it*. 

Why so they WANT to do that?
                    It was probably added to have an alternative to just whacking them for food. If you breed for stats the amount of pals you generate is actually ridiculous and you quickly run out of room.
                How much stronger do they get when you go up in stars?
                    They get 1 star stronger every star they go up
                        I guess I meant more in terms of their power/strength. Like if a 0 star pokemon has 100 attack, what does a 2 star pokemon have?
                            It‚Äôs maybe a 5-10% increase to the stats, but more importantly it increases the level of their ability. ¬†Example, better chicken gives more eggs or a mounted pal gets slightly faster. ¬†I will say the buffs to the abilities are way mor noticeable than the stats.
                            There is marginal stat boosts to the core stats like HP/Defense/Attack however all Pals have a "Trait" of some sort, most are passive, like if its rideable or usable as a glider. Increase the star/rank of the Pal upgrades that trait. So Direhowls (wolf) get faster when mounted. Lunaris increases your carry weight more, Daedreams do more damage when out etc etc. I'm assuming the farmable pals would increase drop rate/frequency in the base.
            Right? ‚ÄúThis game is so fucked up, it lets me do the stuff I desire. So fucked up!‚Äù
            By fusing the Pals you increase a Pal from 0 stars to 1 star. It increases their stats and levels up their partner skill. 

I have a 3 star Chicken, I've fed him 52 chickens in the blender. All so that he lays more eggs.
            because I wanted to combine the movie Madagascar and Highlander into a single video game.
        Well, she's not wrong.
        The most inhumane games have the word "world" in it.

Coincidence? I think not
            Looking at you, Rimworld
                Or the worst of all, real world.
            World of Tanks in shambles
        This comment made me decide to buy the game
            Best marketing campaign to sell me on the game.
                the product markets itself has never been truer
                I've never played a single Pokemon game and never wanted to, but damn if I don't want to try Palworld out at this point...
            It did the opposite for me.  Which I think makes this one of the best straight up game reviews I've ever seen?  It *actually tells you* in a single sentence if you'll want the game or not.  That's impressive.
        Oh, hi Cartman. Decided to make a smoothie instead of chili sauce this time?¬†

            In lore they actually enjoy battling, so it's more like you're a boxing trainer than a boxer trainer.
        This is just the level process from Pok√©mon go.
Where for the longest time the only way to level up a Pok√©mon was to mush up his brother's and make them into candy
        Pokemon meets Happy Tree Friends.
        It's Pokemon meets Rimworld meets Ark.

And I'm here for it. Because let's be real, the Pokemon world is totally full of this stuff. Heck, some of the mangas even delve into it with Pokemon getting permanently injured or brutally killed.
        Dude, make a butcher's cleaver and butcher your pal. Its already pixelated in game XD
        Man, im just trying to live in peace with my pals and y‚Äôall over here playing rimworld with them.
        I just unlocked thr cleaver. I have yet to use it, but when that day comes... I'll never be the same.
        Yeah, it's great. The pixellation blur while you savagely butcher your captured pals made me laugh and shake my head in dismay at the same time.
        What. The. Fuck.
            Its worth noting that all of this is a "creative interpretation" if what happens. 
None of this is depicted. You go up to a science machine with no animations, open a menu and pick a few mons from a box. Thats it. It is funny to describe because the game isnt actually showing you anything fucked up.

Its like when people describe some incredibly fucked thing they did in Dwarf fortress or Rimworld. It becomes funny when none of the cruelty is depicted and everything just "technically" happened
                A cruelty occurring onscreen is just gore, one occurring off screen is horror.
        lol sounds like cult of the lamb
        >she couldn't believe it she thought it was basically a pokemon Fascism simulator

is she wrong tho
        I was playing it with a friend on discord when another friend joined in, after listening to us talk for like 10 minutes about stuff like monkey pal special ability being a fucking AK47 he pulls out and starts blazing he asked if we are just fucking with him or are all those things actually in the game
        "Pok√©mon Fascism Simulator" lmao I never thought I'd see this word combination.
    I don't get why people keep pretending they're even the same genre of game.
        The only gameplay aspect that's remotely Pokemon-like is the way you throw balls to catch the creatures.

Combat, crafting, progression, base building, exploration, multiplayer, etc. are all just a more casual/less grindy version of Ark.
        Yeah it‚Äôs not even remotely similar to Pokemon. It‚Äôs reskinned Ark.
            Its reskinned Ark. The reskin makes it look like Pokemon. The Pokemon comparison isn't going anywhere since they literally copied the art style for their monsters.
            Except it's third person, so it's better.
    "Palworld does what Nintendon't"
    Pokemon , but with rule 34 build in.
    "Pokemon but that vaporeon meme you heard one time is real"
    Let‚Äôs revive the old Sega slogan, palworld does what Nintendon‚Äôt
    Honestly, I've been wanting a mature Pok√©mon game for ages.
    Won't let you but are done in the pokemon world, all of it, there is enough evidence to support pokemons being food and also romantic parters to humans throughout the manga xD
        \>No animals exist, only Pokemon.

\>Characters eat meat.

Where does the meat come from Nintendo?
    Including using guns
    Pokemon: nooo we can't have the kids gambling, no more game corner


Palworld:
    For decades people have been making jokes about walking up to a Pokemon and just punching it, shooting Pokemon with a gun instead of battling them, Pokemon dying from another Pokemon's ridiculously strong attack, or where the meat in the Pokemon world comes from. This is just the result.
    Literally. I haven't been able to steal pok√©mon since the Gamecube games and those were my favourite ones. Now I can steal the pals, and the trainers, and I can force them to make me more capturing devices.
Its like they saw that jokerxlopunny meme and said ‚ÄúYES. THAT. But unironically‚Äù
Looks like Vaporeon has some competition.
    I hate that you've reminded me about this.
        Did you know‚Ä¶
            Yes Officer, this comment here
            [Joe Biden knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSn3QqJq1wQ)
                Oh my god this is amazing.  This is what AI is for.
                What's interesting to me is that the AI can't seem to replicate his stutter. Biden has dealt with that his whole life, but its never replicated in these models
                    I feel like Biden wouldn't stutter in this instance, because he's practiced this speech a thousand times.
                    If movies like the King's Speech are to be believed, stutterers frequently do not stutter when they are expressing something they are extremely emotional about, so it checks out here.
                What a world we live in.

Now I want to see a Trump one with his trademark incoherent rambling.
                    Well, I don't have any kind of ai that can do it for you... maybe ElevenLabs? But I will try my best to provide text "worthy" of Trump:

Hey guys, did you know that... in terms of male human, and I know what a male human is, and you know what a male human is, but... not a female human, but a male human.... one that has a... you know.. one that has a... My father was a male and a human, and he told me when I was a kid... my father, Ted Trump, got very wealthy because of the male human, but if you think about male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, and I know you have. Who hasn't? The democrats, probably. They don't have the mind - the brains - to think about something complex like... they're too busy trying to define a male human to even think about breeding one. But if you think about a female Pok√©mon - as I have many times - if you think about one... you know, I met with Satoshi Tajiri, and we talked about Pok√©mon, and he told me, he said, "Ronald," that's what he calls me, Ronald, because they don't do their d's like... they don't do their d's. The Japanese. Very smart. Very smart people. Can't do their d's. He said, "Ronald, you know more about Pok√©mon than anyone at Nintendo. More than me. More than even Nintendo himself." So when I talk about Pok√©mon, you know that what I say is right and true. And when you take into account my father - went to Richmond Hill High School, by the way - and you take into account his knowledge of the male human, and you know that my knowledge - my extensive knowledge - of Pok√©mon, you have to know that Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans. It's true. It is. I wouldn't lie to you. It's Vaporeon. Not only are they in the field egg group, which is the best group, by the way, the only group that has eggs, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. That's big. It's not yuge, but it's big. It's bigger than... it's bigger than all the Pok√©mon that are smaller. The smaller Pok√©mon, they're called that, because they're a bit on the small side. The Vaporeon though, big. Bigly Pok√©mon. But what that means, is this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks. I know. I know. I know what you're thinking, but it's true. It's true. I went to Wharton, you know? It's true. Vaporeon can handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats - not as impressive as me, but impressive - their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Acid Armor, by the way doesn't mean it's made of acid. It means.. you know what it means. It's not... it's not real armor that you can wear. I mean, I can wear it. I can. It's true. It's... I've been known to wear some acid armor from time to time. 

But Vaporeon, due to their mostly water based biology there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet. I've seen Vaporeon before, not in real life, of course, but I've studied the models. I've studied... you know... they put the... these guys and their computers, it's so crazy what they can do now. So many people... I've seen'em. So many people would look at these guys on their computers, and their making with the ai - the artificial intelligence - the... computer brains... they just... They've got these computers, and I've seen'em and seen what they can do, and they showed me, and I understood it. I saw the models, and I knew.. I was asking questions, and they said, "Mr. Trump you know computers?" I said, "Sure I know computers. I'm not just a president, you know. I'm a... I use... you all have seen how much I'm on the computer. I know'em. I know computers. I almost became a programmer when I was in Wharton. I didn't. I decided to become rich instead. Not that programmers can't get rich. They can. You know... STEM... that's a.. they've gotta get more women in STEM. I can fix that. These Democrats, they talk about women and women's right, and they don't even know what a woman is, but I know. You all know that I know what a woman is. If there's anyone that knows what a woman is, it's me. Ha ha ha You know that. I know that.... the women... that's right... they all know that. So I... I see the models, these Vaporeon models, and I see'em, and I know them too, and these computer guys, they show'em to me, and I say to them, "That's a water based Pok√©mon. It's gotta be wet," and they say, "That's right. It is too!" And I see the models, and it's so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. I know that might sound crazy, but it's true. It's true. I've seen the models.

And they can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip. Now, these moves, they don't work on me, but for others, these moves, they would work on them. Along with that, they don't have fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. And who doesn't like being in the mood? With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue, and I tell ya... I tell ya... they would.. if it was me... they would be fatigued. But they can recover from that... that fatigue... with enough water. And I have water. The best water money can buy. It's the BEST water. I wish you could all taste the water I have. It's the best water. So I could use that best water with my Vaporeon, but even then... you don't NEED the best water. No. Vaporeon doesn't need it. But mine would have it.

No other Pok√©mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white.
                        I swear his voice clicked into the narration two sentences in.

    And Mewtwo, Lucario, Salazzle, Gardevoir‚Ä¶
I've been looking to catch one of those >:)
    They may raid your base at some point
        I'll welcome them with open arms
            Sounds great until they kill all your pets and level your base
                Kinky
                Even with just mainly basic shit at the base, it's been harder for me to catch anything that raids. 

They seem to die too quickly
                    I'm kinda okay with it since I seem to get raids every 20-25 minutes if I'm hanging out at the base lol.  Kind of annoying I basically need to be AWAY from all my work stations and base as a whole otherwise the game seems to detect me step close in proximity and just laughs and says RAID TIME BITCH.
                        ...sooo...The Forest, with Pokemon?
                    Surround your base with enough traps that is outside of your ~~Slaves~~ Pals alarm raidus.  LOL
                        I tried that. But had to constantly reset the traps because I kept getting chickens, cats, and sheep. Lol. Then got annoyed enough that I just said screw it.
            Might as well with wide open legs
            Death by snu snu
        That's how I got her and Swee.
 
Now I run a brothel out of out of the ruins of a cathedral.
            what
                Well, you see... When two pals love each other dearly...
 
They play monopoly!
 
That way they can tell just how good they are at getting screwed by the other.
                    and If we Play Catan, we can see how into rough stuff they are.
                        Do you have wood for sheep?

    I'm gonna go build my own Pok√©mon, with blackjack and hookers!
First slaanesh now this
    Truly, humanity will be doomed by its own horniness.


That being said... I'd hit it.
Am I missing out on Palworld? I don‚Äôt have time to grind an Ark style game but it seems like dumb fun. Also worried this could get shut down any second haha
    When you make a world, you can set exp rate, harvest rate, spawn rate, etc to extraordinary levels so there‚Äôs virtually no grind!
        Not to mention the base rate is insanely generous with how much you get for the first 10 captures.

if you want to get exp you can reliably gain multiple levels in like 30 minutes of just messing around
        It's really only a few times where the slow contruction rate feels grindy, but overall pretty fun. 

Me Personally? I'm playing the hell out of the new prince of persia right now. But I'm a huge sucker for SWAGGY metroidvanias, even if they are from ubi :(
            [deleted]
                [deleted]
    It's really not a huge grind, even standard rate is pretty quick. Make sure to level carry capacity over anything else
        prioritize carry capacity. 

at most, 1000 base hp maximum.

then stamina to a comfortable level (personal preference).

*edited and reworded to make more sense.*
            Yeah agreed on this. Being able to efficiently capture a ton of pals will help you level up faster (HP and stamina). Just be sure to build your first base on a spot with some resources (at least a couple ore veins and trees)
            Really? I'm over level 20 I have only put one point in health and I kinda wish I put it somewhere else
        FYI there's a few pals who will boost your carry capacity in your team, and generally are strong world bosses so are decent team members. If you can catch a few of them, you can condense them to power up just one of them and make their special ability (carry capacity) more powerful (presumably, I've only boosted the speed of my mounts so far). You'd probably need to breed them to get enough to condense though.
        I feel its better to focus on HP and stamina because you can always take Pals that increase your carry capacity when you need to go harvesting.  You can also use the Pal condenser to increase their bonus carrying capacity.
    There's a sort of grind, but the Pals can harvest resources for you.  It's like if your Anky, Dodic, and Beaver harvested resources while Dodos carried everything back to your storage boxes.  

When crafting, materials are pulled from all boxes within your base, too - like S+ from ASE - so you don't have to hold all the mats to craft things.
        God this is such a nice QoL change for survival games. Not having to have the mats on me to make shit is amazing.
    I've played for a bit it's not really grindy...you can let your slav- I mean poke- I mean pals grind for you
        Heh... there's literally nothing to do in the game outside of grinding. Your goals are :

* Beat the towers (level 10/20/30/40/50), which requires a high level with good pals.
* Raise your level, which requires killing/capturing a *bunch* of pals.
* Complete the paldex, which requires capturing/breeding/hatching 10 of each specis.
* Get better pals, either through 1/9000 capture chances, or a shitton of breeding.
* Level up your base, by gathering *hundreds* of materials to build the next tier of building, with only the first tier of materials being natively automated (stone/wood), outside of a few exception (couple of pals can be ranched for mats).

It's definitely a fun grind (imo, to each their own), but it's literally only a grinding game.
            I find it laughable how people are calling this the Pokemon killer when their gameplay, besides catching creatures using balls, are not even close in similarity.
    This game has been on development for near 3 years and Nintendo would have been very aware of it. Maybe the developers say f it and bail with the money but I doubt that would happen.¬†


Now paid pokemon mods, those will get shut down.¬†
        Apparently the devs went on record stating they had multiple legal teams scour the game for any IP infringement and came away clean. Doesn't mean they couldn't still get sued, but they are confident they would win if they did.
    I don't like Pokemon games, they've just always bored me, but I've been digging Palworld. It's on Gamepass though, wouldn't have bought it otherwise.

None of my friends play games but I bet that's a good time in palworld
    1st, I wouldn't worry about it getting a C&D.  There's no way Nintendo didn't know about this game during it's development and, if they had smelled blood in the water, they would have killed it long ago.  NAL, but with how litigious Nintendo is it only makes sense.  


2nd, it is basically Ark but w/ Pals (pokemon) instead of Dinosaurs.  The big difference here is that as you catch Pals and level up, you get to automate the more monotonous parts of the game.  For instance, my Fiance and I have a base that is constantly generating the resources we need to build the fun things to keep going out and catching Pals and changing our home design to fit the new stuff we've unlocked.  


Also, when you make a game, you can choose "Custom Settings" to customize exp gain, harvest rate, work rate, spawn rate, etc etc etc to your liking.  So if you really want to just unlock stuff fast and have fun catching pals WITHOUT the survival crafting part impacting your gameplay much, you can!
    Nintendo doesn't give two shits about Palworld. Their only statement was literally "we're aware the game exists please shut the hell up and stop emailing us"


You can change the rates of your world. Higher catch rate, take less damage, do more damage, gather resources significantly faster, lessen hunger, disable raids, etc etc.¬†


Highly recommended. It's extremely fun and perfectly casual friendly.¬†
    I ended up refunding it. I didn't like the feel of the game I guess. There was no battle system like in the Pok√©mon games. I wanted to do battle with the other Pok√©mon (Pals) that I caught. And the crafting took forever... having to hold down x for over a minute to craft a few items is a stupid way to extend the grind of a game. A single button press should suffice. Or even just like, 5 seconds. I was literally holding the button for over 60 seconds, since each item took like 6 to complete and I wanted to make a bunch.

I just wasn't having fun. Maybe your mileage will vary, maybe I was playing it wrong. It felt confusing to me.
    Its the same early access survival crafting shit as 100 other games. With pokemon thrown in.
    You get exp boost for catching 10 of the same pal. I think there is also a slider to control how much exp you want your save file to give, in its difficulty settings.
    If your smart and efficient on what poke.. I mean pals you assign to work at your base you level up quickly and don‚Äôt spend a lot of time gathering resources.

Also, it‚Äôs on game pass. Microsoft wouldn‚Äôt have allowed this game of this nature to go onto game pass without looking into potential copyright infringement issues.
    Just turn up the sliders, higher XP, more drops. Etc
    If Dicktendo could shut this down they'd already done so, it has to be an 1:1 copy for them to win. Also this game has been in dev since ages long before AI was used this often.
    It is exactly that - dumb fun.  It's also surprisingly good though, not just a gimmick game.  If you're into those sort of games of course.
Legends: ARKeus.
Wow, I thought that last panel was a joke, but nope, #69 is a bipedal feminine-humanoid lizard that will get frisky with anything it sees:

> Seeking a night of love, it is always chasing someone around. At first, it only showed interest in other Pals, but in recent years even humans have become the target of its debauchery.

Good to see a game troll pokemon.
I'm truly wondering how many of the people are saying it's just "Pokemon with guns" have played ARK. It's MUCH more of an ARK clone than anything outside of it's character designs.

Yes there's pokemon-esq designs, knock off pokeballs, and a "Pokedex", but that's really where the comparisons stop. You can't even evolve your monsters in Palworld. It's not even close to other games that are similar to pokemon like SMT, MH stories, Cassette Beasts, Monster Sanctuary, any Digimon game. All of which have almost all of those things yet nobody is shitting on those. 

The tech tree, inventory/menus, crafting, ridable/usable monsters, stats, even setting up your own world is almost carbon copied from ARK. Even down to the goofy character creation.

There is so much silly drama over this game lmao
    None of the people complaining about it have played ark
    My exact reaction to the trailer was that it looked like ARK with pokemon.

And I didn't think there was anything wrong with that.
        Oh I shamelessly love ARK, flaws and all. I just think it's funny that the immediate comparison is to Pokemon
    Drama maybe working for them as form of advertising for the game.
Noice.
    Nice.
This comic is the Palworld of Dunkey‚Äôs review of Palworld
    You Are Nitpicking and Biased, I Win, Bye Bye
    Idk if Dunkey is being sarcastic on his review, or he legitimately played the game in the most boring way.

He made a stone pit and a logging facility but didn't use it and instead mined the materials like a noob.
The slaaneshi cultists have breached containment. Requesting backup.
Please dont tell me you can literally fuck the pals, I just wanna build a slave empire goddamnit
    Not yet unfortunately

I mean fortunately. Fortunately you cannot do that. Why would you want to
        I give it a month and there will be a porn mod, Im fucking calling it, I'm betting my left testicle on it

Remindme! 1 month

edit, i get to keep my left testicle
            There's already a nudity mod for thr player character
                I mean nude mods aren't technically porn mods, nice try attempting to steal my left testicle off the bet
                    Damn! I really need a replacement...
                        I just want another one. Three ball blues.
                        Your chin will be fine
                    I mean, back in my day nudie mags were porn. 

God i'm old.
            And they miss one if they don't call it: Pal Porn with the Porn Pal. And you can donate with PayPal.
            I guarantee you it was done before the game was even released.
                Inside job
            If that. Those Loverslab folks are *quick*.
            Just wait and there will be a harem version that replaces all the pals with random anime waifus.
                A downgrade
        Just wait for the mods
        Yet.
        Freudian slip, huh.
        Can't spell bestiality without best.
    Only implied in the deck description of that pal. You gotta wait for the modding scene to start
        I wonder if at some point we'll be able to make brothels
            110%

I have a feeling this mod community is going to turn it up to GTA levels of debauchery. I‚Äôm so here for it, but I also fully expect it to result in controversy when it gets that far
    Only if you like to watch by throwing human and Pal in the breeding ranch.
        I didn't think of doing that. I feel like it's good that I didn't think of that.
    No, but you can hold hands with her, which is worse.
    Nah, thats breeders of the nephylim.
I'd take this game over the modern pokemon games anyday.

Alot of content and gameplay mechanics, a perfect mix between pokemon and ark survival and for half the price.
I think Palworld is here to stay and leave its own mark.
    Definitely shows a huge interest in monster catching games. People want a more advanced ‚ÄúPokemon‚Äù game. Palworld literally hits all the things I would wish Pokemon would do.
        There has been other monster catching games in the past, most of them are Pokemon-like. Palmon helped catch people who are into monster catching, but are not looking for a Pokemon-like.

Monster Hunter for instance has it's own Pokemon styled game, but it would be crazy if you kept the combat of Monster Hunter, but included a way to tame the monsters to fight with you.  They almost have something like that in Rise, but is definitly not built to be played in a way like Palworld is.
            The problem with other ‚Äúmonster catching‚Äù game and the reason why none of them have even gotten a fragment of Pok√©mon‚Äôs impact (with exception of SMT/Persona which carved it‚Äôs own niche) is because they all focus on the turn-based battle aspect with Type strengths/weaknesses which Pok√©mon already mastered, making them all just ‚ÄúPok√©mon you play while waiting for the next real Pok√©mon game‚Äù
Palworld instead focuses on the idea of you SURVIVING and eventually thriving in this world. It‚Äôs what got to many people hyped for PLA in the first place (the idea of you sneaking under the tall grass stalking Pok√©mon while you could be attacked by a wild Pok√©mon without realising). This is a real alternative to the Monster Catching genre which none of Pok√©mon‚Äôs current supposed competitors offer
        Persona is technically a monster-catching game - it has guns too!
            It's also a fucking chore 'catching' monsters in it.
                "Look Beelzebub, I just want to talk."
            Yeah, but Persona's gimmick is that it's like 90% of the same monsters every game.
        Everybody is just sleeping too much on Monster Girl Quest Paradox. 

What everybody really wants is for *all* monsters to be fuckable.
        I've never desired to make my pokemon do manual labor in slave like conditions or shove my pokemon into a blender and feed it to the others, but to each their own I guess...
        I grew up loving Pokemon but it doesn't seem like anything about those games has significantly changed in nearly 30 years, if anything, they've gotten worse quality wise. I don't know if that's because Game Freak just doesn't know how to do a 3d game well, if the Switch hardware is hamstringing them, or a combination.

It's the sort of franchise that seems to be happy delivering roughly the same experience to the new generation coming up than it does maintaining interest with people as their tastes change. I can't really blame them, either, it's not like the market has told them anything different with how those games continue to sell amd Nintendo is apparently comfortable not attempting to chase a wider market.
        > Palworld literally hits all the things I would wish Pokemon would do.

Pokemon cannibalism?
    Anyone remember temtem?
        TemTem lost much of its initial appeal by going the GAAS/MMO route
            Not even that.  If they had done an MMO style game with actual MMO style updates it probably would be fine.  Instead, the devs said they aren't releasing expansions, aren't releasing new Tems, and don't plan on doing much patching at all.  You basically have all the downsides of an MMO with literally no upside.
            Yeah, Man. I have it for  the steam deck and every time i've tried to play it, the Always Online thing is such a pain in the butt.
        That was the devs shooting themselves in the foot deliberately + greed more than anything, unless palworld devs are lobotomized they have a real chance of sticking
            I thought the drop off was the devs saying ‚Äúgames done, no new tems. No dlc or expansions‚Äù.
                Yeah that's what I was referring to when I said shooting themselves in the foot, should have specified mb

As for the greed bit, I was told some in game prices were inflated with 'longevity' or some other BS as the reason
                    Didn't they go crazy with cosmetics and stuff? Just from reading steam reviews.
                    Ah. I never played it. Didn‚Äôt realize it had a micro transaction shop.
                The "screw you, we got ours" approach.
        I was hopeful for Temtem but honestly it just kind of sucked. 

It failed to have features Pokemon had since the very first gameboy game, like battle speed options. Every single battle is a slog because the combat is slow and any time an ability triggers the game pauses to tell you about it even if it's an ability that triggers constantly like "fire type moves do +10% damage". The map design isn't awful, but the placement of NPCs is. Windward Fort has the sort of design where wild pokemon spawn everywhere inside every few steps you take like Pokemon Caves, and they still jam-packed the place with 14 unskippable NPC battles and some skippable ones too. It's miserable, there are rooms you enter where you can see the exit but there's a congo line of 5 or 6 people just hanging out blocking the path. There's one room where you have to fight the NPCS "Overconfident Belsoto, Conceited Belsoto, Reckless Belsoto, Foolish Belsoto, and Undeceived Belsoto" one at a time in a forced hallway, while the random battles still spawn in too, and I recall this room because by NPC 4 I was like "this is such a time waster, do I even want to keep playing". FreeTem! as a system expects you to catch and release 50-400 creatures every week to get middling rewards, and this is a massive time sink because of how long battles take with no battle speed option. 


Temtem also added things that purely made the experience worse. Forced online and forced to see other players in the world constantly. This wouldn't be so bad, but the game is not optimized well and even on a really good PC I lag every time I go to an area that is important (like the towns) because the game has to load tons of people and their follower creatures in. The reason they force this at all is because the game is filled to the brim with microtransactions and part of the "value" of spending money on them is that you get to hold other players hostage and force them to see whatever silly hat you bought. I love buying clothes in the Pokemon games because it doesn't cost real money and there's no trouble from it, but Temtem does stuff like make changing item color use up expensive single use consumable items so they can keep getting you to spend on more of them, a far worse system only so they can squeeze money out of people. There are tons of systems designed to annoy you and advertise to you, like the classic battlepass where you get scraps for free and have to scroll past all the actually decent stuff you "earned" but can't have without paying for the pass, and a rotating shop of purchasable items where something like 5/6 are premium currency only and they put 1 mediocre item that can be bought with in-game currency at the very end of the list to force you to scroll past the paid stuff just to find out it's the same chair you have for free just painted a different shade of brown.

Temtem is not a game trying it's best to be a Pokemon killer, it's trying to squeeze money out of people and waste their time. The very first black and white pokemon games did a better job of respecting player time and giving a game that is enjoyable.
        God the NPC's in that game are ugly
        RemindMe! 6 months
    I give it like 3-4 months
    People will forget about it in 2 months, just like every other fad game
Is the game like Pok√©mon meets Ark meets Conan: exiles?
    I didn't think to compare it with conan exiles yet but yeah I suppose a case can be made for it. I definatly would call it an ark meets pokemon game. It has an engram system like ark. It has pals which basically is pokemon which u catch by bringing their hp low and throw a ball at them. U got shinies, elements etc. It's fun.
    A game similar to ark is automatically going to be similar to Conan to be fair. Wildcard recycled a lot of code between them.
‚ÄúGentlemen you had my curiosity ... but now you have my attention.‚Äù
This game just seems like a preteen fanfic someone actually managed to program
I'm honestly tired of the comparison to Pokemon. Palworld is less Pokemon than other competitors that have been around for years are. Digimon is much closer to Pokemon than Palworld is. Palworld is a survival game with monsters that you can catch and train, pretty much where the similarities end.
    Palworld is more Pokeark.
        Palword is literally Craftopia (PocketPair's last game, that's still in EA 4+ years) evolved.

To which Craftopia was a Zelda/Pokemon etc. rip-off.
            Good god playing that game blind knowing nothing going in was a WILD ride. 

"Oh hey they got the glide thing from Zelda......oh hey they got a straight up deku nut from Zelda.....wait, is that a tank? And a machine gun???" 

It's like the developers were like "oh hey I like this thing" and tossed whatever they could.
    Its literally ARK but the creatures do more than just stand still on the base pooping everywhere.
        Moreover, there just isn't poop in the game! At least I think, haven't seen any yet.
    It's a survival game with Pokemon. That's really it

I do find the "this is what Pokemon should be" crowd to be pretty amusing, though. If Gamefreak made a game with the mechanics of Palworld everyone who shit on it for not having pretty much any of the staples of a Pokemon game
        Pokemon should 100% not be Palworld. There are aspects it can learn from, but mechanically they should not be the same.
        Didn't Legends Arceus provide a somewhat fresh take on the gameplay and receive a ton of praise? Plus other spin-off games like Mystery Dungeon and Ranger are well-liked.

Pokemon fans are definitely receptive to a change in the formula, but it's far easier for Gamefreak to shit out the formulaic main series games, kids will buy it in droves regardless of quality.
    Nah they know what they‚Äôre doing. The entire hype behind the game is based on how similar many elements are to Pokemon
        But when you play the game, you don't encounter those elements. There is no evolving your Pals, or Pal battles (though in their roadmap they want to Pal battles), or badges, etc. The game through and through is a survival game. Like many have said it is way more a "rip-off" of Ark than it is Pokemon. Swap out dinosaurs for monsters and boom that is Palworld. Digimon, Cassette Beasts, TemTem, and many others take way more inspiration from Pokemon than Palworld does.
            This is why I keep looking up info about this game. It doesn't look anything like Pokemon to me and yet everyone swears its what Pokemon should be.

Starting to think the people saying this just don't like Pokemon, at its core, which is fine but like why not just talk about Palworld on its own merits?

Similarly the people trying to bring it down or sending in reports to Nintendo are just fucking weird. Why do we spend so much time do corporation work for them lmfao?
                Agreed for sure. I love Pok√©mon and while it's had its flaw in recent years. People do not (or can not at this point) talk about Palworld without talking about Pok√©mon. Palworld is not what Pok√©mon should or could be aside from graphics, but nobody specifies when they talk about it.

IMO, the more Pok√©mon gets brought up when talking about Palworld, the less Palworld actually compares on its own.
                    Yeah I think Palworld can suffer long term if it keeps bringing people in under the assumption it's giving the Pokemon experience.

I also think the edgy tone to the gameplay might lose older players after a while. It's a great hype and streamer game so far like Lethal Company. I'm hoping they can convert that into something that stands on its own but the first step is to escape being derivative of a game not even in the same genre lol.
                >everyone swears its what Pokemon should be.

>Starting to think the people saying this just don't like Pokemon, at its core, which is fine but

THANK YOU for summarizing this. I like Palworld but all the Pokehate is driving me nuts. Pokemon is the goat. No, I'm not buying any of the new games because I'm not dumb, but a cool **turn-based RPG** where you collect the monsters you face and go on an adventure is also fun! And clearly a lot of people like it!

Again, I'm pro-Palworld, but mostly because it's a cheap game from a small studio. Yeah it's fun enough, but I would never want to punch rocks or tolerate this much jank in an actual Pokemon game. If I had to guess, I'd assume an older Pokemon game I never played before like Emerald would be overall more fun.

I want Pokemon to evolve but by making better games, not by switching to the punch rocks genre.
                I would never attempt to replace Pokemon with Palworld. Pokemon is a much more structured RPG experience, and while I think the modern games are pretty terrible, the older games are homeruns in that formula. Palworld is an unstructured, player driven experience that wouldn't fit the Pokemon design at all.

That being said, there are elements of Palworld that Pokemon can learn from. For example, being able to throw out any rideable Pal and actually ride them. In Pokemon, we always had place holder sprites or rental/specific Pokemon we would have to ride. Makes it more immersive if you would actually ride your Pokemon.
                its because palworld does not have its own merits to talk about‚Ä¶ All of its pal designs are copied over from pokemon and edited slightly, its janky and unpolished‚Ä¶ Their previous games are ALSO knockoffs of popular games (Botw and Hollow Knight). You don‚Äôt see this kind of popularity with those, because people in those communities actually have *standards* lol
                It might not play like Pok√©mon, but it very intentionally looks like Pok√©mon. Take the big yellow Pal in this meme. Are you really saying it doesn‚Äôt strongly resemble one specific Pok√©mon?
                    It's electric Totoro.

It looks more like Electabuzz than Pikachu if that's what you're implying
                        Electabuzz is the obvious answer
                    I am talking from a purely gameplay perspective. You could put any cartoonish animal in front of me and I would on some level think it looks like a Pokemon that's just how brand recognition goes.
            Right but it intentionally has a coat of paint to resemble pokemon right down to the names
            I don't know why people keep saying Digimon. Yeah the name is similar and you have to take care of a "creature" but that's basically where it ends. That goes for the shows, games, and overall theme (except for tbe friendship is magic thing, but all media for children does this). The majority of Digimon games play NOTHING like Pokemon. 

Palworld is definitely closer to Pokemon than Digimon
        That's not even the case, it's has some monster catching mechanics and some related names to pokemon (pokedex, pokeballs etc)  and that's basically it, it's among the other 10 types of game mechanics in the game, Pokemon didn't even "invent" this type of games... cathing monster were a thing way before pokemon. It's like if I added guns to super mario bros and say super mario is a rip off of Call of Duty because both have guns and fps mechanics, makes no sense lol... people are just mad that pokemon didn't make a decent game in years and a random indie studio with 4 guys in a basement did what they would not achieve even if invested billions in it.  
The entire hype of this game is that it got several random game mechanics together to work that most games wouldn't make even 1 work like having guns, crafting, survival, boss fights, base building etc, while most survival games fuck up with crafting or that every other catching monsters game sucks in the last 10 years(including pokemon) even if all they had was 1 job.
    Come on man, let‚Äôs not try to blind ourselves.  They very clearly have ripped off countless Pok√©mon.  It‚Äôs fine to call them out for it and still like the game
    Man, the Digimon IP would work GREAT as a survival/crafting/capture game. Palworld could be a 1:1 swap with Digimon assets and it wouldn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúwrong‚Äù like a Pok√©mon swap.
    "I'm sick and tired of people pointing out the MAIN MARKETING GIMMICK OF THIS GAME!"

Geez, I wonder why they point it out, it couldn't possibly be because of the company blatantly ripping off of Pok√©mon aesthetic in order to sell their product.
    Hey don't insult Digimon like that
It's not pokemon with guns. It's breath of the wild with pokemon.
    Ark Survival with pokemon
It‚Äôs like Pok√©mon, but edgy!
And we're all here for it.

Fuck Nintendo, they could do it but they just don't
    They will however liscense a huge data harvesting operation utilizing their brand via PokemonGo
    Nintendo wouldn't make a game like this, palworld just uses non-pokemon to enhance and further the game, it's more like arc survival then anything.
Not ganna mention the flame demons that raid sometimes and just burn your base to the ground because fuck you that‚Äôs why?
I'm convinced this game was made to be the best shitpost of all time
Sales after players find #69 in palworldüìàüìàüìàüìà
Lol I still don‚Äôt understand the appeal of this game. Does not look like anything special.
    A commend on dunkey‚Äôs video said something along the lines of ‚Äúit‚Äôs like they shoved every pre-release game into one experience‚Äù and that very much fit the vibe from what I‚Äôve seen of it.
    Feels like it‚Äôs target audience are people who hate Nintendo. Haven‚Äôt played it myself but damn the bar seems reaaaaally low.
        Tbf a lot of people hate Nintendo not for petty reasons but because Nintendo has been making shit Pok√©mon games. It‚Äôs a lot easier to accept a potentially lacklustre game from a small studio than to accept a bad game from Nintendo itself.

To have a smaller studio come out with something that rivals the quality of modern Pok√©mon games with very very similar game feel is an easy catch. It‚Äôs the same reason people got so hyped for fan games of Pok√©mon, the quality is so good and it legit rivals modern Pok√©mon content, AND your expectations aren‚Äôt high because it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs game freak.

If you have a Pok√©mon itch that needs scratching, this game can hit it. But at the same time it‚Äôs a twist on the genre. Hell even the line ‚ÄòPok√©mon with guns‚Äô sounds like fun if you like those games. Are there issues with quality and creativity? Yes. If that bothers you don‚Äôt buy it, it‚Äôs expensive for early access imo. But it f you enjoy games of this genre you will at least like this game.
        Ive seen some ppl defend the designs by going ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about nintendo so idc if they plagiarize the pokemon designs‚Äù‚Ä¶, so yeah this is it
Jesus Christ, can't you guys just get over it and fuck already?
Ok so whats so bad about palworld ive heard nothing but drama but no one ever tells me whats so wrong about it im assuming its just butthurt fanboys
    It is one of the most successful games on Steam, selling more than 7(?) million copies in a few days and got the second highest concurrent players ever at around 2 million players.

Part of the drama comes from the game's main gimmick: on the surface, it appears to be a cutesy Pokemon like game, but in reality it has a dark/edgy sense of humor where you catch Pals (and humans) and force them to work for you. You can also kill the Pals (unlike Pokemon where they only go unconscious) and there are guns in the game. A similar comparison would be the TV show Happy Tree Friends (look it up at your risk), something that appears to be cute but then turns out to be dark and horrific in ways.

I think the other part of the drama is that people are split on this game: it is wildly successful, that can't be denied, and people will talk about it like it's one of the greatest games ever made. But other people argue that it is basically just another cookie-cutter, bland Early Access survival/crafting asset flip that the devs might just take the money and run and stop updating the game.
Dunkey
tons of jokes in Brasil with this game
The "Noice" is a nice touch. üëå
Make your billions so when you get fined any amount is a slap on the wrists...today's way of doing business.
I still refuse to look up what the hell paleworld is.
Idk Enshrouded is better
It also stole its visual style from Fortnight.
Wait is top right panel true? I didn't even consider that as an option.
    Yeah, I tried it the other day just for shits and giggles, and it actually worked. I was shocked
Then we have the team who did the Brazilian translation of the game and oh boy, those guys had a lot of fun and we know it. 

Think of it this way: this game in English would be called something like Knobworld. And then the translation team just have gone absolutely genius by using the world knob in a lot of mischievous situations, like "knob fluids", one of the first human encounters, when the NPC tells you that they haven't seen someone with a strong knob scent in a while or just the general instructions, because you are expected to beat, catch and ride on knobs. 

Yeah, it is pretty much like that. And it is hilarious, absolutely wonderful. And the game is good and fun too, but damned be me, if we are not having a lot of fun just with the translation.
This is so close to loss
the number of syndicate I've thrown into the juicer to empower their comrades is pretty big, we're talking sims death per hour numbers.
Well, this games going to get some adult only mods ..
    It has already begun.
I am really enjoying this game though
The first thing I did was build a sweatshop‚Ä¶. Then eventually I destroyed that sweatshop and built a castle for my slaves‚Ä¶.. where they all sleep outside so that when PETA comes my slaves can burn and electrocute them to death while I‚Äôm off somewhere with my big cat witch bitch looking for more creatures to enslave. 

And I only need like 32 more fake flareons to juice so that my flame thrower will get stronger.
Wait this aint rimworld?
pal gal
We‚Äôve been using animals to plow fields for thousands of years, no? Why‚Äôs everyone calling this slavery? It‚Äôs just for the memes right?
Are all 4 of these things in the game, or is it just jokes. Cause if they are, then I might consider buying it cause weaponised pokemon are fire.
And maybe we can recreate Oppenheimer
Yallre actually horny for lovander? It's some of the most obvious furry bait I've ever seen
Nintendo really dropped the ball.
Wait you can catch npc‚Äôs bro im so trying this tonight lol
Number 69 in Pokemon is *checks* Bellsprout.
Noice.
    Noice.
        Noice.
            Noice.
Yeah man, like save some of that for the rest of us. There's plenty to go around. Sharing is Caring.
    Wonder if any of the Pals can make the penicillin that some of you are gonna need?
        I'd be more interested in the diabetes cure from all that cotton candy for the factory workers
        Luckily enough, lovander's level 2 in medicine production. Also, unrelated, but it has level 2 in handiwork and drops suspicious juice, so take that as you will.
        I mean, making medicine is a skill isn't it?

so probably?
    Imagine a true Rimworld/Dwarf Fortress experience where Pal number 69 may have a chance to give you an STD.
Gotta fuck‚Äôem all
    bro   be carefull or u will become a furry
        Speaking from experience, I see


Edit: no judging tho :3
        What a horrible tragedy that could be...
    Sigh........ [obligatory ](https://youtu.be/CVqsQ-9GLLE?si=3CEMFIpbcNYd0Z5W)
There are no rules in the palworld, batman
And here are your new Pals

Syphilis
Gonorrhea
And Chlamydia.
Lol, you think that until you go to the animal sanctuary or try to capture a civilian, and cops with enough firepower to blow away your entire team start appearing out of thin air. It‚Äôs pretty funny.
    Do cops actually show up at the sanctuary? I saw the constant "criminal activity" message but nothing happened no matter how many Pals I caught/killed in an attempt to catch.
        Yeah kill enough and they'll constantly spawn like 10 level 50s on you
            So what you're saying is that i can have a squad of Cops as Pals?
                Yeah sort of but they're real annoying (along with annoying music). Will spawn on you while flying too lol
                    How in the world do you get them to stop pursuing? Only way I can see is to just die
                        > Only way I can see is to just die

That's what my friend and I did ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the internet said you can kill everyone and it'll stop, but they just kept spawning - it seemed impossible to down them all at once before more showed up.  We're also only levels ~15-20, so maybe that's easier as you level up.
                            Don't attack them yourself, you'll get more assault charges and it'll spawn more. Just let your pals take care of them, there might be 1 or 2 waves of respawns but they *will* stop after that. I frequent the no.1 reserve because I'm really trying to get a 4-star Petalia
                They dont fire their weapons after becoming pals. They just do melee attacks. Disappointing.
                    You can teach them other moves
                        Did they fix the glitch where they won‚Äôt use those moves, or do they actually work now?
        If one of the guards sees you attacking one of the creatures, you get an alert sound that sounds an awful lot like the, "you committed a crime!" alert sound from Cyberpunk 2077, then a "Wanted!" box shows up in the top right corner, and then the guards start attacking you.
            Huh, there wasn't any cops there when I was. Guess I have to go commit crime again to see if they were just on break.
                From what I've seen

As you start capturing and knocking out pals in the reservation. Guards start taking up those slots more often than pals do.

A reservation will start with like 2 guards and will eventually have 20+ and no more pals.

 Getting spotted means certain death, but the rare pals are worth it.
                    >Getting spotted means certain death, but the rare pals are worth it.

This has so much "African rhino poacher vs hardcore rangers" energy, it's making me ponder some major worldbuilding connotations for Palworld.
                    Does it reset the # of guards after you die or something?
                        When you get far away enough everything de-spawns and will spawn back in when rendered.

So unless you have a palbox on the reserve (which I haven't tried) everything should repopulate normally.

I've had problems losing lucky pals by getting too far away from them. Once they un-render, pals don't seem to stay.
                    Question: can you capture the Guards? Haven't started playing yet, but this sounds like a great way to get a lot of human pals if so...
        I've only crimed once, but it was kinda like GTA stars.  A single assault got the people nearby mad at me.  Once I hit 3, it started spawning level 24s.  At 5 assaults, they were level 30, and at 10 or so I was seeing level 50s.  They spawned in all around me (probably ~3 of them to start, up to 10ish at the peak), even after fast traveling somewhere else
        "Criminal activity" doesn't do anything by itself, but those islands spawn cops. If any cop gets line of sight on you while you have that status, you'll become a wanted criminal for trespassing.¬† And if you attack a cop while another cop can see you, you'll become wanted for assault, as well.


To be clear, "line of sight" for them is a sight cone with some maximum range.¬† You have a little wiggle room.¬† Surprisingly, you can even shoot them from out of range of their sight, and they won't "see" you for criminal purposes until you get close enough.
Batman, I -I
I caught uh-
I caught a little Pokemon.
Do you wanna know
What Pokemon I caught?

What Pokemon did you catch, Joker?

I caught a Lopunny, Batman
I caught a Lopunny

Oh No, Joker
Don't tell me

You already know, Batman
You know what I'm gonna do
TO THAT THING!

JOKER!
It's an animal, Joker!
You can't-

BATMAN, THERE IS NO LAWS AGAINST THE POKEMON, BATMAN!
I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT WITH IT!

NO OH MY GOD! NO!

I'M GONNA DO IT, BATMAN!
    The fact the Lopunny is completely OK with this in the animation and actually seems happy/excited scares me.
        Lopunny has enough PP that it doesn‚Äôt need to struggle.
            o_o
            Angry upvote.
            There are a few ways to interpret this‚Ä¶
            And it‚Äôs about to get some more PP‚Ä¶
            Not when they have infinite stamina potions
            Holy shit the layers in this comment
        For all we know she thinks joker is just a weird Mr mime
            Mr. Mime and Lopunny are in the same egg group.
                The only group I'd have for Mr. Mime in real life is "kill on sight".
                    That's a lot of Pok√©mon to be fair.
                    My grouping would be 5.25 inches at 50 yards.
                Mr. Mime (Gotham Form)

Instead of saying 'Mime' or 'Mr. Mime' the Gotham form of Mr. Mime often says strange things about scars and society.
        wait. this is a thing?
            https://youtu.be/VZllAa1odpU?si=YqQnUbSFQn4ecFU4
        Probably thinks Joker is an ugly Mr. Mime.

        WTF did I just experience
            That is what is called *art.*
            Joker is somehow worse when he isn't breaking laws.

                I‚Äôve seen this before but it reminded me of how Batman will sometimes hook up with Barbara. Like, yeah they should rethink that.
                    > Batman will sometimes hook up with Barbara

Bruce Timm has done great things for Batman, but his weird Bruce/Babs thing always drags him down a bit.
                        Who's the guy who said heros don't perform cunnilingus?
                            Iirc it was D.C. Editorial.

The Harley Quinn cartoon wanted to put in a scene of him going down on Catwoman and D.C. said ‚ÄúNo, we won‚Äôt be able to sell toys of him if he goes down on her.‚Äù
                                I would buy a statue or action figures of Batman going down on Catwoman and I'm not even a comic fan, just a cunnilingus fan
            Oh you¬¥re in for a treat

    I was kind of confused because it called out Batman, but I definitely read this in Morty's voice.

Actually if you try to put a friendly NPC in a ball the feds turn up and you end up wanted like in GTA and they gun you down for kidnapping

However if you get raided, raiders are fair game
    They use US prison system rules I see
    I wonder what constitutes friendly. I caught one of the level 5 guys squatting by a campfire, and nothing seemed to happen.
    You spared their lives, they owe you.... so they get to work whatever you darn well tell them
Is this an Aslume joke Im not aware of?
    Jonkler catches a lopunny
I've seen a guy named OSHA_inspector going around. I don't know if he is into roleplay, but the meme alone got a laugh out of me.
"YOU'RE BEING RAIDED BY PALS THAT WANT TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND"

Wat.
    Actually it‚Äôs ‚Äúcrazed fan girls‚Äù. So basically the same thing.
        I honestly thought npc‚Äôs were coming. I had no idea these things existed before they tore through my camp
        Fangirls that can't contain their love for you.
            Ey there's the way-too-long-name I couldn't remember!
        The raid names seem to change a bit. Mine was "Bandwagon Fan Girls" when we first encountered them.
        I was so fucking confused when it said that. I ended up catching one though she's pretty powerful. My wife has a lot to say about it everytime she pops up on screen tho haha
            My friend caught one with multiple bonuses to work speed and all he could say was '.... sigh. She's 'very good with her hands''.
    warning  there is hot pals in your area.
    I WILL DEFEND MY VIRGINITY WITH MY LIFE.
    Whole new meaning to 'hot singles in your area'.
I'm not gonna lie, after ready the entry, those things running to me will never stop being scary.

That huge things with massive teeth that wants to rip my arm off? No problem.

Pink Nicky Minaj Dinosaur? Hell fucking no.
    A friend called them Goofy Minaj and it seems pretty accurate.
    My personal name for pal 69 is Jar Jar Pinks
    Pink Nicky Minaj Dinosaur that'll yiff you every night if it gets ahold of you with or without your approval.

I can't think of a worse nightmare for furry-haters.
You can sleep even in the raid btw, just sleep and take the raid on when it is morning.
    This is super helpful information. So like just goto bed as they approach?
        Yea, it will just pause the raid and resume in the morning, when your palkemon is more awake.
            Lol @ Palkemon. I'm stealing it just FYI. And thanks for the knowledge, I hadn't even thought of that.
            That's polite of them
                Professionals have standard
                palite
Man got Snu Snu‚Äôd
    Psh more like gang snu snu'd.
        Even better!
They're actually extremely useful. I've caught like 6 of them for menial chores lol¬†
I built my base on top of this mountain next to a bunch of metal deposits, and now every time a raid shows up, they spawn at the bottom of this cliff and can't reach anything that I built. It's kinda amusing watching them run around in circles before despawning, but I do hope they give them some sort of way to get up cliffs in a future update.
*Hot single girls in your area wanting to fuck*
That‚Äôs number 420. Number 42 is just the answer.
    420 had better be a grass/fire type...
        Also a dog that resembles a certain Peanuts character instead of a pokemon.
            Oh, I get it. Because people smoked a loot of weed at Woodstock, right?
                I assume it's more about Snoopy being close to Snoop, who smokes a lot of weed.  Because Woodstock is the bird, not the dog.
                    Frankly I just enjoy the fact that both connections are possible to make.
                Fwiw, I thought your Woodstock theory worked pretty well too lol.
            Does he rap?
        350 should be a loch ness monster
            got dang it!! i ain‚Äôt giving no monster no **tree fiddy**!!
    Yes, but what's the question?
        "what do you get when you multiply six by nine?"

  
-a bunch of handmade scrabble tiles randomly chosen from a bag by a time-displaced organic component of the greatest supercomputer of all time, who happened to be revered for his supreme sandwich making abilities
            I've seen a lot of references to Hitchhikers guide but I've never seen anyone make a reference to 'Mostly Harmless' haha awesome stuff
                The later books were actually really compelling but tend to get drowned out of the conversation by all the memorable moments in the first book made famous by the movie(s)
            Ah, I see you are also someone who really knows where their towel is.
        Violence.

It's never the answer
            clever :D but by answering that question thusly you created an instance of it becoming a literal answer, and have further contributed to the total progressive breakdown of spacetime, which I appreciate :)
            Violence is never the answer. It is the question, and the answer is yes
            the answer is always yes
    Watch pal 420 become some rock or flower based plant.
    So long and thanks for all the feeeeesh!
Actually pal 42 was the first Pal to play in the MLB.
There's also pals who [injure knees of people who used to be an adventurer like you](https://i.imgur.com/nlKwoJw.png).
Pal #42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.
More dinosaur looking pals
    Do I have the just the game for you!
        The kid named ARK: Survival
            kid named terribly unoptimized "we don't know how to use more than 1 thread" buggy 300GB mess with wasted potential:
                "oh it's just a 20GB patch wait why is it redownloading everything!?"
                And despite all that, it's still a pretty great game.
                    Only if you're forewarned about how awful the vanilla settings are.

Or if you don't value the commodity known as time.
        Hot New version just dropped even lol
            for ASE or ASA? I havnt touched ASA since it launched due to how desastrous both the game and the shitstorm around the company decisions were. Is it any good now?
                ASA is better if you like the vanilla experience and graphical updates with PVE.  Some good quality of life stuff in there but its not quite where it needs to be yet and still has a ton of bugs.  ASE is probably still going to be the better route for stability and the overall mod availability.
                    Alright so basically nothing has changed yet lol
    There's a zero fucking chance we won't be digging for fossils and have revitalization chambers at some point. And then compression fossil pals for oil so we can power submarines and go collect sea fossils to keep going.
        This is a joke about Ark. Which is the game Palworld is apparently copying more than Pokemon.
            Palworld is basically someone going "What if we made Ark but good?"
                What if we made Ark with more than 15 frames per second?
            I think Studio Wildcard has burned far too many bridges for anyone to argue in their favour lol.
                Them dropping paid DLC/expansion during early access was the beginning of the end.
            They've definitely improved upon the game loop from Ark.  Also much, much less unreal engine jank from what I've seen.
            Or they genuinely want more dinosaur like designs in the game?
    Gamfreaks been giving dinosaur Pok√©mon the shaft for a while too.
        The shaft, you say?
            No, Joker, you can‚Äôt!
        They've been giving me the shaft by turning every cute lil cat into a god damn fursuit
    It IS an Early Acess.

I'm expecting more pals in the future. (awful name, tho. Homophone to cock in portuguese, too, it:s a riot here im Brazil)
    Idk man, a goofy looking electric Dino whooped my ass yesterday lol
* Executing captured human Pals for what's in their pockets.  
* Butchering Pals for meat.

But both of those exist already. What is needed is to:  

* Butcher human Pals for meat.
    I thought you were supposed to use humans for hats, not meat
        r/shitrimworldsays
    I got a game for you then... head on over to /r/rimworld for all your human butchering needs.
        mmmm tasty tasty warcrimes
    I watched a video of a human pal being butchered so can you not collect the meat?
        I don't think human pals drop anything when butchered.
    Donner, party of five?
    Ah, the Conan/Rimworld crossover
Don‚Äôt you have to feed pals cake in order for them to breed too?
    Yes. Lovander also had a chance to drop cake as well.
They'll produce honey if you have a ranch and they work at your base.
Don't worry, Lovander also has "cake" on her because obviously she has a lot of it to go around.
Someone already made a mod that puts Pok√©mon skins on the pal and turns your character into ash. That‚Äôs the kinda shit that‚Äôll get the game into hot water.
    No, that'll get the mod into hot water. ESPECIALLY so b/c in order to get the mod you have to pay for it. That modder is fucked
        I believe the mod is actually taken down now.
            Hope so for his sake. Japan's lack of fair use laws means he couldn't have it anyway, but charging money for it was like throwing gasoline on campfire next to a natural gas facility.
                If an American or Canadian developer makes a mod that violates Japanese laws what legal recourse is there for the Japanese company seeking damages? Could they sue internationally or something?
                    Yes, and from what I hear they are pretty successful in those lawsuits. Nintendos litigation arm is world wide and successful from everything I've read recently. The fact Pocketpair is in Japan and not pursuing this means they probably won't in the future. 

I'm not sure if they go after every Tom Dick or Harry but others have already said that the modder got a Cease and Desist letter.
Who needs mods when the basegame already looks like a junble of mods?
It actually might take a little while this time around. Have to wait for the hentai modders to stop frothing at the mouth first.
Yesterday I forced 4 pals into a giant fruit compressor, transformed them all into a smoothie, and made their best bud drink it, and lied to him saying his friends "nobly" sacrificed themselves.


Game is fucked man. It's the most fucked up game without blood I've ever played. I was explaining all the fucked up things you can do in the game to my girlfriend and she couldn't believe it she thought it was basically a pokemon Fascism simulator
    Yesterday I forced a pengullet to build the cleaver I used to kill it
        Like forcing a murder victim to dig their own grave, Jesus Christ...
            I did that exact same thing yesterday with a different Pokemon, but did it in front of all the other pals to set an example as to why you don't start slacking off.

And I'm just saying, they mostly stopped what they were doing and looked at the execution. And they've been great since. So I guess it worked
                I feel like I'm in a crusader Kings thread
                    Average CK3 thread:

"How to get cucked by my wife, cuck her back and kill her?"

"I want to do eugenics, what stats I should max out on? Should they get the extra long chin trait of an Hapsburg?"

"Where genocide button? I want to kill all those dwarfs!"

"Can I put the bishop up my ass..." (wait, that's r/AnarchyChess)
                        My brother killed my dog so I tried to execute him but failed and started a civil war where in I captured his gay lover who I then made into the anti-pope after killing my brother in combat and turning his wife and our sister into concubines.
                        Sounds a bit like /r/Bannerlord - "My wife is pregnant; what happens if I kill her in the tourney?"
                So this game is Pokemon, but you're King Leopold II of Belgium.
            I have only played for a few hours but I was laughing when I had a pal hatch from an egg and immediately sent him to build his own bed.
    But, it's still fun.
        It's a better Pok√©mon game than Pok√©mon Scarlet tbh

This game wouldn't have done the numbers it's done if Pok√©mon wasn't shitting out half assed beta builds and actually made a game worthy of the title, hopefully this has made some waves within Nintendo, but I doubt it
            It's not a better pokemon game that Scarlet, it's not a Pokemon game. Plays nothing like it.

Is it a better game than Scarlet/Violet? Fuckin absolutely. But saying it's a better pokemon game is disingenuous. They aren't similar.
                Plus, people ignoring the Legends Arceus which should‚Äôve been it‚Äôs comparison. Even then, it‚Äôs not a survival game
            Oh they see what happens and honestly, if they don't evolve pokemon they will loose money and that's the last thing they want. Last part I played was perl but I saw the open world part and it was the same? Almost No innovation. But now....
                The Pokemon games make the least revenue of any of their Pokemon products, they aren't worried. If toy sales dropped, then they would be concerned
                    Also, it's not like pokemon games will stop selling. They sell like fucking crazy even as half assed releases. It's not like people are going to just stop buying pokemon because Palworld exists. Believe it or not people will buy the next pokemon game after having bought palworld.

Its not like Palworld is some revolution in gaming, it's just the game of the moment. 90% of people hoping pokemon crashes and burns because of Palworld will buy the next trash pokemon releases.
                        Or maybe people should hope GameFreak and Nintendo simply builds more on the Legends series they started, which is the closest thing to PalWorld, instead of continuously comparing it to the core series masters release of Scarlett and Violet
                    TBF they all fuel each other. So a drop in game sales would lead to a drop in licensed merch.
                        Yes, this is like saying it doesn't matter how many people see the next Star Wars or Marvel film, the real money is in merch. Nobody is going to buy Iron Man armor 752 from Hot Toys for $700 if the movie that it's in bombs.
                    According to Wikipedia, around 92% of their revenue comes from merchandices, versus 7% from the games.

They really don't need to improve their game to make money. They just need to make new cool and cute creatures.
                *lose
            >Pok√©mon Scarlet tbh

i mean, it's a completely different game lol. Comparing the two genres is kinda pointless.
            It‚Äôs gamefreak/the Pok√©mon company. Nintendo really doesn‚Äôt have that much control over the ip, they‚Äôre just the publisher. I doubt they‚Äôll step in as long as Pokemon is making money hand over fist. they have to be aware that the recent games are getting a lot of negative attention but until that attention leads to actual consequences then they‚Äôre not gonna care
    it makes sense. the developers cited rimworld as an inspiration for the game.... makes sense....
        Yeah, I'm reading that comment and thinking that is straight up Rimworld. Where I forced a husband to kill his wife and then eat her so he could survive.
    >I forced 4 pals into a giant fruit compressor, transformed them all into a smoothie, and made their best bud drink it, and lied to him saying his friends "nobly" sacrificed themselves.

I ask this sincerely:

Why do you ***want*** to do that????
        It makes the one Pal stronger. 4, 8, 16, then 64. 116 Pals fed into one, to make it 4 star.
            I understand the concept of power-ups so it's nice that it actually accomplishes something but this person seems to be taking particular  delight in feeding them *their friends* and then *lying to them about it*. 

Why so they WANT to do that?
                It was probably added to have an alternative to just whacking them for food. If you breed for stats the amount of pals you generate is actually ridiculous and you quickly run out of room.
            How much stronger do they get when you go up in stars?
                They get 1 star stronger every star they go up
                    I guess I meant more in terms of their power/strength. Like if a 0 star pokemon has 100 attack, what does a 2 star pokemon have?
                        It‚Äôs maybe a 5-10% increase to the stats, but more importantly it increases the level of their ability. ¬†Example, better chicken gives more eggs or a mounted pal gets slightly faster. ¬†I will say the buffs to the abilities are way mor noticeable than the stats.
                        There is marginal stat boosts to the core stats like HP/Defense/Attack however all Pals have a "Trait" of some sort, most are passive, like if its rideable or usable as a glider. Increase the star/rank of the Pal upgrades that trait. So Direhowls (wolf) get faster when mounted. Lunaris increases your carry weight more, Daedreams do more damage when out etc etc. I'm assuming the farmable pals would increase drop rate/frequency in the base.
        Right? ‚ÄúThis game is so fucked up, it lets me do the stuff I desire. So fucked up!‚Äù
        By fusing the Pals you increase a Pal from 0 stars to 1 star. It increases their stats and levels up their partner skill. 

I have a 3 star Chicken, I've fed him 52 chickens in the blender. All so that he lays more eggs.
        because I wanted to combine the movie Madagascar and Highlander into a single video game.
    Well, she's not wrong.
    The most inhumane games have the word "world" in it.

Coincidence? I think not
        Looking at you, Rimworld
            Or the worst of all, real world.
        World of Tanks in shambles
    This comment made me decide to buy the game
        Best marketing campaign to sell me on the game.
            the product markets itself has never been truer
            I've never played a single Pokemon game and never wanted to, but damn if I don't want to try Palworld out at this point...
        It did the opposite for me.  Which I think makes this one of the best straight up game reviews I've ever seen?  It *actually tells you* in a single sentence if you'll want the game or not.  That's impressive.
    Oh, hi Cartman. Decided to make a smoothie instead of chili sauce this time?¬†
    It honestly feels like someone got touched in the wrong way by Scott Ramsoomair's [Super Effective](https://vgcats.com/SE/?strip_id=0) when they were little.

        In lore they actually enjoy battling, so it's more like you're a boxing trainer than a boxer trainer.
    This is just the level process from Pok√©mon go.
Where for the longest time the only way to level up a Pok√©mon was to mush up his brother's and make them into candy
    Pokemon meets Happy Tree Friends.
    It's Pokemon meets Rimworld meets Ark.

And I'm here for it. Because let's be real, the Pokemon world is totally full of this stuff. Heck, some of the mangas even delve into it with Pokemon getting permanently injured or brutally killed.
    Dude, make a butcher's cleaver and butcher your pal. Its already pixelated in game XD
    Man, im just trying to live in peace with my pals and y‚Äôall over here playing rimworld with them.
    I just unlocked thr cleaver. I have yet to use it, but when that day comes... I'll never be the same.
    Yeah, it's great. The pixellation blur while you savagely butcher your captured pals made me laugh and shake my head in dismay at the same time.
    What. The. Fuck.
        Its worth noting that all of this is a "creative interpretation" if what happens. 
None of this is depicted. You go up to a science machine with no animations, open a menu and pick a few mons from a box. Thats it. It is funny to describe because the game isnt actually showing you anything fucked up.

Its like when people describe some incredibly fucked thing they did in Dwarf fortress or Rimworld. It becomes funny when none of the cruelty is depicted and everything just "technically" happened
            A cruelty occurring onscreen is just gore, one occurring off screen is horror.
    lol sounds like cult of the lamb
    >she couldn't believe it she thought it was basically a pokemon Fascism simulator

is she wrong tho
    I was playing it with a friend on discord when another friend joined in, after listening to us talk for like 10 minutes about stuff like monkey pal special ability being a fucking AK47 he pulls out and starts blazing he asked if we are just fucking with him or are all those things actually in the game
    "Pok√©mon Fascism Simulator" lmao I never thought I'd see this word combination.
I don't get why people keep pretending they're even the same genre of game.
    The only gameplay aspect that's remotely Pokemon-like is the way you throw balls to catch the creatures.

Combat, crafting, progression, base building, exploration, multiplayer, etc. are all just a more casual/less grindy version of Ark.
    Yeah it‚Äôs not even remotely similar to Pokemon. It‚Äôs reskinned Ark.
        Its reskinned Ark. The reskin makes it look like Pokemon. The Pokemon comparison isn't going anywhere since they literally copied the art style for their monsters.
        Except it's third person, so it's better.
"Palworld does what Nintendon't"
Pokemon , but with rule 34 build in.
"Pokemon but that vaporeon meme you heard one time is real"
Let‚Äôs revive the old Sega slogan, palworld does what Nintendon‚Äôt
Honestly, I've been wanting a mature Pok√©mon game for ages.
Won't let you but are done in the pokemon world, all of it, there is enough evidence to support pokemons being food and also romantic parters to humans throughout the manga xD
    \>No animals exist, only Pokemon.

\>Characters eat meat.

Where does the meat come from Nintendo?
Including using guns
Pokemon: nooo we can't have the kids gambling, no more game corner


Palworld:
For decades people have been making jokes about walking up to a Pokemon and just punching it, shooting Pokemon with a gun instead of battling them, Pokemon dying from another Pokemon's ridiculously strong attack, or where the meat in the Pokemon world comes from. This is just the result.
Literally. I haven't been able to steal pok√©mon since the Gamecube games and those were my favourite ones. Now I can steal the pals, and the trainers, and I can force them to make me more capturing devices.
I hate that you've reminded me about this.
    Did you know‚Ä¶
        Yes Officer, this comment here
        [Joe Biden knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSn3QqJq1wQ)
            Oh my god this is amazing.  This is what AI is for.
            What's interesting to me is that the AI can't seem to replicate his stutter. Biden has dealt with that his whole life, but its never replicated in these models
                I feel like Biden wouldn't stutter in this instance, because he's practiced this speech a thousand times.
                If movies like the King's Speech are to be believed, stutterers frequently do not stutter when they are expressing something they are extremely emotional about, so it checks out here.
            What a world we live in.

Now I want to see a Trump one with his trademark incoherent rambling.
                Well, I don't have any kind of ai that can do it for you... maybe ElevenLabs? But I will try my best to provide text "worthy" of Trump:

Hey guys, did you know that... in terms of male human, and I know what a male human is, and you know what a male human is, but... not a female human, but a male human.... one that has a... you know.. one that has a... My father was a male and a human, and he told me when I was a kid... my father, Ted Trump, got very wealthy because of the male human, but if you think about male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, and I know you have. Who hasn't? The democrats, probably. They don't have the mind - the brains - to think about something complex like... they're too busy trying to define a male human to even think about breeding one. But if you think about a female Pok√©mon - as I have many times - if you think about one... you know, I met with Satoshi Tajiri, and we talked about Pok√©mon, and he told me, he said, "Ronald," that's what he calls me, Ronald, because they don't do their d's like... they don't do their d's. The Japanese. Very smart. Very smart people. Can't do their d's. He said, "Ronald, you know more about Pok√©mon than anyone at Nintendo. More than me. More than even Nintendo himself." So when I talk about Pok√©mon, you know that what I say is right and true. And when you take into account my father - went to Richmond Hill High School, by the way - and you take into account his knowledge of the male human, and you know that my knowledge - my extensive knowledge - of Pok√©mon, you have to know that Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans. It's true. It is. I wouldn't lie to you. It's Vaporeon. Not only are they in the field egg group, which is the best group, by the way, the only group that has eggs, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. That's big. It's not yuge, but it's big. It's bigger than... it's bigger than all the Pok√©mon that are smaller. The smaller Pok√©mon, they're called that, because they're a bit on the small side. The Vaporeon though, big. Bigly Pok√©mon. But what that means, is this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks. I know. I know. I know what you're thinking, but it's true. It's true. I went to Wharton, you know? It's true. Vaporeon can handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats - not as impressive as me, but impressive - their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Acid Armor, by the way doesn't mean it's made of acid. It means.. you know what it means. It's not... it's not real armor that you can wear. I mean, I can wear it. I can. It's true. It's... I've been known to wear some acid armor from time to time. 

But Vaporeon, due to their mostly water based biology there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet. I've seen Vaporeon before, not in real life, of course, but I've studied the models. I've studied... you know... they put the... these guys and their computers, it's so crazy what they can do now. So many people... I've seen'em. So many people would look at these guys on their computers, and their making with the ai - the artificial intelligence - the... computer brains... they just... They've got these computers, and I've seen'em and seen what they can do, and they showed me, and I understood it. I saw the models, and I knew.. I was asking questions, and they said, "Mr. Trump you know computers?" I said, "Sure I know computers. I'm not just a president, you know. I'm a... I use... you all have seen how much I'm on the computer. I know'em. I know computers. I almost became a programmer when I was in Wharton. I didn't. I decided to become rich instead. Not that programmers can't get rich. They can. You know... STEM... that's a.. they've gotta get more women in STEM. I can fix that. These Democrats, they talk about women and women's right, and they don't even know what a woman is, but I know. You all know that I know what a woman is. If there's anyone that knows what a woman is, it's me. Ha ha ha You know that. I know that.... the women... that's right... they all know that. So I... I see the models, these Vaporeon models, and I see'em, and I know them too, and these computer guys, they show'em to me, and I say to them, "That's a water based Pok√©mon. It's gotta be wet," and they say, "That's right. It is too!" And I see the models, and it's so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. I know that might sound crazy, but it's true. It's true. I've seen the models.

And they can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip. Now, these moves, they don't work on me, but for others, these moves, they would work on them. Along with that, they don't have fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. And who doesn't like being in the mood? With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue, and I tell ya... I tell ya... they would.. if it was me... they would be fatigued. But they can recover from that... that fatigue... with enough water. And I have water. The best water money can buy. It's the BEST water. I wish you could all taste the water I have. It's the best water. So I could use that best water with my Vaporeon, but even then... you don't NEED the best water. No. Vaporeon doesn't need it. But mine would have it.

No other Pok√©mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white.
                    I swear his voice clicked into the narration two sentences in.

They may raid your base at some point
    I'll welcome them with open arms
        Sounds great until they kill all your pets and level your base
            Kinky
            Even with just mainly basic shit at the base, it's been harder for me to catch anything that raids. 

They seem to die too quickly
                I'm kinda okay with it since I seem to get raids every 20-25 minutes if I'm hanging out at the base lol.  Kind of annoying I basically need to be AWAY from all my work stations and base as a whole otherwise the game seems to detect me step close in proximity and just laughs and says RAID TIME BITCH.
                    ...sooo...The Forest, with Pokemon?
                Surround your base with enough traps that is outside of your ~~Slaves~~ Pals alarm raidus.  LOL
                    I tried that. But had to constantly reset the traps because I kept getting chickens, cats, and sheep. Lol. Then got annoyed enough that I just said screw it.
        Might as well with wide open legs
        Death by snu snu
    That's how I got her and Swee.
 
Now I run a brothel out of out of the ruins of a cathedral.
        what
            Well, you see... When two pals love each other dearly...
 
They play monopoly!
 
That way they can tell just how good they are at getting screwed by the other.
                and If we Play Catan, we can see how into rough stuff they are.

[deleted]
    Oh I've seen the description...thats a main reason I want one.
I have 10 aiming for the 126 it takes to feed a bunch to their friends for the ultimate deviant.
They spawn in the desert area near Anubis at night
that's the neat part, you don't... they catch you (Ôªø Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I'm gonna go build my own Pok√©mon, with blackjack and hookers!
Truly, humanity will be doomed by its own horniness.


That being said... I'd hit it.
When you make a world, you can set exp rate, harvest rate, spawn rate, etc to extraordinary levels so there‚Äôs virtually no grind!
    Not to mention the base rate is insanely generous with how much you get for the first 10 captures.

if you want to get exp you can reliably gain multiple levels in like 30 minutes of just messing around
    It's really only a few times where the slow contruction rate feels grindy, but overall pretty fun. 

Me Personally? I'm playing the hell out of the new prince of persia right now. But I'm a huge sucker for SWAGGY metroidvanias, even if they are from ubi :(
        [deleted]
            [deleted]
It's really not a huge grind, even standard rate is pretty quick. Make sure to level carry capacity over anything else
    prioritize carry capacity. 

at most, 1000 base hp maximum.

then stamina to a comfortable level (personal preference).

*edited and reworded to make more sense.*
        Yeah agreed on this. Being able to efficiently capture a ton of pals will help you level up faster (HP and stamina). Just be sure to build your first base on a spot with some resources (at least a couple ore veins and trees)
        Really? I'm over level 20 I have only put one point in health and I kinda wish I put it somewhere else
    FYI there's a few pals who will boost your carry capacity in your team, and generally are strong world bosses so are decent team members. If you can catch a few of them, you can condense them to power up just one of them and make their special ability (carry capacity) more powerful (presumably, I've only boosted the speed of my mounts so far). You'd probably need to breed them to get enough to condense though.
    I feel its better to focus on HP and stamina because you can always take Pals that increase your carry capacity when you need to go harvesting.  You can also use the Pal condenser to increase their bonus carrying capacity.
There's a sort of grind, but the Pals can harvest resources for you.  It's like if your Anky, Dodic, and Beaver harvested resources while Dodos carried everything back to your storage boxes.  

When crafting, materials are pulled from all boxes within your base, too - like S+ from ASE - so you don't have to hold all the mats to craft things.
    God this is such a nice QoL change for survival games. Not having to have the mats on me to make shit is amazing.
I've played for a bit it's not really grindy...you can let your slav- I mean poke- I mean pals grind for you
    Heh... there's literally nothing to do in the game outside of grinding. Your goals are :

* Beat the towers (level 10/20/30/40/50), which requires a high level with good pals.
* Raise your level, which requires killing/capturing a *bunch* of pals.
* Complete the paldex, which requires capturing/breeding/hatching 10 of each specis.
* Get better pals, either through 1/9000 capture chances, or a shitton of breeding.
* Level up your base, by gathering *hundreds* of materials to build the next tier of building, with only the first tier of materials being natively automated (stone/wood), outside of a few exception (couple of pals can be ranched for mats).

It's definitely a fun grind (imo, to each their own), but it's literally only a grinding game.
        I find it laughable how people are calling this the Pokemon killer when their gameplay, besides catching creatures using balls, are not even close in similarity.
This game has been on development for near 3 years and Nintendo would have been very aware of it. Maybe the developers say f it and bail with the money but I doubt that would happen.¬†


Now paid pokemon mods, those will get shut down.¬†
    Apparently the devs went on record stating they had multiple legal teams scour the game for any IP infringement and came away clean. Doesn't mean they couldn't still get sued, but they are confident they would win if they did.
I don't like Pokemon games, they've just always bored me, but I've been digging Palworld. It's on Gamepass though, wouldn't have bought it otherwise.

None of my friends play games but I bet that's a good time in palworld
1st, I wouldn't worry about it getting a C&D.  There's no way Nintendo didn't know about this game during it's development and, if they had smelled blood in the water, they would have killed it long ago.  NAL, but with how litigious Nintendo is it only makes sense.  


2nd, it is basically Ark but w/ Pals (pokemon) instead of Dinosaurs.  The big difference here is that as you catch Pals and level up, you get to automate the more monotonous parts of the game.  For instance, my Fiance and I have a base that is constantly generating the resources we need to build the fun things to keep going out and catching Pals and changing our home design to fit the new stuff we've unlocked.  


Also, when you make a game, you can choose "Custom Settings" to customize exp gain, harvest rate, work rate, spawn rate, etc etc etc to your liking.  So if you really want to just unlock stuff fast and have fun catching pals WITHOUT the survival crafting part impacting your gameplay much, you can!
Nintendo doesn't give two shits about Palworld. Their only statement was literally "we're aware the game exists please shut the hell up and stop emailing us"


You can change the rates of your world. Higher catch rate, take less damage, do more damage, gather resources significantly faster, lessen hunger, disable raids, etc etc.¬†


Highly recommended. It's extremely fun and perfectly casual friendly.¬†
I ended up refunding it. I didn't like the feel of the game I guess. There was no battle system like in the Pok√©mon games. I wanted to do battle with the other Pok√©mon (Pals) that I caught. And the crafting took forever... having to hold down x for over a minute to craft a few items is a stupid way to extend the grind of a game. A single button press should suffice. Or even just like, 5 seconds. I was literally holding the button for over 60 seconds, since each item took like 6 to complete and I wanted to make a bunch.

I just wasn't having fun. Maybe your mileage will vary, maybe I was playing it wrong. It felt confusing to me.
Its the same early access survival crafting shit as 100 other games. With pokemon thrown in.
You get exp boost for catching 10 of the same pal. I think there is also a slider to control how much exp you want your save file to give, in its difficulty settings.
If your smart and efficient on what poke.. I mean pals you assign to work at your base you level up quickly and don‚Äôt spend a lot of time gathering resources.

Also, it‚Äôs on game pass. Microsoft wouldn‚Äôt have allowed this game of this nature to go onto game pass without looking into potential copyright infringement issues.
Just turn up the sliders, higher XP, more drops. Etc
If Dicktendo could shut this down they'd already done so, it has to be an 1:1 copy for them to win. Also this game has been in dev since ages long before AI was used this often.
It is exactly that - dumb fun.  It's also surprisingly good though, not just a gimmick game.  If you're into those sort of games of course.
None of the people complaining about it have played ark
My exact reaction to the trailer was that it looked like ARK with pokemon.

And I didn't think there was anything wrong with that.
    Oh I shamelessly love ARK, flaws and all. I just think it's funny that the immediate comparison is to Pokemon
Drama maybe working for them as form of advertising for the game.
Nice.
You Are Nitpicking and Biased, I Win, Bye Bye
Idk if Dunkey is being sarcastic on his review, or he legitimately played the game in the most boring way.

He made a stone pit and a logging facility but didn't use it and instead mined the materials like a noob.
Not yet unfortunately

I mean fortunately. Fortunately you cannot do that. Why would you want to
    I give it a month and there will be a porn mod, Im fucking calling it, I'm betting my left testicle on it

Remindme! 1 month

edit, i get to keep my left testicle
        There's already a nudity mod for thr player character
            I mean nude mods aren't technically porn mods, nice try attempting to steal my left testicle off the bet
                Damn! I really need a replacement...
                    I just want another one. Three ball blues.
                    Your chin will be fine
                I mean, back in my day nudie mags were porn. 

God i'm old.
        And they miss one if they don't call it: Pal Porn with the Porn Pal. And you can donate with PayPal.
        I guarantee you it was done before the game was even released.
            Inside job
        If that. Those Loverslab folks are *quick*.
        Just wait and there will be a harem version that replaces all the pals with random anime waifus.
            A downgrade
    Just wait for the mods
    Yet.
    Freudian slip, huh.
    Can't spell bestiality without best.
Only implied in the deck description of that pal. You gotta wait for the modding scene to start
    I wonder if at some point we'll be able to make brothels
        110%

I have a feeling this mod community is going to turn it up to GTA levels of debauchery. I‚Äôm so here for it, but I also fully expect it to result in controversy when it gets that far
Only if you like to watch by throwing human and Pal in the breeding ranch.
    I didn't think of doing that. I feel like it's good that I didn't think of that.
No, but you can hold hands with her, which is worse.
Nah, thats breeders of the nephylim.
Definitely shows a huge interest in monster catching games. People want a more advanced ‚ÄúPokemon‚Äù game. Palworld literally hits all the things I would wish Pokemon would do.
    There has been other monster catching games in the past, most of them are Pokemon-like. Palmon helped catch people who are into monster catching, but are not looking for a Pokemon-like.

Monster Hunter for instance has it's own Pokemon styled game, but it would be crazy if you kept the combat of Monster Hunter, but included a way to tame the monsters to fight with you.  They almost have something like that in Rise, but is definitly not built to be played in a way like Palworld is.
        The problem with other ‚Äúmonster catching‚Äù game and the reason why none of them have even gotten a fragment of Pok√©mon‚Äôs impact (with exception of SMT/Persona which carved it‚Äôs own niche) is because they all focus on the turn-based battle aspect with Type strengths/weaknesses which Pok√©mon already mastered, making them all just ‚ÄúPok√©mon you play while waiting for the next real Pok√©mon game‚Äù
Palworld instead focuses on the idea of you SURVIVING and eventually thriving in this world. It‚Äôs what got to many people hyped for PLA in the first place (the idea of you sneaking under the tall grass stalking Pok√©mon while you could be attacked by a wild Pok√©mon without realising). This is a real alternative to the Monster Catching genre which none of Pok√©mon‚Äôs current supposed competitors offer
    Persona is technically a monster-catching game - it has guns too!
        It's also a fucking chore 'catching' monsters in it.
            "Look Beelzebub, I just want to talk."
        Yeah, but Persona's gimmick is that it's like 90% of the same monsters every game.
    Everybody is just sleeping too much on Monster Girl Quest Paradox. 

What everybody really wants is for *all* monsters to be fuckable.
    I've never desired to make my pokemon do manual labor in slave like conditions or shove my pokemon into a blender and feed it to the others, but to each their own I guess...
    I grew up loving Pokemon but it doesn't seem like anything about those games has significantly changed in nearly 30 years, if anything, they've gotten worse quality wise. I don't know if that's because Game Freak just doesn't know how to do a 3d game well, if the Switch hardware is hamstringing them, or a combination.

It's the sort of franchise that seems to be happy delivering roughly the same experience to the new generation coming up than it does maintaining interest with people as their tastes change. I can't really blame them, either, it's not like the market has told them anything different with how those games continue to sell amd Nintendo is apparently comfortable not attempting to chase a wider market.
    > Palworld literally hits all the things I would wish Pokemon would do.

Pokemon cannibalism?
Anyone remember temtem?
    TemTem lost much of its initial appeal by going the GAAS/MMO route
        Not even that.  If they had done an MMO style game with actual MMO style updates it probably would be fine.  Instead, the devs said they aren't releasing expansions, aren't releasing new Tems, and don't plan on doing much patching at all.  You basically have all the downsides of an MMO with literally no upside.
        Yeah, Man. I have it for  the steam deck and every time i've tried to play it, the Always Online thing is such a pain in the butt.
    That was the devs shooting themselves in the foot deliberately + greed more than anything, unless palworld devs are lobotomized they have a real chance of sticking
        I thought the drop off was the devs saying ‚Äúgames done, no new tems. No dlc or expansions‚Äù.
            Yeah that's what I was referring to when I said shooting themselves in the foot, should have specified mb

As for the greed bit, I was told some in game prices were inflated with 'longevity' or some other BS as the reason
                Didn't they go crazy with cosmetics and stuff? Just from reading steam reviews.
                Ah. I never played it. Didn‚Äôt realize it had a micro transaction shop.
            The "screw you, we got ours" approach.
    I was hopeful for Temtem but honestly it just kind of sucked. 

It failed to have features Pokemon had since the very first gameboy game, like battle speed options. Every single battle is a slog because the combat is slow and any time an ability triggers the game pauses to tell you about it even if it's an ability that triggers constantly like "fire type moves do +10% damage". The map design isn't awful, but the placement of NPCs is. Windward Fort has the sort of design where wild pokemon spawn everywhere inside every few steps you take like Pokemon Caves, and they still jam-packed the place with 14 unskippable NPC battles and some skippable ones too. It's miserable, there are rooms you enter where you can see the exit but there's a congo line of 5 or 6 people just hanging out blocking the path. There's one room where you have to fight the NPCS "Overconfident Belsoto, Conceited Belsoto, Reckless Belsoto, Foolish Belsoto, and Undeceived Belsoto" one at a time in a forced hallway, while the random battles still spawn in too, and I recall this room because by NPC 4 I was like "this is such a time waster, do I even want to keep playing". FreeTem! as a system expects you to catch and release 50-400 creatures every week to get middling rewards, and this is a massive time sink because of how long battles take with no battle speed option. 


Temtem also added things that purely made the experience worse. Forced online and forced to see other players in the world constantly. This wouldn't be so bad, but the game is not optimized well and even on a really good PC I lag every time I go to an area that is important (like the towns) because the game has to load tons of people and their follower creatures in. The reason they force this at all is because the game is filled to the brim with microtransactions and part of the "value" of spending money on them is that you get to hold other players hostage and force them to see whatever silly hat you bought. I love buying clothes in the Pokemon games because it doesn't cost real money and there's no trouble from it, but Temtem does stuff like make changing item color use up expensive single use consumable items so they can keep getting you to spend on more of them, a far worse system only so they can squeeze money out of people. There are tons of systems designed to annoy you and advertise to you, like the classic battlepass where you get scraps for free and have to scroll past all the actually decent stuff you "earned" but can't have without paying for the pass, and a rotating shop of purchasable items where something like 5/6 are premium currency only and they put 1 mediocre item that can be bought with in-game currency at the very end of the list to force you to scroll past the paid stuff just to find out it's the same chair you have for free just painted a different shade of brown.

Temtem is not a game trying it's best to be a Pokemon killer, it's trying to squeeze money out of people and waste their time. The very first black and white pokemon games did a better job of respecting player time and giving a game that is enjoyable.
    God the NPC's in that game are ugly
    RemindMe! 6 months
I give it like 3-4 months
People will forget about it in 2 months, just like every other fad game
I didn't think to compare it with conan exiles yet but yeah I suppose a case can be made for it. I definatly would call it an ark meets pokemon game. It has an engram system like ark. It has pals which basically is pokemon which u catch by bringing their hp low and throw a ball at them. U got shinies, elements etc. It's fun.
A game similar to ark is automatically going to be similar to Conan to be fair. Wildcard recycled a lot of code between them.
Palworld is more Pokeark.
    Palword is literally Craftopia (PocketPair's last game, that's still in EA 4+ years) evolved.

To which Craftopia was a Zelda/Pokemon etc. rip-off.
        Good god playing that game blind knowing nothing going in was a WILD ride. 

"Oh hey they got the glide thing from Zelda......oh hey they got a straight up deku nut from Zelda.....wait, is that a tank? And a machine gun???" 

It's like the developers were like "oh hey I like this thing" and tossed whatever they could.
Its literally ARK but the creatures do more than just stand still on the base pooping everywhere.
    Moreover, there just isn't poop in the game! At least I think, haven't seen any yet.
It's a survival game with Pokemon. That's really it

I do find the "this is what Pokemon should be" crowd to be pretty amusing, though. If Gamefreak made a game with the mechanics of Palworld everyone who shit on it for not having pretty much any of the staples of a Pokemon game
    Pokemon should 100% not be Palworld. There are aspects it can learn from, but mechanically they should not be the same.
    Didn't Legends Arceus provide a somewhat fresh take on the gameplay and receive a ton of praise? Plus other spin-off games like Mystery Dungeon and Ranger are well-liked.

Pokemon fans are definitely receptive to a change in the formula, but it's far easier for Gamefreak to shit out the formulaic main series games, kids will buy it in droves regardless of quality.
Nah they know what they‚Äôre doing. The entire hype behind the game is based on how similar many elements are to Pokemon
    But when you play the game, you don't encounter those elements. There is no evolving your Pals, or Pal battles (though in their roadmap they want to Pal battles), or badges, etc. The game through and through is a survival game. Like many have said it is way more a "rip-off" of Ark than it is Pokemon. Swap out dinosaurs for monsters and boom that is Palworld. Digimon, Cassette Beasts, TemTem, and many others take way more inspiration from Pokemon than Palworld does.
        This is why I keep looking up info about this game. It doesn't look anything like Pokemon to me and yet everyone swears its what Pokemon should be.

Starting to think the people saying this just don't like Pokemon, at its core, which is fine but like why not just talk about Palworld on its own merits?

Similarly the people trying to bring it down or sending in reports to Nintendo are just fucking weird. Why do we spend so much time do corporation work for them lmfao?
            Agreed for sure. I love Pok√©mon and while it's had its flaw in recent years. People do not (or can not at this point) talk about Palworld without talking about Pok√©mon. Palworld is not what Pok√©mon should or could be aside from graphics, but nobody specifies when they talk about it.

IMO, the more Pok√©mon gets brought up when talking about Palworld, the less Palworld actually compares on its own.
                Yeah I think Palworld can suffer long term if it keeps bringing people in under the assumption it's giving the Pokemon experience.

I also think the edgy tone to the gameplay might lose older players after a while. It's a great hype and streamer game so far like Lethal Company. I'm hoping they can convert that into something that stands on its own but the first step is to escape being derivative of a game not even in the same genre lol.
            >everyone swears its what Pokemon should be.

>Starting to think the people saying this just don't like Pokemon, at its core, which is fine but

THANK YOU for summarizing this. I like Palworld but all the Pokehate is driving me nuts. Pokemon is the goat. No, I'm not buying any of the new games because I'm not dumb, but a cool **turn-based RPG** where you collect the monsters you face and go on an adventure is also fun! And clearly a lot of people like it!

Again, I'm pro-Palworld, but mostly because it's a cheap game from a small studio. Yeah it's fun enough, but I would never want to punch rocks or tolerate this much jank in an actual Pokemon game. If I had to guess, I'd assume an older Pokemon game I never played before like Emerald would be overall more fun.

I want Pokemon to evolve but by making better games, not by switching to the punch rocks genre.
            I would never attempt to replace Pokemon with Palworld. Pokemon is a much more structured RPG experience, and while I think the modern games are pretty terrible, the older games are homeruns in that formula. Palworld is an unstructured, player driven experience that wouldn't fit the Pokemon design at all.

That being said, there are elements of Palworld that Pokemon can learn from. For example, being able to throw out any rideable Pal and actually ride them. In Pokemon, we always had place holder sprites or rental/specific Pokemon we would have to ride. Makes it more immersive if you would actually ride your Pokemon.
            its because palworld does not have its own merits to talk about‚Ä¶ All of its pal designs are copied over from pokemon and edited slightly, its janky and unpolished‚Ä¶ Their previous games are ALSO knockoffs of popular games (Botw and Hollow Knight). You don‚Äôt see this kind of popularity with those, because people in those communities actually have *standards* lol
            It might not play like Pok√©mon, but it very intentionally looks like Pok√©mon. Take the big yellow Pal in this meme. Are you really saying it doesn‚Äôt strongly resemble one specific Pok√©mon?
                It's electric Totoro.

It looks more like Electabuzz than Pikachu if that's what you're implying
                    Electabuzz is the obvious answer
                I am talking from a purely gameplay perspective. You could put any cartoonish animal in front of me and I would on some level think it looks like a Pokemon that's just how brand recognition goes.
        Right but it intentionally has a coat of paint to resemble pokemon right down to the names
        I don't know why people keep saying Digimon. Yeah the name is similar and you have to take care of a "creature" but that's basically where it ends. That goes for the shows, games, and overall theme (except for tbe friendship is magic thing, but all media for children does this). The majority of Digimon games play NOTHING like Pokemon. 

Palworld is definitely closer to Pokemon than Digimon
    That's not even the case, it's has some monster catching mechanics and some related names to pokemon (pokedex, pokeballs etc)  and that's basically it, it's among the other 10 types of game mechanics in the game, Pokemon didn't even "invent" this type of games... cathing monster were a thing way before pokemon. It's like if I added guns to super mario bros and say super mario is a rip off of Call of Duty because both have guns and fps mechanics, makes no sense lol... people are just mad that pokemon didn't make a decent game in years and a random indie studio with 4 guys in a basement did what they would not achieve even if invested billions in it.  
The entire hype of this game is that it got several random game mechanics together to work that most games wouldn't make even 1 work like having guns, crafting, survival, boss fights, base building etc, while most survival games fuck up with crafting or that every other catching monsters game sucks in the last 10 years(including pokemon) even if all they had was 1 job.
Come on man, let‚Äôs not try to blind ourselves.  They very clearly have ripped off countless Pok√©mon.  It‚Äôs fine to call them out for it and still like the game
Man, the Digimon IP would work GREAT as a survival/crafting/capture game. Palworld could be a 1:1 swap with Digimon assets and it wouldn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúwrong‚Äù like a Pok√©mon swap.
"I'm sick and tired of people pointing out the MAIN MARKETING GIMMICK OF THIS GAME!"

Geez, I wonder why they point it out, it couldn't possibly be because of the company blatantly ripping off of Pok√©mon aesthetic in order to sell their product.
Hey don't insult Digimon like that
Ark Survival with pokemon
They will however liscense a huge data harvesting operation utilizing their brand via PokemonGo
Nintendo wouldn't make a game like this, palworld just uses non-pokemon to enhance and further the game, it's more like arc survival then anything.
A commend on dunkey‚Äôs video said something along the lines of ‚Äúit‚Äôs like they shoved every pre-release game into one experience‚Äù and that very much fit the vibe from what I‚Äôve seen of it.
Feels like it‚Äôs target audience are people who hate Nintendo. Haven‚Äôt played it myself but damn the bar seems reaaaaally low.
    Tbf a lot of people hate Nintendo not for petty reasons but because Nintendo has been making shit Pok√©mon games. It‚Äôs a lot easier to accept a potentially lacklustre game from a small studio than to accept a bad game from Nintendo itself.

To have a smaller studio come out with something that rivals the quality of modern Pok√©mon games with very very similar game feel is an easy catch. It‚Äôs the same reason people got so hyped for fan games of Pok√©mon, the quality is so good and it legit rivals modern Pok√©mon content, AND your expectations aren‚Äôt high because it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs game freak.

If you have a Pok√©mon itch that needs scratching, this game can hit it. But at the same time it‚Äôs a twist on the genre. Hell even the line ‚ÄòPok√©mon with guns‚Äô sounds like fun if you like those games. Are there issues with quality and creativity? Yes. If that bothers you don‚Äôt buy it, it‚Äôs expensive for early access imo. But it f you enjoy games of this genre you will at least like this game.
    Ive seen some ppl defend the designs by going ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about nintendo so idc if they plagiarize the pokemon designs‚Äù‚Ä¶, so yeah this is it
It is one of the most successful games on Steam, selling more than 7(?) million copies in a few days and got the second highest concurrent players ever at around 2 million players.

Part of the drama comes from the game's main gimmick: on the surface, it appears to be a cutesy Pokemon like game, but in reality it has a dark/edgy sense of humor where you catch Pals (and humans) and force them to work for you. You can also kill the Pals (unlike Pokemon where they only go unconscious) and there are guns in the game. A similar comparison would be the TV show Happy Tree Friends (look it up at your risk), something that appears to be cute but then turns out to be dark and horrific in ways.

I think the other part of the drama is that people are split on this game: it is wildly successful, that can't be denied, and people will talk about it like it's one of the greatest games ever made. But other people argue that it is basically just another cookie-cutter, bland Early Access survival/crafting asset flip that the devs might just take the money and run and stop updating the game.
Yeah, I tried it the other day just for shits and giggles, and it actually worked. I was shocked
It has already begun.
Noice.
    Noice.
        Noice.
Wonder if any of the Pals can make the penicillin that some of you are gonna need?
    I'd be more interested in the diabetes cure from all that cotton candy for the factory workers
    Luckily enough, lovander's level 2 in medicine production. Also, unrelated, but it has level 2 in handiwork and drops suspicious juice, so take that as you will.
    I mean, making medicine is a skill isn't it?

so probably?
Imagine a true Rimworld/Dwarf Fortress experience where Pal number 69 may have a chance to give you an STD.
bro   be carefull or u will become a furry
    Speaking from experience, I see


Edit: no judging tho :3
    What a horrible tragedy that could be...
Sigh........ [obligatory ](https://youtu.be/CVqsQ-9GLLE?si=3CEMFIpbcNYd0Z5W)
Do cops actually show up at the sanctuary? I saw the constant "criminal activity" message but nothing happened no matter how many Pals I caught/killed in an attempt to catch.
    Yeah kill enough and they'll constantly spawn like 10 level 50s on you
        So what you're saying is that i can have a squad of Cops as Pals?
            Yeah sort of but they're real annoying (along with annoying music). Will spawn on you while flying too lol
                How in the world do you get them to stop pursuing? Only way I can see is to just die
                    > Only way I can see is to just die

That's what my friend and I did ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the internet said you can kill everyone and it'll stop, but they just kept spawning - it seemed impossible to down them all at once before more showed up.  We're also only levels ~15-20, so maybe that's easier as you level up.
                        Don't attack them yourself, you'll get more assault charges and it'll spawn more. Just let your pals take care of them, there might be 1 or 2 waves of respawns but they *will* stop after that. I frequent the no.1 reserve because I'm really trying to get a 4-star Petalia
            They dont fire their weapons after becoming pals. They just do melee attacks. Disappointing.
                You can teach them other moves
                    Did they fix the glitch where they won‚Äôt use those moves, or do they actually work now?
    If one of the guards sees you attacking one of the creatures, you get an alert sound that sounds an awful lot like the, "you committed a crime!" alert sound from Cyberpunk 2077, then a "Wanted!" box shows up in the top right corner, and then the guards start attacking you.
        Huh, there wasn't any cops there when I was. Guess I have to go commit crime again to see if they were just on break.
            From what I've seen

As you start capturing and knocking out pals in the reservation. Guards start taking up those slots more often than pals do.

A reservation will start with like 2 guards and will eventually have 20+ and no more pals.

 Getting spotted means certain death, but the rare pals are worth it.
                >Getting spotted means certain death, but the rare pals are worth it.

This has so much "African rhino poacher vs hardcore rangers" energy, it's making me ponder some major worldbuilding connotations for Palworld.
                Does it reset the # of guards after you die or something?
                    When you get far away enough everything de-spawns and will spawn back in when rendered.

So unless you have a palbox on the reserve (which I haven't tried) everything should repopulate normally.

I've had problems losing lucky pals by getting too far away from them. Once they un-render, pals don't seem to stay.
                Question: can you capture the Guards? Haven't started playing yet, but this sounds like a great way to get a lot of human pals if so...
    I've only crimed once, but it was kinda like GTA stars.  A single assault got the people nearby mad at me.  Once I hit 3, it started spawning level 24s.  At 5 assaults, they were level 30, and at 10 or so I was seeing level 50s.  They spawned in all around me (probably ~3 of them to start, up to 10ish at the peak), even after fast traveling somewhere else
    "Criminal activity" doesn't do anything by itself, but those islands spawn cops. If any cop gets line of sight on you while you have that status, you'll become a wanted criminal for trespassing.¬† And if you attack a cop while another cop can see you, you'll become wanted for assault, as well.


To be clear, "line of sight" for them is a sight cone with some maximum range.¬† You have a little wiggle room.¬† Surprisingly, you can even shoot them from out of range of their sight, and they won't "see" you for criminal purposes until you get close enough.
The fact the Lopunny is completely OK with this in the animation and actually seems happy/excited scares me.
    Lopunny has enough PP that it doesn‚Äôt need to struggle.
        o_o
        Angry upvote.
        There are a few ways to interpret this‚Ä¶
        And it‚Äôs about to get some more PP‚Ä¶
        Not when they have infinite stamina potions
        Holy shit the layers in this comment
    For all we know she thinks joker is just a weird Mr mime
        Mr. Mime and Lopunny are in the same egg group.
            The only group I'd have for Mr. Mime in real life is "kill on sight".
                That's a lot of Pok√©mon to be fair.
                My grouping would be 5.25 inches at 50 yards.
            Mr. Mime (Gotham Form)

Instead of saying 'Mime' or 'Mr. Mime' the Gotham form of Mr. Mime often says strange things about scars and society.
    wait. this is a thing?
        https://youtu.be/VZllAa1odpU?si=YqQnUbSFQn4ecFU4
    Probably thinks Joker is an ugly Mr. Mime.

            I‚Äôve seen this before but it reminded me of how Batman will sometimes hook up with Barbara. Like, yeah they should rethink that.
                > Batman will sometimes hook up with Barbara

Bruce Timm has done great things for Batman, but his weird Bruce/Babs thing always drags him down a bit.
                    Who's the guy who said heros don't perform cunnilingus?
                        Iirc it was D.C. Editorial.

The Harley Quinn cartoon wanted to put in a scene of him going down on Catwoman and D.C. said ‚ÄúNo, we won‚Äôt be able to sell toys of him if he goes down on her.‚Äù
                            I would buy a statue or action figures of Batman going down on Catwoman and I'm not even a comic fan, just a cunnilingus fan
        Oh you¬¥re in for a treat

                I know. Having to go to YouTube to watch videos instead of them being allowed to be embedded? Fuck that.
        Peak
I was kind of confused because it called out Batman, but I definitely read this in Morty's voice.
I just watched the video but before I totally heard this in the "Caaaaarlll that kills people" cadence
I'm washing out my grinder, batman
    NO JOKER THATS THE KIEF
NOOOOOOOO
They use US prison system rules I see
I wonder what constitutes friendly. I caught one of the level 5 guys squatting by a campfire, and nothing seemed to happen.
You spared their lives, they owe you.... so they get to work whatever you darn well tell them
Jonkler catches a lopunny
Actually it‚Äôs ‚Äúcrazed fan girls‚Äù. So basically the same thing.
    I honestly thought npc‚Äôs were coming. I had no idea these things existed before they tore through my camp
    Fangirls that can't contain their love for you.
        Ey there's the way-too-long-name I couldn't remember!
    The raid names seem to change a bit. Mine was "Bandwagon Fan Girls" when we first encountered them.
    I was so fucking confused when it said that. I ended up catching one though she's pretty powerful. My wife has a lot to say about it everytime she pops up on screen tho haha
        My friend caught one with multiple bonuses to work speed and all he could say was '.... sigh. She's 'very good with her hands''.
warning  there is hot pals in your area.
I WILL DEFEND MY VIRGINITY WITH MY LIFE.
Whole new meaning to 'hot singles in your area'.
A friend called them Goofy Minaj and it seems pretty accurate.
My personal name for pal 69 is Jar Jar Pinks
Pink Nicky Minaj Dinosaur that'll yiff you every night if it gets ahold of you with or without your approval.

I can't think of a worse nightmare for furry-haters.
This is super helpful information. So like just goto bed as they approach?
    Yea, it will just pause the raid and resume in the morning, when your palkemon is more awake.
        Lol @ Palkemon. I'm stealing it just FYI. And thanks for the knowledge, I hadn't even thought of that.
        That's polite of them
            Professionals have standard
            palite
Psh more like gang snu snu'd.
    Even better!
420 had better be a grass/fire type...
    Also a dog that resembles a certain Peanuts character instead of a pokemon.
        Oh, I get it. Because people smoked a loot of weed at Woodstock, right?
            I assume it's more about Snoopy being close to Snoop, who smokes a lot of weed.  Because Woodstock is the bird, not the dog.
                Frankly I just enjoy the fact that both connections are possible to make.
            Fwiw, I thought your Woodstock theory worked pretty well too lol.
        Does he rap?
    350 should be a loch ness monster
        got dang it!! i ain‚Äôt giving no monster no **tree fiddy**!!
Yes, but what's the question?
    "what do you get when you multiply six by nine?"

  
-a bunch of handmade scrabble tiles randomly chosen from a bag by a time-displaced organic component of the greatest supercomputer of all time, who happened to be revered for his supreme sandwich making abilities
        I've seen a lot of references to Hitchhikers guide but I've never seen anyone make a reference to 'Mostly Harmless' haha awesome stuff
            The later books were actually really compelling but tend to get drowned out of the conversation by all the memorable moments in the first book made famous by the movie(s)
        Ah, I see you are also someone who really knows where their towel is.
    Violence.

It's never the answer
        clever :D but by answering that question thusly you created an instance of it becoming a literal answer, and have further contributed to the total progressive breakdown of spacetime, which I appreciate :)
        Violence is never the answer. It is the question, and the answer is yes
        the answer is always yes
Watch pal 420 become some rock or flower based plant.
So long and thanks for all the feeeeesh!
Do I have the just the game for you!
    The kid named ARK: Survival
        kid named terribly unoptimized "we don't know how to use more than 1 thread" buggy 300GB mess with wasted potential:
            "oh it's just a 20GB patch wait why is it redownloading everything!?"
            And despite all that, it's still a pretty great game.
                Only if you're forewarned about how awful the vanilla settings are.

Or if you don't value the commodity known as time.
    Hot New version just dropped even lol
        for ASE or ASA? I havnt touched ASA since it launched due to how desastrous both the game and the shitstorm around the company decisions were. Is it any good now?
            ASA is better if you like the vanilla experience and graphical updates with PVE.  Some good quality of life stuff in there but its not quite where it needs to be yet and still has a ton of bugs.  ASE is probably still going to be the better route for stability and the overall mod availability.
                Alright so basically nothing has changed yet lol
There's a zero fucking chance we won't be digging for fossils and have revitalization chambers at some point. And then compression fossil pals for oil so we can power submarines and go collect sea fossils to keep going.
    This is a joke about Ark. Which is the game Palworld is apparently copying more than Pokemon.
        Palworld is basically someone going "What if we made Ark but good?"
            What if we made Ark with more than 15 frames per second?
        I think Studio Wildcard has burned far too many bridges for anyone to argue in their favour lol.
            Them dropping paid DLC/expansion during early access was the beginning of the end.
        They've definitely improved upon the game loop from Ark.  Also much, much less unreal engine jank from what I've seen.
        Or they genuinely want more dinosaur like designs in the game?
Gamfreaks been giving dinosaur Pok√©mon the shaft for a while too.
    The shaft, you say?
        No, Joker, you can‚Äôt!
    They've been giving me the shaft by turning every cute lil cat into a god damn fursuit
It IS an Early Acess.

I'm expecting more pals in the future. (awful name, tho. Homophone to cock in portuguese, too, it:s a riot here im Brazil)
Idk man, a goofy looking electric Dino whooped my ass yesterday lol
I thought you were supposed to use humans for hats, not meat
    r/shitrimworldsays
I got a game for you then... head on over to /r/rimworld for all your human butchering needs.
    mmmm tasty tasty warcrimes
I watched a video of a human pal being butchered so can you not collect the meat?
    I don't think human pals drop anything when butchered.
Donner, party of five?
Ah, the Conan/Rimworld crossover
Yes. Lovander also had a chance to drop cake as well.
No, that'll get the mod into hot water. ESPECIALLY so b/c in order to get the mod you have to pay for it. That modder is fucked
    I believe the mod is actually taken down now.
        Hope so for his sake. Japan's lack of fair use laws means he couldn't have it anyway, but charging money for it was like throwing gasoline on campfire next to a natural gas facility.
            If an American or Canadian developer makes a mod that violates Japanese laws what legal recourse is there for the Japanese company seeking damages? Could they sue internationally or something?
                Yes, and from what I hear they are pretty successful in those lawsuits. Nintendos litigation arm is world wide and successful from everything I've read recently. The fact Pocketpair is in Japan and not pursuing this means they probably won't in the future. 

I'm not sure if they go after every Tom Dick or Harry but others have already said that the modder got a Cease and Desist letter.
Yesterday I forced a pengullet to build the cleaver I used to kill it
    Like forcing a murder victim to dig their own grave, Jesus Christ...
        I did that exact same thing yesterday with a different Pokemon, but did it in front of all the other pals to set an example as to why you don't start slacking off.

And I'm just saying, they mostly stopped what they were doing and looked at the execution. And they've been great since. So I guess it worked
            I feel like I'm in a crusader Kings thread
                Average CK3 thread:

"How to get cucked by my wife, cuck her back and kill her?"

"I want to do eugenics, what stats I should max out on? Should they get the extra long chin trait of an Hapsburg?"

"Where genocide button? I want to kill all those dwarfs!"

"Can I put the bishop up my ass..." (wait, that's r/AnarchyChess)
                    My brother killed my dog so I tried to execute him but failed and started a civil war where in I captured his gay lover who I then made into the anti-pope after killing my brother in combat and turning his wife and our sister into concubines.
                    Sounds a bit like /r/Bannerlord - "My wife is pregnant; what happens if I kill her in the tourney?"
            So this game is Pokemon, but you're King Leopold II of Belgium.
        I have only played for a few hours but I was laughing when I had a pal hatch from an egg and immediately sent him to build his own bed.
But, it's still fun.
    It's a better Pok√©mon game than Pok√©mon Scarlet tbh

This game wouldn't have done the numbers it's done if Pok√©mon wasn't shitting out half assed beta builds and actually made a game worthy of the title, hopefully this has made some waves within Nintendo, but I doubt it
        It's not a better pokemon game that Scarlet, it's not a Pokemon game. Plays nothing like it.

Is it a better game than Scarlet/Violet? Fuckin absolutely. But saying it's a better pokemon game is disingenuous. They aren't similar.
            Plus, people ignoring the Legends Arceus which should‚Äôve been it‚Äôs comparison. Even then, it‚Äôs not a survival game
        Oh they see what happens and honestly, if they don't evolve pokemon they will loose money and that's the last thing they want. Last part I played was perl but I saw the open world part and it was the same? Almost No innovation. But now....
            The Pokemon games make the least revenue of any of their Pokemon products, they aren't worried. If toy sales dropped, then they would be concerned
                Also, it's not like pokemon games will stop selling. They sell like fucking crazy even as half assed releases. It's not like people are going to just stop buying pokemon because Palworld exists. Believe it or not people will buy the next pokemon game after having bought palworld.

Its not like Palworld is some revolution in gaming, it's just the game of the moment. 90% of people hoping pokemon crashes and burns because of Palworld will buy the next trash pokemon releases.
                    Or maybe people should hope GameFreak and Nintendo simply builds more on the Legends series they started, which is the closest thing to PalWorld, instead of continuously comparing it to the core series masters release of Scarlett and Violet
                TBF they all fuel each other. So a drop in game sales would lead to a drop in licensed merch.
                    Yes, this is like saying it doesn't matter how many people see the next Star Wars or Marvel film, the real money is in merch. Nobody is going to buy Iron Man armor 752 from Hot Toys for $700 if the movie that it's in bombs.
                According to Wikipedia, around 92% of their revenue comes from merchandices, versus 7% from the games.

They really don't need to improve their game to make money. They just need to make new cool and cute creatures.
            *lose
        >Pok√©mon Scarlet tbh

i mean, it's a completely different game lol. Comparing the two genres is kinda pointless.
        It‚Äôs gamefreak/the Pok√©mon company. Nintendo really doesn‚Äôt have that much control over the ip, they‚Äôre just the publisher. I doubt they‚Äôll step in as long as Pokemon is making money hand over fist. they have to be aware that the recent games are getting a lot of negative attention but until that attention leads to actual consequences then they‚Äôre not gonna care
it makes sense. the developers cited rimworld as an inspiration for the game.... makes sense....
    Yeah, I'm reading that comment and thinking that is straight up Rimworld. Where I forced a husband to kill his wife and then eat her so he could survive.
>I forced 4 pals into a giant fruit compressor, transformed them all into a smoothie, and made their best bud drink it, and lied to him saying his friends "nobly" sacrificed themselves.

I ask this sincerely:

Why do you ***want*** to do that????
    It makes the one Pal stronger. 4, 8, 16, then 64. 116 Pals fed into one, to make it 4 star.
        I understand the concept of power-ups so it's nice that it actually accomplishes something but this person seems to be taking particular  delight in feeding them *their friends* and then *lying to them about it*. 

Why so they WANT to do that?
            It was probably added to have an alternative to just whacking them for food. If you breed for stats the amount of pals you generate is actually ridiculous and you quickly run out of room.
        How much stronger do they get when you go up in stars?
            They get 1 star stronger every star they go up
                I guess I meant more in terms of their power/strength. Like if a 0 star pokemon has 100 attack, what does a 2 star pokemon have?
                    It‚Äôs maybe a 5-10% increase to the stats, but more importantly it increases the level of their ability. ¬†Example, better chicken gives more eggs or a mounted pal gets slightly faster. ¬†I will say the buffs to the abilities are way mor noticeable than the stats.
                    There is marginal stat boosts to the core stats like HP/Defense/Attack however all Pals have a "Trait" of some sort, most are passive, like if its rideable or usable as a glider. Increase the star/rank of the Pal upgrades that trait. So Direhowls (wolf) get faster when mounted. Lunaris increases your carry weight more, Daedreams do more damage when out etc etc. I'm assuming the farmable pals would increase drop rate/frequency in the base.
    Right? ‚ÄúThis game is so fucked up, it lets me do the stuff I desire. So fucked up!‚Äù
    By fusing the Pals you increase a Pal from 0 stars to 1 star. It increases their stats and levels up their partner skill. 

I have a 3 star Chicken, I've fed him 52 chickens in the blender. All so that he lays more eggs.
    because I wanted to combine the movie Madagascar and Highlander into a single video game.
Well, she's not wrong.
The most inhumane games have the word "world" in it.

Coincidence? I think not
    Looking at you, Rimworld
        Or the worst of all, real world.
    World of Tanks in shambles
This comment made me decide to buy the game
    Best marketing campaign to sell me on the game.
        the product markets itself has never been truer
        I've never played a single Pokemon game and never wanted to, but damn if I don't want to try Palworld out at this point...
    It did the opposite for me.  Which I think makes this one of the best straight up game reviews I've ever seen?  It *actually tells you* in a single sentence if you'll want the game or not.  That's impressive.
Oh, hi Cartman. Decided to make a smoothie instead of chili sauce this time?¬†
It honestly feels like someone got touched in the wrong way by Scott Ramsoomair's [Super Effective](https://vgcats.com/SE/?strip_id=0) when they were little.
[deleted]
    In lore they actually enjoy battling, so it's more like you're a boxing trainer than a boxer trainer.
This is just the level process from Pok√©mon go.
Where for the longest time the only way to level up a Pok√©mon was to mush up his brother's and make them into candy
Pokemon meets Happy Tree Friends.
It's Pokemon meets Rimworld meets Ark.

And I'm here for it. Because let's be real, the Pokemon world is totally full of this stuff. Heck, some of the mangas even delve into it with Pokemon getting permanently injured or brutally killed.
Dude, make a butcher's cleaver and butcher your pal. Its already pixelated in game XD
Man, im just trying to live in peace with my pals and y‚Äôall over here playing rimworld with them.
I just unlocked thr cleaver. I have yet to use it, but when that day comes... I'll never be the same.
Yeah, it's great. The pixellation blur while you savagely butcher your captured pals made me laugh and shake my head in dismay at the same time.
What. The. Fuck.
    Its worth noting that all of this is a "creative interpretation" if what happens. 
None of this is depicted. You go up to a science machine with no animations, open a menu and pick a few mons from a box. Thats it. It is funny to describe because the game isnt actually showing you anything fucked up.

Its like when people describe some incredibly fucked thing they did in Dwarf fortress or Rimworld. It becomes funny when none of the cruelty is depicted and everything just "technically" happened
        A cruelty occurring onscreen is just gore, one occurring off screen is horror.
lol sounds like cult of the lamb
>she couldn't believe it she thought it was basically a pokemon Fascism simulator

is she wrong tho
I was playing it with a friend on discord when another friend joined in, after listening to us talk for like 10 minutes about stuff like monkey pal special ability being a fucking AK47 he pulls out and starts blazing he asked if we are just fucking with him or are all those things actually in the game
"Pok√©mon Fascism Simulator" lmao I never thought I'd see this word combination.
The only gameplay aspect that's remotely Pokemon-like is the way you throw balls to catch the creatures.

Combat, crafting, progression, base building, exploration, multiplayer, etc. are all just a more casual/less grindy version of Ark.
Yeah it‚Äôs not even remotely similar to Pokemon. It‚Äôs reskinned Ark.
    Its reskinned Ark. The reskin makes it look like Pokemon. The Pokemon comparison isn't going anywhere since they literally copied the art style for their monsters.
    Except it's third person, so it's better.
\>No animals exist, only Pokemon.

Where does the meat come from Nintendo?
Did you know‚Ä¶
    Yes Officer, this comment here
    [Joe Biden knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSn3QqJq1wQ)
        Oh my god this is amazing.  This is what AI is for.
        What's interesting to me is that the AI can't seem to replicate his stutter. Biden has dealt with that his whole life, but its never replicated in these models
            I feel like Biden wouldn't stutter in this instance, because he's practiced this speech a thousand times.
            If movies like the King's Speech are to be believed, stutterers frequently do not stutter when they are expressing something they are extremely emotional about, so it checks out here.
        What a world we live in.

Now I want to see a Trump one with his trademark incoherent rambling.
            Well, I don't have any kind of ai that can do it for you... maybe ElevenLabs? But I will try my best to provide text "worthy" of Trump:

Hey guys, did you know that... in terms of male human, and I know what a male human is, and you know what a male human is, but... not a female human, but a male human.... one that has a... you know.. one that has a... My father was a male and a human, and he told me when I was a kid... my father, Ted Trump, got very wealthy because of the male human, but if you think about male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, and I know you have. Who hasn't? The democrats, probably. They don't have the mind - the brains - to think about something complex like... they're too busy trying to define a male human to even think about breeding one. But if you think about a female Pok√©mon - as I have many times - if you think about one... you know, I met with Satoshi Tajiri, and we talked about Pok√©mon, and he told me, he said, "Ronald," that's what he calls me, Ronald, because they don't do their d's like... they don't do their d's. The Japanese. Very smart. Very smart people. Can't do their d's. He said, "Ronald, you know more about Pok√©mon than anyone at Nintendo. More than me. More than even Nintendo himself." So when I talk about Pok√©mon, you know that what I say is right and true. And when you take into account my father - went to Richmond Hill High School, by the way - and you take into account his knowledge of the male human, and you know that my knowledge - my extensive knowledge - of Pok√©mon, you have to know that Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans. It's true. It is. I wouldn't lie to you. It's Vaporeon. Not only are they in the field egg group, which is the best group, by the way, the only group that has eggs, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. That's big. It's not yuge, but it's big. It's bigger than... it's bigger than all the Pok√©mon that are smaller. The smaller Pok√©mon, they're called that, because they're a bit on the small side. The Vaporeon though, big. Bigly Pok√©mon. But what that means, is this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks. I know. I know. I know what you're thinking, but it's true. It's true. I went to Wharton, you know? It's true. Vaporeon can handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats - not as impressive as me, but impressive - their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Acid Armor, by the way doesn't mean it's made of acid. It means.. you know what it means. It's not... it's not real armor that you can wear. I mean, I can wear it. I can. It's true. It's... I've been known to wear some acid armor from time to time. 

But Vaporeon, due to their mostly water based biology there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet. I've seen Vaporeon before, not in real life, of course, but I've studied the models. I've studied... you know... they put the... these guys and their computers, it's so crazy what they can do now. So many people... I've seen'em. So many people would look at these guys on their computers, and their making with the ai - the artificial intelligence - the... computer brains... they just... They've got these computers, and I've seen'em and seen what they can do, and they showed me, and I understood it. I saw the models, and I knew.. I was asking questions, and they said, "Mr. Trump you know computers?" I said, "Sure I know computers. I'm not just a president, you know. I'm a... I use... you all have seen how much I'm on the computer. I know'em. I know computers. I almost became a programmer when I was in Wharton. I didn't. I decided to become rich instead. Not that programmers can't get rich. They can. You know... STEM... that's a.. they've gotta get more women in STEM. I can fix that. These Democrats, they talk about women and women's right, and they don't even know what a woman is, but I know. You all know that I know what a woman is. If there's anyone that knows what a woman is, it's me. Ha ha ha You know that. I know that.... the women... that's right... they all know that. So I... I see the models, these Vaporeon models, and I see'em, and I know them too, and these computer guys, they show'em to me, and I say to them, "That's a water based Pok√©mon. It's gotta be wet," and they say, "That's right. It is too!" And I see the models, and it's so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. I know that might sound crazy, but it's true. It's true. I've seen the models.

And they can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip. Now, these moves, they don't work on me, but for others, these moves, they would work on them. Along with that, they don't have fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. And who doesn't like being in the mood? With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue, and I tell ya... I tell ya... they would.. if it was me... they would be fatigued. But they can recover from that... that fatigue... with enough water. And I have water. The best water money can buy. It's the BEST water. I wish you could all taste the water I have. It's the best water. So I could use that best water with my Vaporeon, but even then... you don't NEED the best water. No. Vaporeon doesn't need it. But mine would have it.

No other Pok√©mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white.
                I swear his voice clicked into the narration two sentences in.
        Oh my god lol
ü§£ sorry
    No you aren't. üòù
https://youtu.be/-EWMgB26bmU?si=qoW_yhOKEv3pHDOz I'm sorry.
    Oh, is this what that whole meme is about? That was hilarious, I expected way grosser.
You don't want to know. One of the most depraved copy pastas in pokemon/gaming history.
    If you do want to know. [Here is Biden talking about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSn3QqJq1wQ)
        Oh my god
[It's something Joe Biden talked about in the Senate one time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSn3QqJq1wQ)
I'll welcome them with open arms
    Sounds great until they kill all your pets and level your base
        Kinky
        Even with just mainly basic shit at the base, it's been harder for me to catch anything that raids. 

They seem to die too quickly
            I'm kinda okay with it since I seem to get raids every 20-25 minutes if I'm hanging out at the base lol.  Kind of annoying I basically need to be AWAY from all my work stations and base as a whole otherwise the game seems to detect me step close in proximity and just laughs and says RAID TIME BITCH.
                ...sooo...The Forest, with Pokemon?
            Surround your base with enough traps that is outside of your ~~Slaves~~ Pals alarm raidus.  LOL
                I tried that. But had to constantly reset the traps because I kept getting chickens, cats, and sheep. Lol. Then got annoyed enough that I just said screw it.
    Might as well with wide open legs
    Death by snu snu
That's how I got her and Swee.
 
Now I run a brothel out of out of the ruins of a cathedral.
    what
        Well, you see... When two pals love each other dearly...
 
They play monopoly!
 
That way they can tell just how good they are at getting screwed by the other.
            and If we Play Catan, we can see how into rough stuff they are.
                Do you have wood for sheep?
                    I'm not Welsh
This happened to me and I thought I was playing a mod
Oh I've seen the description...thats a main reason I want one.
Not to mention the base rate is insanely generous with how much you get for the first 10 captures.

if you want to get exp you can reliably gain multiple levels in like 30 minutes of just messing around
It's really only a few times where the slow contruction rate feels grindy, but overall pretty fun. 

Me Personally? I'm playing the hell out of the new prince of persia right now. But I'm a huge sucker for SWAGGY metroidvanias, even if they are from ubi :(

prioritize carry capacity. 

at most, 1000 base hp maximum.

then stamina to a comfortable level (personal preference).

*edited and reworded to make more sense.*
    Yeah agreed on this. Being able to efficiently capture a ton of pals will help you level up faster (HP and stamina). Just be sure to build your first base on a spot with some resources (at least a couple ore veins and trees)
    Really? I'm over level 20 I have only put one point in health and I kinda wish I put it somewhere else
FYI there's a few pals who will boost your carry capacity in your team, and generally are strong world bosses so are decent team members. If you can catch a few of them, you can condense them to power up just one of them and make their special ability (carry capacity) more powerful (presumably, I've only boosted the speed of my mounts so far). You'd probably need to breed them to get enough to condense though.
I feel its better to focus on HP and stamina because you can always take Pals that increase your carry capacity when you need to go harvesting.  You can also use the Pal condenser to increase their bonus carrying capacity.
God this is such a nice QoL change for survival games. Not having to have the mats on me to make shit is amazing.
Heh... there's literally nothing to do in the game outside of grinding. Your goals are :

* Beat the towers (level 10/20/30/40/50), which requires a high level with good pals.
* Raise your level, which requires killing/capturing a *bunch* of pals.
* Complete the paldex, which requires capturing/breeding/hatching 10 of each specis.
* Get better pals, either through 1/9000 capture chances, or a shitton of breeding.
* Level up your base, by gathering *hundreds* of materials to build the next tier of building, with only the first tier of materials being natively automated (stone/wood), outside of a few exception (couple of pals can be ranched for mats).

It's definitely a fun grind (imo, to each their own), but it's literally only a grinding game.
    I find it laughable how people are calling this the Pokemon killer when their gameplay, besides catching creatures using balls, are not even close in similarity.
Apparently the devs went on record stating they had multiple legal teams scour the game for any IP infringement and came away clean. Doesn't mean they couldn't still get sued, but they are confident they would win if they did.
Oh I shamelessly love ARK, flaws and all. I just think it's funny that the immediate comparison is to Pokemon
I give it a month and there will be a porn mod, Im fucking calling it, I'm betting my left testicle on it

Remindme! 1 month

edit, i get to keep my left testicle
    There's already a nudity mod for thr player character
        I mean nude mods aren't technically porn mods, nice try attempting to steal my left testicle off the bet
            Damn! I really need a replacement...
                I just want another one. Three ball blues.
                Your chin will be fine
            I mean, back in my day nudie mags were porn. 

God i'm old.
    And they miss one if they don't call it: Pal Porn with the Porn Pal. And you can donate with PayPal.
    I guarantee you it was done before the game was even released.
        Inside job
    If that. Those Loverslab folks are *quick*.
    Just wait and there will be a harem version that replaces all the pals with random anime waifus.
        A downgrade
Just wait for the mods
Yet.
Freudian slip, huh.
Can't spell bestiality without best.
I wonder if at some point we'll be able to make brothels
    110%

I have a feeling this mod community is going to turn it up to GTA levels of debauchery. I‚Äôm so here for it, but I also fully expect it to result in controversy when it gets that far
I didn't think of doing that. I feel like it's good that I didn't think of that.
There has been other monster catching games in the past, most of them are Pokemon-like. Palmon helped catch people who are into monster catching, but are not looking for a Pokemon-like.

Monster Hunter for instance has it's own Pokemon styled game, but it would be crazy if you kept the combat of Monster Hunter, but included a way to tame the monsters to fight with you.  They almost have something like that in Rise, but is definitly not built to be played in a way like Palworld is.
    The problem with other ‚Äúmonster catching‚Äù game and the reason why none of them have even gotten a fragment of Pok√©mon‚Äôs impact (with exception of SMT/Persona which carved it‚Äôs own niche) is because they all focus on the turn-based battle aspect with Type strengths/weaknesses which Pok√©mon already mastered, making them all just ‚ÄúPok√©mon you play while waiting for the next real Pok√©mon game‚Äù
Palworld instead focuses on the idea of you SURVIVING and eventually thriving in this world. It‚Äôs what got to many people hyped for PLA in the first place (the idea of you sneaking under the tall grass stalking Pok√©mon while you could be attacked by a wild Pok√©mon without realising). This is a real alternative to the Monster Catching genre which none of Pok√©mon‚Äôs current supposed competitors offer
Persona is technically a monster-catching game - it has guns too!
    It's also a fucking chore 'catching' monsters in it.
        "Look Beelzebub, I just want to talk."
    Yeah, but Persona's gimmick is that it's like 90% of the same monsters every game.
Everybody is just sleeping too much on Monster Girl Quest Paradox. 

What everybody really wants is for *all* monsters to be fuckable.
I've never desired to make my pokemon do manual labor in slave like conditions or shove my pokemon into a blender and feed it to the others, but to each their own I guess...
I grew up loving Pokemon but it doesn't seem like anything about those games has significantly changed in nearly 30 years, if anything, they've gotten worse quality wise. I don't know if that's because Game Freak just doesn't know how to do a 3d game well, if the Switch hardware is hamstringing them, or a combination.

It's the sort of franchise that seems to be happy delivering roughly the same experience to the new generation coming up than it does maintaining interest with people as their tastes change. I can't really blame them, either, it's not like the market has told them anything different with how those games continue to sell amd Nintendo is apparently comfortable not attempting to chase a wider market.
> Palworld literally hits all the things I would wish Pokemon would do.

Pokemon cannibalism?
TemTem lost much of its initial appeal by going the GAAS/MMO route
    Not even that.  If they had done an MMO style game with actual MMO style updates it probably would be fine.  Instead, the devs said they aren't releasing expansions, aren't releasing new Tems, and don't plan on doing much patching at all.  You basically have all the downsides of an MMO with literally no upside.
    Yeah, Man. I have it for  the steam deck and every time i've tried to play it, the Always Online thing is such a pain in the butt.
That was the devs shooting themselves in the foot deliberately + greed more than anything, unless palworld devs are lobotomized they have a real chance of sticking
    I thought the drop off was the devs saying ‚Äúgames done, no new tems. No dlc or expansions‚Äù.
        Yeah that's what I was referring to when I said shooting themselves in the foot, should have specified mb

As for the greed bit, I was told some in game prices were inflated with 'longevity' or some other BS as the reason
            Didn't they go crazy with cosmetics and stuff? Just from reading steam reviews.
            Ah. I never played it. Didn‚Äôt realize it had a micro transaction shop.
        The "screw you, we got ours" approach.
I was hopeful for Temtem but honestly it just kind of sucked. 

It failed to have features Pokemon had since the very first gameboy game, like battle speed options. Every single battle is a slog because the combat is slow and any time an ability triggers the game pauses to tell you about it even if it's an ability that triggers constantly like "fire type moves do +10% damage". The map design isn't awful, but the placement of NPCs is. Windward Fort has the sort of design where wild pokemon spawn everywhere inside every few steps you take like Pokemon Caves, and they still jam-packed the place with 14 unskippable NPC battles and some skippable ones too. It's miserable, there are rooms you enter where you can see the exit but there's a congo line of 5 or 6 people just hanging out blocking the path. There's one room where you have to fight the NPCS "Overconfident Belsoto, Conceited Belsoto, Reckless Belsoto, Foolish Belsoto, and Undeceived Belsoto" one at a time in a forced hallway, while the random battles still spawn in too, and I recall this room because by NPC 4 I was like "this is such a time waster, do I even want to keep playing". FreeTem! as a system expects you to catch and release 50-400 creatures every week to get middling rewards, and this is a massive time sink because of how long battles take with no battle speed option. 


Temtem also added things that purely made the experience worse. Forced online and forced to see other players in the world constantly. This wouldn't be so bad, but the game is not optimized well and even on a really good PC I lag every time I go to an area that is important (like the towns) because the game has to load tons of people and their follower creatures in. The reason they force this at all is because the game is filled to the brim with microtransactions and part of the "value" of spending money on them is that you get to hold other players hostage and force them to see whatever silly hat you bought. I love buying clothes in the Pokemon games because it doesn't cost real money and there's no trouble from it, but Temtem does stuff like make changing item color use up expensive single use consumable items so they can keep getting you to spend on more of them, a far worse system only so they can squeeze money out of people. There are tons of systems designed to annoy you and advertise to you, like the classic battlepass where you get scraps for free and have to scroll past all the actually decent stuff you "earned" but can't have without paying for the pass, and a rotating shop of purchasable items where something like 5/6 are premium currency only and they put 1 mediocre item that can be bought with in-game currency at the very end of the list to force you to scroll past the paid stuff just to find out it's the same chair you have for free just painted a different shade of brown.

Temtem is not a game trying it's best to be a Pokemon killer, it's trying to squeeze money out of people and waste their time. The very first black and white pokemon games did a better job of respecting player time and giving a game that is enjoyable.
God the NPC's in that game are ugly
RemindMe! 6 months
Palword is literally Craftopia (PocketPair's last game, that's still in EA 4+ years) evolved.

To which Craftopia was a Zelda/Pokemon etc. rip-off.
    Good god playing that game blind knowing nothing going in was a WILD ride. 

"Oh hey they got the glide thing from Zelda......oh hey they got a straight up deku nut from Zelda.....wait, is that a tank? And a machine gun???" 

It's like the developers were like "oh hey I like this thing" and tossed whatever they could.
Moreover, there just isn't poop in the game! At least I think, haven't seen any yet.
Pokemon should 100% not be Palworld. There are aspects it can learn from, but mechanically they should not be the same.
Didn't Legends Arceus provide a somewhat fresh take on the gameplay and receive a ton of praise? Plus other spin-off games like Mystery Dungeon and Ranger are well-liked.

Pokemon fans are definitely receptive to a change in the formula, but it's far easier for Gamefreak to shit out the formulaic main series games, kids will buy it in droves regardless of quality.
But when you play the game, you don't encounter those elements. There is no evolving your Pals, or Pal battles (though in their roadmap they want to Pal battles), or badges, etc. The game through and through is a survival game. Like many have said it is way more a "rip-off" of Ark than it is Pokemon. Swap out dinosaurs for monsters and boom that is Palworld. Digimon, Cassette Beasts, TemTem, and many others take way more inspiration from Pokemon than Palworld does.
    This is why I keep looking up info about this game. It doesn't look anything like Pokemon to me and yet everyone swears its what Pokemon should be.

Starting to think the people saying this just don't like Pokemon, at its core, which is fine but like why not just talk about Palworld on its own merits?

Similarly the people trying to bring it down or sending in reports to Nintendo are just fucking weird. Why do we spend so much time do corporation work for them lmfao?
        Agreed for sure. I love Pok√©mon and while it's had its flaw in recent years. People do not (or can not at this point) talk about Palworld without talking about Pok√©mon. Palworld is not what Pok√©mon should or could be aside from graphics, but nobody specifies when they talk about it.

IMO, the more Pok√©mon gets brought up when talking about Palworld, the less Palworld actually compares on its own.
            Yeah I think Palworld can suffer long term if it keeps bringing people in under the assumption it's giving the Pokemon experience.

I also think the edgy tone to the gameplay might lose older players after a while. It's a great hype and streamer game so far like Lethal Company. I'm hoping they can convert that into something that stands on its own but the first step is to escape being derivative of a game not even in the same genre lol.
        >everyone swears its what Pokemon should be.

>Starting to think the people saying this just don't like Pokemon, at its core, which is fine but

THANK YOU for summarizing this. I like Palworld but all the Pokehate is driving me nuts. Pokemon is the goat. No, I'm not buying any of the new games because I'm not dumb, but a cool **turn-based RPG** where you collect the monsters you face and go on an adventure is also fun! And clearly a lot of people like it!

Again, I'm pro-Palworld, but mostly because it's a cheap game from a small studio. Yeah it's fun enough, but I would never want to punch rocks or tolerate this much jank in an actual Pokemon game. If I had to guess, I'd assume an older Pokemon game I never played before like Emerald would be overall more fun.

I want Pokemon to evolve but by making better games, not by switching to the punch rocks genre.
        I would never attempt to replace Pokemon with Palworld. Pokemon is a much more structured RPG experience, and while I think the modern games are pretty terrible, the older games are homeruns in that formula. Palworld is an unstructured, player driven experience that wouldn't fit the Pokemon design at all.

That being said, there are elements of Palworld that Pokemon can learn from. For example, being able to throw out any rideable Pal and actually ride them. In Pokemon, we always had place holder sprites or rental/specific Pokemon we would have to ride. Makes it more immersive if you would actually ride your Pokemon.
        its because palworld does not have its own merits to talk about‚Ä¶ All of its pal designs are copied over from pokemon and edited slightly, its janky and unpolished‚Ä¶ Their previous games are ALSO knockoffs of popular games (Botw and Hollow Knight). You don‚Äôt see this kind of popularity with those, because people in those communities actually have *standards* lol
        It might not play like Pok√©mon, but it very intentionally looks like Pok√©mon. Take the big yellow Pal in this meme. Are you really saying it doesn‚Äôt strongly resemble one specific Pok√©mon?
            It's electric Totoro.

It looks more like Electabuzz than Pikachu if that's what you're implying
                Electabuzz is the obvious answer
            I am talking from a purely gameplay perspective. You could put any cartoonish animal in front of me and I would on some level think it looks like a Pokemon that's just how brand recognition goes.
    Right but it intentionally has a coat of paint to resemble pokemon right down to the names
    I don't know why people keep saying Digimon. Yeah the name is similar and you have to take care of a "creature" but that's basically where it ends. That goes for the shows, games, and overall theme (except for tbe friendship is magic thing, but all media for children does this). The majority of Digimon games play NOTHING like Pokemon. 

Palworld is definitely closer to Pokemon than Digimon
That's not even the case, it's has some monster catching mechanics and some related names to pokemon (pokedex, pokeballs etc)  and that's basically it, it's among the other 10 types of game mechanics in the game, Pokemon didn't even "invent" this type of games... cathing monster were a thing way before pokemon. It's like if I added guns to super mario bros and say super mario is a rip off of Call of Duty because both have guns and fps mechanics, makes no sense lol... people are just mad that pokemon didn't make a decent game in years and a random indie studio with 4 guys in a basement did what they would not achieve even if invested billions in it.  
The entire hype of this game is that it got several random game mechanics together to work that most games wouldn't make even 1 work like having guns, crafting, survival, boss fights, base building etc, while most survival games fuck up with crafting or that every other catching monsters game sucks in the last 10 years(including pokemon) even if all they had was 1 job.
Tbf a lot of people hate Nintendo not for petty reasons but because Nintendo has been making shit Pok√©mon games. It‚Äôs a lot easier to accept a potentially lacklustre game from a small studio than to accept a bad game from Nintendo itself.

To have a smaller studio come out with something that rivals the quality of modern Pok√©mon games with very very similar game feel is an easy catch. It‚Äôs the same reason people got so hyped for fan games of Pok√©mon, the quality is so good and it legit rivals modern Pok√©mon content, AND your expectations aren‚Äôt high because it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs game freak.

If you have a Pok√©mon itch that needs scratching, this game can hit it. But at the same time it‚Äôs a twist on the genre. Hell even the line ‚ÄòPok√©mon with guns‚Äô sounds like fun if you like those games. Are there issues with quality and creativity? Yes. If that bothers you don‚Äôt buy it, it‚Äôs expensive for early access imo. But it f you enjoy games of this genre you will at least like this game.
Ive seen some ppl defend the designs by going ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about nintendo so idc if they plagiarize the pokemon designs‚Äù‚Ä¶, so yeah this is it

I'd be more interested in the diabetes cure from all that cotton candy for the factory workers
Luckily enough, lovander's level 2 in medicine production. Also, unrelated, but it has level 2 in handiwork and drops suspicious juice, so take that as you will.
I mean, making medicine is a skill isn't it?

so probably?
Speaking from experience, I see


Edit: no judging tho :3
What a horrible tragedy that could be...
Yeah kill enough and they'll constantly spawn like 10 level 50s on you
    So what you're saying is that i can have a squad of Cops as Pals?
        Yeah sort of but they're real annoying (along with annoying music). Will spawn on you while flying too lol
            How in the world do you get them to stop pursuing? Only way I can see is to just die
                > Only way I can see is to just die

That's what my friend and I did ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the internet said you can kill everyone and it'll stop, but they just kept spawning - it seemed impossible to down them all at once before more showed up.  We're also only levels ~15-20, so maybe that's easier as you level up.
                    Don't attack them yourself, you'll get more assault charges and it'll spawn more. Just let your pals take care of them, there might be 1 or 2 waves of respawns but they *will* stop after that. I frequent the no.1 reserve because I'm really trying to get a 4-star Petalia
        They dont fire their weapons after becoming pals. They just do melee attacks. Disappointing.
            You can teach them other moves
                Did they fix the glitch where they won‚Äôt use those moves, or do they actually work now?
If one of the guards sees you attacking one of the creatures, you get an alert sound that sounds an awful lot like the, "you committed a crime!" alert sound from Cyberpunk 2077, then a "Wanted!" box shows up in the top right corner, and then the guards start attacking you.
    Huh, there wasn't any cops there when I was. Guess I have to go commit crime again to see if they were just on break.
        From what I've seen

As you start capturing and knocking out pals in the reservation. Guards start taking up those slots more often than pals do.

A reservation will start with like 2 guards and will eventually have 20+ and no more pals.

 Getting spotted means certain death, but the rare pals are worth it.
            >Getting spotted means certain death, but the rare pals are worth it.

This has so much "African rhino poacher vs hardcore rangers" energy, it's making me ponder some major worldbuilding connotations for Palworld.
            Does it reset the # of guards after you die or something?
                When you get far away enough everything de-spawns and will spawn back in when rendered.

So unless you have a palbox on the reserve (which I haven't tried) everything should repopulate normally.

I've had problems losing lucky pals by getting too far away from them. Once they un-render, pals don't seem to stay.
            Question: can you capture the Guards? Haven't started playing yet, but this sounds like a great way to get a lot of human pals if so...
I've only crimed once, but it was kinda like GTA stars.  A single assault got the people nearby mad at me.  Once I hit 3, it started spawning level 24s.  At 5 assaults, they were level 30, and at 10 or so I was seeing level 50s.  They spawned in all around me (probably ~3 of them to start, up to 10ish at the peak), even after fast traveling somewhere else
"Criminal activity" doesn't do anything by itself, but those islands spawn cops. If any cop gets line of sight on you while you have that status, you'll become a wanted criminal for trespassing.¬† And if you attack a cop while another cop can see you, you'll become wanted for assault, as well.


To be clear, "line of sight" for them is a sight cone with some maximum range.¬† You have a little wiggle room.¬† Surprisingly, you can even shoot them from out of range of their sight, and they won't "see" you for criminal purposes until you get close enough.

            That's a lot of Pok√©mon to be fair.
            My grouping would be 5.25 inches at 50 yards.

The Harley Quinn cartoon wanted to put in a scene of him going down on Catwoman and D.C. said ‚ÄúNo, we won‚Äôt be able to sell toys of him if he goes down on her.‚Äù
                        I would buy a statue or action figures of Batman going down on Catwoman and I'm not even a comic fan, just a cunnilingus fan

    Ey there's the way-too-long-name I couldn't remember!
The raid names seem to change a bit. Mine was "Bandwagon Fan Girls" when we first encountered them.
I was so fucking confused when it said that. I ended up catching one though she's pretty powerful. My wife has a lot to say about it everytime she pops up on screen tho haha
    My friend caught one with multiple bonuses to work speed and all he could say was '.... sigh. She's 'very good with her hands''.
Yea, it will just pause the raid and resume in the morning, when your palkemon is more awake.
    Lol @ Palkemon. I'm stealing it just FYI. And thanks for the knowledge, I hadn't even thought of that.
    That's polite of them

Also a dog that resembles a certain Peanuts character instead of a pokemon.
    Oh, I get it. Because people smoked a loot of weed at Woodstock, right?
        I assume it's more about Snoopy being close to Snoop, who smokes a lot of weed.  Because Woodstock is the bird, not the dog.
            Frankly I just enjoy the fact that both connections are possible to make.
        Fwiw, I thought your Woodstock theory worked pretty well too lol.

Violence.

It's never the answer
    clever :D but by answering that question thusly you created an instance of it becoming a literal answer, and have further contributed to the total progressive breakdown of spacetime, which I appreciate :)

    the answer is always yes
The kid named ARK: Survival
    kid named terribly unoptimized "we don't know how to use more than 1 thread" buggy 300GB mess with wasted potential:
        "oh it's just a 20GB patch wait why is it redownloading everything!?"
        And despite all that, it's still a pretty great game.
            Only if you're forewarned about how awful the vanilla settings are.

Or if you don't value the commodity known as time.
Hot New version just dropped even lol
    for ASE or ASA? I havnt touched ASA since it launched due to how desastrous both the game and the shitstorm around the company decisions were. Is it any good now?
        ASA is better if you like the vanilla experience and graphical updates with PVE.  Some good quality of life stuff in there but its not quite where it needs to be yet and still has a ton of bugs.  ASE is probably still going to be the better route for stability and the overall mod availability.
            Alright so basically nothing has changed yet lol
This is a joke about Ark. Which is the game Palworld is apparently copying more than Pokemon.
    Palworld is basically someone going "What if we made Ark but good?"
        What if we made Ark with more than 15 frames per second?
    I think Studio Wildcard has burned far too many bridges for anyone to argue in their favour lol.
        Them dropping paid DLC/expansion during early access was the beginning of the end.
    They've definitely improved upon the game loop from Ark.  Also much, much less unreal engine jank from what I've seen.
    Or they genuinely want more dinosaur like designs in the game?
The shaft, you say?
    No, Joker, you can‚Äôt!

I don't think human pals drop anything when butchered.
I believe the mod is actually taken down now.
    Hope so for his sake. Japan's lack of fair use laws means he couldn't have it anyway, but charging money for it was like throwing gasoline on campfire next to a natural gas facility.
        If an American or Canadian developer makes a mod that violates Japanese laws what legal recourse is there for the Japanese company seeking damages? Could they sue internationally or something?
            Yes, and from what I hear they are pretty successful in those lawsuits. Nintendos litigation arm is world wide and successful from everything I've read recently. The fact Pocketpair is in Japan and not pursuing this means they probably won't in the future. 

I'm not sure if they go after every Tom Dick or Harry but others have already said that the modder got a Cease and Desist letter.
Like forcing a murder victim to dig their own grave, Jesus Christ...
    I did that exact same thing yesterday with a different Pokemon, but did it in front of all the other pals to set an example as to why you don't start slacking off.

And I'm just saying, they mostly stopped what they were doing and looked at the execution. And they've been great since. So I guess it worked
        I feel like I'm in a crusader Kings thread
            Average CK3 thread:

"How to get cucked by my wife, cuck her back and kill her?"

"I want to do eugenics, what stats I should max out on? Should they get the extra long chin trait of an Hapsburg?"

"Where genocide button? I want to kill all those dwarfs!"

"Can I put the bishop up my ass..." (wait, that's r/AnarchyChess)
                My brother killed my dog so I tried to execute him but failed and started a civil war where in I captured his gay lover who I then made into the anti-pope after killing my brother in combat and turning his wife and our sister into concubines.
                Sounds a bit like /r/Bannerlord - "My wife is pregnant; what happens if I kill her in the tourney?"
        So this game is Pokemon, but you're King Leopold II of Belgium.
    I have only played for a few hours but I was laughing when I had a pal hatch from an egg and immediately sent him to build his own bed.
It's a better Pok√©mon game than Pok√©mon Scarlet tbh

This game wouldn't have done the numbers it's done if Pok√©mon wasn't shitting out half assed beta builds and actually made a game worthy of the title, hopefully this has made some waves within Nintendo, but I doubt it
    It's not a better pokemon game that Scarlet, it's not a Pokemon game. Plays nothing like it.

Is it a better game than Scarlet/Violet? Fuckin absolutely. But saying it's a better pokemon game is disingenuous. They aren't similar.
        Plus, people ignoring the Legends Arceus which should‚Äôve been it‚Äôs comparison. Even then, it‚Äôs not a survival game
    Oh they see what happens and honestly, if they don't evolve pokemon they will loose money and that's the last thing they want. Last part I played was perl but I saw the open world part and it was the same? Almost No innovation. But now....
        The Pokemon games make the least revenue of any of their Pokemon products, they aren't worried. If toy sales dropped, then they would be concerned
            Also, it's not like pokemon games will stop selling. They sell like fucking crazy even as half assed releases. It's not like people are going to just stop buying pokemon because Palworld exists. Believe it or not people will buy the next pokemon game after having bought palworld.

Its not like Palworld is some revolution in gaming, it's just the game of the moment. 90% of people hoping pokemon crashes and burns because of Palworld will buy the next trash pokemon releases.
                Or maybe people should hope GameFreak and Nintendo simply builds more on the Legends series they started, which is the closest thing to PalWorld, instead of continuously comparing it to the core series masters release of Scarlett and Violet
            TBF they all fuel each other. So a drop in game sales would lead to a drop in licensed merch.
                Yes, this is like saying it doesn't matter how many people see the next Star Wars or Marvel film, the real money is in merch. Nobody is going to buy Iron Man armor 752 from Hot Toys for $700 if the movie that it's in bombs.
            According to Wikipedia, around 92% of their revenue comes from merchandices, versus 7% from the games.

They really don't need to improve their game to make money. They just need to make new cool and cute creatures.
        *lose
    >Pok√©mon Scarlet tbh

i mean, it's a completely different game lol. Comparing the two genres is kinda pointless.
    It‚Äôs gamefreak/the Pok√©mon company. Nintendo really doesn‚Äôt have that much control over the ip, they‚Äôre just the publisher. I doubt they‚Äôll step in as long as Pokemon is making money hand over fist. they have to be aware that the recent games are getting a lot of negative attention but until that attention leads to actual consequences then they‚Äôre not gonna care
Yeah, I'm reading that comment and thinking that is straight up Rimworld. Where I forced a husband to kill his wife and then eat her so he could survive.
It makes the one Pal stronger. 4, 8, 16, then 64. 116 Pals fed into one, to make it 4 star.
    I understand the concept of power-ups so it's nice that it actually accomplishes something but this person seems to be taking particular  delight in feeding them *their friends* and then *lying to them about it*. 

Why so they WANT to do that?
        It was probably added to have an alternative to just whacking them for food. If you breed for stats the amount of pals you generate is actually ridiculous and you quickly run out of room.
    How much stronger do they get when you go up in stars?
        They get 1 star stronger every star they go up
            I guess I meant more in terms of their power/strength. Like if a 0 star pokemon has 100 attack, what does a 2 star pokemon have?
                It‚Äôs maybe a 5-10% increase to the stats, but more importantly it increases the level of their ability. ¬†Example, better chicken gives more eggs or a mounted pal gets slightly faster. ¬†I will say the buffs to the abilities are way mor noticeable than the stats.
                There is marginal stat boosts to the core stats like HP/Defense/Attack however all Pals have a "Trait" of some sort, most are passive, like if its rideable or usable as a glider. Increase the star/rank of the Pal upgrades that trait. So Direhowls (wolf) get faster when mounted. Lunaris increases your carry weight more, Daedreams do more damage when out etc etc. I'm assuming the farmable pals would increase drop rate/frequency in the base.
Right? ‚ÄúThis game is so fucked up, it lets me do the stuff I desire. So fucked up!‚Äù
By fusing the Pals you increase a Pal from 0 stars to 1 star. It increases their stats and levels up their partner skill. 

I have a 3 star Chicken, I've fed him 52 chickens in the blender. All so that he lays more eggs.
because I wanted to combine the movie Madagascar and Highlander into a single video game.
Looking at you, Rimworld
    Or the worst of all, real world.
World of Tanks in shambles
Best marketing campaign to sell me on the game.
    the product markets itself has never been truer
    I've never played a single Pokemon game and never wanted to, but damn if I don't want to try Palworld out at this point...
It did the opposite for me.  Which I think makes this one of the best straight up game reviews I've ever seen?  It *actually tells you* in a single sentence if you'll want the game or not.  That's impressive.
In lore they actually enjoy battling, so it's more like you're a boxing trainer than a boxer trainer.
Its worth noting that all of this is a "creative interpretation" if what happens. 
None of this is depicted. You go up to a science machine with no animations, open a menu and pick a few mons from a box. Thats it. It is funny to describe because the game isnt actually showing you anything fucked up.

Its like when people describe some incredibly fucked thing they did in Dwarf fortress or Rimworld. It becomes funny when none of the cruelty is depicted and everything just "technically" happened
    A cruelty occurring onscreen is just gore, one occurring off screen is horror.
Its reskinned Ark. The reskin makes it look like Pokemon. The Pokemon comparison isn't going anywhere since they literally copied the art style for their monsters.
Except it's third person, so it's better.
Yes Officer, this comment here
[Joe Biden knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSn3QqJq1wQ)
    Oh my god this is amazing.  This is what AI is for.
    What's interesting to me is that the AI can't seem to replicate his stutter. Biden has dealt with that his whole life, but its never replicated in these models
        I feel like Biden wouldn't stutter in this instance, because he's practiced this speech a thousand times.
        If movies like the King's Speech are to be believed, stutterers frequently do not stutter when they are expressing something they are extremely emotional about, so it checks out here.
    What a world we live in.

Now I want to see a Trump one with his trademark incoherent rambling.
        Well, I don't have any kind of ai that can do it for you... maybe ElevenLabs? But I will try my best to provide text "worthy" of Trump:

Hey guys, did you know that... in terms of male human, and I know what a male human is, and you know what a male human is, but... not a female human, but a male human.... one that has a... you know.. one that has a... My father was a male and a human, and he told me when I was a kid... my father, Ted Trump, got very wealthy because of the male human, but if you think about male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, and I know you have. Who hasn't? The democrats, probably. They don't have the mind - the brains - to think about something complex like... they're too busy trying to define a male human to even think about breeding one. But if you think about a female Pok√©mon - as I have many times - if you think about one... you know, I met with Satoshi Tajiri, and we talked about Pok√©mon, and he told me, he said, "Ronald," that's what he calls me, Ronald, because they don't do their d's like... they don't do their d's. The Japanese. Very smart. Very smart people. Can't do their d's. He said, "Ronald, you know more about Pok√©mon than anyone at Nintendo. More than me. More than even Nintendo himself." So when I talk about Pok√©mon, you know that what I say is right and true. And when you take into account my father - went to Richmond Hill High School, by the way - and you take into account his knowledge of the male human, and you know that my knowledge - my extensive knowledge - of Pok√©mon, you have to know that Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans. It's true. It is. I wouldn't lie to you. It's Vaporeon. Not only are they in the field egg group, which is the best group, by the way, the only group that has eggs, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. That's big. It's not yuge, but it's big. It's bigger than... it's bigger than all the Pok√©mon that are smaller. The smaller Pok√©mon, they're called that, because they're a bit on the small side. The Vaporeon though, big. Bigly Pok√©mon. But what that means, is this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks. I know. I know. I know what you're thinking, but it's true. It's true. I went to Wharton, you know? It's true. Vaporeon can handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats - not as impressive as me, but impressive - their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Acid Armor, by the way doesn't mean it's made of acid. It means.. you know what it means. It's not... it's not real armor that you can wear. I mean, I can wear it. I can. It's true. It's... I've been known to wear some acid armor from time to time. 

But Vaporeon, due to their mostly water based biology there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet. I've seen Vaporeon before, not in real life, of course, but I've studied the models. I've studied... you know... they put the... these guys and their computers, it's so crazy what they can do now. So many people... I've seen'em. So many people would look at these guys on their computers, and their making with the ai - the artificial intelligence - the... computer brains... they just... They've got these computers, and I've seen'em and seen what they can do, and they showed me, and I understood it. I saw the models, and I knew.. I was asking questions, and they said, "Mr. Trump you know computers?" I said, "Sure I know computers. I'm not just a president, you know. I'm a... I use... you all have seen how much I'm on the computer. I know'em. I know computers. I almost became a programmer when I was in Wharton. I didn't. I decided to become rich instead. Not that programmers can't get rich. They can. You know... STEM... that's a.. they've gotta get more women in STEM. I can fix that. These Democrats, they talk about women and women's right, and they don't even know what a woman is, but I know. You all know that I know what a woman is. If there's anyone that knows what a woman is, it's me. Ha ha ha You know that. I know that.... the women... that's right... they all know that. So I... I see the models, these Vaporeon models, and I see'em, and I know them too, and these computer guys, they show'em to me, and I say to them, "That's a water based Pok√©mon. It's gotta be wet," and they say, "That's right. It is too!" And I see the models, and it's so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. I know that might sound crazy, but it's true. It's true. I've seen the models.

And they can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip. Now, these moves, they don't work on me, but for others, these moves, they would work on them. Along with that, they don't have fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. And who doesn't like being in the mood? With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue, and I tell ya... I tell ya... they would.. if it was me... they would be fatigued. But they can recover from that... that fatigue... with enough water. And I have water. The best water money can buy. It's the BEST water. I wish you could all taste the water I have. It's the best water. So I could use that best water with my Vaporeon, but even then... you don't NEED the best water. No. Vaporeon doesn't need it. But mine would have it.

No other Pok√©mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white.
            I swear his voice clicked into the narration two sentences in.
    Oh my god lol
No you aren't. üòù
Oh, is this what that whole meme is about? That was hilarious, I expected way grosser.
If you do want to know. [Here is Biden talking about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSn3QqJq1wQ)
    Oh my god
Sounds great until they kill all your pets and level your base
    Kinky
    Even with just mainly basic shit at the base, it's been harder for me to catch anything that raids. 

They seem to die too quickly
        I'm kinda okay with it since I seem to get raids every 20-25 minutes if I'm hanging out at the base lol.  Kind of annoying I basically need to be AWAY from all my work stations and base as a whole otherwise the game seems to detect me step close in proximity and just laughs and says RAID TIME BITCH.
            ...sooo...The Forest, with Pokemon?
        Surround your base with enough traps that is outside of your ~~Slaves~~ Pals alarm raidus.  LOL
            I tried that. But had to constantly reset the traps because I kept getting chickens, cats, and sheep. Lol. Then got annoyed enough that I just said screw it.
Might as well with wide open legs
Death by snu snu
what
    Well, you see... When two pals love each other dearly...
 
They play monopoly!
 
That way they can tell just how good they are at getting screwed by the other.
        and If we Play Catan, we can see how into rough stuff they are.
            Do you have wood for sheep?

Yeah agreed on this. Being able to efficiently capture a ton of pals will help you level up faster (HP and stamina). Just be sure to build your first base on a spot with some resources (at least a couple ore veins and trees)
Really? I'm over level 20 I have only put one point in health and I kinda wish I put it somewhere else
I find it laughable how people are calling this the Pokemon killer when their gameplay, besides catching creatures using balls, are not even close in similarity.
There's already a nudity mod for thr player character
    I mean nude mods aren't technically porn mods, nice try attempting to steal my left testicle off the bet
        Damn! I really need a replacement...
            I just want another one. Three ball blues.
            Your chin will be fine
        I mean, back in my day nudie mags were porn. 

God i'm old.
And they miss one if they don't call it: Pal Porn with the Porn Pal. And you can donate with PayPal.
I guarantee you it was done before the game was even released.
    Inside job
If that. Those Loverslab folks are *quick*.
Just wait and there will be a harem version that replaces all the pals with random anime waifus.
    A downgrade
110%

I have a feeling this mod community is going to turn it up to GTA levels of debauchery. I‚Äôm so here for it, but I also fully expect it to result in controversy when it gets that far
The problem with other ‚Äúmonster catching‚Äù game and the reason why none of them have even gotten a fragment of Pok√©mon‚Äôs impact (with exception of SMT/Persona which carved it‚Äôs own niche) is because they all focus on the turn-based battle aspect with Type strengths/weaknesses which Pok√©mon already mastered, making them all just ‚ÄúPok√©mon you play while waiting for the next real Pok√©mon game‚Äù
Palworld instead focuses on the idea of you SURVIVING and eventually thriving in this world. It‚Äôs what got to many people hyped for PLA in the first place (the idea of you sneaking under the tall grass stalking Pok√©mon while you could be attacked by a wild Pok√©mon without realising). This is a real alternative to the Monster Catching genre which none of Pok√©mon‚Äôs current supposed competitors offer
It's also a fucking chore 'catching' monsters in it.
    "Look Beelzebub, I just want to talk."
Yeah, but Persona's gimmick is that it's like 90% of the same monsters every game.
Not even that.  If they had done an MMO style game with actual MMO style updates it probably would be fine.  Instead, the devs said they aren't releasing expansions, aren't releasing new Tems, and don't plan on doing much patching at all.  You basically have all the downsides of an MMO with literally no upside.
Yeah, Man. I have it for  the steam deck and every time i've tried to play it, the Always Online thing is such a pain in the butt.
I thought the drop off was the devs saying ‚Äúgames done, no new tems. No dlc or expansions‚Äù.
    Yeah that's what I was referring to when I said shooting themselves in the foot, should have specified mb

As for the greed bit, I was told some in game prices were inflated with 'longevity' or some other BS as the reason
        Didn't they go crazy with cosmetics and stuff? Just from reading steam reviews.
        Ah. I never played it. Didn‚Äôt realize it had a micro transaction shop.
    The "screw you, we got ours" approach.
Good god playing that game blind knowing nothing going in was a WILD ride. 

"Oh hey they got the glide thing from Zelda......oh hey they got a straight up deku nut from Zelda.....wait, is that a tank? And a machine gun???" 

It's like the developers were like "oh hey I like this thing" and tossed whatever they could.
This is why I keep looking up info about this game. It doesn't look anything like Pokemon to me and yet everyone swears its what Pokemon should be.

Starting to think the people saying this just don't like Pokemon, at its core, which is fine but like why not just talk about Palworld on its own merits?

Similarly the people trying to bring it down or sending in reports to Nintendo are just fucking weird. Why do we spend so much time do corporation work for them lmfao?
    Agreed for sure. I love Pok√©mon and while it's had its flaw in recent years. People do not (or can not at this point) talk about Palworld without talking about Pok√©mon. Palworld is not what Pok√©mon should or could be aside from graphics, but nobody specifies when they talk about it.

IMO, the more Pok√©mon gets brought up when talking about Palworld, the less Palworld actually compares on its own.
        Yeah I think Palworld can suffer long term if it keeps bringing people in under the assumption it's giving the Pokemon experience.

I also think the edgy tone to the gameplay might lose older players after a while. It's a great hype and streamer game so far like Lethal Company. I'm hoping they can convert that into something that stands on its own but the first step is to escape being derivative of a game not even in the same genre lol.
    >everyone swears its what Pokemon should be.

>Starting to think the people saying this just don't like Pokemon, at its core, which is fine but

THANK YOU for summarizing this. I like Palworld but all the Pokehate is driving me nuts. Pokemon is the goat. No, I'm not buying any of the new games because I'm not dumb, but a cool **turn-based RPG** where you collect the monsters you face and go on an adventure is also fun! And clearly a lot of people like it!

Again, I'm pro-Palworld, but mostly because it's a cheap game from a small studio. Yeah it's fun enough, but I would never want to punch rocks or tolerate this much jank in an actual Pokemon game. If I had to guess, I'd assume an older Pokemon game I never played before like Emerald would be overall more fun.

I want Pokemon to evolve but by making better games, not by switching to the punch rocks genre.
    I would never attempt to replace Pokemon with Palworld. Pokemon is a much more structured RPG experience, and while I think the modern games are pretty terrible, the older games are homeruns in that formula. Palworld is an unstructured, player driven experience that wouldn't fit the Pokemon design at all.

That being said, there are elements of Palworld that Pokemon can learn from. For example, being able to throw out any rideable Pal and actually ride them. In Pokemon, we always had place holder sprites or rental/specific Pokemon we would have to ride. Makes it more immersive if you would actually ride your Pokemon.
    its because palworld does not have its own merits to talk about‚Ä¶ All of its pal designs are copied over from pokemon and edited slightly, its janky and unpolished‚Ä¶ Their previous games are ALSO knockoffs of popular games (Botw and Hollow Knight). You don‚Äôt see this kind of popularity with those, because people in those communities actually have *standards* lol
    It might not play like Pok√©mon, but it very intentionally looks like Pok√©mon. Take the big yellow Pal in this meme. Are you really saying it doesn‚Äôt strongly resemble one specific Pok√©mon?
        It's electric Totoro.

It looks more like Electabuzz than Pikachu if that's what you're implying
            Electabuzz is the obvious answer
        I am talking from a purely gameplay perspective. You could put any cartoonish animal in front of me and I would on some level think it looks like a Pokemon that's just how brand recognition goes.
Right but it intentionally has a coat of paint to resemble pokemon right down to the names
I don't know why people keep saying Digimon. Yeah the name is similar and you have to take care of a "creature" but that's basically where it ends. That goes for the shows, games, and overall theme (except for tbe friendship is magic thing, but all media for children does this). The majority of Digimon games play NOTHING like Pokemon. 

Palworld is definitely closer to Pokemon than Digimon
Noice.
So what you're saying is that i can have a squad of Cops as Pals?
    Yeah sort of but they're real annoying (along with annoying music). Will spawn on you while flying too lol
        How in the world do you get them to stop pursuing? Only way I can see is to just die
            > Only way I can see is to just die

That's what my friend and I did ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the internet said you can kill everyone and it'll stop, but they just kept spawning - it seemed impossible to down them all at once before more showed up.  We're also only levels ~15-20, so maybe that's easier as you level up.
                Don't attack them yourself, you'll get more assault charges and it'll spawn more. Just let your pals take care of them, there might be 1 or 2 waves of respawns but they *will* stop after that. I frequent the no.1 reserve because I'm really trying to get a 4-star Petalia
    They dont fire their weapons after becoming pals. They just do melee attacks. Disappointing.
        You can teach them other moves
            Did they fix the glitch where they won‚Äôt use those moves, or do they actually work now?
Huh, there wasn't any cops there when I was. Guess I have to go commit crime again to see if they were just on break.
    From what I've seen

As you start capturing and knocking out pals in the reservation. Guards start taking up those slots more often than pals do.

A reservation will start with like 2 guards and will eventually have 20+ and no more pals.

 Getting spotted means certain death, but the rare pals are worth it.
        >Getting spotted means certain death, but the rare pals are worth it.

This has so much "African rhino poacher vs hardcore rangers" energy, it's making me ponder some major worldbuilding connotations for Palworld.
        Does it reset the # of guards after you die or something?
            When you get far away enough everything de-spawns and will spawn back in when rendered.

So unless you have a palbox on the reserve (which I haven't tried) everything should repopulate normally.

I've had problems losing lucky pals by getting too far away from them. Once they un-render, pals don't seem to stay.
        Question: can you capture the Guards? Haven't started playing yet, but this sounds like a great way to get a lot of human pals if so...

Mr. Mime and Lopunny are in the same egg group.
    The only group I'd have for Mr. Mime in real life is "kill on sight".
        That's a lot of Pok√©mon to be fair.
        My grouping would be 5.25 inches at 50 yards.
    Mr. Mime (Gotham Form)

Instead of saying 'Mime' or 'Mr. Mime' the Gotham form of Mr. Mime often says strange things about scars and society.

Oh, I get it. Because people smoked a loot of weed at Woodstock, right?
    I assume it's more about Snoopy being close to Snoop, who smokes a lot of weed.  Because Woodstock is the bird, not the dog.

    Fwiw, I thought your Woodstock theory worked pretty well too lol.

Ah, I see you are also someone who really knows where their towel is.
clever :D but by answering that question thusly you created an instance of it becoming a literal answer, and have further contributed to the total progressive breakdown of spacetime, which I appreciate :)

the answer is always yes
kid named terribly unoptimized "we don't know how to use more than 1 thread" buggy 300GB mess with wasted potential:
    "oh it's just a 20GB patch wait why is it redownloading everything!?"
    And despite all that, it's still a pretty great game.
        Only if you're forewarned about how awful the vanilla settings are.

Or if you don't value the commodity known as time.
for ASE or ASA? I havnt touched ASA since it launched due to how desastrous both the game and the shitstorm around the company decisions were. Is it any good now?
    ASA is better if you like the vanilla experience and graphical updates with PVE.  Some good quality of life stuff in there but its not quite where it needs to be yet and still has a ton of bugs.  ASE is probably still going to be the better route for stability and the overall mod availability.
        Alright so basically nothing has changed yet lol
Palworld is basically someone going "What if we made Ark but good?"
    What if we made Ark with more than 15 frames per second?
I think Studio Wildcard has burned far too many bridges for anyone to argue in their favour lol.
    Them dropping paid DLC/expansion during early access was the beginning of the end.
They've definitely improved upon the game loop from Ark.  Also much, much less unreal engine jank from what I've seen.
Or they genuinely want more dinosaur like designs in the game?
No, Joker, you can‚Äôt!
Hope so for his sake. Japan's lack of fair use laws means he couldn't have it anyway, but charging money for it was like throwing gasoline on campfire next to a natural gas facility.
    If an American or Canadian developer makes a mod that violates Japanese laws what legal recourse is there for the Japanese company seeking damages? Could they sue internationally or something?
        Yes, and from what I hear they are pretty successful in those lawsuits. Nintendos litigation arm is world wide and successful from everything I've read recently. The fact Pocketpair is in Japan and not pursuing this means they probably won't in the future. 

I'm not sure if they go after every Tom Dick or Harry but others have already said that the modder got a Cease and Desist letter.
I did that exact same thing yesterday with a different Pokemon, but did it in front of all the other pals to set an example as to why you don't start slacking off.

And I'm just saying, they mostly stopped what they were doing and looked at the execution. And they've been great since. So I guess it worked
    I feel like I'm in a crusader Kings thread
        Average CK3 thread:

"How to get cucked by my wife, cuck her back and kill her?"

"I want to do eugenics, what stats I should max out on? Should they get the extra long chin trait of an Hapsburg?"

"Where genocide button? I want to kill all those dwarfs!"

"Can I put the bishop up my ass..." (wait, that's r/AnarchyChess)
            My brother killed my dog so I tried to execute him but failed and started a civil war where in I captured his gay lover who I then made into the anti-pope after killing my brother in combat and turning his wife and our sister into concubines.
            Sounds a bit like /r/Bannerlord - "My wife is pregnant; what happens if I kill her in the tourney?"
    So this game is Pokemon, but you're King Leopold II of Belgium.
I have only played for a few hours but I was laughing when I had a pal hatch from an egg and immediately sent him to build his own bed.
It's not a better pokemon game that Scarlet, it's not a Pokemon game. Plays nothing like it.

Is it a better game than Scarlet/Violet? Fuckin absolutely. But saying it's a better pokemon game is disingenuous. They aren't similar.
    Plus, people ignoring the Legends Arceus which should‚Äôve been it‚Äôs comparison. Even then, it‚Äôs not a survival game
Oh they see what happens and honestly, if they don't evolve pokemon they will loose money and that's the last thing they want. Last part I played was perl but I saw the open world part and it was the same? Almost No innovation. But now....
    The Pokemon games make the least revenue of any of their Pokemon products, they aren't worried. If toy sales dropped, then they would be concerned
        Also, it's not like pokemon games will stop selling. They sell like fucking crazy even as half assed releases. It's not like people are going to just stop buying pokemon because Palworld exists. Believe it or not people will buy the next pokemon game after having bought palworld.

Its not like Palworld is some revolution in gaming, it's just the game of the moment. 90% of people hoping pokemon crashes and burns because of Palworld will buy the next trash pokemon releases.
            Or maybe people should hope GameFreak and Nintendo simply builds more on the Legends series they started, which is the closest thing to PalWorld, instead of continuously comparing it to the core series masters release of Scarlett and Violet
        TBF they all fuel each other. So a drop in game sales would lead to a drop in licensed merch.
            Yes, this is like saying it doesn't matter how many people see the next Star Wars or Marvel film, the real money is in merch. Nobody is going to buy Iron Man armor 752 from Hot Toys for $700 if the movie that it's in bombs.
        According to Wikipedia, around 92% of their revenue comes from merchandices, versus 7% from the games.

They really don't need to improve their game to make money. They just need to make new cool and cute creatures.
    *lose
>Pok√©mon Scarlet tbh

i mean, it's a completely different game lol. Comparing the two genres is kinda pointless.
It‚Äôs gamefreak/the Pok√©mon company. Nintendo really doesn‚Äôt have that much control over the ip, they‚Äôre just the publisher. I doubt they‚Äôll step in as long as Pokemon is making money hand over fist. they have to be aware that the recent games are getting a lot of negative attention but until that attention leads to actual consequences then they‚Äôre not gonna care
I understand the concept of power-ups so it's nice that it actually accomplishes something but this person seems to be taking particular  delight in feeding them *their friends* and then *lying to them about it*. 

Why so they WANT to do that?
    It was probably added to have an alternative to just whacking them for food. If you breed for stats the amount of pals you generate is actually ridiculous and you quickly run out of room.
How much stronger do they get when you go up in stars?
    They get 1 star stronger every star they go up
        I guess I meant more in terms of their power/strength. Like if a 0 star pokemon has 100 attack, what does a 2 star pokemon have?
            It‚Äôs maybe a 5-10% increase to the stats, but more importantly it increases the level of their ability. ¬†Example, better chicken gives more eggs or a mounted pal gets slightly faster. ¬†I will say the buffs to the abilities are way mor noticeable than the stats.
            There is marginal stat boosts to the core stats like HP/Defense/Attack however all Pals have a "Trait" of some sort, most are passive, like if its rideable or usable as a glider. Increase the star/rank of the Pal upgrades that trait. So Direhowls (wolf) get faster when mounted. Lunaris increases your carry weight more, Daedreams do more damage when out etc etc. I'm assuming the farmable pals would increase drop rate/frequency in the base.
Or the worst of all, real world.
the product markets itself has never been truer
I've never played a single Pokemon game and never wanted to, but damn if I don't want to try Palworld out at this point...
A cruelty occurring onscreen is just gore, one occurring off screen is horror.
Oh my god this is amazing.  This is what AI is for.
What's interesting to me is that the AI can't seem to replicate his stutter. Biden has dealt with that his whole life, but its never replicated in these models
    I feel like Biden wouldn't stutter in this instance, because he's practiced this speech a thousand times.
    If movies like the King's Speech are to be believed, stutterers frequently do not stutter when they are expressing something they are extremely emotional about, so it checks out here.
What a world we live in.

Now I want to see a Trump one with his trademark incoherent rambling.
    Well, I don't have any kind of ai that can do it for you... maybe ElevenLabs? But I will try my best to provide text "worthy" of Trump:

Hey guys, did you know that... in terms of male human, and I know what a male human is, and you know what a male human is, but... not a female human, but a male human.... one that has a... you know.. one that has a... My father was a male and a human, and he told me when I was a kid... my father, Ted Trump, got very wealthy because of the male human, but if you think about male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, and I know you have. Who hasn't? The democrats, probably. They don't have the mind - the brains - to think about something complex like... they're too busy trying to define a male human to even think about breeding one. But if you think about a female Pok√©mon - as I have many times - if you think about one... you know, I met with Satoshi Tajiri, and we talked about Pok√©mon, and he told me, he said, "Ronald," that's what he calls me, Ronald, because they don't do their d's like... they don't do their d's. The Japanese. Very smart. Very smart people. Can't do their d's. He said, "Ronald, you know more about Pok√©mon than anyone at Nintendo. More than me. More than even Nintendo himself." So when I talk about Pok√©mon, you know that what I say is right and true. And when you take into account my father - went to Richmond Hill High School, by the way - and you take into account his knowledge of the male human, and you know that my knowledge - my extensive knowledge - of Pok√©mon, you have to know that Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans. It's true. It is. I wouldn't lie to you. It's Vaporeon. Not only are they in the field egg group, which is the best group, by the way, the only group that has eggs, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. That's big. It's not yuge, but it's big. It's bigger than... it's bigger than all the Pok√©mon that are smaller. The smaller Pok√©mon, they're called that, because they're a bit on the small side. The Vaporeon though, big. Bigly Pok√©mon. But what that means, is this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks. I know. I know. I know what you're thinking, but it's true. It's true. I went to Wharton, you know? It's true. Vaporeon can handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats - not as impressive as me, but impressive - their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Acid Armor, by the way doesn't mean it's made of acid. It means.. you know what it means. It's not... it's not real armor that you can wear. I mean, I can wear it. I can. It's true. It's... I've been known to wear some acid armor from time to time. 

But Vaporeon, due to their mostly water based biology there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet. I've seen Vaporeon before, not in real life, of course, but I've studied the models. I've studied... you know... they put the... these guys and their computers, it's so crazy what they can do now. So many people... I've seen'em. So many people would look at these guys on their computers, and their making with the ai - the artificial intelligence - the... computer brains... they just... They've got these computers, and I've seen'em and seen what they can do, and they showed me, and I understood it. I saw the models, and I knew.. I was asking questions, and they said, "Mr. Trump you know computers?" I said, "Sure I know computers. I'm not just a president, you know. I'm a... I use... you all have seen how much I'm on the computer. I know'em. I know computers. I almost became a programmer when I was in Wharton. I didn't. I decided to become rich instead. Not that programmers can't get rich. They can. You know... STEM... that's a.. they've gotta get more women in STEM. I can fix that. These Democrats, they talk about women and women's right, and they don't even know what a woman is, but I know. You all know that I know what a woman is. If there's anyone that knows what a woman is, it's me. Ha ha ha You know that. I know that.... the women... that's right... they all know that. So I... I see the models, these Vaporeon models, and I see'em, and I know them too, and these computer guys, they show'em to me, and I say to them, "That's a water based Pok√©mon. It's gotta be wet," and they say, "That's right. It is too!" And I see the models, and it's so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. I know that might sound crazy, but it's true. It's true. I've seen the models.

And they can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip. Now, these moves, they don't work on me, but for others, these moves, they would work on them. Along with that, they don't have fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. And who doesn't like being in the mood? With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue, and I tell ya... I tell ya... they would.. if it was me... they would be fatigued. But they can recover from that... that fatigue... with enough water. And I have water. The best water money can buy. It's the BEST water. I wish you could all taste the water I have. It's the best water. So I could use that best water with my Vaporeon, but even then... you don't NEED the best water. No. Vaporeon doesn't need it. But mine would have it.

No other Pok√©mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white.
        I swear his voice clicked into the narration two sentences in.
Oh my god lol
Oh my god
Kinky
Even with just mainly basic shit at the base, it's been harder for me to catch anything that raids. 

They seem to die too quickly
    I'm kinda okay with it since I seem to get raids every 20-25 minutes if I'm hanging out at the base lol.  Kind of annoying I basically need to be AWAY from all my work stations and base as a whole otherwise the game seems to detect me step close in proximity and just laughs and says RAID TIME BITCH.
        ...sooo...The Forest, with Pokemon?
    Surround your base with enough traps that is outside of your ~~Slaves~~ Pals alarm raidus.  LOL
        I tried that. But had to constantly reset the traps because I kept getting chickens, cats, and sheep. Lol. Then got annoyed enough that I just said screw it.
Well, you see... When two pals love each other dearly...
 
They play monopoly!
 
That way they can tell just how good they are at getting screwed by the other.
    and If we Play Catan, we can see how into rough stuff they are.
        Do you have wood for sheep?
            I'm not Welsh

I mean nude mods aren't technically porn mods, nice try attempting to steal my left testicle off the bet
    Damn! I really need a replacement...
        I just want another one. Three ball blues.
        Your chin will be fine
    I mean, back in my day nudie mags were porn. 

God i'm old.
Inside job
A downgrade
"Look Beelzebub, I just want to talk."
Yeah that's what I was referring to when I said shooting themselves in the foot, should have specified mb

As for the greed bit, I was told some in game prices were inflated with 'longevity' or some other BS as the reason
    Didn't they go crazy with cosmetics and stuff? Just from reading steam reviews.
    Ah. I never played it. Didn‚Äôt realize it had a micro transaction shop.
The "screw you, we got ours" approach.
Agreed for sure. I love Pok√©mon and while it's had its flaw in recent years. People do not (or can not at this point) talk about Palworld without talking about Pok√©mon. Palworld is not what Pok√©mon should or could be aside from graphics, but nobody specifies when they talk about it.

IMO, the more Pok√©mon gets brought up when talking about Palworld, the less Palworld actually compares on its own.
    Yeah I think Palworld can suffer long term if it keeps bringing people in under the assumption it's giving the Pokemon experience.

I also think the edgy tone to the gameplay might lose older players after a while. It's a great hype and streamer game so far like Lethal Company. I'm hoping they can convert that into something that stands on its own but the first step is to escape being derivative of a game not even in the same genre lol.
>everyone swears its what Pokemon should be.

>Starting to think the people saying this just don't like Pokemon, at its core, which is fine but

THANK YOU for summarizing this. I like Palworld but all the Pokehate is driving me nuts. Pokemon is the goat. No, I'm not buying any of the new games because I'm not dumb, but a cool **turn-based RPG** where you collect the monsters you face and go on an adventure is also fun! And clearly a lot of people like it!

Again, I'm pro-Palworld, but mostly because it's a cheap game from a small studio. Yeah it's fun enough, but I would never want to punch rocks or tolerate this much jank in an actual Pokemon game. If I had to guess, I'd assume an older Pokemon game I never played before like Emerald would be overall more fun.

I want Pokemon to evolve but by making better games, not by switching to the punch rocks genre.
I would never attempt to replace Pokemon with Palworld. Pokemon is a much more structured RPG experience, and while I think the modern games are pretty terrible, the older games are homeruns in that formula. Palworld is an unstructured, player driven experience that wouldn't fit the Pokemon design at all.

That being said, there are elements of Palworld that Pokemon can learn from. For example, being able to throw out any rideable Pal and actually ride them. In Pokemon, we always had place holder sprites or rental/specific Pokemon we would have to ride. Makes it more immersive if you would actually ride your Pokemon.
its because palworld does not have its own merits to talk about‚Ä¶ All of its pal designs are copied over from pokemon and edited slightly, its janky and unpolished‚Ä¶ Their previous games are ALSO knockoffs of popular games (Botw and Hollow Knight). You don‚Äôt see this kind of popularity with those, because people in those communities actually have *standards* lol
It might not play like Pok√©mon, but it very intentionally looks like Pok√©mon. Take the big yellow Pal in this meme. Are you really saying it doesn‚Äôt strongly resemble one specific Pok√©mon?
    It's electric Totoro.

It looks more like Electabuzz than Pikachu if that's what you're implying
        Electabuzz is the obvious answer
    I am talking from a purely gameplay perspective. You could put any cartoonish animal in front of me and I would on some level think it looks like a Pokemon that's just how brand recognition goes.
Yeah sort of but they're real annoying (along with annoying music). Will spawn on you while flying too lol
    How in the world do you get them to stop pursuing? Only way I can see is to just die
        > Only way I can see is to just die

That's what my friend and I did ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the internet said you can kill everyone and it'll stop, but they just kept spawning - it seemed impossible to down them all at once before more showed up.  We're also only levels ~15-20, so maybe that's easier as you level up.
            Don't attack them yourself, you'll get more assault charges and it'll spawn more. Just let your pals take care of them, there might be 1 or 2 waves of respawns but they *will* stop after that. I frequent the no.1 reserve because I'm really trying to get a 4-star Petalia
They dont fire their weapons after becoming pals. They just do melee attacks. Disappointing.
    You can teach them other moves
        Did they fix the glitch where they won‚Äôt use those moves, or do they actually work now?
From what I've seen

As you start capturing and knocking out pals in the reservation. Guards start taking up those slots more often than pals do.

A reservation will start with like 2 guards and will eventually have 20+ and no more pals.

 Getting spotted means certain death, but the rare pals are worth it.
    >Getting spotted means certain death, but the rare pals are worth it.

This has so much "African rhino poacher vs hardcore rangers" energy, it's making me ponder some major worldbuilding connotations for Palworld.
    Does it reset the # of guards after you die or something?
        When you get far away enough everything de-spawns and will spawn back in when rendered.

So unless you have a palbox on the reserve (which I haven't tried) everything should repopulate normally.

I've had problems losing lucky pals by getting too far away from them. Once they un-render, pals don't seem to stay.
    Question: can you capture the Guards? Haven't started playing yet, but this sounds like a great way to get a lot of human pals if so...
The only group I'd have for Mr. Mime in real life is "kill on sight".
    That's a lot of Pok√©mon to be fair.
    My grouping would be 5.25 inches at 50 yards.
Mr. Mime (Gotham Form)

Instead of saying 'Mime' or 'Mr. Mime' the Gotham form of Mr. Mime often says strange things about scars and society.
I‚Äôve seen this before but it reminded me of how Batman will sometimes hook up with Barbara. Like, yeah they should rethink that.
    > Batman will sometimes hook up with Barbara

Bruce Timm has done great things for Batman, but his weird Bruce/Babs thing always drags him down a bit.
        Who's the guy who said heros don't perform cunnilingus?
            Iirc it was D.C. Editorial.

The Harley Quinn cartoon wanted to put in a scene of him going down on Catwoman and D.C. said ‚ÄúNo, we won‚Äôt be able to sell toys of him if he goes down on her.‚Äù
                I would buy a statue or action figures of Batman going down on Catwoman and I'm not even a comic fan, just a cunnilingus fan
what the fuck dude
    I know. Having to go to YouTube to watch videos instead of them being allowed to be embedded? Fuck that.
Professionals have standard
palite
I assume it's more about Snoopy being close to Snoop, who smokes a lot of weed.  Because Woodstock is the bird, not the dog.
    Frankly I just enjoy the fact that both connections are possible to make.
Fwiw, I thought your Woodstock theory worked pretty well too lol.
The later books were actually really compelling but tend to get drowned out of the conversation by all the memorable moments in the first book made famous by the movie(s)
"oh it's just a 20GB patch wait why is it redownloading everything!?"
And despite all that, it's still a pretty great game.
    Only if you're forewarned about how awful the vanilla settings are.

Or if you don't value the commodity known as time.
ASA is better if you like the vanilla experience and graphical updates with PVE.  Some good quality of life stuff in there but its not quite where it needs to be yet and still has a ton of bugs.  ASE is probably still going to be the better route for stability and the overall mod availability.
    Alright so basically nothing has changed yet lol
What if we made Ark with more than 15 frames per second?
Them dropping paid DLC/expansion during early access was the beginning of the end.
If an American or Canadian developer makes a mod that violates Japanese laws what legal recourse is there for the Japanese company seeking damages? Could they sue internationally or something?
    Yes, and from what I hear they are pretty successful in those lawsuits. Nintendos litigation arm is world wide and successful from everything I've read recently. The fact Pocketpair is in Japan and not pursuing this means they probably won't in the future. 

I'm not sure if they go after every Tom Dick or Harry but others have already said that the modder got a Cease and Desist letter.
I feel like I'm in a crusader Kings thread
    Average CK3 thread:

"How to get cucked by my wife, cuck her back and kill her?"

"I want to do eugenics, what stats I should max out on? Should they get the extra long chin trait of an Hapsburg?"

"Where genocide button? I want to kill all those dwarfs!"

"Can I put the bishop up my ass..." (wait, that's r/AnarchyChess)
        My brother killed my dog so I tried to execute him but failed and started a civil war where in I captured his gay lover who I then made into the anti-pope after killing my brother in combat and turning his wife and our sister into concubines.
        Sounds a bit like /r/Bannerlord - "My wife is pregnant; what happens if I kill her in the tourney?"
So this game is Pokemon, but you're King Leopold II of Belgium.
Plus, people ignoring the Legends Arceus which should‚Äôve been it‚Äôs comparison. Even then, it‚Äôs not a survival game
The Pokemon games make the least revenue of any of their Pokemon products, they aren't worried. If toy sales dropped, then they would be concerned
    Also, it's not like pokemon games will stop selling. They sell like fucking crazy even as half assed releases. It's not like people are going to just stop buying pokemon because Palworld exists. Believe it or not people will buy the next pokemon game after having bought palworld.

Its not like Palworld is some revolution in gaming, it's just the game of the moment. 90% of people hoping pokemon crashes and burns because of Palworld will buy the next trash pokemon releases.
        Or maybe people should hope GameFreak and Nintendo simply builds more on the Legends series they started, which is the closest thing to PalWorld, instead of continuously comparing it to the core series masters release of Scarlett and Violet
    TBF they all fuel each other. So a drop in game sales would lead to a drop in licensed merch.
        Yes, this is like saying it doesn't matter how many people see the next Star Wars or Marvel film, the real money is in merch. Nobody is going to buy Iron Man armor 752 from Hot Toys for $700 if the movie that it's in bombs.
    According to Wikipedia, around 92% of their revenue comes from merchandices, versus 7% from the games.

They really don't need to improve their game to make money. They just need to make new cool and cute creatures.
*lose
It was probably added to have an alternative to just whacking them for food. If you breed for stats the amount of pals you generate is actually ridiculous and you quickly run out of room.
They get 1 star stronger every star they go up
    I guess I meant more in terms of their power/strength. Like if a 0 star pokemon has 100 attack, what does a 2 star pokemon have?
        It‚Äôs maybe a 5-10% increase to the stats, but more importantly it increases the level of their ability. ¬†Example, better chicken gives more eggs or a mounted pal gets slightly faster. ¬†I will say the buffs to the abilities are way mor noticeable than the stats.
        There is marginal stat boosts to the core stats like HP/Defense/Attack however all Pals have a "Trait" of some sort, most are passive, like if its rideable or usable as a glider. Increase the star/rank of the Pal upgrades that trait. So Direhowls (wolf) get faster when mounted. Lunaris increases your carry weight more, Daedreams do more damage when out etc etc. I'm assuming the farmable pals would increase drop rate/frequency in the base.
I feel like Biden wouldn't stutter in this instance, because he's practiced this speech a thousand times.
If movies like the King's Speech are to be believed, stutterers frequently do not stutter when they are expressing something they are extremely emotional about, so it checks out here.
Well, I don't have any kind of ai that can do it for you... maybe ElevenLabs? But I will try my best to provide text "worthy" of Trump:

Hey guys, did you know that... in terms of male human, and I know what a male human is, and you know what a male human is, but... not a female human, but a male human.... one that has a... you know.. one that has a... My father was a male and a human, and he told me when I was a kid... my father, Ted Trump, got very wealthy because of the male human, but if you think about male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, and I know you have. Who hasn't? The democrats, probably. They don't have the mind - the brains - to think about something complex like... they're too busy trying to define a male human to even think about breeding one. But if you think about a female Pok√©mon - as I have many times - if you think about one... you know, I met with Satoshi Tajiri, and we talked about Pok√©mon, and he told me, he said, "Ronald," that's what he calls me, Ronald, because they don't do their d's like... they don't do their d's. The Japanese. Very smart. Very smart people. Can't do their d's. He said, "Ronald, you know more about Pok√©mon than anyone at Nintendo. More than me. More than even Nintendo himself." So when I talk about Pok√©mon, you know that what I say is right and true. And when you take into account my father - went to Richmond Hill High School, by the way - and you take into account his knowledge of the male human, and you know that my knowledge - my extensive knowledge - of Pok√©mon, you have to know that Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans. It's true. It is. I wouldn't lie to you. It's Vaporeon. Not only are they in the field egg group, which is the best group, by the way, the only group that has eggs, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. That's big. It's not yuge, but it's big. It's bigger than... it's bigger than all the Pok√©mon that are smaller. The smaller Pok√©mon, they're called that, because they're a bit on the small side. The Vaporeon though, big. Bigly Pok√©mon. But what that means, is this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks. I know. I know. I know what you're thinking, but it's true. It's true. I went to Wharton, you know? It's true. Vaporeon can handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats - not as impressive as me, but impressive - their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Acid Armor, by the way doesn't mean it's made of acid. It means.. you know what it means. It's not... it's not real armor that you can wear. I mean, I can wear it. I can. It's true. It's... I've been known to wear some acid armor from time to time. 

But Vaporeon, due to their mostly water based biology there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet. I've seen Vaporeon before, not in real life, of course, but I've studied the models. I've studied... you know... they put the... these guys and their computers, it's so crazy what they can do now. So many people... I've seen'em. So many people would look at these guys on their computers, and their making with the ai - the artificial intelligence - the... computer brains... they just... They've got these computers, and I've seen'em and seen what they can do, and they showed me, and I understood it. I saw the models, and I knew.. I was asking questions, and they said, "Mr. Trump you know computers?" I said, "Sure I know computers. I'm not just a president, you know. I'm a... I use... you all have seen how much I'm on the computer. I know'em. I know computers. I almost became a programmer when I was in Wharton. I didn't. I decided to become rich instead.

If there's anyone that knows what a woman is, it's me. Ha ha ha You know that. I know that.... the women... that's right... they all know that. So I... I see the models, these Vaporeon models, and I see'em, and I know them too, and these computer guys, they show'em to me, and I say to them, "That's a water based Pok√©mon. It's gotta be wet," and they say, "That's right. It is too!" And I see the models, and it's so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. I know that might sound crazy, but it's true. It's true. I've seen the models.

And they can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip. Now, these moves, they don't work on me, but for others, these moves, they would work on them.

It's the best water. So I could use that best water with my Vaporeon, but even then... you don't NEED the best water. No. Vaporeon doesn't need it. But mine would have it.

No other Pok√©mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white.

They really don't need to improve their game to make money. They just need to make new cool and cute creatures.
I guess I meant more in terms of their power/strength. Like if a 0 star pokemon has 100 attack, what does a 2 star pokemon have?
    It‚Äôs maybe a 5-10% increase to the stats, but more importantly it increases the level of their ability. ¬†Example, better chicken gives more eggs or a mounted pal gets slightly faster. ¬†I will say the buffs to the abilities are way mor noticeable than the stats.
    There is marginal stat boosts to the core stats like HP/Defense/Attack however all Pals have a "Trait" of some sort, most are passive, like if its rideable or usable as a glider. Increase the star/rank of the Pal upgrades that trait. So Direhowls (wolf) get faster when mounted. Lunaris increases your carry weight more, Daedreams do more damage when out etc etc. I'm assuming the farmable pals would increase drop rate/frequency in the base.
I swear his voice clicked into the narration two sentences in.
...sooo...The Forest, with Pokemon?
I tried that. But had to constantly reset the traps because I kept getting chickens, cats, and sheep. Lol. Then got annoyed enough that I just said screw it.
Do you have wood for sheep?

I just want another one. Three ball blues.

That's what my friend and I did ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the internet said you can kill everyone and it'll stop, but they just kept spawning - it seemed impossible to down them all at once before more showed up.  We're also only levels ~15-20, so maybe that's easier as you level up.
    Don't attack them yourself, you'll get more assault charges and it'll spawn more. Just let your pals take care of them, there might be 1 or 2 waves of respawns but they *will* stop after that. I frequent the no.1 reserve because I'm really trying to get a 4-star Petalia
Did they fix the glitch where they won‚Äôt use those moves, or do they actually work now?
When you get far away enough everything de-spawns and will spawn back in when rendered.

So unless you have a palbox on the reserve (which I haven't tried) everything should repopulate normally.

I've had problems losing lucky pals by getting too far away from them. Once they un-render, pals don't seem to stay.
Who's the guy who said heros don't perform cunnilingus?
    Iirc it was D.C. Editorial.

The Harley Quinn cartoon wanted to put in a scene of him going down on Catwoman and D.C. said ‚ÄúNo, we won‚Äôt be able to sell toys of him if he goes down on her.‚Äù
        I would buy a statue or action figures of Batman going down on Catwoman and I'm not even a comic fan, just a cunnilingus fan
My brother killed my dog so I tried to execute him but failed and started a civil war where in I captured his gay lover who I then made into the anti-pope after killing my brother in combat and turning his wife and our sister into concubines.
Sounds a bit like /r/Bannerlord - "My wife is pregnant; what happens if I kill her in the tourney?"
Or maybe people should hope GameFreak and Nintendo simply builds more on the Legends series they started, which is the closest thing to PalWorld, instead of continuously comparing it to the core series masters release of Scarlett and Violet
