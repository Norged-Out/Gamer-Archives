[[How on earth is this Palworld game so popular]]


[deleted]


Pokemon fans are starved for a decent game + survival game so the Valheim/survival game crowd is in + ‚ÄúPokemon + guns‚Äù memeability
    It's also a concept that appeals to a ton of demographics. My entire group of friends are playing, and we mostly aren't Pokemon players. Also, many of our partners are playing as well, despite them not being heavy gamers. It's a perfect storm type of game, scratching many itches.
        ARK players, too. I have fond memories of that game, but it‚Äôs so janky and such a pain in so many ways. Palwork takes out a lot of the friction from Ark (like long taming times and limited abilities to automate dinosaurs working).¬†
            I‚Äôm a current ark player and the amount of ex tribe mates that are begging me to come play is ridiculous
                lmao same. this game in my opinion has a chance to be almost as big or bigger than ark
                    It already dwarfs Ark like the sun dwarfs the Earth
            And Palworld is only a fraction of the GBs Ark takes.
                I was wondering about that. Why does Ark take so much disk space, makes no sense
                    Just terrible optimization
                    Lots of it is the maps, you can reduce the space by only installing some of them.  The game has like 10 different world maps that are pretty detailed and a lot of extra data tied to them plus unique textures.
                69 likes
            All of that is completely customizable in Ark. How could you not be aware of that?
        This is true. My wife is not a gamer, but she played for 15 hours straight yesterday.
        It has co-op?
            yes, up to 32 players
                I would say there is co-op up to 4 people and then there are servers with 32 players. I have not tried pal world solo with friends but I'm playing on a dedicated server with friends
        It's like a Among us/Fall guys/ Lethal company kinda game, There is one of those every year lmao
            except those games never even came close to Dota 2, dota 2s all time peak is 1,295,114 and Palworlds is 1,291,967. Palworld only came out 3 days ago and I hadn't ever heard of it before yesterday, How tf is all this possible? especially since when looking at gameplay and trailers it doesn't look like anything special, on top of that is $40???  its literally the most-played paid game of all time how does this make sense.

edit: the above number is the peak player count on steam alone
                And it launched on game pass, and those numbers don‚Äôt even include game pass, that‚Äôs the really insane detail that no one is mentioning.
                Damn I knew it was a big deal but not THAT big of a deal, this is insane lmao

can anyone who has played it let us know if the game is actually good? XD
                PUBG hit 3mil+ when it was paid back in 2018, so idk about that?
                    Damn, I forgot abt that i thought it was always free for some reason, no one seems to be mentioning it. Ive seen game news sites say Palworld's the most played paid game of all time,

  Regardless tho 2nd place is still insane. Pubg was literally impossible to miss back then, same with games like among us i mean literally every single creator I watched was playing these games, but I haven't seen almost anyone posting vids about Palword even now a couple of days after ea release. I just don't get how the game's so dang popular
                >and I hadn't ever heard of it before yesterday, How tf is this all possible?

You just dont spend any time on Twitter, Twitch or Youtube.  Period.  That wasnt really that difficult to deduce.  If you're not on the internet, you're not going to hear about things.  Pretty simple concept I would say.
        What's your age range? Cus I look at the videos for this game and it looks like a game made for teens tbqh. But I guess you late 20 early 30 peeps were into Pokemon too.
    i hate pokemon and i love palworld, its more like Ark than Pokemon imo
        100% Agreed people comparing it to Pokemon is basically a buzz word now.
            It's far more like ark in gameplay than Pokemon, but ANY creature collection game gets compared to Pokemon.

                    Palworld is not in an active lawsuit with Nintendo.
                        My bad, Nintendo is in the process of finalizing their lawsuit because palworld is in clear copyright violation ü§¶ use commonsense
                            What exactly are they in violation of? I highly doubt Palworld would've even hit market if they had grounds for litigation given it was anmounced im 2021. The person who was selling mods using their IP already got a cease and desist.

Also copyright infringement isn't a common sense thing. Or maybe it is to you. Are you a patent lawyer?  

Even if they did sue it doesn't mean they would win either. The proof would have to be incontrovertible and I've yet to see anything unless you know something nobody else does.
                                Not to mention the headlines for palworld is "Pok√©mon with guns", like hello??? Doesn't take a rocket scientist ü§¶
                                    Those are journalists who write those headlines not the developers...
                                    Absolutely nowhere on the game does it say that, dude you ate so full of shit. Every sentence you have made on this post is pure lies. Just because you read some person on the internet saying it's pokemon with guns doesn't mean it's official palworld news. You are either 12 or just an idiot
                                [Forbes ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/01/24/the-pokemon-company-announces-it-will-investigate-palworld-ip-and-assets/)

[bbc](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-68092330)

[Marketing-Interactive](https://www.marketing-interactive.com/pokemon-copyright-investigation-palworld)

[CharlieIntel](https://www.charlieintel.com/pokemon/the-pokemon-company-confirm-theyre-investigating-palworld-copyright-allegations-299891/)

‚ÄúWe have not granted any permission for the use of Pok√©mon intellectual property or assets in that game,‚Äù the company said in a statement.

‚ÄúWe intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pok√©mon,‚Äù it added.


Do I need to say more?
                                    You clearly aren't reading any of the links you posted lmao. These are all quotes from the above articles. 

"The Pok√©mon Company also said that the investigations are in response to having received many inquiries regarding an unnamed game by another company released in January"

"While it is significant that The Pok√©mon Company issued a statement about this situation, the way it reads does not really imply anything much would probably happen here. Nintendo has says they haven‚Äôt licensed any IP or assets to Palworld which I mean, of course they didn‚Äôt."

"As for IP, clearly no actual terms or exact characters from Pok√©mon are being used. Nintendo immediately got a Pok√©mon reskin mod for Palworld taken down when it went live, and I cannot see them having much of a case comparing two electric mice and proving that the concept infringes on Pikachu. You can‚Äôt copyright the concept of an electric mouse."

"Palworld was also in development for many years before this so this is not exactly news to The Pok√©mon Company and Nintendo that this game and its Pok√©mon-adjacent monsters exist. This reads like a statement that they should probably say something given how big this game has gotten, though I would be amazed if this ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù turned up anything that could cause real harm to Palworld, which at the time of this writing, has just passed eight million copies sold in six days."
                                It's just commonsense buddy, a game that has nothing to do with Nintendo comes out with a game that has "Pok√©mon" that are basically ripping off Pok√©mon; sorry you can't piece that together?
                                    I only responded to you because you said they were in the middle of an active lawsuit which is verifiably untrue. Idk why youre being a dick about it. 

"Basically" doesn't sound iron clad to me personally. If it was so open and shut then sales would likely *already* be blocked and it would be incredibly easy to point out where exactly the infringement is. Palworld isn't the first game to use the catching monsters concept and Pok√©mon wasn't the first. Do you have actual examples? Have you played the game? 

The person who did side by sides on blender of 3D models that went viral already recanted their statements and admitted to exaggerating the similarities. 

Could Nintendo sue? Sure. Anyone can sue anyone for anything. Do they have grounds? It doesn't seem like it, but I suppose we will see. I just highly doubt Nintendo would've let Palworld sell 6 million copies if it's as cut and dry as you are implying.
                    No its not you just completely made that shit up.
            That's because most people are like OP, they only know it from a few images.
    Yeah we are, the game basically makes itself and GF/Nintendo can't/won't make it. They could just make the anime a playable game that runs at a stable 30 FPS and most people would probably be happy
        Hopefully this will show them that the fans will clamor for something more than the old formula and Game Freak will maybe change things up.
            I mean they did something good with Arceus so if they could expand on that by about ten fold then we could have a really decent game.
                Arceus is like the beta test to what Palworld is.
                    Arceus is like bedof and palworld is like arceus
            Oh they know, but since the stuff they keep pushing out sells just fine, they don't care
                It‚Äôs crazy that capitalism or whatever you want to call it, evolved Pokemon to this point. The amount of money they are missing out on by taking risks making good products over safe bets‚Ä¶.who knows
                    Pokemon Violet in all it's shoddy, bland glory sold 23.2 MILLION copies. Nintendo isn't missing out on anything.
            Pokemon fans have been hoping that for years upon years now. Everytime a new monster collecting game gets popular, nothing changes.
                Because the games sell. The adults who‚Äôve been playing for years can‚Äôt let go, and parents buy for their kids. The simple nature of story is friendly for young children dipping into JRPGS, while online battling tends more to the long time players, or even shiny hunting. People complain about the system, but remember. The franchise that was only supposed to be one game, is still marking millions of sales. SwSh and SV despite being ‚Äúhated‚Äù are second and third respectively in sales behind the original games.
            they're an Japanese company, like hell they'll change.
        they "can't/won't" make it because it was never the purpose of pokemon.  


Pokemon always been a children game. An entry milestone in video game. Your first mythic triple A game.   


It was not ment to be 20 years story arc with each extension answering the previous to accompany a loser from 7yo to the tomb.  


Pokemon fandom are just degenerates and people asking for mature pokemon games are just failures. You guys can't even comprehend these simple things and are simping on a zero effort game ripping off everything from UI to DA and mechanics.   


You are just pathetic manchild, lol, grow up mother fucker.
    This. Minus the guns and stuff, this is the Pok√©mon game I‚Äôve been waiting for since the jump to 3d. I played so much today my eyes hurt.
    "Pokemon fans are starved for a decent game" is me and is very accurate. I've been playing pokemon since the gba era and I am disappointed with scarlet violet lol. Hoping they make another Legends Arceus soon. But for now, I'm really enjoying palworld
    Plus it was being talked about a lot before release, OP may have missed it but it surely wasn't for lack of publicity
        I also missed it and I am always looking for new exciting games literally everywhere, i don't understand how it's so popular, I had never even heard of it before yesterday
    >Pokemon fans are starved for a decent game 

Try saying this r\\pokemon. Bruh those children cant take it and will ban you or delete the post.
    I've never played Pok√©mon but I'm thoroughly addicted to Palworld! I skimmed by it in Game Pass for weeks before finally giving it a shot and so glad I did. I haven't been so involved and fascinated by a game since picking up Destiny for the first time when it was in alpha testing.

I do wish they would get the maps built out though. I have 2 dead bodies I'd like to go pick up under the floor in the top right side of the map.
    This. Pokemon fans have wanted an open world game like this for decades. Ark gave the blueprint. Sprinkle in some Zelda and you've got a great game.

There's so much potential to take this game even further tbh. If Nintendo had done it this could have been the Ocarina of Time of Pokemon games.
    I don't get it, I haven't played Scarlet and Violet yet, but the most recent pokemon games have been incredible. and are still have an easy alignment with the rest of the franchise, although this palworld game seems fun.
    Most pokemon fans are not starved for a decent game lmao. Performance issues aside scarlet and violent was amazing for hardcore fans
It‚Äôs survival Pok√©mon with guns and slavery. That seems to appeal to people
    Likely this is scratching an itch that people have wanted Pokemon to scratch for a long time
        Drop the survival aspect and I'd been more interested tbh.

The itch I have is a more grown up jrpg version, arceus was in the right direction
            You can drop most of the survival aspects in settings.
                Survival only plays a role early. Once you have your first berry farm you have infinite food. Maybe in the future they change stuff because right now that's all you need. You don't even need water.

What is nice though is that your Pokemon get sick and you have to craft medicine. Or catch a new one too replace the slave hahaha
                    Strict up survival is pretty tame that is true, however it comes with many gameplay aspects that are generally used in survival games like based building, lots of farming etc. The core Gameplay-loop is more like a survival than a Pokemon game.
                I‚Äôm having a lot more fun since doing this. Can‚Äôt be bothered with survival games where you‚Äôre constantly battling hot/cold and hunger.
                    The problem for me is they always make the hunger deplete way too fast. Same with thirst if implemented. I know you can change it in settings but my first playthrough has been just normal to get the hang of things.

Catching pals is pretty damn easy. Caught lvl 15 dinos and a lvl 15 deer at lvl 7. Also caught a lvl 11 giant bird. All at lvl 7. 

The punk looking Dino kid is a pretty good companion for catching other pals. 

It would be really cool to be able to have all 5 pals out following you.
                Is it still fun as a single player game?
                    I've only played alone so far and I'm having fun. hoping my friends decide to get it at some point to try co-op
                    Haven't touched multiplayer yet and probably never will except for when my wife finally has time and the mental energy to play but solo has been an absolute blast.
                    I hear one of the main reasons single player works so well with this game is thanks to the pals, since you will neither feel alone nor will have to do all the work of resource gathering by yourself since you have, well, you know, your pals.
                    It‚Äôs server to server, so solo is for your intense grind and base building and then multiplayer is just to chill on
                        No?

You just have 1 friend host an open server so you and your friends can drop in and out at any time 24/7.

 That's where the real fun of these games lie.
                Explain

No way I got down voted because I wanted to know something lol

                    Money can be *exchanged* for goods and services!
                        God damn it you beat me too it.
                    You can adjust difficulty and the various difficulty gives or takes away things that add to the game. Or you can set a custom difficulty like enemy HP or ATK exp and things of that nature. I can‚Äôt remember the full list of settings but you can change it to how you want to play.
            The game is extremely customizable. You can tune almost every setting to the point you can drastically limit survival elements to be trivial.
            Try it, it's everything people wanted arceus to be. Survival is there but after the beginning it takes less relevance.
                Yeah it honestly isnt really survival. You kill one pal every now and again if you're hungry, normal difficulty hunger drain is basically negligible
                    You don't even need to kill Pals for food once you get the Pal that produces berries for you. In our private server, between the 5 of us, we all have at least 100 cooked berries on each of us and at least 150 in our food basket and another 200+ in the fridge
                    an hour in you get a feed bag also that auto fees.
                    You realize you can have chickens hatch eggs for you right?
                I did on gamepass, I found the tutorial borderline useless as it didn't explain how to do things just what to do. Even eating food took pressing every button trying to figure out which worked. Everything felt and looked unfinished. Hearing the survival aspect drops off it nice to hear tho

Maybe in a few patches, but I'm aware the gamepass version is wya before the steam. Version
                    The game has a section in the options called survival guide. It explains most of the things.
                    To each their own, but I‚Äôm genuinely sick of long winded tutorials that I‚Äôm forced to complete. This game has a short quick one that in theory you don‚Äôt even have to do. I rate that highly. Let me work stuff out for myself, sick of being told how to do absolutely EVRRYTHING in every game I play. Let me learn it myself if I want to. (I understand some want full tutorials, but more games need to make it optional)
            Digimon Cyber Sleuth is what you‚Äôre looking for.
                Such a great game. Was not expecting how dark some of the cases got.

Edit: Think I still need to actually beat it and start the 2nd game.
                    I was not expecting Hacker's Memory to be as good as it was, but it's a really interesting story and it's fun how it intersects with the main story of Cybersleuth.
                This is something that has interested me, need to check how it runs on deck
            The settings basically allow you to remove the survival aspect
            I just change the world settings to not deal with the survival aspects since I also hate survival games. 

Honestly this game would be so much better if it didn't lean so far into the survival part.
                >Honestly this game would be so much better if it didn't mean so far into the survival part.

After a few hours, your Pals start automating everything for you. All we do now is explore, do dungeons, capture more Pals, and fight bosses
                    How do I get them to stop ADD'ing out? They do a 1/10th of a task and then go do something else
                        lift them and throw them at the task you want them to do, you can see the task assigning to them when you hold the throw button
                        I've found that you need to get the Pals that can *only* do one or two things. If they can do everything, they'll try to do everything. Also, if you pick them up and throw them onto a task, it will assign them to it
                        Make sure to have clear pathways between tasks, chests and other spots they go to. There are very annoying hitboxes on few stuff you build that will block pathing and fuck with AI, also they care a lot about the way stuff is facing so don't build stations facing wall on 4th floor. 

On my 2nd playthrough(wanted to restart to try stuff out) I went straight away to big flat zone and built a lot of wooden floor before even placing my tablet.
            I wonder if the survival stuff can be modded out or turned off in the menus. I avoid survival crafting bs like it's a disease. But I love the idea of open world exploration with Pok√©mon like companion and guns... although I don't really want to shoot them.
                Killing Pals is the best part! Or putting them to work on your compound. 

You can host a server and change the hunger options and edit the game rules.
            This was me, downloaded and jumped in, within 15 minutes I got over-encumbered and thought, nah, I ain't doing this again.  I loved the idea of Pokemon with guns.  Can't be bothered with another survival game where you have to play for hours before you can do fun stuff
        Yeah ive wanted slavery for so long in pokemon of course.
            That's always been there? You catch a wild animal and force it to fight for you until it passes out from pain. How's that any different here?
                In Pokemon it was presented more as a "partnership" after the initial taming; in Palworld there is no ambiguity.
                    Partnership... Except for the hundreds of Pokemon you have sitting in stasis. 

Gotta catch em all, to sit in a void for all eternity? 

Dark as fuck.
                    Except for those two games that basically called it slavery...
                    It's not slavery because they like it  
They smile therefore it's not Stockholm syndrome

Pok√©mon games are weird man  
Even if they try to make it ambiguous and friendly, the whole concept has always been weird when you look at it 

Oh well, I'm having fun with palworld now
            Pok√©mon MASTER
    Are you saying that Pokemon is not slavery in itself?
        funny because this was the theme of Pokemon Black and white. Goated games imo and easily the peak of pokemon.
            People say that but they kinda immediately throw out that theme and it turns out the whole "free Pok√©mon" movement was just a conspiracy set up by the team rocket of that game and Pok√©mon actually like being subjugated or something.
        less so but it kinda is. pokemon is more like taming but yeah you could say it is also slavery as some are smarter.
        Yeah I don't get all this slavery nonsense in palworld. Was funny the first couple of times I heard it and now it's just annoying. I can't see how I'm treated any different to these pals by my government and Apparently I'm far from a slave
            wait until all of your pals have developed eating disorders and refuse to work, so you ceremoniously butcher one of them to send a message to the others
                If by ceremonically you mean merging all the shit pals into one pal, and then butchering that pal in front of them while they're eating breakfast
                Isn't that what employers basically do when staff are under performing in the real world? Threaten them with the sack which leads to no money which leads to starvation?
            People ruin their underwear over GTA6 but apparently this game has slavery in it even though all my guys got endless food and a jacuzzi to chill in
            I mean, you can literally capture humans and sell them so...

Edit: idk who down voted me, but I'm dead serious. Any NPC in game minus the tower bosses are capturable
                Well. Technically they are not humans and they are not on planet earth, it's just fantasy. they are just pixels and you can do this sort of stuff in loads of games. It isn't like the game forces you to do that you do it you are making them slaves out of your own will. Much worse goes on in games like rust and ark.¬†
                    I don't recall anyone saying you're forced to capture the NPCs? Just that you can, and given that they are shaped like a human, act like a human, and speak like a human, its relatively easy to compare it to slavery as a joke. Especially since the humans sell so damn well üòÇ 500 or so gold per. 

But really, you're taking a joke about the games mechanics a little personally. If you don't wanna capture the syndicate dudes and just wanna kill them, go for it. Play how you want to
            Bro, you are approaching the point. You are a wage slave. Read Anarchist literature and watch Zeitgeist Addendum & Zeitgeist Moving Forward. Trust me.
    A game can be literally perfect and still fail because of marketing. My question is HOW did Palworld just overtake CS2? I've never heard of this game, the OP never heard of this game, and other people in this thread never heard of it.

If this is legit, then they are a GENIUS level marketologist bigger than even PlayerUnknown. Where did these people come from if there was no real advertising or a campaign?
        I mean that's like asking how Lethal Company got popular when it was a single person project and got into steam's top 10 by concurrent players. Some games just get lucky and spread from person to person & get picked up by youtubers/tik-tok.

Success is 50% luck and 50% effort.
            I'd say more than 50% luck these days, especially when you're a solo dev with no spare money for advertising. Posts on reddit might get a few players but likely not enough to boost you into visibility, and twitter no chance unless you already had a following, which is unlikely for most people.
                You think getting one of the highest played games is luck? I dunno man. I would say the game needs to be pretty damn good.
                    No, I think regardless of effort if you're unlucky your game will go nowhere. You can have the greatest idea and solid execution, and it doesn't matter if nobody finds your game.  

The lethal companies of game releases are one in tens of thousands, if not more.
                        Maybe. Do you have any examples of really solid games that never got any traction?
                            Off the top of my head, no. That said, once the next steam next fest rolls around you could look at the steamdb charts for the majority of games that get featured there and you'll find that they either gained only a small temporary influx in sales, or none at all. That isn't to say that every game there is a gem to everyone because that's too subjective, but that many games that could be gems just never get the opportunity/exposure to get to that point.  

So yeah, I'm not saying these people put in no effort and don't deserve their game taking off, just that effort is not a guarantee and without the resources to make large advertising pushes (and even then) there is a significant chance that the game flies completely under the radar.
                                So you have a theory, but no evidence.

I don't completely disagree with you though. I do think some luck is involved as well, but imo the luck really comes down to finding a formula with broad appeal. There probably are solid games with low sales, but they probably don't have broad appeal.

In general though, I think that to even have a chance at being a highly played game, it's gotta be a damn good game.
                                    Steps To Getting Downvoted On Reddit

1. Locate a comment that is one (or more) of the following: an overgeneralization, an opinion presented as fact, or an unsupported conclusion

2. Request *any* form of evidence: data, examples, screenshots, tweets, literally anything

3. Once it is clear that no evidence can/will be provided, note that there does not seem to be evidence to support the initial claim.

4. lmaoooo get fucked asshole LOL substantiated claims are BORING and for fuckin' NERDS get out of here with your reasonable discourse

5. DAE feel like 2+2 actually = 5???
                            I can give you 3 - which of course are my subjective opinions (otherwise the games would be popular obviously lol)

Shadowrun (2007) Xbox/PC - one of the very first cross-platform FPS games, has a 'buy system' similar to CS:GO, and abilities like that of Overwatch or Valorant (teleport dash through wall/floor, place a tree of healing) 

\[personally, teleporting through walls in an FPS game in 2007 was so cool and revolutionary to me\]

- maybe it was just too ahead of its time, but apparently I just read that the servers are still live and running

Battleborn (2016) PS/Xbox/PC - I believe this to be the best example in terms of luck. They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms. It was a 5v5 team based game sort of like LoL in the sense of PvPvE where you can capture points to get AI to fight alongside you (I think that's how LoL works, at least) - but it was First Person, and the first time anything like this released on console.

- unfortunately for them, they released their game within 21 days of one of the most popular games of all time, Overwatch, so lots of direct comparisons were made between the 2 FPS games.. and only one survived in the end

Blazing Sails (2021) \[2023 official release\] PC - you show this game to a Sea of Thieves diehard and after 4 seconds they will call it a knockoff and dismiss it, which is what happened at the game's launch. I played SoT only a couple times, and while I admired the graphics and mechanics - I quickly lost interest after discovering that majority of the gameplay is PvE oriented, extremely repetitive, and lacks hardly any variables in the game (only 3 different guns, 1 melee weapon... this still stands true 6 years later)

(I am biased, I am not going to try to pretend otherwise lol) 

- this is why I was excited to come across Blazing Sails.. it is everything I wish SoT was. It removes the PvE aspect out of the game, leaving only fast paced PvP left. And most notably, the game is objectively 100x better in the area that has been SoT's #1 most well known issue for 6 years running now: Hit Registration. The game also launched with I believe around 12+ weapons, so it already had more depth in terms of variables (currently 21+ weapons) 

The hit reg in this game is one of the best I've seen in a game, which surprised me for an indie cartoon pirate game. I used to be active in the game's discord when it first came out and told the devs how good the hit reg was, especially in comparison to SoT.. and that it should be one of the main selling points

I believe it to be a combination of bad luck in terms of not gaining any traction, not having any big streamers play, as well possibly bad marketing in distinguishing themselves from SoT from the start. It is one of the few games I've seen on Steam that has a 90% rating, and nearly every negative review is about there being a lack of players, not the actual game itself.

Blazing Sails just released their official trailer a couple months ago, and the last line of it is "...so feast your eyes on an Indie game, so eye-watering, you'll mistake the work of one family of 4 in Belgium, for that of hundreds in a multi-national, AAA studio - then gasp in utter disbelief at which one actually delivers accurate hit reg"
                                > They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms.

Just wanted to say you reminded me of Monday Night Combat. A TPS-MOBA. I freaking loved that game!
                                    dude.. what!?- how have I never seen that game?

I just watched some videos, and that looks way ahead of its time.. idk how I haven't seen that before :o
                                Yeah, there's definitely games that are overhyped and there's definitely games that are underhyped, and luck definitely IS a part of it...

The problem is that the entire conversation is sort of hamstrung by the fact that "Luck" is such a nebulous concept. Like, we all more or less know what we mean by "luck", except there's a lot of real-world complexity that the word "luck" hand-waves away--albeit unintentionally.

To use a recent example, is it luck that Lies of P was such an unexpected smash hit yet Lords of the Fallen had an ambivalent, mostly lukewarm reception? 

Sort of? But what do i/we mean by "luck" in this instance, right? We're not just saying "oh yeah, it's a total dice roll"... Realistically, the "luck" came from the fact that Lies of P was a unique blend of ideas (Fairy Tale x Souls), part of it came from the fact that it was--in many people's estimation--the first game to go toe-to-toe with FromSoft's combat design. 

And so there's a luck factor to that: Because Lies of P came out a couple weeks prior to LotF, people perhaps evaluated LotF more critically than they would have if Lies of P hadn't come out at all. 

But IS that luck? Hard to say, because there were a million-billion decisions made along the way that led to the outcome that we now might refer to as "lucky" or "unlucky"

Idk, not really agreeing or disagreeing, just find it an interesting topic.
                        The mentality that everything comes down to luck is cope. Success is earned.
        For me a trailer popped up on YouTube like 2 years ago and I've had it wishlisted ever since. Sometimes a concept and timing is all you need for word of mouth to take over.
        So, I came across this game about 4 years ago. I can't even remember how ( maybe YouTube), but I had no idea if it was ever going to come to light. Over the past few years, I have seen 2 trailers. I just happened to hop on Steam yesterday, and it dropped in early access. I dropped what I was doing because I got so excited.
        It got shown years ago and I think almost everyone forgot.
        Its just leeching of a big franchise, in a hopefully good way. Not that surprising really. the idea is good enough that itll just get traction if you show it to big people. 

Pokemons simply appeal to quite a few people because of how cute they look, the gameplay has also a variety that will appeal to a broad set of people.
            No, I get it. Im just surprised that the game is THIS popular while a small proportion of reddit users know what it is. Also, it's paid so that drastically increases the entry floor, unlike dota 2, and CS2 which used to dominate the chart until this game came out
                Im guessing streamers because this game seems to be the perfect type of game to stream. its cute and has a lot to play around with.
                I've seen three posts about it in the last 24 hours. There's your marketing. Wouldn't be surprised if some percentage of these posts are from the marketing team themselves.
        I have had pal world wishlisted for years and have followed it closely. Speak for your self....
        I'd assume it got quite a bit of exposure from being Day 1 on GamePass. I saw the trailer from Xbox account marketing this game.
        They aren't marketing genious. Video game industry is dead. It is how braindead consumers buy games nowaday. And streamers.   


Most popular games are just empty shells made to milk money from dumbfucks. It's just one of these honkai, genshin, now you have palwords.   


Welcome to modern day, when only video game with 0 interest made with 0 effort. Wich wouldn't have event touch internet culture back in early 2000 now is worldwid success.   


People are zombies who really really like to eat hot turds. Do not respect people, they do not deserv it.
    Slavery???? Maybe I will give it a try.....
    The confederate dream.
    So like America right?
        Lol slavery existed in all areas at certain points in time
            Still exists in Africa today
        Yeah, the Philippines too bud
        We can see why it appeals to people eh?
        I guess you skipped History class (unless your country's schools don't offer history classes, if so, my condolences).
    Ah, so modded RimWorld but it's 3D?
        No
    That's so cool it's on my wishlist.
    You. Can. Catch. People. Make. Them. Work. Or. Sell. Them. On. The. Black. Market.
    Pokemon is already slavery
        Yes but more. Factory sweatshops and you can eat them.
            Also you can capture actual people in palworld
                what? lol

players or NPCs?
                    NPCs. There's no pvp
                        what do NPCs do? are there fixed settlements or are they just other survivors or how does that work?  I find the steam page description rather lacking
                            You can make them a camp slave or make them fight for you like a Pok√©mon. Or you can sell them for a good price to the black market trader.
            lol what?
                Yes that‚Äôs right
        DAE
    Wait, isn't the slavery part already included with Pok√©mon?
    [deleted]
        what would you call it? You can literally have monsters, that you capture with balls, which you can put in your pocket (pocket monsters so to speak, aka pokemons), fight for you, while using guns yourself.
        Lol dude is getting mad at people innocently describing a game
It's worth noting that you can customize the world like other great sandboxy games. Like, if you don't like survival that much, you can literally just turn off Hunger and Stamina, and even multiply how many resources you get.

Especially multiply how many Pals spawn in the world so there can literally be massive herds all over the place. It is also intriguing to see the Pals get into fights with each other. I just saw a big higher level Pal destroy like 20 smaller ones because they accidently enraged it lol.
You know when you‚Äôre scrolling on a website and you see an absolutely insane ad for a game and it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúCKICK HERE TO PLAY NOW!!l‚Äù and you know it‚Äôs a scam.

Well this game is like those ads, but real. It‚Äôs absolutely nuts.

        Buying it as a joke. That's some good stuff
            I'll probably play it.  But I definitely bought it because they went out of their way to make it happen, so I feel like they should reap the rewards.
            It's no joke though, it's actually pretty decent. I mostly enjoy the potion mixing game.
        haha my wif bought this one, its awesome! I reaaallly wanted to play those games, but i'd never ever download those pieces of junk on my phone.
            >but i'd never ever download those pieces of junk on my phone.

Then maybe you miss the joke, which is that the game never actually is the one in the ad.  So you download something totally different that isn't what you wanted to play.  This steam game is actually all the games in the ads that are fake games to get you to download.
        I need to get that one day lol
        I own this and it's great. Wish they'd add a bit more and tweak some of the controls. Otherwise I love it.
        Saving this one lmao
    in a good way or bad?
        From what I've heard from a friend who plays the game, good. It apparently is basically Ark with Pokemon.
            It gives me cube world vibes which i deeply miss.. it looks adorable
                When my penguins haul my wood around they balance it on their head and just kind of bounce around my camp with it. It's adorable and my wife and I are having a blast
                It is adorable. You can actually interact with your Pals and their reactions are so damn cute! It makes you feel even worse for making them work in the quarries or slaughtering the rest of their species :c
        Really good! I fucking hate survival games. I started Friday and have played 15 hours on a work weekend. The slavery aspect takes away so much of the busy work with survival games. You need ore? Send that MFing seal to the mine it's great
        It's brilliant.i bought it thinking I'll try it out and refund before two hours. I played it for 6 hours straight and I've never done that with a game before. Time just melts away. And it's cute.
        I easily got 30 bucks worth of fun the first night I played it, and I haven't even joined my friends server yet.
        In a good way. Progression is honestly fun and exploration is cool
Really wish the success of Palworld would set a fire under Game Freak and Nintendo's asses. Make them actually put quality first again instead of churning out games just because they sell, for now.

But I also know it just won't. At least not yet.
    The thing is, Pok√©mon games keep selling like they're the best thing ever made. So it's definitely not gonna change anytime soon.
        while being the most average thing ever made
            Even average games run above 20 FPS and don't rip out features with each iteration.
                Yeah same deal with the FiFAs and CODs, can just push out any garbage when you have a mindless horde buying everything¬†
                    Because despite what a lot of people might want to believe, 80% of the Pokemon playerbase are under the age of 14 and have barely any reference to how good the game should be, let alone whether the game is actually any good or not.

When you're a kid any game can be good...
                        Not true, the younger generation is almost, if not more, obsessed with retro games now than ever before with help from youtube. It's one of the reasons the old pokemon games won't drop in value, despite having a bazillion copies each, because the newer generations want to re buy gameboys/ds and play those games they missed out on that us adults keep saying were the best.

And God forbid Nintendo re releases them on Switch and make themselves an insurmountable fortune with the profits they'd make.
                [deleted]
                    Yep, I didn't even buy S/V because it's just such unexcusable dogshit. They then admitted it, after the outrage, and instead of fixing the game, released dlc....bruh. They have zero reason to make the game better so I'll just be sad and not buy their games anymore. I know it doesn't make a difference but there are SO many games that come out that are more worth my time and money
                        [deleted]
                            When the spin offs on gamecube have better animations and frame rate then games on the switch, you'd think they'd actually start caring about the quality control. 

It's just such a sad fall from grace seeing every game get worse and worse. Hopefully Nintendo starts spreading the license around more. Until then I'll keep enjoying actual good games like bg3 lol
                I almost think they made exp share mandatory out of spite.¬†
            Average is a huge compliment to those games
        Which is so sad. I quit playing after Sun and Moon because quality consistently went down starting with X and Y. I‚Äôve owned every gen since gen 2 and was hoping I‚Äôd one day gift every pokemon I owned to any kids I had.
        They have two options:


Spend $80m and sell 20 million copies at $40 each


Put in extra effort, spend $200m and sell 20 million copies at $40 each
            As someone who work in IT. It is hillarious to witness people asking nintendo to make effort. When they created the franchise. The franchise never was to be a story arc extension from extension. It's more like an entry rpg for children and every iteration is addressed to new children, no to 50 yo manchild who played them all.  
You can't even have a grasp on the very existence of the ip but anyway...  


So these Nintendo evil guys are the one puting 0 effort in their game. But on the other hand. Palworld, ripping everything from mechanics, to UI to artistic direction are the one putting in the effort. I guess the climax of these effort were made when they were feeding the pokemon games to their IA.   


Fucking tool. And I'm not a pokemon fan. Fuck pokemon, you're supposed to play one of their game and that's it. Fuck "gamers". Fuck "video game" industry. And all of you enjoying palworlds should commit suicide. You are enjoying the worst turd ever created since NFT games.
                Buying two copies of Palworlds now due to this post. Thanks for the suggestion.
    It'll set a fire under them.

For their lawyers.

I'm sure Game Freak is going to try and pull something out of their ass, about the game infringing on their IP or something. It'll be unlikely to go anywhere, but like you said this probably won't cause much change with GF for now. Especially since I doubt if, assuming the game's full release does really well, Nintendo would still let it get ported to whatever system they have at the time.
        They're not going to sue them since they're not directly ripping the assets off. Yes a good chunk of the pals look a lot like existing pokemon designs but that's not enough of a sway in the Japanese court. If you think Nintendo/TPCi will sue all creature collecting games that gets slightly popular then we would have long heard that they have long sued the likes of Digimon, Yokai Watch, Temtem, Nexomon, Neopets, etc. 

Only those romhacks like Pokemon Uranium gets the letter from the lawyers since those are directly using Nintendo / TPCi assets as it features actual Pokemon IP at the game.
            Plus you can capture humans in Palworld. Can‚Äôt do that in Pok√©mon
        I doubt it... creature collecting games are a genre on Steam now. 

Are consumers likely to get confused when purchasing Palworld? It's a survival game with guns. Some of the monsters are similar but are they going to argue in court that a leaf monkey was a rip off of a fire monkey in a different game? Idk.. just doesn't seem like it would hold up in court.

Most game devs have lawyers that they consult on this type of thing so I think it's fine. Temtem is more like Pokemon than Palworld.
    I don't know if the reason is because of the quality of their current games. I think the main issue is that you can't play a pok√©mon game unless you have a Nintendo switch, or any Nintendo console. The success of Palworld could be all of those gamers who do not have access to buy a Pokemon game.
        Accessibility is not the issue, this much is clear. The real issue is gamefreak and their mismanagement of the game. 

Not enough devs, not enough time, not enough budget. BoTW/ToTK/MPRemake/MarioOddysey are all good games with good graphics that sold well and run perfectly fine most of the time.

Pokemon has is the one major franchise partly owned by Nintendo to not run well and not even because of the graphics. Not to mention its outsold palworld multiple times I've despite being on switch alone.

BDP sold 15m~ copies. Palworld has around 3m~ from what im seeing, this ofcourse is likely to increase within the coming months. Within 6 months is probably the best time to compare these numbers since that's what the source for bdsp said it took to reach 15m.

This still makes it very clear, it being a console exclusive isn't the issue.
            Gamefreak really struggled with the transition to 3D and to the Switch. Their other Switch games (unrelated to Pokemon) also run poorly in many cases. Somewhere there‚Äôs an alternate universe where they stuck with high-quality 2D (like Octopath), but that still doesn‚Äôt address the other game design issues.

I do think some of SV‚Äôs sales were boosted by the SwSh DLC and Arceus. Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra both brought in interesting features that fans enjoyed and it seemed like they were listening to players. Arceus was also an interesting refresh of the formula (didn‚Äôt land for everyone, but it was something that added a lot of neat features like catching pokemon outside of combat).¬†

So I certainly expected that SV would continue that trend. Sadly, it did not, especially since some of the concepts were a good idea just very flawed in execution.
                Yeah, I kinda wish they returned to 2D in a similar vein to octopath, but that's never gonna happen at this rate.

Although I do think we still have a chance to see another Legends game which I want to see.
                    Legends Arceus was the only game that actually justified the jump to 3D instead of being 3D just because. 

Arceus was revolutionary for a Pokemon game, but compared to the jumps other franchises have made, it's rather tame and half baked.
            To back up your point, you could also use Scarlet/Violet as a comparison, which came out more recently. It has sold over 23m copies and was Nintendo's biggest launch ever (10m sales in 3 days).
            Fair point and good resourceful info. Thank you for your reply.
Hallo, I edited some of my comment history to prevent scraping. Yes I know reddit gets regularly cached, it's something you sign in when you type on a forum, it's still better than nothing and will make digging through these a lot less convenient! All platforms die yadda yadda.

Good luck if you have an account here and you're reading this.
    Crazy, as much as I'm into video games, this is the first time I've heard of it.¬†
        I remember seeing alpha gameplay on Twitter like a millennia ago and I assumed it would never actually come out.
        definitely feels like they really only marketed it starting like a week before early access release
        It's cool, I hadn't heard about it until like 3 days ago either. I've also never played a survival or Pokemon game, so I guess it makes sense. I did end up buying it though cuz a bunch of people in my clan and Steam friends list bought it. I played for about 3 hours last night before I had to go to sleep and I was really enjoying it. Looking forward to starting to play it again today very soon.
        A lot of YouTubers have been playing it lately too. 

I‚Äôm always skeptical when YouTubers who are known to do paid reviews or plays start pushing a game.
uve got ark players who are desperate for a new game and pokemon players who are desperate for a good game, and there alot of players who are in both of those groups
    Picked it up last night knowing almost nothing about it (because a friend invited me to co-op). It's definitely Pokemon ARK. It's hella fun with friends. No idea how the single player mode will hold up.
        I‚Äôve played by myself because my friends would rather watch than join in (even though it‚Äôs only $20ish!). Still pretty fun, though I imagine it takes a lot more time to accomplish things.
            [deleted]
                You‚Äôre right! Gonna have to let em know.
                    The gamepass version is not compatible with steam version right now. It‚Äôs 3 months outdated.
                You pay for gamepass, it's not free on gamepass.

Free on gamepass would be if it were a free trial of gamepass, which they are much stricter about now.
        Since you can adjust most settings, you can make solo not so painful and keep the fun you'd have in coop, just without the other players
    You‚Äôre the first person I‚Äôve seen mention Ark. 30 seconds into the game and I felt it was like Ark.
        ive never actually played palword but its very obviously got ark influence. U catch creature make creature stronger make little base, in ark u catch dinosaur make dinoasaure stronger make little base
Im enjoying the collecting of creatures, the automation you can do with them, and the survival aspects of the game.

Later on breeding will become the end game.

Its brought ark and factorio into one game with a fun art style
    The game is incredibly fun but people need to stop comparing the automation to Factorio.
        Yeah no one cares
            I do because I want the game to commit to the automation parts better earlier on in base development. Like let me set shit like spheres to just produce an infinite amount at workbenches so that they‚Äôll be made whenever the resources are available.
                This! And a filter for chests... God I hate when my Pals put a pile of wood and stone in EVERY chest in my base...
            I do because that's completely misrepresenting what the game actually is...
Making a Pokemon/Survival/RTS/Third Person Shooter seems to have paid off.  Pokemon with guns and a survival game where the tediom of collecting everything is negated by having npcs do it for you sound like a winner.
The game reminds me a lot of pokemon arceus. With that being said, many people are hungry to play a pokemon like game on PC.
    I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as simple as people want to play Pokemon on PC, there‚Äôs loads of games that do that. Nexomon, Coromon, Cassette Beasts, Tem Tem, Monster Harvest etc‚Ä¶

I think it‚Äôs just that it takes Pokemon and Survival Games and pushes it to the absurd. Like Pokemon with guns and you can force them to work, like the concept was so ridiculous I knew from trailer 1 I was going to buy this regardless because I had to experience it for myself even if it sucked.
        Making the Pals work is something that should be more common in the Pok√©mon games, we already know that's how that world works, but they don't ever really lean into it.
            We always play as a child in the pokemon games.
                But we rarely see mons working in the world,not just for the protagonist. Every so often we might see Machamp being used for construction, but given what the creatures can do, the Pok√©mon world should look like the Flintstone world, where the creature's abilities are used in everyday life.
            Yeah, iirc there has onely been one gen where you can make your boxed pokemon "work" is in gen 7 with the poke pelago. Strangely enough it never returned, like many other things in pokemon.
Lotttaaaaaa downvoted opinions in here lmao. Some true facts too, it‚Äôs definitely having a popularity boost from twitch and social media you‚Äôd be silly to deny that. It‚Äôs mixing alot of mechanics from different games people love so , yeah it‚Äôs gonna catch a broad audience 

Personal opinion , it‚Äôll be amazing once it‚Äôs finished I‚Äôm not stricken just yet but it‚Äôs not like they lie to you it says upfront it‚Äôs early access
    I don't think people are downvoting those comments because they think they're wrong, more because they're incredibly obvious and pointless to point out in the first place. In what universe does any game ever get big without a boost on social media, twitch, youtube etc?

Among Us for example is a game that wasn't particularly huge until it got a massive boost from people playing it on YouTube and Twitch. Elden Ring for example was also huge on twitch and youtube, but that was because so many people were playing it that naturally streamers and youtubers were too. League of Legends is still one of the most streamed games on Twitch, but is that advertising or is it just because a lot of people play league of legends and want to watch other people play it too?

It just feels so petty and unnecessary to go "oh it's because everyone on social medias are talking about it while youtubers and streamers play it all the time" like yeah... that's how popular games tend to go. Gaming journalists will write about currently trending games and content creators tend to make content about currently trending games. It'd be insanely weird if Palworld had 1 million current players but no relevancy on social medias or youtube/twitch.
        Yeah but in this case palworld had very little to  almost no marketing the whole time. It only got popular because it's a solid game and people on twitch and other socials showed off the game and its a fairly cheap price point.
    I'm fine with it "ending" or being able to "beat it" eventually. I can't have every game I play be the type of game where I have to log in at least once or twice a week to do whatever new stuff is available, like in Destiny 2. 

For the ~30 bucks they the game costed, I'm fine if I get maybe a couple hundred hours out of the game, beat all the content the game has to offer, and stop playing for a while until they release a big content update or something, which I'm sure they'll do every once in a while since it's still in Early Access.
    Part of the downvoted comments are just people mindlessly hating and just saying "kids lmao"

the other part of the downvoted comments are the ones trying to bring up drama that nobody cares about.

The reality is that the vast majority of the consumer base in ANY industry are massive casuals.

They don't go to reddit to talk about games. They don't look up reviews. They don't investigate drama surrounding a company. 

They just care about whether or not the game is fun.

--------------------

You have a ton of people trying to create drama surrounding this game regarding the CEO's opinion on AI, the so called plagiarism of pokemon and how the company MIGHT have employed AI to create things, but the reality?

Most people don't give a shit, and rightfully so.

Life is too stressful already for most of us. I come home from work and I sit down to play this game with my friends, and we all have fun doing it. That is all I care about.
    Hasn't it been early access for like 4 years and the devs say it will be at least another year? üò¨
        Hmmm I don‚Äôt think so , it was announced in 2021 but it literally just became public early access like 2 days ago
I figured it would blow up. It was teased a few years ago and people went absolutely nuts for the teaser. Obviously didn't predict it would blow up THIS much, as the teasers didn't gain an insane amount of traction. But considering it's an indie game I was quite impressed at the reactions I saw to the teaser even on reddit. It's a no brainer as to why it's a success, just didn't predict it would hit #1 on steam charts.
Well the idiots over at Nintendo not doing what fans want.
    The fans still buy it and complain about it.
        two different groups
            Well I‚Äôm in both. Not anymore though. I can‚Äôt be f‚Äôed to play the second half of SV DLC. It not fun. I won‚Äôt be buying the next game if it‚Äôs as crappy. Guess I‚Äôll only be I. The complaining group then.
    >Nintendo not doing what fans want

My dude, Scarlet and Violet didn't "do what the fans want" and sold over 23 million copies. Sword and Shield was the original dexit gen and sold 26 million copies. 

I definitely have issues with how Nintendo/GameFreak treats the pokemon franchise, but at the end of the day I think people have to recognize that it's an absolute juggernaut of a franchise that's primarily aimed towards children. There's no way they jeopardize that by giving Pikachu a gun.
Cause its a pokemon game with building and fighting and flying and shooting and scooting and booting and
    Tooting
People in this thread just proving that Pok√©mon fans can't see a similar game without having a fuckin stroke.
It's just a fun survival game, Pok√©mon , I love it!  I can entertain myself for hours with it!
Survival

Micromanagement

Breeding

Base building

Collecting

Multi player

Chill vibes

&#x200B;

.. In 1 game, sign me up!
Because it's fun
It's the pokemon game Nintendo would never create, and with graphics, Nintendo only dreams of. So yeah...
    Honestly that sounds fun. Sometime Nintendo games are too neutered.

Edit: downvoted for such a tame comment. Fanboys gonna fanboy
        it's pretty fun! I've played the cracked version for a bit, but I'll wait for the full released. I can't with early access games anymore.
        femboys gonna femboy
Pok√©mon Legends mixed with Ark.
Pok√©mon ark rust‚Ä¶thats why
tons of people love pokemon  
tons of people also love survival open world  
it's on multiple platforms  
it's on gamepass  
promoted very heavily on social media  
leading to lots of streamer playing the game
It's pretty addicting, it scratches a lot of itches and appeals to a wide demographic. And that contributes to the high concurrent player count. People can get sucked in for 6 hours so easily, also I wouldn't be surprised if lots of them are just idling.
This is a fairly complex topic, but long story short: Steam has a "type" of a prevalent player, just like Nintendo consoles, PlayStation, Xbox etc. https://howtomarketagame.com/2022/04/18/what-genres-are-popular-on-steam-in-2022/ Nintendo players like elegant, refined, gameplay-centric games. PlayStation players like high-end graphics and story. What do Steam players like? It may seem intuitive to think "everything", but actually no - people on Steam who play many games mostly choose games with **combat, survival, crafting and building**. And if a game has all of it, executed well - you have a hit.
    Lol elegant refined gameplay centric games.
        Eh, I get what they‚Äôre driving at. SM64 is kind of the archetype for this. That game is pretty mechanically barebones compared to the average modern AAA game or even a newer 3D Mario game, and there‚Äôs not a ton going on plot-wise. What is there is so polished and well-made that it set the standard for high-quality 3D platforming, and still holds up pretty well almost 30 years later.
        Did Nintendo write that? Lol
        Is it not? I'm not a Nintendo fan, but they do seem to prioritize tight controls in all their games. Odyssey's Mario feels silky smooth to control, but the story is just... Is it even there?

Botw as well. Everyone loved the physics and the exploration but you'd be hard-pressed someone who liked the main story lol
        Nintendos first party titles are the definition of refined gameplay. Nintendo has literally held on the ballsacks of gamers since the NES. Anyone much like yourself who think otherwise forget the fact that Pokemon isn‚Äôt developed in house and GameFreak is not in fact a Nintendo developer. They are 3rd party. 

Name me any in house first party Nintendo Franchise that isn‚Äôt highly acclaimed and loved across the board?
            Sure buddy, sure.
                Keep being butthurt buddy. Keep being butthurt üòÇ
        Gamefreak? No. Nintendo? Yes.
        I think Nintendo treats their fans like shit, but their games do usually have good gameplay.
Pokemon is the 3rd best selling franchise, mix in some shooting, open world and a big of Minecraft, now you have appealed to the whole gaming world basically.

Also most other open world games are not very high quality.
    Third on what list? All franchises like McDonald's or? It's the number 1 media franchise.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises
        Dude the Gap between 1st and 2nd it's huge wft
            Gotta catch em all (all the $$$, that is)
It's Pok√©mon, Breathe of the Wild, and Ark, all fused together. Those are three extremely popular games, I would be surprised if the game wasn't blowing up.
Pokemon tends to focus on their target demographic, and most of us who grew up with it are way aged out of it now, so a game aiming to be Pokemon for grownups has a target audience built right in.
Pokemon style game on the PC. Its also really well done and runs well and quite addictive.
In all fairness it's a really good game... Could care a less about other people's game comparisons.
For me it was Ark Ascension have shit performance. This game satisfies my Ark hubger.
    Same, dropped ark with frustration after having 30 hours played, got frustrated of the bugs, the crashes to desktop, losing my tame to a lvl 30 alpha raptor. This game relieves me from all those frustating moments from day one and it performs better in every aspect.
Youre able to capture other humans and make them pals, and you can butcher pals... soooo, closet serial killers?
    I didn't realize you could capture humans. I had a few raid my base too.
It‚Äôs fun and surprisingly good quality for being early access. Idk what else you want people to say
It is basically a survival pokemon game and it plays decently well for a game that just released in early access. It is a setting that is incredibly starved for good games and new innovation, especially on the PC. 

&#x200B;

I haven't bought it yet since it just launched in early access but I will almost certainly do it later this year some time.
This was a highly anticipated game as far as indie projects go, I'm honestly surprised you've never heard of it.
Because its a cool concept and actually turned out to be fun.
[deleted]
    The sub is getting absolutely slammed by shills right now. Look at how many people who have never participated here are making threads about the player numbers.
it is a monster collection game with base building, some base defense and if you get to a high enough base level effectively automation. 

It also seems the marketing was effectively "pokemon with guns" though you have to be lvl 36 to gain access to the first type of gun which will take hours if not days. After it came out it changed to word of mouth of "Pokemon with guns and slavary" as you can and most times should kill them when they slack off to be replaced by another. The why is they will just do it again and again.
    You get a musket at like level 20-21 though, no?
    Also there is like no gore, so everyone can stream it without issues and make content,

also it being open world means content creators make their own drama which can be endless.

and personally, no performance issues,crashes or game breaking bugs which is rare these days.
    I‚Äôm level 22 with 3 types of guns?
        Level 26 here with a pokemon on my head with a gun lol
It's ARK Survival with not-copywrited Pokemon. And it succeeded in whatever media push got people buying and spreading the word.  


It's nothing special at all.  


As of now, ARK Survival is now 232.78GB to download, so it might appeal to those who played the game, but uninstalled and are unwilling to devote their bandwidth and storage to that ever growing bloat monster.  


IMO, unfortunately, I bet that the playerbase will die hard in the next couple weeks to a couple months, leaving Pocketpair with (1,121,226 \* 27) over 30 million dollars with which to support the game over the next year, then probably give minimal updates for the next 3, then quit development while in early access.
    Btw there‚Äôs a new ark though, made in unreal engine 5. Way better graphics and it‚Äôs like 80 gigs, but in some cases is unstable as fuck and tends to crash. I hadn‚Äôt had any issues though and even I with a 1660Ti could run it (which for ark is wild). But yeah just letting you know ark is not that storage hungry anymore (for now). 

Also if you didn‚Äôt know it existed and are interested in ark then check it out, it has new features in comparison to the original one, like crossplatform modding and so on.
People like Pokemon + it's the closest thing to Breath of the Wild on Steam.
An entire generation of people grew up on Pokemon, Digimon and that weird frenchime with the pills. Palworld is like Ark + Pokemon with Legend of Zelda aesthetic.


It was a winning recipe. We‚Äôre all starved for a game like this.
"How is it so popular if MYSELF have never played it and never heard of it???"  


op is an idiot
I'ts a amazing and nice polished for a EA. Quite fun to play
Why are people going completely fucking stupid over Stanley cups? People do dumb shit.
    Right? I prefer Stanley's Bucket. :D
I tried it a little bit last night, I will probably get a few more hours on it to make a decision if i like it or not. It is your typical base building game with crafting and you get pokemon like creatures.
You can just check it out and refund before 2 hours. Its pretty fun pokemon meets ark kind of game
its a better  pocket monster game then the current pokemon because Nintendo doesn't know how to be adventurous anymore
Honestly I don't get it. It feels like an off brand ark with a layer of Pokemon and memes smeared all over it. I have it not quite 2 hours and refunded. 

It's 2024. I have played way to many survival games with clunky interfaces and Weird progression.

And the Pokemon like gameplay is just overall worse then temtem and other poke like games.

So the only thing that might get my interests is the meme worthiness, but aside from a few silly clips I have seen pop up... It seems like it's really just slavery and guns... Ok? Not exactly content I am going out of my way for.
It is a simple answer, look at the evolution from the first pokemon game to the last. Palworld brings active combat, lile Diablo did 25 uears ago. While Nintendo make great games like Zelda and Xenoblade Chronicles, the Pokemon games are far behind.
Because its fun as hell to anyone older than 15
Pokemon x Genshin = 2 things Steam never had until now. Sprinkle in some Ark, and boom 4 million plus purchases and 1 million daily players.
It's popular solely because people have no morality and rather be blind to the obvious and lie to themselves in order to do what they want.  
They don't care that they use designs that are clearly stolen from Game Freak. They don't care that the game is basically doing what they all got mad about a few weeks ago when they saw that there are developers that copy paste premade models in to their games.   
Now all of a sudden nobody cares anymore. You are all sad sacks of shite and are all progressively contributing to the downfall of the quality standard we want in our games.  
You can all complain about p2w games but still you buy it, even that fucktard Asmon is against it but still buys it on stream. You can't get much more of a fucking idiot in my eyes than that.  


If you really can't figure out why people are mad about this and how this will throw a shadow over games to come, when IP's can just be hauled through an AI blender and called their own, you are the fucking problem.  


&#x200B;

"ooh but i'm having fun you're just a pok√©mon fanboy that's salty"  
No, guess fucking what, I didn't like the last 2 pok√©mon games either but their designs ARE THEIR OWN CREATIONS.   
Palworld developers have no shame and you can "like" the game or whatever, still means you're a fucking cunt.
People in the comments saying this game blows Pok√©mon completely out of the water are either super delusional, or just don‚Äôt know what they are talking about. In terms of genres, Palworld could not be any farther from Pokemon than it is right now. The only semblance the two games have with one another is the ability to capture creatures. The combat system is extremely rudimentary, especially that the Pokemon serve little more than MMO Pets/Minecraft wolves and are pretty much solely autonomous fighting machines meant to aid you in combat rather than being pets you command and control. The base building system is not as in depth nor as complex as other survival games, even for being in early access. There are some mechanics blatantly ripped off from other games as well, not that this is a problem. This game is little more than ARK with pokemon creatures, to call it pokemon with guns is extremely misleading and disingenuous to the nature of what the game truly is. Lastly don‚Äôt get me started with the devs, who have a history of releasing games in half-baked states only to basically abandon their projects some time down the line. What makes you think this game is different? Its a game with imho a very unimpressive gimmick that has taken the world by storm because Pokemon and the creature collecting genre is one that is highly coveted and enjoyed by gamers everywhere.
It's Pokemon: WTF is a kilometer ü¶Öü¶Öü¶Ö
so i am all for people being annoyed at gamefreak who aren't putting any effort in the pokemon games like they used to, but i personally wouldn't wanna support this game either from what i have seen and read. 

This dev has previous track of leaving their games behind like their previous game craftopia is still in early access even after 4 years now despite them promising to fix and update the game.

The pals in the game are ai generated based on pokemon promts (the ceo of the company has posts and discussions about using generative ai to create new pokemon you couldn't tell were fake and using ai to bypass copyright.)

Many of the huds like cold/hot meters, wanted meters, etc, are directly cut and paste of botw and rdr2, respectively. Most of the survival aspects and ui is directly lifted from ark and packed in an early access unreal asset flip of a game.
Mixes a few gameplay loops that work. It‚Äôs cheap and addicting. People are getting into it through word of mouth, and a lot of people are playing it on saturday night so the numbers are peaking. It won‚Äôt last, but the game is fun.
Good character creation, fun survival gameplay, pokemon, exploration, tech trees, fleshed out. 

But most importantly, it's just a fun game
Because everyone wants a Pokemon game that was actually made with some effort, since gamefreak is uncapable to do it
i got a refund after playing for a few hours and I truly dont understand the appeal
people use this game to shit on nintendo as if palworlds company isn't just as scummy
kids wanted a pokemon-like game and they got one. 

Let's move on and let them enjoy it I guess
    You actually tried it? I thought the same before because I hate survival games with all parts of my body but this game is kinda different
    Yeah exactly,  holy shit this thread is going off the rails lol
it was hyped for years so no surprise
    Apart from 1 trailer at TGA, majority never heard of it.
        fair most of my friends and discord groups i am in were raving about it for years so i assumed it was mostly known :)
            Aha yeah I had never heard of it until it released, but I've been having a good time with it
                My friends and I played Craftopia before PalWorld was announced and that was a shit ton of ridiculous fun (I fully recommend it, don't listen to those that say it's been EA for 3+ years as being a bad thing). Then we saw PalWorld and we were hyped about that game ever since!
Its literally the copy of various games into one. Ark + pokemon is just a scratch because are most popular. You have lots of Kenshi (base automatiom + ancient tech hunting). Also overall map and pal system has Dragons Dogma vibes.

Its just a very silly cluster* which worked somehow.
Just wait a month and see if the game has any staying power honestly. 

At the moment it could very much be a game that was hit with the hype because of ‚Äúpokemon with guns‚Äù which has been memed on since its reveal. 

That paired with curiosity and being the ‚Äúnew hip thing‚Äù similar to Lethal Company, Among Us, and whatnot.. of course every streamer and youtuber is gonna hop on that bandwagon to get more views, which then has all their followers gain interest and want to try what the hype is.. and now we are here with people asking why it‚Äôs hyped up. 

The game could be actually good, or just flavor of the month which is why I‚Äôm waiting for the hype and rose filled glasses to come out and I can bet your bottom dollar we will see floods of posts with people and their valid criticisms. As of now speaking ANYTHING negative about the game hits you with downvotes from the hive mind without a second thought.
it will pass, I've seen this hype before.
Because streamers love having new content which in turn drives sales.
    Yeah it doesn't seem to have any sort of content to it other than just pokemon but with guns. I don't see it sticking around
        You played it? It's already sold millions of times on day one and many people never watch twitch from these buyers.
        What do you mean it dosent have content? I've been playing it a lot with plenty more to do without much of a grind too, unless you are some god gamer and a luck lod beating every boss with the basic bow and catching each with the first ball i doubt many people have finished the current content yet
It's the streamer bait game of the month, they gave keys to big streamers a day or two before it went on sale.
    You played it?
Because it‚Äôs an awesome game.
    Wait until you read about the company and generative ai art usage.
        Why dont you elaborate?
            The company I guess also launched a game called craftopia that‚Äôs been in EA for 3 years and slightly abandoned. The art for the pals is generative a.i. look it up yo lol. Like the games fun. But I have a feeling after a few days the honey moon phase and immense copy paste and lack of depth and content will take its toll and people will be quite bored by the end of the week once they start to peel back the curtain and realize how shallow the content is.
                Do you even look into anything you're saying? Craftopia is still very much supported. Was updated last month even. Also a separate dev team than Palworld. The AI I don't know much about but not sure why that would be an issue if true.  These games aren't meant to be played forever. You soak up all the content and move on to something else. Check back in in six months or a year and do another play thru with new content. Rinse and repeat
                    I will likely never understand people expecting infinite replayability from every game, most games are good to complete once and be done or maybe pick up much later to give it another run through.
Not a single original concept in the whole game, completely derivative.

But the way they put the pieces together is just something else
    >But the way they put the pieces together is just something else

not really. But the way they put the pieces together is just something else

craftopia game is not the best and has many problems. Pal is full of red flags.  
But nothing surprises me if starfield was popular, or the day before.
        I got my money's worth of entertainment already and I haven't even left the starting zone yet. If they don't abandon it, that's just going to keep adding value to my 26 dollar purchase. To me, joy is worth more than a "perfect" game.
            I know that. This is why most game developers have stopped trying to make good games. 3.5 years ago they released a survival game with the "pokeball" mechanics in early access. That game is still on EA, and yet they released palworld, another survival game with "pokeballs" on EA.
Nintendo has shoveled out sub par Pokemon installments every year for many years.


Suddenly comes along a game that looks good, plays well, and feeds the hunger for a Pokemon game that's not technically shitty. And on PC and other platforms as well.


I'm not surprised at all.
Have you played it? I was playing with a couple friends.  It's soo much fun.
Pok√©mon, moistcritikal , front page steam banner, top of steam charts, friends talking about it‚Ä¶
I was going to get it because I need a survival game in my life, but I think I will wait for Enshrouded to come out in a couple days, it seems to have better survival and base building.
I've watch some videos(2 or 4 iirc) in youtube about Palworld, but I still not interested in it. Maybe because i dont really like playing survival game.

But the game looks really fun and interesting, how the multiplayer work? Is it like genshin impact that you need to enter another player world? Or real time like in ark?
    Haven‚Äôt played it yet but I‚Äôve been hearing the survival aspect leaves you wanting to learn and experience the new crafting items as you progress vs sticking with the same crafting items over and over again. I‚Äôve also heard that the survival element becomes less of a center focus so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm interested despite not loving survival games.
        Trust me, I'm HATING survival games (Minecraft, ark and all of them!!!), don't wanted to try palworld, for my brother I'm played it with him ... 9 hours straight without a pause now ...

Early you need to build up some things, eat some Berry's and farm wood or stone but after you settled down an easy base and catched some pals, they do all the work complete alone, we leveld, build and crafted for like 3 hours and after that, we was just exploring for 6 hours straight without any survival aspect (even eating is automatic after you have the item for it).
We already Slain 12 bosses and catched like 80 different pals, it's amazing.

It's more natural and intuitive and easy to understand, I would say the survival part feels like a game feature and not work.
It's bog-standard survival and streamer-bait, but with Pokemon. Recipe for success.
Twitch game of the week + GamePass
    Game pass won't affect steam numbers
Probably the same reason people are throwing down over stanley cups.
its new seasonal game

like among us, only up, lethal company etc
I have the developers other game "craftopia", it's a half baked experience, and now with a new game it's for sure being abandoned. My brother has both and said "palworld is just upgraded craftopia", I won't give money for a dev that just makes a new version of the same game (that's still in early access by the way).
I describe it to my nephew as ‚ÄúAdult Pok√©mon where you fight with the pals‚Äù

I only found out about it yesterday and today I played for 4 hours. 

I enjoy that I get to beat up the pals, use one as a flamethrower and also the one I nicknamed Dragma (Drag Lama due to what look like long boots)
Pok√©mon has burned a lot of fans over the years also survival is popular plus guns and enslaving animals for factory work you get the factorio crowd. Seriously I imagine Pokemon will sue if they could.
People are forgetting two things, but hype and desire getting the best of them. Usually the case. Those two things are:
This dev never finish their game. Their last game craftopia is still in early access after 3 or so years?
Second: people got news that the gamepass and steam version of the game is few patches behind the game now in it's current state, which means players are missing contents.


Wait it out.
Pokemon and survival.. ofc it's popular !
It's pretty good and fun game. Your question is very stupid OP.
it's like ~~Skyrim~~ Pokemon with GUNS
It's the latest fad of the month game.

Nothing else.

Give it a few weeks and watch those numbers sink.
[This](https://youtu.be/eehcRKhjEXE) is quite a relevant reaction to the trailer.
Its fun and refreshing
Pok√©mon is bad and Atlus and Square Enix put no effort marketing SMTV or DQM in the west despite both of them being on the Switch and directly competing with Pok√©mon
I thought it was wild that the same goons who made the trashfire of "craftopia" somehow made the most popular game on steam rn. Im reeling.
    Shows that you should never give up with your goals.
In my opinion, it‚Äôs the first UNIQUE game we have seen in a while. A lot of survival games feel the same, RPGs feel the same, shooters feel the same, etc. This combined 2 genres to create a pretty unique experience that actually works. Just a breath of fresh air for many tbh. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be some game that‚Äôs going to retain such a high player base after years but people are just enjoying it while it‚Äôs new
1.) It‚Äôs fun!
2.) It looks amazing.
3.) The Pals are super cute.
4.) It‚Äôs easy to start and intuitive as you go along.
5.) Even though it‚Äôs easy to start, it‚Äôs still a challenge. Boss fights, dungeons and raids, etc.
6.) The open world feels very much alive and everything feels mysterious and discoverable.
7.) Leveling up brings exciting new tech and recipes.
8.) Its co-op is super smooth and playing with friends is so much fun.
9.) The game is not that expensive. (And there are no micro transactions).
10.) Lots of room for updates being that it‚Äôs early access, and lots of future features that should bolster more fun.¬†


Notes to devs:¬†
I hope they stick with this and fix bugs. Launch.¬†

Sell expansions only. No micro transactions. Keep updating and engaging the player base.¬†
It's a great game and, even at early access day 1, offers more content, fun, and more polish than most triple AAA games released today
Bro it‚Äôs really goofy enough that it‚Äôs fun. Imagine Pok√©mon, but for grown adults
Cause it‚Äôs basically pokemon but for pc and with guns
It's popular because when the first trailer was released it became viral due to the sheer hilarity of the concept. People saw pokemon carrying guns and working in sweatshops and it became a sort of meme. Plus, the trailer came out when Pokemon Legends Arceus was still new and it kinda conflated. Now that the game was released, the fact that it's actually good plus the great marketing, made it a success.

  
I've actually been waiting for the game for years but had my doubts about the game being good because it's made by the same people as Craftopia and Craftopia kinda sucks. But since it's getting such a good reception I'll try it for sure.
Idk, I'm rather playing Pok√©mon on my Switch tbh
It‚Äôs good. That‚Äôs why.
Trailer attracts kids -> they beg parents to buy or buy themselves -> tell their friends -> MASS BUYS -> We are here.
It has been talked about on social media ever since the first trailer. It has had many many articles literally calling it as "pokemon with guns". Now obviously I can't give any reason why It has so much success to already have 1m+ con current players. But I have heard about this game various times over the years.

The pokemon fan base on twitter also pushed this more. So remember the whole JK rowling, Hogwarts legacy thing where people tried to bitch about it online and told people to not buy it and the game got more sales.  
Now pokemon fans are bitching about it on twitter on how they will not support this game and it is basically putting the game on more spotlight.

I eventually even muted the words pokemon, palworld, gamefreak cause of how crazy the pokemon fanbase went over this game. 

The only pokemon games I played are like pokemon fire red or some fan game. I also don't care about ark style survival game. So I am not really bothered much about pokemon or palworld.
Funni geem
Pokemon+pew-pew+survival
    Can you elaborate on the survival aspect? From what I've seen that just means base building
        Survival usually means game aspects like hunger and temperature are something you have to manage while doing other parts of the game but it is often paired with the base building tag as they tend to fit well together with making large bases to automate or at least efficiently manage those survival needs
Hyped kids.
    Or 30y old virgins
        I am neither of those, so why do I enjoy it? The same with a bunch of my friends
Gamers not realizing they're getting tricked into spending money on memes.
    well if they have fun with it, why not
        True. As long as it won't affect other developers. You can play whatever you want, its your money.
            who cares if it does affect other developers, they will start making fun games too?
                No. They will stop actually making clever designs and settle for 5 minute craft videogames and hope it reaches the same level of funny meme. 

Not every genre of videogames can be made with free UE5 assets and AI generating enemies.
                    Developers already do that on their own or are you one of those COD players
                        And how exactly does further enabling to do shitty games help that case?
Why was The Day Before so popular despite being so obviously a scam?

Steam has a HUGE population now. Turns out the majority are gullible idiots. That, plus it's a meme game.

I suspect in a few weeks we'll see the player count plummet significantly as people move on to the next meme-y piece of crap.
    Keep in mind, *everyone* plays games now. Once execs figured out that kids are the ones spending the money they started spending more on marketing and microtransactions that targeted a far younger demographic. 

You see a lot of games now that half is goofy Dreamworks-like aesthetic that‚Äôs cartoony even in games that take themselves seriously.
Fotm early access shite.

For some reason people fall for it over and over and over again
    probably because this one is fun
    No one is forcing you to play early access games, but if you want to hate at least bring genuine criticism
Just did a quick google, and this game looks like ü§°üòÜ
    Congratulations, you haven't played it and have judged it off 10 seconds of pictures
Game is 100% ass.
    Please, elaborate
        On PC it plays like a really cheep console port.  You can't rotate angled wall tiles for roofing, and the interface is complete ass. I made it about an hour before I had better things to do.  Thank goodness I played on Gamepass and didn't pay 40 bucks for it.
            Can't say I've done much with angled walls but I've found the interface simple enough and easy to use even with a lacking tutorial I've been able to figure it all out and I've only played around 10 hours so far with plenty more to explore
Pretty, but boring game.
stupid people+ popular concepts + streamers play it (game is garbage)
    god you must be a miserable person be around with
        Bet he hasn't even played it
        Better to be around smart peole than sick pokemon fans. 

Minority > Majority

You are like mosquitos and ants, you are always together and can just bite and cry.

Are you ashamed being POKEMON fan? You like cute little doggos and dragons in small little cute red ball? Oh, wow <3 Puki moooooooon
            Plenty of people who play this aren't Pok√©mon fans, what are you on?
            Ah..to be 12 again. Fun times. You'll grow up, buddy. It's okay.
    I think your brackets should be (my opinion is garbage)
    Game looks amazing, wtf.
Palworld is proof the Switch could have been the most popular gaming console if Game Freak wasn't so lazy and entitled.  Pokemon games today are fundamentally the same as Pokemon Red / Blue on the Gameboy Pocket.  Zero innovation in all this time.  Small indie teams are more capable of innovating the genre.
I beat up the first human you see in the game and shoved him inside a pokeball. Then an army of overleveled armed assassins went after me because apparently putting humans in pokeballs is illegal or whatever. Fun game
I never ‚Äògot‚Äô the phenomenon of Pok√©mon so I also don‚Äôt get the success of this game. Even the screenshots make me go eek
Never played Ark but love Pok√©mon. Really considering getting this because I want to try an alternate Pok√©mon like game, is it good so far?
I just got my first gun in game. Capping pokemon with a hunting rifle is tooooo fun.
It‚Äôs fun. Pokemon in other ways. My first base is running with the first and weakest pals, providing eggs an way too much wool‚Ä¶

I did not get around much yet but defeated the first raid. Some pathing issues and building roofs is a pita but seeing a Gengar-like Pokemon ahem Pal with a machine gun on the title screen is promising at least.
Nintendo really shouldn't have turned their nose up to computer gaming, that is a huge market they've forfeited.
I'd say it's mostly down to that twitch dude Thor being about it
It's fun. I've never played much survival games so it's new to me, plus the pokemon aspect makes it so fun
It's fun.
Game is fun, I got it on game pass so doesn't cost me anything other than $15 every 3 months. Would I buy the game on steam? Probably not now but I might if they add more stuff to it
Think about it this way.

Take Pokemon. Remove the rules that make the game somewhat ethical (e.g. you don't have to be friends with your Pokemon, Slave Labour is a-ok, and catching literal People is allowed). Now give it aspects from both Ark: Survival Evolved and Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Release the game while the current mainline Pokemon game is absolute trash and buggy as hell. Make the game available on almost every platform, when Pokemon is only on Nintendo systems.

You now have a Viral hit of a game that people have wanted for a very long time. The developer of the game literally took Pokemon and added all the features that everybody has thought about at least once.
Because its fun?
It‚Äôs really fun, it‚Äôs new, there‚Äôs Pok√©mon.
How could we let this happen, Gamers???
I played it on Game Pass. It's pretty fun. It still needs a bit more work but it's surprisingly good.
is a pokemon game but if Game freak actually tried

&#x200B;

still I was never a fan of pokemon, and after seeing the game, is just not for me
Just because you haven't heard about it doesn't mean the rest of us haven't. There was a lot of hype about this game, but due to the day before scam, people were really pessimistic about new indie games. However, once the word spread that it was actually good, fun and affordable, people began to buy it.
Simple answer: It is the Pok√©mon game everyone wants, but the one we know Nintendo will never give.

It's like a combination of Pok√©mon, Ark Survival Evolved with a sprinkle of Rimworld.
A small indie company made a Pok√©mon game with updated models and graphics and unique animations for every single Pok√©mon. Something game freak, another ‚Äúsmall indie company‚Äù has struggled to do.
Trash game imo
Nintendo develops the worst open world Pokemon games and sells millions. It should be understandable that a decent game is so popular
Lets look at this way. Palworld was released in January this year, around the time when there is no news of the next Mainline Pokemon game.

 Couple with the fact that the game is being sold at a dirt cheap price of below US$30 in Early access made it attractive for people to buy the game.
People like get scammed, asset flip, generic UE 5 assets, full of bugs and they stole content from other developers.

Edit. To all fakepokemon dumb players: Thank you for funding scammers and thank you for contributing to the decline of the gaming world
    Proof of the stolen content?
I've seen this multiple times but can't find anything to be honest
        https://imgur.com/a/gFIhOHg

You downvote even proofs now? Holy shish you flat earth bois are insane
            whats wrong with them making similar creatures in their game?
            Nintendog fan boys are here.
[deleted]
    Um you are some kind of ambassador of good taste in games or what?   Just because it doesnt appeal to you means it doesnt makes sense it appeals to alot of other players?

Stop acting like you have moral authority on what should be popular when its clearly subjective.
        [deleted]
            Your problem is you're conflating an aesthetic with quality level. Realism != Good.

The reason this game has the aesthetic it does is because it's inspired by a franchise heavily entwined with anime and made by Japanese devs that are probably fans of anime themselves.

The fact you think that visual style is the biggest indicator of the quality of a game is evidence that, ironically, it's you who is simple minded and easily appeased, having a childish mindset. Shiny thing is not always better (and this game is actually shiny, just in a different font than you deem acceptable, apparently).
This is the roblox generation. They've been playing a horribly ugly game with all kinds of shitty half cooked minigames

Imagine what else they're going to play. And they spend money on this too, its kinda wild
    Eh, I‚Äôd much rather play a genuinely fun game with mid-tier graphics than a beautiful game with mid-tier gameplay. 

So many games these days look amazing, but the controls aren‚Äôt right, they‚Äôre just plain boring, or they‚Äôre bogged down with microtransactions. 

I‚Äôm not defending or praising Palworld btw.
        But roblox is ass on all fronts. That was my point. Also, hey kids, its ok that you played shitty games. Nobody will look down on you for that
            Sadly, AAA games these days are usually creatively stunted and plagued with monetization. Thing is, this is all the younger generations know. 

*Most* of them didn‚Äôt grow up playing Deus Ex, Diablo 1-2, or Half Life 1-2. It‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre missing if you never experienced it. 

The gaming industry is far, FAR more corporate than it was say even 15 years ago. Now more money is spent on marketing than crafting a storyline or making sure the gameplay is fun.
People, especially gamers, are sheep.
One of those unpolished quickly put together games that is lucky enough to go mainstream, i doubt people really enjoy to play it they just do cause its the current trend..
"pokemon with guns and slavery"

So Digimon with slavery
Shame the graphics sucks, looks really bad.
They dumped money into their marketing.
Just another fall guys or whatever the name, few streamers played it and brought players, it will die in a month or so
Man this is the most retarded question I've ever seen here
I'd rather buy any ea game with overwhelming negative reviews and their trash launcher than this palworld shit
    no one asked
        You dumb? OP asked.
            you dumb? He asked for something else
                Fuck off
    I‚Äôve only seen Palworld gameplay so I‚Äôm not in the know, but could you elaborate why?

An EA game with negative reviews is going to be trash. At least Palworld *may* be fun.
    Agree lol
People enjoy AI art apparently
    What exactly are you talking about?
        One of their previous games was based on the concept of AI art. It was a shitty game and mostly negative on Steam.
            actually its mostly positive on steam, do your research first
                I think you should do yours: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154230/AI\_Art\_Impostor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154230/AI_Art_Impostor/?curator_clanid=41648656)

If you read my comment thoroughly you could see I was not talking about Palworld.
                    I thought you are talking about craftopia. Well its good then that palworld has nothing to do with this AI game
Same reason fall guys was popular. It will die in a month dw
Ark clone with pokemon. I mean things like this sells themselves based on aesthetics and ideas. Ark is only popular cause it's the dinosaur game. Stray was popular cause it was the cyberpunk cat game. Palworld is popular cause its the pokemon with guns and slavery game, despite it not really being like pokemon in the slightest. These games don't need to be good to sell, people enjoy them on the concept.
Thug Pok√©mon
Dumb fun
Pok√©mon with guns and you‚Äôre questioning it‚Äôs popularity?
Pokemon minus Nintendo with all policial incorrect possible
Because it's a good game?

 I'm *farrr* more excited about enshrouded which is 3 days away and looks far better than palworld and the same genre.
Its just the newest ‚Äúdude look its just like Pokemon‚Äù game. They pop up every now and then. 

It‚Äôll go the same way it always goes, hyped for a week and then 2 weeks after everybody drops it cuz it doesnt have staying power.
It's also a concept that appeals to a ton of demographics. My entire group of friends are playing, and we mostly aren't Pokemon players. Also, many of our partners are playing as well, despite them not being heavy gamers. It's a perfect storm type of game, scratching many itches.
    ARK players, too. I have fond memories of that game, but it‚Äôs so janky and such a pain in so many ways. Palwork takes out a lot of the friction from Ark (like long taming times and limited abilities to automate dinosaurs working).¬†
        I‚Äôm a current ark player and the amount of ex tribe mates that are begging me to come play is ridiculous
            lmao same. this game in my opinion has a chance to be almost as big or bigger than ark
                It already dwarfs Ark like the sun dwarfs the Earth
        And Palworld is only a fraction of the GBs Ark takes.
            I was wondering about that. Why does Ark take so much disk space, makes no sense
                Just terrible optimization
                Lots of it is the maps, you can reduce the space by only installing some of them.  The game has like 10 different world maps that are pretty detailed and a lot of extra data tied to them plus unique textures.
            69 likes
        All of that is completely customizable in Ark. How could you not be aware of that?
    This is true. My wife is not a gamer, but she played for 15 hours straight yesterday.
    It has co-op?
        yes, up to 32 players
            I would say there is co-op up to 4 people and then there are servers with 32 players. I have not tried pal world solo with friends but I'm playing on a dedicated server with friends
    It's like a Among us/Fall guys/ Lethal company kinda game, There is one of those every year lmao
        except those games never even came close to Dota 2, dota 2s all time peak is 1,295,114 and Palworlds is 1,291,967. Palworld only came out 3 days ago and I hadn't ever heard of it before yesterday, How tf is all this possible? especially since when looking at gameplay and trailers it doesn't look like anything special, on top of that is $40???  its literally the most-played paid game of all time how does this make sense.

edit: the above number is the peak player count on steam alone
            And it launched on game pass, and those numbers don‚Äôt even include game pass, that‚Äôs the really insane detail that no one is mentioning.
            Damn I knew it was a big deal but not THAT big of a deal, this is insane lmao

can anyone who has played it let us know if the game is actually good? XD
            PUBG hit 3mil+ when it was paid back in 2018, so idk about that?
                Damn, I forgot abt that i thought it was always free for some reason, no one seems to be mentioning it. Ive seen game news sites say Palworld's the most played paid game of all time,

  Regardless tho 2nd place is still insane. Pubg was literally impossible to miss back then, same with games like among us i mean literally every single creator I watched was playing these games, but I haven't seen almost anyone posting vids about Palword even now a couple of days after ea release. I just don't get how the game's so dang popular
            >and I hadn't ever heard of it before yesterday, How tf is this all possible?

You just dont spend any time on Twitter, Twitch or Youtube.  Period.  That wasnt really that difficult to deduce.  If you're not on the internet, you're not going to hear about things.  Pretty simple concept I would say.
    What's your age range? Cus I look at the videos for this game and it looks like a game made for teens tbqh. But I guess you late 20 early 30 peeps were into Pokemon too.
i hate pokemon and i love palworld, its more like Ark than Pokemon imo
    100% Agreed people comparing it to Pokemon is basically a buzz word now.
        It's far more like ark in gameplay than Pokemon, but ANY creature collection game gets compared to Pokemon.
            [deleted]
                Palworld is not in an active lawsuit with Nintendo.
                    My bad, Nintendo is in the process of finalizing their lawsuit because palworld is in clear copyright violation ü§¶ use commonsense
                        What exactly are they in violation of? I highly doubt Palworld would've even hit market if they had grounds for litigation given it was anmounced im 2021. The person who was selling mods using their IP already got a cease and desist.

Also copyright infringement isn't a common sense thing. Or maybe it is to you. Are you a patent lawyer?  

Even if they did sue it doesn't mean they would win either. The proof would have to be incontrovertible and I've yet to see anything unless you know something nobody else does.
                            Not to mention the headlines for palworld is "Pok√©mon with guns", like hello??? Doesn't take a rocket scientist ü§¶
                                Those are journalists who write those headlines not the developers...
                                Absolutely nowhere on the game does it say that, dude you ate so full of shit. Every sentence you have made on this post is pure lies. Just because you read some person on the internet saying it's pokemon with guns doesn't mean it's official palworld news. You are either 12 or just an idiot
                            [Forbes ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/01/24/the-pokemon-company-announces-it-will-investigate-palworld-ip-and-assets/)

[bbc](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-68092330)

[Marketing-Interactive](https://www.marketing-interactive.com/pokemon-copyright-investigation-palworld)

[CharlieIntel](https://www.charlieintel.com/pokemon/the-pokemon-company-confirm-theyre-investigating-palworld-copyright-allegations-299891/)

‚ÄúWe have not granted any permission for the use of Pok√©mon intellectual property or assets in that game,‚Äù the company said in a statement.

‚ÄúWe intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pok√©mon,‚Äù it added.


Do I need to say more?
                                You clearly aren't reading any of the links you posted lmao. These are all quotes from the above articles. 

"The Pok√©mon Company also said that the investigations are in response to having received many inquiries regarding an unnamed game by another company released in January"

"While it is significant that The Pok√©mon Company issued a statement about this situation, the way it reads does not really imply anything much would probably happen here. Nintendo has says they haven‚Äôt licensed any IP or assets to Palworld which I mean, of course they didn‚Äôt."

"As for IP, clearly no actual terms or exact characters from Pok√©mon are being used. Nintendo immediately got a Pok√©mon reskin mod for Palworld taken down when it went live, and I cannot see them having much of a case comparing two electric mice and proving that the concept infringes on Pikachu. You can‚Äôt copyright the concept of an electric mouse."

"Palworld was also in development for many years before this so this is not exactly news to The Pok√©mon Company and Nintendo that this game and its Pok√©mon-adjacent monsters exist. This reads like a statement that they should probably say something given how big this game has gotten, though I would be amazed if this ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù turned up anything that could cause real harm to Palworld, which at the time of this writing, has just passed eight million copies sold in six days."
                            It's just commonsense buddy, a game that has nothing to do with Nintendo comes out with a game that has "Pok√©mon" that are basically ripping off Pok√©mon; sorry you can't piece that together?
                                I only responded to you because you said they were in the middle of an active lawsuit which is verifiably untrue. Idk why youre being a dick about it. 

"Basically" doesn't sound iron clad to me personally. If it was so open and shut then sales would likely *already* be blocked and it would be incredibly easy to point out where exactly the infringement is. Palworld isn't the first game to use the catching monsters concept and Pok√©mon wasn't the first. Do you have actual examples? Have you played the game? 

The person who did side by sides on blender of 3D models that went viral already recanted their statements and admitted to exaggerating the similarities. 

Could Nintendo sue? Sure. Anyone can sue anyone for anything. Do they have grounds? It doesn't seem like it, but I suppose we will see. I just highly doubt Nintendo would've let Palworld sell 6 million copies if it's as cut and dry as you are implying.
                No its not you just completely made that shit up.
        That's because most people are like OP, they only know it from a few images.
Yeah we are, the game basically makes itself and GF/Nintendo can't/won't make it. They could just make the anime a playable game that runs at a stable 30 FPS and most people would probably be happy
    Hopefully this will show them that the fans will clamor for something more than the old formula and Game Freak will maybe change things up.
        I mean they did something good with Arceus so if they could expand on that by about ten fold then we could have a really decent game.
            Arceus is like the beta test to what Palworld is.
                Arceus is like bedof and palworld is like arceus
        Oh they know, but since the stuff they keep pushing out sells just fine, they don't care
            It‚Äôs crazy that capitalism or whatever you want to call it, evolved Pokemon to this point. The amount of money they are missing out on by taking risks making good products over safe bets‚Ä¶.who knows
                Pokemon Violet in all it's shoddy, bland glory sold 23.2 MILLION copies. Nintendo isn't missing out on anything.
        Pokemon fans have been hoping that for years upon years now. Everytime a new monster collecting game gets popular, nothing changes.
            Because the games sell. The adults who‚Äôve been playing for years can‚Äôt let go, and parents buy for their kids. The simple nature of story is friendly for young children dipping into JRPGS, while online battling tends more to the long time players, or even shiny hunting. People complain about the system, but remember. The franchise that was only supposed to be one game, is still marking millions of sales. SwSh and SV despite being ‚Äúhated‚Äù are second and third respectively in sales behind the original games.
        they're an Japanese company, like hell they'll change.
    they "can't/won't" make it because it was never the purpose of pokemon.  


Pokemon always been a children game. An entry milestone in video game. Your first mythic triple A game.   


It was not ment to be 20 years story arc with each extension answering the previous to accompany a loser from 7yo to the tomb.  


Pokemon fandom are just degenerates and people asking for mature pokemon games are just failures. You guys can't even comprehend these simple things and are simping on a zero effort game ripping off everything from UI to DA and mechanics.   


You are just pathetic manchild, lol, grow up mother fucker.
This. Minus the guns and stuff, this is the Pok√©mon game I‚Äôve been waiting for since the jump to 3d. I played so much today my eyes hurt.
"Pokemon fans are starved for a decent game" is me and is very accurate. I've been playing pokemon since the gba era and I am disappointed with scarlet violet lol. Hoping they make another Legends Arceus soon. But for now, I'm really enjoying palworld
Plus it was being talked about a lot before release, OP may have missed it but it surely wasn't for lack of publicity
    I also missed it and I am always looking for new exciting games literally everywhere, i don't understand how it's so popular, I had never even heard of it before yesterday
>Pokemon fans are starved for a decent game 

Try saying this r\\pokemon. Bruh those children cant take it and will ban you or delete the post.
I've never played Pok√©mon but I'm thoroughly addicted to Palworld! I skimmed by it in Game Pass for weeks before finally giving it a shot and so glad I did. I haven't been so involved and fascinated by a game since picking up Destiny for the first time when it was in alpha testing.

I do wish they would get the maps built out though. I have 2 dead bodies I'd like to go pick up under the floor in the top right side of the map.
This. Pokemon fans have wanted an open world game like this for decades. Ark gave the blueprint. Sprinkle in some Zelda and you've got a great game.

There's so much potential to take this game even further tbh. If Nintendo had done it this could have been the Ocarina of Time of Pokemon games.
I don't get it, I haven't played Scarlet and Violet yet, but the most recent pokemon games have been incredible. and are still have an easy alignment with the rest of the franchise, although this palworld game seems fun.
Most pokemon fans are not starved for a decent game lmao. Performance issues aside scarlet and violent was amazing for hardcore fans
Likely this is scratching an itch that people have wanted Pokemon to scratch for a long time
    Drop the survival aspect and I'd been more interested tbh.

The itch I have is a more grown up jrpg version, arceus was in the right direction
        You can drop most of the survival aspects in settings.
            Survival only plays a role early. Once you have your first berry farm you have infinite food. Maybe in the future they change stuff because right now that's all you need. You don't even need water.

What is nice though is that your Pokemon get sick and you have to craft medicine. Or catch a new one too replace the slave hahaha
                Strict up survival is pretty tame that is true, however it comes with many gameplay aspects that are generally used in survival games like based building, lots of farming etc. The core Gameplay-loop is more like a survival than a Pokemon game.
            I‚Äôm having a lot more fun since doing this. Can‚Äôt be bothered with survival games where you‚Äôre constantly battling hot/cold and hunger.
                The problem for me is they always make the hunger deplete way too fast. Same with thirst if implemented. I know you can change it in settings but my first playthrough has been just normal to get the hang of things.

Catching pals is pretty damn easy. Caught lvl 15 dinos and a lvl 15 deer at lvl 7. Also caught a lvl 11 giant bird. All at lvl 7. 

The punk looking Dino kid is a pretty good companion for catching other pals. 

It would be really cool to be able to have all 5 pals out following you.
            Is it still fun as a single player game?
                I've only played alone so far and I'm having fun. hoping my friends decide to get it at some point to try co-op
                Haven't touched multiplayer yet and probably never will except for when my wife finally has time and the mental energy to play but solo has been an absolute blast.
                I hear one of the main reasons single player works so well with this game is thanks to the pals, since you will neither feel alone nor will have to do all the work of resource gathering by yourself since you have, well, you know, your pals.
                It‚Äôs server to server, so solo is for your intense grind and base building and then multiplayer is just to chill on
                    No?

You just have 1 friend host an open server so you and your friends can drop in and out at any time 24/7.

 That's where the real fun of these games lie.
            Explain

No way I got down voted because I wanted to know something lol
                when you first start you make a decision on "world settings" before you actually start playing. here you can choose preset casual-hard or custom. you can have multiple worlds saved with unique settings. you can customize all settings in each preset as well. the settings you can change are on a sliding scale and go from 0/0.1/0.5 to 3/5/10/5000 depending on the setting.

                Money can be *exchanged* for goods and services!
                    God damn it you beat me too it.
                You can adjust difficulty and the various difficulty gives or takes away things that add to the game. Or you can set a custom difficulty like enemy HP or ATK exp and things of that nature. I can‚Äôt remember the full list of settings but you can change it to how you want to play.
        The game is extremely customizable. You can tune almost every setting to the point you can drastically limit survival elements to be trivial.
        Try it, it's everything people wanted arceus to be. Survival is there but after the beginning it takes less relevance.
            Yeah it honestly isnt really survival. You kill one pal every now and again if you're hungry, normal difficulty hunger drain is basically negligible
                You don't even need to kill Pals for food once you get the Pal that produces berries for you. In our private server, between the 5 of us, we all have at least 100 cooked berries on each of us and at least 150 in our food basket and another 200+ in the fridge
                an hour in you get a feed bag also that auto fees.
                You realize you can have chickens hatch eggs for you right?
            I did on gamepass, I found the tutorial borderline useless as it didn't explain how to do things just what to do. Even eating food took pressing every button trying to figure out which worked. Everything felt and looked unfinished. Hearing the survival aspect drops off it nice to hear tho

Maybe in a few patches, but I'm aware the gamepass version is wya before the steam. Version
                The game has a section in the options called survival guide. It explains most of the things.
                To each their own, but I‚Äôm genuinely sick of long winded tutorials that I‚Äôm forced to complete. This game has a short quick one that in theory you don‚Äôt even have to do. I rate that highly. Let me work stuff out for myself, sick of being told how to do absolutely EVRRYTHING in every game I play. Let me learn it myself if I want to. (I understand some want full tutorials, but more games need to make it optional)
        Digimon Cyber Sleuth is what you‚Äôre looking for.
            Such a great game. Was not expecting how dark some of the cases got.

Edit: Think I still need to actually beat it and start the 2nd game.
                I was not expecting Hacker's Memory to be as good as it was, but it's a really interesting story and it's fun how it intersects with the main story of Cybersleuth.
            This is something that has interested me, need to check how it runs on deck
        The settings basically allow you to remove the survival aspect
        I just change the world settings to not deal with the survival aspects since I also hate survival games. 

Honestly this game would be so much better if it didn't lean so far into the survival part.
            >Honestly this game would be so much better if it didn't mean so far into the survival part.

After a few hours, your Pals start automating everything for you. All we do now is explore, do dungeons, capture more Pals, and fight bosses
                How do I get them to stop ADD'ing out? They do a 1/10th of a task and then go do something else
                    lift them and throw them at the task you want them to do, you can see the task assigning to them when you hold the throw button
                    I've found that you need to get the Pals that can *only* do one or two things. If they can do everything, they'll try to do everything. Also, if you pick them up and throw them onto a task, it will assign them to it
                    Make sure to have clear pathways between tasks, chests and other spots they go to. There are very annoying hitboxes on few stuff you build that will block pathing and fuck with AI, also they care a lot about the way stuff is facing so don't build stations facing wall on 4th floor. 

On my 2nd playthrough(wanted to restart to try stuff out) I went straight away to big flat zone and built a lot of wooden floor before even placing my tablet.
        I wonder if the survival stuff can be modded out or turned off in the menus. I avoid survival crafting bs like it's a disease. But I love the idea of open world exploration with Pok√©mon like companion and guns... although I don't really want to shoot them.
            Killing Pals is the best part! Or putting them to work on your compound. 

You can host a server and change the hunger options and edit the game rules.
        This was me, downloaded and jumped in, within 15 minutes I got over-encumbered and thought, nah, I ain't doing this again.  I loved the idea of Pokemon with guns.  Can't be bothered with another survival game where you have to play for hours before you can do fun stuff
    Yeah ive wanted slavery for so long in pokemon of course.
        That's always been there? You catch a wild animal and force it to fight for you until it passes out from pain. How's that any different here?
            In Pokemon it was presented more as a "partnership" after the initial taming; in Palworld there is no ambiguity.
                Partnership... Except for the hundreds of Pokemon you have sitting in stasis. 

Gotta catch em all, to sit in a void for all eternity? 

Dark as fuck.
                Except for those two games that basically called it slavery...
                It's not slavery because they like it  
They smile therefore it's not Stockholm syndrome

Pok√©mon games are weird man  
Even if they try to make it ambiguous and friendly, the whole concept has always been weird when you look at it 

Oh well, I'm having fun with palworld now
        Pok√©mon MASTER
Are you saying that Pokemon is not slavery in itself?
    funny because this was the theme of Pokemon Black and white. Goated games imo and easily the peak of pokemon.
        People say that but they kinda immediately throw out that theme and it turns out the whole "free Pok√©mon" movement was just a conspiracy set up by the team rocket of that game and Pok√©mon actually like being subjugated or something.
    less so but it kinda is. pokemon is more like taming but yeah you could say it is also slavery as some are smarter.
    Yeah I don't get all this slavery nonsense in palworld. Was funny the first couple of times I heard it and now it's just annoying. I can't see how I'm treated any different to these pals by my government and Apparently I'm far from a slave
        wait until all of your pals have developed eating disorders and refuse to work, so you ceremoniously butcher one of them to send a message to the others
            If by ceremonically you mean merging all the shit pals into one pal, and then butchering that pal in front of them while they're eating breakfast
            Isn't that what employers basically do when staff are under performing in the real world? Threaten them with the sack which leads to no money which leads to starvation?
        People ruin their underwear over GTA6 but apparently this game has slavery in it even though all my guys got endless food and a jacuzzi to chill in
        I mean, you can literally capture humans and sell them so...

Edit: idk who down voted me, but I'm dead serious. Any NPC in game minus the tower bosses are capturable
            Well. Technically they are not humans and they are not on planet earth, it's just fantasy. they are just pixels and you can do this sort of stuff in loads of games. It isn't like the game forces you to do that you do it you are making them slaves out of your own will. Much worse goes on in games like rust and ark.¬†
                I don't recall anyone saying you're forced to capture the NPCs? Just that you can, and given that they are shaped like a human, act like a human, and speak like a human, its relatively easy to compare it to slavery as a joke. Especially since the humans sell so damn well üòÇ 500 or so gold per. 

But really, you're taking a joke about the games mechanics a little personally. If you don't wanna capture the syndicate dudes and just wanna kill them, go for it. Play how you want to
        Bro, you are approaching the point. You are a wage slave. Read Anarchist literature and watch Zeitgeist Addendum & Zeitgeist Moving Forward. Trust me.
A game can be literally perfect and still fail because of marketing. My question is HOW did Palworld just overtake CS2? I've never heard of this game, the OP never heard of this game, and other people in this thread never heard of it.

If this is legit, then they are a GENIUS level marketologist bigger than even PlayerUnknown. Where did these people come from if there was no real advertising or a campaign?
    I mean that's like asking how Lethal Company got popular when it was a single person project and got into steam's top 10 by concurrent players. Some games just get lucky and spread from person to person & get picked up by youtubers/tik-tok.

Success is 50% luck and 50% effort.
        I'd say more than 50% luck these days, especially when you're a solo dev with no spare money for advertising. Posts on reddit might get a few players but likely not enough to boost you into visibility, and twitter no chance unless you already had a following, which is unlikely for most people.
            You think getting one of the highest played games is luck? I dunno man. I would say the game needs to be pretty damn good.
                No, I think regardless of effort if you're unlucky your game will go nowhere. You can have the greatest idea and solid execution, and it doesn't matter if nobody finds your game.  

The lethal companies of game releases are one in tens of thousands, if not more.
                    Maybe. Do you have any examples of really solid games that never got any traction?
                        Off the top of my head, no. That said, once the next steam next fest rolls around you could look at the steamdb charts for the majority of games that get featured there and you'll find that they either gained only a small temporary influx in sales, or none at all. That isn't to say that every game there is a gem to everyone because that's too subjective, but that many games that could be gems just never get the opportunity/exposure to get to that point.  

So yeah, I'm not saying these people put in no effort and don't deserve their game taking off, just that effort is not a guarantee and without the resources to make large advertising pushes (and even then) there is a significant chance that the game flies completely under the radar.
                            So you have a theory, but no evidence.

I don't completely disagree with you though. I do think some luck is involved as well, but imo the luck really comes down to finding a formula with broad appeal. There probably are solid games with low sales, but they probably don't have broad appeal.

In general though, I think that to even have a chance at being a highly played game, it's gotta be a damn good game.
                                Steps To Getting Downvoted On Reddit

1. Locate a comment that is one (or more) of the following: an overgeneralization, an opinion presented as fact, or an unsupported conclusion

2. Request *any* form of evidence: data, examples, screenshots, tweets, literally anything

3. Once it is clear that no evidence can/will be provided, note that there does not seem to be evidence to support the initial claim.

4. lmaoooo get fucked asshole LOL substantiated claims are BORING and for fuckin' NERDS get out of here with your reasonable discourse

5. DAE feel like 2+2 actually = 5???
                        I can give you 3 - which of course are my subjective opinions (otherwise the games would be popular obviously lol)

Shadowrun (2007) Xbox/PC - one of the very first cross-platform FPS games, has a 'buy system' similar to CS:GO, and abilities like that of Overwatch or Valorant (teleport dash through wall/floor, place a tree of healing) 

\[personally, teleporting through walls in an FPS game in 2007 was so cool and revolutionary to me\]

- maybe it was just too ahead of its time, but apparently I just read that the servers are still live and running

Battleborn (2016) PS/Xbox/PC - I believe this to be the best example in terms of luck. They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms. It was a 5v5 team based game sort of like LoL in the sense of PvPvE where you can capture points to get AI to fight alongside you (I think that's how LoL works, at least) - but it was First Person, and the first time anything like this released on console.

- unfortunately for them, they released their game within 21 days of one of the most popular games of all time, Overwatch, so lots of direct comparisons were made between the 2 FPS games.. and only one survived in the end

Blazing Sails (2021) \[2023 official release\] PC - you show this game to a Sea of Thieves diehard and after 4 seconds they will call it a knockoff and dismiss it, which is what happened at the game's launch. I played SoT only a couple times, and while I admired the graphics and mechanics - I quickly lost interest after discovering that majority of the gameplay is PvE oriented, extremely repetitive, and lacks hardly any variables in the game (only 3 different guns, 1 melee weapon... this still stands true 6 years later)

(I am biased, I am not going to try to pretend otherwise lol) 

- this is why I was excited to come across Blazing Sails.. it is everything I wish SoT was. It removes the PvE aspect out of the game, leaving only fast paced PvP left. And most notably, the game is objectively 100x better in the area that has been SoT's #1 most well known issue for 6 years running now: Hit Registration. The game also launched with I believe around 12+ weapons, so it already had more depth in terms of variables (currently 21+ weapons) 

The hit reg in this game is one of the best I've seen in a game, which surprised me for an indie cartoon pirate game. I used to be active in the game's discord when it first came out and told the devs how good the hit reg was, especially in comparison to SoT.. and that it should be one of the main selling points

I believe it to be a combination of bad luck in terms of not gaining any traction, not having any big streamers play, as well possibly bad marketing in distinguishing themselves from SoT from the start. It is one of the few games I've seen on Steam that has a 90% rating, and nearly every negative review is about there being a lack of players, not the actual game itself.

Blazing Sails just released their official trailer a couple months ago, and the last line of it is "...so feast your eyes on an Indie game, so eye-watering, you'll mistake the work of one family of 4 in Belgium, for that of hundreds in a multi-national, AAA studio - then gasp in utter disbelief at which one actually delivers accurate hit reg"
                            > They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms.

Just wanted to say you reminded me of Monday Night Combat. A TPS-MOBA. I freaking loved that game!
                                dude.. what!?- how have I never seen that game?

I just watched some videos, and that looks way ahead of its time.. idk how I haven't seen that before :o
                            Yeah, there's definitely games that are overhyped and there's definitely games that are underhyped, and luck definitely IS a part of it...

The problem is that the entire conversation is sort of hamstrung by the fact that "Luck" is such a nebulous concept. Like, we all more or less know what we mean by "luck", except there's a lot of real-world complexity that the word "luck" hand-waves away--albeit unintentionally.

To use a recent example, is it luck that Lies of P was such an unexpected smash hit yet Lords of the Fallen had an ambivalent, mostly lukewarm reception? 

Sort of? But what do i/we mean by "luck" in this instance, right? We're not just saying "oh yeah, it's a total dice roll"... Realistically, the "luck" came from the fact that Lies of P was a unique blend of ideas (Fairy Tale x Souls), part of it came from the fact that it was--in many people's estimation--the first game to go toe-to-toe with FromSoft's combat design. 

And so there's a luck factor to that: Because Lies of P came out a couple weeks prior to LotF, people perhaps evaluated LotF more critically than they would have if Lies of P hadn't come out at all. 

But IS that luck? Hard to say, because there were a million-billion decisions made along the way that led to the outcome that we now might refer to as "lucky" or "unlucky"

Idk, not really agreeing or disagreeing, just find it an interesting topic.
                    The mentality that everything comes down to luck is cope. Success is earned.
    For me a trailer popped up on YouTube like 2 years ago and I've had it wishlisted ever since. Sometimes a concept and timing is all you need for word of mouth to take over.
    So, I came across this game about 4 years ago. I can't even remember how ( maybe YouTube), but I had no idea if it was ever going to come to light. Over the past few years, I have seen 2 trailers. I just happened to hop on Steam yesterday, and it dropped in early access. I dropped what I was doing because I got so excited.
    It got shown years ago and I think almost everyone forgot.
    Its just leeching of a big franchise, in a hopefully good way. Not that surprising really. the idea is good enough that itll just get traction if you show it to big people. 

Pokemons simply appeal to quite a few people because of how cute they look, the gameplay has also a variety that will appeal to a broad set of people.
        No, I get it. Im just surprised that the game is THIS popular while a small proportion of reddit users know what it is. Also, it's paid so that drastically increases the entry floor, unlike dota 2, and CS2 which used to dominate the chart until this game came out
            Im guessing streamers because this game seems to be the perfect type of game to stream. its cute and has a lot to play around with.
            I've seen three posts about it in the last 24 hours. There's your marketing. Wouldn't be surprised if some percentage of these posts are from the marketing team themselves.
    I have had pal world wishlisted for years and have followed it closely. Speak for your self....
    I'd assume it got quite a bit of exposure from being Day 1 on GamePass. I saw the trailer from Xbox account marketing this game.
    They aren't marketing genious. Video game industry is dead. It is how braindead consumers buy games nowaday. And streamers.   


Most popular games are just empty shells made to milk money from dumbfucks. It's just one of these honkai, genshin, now you have palwords.   


Welcome to modern day, when only video game with 0 interest made with 0 effort. Wich wouldn't have event touch internet culture back in early 2000 now is worldwid success.   


People are zombies who really really like to eat hot turds. Do not respect people, they do not deserv it.
Slavery???? Maybe I will give it a try.....
The confederate dream.
So like America right?
    Lol slavery existed in all areas at certain points in time
        Still exists in Africa today
    Yeah, the Philippines too bud
    We can see why it appeals to people eh?
    I guess you skipped History class (unless your country's schools don't offer history classes, if so, my condolences).
Ah, so modded RimWorld but it's 3D?
    No
That's so cool it's on my wishlist.
You. Can. Catch. People. Make. Them. Work. Or. Sell. Them. On. The. Black. Market.
Pokemon is already slavery
    Yes but more. Factory sweatshops and you can eat them.
        Also you can capture actual people in palworld
            what? lol

players or NPCs?
                NPCs. There's no pvp
                    what do NPCs do? are there fixed settlements or are they just other survivors or how does that work?  I find the steam page description rather lacking
                        You can make them a camp slave or make them fight for you like a Pok√©mon. Or you can sell them for a good price to the black market trader.
        lol what?
            Yes that‚Äôs right
    DAE
Wait, isn't the slavery part already included with Pok√©mon?
[deleted]
    what would you call it? You can literally have monsters, that you capture with balls, which you can put in your pocket (pocket monsters so to speak, aka pokemons), fight for you, while using guns yourself.
    Lol dude is getting mad at people innocently describing a game
https://store.steampowered.com/app/2348100/YEAH_YOU_WANT_THOSE_GAMES_RIGHT_SO_HERE_YOU_GO_NOW_LETS_SEE_YOU_CLEAR_THEM/
    Buying it as a joke. That's some good stuff
        I'll probably play it.  But I definitely bought it because they went out of their way to make it happen, so I feel like they should reap the rewards.
        It's no joke though, it's actually pretty decent. I mostly enjoy the potion mixing game.
    haha my wif bought this one, its awesome! I reaaallly wanted to play those games, but i'd never ever download those pieces of junk on my phone.
        >but i'd never ever download those pieces of junk on my phone.

Then maybe you miss the joke, which is that the game never actually is the one in the ad.  So you download something totally different that isn't what you wanted to play.  This steam game is actually all the games in the ads that are fake games to get you to download.
    I need to get that one day lol
    I own this and it's great. Wish they'd add a bit more and tweak some of the controls. Otherwise I love it.
    Saving this one lmao
in a good way or bad?
    From what I've heard from a friend who plays the game, good. It apparently is basically Ark with Pokemon.
        It gives me cube world vibes which i deeply miss.. it looks adorable
            When my penguins haul my wood around they balance it on their head and just kind of bounce around my camp with it. It's adorable and my wife and I are having a blast
            It is adorable. You can actually interact with your Pals and their reactions are so damn cute! It makes you feel even worse for making them work in the quarries or slaughtering the rest of their species :c
    Really good! I fucking hate survival games. I started Friday and have played 15 hours on a work weekend. The slavery aspect takes away so much of the busy work with survival games. You need ore? Send that MFing seal to the mine it's great
    It's brilliant.i bought it thinking I'll try it out and refund before two hours. I played it for 6 hours straight and I've never done that with a game before. Time just melts away. And it's cute.
    I easily got 30 bucks worth of fun the first night I played it, and I haven't even joined my friends server yet.
    In a good way. Progression is honestly fun and exploration is cool
The thing is, Pok√©mon games keep selling like they're the best thing ever made. So it's definitely not gonna change anytime soon.
    while being the most average thing ever made
        Even average games run above 20 FPS and don't rip out features with each iteration.
            Yeah same deal with the FiFAs and CODs, can just push out any garbage when you have a mindless horde buying everything¬†
                Because despite what a lot of people might want to believe, 80% of the Pokemon playerbase are under the age of 14 and have barely any reference to how good the game should be, let alone whether the game is actually any good or not.

When you're a kid any game can be good...
                    Not true, the younger generation is almost, if not more, obsessed with retro games now than ever before with help from youtube. It's one of the reasons the old pokemon games won't drop in value, despite having a bazillion copies each, because the newer generations want to re buy gameboys/ds and play those games they missed out on that us adults keep saying were the best.

And God forbid Nintendo re releases them on Switch and make themselves an insurmountable fortune with the profits they'd make.
            [deleted]
                Yep, I didn't even buy S/V because it's just such unexcusable dogshit. They then admitted it, after the outrage, and instead of fixing the game, released dlc....bruh. They have zero reason to make the game better so I'll just be sad and not buy their games anymore. I know it doesn't make a difference but there are SO many games that come out that are more worth my time and money
                    [deleted]
                        When the spin offs on gamecube have better animations and frame rate then games on the switch, you'd think they'd actually start caring about the quality control. 

It's just such a sad fall from grace seeing every game get worse and worse. Hopefully Nintendo starts spreading the license around more. Until then I'll keep enjoying actual good games like bg3 lol
            I almost think they made exp share mandatory out of spite.¬†
        Average is a huge compliment to those games
    Which is so sad. I quit playing after Sun and Moon because quality consistently went down starting with X and Y. I‚Äôve owned every gen since gen 2 and was hoping I‚Äôd one day gift every pokemon I owned to any kids I had.
    They have two options:


Spend $80m and sell 20 million copies at $40 each


Put in extra effort, spend $200m and sell 20 million copies at $40 each
        As someone who work in IT. It is hillarious to witness people asking nintendo to make effort. When they created the franchise. The franchise never was to be a story arc extension from extension. It's more like an entry rpg for children and every iteration is addressed to new children, no to 50 yo manchild who played them all.  
You can't even have a grasp on the very existence of the ip but anyway...  


So these Nintendo evil guys are the one puting 0 effort in their game. But on the other hand. Palworld, ripping everything from mechanics, to UI to artistic direction are the one putting in the effort. I guess the climax of these effort were made when they were feeding the pokemon games to their IA.   


Fucking tool. And I'm not a pokemon fan. Fuck pokemon, you're supposed to play one of their game and that's it. Fuck "gamers". Fuck "video game" industry. And all of you enjoying palworlds should commit suicide. You are enjoying the worst turd ever created since NFT games.
            Buying two copies of Palworlds now due to this post. Thanks for the suggestion.
It'll set a fire under them.

For their lawyers.

I'm sure Game Freak is going to try and pull something out of their ass, about the game infringing on their IP or something. It'll be unlikely to go anywhere, but like you said this probably won't cause much change with GF for now. Especially since I doubt if, assuming the game's full release does really well, Nintendo would still let it get ported to whatever system they have at the time.
    They're not going to sue them since they're not directly ripping the assets off. Yes a good chunk of the pals look a lot like existing pokemon designs but that's not enough of a sway in the Japanese court. If you think Nintendo/TPCi will sue all creature collecting games that gets slightly popular then we would have long heard that they have long sued the likes of Digimon, Yokai Watch, Temtem, Nexomon, Neopets, etc. 

Only those romhacks like Pokemon Uranium gets the letter from the lawyers since those are directly using Nintendo / TPCi assets as it features actual Pokemon IP at the game.
        Plus you can capture humans in Palworld. Can‚Äôt do that in Pok√©mon
    I doubt it... creature collecting games are a genre on Steam now. 

Are consumers likely to get confused when purchasing Palworld? It's a survival game with guns. Some of the monsters are similar but are they going to argue in court that a leaf monkey was a rip off of a fire monkey in a different game? Idk.. just doesn't seem like it would hold up in court.

Most game devs have lawyers that they consult on this type of thing so I think it's fine. Temtem is more like Pokemon than Palworld.
I don't know if the reason is because of the quality of their current games. I think the main issue is that you can't play a pok√©mon game unless you have a Nintendo switch, or any Nintendo console. The success of Palworld could be all of those gamers who do not have access to buy a Pokemon game.
    Accessibility is not the issue, this much is clear. The real issue is gamefreak and their mismanagement of the game. 

Not enough devs, not enough time, not enough budget. BoTW/ToTK/MPRemake/MarioOddysey are all good games with good graphics that sold well and run perfectly fine most of the time.

Pokemon has is the one major franchise partly owned by Nintendo to not run well and not even because of the graphics. Not to mention its outsold palworld multiple times I've despite being on switch alone.

BDP sold 15m~ copies. Palworld has around 3m~ from what im seeing, this ofcourse is likely to increase within the coming months. Within 6 months is probably the best time to compare these numbers since that's what the source for bdsp said it took to reach 15m.

This still makes it very clear, it being a console exclusive isn't the issue.
        Gamefreak really struggled with the transition to 3D and to the Switch. Their other Switch games (unrelated to Pokemon) also run poorly in many cases. Somewhere there‚Äôs an alternate universe where they stuck with high-quality 2D (like Octopath), but that still doesn‚Äôt address the other game design issues.

I do think some of SV‚Äôs sales were boosted by the SwSh DLC and Arceus. Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra both brought in interesting features that fans enjoyed and it seemed like they were listening to players. Arceus was also an interesting refresh of the formula (didn‚Äôt land for everyone, but it was something that added a lot of neat features like catching pokemon outside of combat).¬†

So I certainly expected that SV would continue that trend. Sadly, it did not, especially since some of the concepts were a good idea just very flawed in execution.
            Yeah, I kinda wish they returned to 2D in a similar vein to octopath, but that's never gonna happen at this rate.

Although I do think we still have a chance to see another Legends game which I want to see.
                Legends Arceus was the only game that actually justified the jump to 3D instead of being 3D just because. 

Arceus was revolutionary for a Pokemon game, but compared to the jumps other franchises have made, it's rather tame and half baked.
        To back up your point, you could also use Scarlet/Violet as a comparison, which came out more recently. It has sold over 23m copies and was Nintendo's biggest launch ever (10m sales in 3 days).
        Fair point and good resourceful info. Thank you for your reply.
Crazy, as much as I'm into video games, this is the first time I've heard of it.¬†
    I remember seeing alpha gameplay on Twitter like a millennia ago and I assumed it would never actually come out.
    definitely feels like they really only marketed it starting like a week before early access release
    It's cool, I hadn't heard about it until like 3 days ago either. I've also never played a survival or Pokemon game, so I guess it makes sense. I did end up buying it though cuz a bunch of people in my clan and Steam friends list bought it. I played for about 3 hours last night before I had to go to sleep and I was really enjoying it. Looking forward to starting to play it again today very soon.
    A lot of YouTubers have been playing it lately too. 

I‚Äôm always skeptical when YouTubers who are known to do paid reviews or plays start pushing a game.
Picked it up last night knowing almost nothing about it (because a friend invited me to co-op). It's definitely Pokemon ARK. It's hella fun with friends. No idea how the single player mode will hold up.
    I‚Äôve played by myself because my friends would rather watch than join in (even though it‚Äôs only $20ish!). Still pretty fun, though I imagine it takes a lot more time to accomplish things.

            You‚Äôre right! Gonna have to let em know.
                The gamepass version is not compatible with steam version right now. It‚Äôs 3 months outdated.
            You pay for gamepass, it's not free on gamepass.

Free on gamepass would be if it were a free trial of gamepass, which they are much stricter about now.
    Since you can adjust most settings, you can make solo not so painful and keep the fun you'd have in coop, just without the other players
You‚Äôre the first person I‚Äôve seen mention Ark. 30 seconds into the game and I felt it was like Ark.
    ive never actually played palword but its very obviously got ark influence. U catch creature make creature stronger make little base, in ark u catch dinosaur make dinoasaure stronger make little base
The game is incredibly fun but people need to stop comparing the automation to Factorio.
    Yeah no one cares
        I do because I want the game to commit to the automation parts better earlier on in base development. Like let me set shit like spheres to just produce an infinite amount at workbenches so that they‚Äôll be made whenever the resources are available.
            This! And a filter for chests... God I hate when my Pals put a pile of wood and stone in EVERY chest in my base...
        I do because that's completely misrepresenting what the game actually is...
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as simple as people want to play Pokemon on PC, there‚Äôs loads of games that do that. Nexomon, Coromon, Cassette Beasts, Tem Tem, Monster Harvest etc‚Ä¶

I think it‚Äôs just that it takes Pokemon and Survival Games and pushes it to the absurd. Like Pokemon with guns and you can force them to work, like the concept was so ridiculous I knew from trailer 1 I was going to buy this regardless because I had to experience it for myself even if it sucked.
    Making the Pals work is something that should be more common in the Pok√©mon games, we already know that's how that world works, but they don't ever really lean into it.
        We always play as a child in the pokemon games.
            But we rarely see mons working in the world,not just for the protagonist. Every so often we might see Machamp being used for construction, but given what the creatures can do, the Pok√©mon world should look like the Flintstone world, where the creature's abilities are used in everyday life.
        Yeah, iirc there has onely been one gen where you can make your boxed pokemon "work" is in gen 7 with the poke pelago. Strangely enough it never returned, like many other things in pokemon.
I don't think people are downvoting those comments because they think they're wrong, more because they're incredibly obvious and pointless to point out in the first place. In what universe does any game ever get big without a boost on social media, twitch, youtube etc?

Among Us for example is a game that wasn't particularly huge until it got a massive boost from people playing it on YouTube and Twitch. Elden Ring for example was also huge on twitch and youtube, but that was because so many people were playing it that naturally streamers and youtubers were too. League of Legends is still one of the most streamed games on Twitch, but is that advertising or is it just because a lot of people play league of legends and want to watch other people play it too?

It just feels so petty and unnecessary to go "oh it's because everyone on social medias are talking about it while youtubers and streamers play it all the time" like yeah... that's how popular games tend to go. Gaming journalists will write about currently trending games and content creators tend to make content about currently trending games. It'd be insanely weird if Palworld had 1 million current players but no relevancy on social medias or youtube/twitch.
    Yeah but in this case palworld had very little to  almost no marketing the whole time. It only got popular because it's a solid game and people on twitch and other socials showed off the game and its a fairly cheap price point.
I'm fine with it "ending" or being able to "beat it" eventually. I can't have every game I play be the type of game where I have to log in at least once or twice a week to do whatever new stuff is available, like in Destiny 2. 

For the ~30 bucks they the game costed, I'm fine if I get maybe a couple hundred hours out of the game, beat all the content the game has to offer, and stop playing for a while until they release a big content update or something, which I'm sure they'll do every once in a while since it's still in Early Access.
Part of the downvoted comments are just people mindlessly hating and just saying "kids lmao"

the other part of the downvoted comments are the ones trying to bring up drama that nobody cares about.

The reality is that the vast majority of the consumer base in ANY industry are massive casuals.

They don't go to reddit to talk about games. They don't look up reviews. They don't investigate drama surrounding a company. 

They just care about whether or not the game is fun.

--------------------

You have a ton of people trying to create drama surrounding this game regarding the CEO's opinion on AI, the so called plagiarism of pokemon and how the company MIGHT have employed AI to create things, but the reality?

Most people don't give a shit, and rightfully so.

Life is too stressful already for most of us. I come home from work and I sit down to play this game with my friends, and we all have fun doing it. That is all I care about.
Hasn't it been early access for like 4 years and the devs say it will be at least another year? üò¨
    Hmmm I don‚Äôt think so , it was announced in 2021 but it literally just became public early access like 2 days ago
The fans still buy it and complain about it.
    two different groups
        Well I‚Äôm in both. Not anymore though. I can‚Äôt be f‚Äôed to play the second half of SV DLC. It not fun. I won‚Äôt be buying the next game if it‚Äôs as crappy. Guess I‚Äôll only be I. The complaining group then.
>Nintendo not doing what fans want

My dude, Scarlet and Violet didn't "do what the fans want" and sold over 23 million copies. Sword and Shield was the original dexit gen and sold 26 million copies. 

I definitely have issues with how Nintendo/GameFreak treats the pokemon franchise, but at the end of the day I think people have to recognize that it's an absolute juggernaut of a franchise that's primarily aimed towards children. There's no way they jeopardize that by giving Pikachu a gun.
Tooting
Honestly that sounds fun. Sometime Nintendo games are too neutered.

Edit: downvoted for such a tame comment. Fanboys gonna fanboy
    it's pretty fun! I've played the cracked version for a bit, but I'll wait for the full released. I can't with early access games anymore.
    femboys gonna femboy
Lol elegant refined gameplay centric games.
    Eh, I get what they‚Äôre driving at. SM64 is kind of the archetype for this. That game is pretty mechanically barebones compared to the average modern AAA game or even a newer 3D Mario game, and there‚Äôs not a ton going on plot-wise. What is there is so polished and well-made that it set the standard for high-quality 3D platforming, and still holds up pretty well almost 30 years later.
    Did Nintendo write that? Lol
    Is it not? I'm not a Nintendo fan, but they do seem to prioritize tight controls in all their games. Odyssey's Mario feels silky smooth to control, but the story is just... Is it even there?

Botw as well. Everyone loved the physics and the exploration but you'd be hard-pressed someone who liked the main story lol
    Nintendos first party titles are the definition of refined gameplay. Nintendo has literally held on the ballsacks of gamers since the NES. Anyone much like yourself who think otherwise forget the fact that Pokemon isn‚Äôt developed in house and GameFreak is not in fact a Nintendo developer. They are 3rd party. 

Name me any in house first party Nintendo Franchise that isn‚Äôt highly acclaimed and loved across the board?
        Sure buddy, sure.
            Keep being butthurt buddy. Keep being butthurt üòÇ
    Gamefreak? No. Nintendo? Yes.
    I think Nintendo treats their fans like shit, but their games do usually have good gameplay.
Third on what list? All franchises like McDonald's or? It's the number 1 media franchise.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises
    Dude the Gap between 1st and 2nd it's huge wft
        Gotta catch em all (all the $$$, that is)
Same, dropped ark with frustration after having 30 hours played, got frustrated of the bugs, the crashes to desktop, losing my tame to a lvl 30 alpha raptor. This game relieves me from all those frustating moments from day one and it performs better in every aspect.
I didn't realize you could capture humans. I had a few raid my base too.
The sub is getting absolutely slammed by shills right now. Look at how many people who have never participated here are making threads about the player numbers.
You get a musket at like level 20-21 though, no?
Also there is like no gore, so everyone can stream it without issues and make content,

also it being open world means content creators make their own drama which can be endless.

and personally, no performance issues,crashes or game breaking bugs which is rare these days.
I‚Äôm level 22 with 3 types of guns?
    Level 26 here with a pokemon on my head with a gun lol
Btw there‚Äôs a new ark though, made in unreal engine 5. Way better graphics and it‚Äôs like 80 gigs, but in some cases is unstable as fuck and tends to crash. I hadn‚Äôt had any issues though and even I with a 1660Ti could run it (which for ark is wild). But yeah just letting you know ark is not that storage hungry anymore (for now). 

Also if you didn‚Äôt know it existed and are interested in ark then check it out, it has new features in comparison to the original one, like crossplatform modding and so on.
Right? I prefer Stanley's Bucket. :D
You actually tried it? I thought the same before because I hate survival games with all parts of my body but this game is kinda different
Yeah exactly,  holy shit this thread is going off the rails lol
Apart from 1 trailer at TGA, majority never heard of it.
    fair most of my friends and discord groups i am in were raving about it for years so i assumed it was mostly known :)
        Aha yeah I had never heard of it until it released, but I've been having a good time with it
            My friends and I played Craftopia before PalWorld was announced and that was a shit ton of ridiculous fun (I fully recommend it, don't listen to those that say it's been EA for 3+ years as being a bad thing). Then we saw PalWorld and we were hyped about that game ever since!
Yeah it doesn't seem to have any sort of content to it other than just pokemon but with guns. I don't see it sticking around
    You played it? It's already sold millions of times on day one and many people never watch twitch from these buyers.
    What do you mean it dosent have content? I've been playing it a lot with plenty more to do without much of a grind too, unless you are some god gamer and a luck lod beating every boss with the basic bow and catching each with the first ball i doubt many people have finished the current content yet
You played it?
Wait until you read about the company and generative ai art usage.
    Why dont you elaborate?
        The company I guess also launched a game called craftopia that‚Äôs been in EA for 3 years and slightly abandoned. The art for the pals is generative a.i. look it up yo lol. Like the games fun. But I have a feeling after a few days the honey moon phase and immense copy paste and lack of depth and content will take its toll and people will be quite bored by the end of the week once they start to peel back the curtain and realize how shallow the content is.
            Do you even look into anything you're saying? Craftopia is still very much supported. Was updated last month even. Also a separate dev team than Palworld. The AI I don't know much about but not sure why that would be an issue if true.  These games aren't meant to be played forever. You soak up all the content and move on to something else. Check back in in six months or a year and do another play thru with new content. Rinse and repeat
                I will likely never understand people expecting infinite replayability from every game, most games are good to complete once and be done or maybe pick up much later to give it another run through.
>But the way they put the pieces together is just something else

not really. But the way they put the pieces together is just something else

craftopia game is not the best and has many problems. Pal is full of red flags.  
But nothing surprises me if starfield was popular, or the day before.
    I got my money's worth of entertainment already and I haven't even left the starting zone yet. If they don't abandon it, that's just going to keep adding value to my 26 dollar purchase. To me, joy is worth more than a "perfect" game.
        I know that. This is why most game developers have stopped trying to make good games. 3.5 years ago they released a survival game with the "pokeball" mechanics in early access. That game is still on EA, and yet they released palworld, another survival game with "pokeballs" on EA.
Haven‚Äôt played it yet but I‚Äôve been hearing the survival aspect leaves you wanting to learn and experience the new crafting items as you progress vs sticking with the same crafting items over and over again. I‚Äôve also heard that the survival element becomes less of a center focus so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm interested despite not loving survival games.
    Trust me, I'm HATING survival games (Minecraft, ark and all of them!!!), don't wanted to try palworld, for my brother I'm played it with him ... 9 hours straight without a pause now ...

Early you need to build up some things, eat some Berry's and farm wood or stone but after you settled down an easy base and catched some pals, they do all the work complete alone, we leveld, build and crafted for like 3 hours and after that, we was just exploring for 6 hours straight without any survival aspect (even eating is automatic after you have the item for it).
We already Slain 12 bosses and catched like 80 different pals, it's amazing.

It's more natural and intuitive and easy to understand, I would say the survival part feels like a game feature and not work.
Game pass won't affect steam numbers
Shows that you should never give up with your goals.
Can you elaborate on the survival aspect? From what I've seen that just means base building
    Survival usually means game aspects like hunger and temperature are something you have to manage while doing other parts of the game but it is often paired with the base building tag as they tend to fit well together with making large bases to automate or at least efficiently manage those survival needs
Or 30y old virgins
    I am neither of those, so why do I enjoy it? The same with a bunch of my friends
well if they have fun with it, why not
    True. As long as it won't affect other developers. You can play whatever you want, its your money.
        who cares if it does affect other developers, they will start making fun games too?
            No. They will stop actually making clever designs and settle for 5 minute craft videogames and hope it reaches the same level of funny meme. 

Not every genre of videogames can be made with free UE5 assets and AI generating enemies.
                Developers already do that on their own or are you one of those COD players
                    And how exactly does further enabling to do shitty games help that case?
Keep in mind, *everyone* plays games now. Once execs figured out that kids are the ones spending the money they started spending more on marketing and microtransactions that targeted a far younger demographic. 

You see a lot of games now that half is goofy Dreamworks-like aesthetic that‚Äôs cartoony even in games that take themselves seriously.
probably because this one is fun
No one is forcing you to play early access games, but if you want to hate at least bring genuine criticism
Congratulations, you haven't played it and have judged it off 10 seconds of pictures
Please, elaborate
    On PC it plays like a really cheep console port.  You can't rotate angled wall tiles for roofing, and the interface is complete ass. I made it about an hour before I had better things to do.  Thank goodness I played on Gamepass and didn't pay 40 bucks for it.
        Can't say I've done much with angled walls but I've found the interface simple enough and easy to use even with a lacking tutorial I've been able to figure it all out and I've only played around 10 hours so far with plenty more to explore
god you must be a miserable person be around with
    Bet he hasn't even played it
    Better to be around smart peole than sick pokemon fans. 

Minority > Majority

You are like mosquitos and ants, you are always together and can just bite and cry.

Are you ashamed being POKEMON fan? You like cute little doggos and dragons in small little cute red ball? Oh, wow <3 Puki moooooooon
        Plenty of people who play this aren't Pok√©mon fans, what are you on?
        Ah..to be 12 again. Fun times. You'll grow up, buddy. It's okay.
I think your brackets should be (my opinion is garbage)
Game looks amazing, wtf.
Proof of the stolen content?
I've seen this multiple times but can't find anything to be honest
    https://imgur.com/a/gFIhOHg

You downvote even proofs now? Holy shish you flat earth bois are insane
        whats wrong with them making similar creatures in their game?
        Nintendog fan boys are here.
Um you are some kind of ambassador of good taste in games or what?   Just because it doesnt appeal to you means it doesnt makes sense it appeals to alot of other players?

Stop acting like you have moral authority on what should be popular when its clearly subjective.
    [deleted]
        Your problem is you're conflating an aesthetic with quality level. Realism != Good.

The reason this game has the aesthetic it does is because it's inspired by a franchise heavily entwined with anime and made by Japanese devs that are probably fans of anime themselves.

The fact you think that visual style is the biggest indicator of the quality of a game is evidence that, ironically, it's you who is simple minded and easily appeased, having a childish mindset. Shiny thing is not always better (and this game is actually shiny, just in a different font than you deem acceptable, apparently).
Eh, I‚Äôd much rather play a genuinely fun game with mid-tier graphics than a beautiful game with mid-tier gameplay. 

So many games these days look amazing, but the controls aren‚Äôt right, they‚Äôre just plain boring, or they‚Äôre bogged down with microtransactions. 

I‚Äôm not defending or praising Palworld btw.
    But roblox is ass on all fronts. That was my point. Also, hey kids, its ok that you played shitty games. Nobody will look down on you for that
        Sadly, AAA games these days are usually creatively stunted and plagued with monetization. Thing is, this is all the younger generations know. 

*Most* of them didn‚Äôt grow up playing Deus Ex, Diablo 1-2, or Half Life 1-2. It‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre missing if you never experienced it. 

The gaming industry is far, FAR more corporate than it was say even 15 years ago. Now more money is spent on marketing than crafting a storyline or making sure the gameplay is fun.
no one asked
    You dumb? OP asked.
        you dumb? He asked for something else
            Fuck off
I‚Äôve only seen Palworld gameplay so I‚Äôm not in the know, but could you elaborate why?

An EA game with negative reviews is going to be trash. At least Palworld *may* be fun.
Agree lol
What exactly are you talking about?
    One of their previous games was based on the concept of AI art. It was a shitty game and mostly negative on Steam.
        actually its mostly positive on steam, do your research first
            I think you should do yours: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154230/AI\_Art\_Impostor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154230/AI_Art_Impostor/?curator_clanid=41648656)

If you read my comment thoroughly you could see I was not talking about Palworld.
                I thought you are talking about craftopia. Well its good then that palworld has nothing to do with this AI game
ARK players, too. I have fond memories of that game, but it‚Äôs so janky and such a pain in so many ways. Palwork takes out a lot of the friction from Ark (like long taming times and limited abilities to automate dinosaurs working).¬†
    I‚Äôm a current ark player and the amount of ex tribe mates that are begging me to come play is ridiculous
        lmao same. this game in my opinion has a chance to be almost as big or bigger than ark
            It already dwarfs Ark like the sun dwarfs the Earth
    And Palworld is only a fraction of the GBs Ark takes.
        I was wondering about that. Why does Ark take so much disk space, makes no sense
            Just terrible optimization
            Lots of it is the maps, you can reduce the space by only installing some of them.  The game has like 10 different world maps that are pretty detailed and a lot of extra data tied to them plus unique textures.
        69 likes
    All of that is completely customizable in Ark. How could you not be aware of that?
This is true. My wife is not a gamer, but she played for 15 hours straight yesterday.
It has co-op?
    yes, up to 32 players
        I would say there is co-op up to 4 people and then there are servers with 32 players. I have not tried pal world solo with friends but I'm playing on a dedicated server with friends
It's like a Among us/Fall guys/ Lethal company kinda game, There is one of those every year lmao
    except those games never even came close to Dota 2, dota 2s all time peak is 1,295,114 and Palworlds is 1,291,967. Palworld only came out 3 days ago and I hadn't ever heard of it before yesterday, How tf is all this possible? especially since when looking at gameplay and trailers it doesn't look like anything special, on top of that is $40???  its literally the most-played paid game of all time how does this make sense.

edit: the above number is the peak player count on steam alone
        And it launched on game pass, and those numbers don‚Äôt even include game pass, that‚Äôs the really insane detail that no one is mentioning.
        Damn I knew it was a big deal but not THAT big of a deal, this is insane lmao

can anyone who has played it let us know if the game is actually good? XD
        PUBG hit 3mil+ when it was paid back in 2018, so idk about that?
            Damn, I forgot abt that i thought it was always free for some reason, no one seems to be mentioning it. Ive seen game news sites say Palworld's the most played paid game of all time,

  Regardless tho 2nd place is still insane. Pubg was literally impossible to miss back then, same with games like among us i mean literally every single creator I watched was playing these games, but I haven't seen almost anyone posting vids about Palword even now a couple of days after ea release. I just don't get how the game's so dang popular
        >and I hadn't ever heard of it before yesterday, How tf is this all possible?

You just dont spend any time on Twitter, Twitch or Youtube.  Period.  That wasnt really that difficult to deduce.  If you're not on the internet, you're not going to hear about things.  Pretty simple concept I would say.
What's your age range? Cus I look at the videos for this game and it looks like a game made for teens tbqh. But I guess you late 20 early 30 peeps were into Pokemon too.
100% Agreed people comparing it to Pokemon is basically a buzz word now.
    It's far more like ark in gameplay than Pokemon, but ANY creature collection game gets compared to Pokemon.

            Palworld is not in an active lawsuit with Nintendo.
                My bad, Nintendo is in the process of finalizing their lawsuit because palworld is in clear copyright violation ü§¶ use commonsense
                    What exactly are they in violation of? I highly doubt Palworld would've even hit market if they had grounds for litigation given it was anmounced im 2021. The person who was selling mods using their IP already got a cease and desist.

Also copyright infringement isn't a common sense thing. Or maybe it is to you. Are you a patent lawyer?  

Even if they did sue it doesn't mean they would win either. The proof would have to be incontrovertible and I've yet to see anything unless you know something nobody else does.
                        Not to mention the headlines for palworld is "Pok√©mon with guns", like hello??? Doesn't take a rocket scientist ü§¶
                            Those are journalists who write those headlines not the developers...
                            Absolutely nowhere on the game does it say that, dude you ate so full of shit. Every sentence you have made on this post is pure lies. Just because you read some person on the internet saying it's pokemon with guns doesn't mean it's official palworld news. You are either 12 or just an idiot

"While it is significant that The Pok√©mon Company issued a statement about this situation, the way it reads does not really imply anything much would probably happen here. Nintendo has says they haven‚Äôt licensed any IP or assets to Palworld which I mean, of course they didn‚Äôt."

"As for IP, clearly no actual terms or exact characters from Pok√©mon are being used. Nintendo immediately got a Pok√©mon reskin mod for Palworld taken down when it went live, and I cannot see them having much of a case comparing two electric mice and proving that the concept infringes on Pikachu. You can‚Äôt copyright the concept of an electric mouse."

"Palworld was also in development for many years before this so this is not exactly news to The Pok√©mon Company and Nintendo that this game and its Pok√©mon-adjacent monsters exist. This reads like a statement that they should probably say something given how big this game has gotten, though I would be amazed if this ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù turned up anything that could cause real harm to Palworld, which at the time of this writing, has just passed eight million copies sold in six days."
                        It's just commonsense buddy, a game that has nothing to do with Nintendo comes out with a game that has "Pok√©mon" that are basically ripping off Pok√©mon; sorry you can't piece that together?
                            I only responded to you because you said they were in the middle of an active lawsuit which is verifiably untrue. Idk why youre being a dick about it. 

"Basically" doesn't sound iron clad to me personally. If it was so open and shut then sales would likely *already* be blocked and it would be incredibly easy to point out where exactly the infringement is. Palworld isn't the first game to use the catching monsters concept and Pok√©mon wasn't the first. Do you have actual examples? Have you played the game? 

The person who did side by sides on blender of 3D models that went viral already recanted their statements and admitted to exaggerating the similarities. 

Could Nintendo sue? Sure. Anyone can sue anyone for anything. Do they have grounds? It doesn't seem like it, but I suppose we will see. I just highly doubt Nintendo would've let Palworld sell 6 million copies if it's as cut and dry as you are implying.
            No its not you just completely made that shit up.
    That's because most people are like OP, they only know it from a few images.
Hopefully this will show them that the fans will clamor for something more than the old formula and Game Freak will maybe change things up.
    I mean they did something good with Arceus so if they could expand on that by about ten fold then we could have a really decent game.
        Arceus is like the beta test to what Palworld is.
            Arceus is like bedof and palworld is like arceus
    Oh they know, but since the stuff they keep pushing out sells just fine, they don't care
        It‚Äôs crazy that capitalism or whatever you want to call it, evolved Pokemon to this point. The amount of money they are missing out on by taking risks making good products over safe bets‚Ä¶.who knows
            Pokemon Violet in all it's shoddy, bland glory sold 23.2 MILLION copies. Nintendo isn't missing out on anything.
    Pokemon fans have been hoping that for years upon years now. Everytime a new monster collecting game gets popular, nothing changes.
        Because the games sell. The adults who‚Äôve been playing for years can‚Äôt let go, and parents buy for their kids. The simple nature of story is friendly for young children dipping into JRPGS, while online battling tends more to the long time players, or even shiny hunting. People complain about the system, but remember. The franchise that was only supposed to be one game, is still marking millions of sales. SwSh and SV despite being ‚Äúhated‚Äù are second and third respectively in sales behind the original games.
    they're an Japanese company, like hell they'll change.
they "can't/won't" make it because it was never the purpose of pokemon.  


Pokemon always been a children game. An entry milestone in video game. Your first mythic triple A game.   


It was not ment to be 20 years story arc with each extension answering the previous to accompany a loser from 7yo to the tomb.  


Pokemon fandom are just degenerates and people asking for mature pokemon games are just failures. You guys can't even comprehend these simple things and are simping on a zero effort game ripping off everything from UI to DA and mechanics.   


You are just pathetic manchild, lol, grow up mother fucker.
I also missed it and I am always looking for new exciting games literally everywhere, i don't understand how it's so popular, I had never even heard of it before yesterday
Drop the survival aspect and I'd been more interested tbh.

The itch I have is a more grown up jrpg version, arceus was in the right direction
    You can drop most of the survival aspects in settings.
        Survival only plays a role early. Once you have your first berry farm you have infinite food. Maybe in the future they change stuff because right now that's all you need. You don't even need water.

What is nice though is that your Pokemon get sick and you have to craft medicine. Or catch a new one too replace the slave hahaha
            Strict up survival is pretty tame that is true, however it comes with many gameplay aspects that are generally used in survival games like based building, lots of farming etc. The core Gameplay-loop is more like a survival than a Pokemon game.
        I‚Äôm having a lot more fun since doing this. Can‚Äôt be bothered with survival games where you‚Äôre constantly battling hot/cold and hunger.
            The problem for me is they always make the hunger deplete way too fast. Same with thirst if implemented. I know you can change it in settings but my first playthrough has been just normal to get the hang of things.

Catching pals is pretty damn easy. Caught lvl 15 dinos and a lvl 15 deer at lvl 7. Also caught a lvl 11 giant bird. All at lvl 7. 

The punk looking Dino kid is a pretty good companion for catching other pals. 

It would be really cool to be able to have all 5 pals out following you.
        Is it still fun as a single player game?
            I've only played alone so far and I'm having fun. hoping my friends decide to get it at some point to try co-op
            Haven't touched multiplayer yet and probably never will except for when my wife finally has time and the mental energy to play but solo has been an absolute blast.
            I hear one of the main reasons single player works so well with this game is thanks to the pals, since you will neither feel alone nor will have to do all the work of resource gathering by yourself since you have, well, you know, your pals.
            It‚Äôs server to server, so solo is for your intense grind and base building and then multiplayer is just to chill on
                No?

You just have 1 friend host an open server so you and your friends can drop in and out at any time 24/7.

 That's where the real fun of these games lie.
        Explain

No way I got down voted because I wanted to know something lol

            Money can be *exchanged* for goods and services!
                God damn it you beat me too it.
            You can adjust difficulty and the various difficulty gives or takes away things that add to the game. Or you can set a custom difficulty like enemy HP or ATK exp and things of that nature. I can‚Äôt remember the full list of settings but you can change it to how you want to play.
    The game is extremely customizable. You can tune almost every setting to the point you can drastically limit survival elements to be trivial.
    Try it, it's everything people wanted arceus to be. Survival is there but after the beginning it takes less relevance.
        Yeah it honestly isnt really survival. You kill one pal every now and again if you're hungry, normal difficulty hunger drain is basically negligible
            You don't even need to kill Pals for food once you get the Pal that produces berries for you. In our private server, between the 5 of us, we all have at least 100 cooked berries on each of us and at least 150 in our food basket and another 200+ in the fridge
            an hour in you get a feed bag also that auto fees.
            You realize you can have chickens hatch eggs for you right?
        I did on gamepass, I found the tutorial borderline useless as it didn't explain how to do things just what to do. Even eating food took pressing every button trying to figure out which worked. Everything felt and looked unfinished. Hearing the survival aspect drops off it nice to hear tho

Maybe in a few patches, but I'm aware the gamepass version is wya before the steam. Version
            The game has a section in the options called survival guide. It explains most of the things.
            To each their own, but I‚Äôm genuinely sick of long winded tutorials that I‚Äôm forced to complete. This game has a short quick one that in theory you don‚Äôt even have to do. I rate that highly. Let me work stuff out for myself, sick of being told how to do absolutely EVRRYTHING in every game I play. Let me learn it myself if I want to. (I understand some want full tutorials, but more games need to make it optional)
    Digimon Cyber Sleuth is what you‚Äôre looking for.
        Such a great game. Was not expecting how dark some of the cases got.

Edit: Think I still need to actually beat it and start the 2nd game.
            I was not expecting Hacker's Memory to be as good as it was, but it's a really interesting story and it's fun how it intersects with the main story of Cybersleuth.
        This is something that has interested me, need to check how it runs on deck
    The settings basically allow you to remove the survival aspect
    I just change the world settings to not deal with the survival aspects since I also hate survival games. 

Honestly this game would be so much better if it didn't lean so far into the survival part.
        >Honestly this game would be so much better if it didn't mean so far into the survival part.

After a few hours, your Pals start automating everything for you. All we do now is explore, do dungeons, capture more Pals, and fight bosses
            How do I get them to stop ADD'ing out? They do a 1/10th of a task and then go do something else
                lift them and throw them at the task you want them to do, you can see the task assigning to them when you hold the throw button
                I've found that you need to get the Pals that can *only* do one or two things. If they can do everything, they'll try to do everything. Also, if you pick them up and throw them onto a task, it will assign them to it
                Make sure to have clear pathways between tasks, chests and other spots they go to. There are very annoying hitboxes on few stuff you build that will block pathing and fuck with AI, also they care a lot about the way stuff is facing so don't build stations facing wall on 4th floor. 

On my 2nd playthrough(wanted to restart to try stuff out) I went straight away to big flat zone and built a lot of wooden floor before even placing my tablet.
    I wonder if the survival stuff can be modded out or turned off in the menus. I avoid survival crafting bs like it's a disease. But I love the idea of open world exploration with Pok√©mon like companion and guns... although I don't really want to shoot them.
        Killing Pals is the best part! Or putting them to work on your compound. 

You can host a server and change the hunger options and edit the game rules.
    This was me, downloaded and jumped in, within 15 minutes I got over-encumbered and thought, nah, I ain't doing this again.  I loved the idea of Pokemon with guns.  Can't be bothered with another survival game where you have to play for hours before you can do fun stuff
Yeah ive wanted slavery for so long in pokemon of course.
    That's always been there? You catch a wild animal and force it to fight for you until it passes out from pain. How's that any different here?
        In Pokemon it was presented more as a "partnership" after the initial taming; in Palworld there is no ambiguity.
            Partnership... Except for the hundreds of Pokemon you have sitting in stasis. 

Gotta catch em all, to sit in a void for all eternity? 

Dark as fuck.
            Except for those two games that basically called it slavery...
            It's not slavery because they like it  
They smile therefore it's not Stockholm syndrome

Pok√©mon games are weird man  
Even if they try to make it ambiguous and friendly, the whole concept has always been weird when you look at it 

Oh well, I'm having fun with palworld now
    Pok√©mon MASTER
funny because this was the theme of Pokemon Black and white. Goated games imo and easily the peak of pokemon.
    People say that but they kinda immediately throw out that theme and it turns out the whole "free Pok√©mon" movement was just a conspiracy set up by the team rocket of that game and Pok√©mon actually like being subjugated or something.
less so but it kinda is. pokemon is more like taming but yeah you could say it is also slavery as some are smarter.
Yeah I don't get all this slavery nonsense in palworld. Was funny the first couple of times I heard it and now it's just annoying. I can't see how I'm treated any different to these pals by my government and Apparently I'm far from a slave
    wait until all of your pals have developed eating disorders and refuse to work, so you ceremoniously butcher one of them to send a message to the others
        If by ceremonically you mean merging all the shit pals into one pal, and then butchering that pal in front of them while they're eating breakfast
        Isn't that what employers basically do when staff are under performing in the real world? Threaten them with the sack which leads to no money which leads to starvation?
    People ruin their underwear over GTA6 but apparently this game has slavery in it even though all my guys got endless food and a jacuzzi to chill in
    I mean, you can literally capture humans and sell them so...

Edit: idk who down voted me, but I'm dead serious. Any NPC in game minus the tower bosses are capturable
        Well. Technically they are not humans and they are not on planet earth, it's just fantasy. they are just pixels and you can do this sort of stuff in loads of games. It isn't like the game forces you to do that you do it you are making them slaves out of your own will. Much worse goes on in games like rust and ark.¬†
            I don't recall anyone saying you're forced to capture the NPCs? Just that you can, and given that they are shaped like a human, act like a human, and speak like a human, its relatively easy to compare it to slavery as a joke. Especially since the humans sell so damn well üòÇ 500 or so gold per. 

But really, you're taking a joke about the games mechanics a little personally. If you don't wanna capture the syndicate dudes and just wanna kill them, go for it. Play how you want to
    Bro, you are approaching the point. You are a wage slave. Read Anarchist literature and watch Zeitgeist Addendum & Zeitgeist Moving Forward. Trust me.
I mean that's like asking how Lethal Company got popular when it was a single person project and got into steam's top 10 by concurrent players. Some games just get lucky and spread from person to person & get picked up by youtubers/tik-tok.

Success is 50% luck and 50% effort.
    I'd say more than 50% luck these days, especially when you're a solo dev with no spare money for advertising. Posts on reddit might get a few players but likely not enough to boost you into visibility, and twitter no chance unless you already had a following, which is unlikely for most people.
        You think getting one of the highest played games is luck? I dunno man. I would say the game needs to be pretty damn good.
            No, I think regardless of effort if you're unlucky your game will go nowhere. You can have the greatest idea and solid execution, and it doesn't matter if nobody finds your game.  

The lethal companies of game releases are one in tens of thousands, if not more.
                Maybe. Do you have any examples of really solid games that never got any traction?
                    Off the top of my head, no. That said, once the next steam next fest rolls around you could look at the steamdb charts for the majority of games that get featured there and you'll find that they either gained only a small temporary influx in sales, or none at all. That isn't to say that every game there is a gem to everyone because that's too subjective, but that many games that could be gems just never get the opportunity/exposure to get to that point.  

So yeah, I'm not saying these people put in no effort and don't deserve their game taking off, just that effort is not a guarantee and without the resources to make large advertising pushes (and even then) there is a significant chance that the game flies completely under the radar.
                        So you have a theory, but no evidence.

I don't completely disagree with you though. I do think some luck is involved as well, but imo the luck really comes down to finding a formula with broad appeal. There probably are solid games with low sales, but they probably don't have broad appeal.

In general though, I think that to even have a chance at being a highly played game, it's gotta be a damn good game.
                            Steps To Getting Downvoted On Reddit

1. Locate a comment that is one (or more) of the following: an overgeneralization, an opinion presented as fact, or an unsupported conclusion

2. Request *any* form of evidence: data, examples, screenshots, tweets, literally anything

3. Once it is clear that no evidence can/will be provided, note that there does not seem to be evidence to support the initial claim.

4. lmaoooo get fucked asshole LOL substantiated claims are BORING and for fuckin' NERDS get out of here with your reasonable discourse

5. DAE feel like 2+2 actually = 5???
                    I can give you 3 - which of course are my subjective opinions (otherwise the games would be popular obviously lol)

Shadowrun (2007) Xbox/PC - one of the very first cross-platform FPS games, has a 'buy system' similar to CS:GO, and abilities like that of Overwatch or Valorant (teleport dash through wall/floor, place a tree of healing) 

\[personally, teleporting through walls in an FPS game in 2007 was so cool and revolutionary to me\]

- maybe it was just too ahead of its time, but apparently I just read that the servers are still live and running

Battleborn (2016) PS/Xbox/PC - I believe this to be the best example in terms of luck. They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms. It was a 5v5 team based game sort of like LoL in the sense of PvPvE where you can capture points to get AI to fight alongside you (I think that's how LoL works, at least) - but it was First Person, and the first time anything like this released on console.

- unfortunately for them, they released their game within 21 days of one of the most popular games of all time, Overwatch, so lots of direct comparisons were made between the 2 FPS games.. and only one survived in the end

Blazing Sails (2021) \[2023 official release\] PC - you show this game to a Sea of Thieves diehard and after 4 seconds they will call it a knockoff and dismiss it, which is what happened at the game's launch. I played SoT only a couple times, and while I admired the graphics and mechanics - I quickly lost interest after discovering that majority of the gameplay is PvE oriented, extremely repetitive, and lacks hardly any variables in the game (only 3 different guns, 1 melee weapon... this still stands true 6 years later)

(I am biased, I am not going to try to pretend otherwise lol) 

- this is why I was excited to come across Blazing Sails.. it is everything I wish SoT was. It removes the PvE aspect out of the game, leaving only fast paced PvP left. And most notably, the game is objectively 100x better in the area that has been SoT's #1 most well known issue for 6 years running now: Hit Registration. The game also launched with I believe around 12+ weapons, so it already had more depth in terms of variables (currently 21+ weapons) 

The hit reg in this game is one of the best I've seen in a game, which surprised me for an indie cartoon pirate game. I used to be active in the game's discord when it first came out and told the devs how good the hit reg was, especially in comparison to SoT.. and that it should be one of the main selling points

I believe it to be a combination of bad luck in terms of not gaining any traction, not having any big streamers play, as well possibly bad marketing in distinguishing themselves from SoT from the start. It is one of the few games I've seen on Steam that has a 90% rating, and nearly every negative review is about there being a lack of players, not the actual game itself.

Blazing Sails just released their official trailer a couple months ago, and the last line of it is "...so feast your eyes on an Indie game, so eye-watering, you'll mistake the work of one family of 4 in Belgium, for that of hundreds in a multi-national, AAA studio - then gasp in utter disbelief at which one actually delivers accurate hit reg"
                        > They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms.

Just wanted to say you reminded me of Monday Night Combat. A TPS-MOBA. I freaking loved that game!
                            dude.. what!?- how have I never seen that game?

I just watched some videos, and that looks way ahead of its time.. idk how I haven't seen that before :o
                        Yeah, there's definitely games that are overhyped and there's definitely games that are underhyped, and luck definitely IS a part of it...

The problem is that the entire conversation is sort of hamstrung by the fact that "Luck" is such a nebulous concept. Like, we all more or less know what we mean by "luck", except there's a lot of real-world complexity that the word "luck" hand-waves away--albeit unintentionally.

To use a recent example, is it luck that Lies of P was such an unexpected smash hit yet Lords of the Fallen had an ambivalent, mostly lukewarm reception? 

Sort of? But what do i/we mean by "luck" in this instance, right? We're not just saying "oh yeah, it's a total dice roll"... Realistically, the "luck" came from the fact that Lies of P was a unique blend of ideas (Fairy Tale x Souls), part of it came from the fact that it was--in many people's estimation--the first game to go toe-to-toe with FromSoft's combat design. 

And so there's a luck factor to that: Because Lies of P came out a couple weeks prior to LotF, people perhaps evaluated LotF more critically than they would have if Lies of P hadn't come out at all. 

But IS that luck? Hard to say, because there were a million-billion decisions made along the way that led to the outcome that we now might refer to as "lucky" or "unlucky"

Idk, not really agreeing or disagreeing, just find it an interesting topic.
                The mentality that everything comes down to luck is cope. Success is earned.
For me a trailer popped up on YouTube like 2 years ago and I've had it wishlisted ever since. Sometimes a concept and timing is all you need for word of mouth to take over.
So, I came across this game about 4 years ago. I can't even remember how ( maybe YouTube), but I had no idea if it was ever going to come to light. Over the past few years, I have seen 2 trailers. I just happened to hop on Steam yesterday, and it dropped in early access. I dropped what I was doing because I got so excited.
It got shown years ago and I think almost everyone forgot.
Its just leeching of a big franchise, in a hopefully good way. Not that surprising really. the idea is good enough that itll just get traction if you show it to big people. 

Pokemons simply appeal to quite a few people because of how cute they look, the gameplay has also a variety that will appeal to a broad set of people.
    No, I get it. Im just surprised that the game is THIS popular while a small proportion of reddit users know what it is. Also, it's paid so that drastically increases the entry floor, unlike dota 2, and CS2 which used to dominate the chart until this game came out
        Im guessing streamers because this game seems to be the perfect type of game to stream. its cute and has a lot to play around with.
        I've seen three posts about it in the last 24 hours. There's your marketing. Wouldn't be surprised if some percentage of these posts are from the marketing team themselves.
I have had pal world wishlisted for years and have followed it closely. Speak for your self....
I'd assume it got quite a bit of exposure from being Day 1 on GamePass. I saw the trailer from Xbox account marketing this game.
They aren't marketing genious. Video game industry is dead. It is how braindead consumers buy games nowaday. And streamers.   


Most popular games are just empty shells made to milk money from dumbfucks. It's just one of these honkai, genshin, now you have palwords.   


Welcome to modern day, when only video game with 0 interest made with 0 effort. Wich wouldn't have event touch internet culture back in early 2000 now is worldwid success.   


People are zombies who really really like to eat hot turds. Do not respect people, they do not deserv it.
Lol slavery existed in all areas at certain points in time
    Still exists in Africa today
Yeah, the Philippines too bud
We can see why it appeals to people eh?
I guess you skipped History class (unless your country's schools don't offer history classes, if so, my condolences).
No
Yes but more. Factory sweatshops and you can eat them.
    Also you can capture actual people in palworld
        what? lol

players or NPCs?
            NPCs. There's no pvp
                what do NPCs do? are there fixed settlements or are they just other survivors or how does that work?  I find the steam page description rather lacking
                    You can make them a camp slave or make them fight for you like a Pok√©mon. Or you can sell them for a good price to the black market trader.
    lol what?
        Yes that‚Äôs right
DAE
what would you call it? You can literally have monsters, that you capture with balls, which you can put in your pocket (pocket monsters so to speak, aka pokemons), fight for you, while using guns yourself.
Lol dude is getting mad at people innocently describing a game
Buying it as a joke. That's some good stuff
    I'll probably play it.  But I definitely bought it because they went out of their way to make it happen, so I feel like they should reap the rewards.
    It's no joke though, it's actually pretty decent. I mostly enjoy the potion mixing game.
haha my wif bought this one, its awesome! I reaaallly wanted to play those games, but i'd never ever download those pieces of junk on my phone.
    >but i'd never ever download those pieces of junk on my phone.

Then maybe you miss the joke, which is that the game never actually is the one in the ad.  So you download something totally different that isn't what you wanted to play.  This steam game is actually all the games in the ads that are fake games to get you to download.
I need to get that one day lol
I own this and it's great. Wish they'd add a bit more and tweak some of the controls. Otherwise I love it.
Saving this one lmao
From what I've heard from a friend who plays the game, good. It apparently is basically Ark with Pokemon.
    It gives me cube world vibes which i deeply miss.. it looks adorable
        When my penguins haul my wood around they balance it on their head and just kind of bounce around my camp with it. It's adorable and my wife and I are having a blast
        It is adorable. You can actually interact with your Pals and their reactions are so damn cute! It makes you feel even worse for making them work in the quarries or slaughtering the rest of their species :c
Really good! I fucking hate survival games. I started Friday and have played 15 hours on a work weekend. The slavery aspect takes away so much of the busy work with survival games. You need ore? Send that MFing seal to the mine it's great
It's brilliant.i bought it thinking I'll try it out and refund before two hours. I played it for 6 hours straight and I've never done that with a game before. Time just melts away. And it's cute.
I easily got 30 bucks worth of fun the first night I played it, and I haven't even joined my friends server yet.
In a good way. Progression is honestly fun and exploration is cool
while being the most average thing ever made
    Even average games run above 20 FPS and don't rip out features with each iteration.
        Yeah same deal with the FiFAs and CODs, can just push out any garbage when you have a mindless horde buying everything¬†
            Because despite what a lot of people might want to believe, 80% of the Pokemon playerbase are under the age of 14 and have barely any reference to how good the game should be, let alone whether the game is actually any good or not.

When you're a kid any game can be good...
                Not true, the younger generation is almost, if not more, obsessed with retro games now than ever before with help from youtube. It's one of the reasons the old pokemon games won't drop in value, despite having a bazillion copies each, because the newer generations want to re buy gameboys/ds and play those games they missed out on that us adults keep saying were the best.

And God forbid Nintendo re releases them on Switch and make themselves an insurmountable fortune with the profits they'd make.

            Yep, I didn't even buy S/V because it's just such unexcusable dogshit. They then admitted it, after the outrage, and instead of fixing the game, released dlc....bruh. They have zero reason to make the game better so I'll just be sad and not buy their games anymore. I know it doesn't make a difference but there are SO many games that come out that are more worth my time and money
                [deleted]
                    When the spin offs on gamecube have better animations and frame rate then games on the switch, you'd think they'd actually start caring about the quality control. 

It's just such a sad fall from grace seeing every game get worse and worse. Hopefully Nintendo starts spreading the license around more. Until then I'll keep enjoying actual good games like bg3 lol
        I almost think they made exp share mandatory out of spite.¬†
    Average is a huge compliment to those games
Which is so sad. I quit playing after Sun and Moon because quality consistently went down starting with X and Y. I‚Äôve owned every gen since gen 2 and was hoping I‚Äôd one day gift every pokemon I owned to any kids I had.
They have two options:


Spend $80m and sell 20 million copies at $40 each


Put in extra effort, spend $200m and sell 20 million copies at $40 each
    As someone who work in IT. It is hillarious to witness people asking nintendo to make effort. When they created the franchise. The franchise never was to be a story arc extension from extension. It's more like an entry rpg for children and every iteration is addressed to new children, no to 50 yo manchild who played them all.  
You can't even have a grasp on the very existence of the ip but anyway...  


So these Nintendo evil guys are the one puting 0 effort in their game. But on the other hand. Palworld, ripping everything from mechanics, to UI to artistic direction are the one putting in the effort. I guess the climax of these effort were made when they were feeding the pokemon games to their IA.   


Fucking tool. And I'm not a pokemon fan. Fuck pokemon, you're supposed to play one of their game and that's it. Fuck "gamers". Fuck "video game" industry. And all of you enjoying palworlds should commit suicide. You are enjoying the worst turd ever created since NFT games.
        Buying two copies of Palworlds now due to this post. Thanks for the suggestion.
They're not going to sue them since they're not directly ripping the assets off. Yes a good chunk of the pals look a lot like existing pokemon designs but that's not enough of a sway in the Japanese court. If you think Nintendo/TPCi will sue all creature collecting games that gets slightly popular then we would have long heard that they have long sued the likes of Digimon, Yokai Watch, Temtem, Nexomon, Neopets, etc. 

Only those romhacks like Pokemon Uranium gets the letter from the lawyers since those are directly using Nintendo / TPCi assets as it features actual Pokemon IP at the game.
    Plus you can capture humans in Palworld. Can‚Äôt do that in Pok√©mon
I doubt it... creature collecting games are a genre on Steam now. 

Are consumers likely to get confused when purchasing Palworld? It's a survival game with guns. Some of the monsters are similar but are they going to argue in court that a leaf monkey was a rip off of a fire monkey in a different game? Idk.. just doesn't seem like it would hold up in court.

Most game devs have lawyers that they consult on this type of thing so I think it's fine. Temtem is more like Pokemon than Palworld.
Accessibility is not the issue, this much is clear. The real issue is gamefreak and their mismanagement of the game. 

Not enough devs, not enough time, not enough budget. BoTW/ToTK/MPRemake/MarioOddysey are all good games with good graphics that sold well and run perfectly fine most of the time.

Pokemon has is the one major franchise partly owned by Nintendo to not run well and not even because of the graphics. Not to mention its outsold palworld multiple times I've despite being on switch alone.

BDP sold 15m~ copies. Palworld has around 3m~ from what im seeing, this ofcourse is likely to increase within the coming months. Within 6 months is probably the best time to compare these numbers since that's what the source for bdsp said it took to reach 15m.

This still makes it very clear, it being a console exclusive isn't the issue.
    Gamefreak really struggled with the transition to 3D and to the Switch. Their other Switch games (unrelated to Pokemon) also run poorly in many cases. Somewhere there‚Äôs an alternate universe where they stuck with high-quality 2D (like Octopath), but that still doesn‚Äôt address the other game design issues.

I do think some of SV‚Äôs sales were boosted by the SwSh DLC and Arceus. Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra both brought in interesting features that fans enjoyed and it seemed like they were listening to players. Arceus was also an interesting refresh of the formula (didn‚Äôt land for everyone, but it was something that added a lot of neat features like catching pokemon outside of combat).¬†

So I certainly expected that SV would continue that trend. Sadly, it did not, especially since some of the concepts were a good idea just very flawed in execution.
        Yeah, I kinda wish they returned to 2D in a similar vein to octopath, but that's never gonna happen at this rate.

Although I do think we still have a chance to see another Legends game which I want to see.
            Legends Arceus was the only game that actually justified the jump to 3D instead of being 3D just because. 

Arceus was revolutionary for a Pokemon game, but compared to the jumps other franchises have made, it's rather tame and half baked.
    To back up your point, you could also use Scarlet/Violet as a comparison, which came out more recently. It has sold over 23m copies and was Nintendo's biggest launch ever (10m sales in 3 days).
    Fair point and good resourceful info. Thank you for your reply.
I remember seeing alpha gameplay on Twitter like a millennia ago and I assumed it would never actually come out.
definitely feels like they really only marketed it starting like a week before early access release
It's cool, I hadn't heard about it until like 3 days ago either. I've also never played a survival or Pokemon game, so I guess it makes sense. I did end up buying it though cuz a bunch of people in my clan and Steam friends list bought it. I played for about 3 hours last night before I had to go to sleep and I was really enjoying it. Looking forward to starting to play it again today very soon.
A lot of YouTubers have been playing it lately too. 

I‚Äôm always skeptical when YouTubers who are known to do paid reviews or plays start pushing a game.
I‚Äôve played by myself because my friends would rather watch than join in (even though it‚Äôs only $20ish!). Still pretty fun, though I imagine it takes a lot more time to accomplish things.
    [deleted]
        You‚Äôre right! Gonna have to let em know.
            The gamepass version is not compatible with steam version right now. It‚Äôs 3 months outdated.
        You pay for gamepass, it's not free on gamepass.

Free on gamepass would be if it were a free trial of gamepass, which they are much stricter about now.
Since you can adjust most settings, you can make solo not so painful and keep the fun you'd have in coop, just without the other players
ive never actually played palword but its very obviously got ark influence. U catch creature make creature stronger make little base, in ark u catch dinosaur make dinoasaure stronger make little base
Yeah no one cares
    I do because I want the game to commit to the automation parts better earlier on in base development. Like let me set shit like spheres to just produce an infinite amount at workbenches so that they‚Äôll be made whenever the resources are available.
        This! And a filter for chests... God I hate when my Pals put a pile of wood and stone in EVERY chest in my base...
    I do because that's completely misrepresenting what the game actually is...
Making the Pals work is something that should be more common in the Pok√©mon games, we already know that's how that world works, but they don't ever really lean into it.
    We always play as a child in the pokemon games.
        But we rarely see mons working in the world,not just for the protagonist. Every so often we might see Machamp being used for construction, but given what the creatures can do, the Pok√©mon world should look like the Flintstone world, where the creature's abilities are used in everyday life.
    Yeah, iirc there has onely been one gen where you can make your boxed pokemon "work" is in gen 7 with the poke pelago. Strangely enough it never returned, like many other things in pokemon.
Yeah but in this case palworld had very little to  almost no marketing the whole time. It only got popular because it's a solid game and people on twitch and other socials showed off the game and its a fairly cheap price point.
Hmmm I don‚Äôt think so , it was announced in 2021 but it literally just became public early access like 2 days ago
two different groups
    Well I‚Äôm in both. Not anymore though. I can‚Äôt be f‚Äôed to play the second half of SV DLC. It not fun. I won‚Äôt be buying the next game if it‚Äôs as crappy. Guess I‚Äôll only be I. The complaining group then.
it's pretty fun! I've played the cracked version for a bit, but I'll wait for the full released. I can't with early access games anymore.
femboys gonna femboy
Eh, I get what they‚Äôre driving at. SM64 is kind of the archetype for this. That game is pretty mechanically barebones compared to the average modern AAA game or even a newer 3D Mario game, and there‚Äôs not a ton going on plot-wise. What is there is so polished and well-made that it set the standard for high-quality 3D platforming, and still holds up pretty well almost 30 years later.
Did Nintendo write that? Lol
Is it not? I'm not a Nintendo fan, but they do seem to prioritize tight controls in all their games. Odyssey's Mario feels silky smooth to control, but the story is just... Is it even there?

Botw as well. Everyone loved the physics and the exploration but you'd be hard-pressed someone who liked the main story lol
Nintendos first party titles are the definition of refined gameplay. Nintendo has literally held on the ballsacks of gamers since the NES. Anyone much like yourself who think otherwise forget the fact that Pokemon isn‚Äôt developed in house and GameFreak is not in fact a Nintendo developer. They are 3rd party. 

Name me any in house first party Nintendo Franchise that isn‚Äôt highly acclaimed and loved across the board?
    Sure buddy, sure.
        Keep being butthurt buddy. Keep being butthurt üòÇ
Gamefreak? No. Nintendo? Yes.
I think Nintendo treats their fans like shit, but their games do usually have good gameplay.
Dude the Gap between 1st and 2nd it's huge wft
    Gotta catch em all (all the $$$, that is)
Level 26 here with a pokemon on my head with a gun lol
fair most of my friends and discord groups i am in were raving about it for years so i assumed it was mostly known :)
    Aha yeah I had never heard of it until it released, but I've been having a good time with it
        My friends and I played Craftopia before PalWorld was announced and that was a shit ton of ridiculous fun (I fully recommend it, don't listen to those that say it's been EA for 3+ years as being a bad thing). Then we saw PalWorld and we were hyped about that game ever since!
You played it? It's already sold millions of times on day one and many people never watch twitch from these buyers.
What do you mean it dosent have content? I've been playing it a lot with plenty more to do without much of a grind too, unless you are some god gamer and a luck lod beating every boss with the basic bow and catching each with the first ball i doubt many people have finished the current content yet
Why dont you elaborate?
    The company I guess also launched a game called craftopia that‚Äôs been in EA for 3 years and slightly abandoned. The art for the pals is generative a.i. look it up yo lol. Like the games fun. But I have a feeling after a few days the honey moon phase and immense copy paste and lack of depth and content will take its toll and people will be quite bored by the end of the week once they start to peel back the curtain and realize how shallow the content is.
        Do you even look into anything you're saying? Craftopia is still very much supported. Was updated last month even. Also a separate dev team than Palworld. The AI I don't know much about but not sure why that would be an issue if true.  These games aren't meant to be played forever. You soak up all the content and move on to something else. Check back in in six months or a year and do another play thru with new content. Rinse and repeat
            I will likely never understand people expecting infinite replayability from every game, most games are good to complete once and be done or maybe pick up much later to give it another run through.
I got my money's worth of entertainment already and I haven't even left the starting zone yet. If they don't abandon it, that's just going to keep adding value to my 26 dollar purchase. To me, joy is worth more than a "perfect" game.
    I know that. This is why most game developers have stopped trying to make good games. 3.5 years ago they released a survival game with the "pokeball" mechanics in early access. That game is still on EA, and yet they released palworld, another survival game with "pokeballs" on EA.
Trust me, I'm HATING survival games (Minecraft, ark and all of them!!!), don't wanted to try palworld, for my brother I'm played it with him ... 9 hours straight without a pause now ...

Early you need to build up some things, eat some Berry's and farm wood or stone but after you settled down an easy base and catched some pals, they do all the work complete alone, we leveld, build and crafted for like 3 hours and after that, we was just exploring for 6 hours straight without any survival aspect (even eating is automatic after you have the item for it).
We already Slain 12 bosses and catched like 80 different pals, it's amazing.

It's more natural and intuitive and easy to understand, I would say the survival part feels like a game feature and not work.
Survival usually means game aspects like hunger and temperature are something you have to manage while doing other parts of the game but it is often paired with the base building tag as they tend to fit well together with making large bases to automate or at least efficiently manage those survival needs
I am neither of those, so why do I enjoy it? The same with a bunch of my friends
True. As long as it won't affect other developers. You can play whatever you want, its your money.
    who cares if it does affect other developers, they will start making fun games too?
        No. They will stop actually making clever designs and settle for 5 minute craft videogames and hope it reaches the same level of funny meme. 

Not every genre of videogames can be made with free UE5 assets and AI generating enemies.
            Developers already do that on their own or are you one of those COD players
                And how exactly does further enabling to do shitty games help that case?
On PC it plays like a really cheep console port.  You can't rotate angled wall tiles for roofing, and the interface is complete ass. I made it about an hour before I had better things to do.  Thank goodness I played on Gamepass and didn't pay 40 bucks for it.
    Can't say I've done much with angled walls but I've found the interface simple enough and easy to use even with a lacking tutorial I've been able to figure it all out and I've only played around 10 hours so far with plenty more to explore
Bet he hasn't even played it
Better to be around smart peole than sick pokemon fans. 

Minority > Majority

You are like mosquitos and ants, you are always together and can just bite and cry.

Are you ashamed being POKEMON fan? You like cute little doggos and dragons in small little cute red ball? Oh, wow <3 Puki moooooooon
    Plenty of people who play this aren't Pok√©mon fans, what are you on?
    Ah..to be 12 again. Fun times. You'll grow up, buddy. It's okay.

You downvote even proofs now? Holy shish you flat earth bois are insane
    whats wrong with them making similar creatures in their game?
    Nintendog fan boys are here.

    Your problem is you're conflating an aesthetic with quality level. Realism != Good.

The reason this game has the aesthetic it does is because it's inspired by a franchise heavily entwined with anime and made by Japanese devs that are probably fans of anime themselves.

The fact you think that visual style is the biggest indicator of the quality of a game is evidence that, ironically, it's you who is simple minded and easily appeased, having a childish mindset. Shiny thing is not always better (and this game is actually shiny, just in a different font than you deem acceptable, apparently).
But roblox is ass on all fronts. That was my point. Also, hey kids, its ok that you played shitty games. Nobody will look down on you for that
    Sadly, AAA games these days are usually creatively stunted and plagued with monetization. Thing is, this is all the younger generations know. 

*Most* of them didn‚Äôt grow up playing Deus Ex, Diablo 1-2, or Half Life 1-2. It‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre missing if you never experienced it. 

The gaming industry is far, FAR more corporate than it was say even 15 years ago. Now more money is spent on marketing than crafting a storyline or making sure the gameplay is fun.
You dumb? OP asked.
    you dumb? He asked for something else
        Fuck off
One of their previous games was based on the concept of AI art. It was a shitty game and mostly negative on Steam.
    actually its mostly positive on steam, do your research first
        I think you should do yours: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154230/AI\_Art\_Impostor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154230/AI_Art_Impostor/?curator_clanid=41648656)

If you read my comment thoroughly you could see I was not talking about Palworld.
            I thought you are talking about craftopia. Well its good then that palworld has nothing to do with this AI game
I‚Äôm a current ark player and the amount of ex tribe mates that are begging me to come play is ridiculous
    lmao same. this game in my opinion has a chance to be almost as big or bigger than ark
        It already dwarfs Ark like the sun dwarfs the Earth
And Palworld is only a fraction of the GBs Ark takes.
    I was wondering about that. Why does Ark take so much disk space, makes no sense
        Just terrible optimization
        Lots of it is the maps, you can reduce the space by only installing some of them.  The game has like 10 different world maps that are pretty detailed and a lot of extra data tied to them plus unique textures.
    69 likes
All of that is completely customizable in Ark. How could you not be aware of that?
yes, up to 32 players
    I would say there is co-op up to 4 people and then there are servers with 32 players. I have not tried pal world solo with friends but I'm playing on a dedicated server with friends
except those games never even came close to Dota 2, dota 2s all time peak is 1,295,114 and Palworlds is 1,291,967. Palworld only came out 3 days ago and I hadn't ever heard of it before yesterday, How tf is all this possible? especially since when looking at gameplay and trailers it doesn't look like anything special, on top of that is $40???  its literally the most-played paid game of all time how does this make sense.

edit: the above number is the peak player count on steam alone
    And it launched on game pass, and those numbers don‚Äôt even include game pass, that‚Äôs the really insane detail that no one is mentioning.
    Damn I knew it was a big deal but not THAT big of a deal, this is insane lmao

can anyone who has played it let us know if the game is actually good? XD
    PUBG hit 3mil+ when it was paid back in 2018, so idk about that?
        Damn, I forgot abt that i thought it was always free for some reason, no one seems to be mentioning it. Ive seen game news sites say Palworld's the most played paid game of all time,

  Regardless tho 2nd place is still insane. Pubg was literally impossible to miss back then, same with games like among us i mean literally every single creator I watched was playing these games, but I haven't seen almost anyone posting vids about Palword even now a couple of days after ea release. I just don't get how the game's so dang popular
    >and I hadn't ever heard of it before yesterday, How tf is this all possible?

You just dont spend any time on Twitter, Twitch or Youtube.  Period.  That wasnt really that difficult to deduce.  If you're not on the internet, you're not going to hear about things.  Pretty simple concept I would say.
It's far more like ark in gameplay than Pokemon, but ANY creature collection game gets compared to Pokemon.

        Palworld is not in an active lawsuit with Nintendo.
            My bad, Nintendo is in the process of finalizing their lawsuit because palworld is in clear copyright violation ü§¶ use commonsense
                What exactly are they in violation of? I highly doubt Palworld would've even hit market if they had grounds for litigation given it was anmounced im 2021. The person who was selling mods using their IP already got a cease and desist.

Also copyright infringement isn't a common sense thing. Or maybe it is to you. Are you a patent lawyer?  

Even if they did sue it doesn't mean they would win either. The proof would have to be incontrovertible and I've yet to see anything unless you know something nobody else does.
                    Not to mention the headlines for palworld is "Pok√©mon with guns", like hello??? Doesn't take a rocket scientist ü§¶
                        Those are journalists who write those headlines not the developers...
                        Absolutely nowhere on the game does it say that, dude you ate so full of shit. Every sentence you have made on this post is pure lies. Just because you read some person on the internet saying it's pokemon with guns doesn't mean it's official palworld news. You are either 12 or just an idiot
                    [Forbes ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/01/24/the-pokemon-company-announces-it-will-investigate-palworld-ip-and-assets/)

[bbc](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-68092330)

[Marketing-Interactive](https://www.marketing-interactive.com/pokemon-copyright-investigation-palworld)

[CharlieIntel](https://www.charlieintel.com/pokemon/the-pokemon-company-confirm-theyre-investigating-palworld-copyright-allegations-299891/)

‚ÄúWe have not granted any permission for the use of Pok√©mon intellectual property or assets in that game,‚Äù the company said in a statement.

‚ÄúWe intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pok√©mon,‚Äù it added.


Do I need to say more?
                        You clearly aren't reading any of the links you posted lmao. These are all quotes from the above articles. 

"The Pok√©mon Company also said that the investigations are in response to having received many inquiries regarding an unnamed game by another company released in January"

"While it is significant that The Pok√©mon Company issued a statement about this situation, the way it reads does not really imply anything much would probably happen here. Nintendo has says they haven‚Äôt licensed any IP or assets to Palworld which I mean, of course they didn‚Äôt."

"As for IP, clearly no actual terms or exact characters from Pok√©mon are being used. Nintendo immediately got a Pok√©mon reskin mod for Palworld taken down when it went live, and I cannot see them having much of a case comparing two electric mice and proving that the concept infringes on Pikachu. You can‚Äôt copyright the concept of an electric mouse."

"Palworld was also in development for many years before this so this is not exactly news to The Pok√©mon Company and Nintendo that this game and its Pok√©mon-adjacent monsters exist. This reads like a statement that they should probably say something given how big this game has gotten, though I would be amazed if this ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù turned up anything that could cause real harm to Palworld, which at the time of this writing, has just passed eight million copies sold in six days."
                    It's just commonsense buddy, a game that has nothing to do with Nintendo comes out with a game that has "Pok√©mon" that are basically ripping off Pok√©mon; sorry you can't piece that together?
                        I only responded to you because you said they were in the middle of an active lawsuit which is verifiably untrue. Idk why youre being a dick about it. 

"Basically" doesn't sound iron clad to me personally. If it was so open and shut then sales would likely *already* be blocked and it would be incredibly easy to point out where exactly the infringement is. Palworld isn't the first game to use the catching monsters concept and Pok√©mon wasn't the first. Do you have actual examples? Have you played the game? 

The person who did side by sides on blender of 3D models that went viral already recanted their statements and admitted to exaggerating the similarities. 

Could Nintendo sue? Sure. Anyone can sue anyone for anything. Do they have grounds? It doesn't seem like it, but I suppose we will see. I just highly doubt Nintendo would've let Palworld sell 6 million copies if it's as cut and dry as you are implying.
        No its not you just completely made that shit up.
That's because most people are like OP, they only know it from a few images.
I mean they did something good with Arceus so if they could expand on that by about ten fold then we could have a really decent game.
    Arceus is like the beta test to what Palworld is.
        Arceus is like bedof and palworld is like arceus
Oh they know, but since the stuff they keep pushing out sells just fine, they don't care
    It‚Äôs crazy that capitalism or whatever you want to call it, evolved Pokemon to this point. The amount of money they are missing out on by taking risks making good products over safe bets‚Ä¶.who knows
        Pokemon Violet in all it's shoddy, bland glory sold 23.2 MILLION copies. Nintendo isn't missing out on anything.
Pokemon fans have been hoping that for years upon years now. Everytime a new monster collecting game gets popular, nothing changes.
    Because the games sell. The adults who‚Äôve been playing for years can‚Äôt let go, and parents buy for their kids. The simple nature of story is friendly for young children dipping into JRPGS, while online battling tends more to the long time players, or even shiny hunting. People complain about the system, but remember. The franchise that was only supposed to be one game, is still marking millions of sales. SwSh and SV despite being ‚Äúhated‚Äù are second and third respectively in sales behind the original games.
they're an Japanese company, like hell they'll change.
You can drop most of the survival aspects in settings.
    Survival only plays a role early. Once you have your first berry farm you have infinite food. Maybe in the future they change stuff because right now that's all you need. You don't even need water.

What is nice though is that your Pokemon get sick and you have to craft medicine. Or catch a new one too replace the slave hahaha
        Strict up survival is pretty tame that is true, however it comes with many gameplay aspects that are generally used in survival games like based building, lots of farming etc. The core Gameplay-loop is more like a survival than a Pokemon game.
    I‚Äôm having a lot more fun since doing this. Can‚Äôt be bothered with survival games where you‚Äôre constantly battling hot/cold and hunger.
        The problem for me is they always make the hunger deplete way too fast. Same with thirst if implemented. I know you can change it in settings but my first playthrough has been just normal to get the hang of things.

Catching pals is pretty damn easy. Caught lvl 15 dinos and a lvl 15 deer at lvl 7. Also caught a lvl 11 giant bird. All at lvl 7. 

The punk looking Dino kid is a pretty good companion for catching other pals. 

It would be really cool to be able to have all 5 pals out following you.
    Is it still fun as a single player game?
        I've only played alone so far and I'm having fun. hoping my friends decide to get it at some point to try co-op
        Haven't touched multiplayer yet and probably never will except for when my wife finally has time and the mental energy to play but solo has been an absolute blast.
        I hear one of the main reasons single player works so well with this game is thanks to the pals, since you will neither feel alone nor will have to do all the work of resource gathering by yourself since you have, well, you know, your pals.
        It‚Äôs server to server, so solo is for your intense grind and base building and then multiplayer is just to chill on
            No?

You just have 1 friend host an open server so you and your friends can drop in and out at any time 24/7.

 That's where the real fun of these games lie.
    Explain

No way I got down voted because I wanted to know something lol
        when you first start you make a decision on "world settings" before you actually start playing. here you can choose preset casual-hard or custom. you can have multiple worlds saved with unique settings. you can customize all settings in each preset as well. the settings you can change are on a sliding scale and go from 0/0.1/0.5 to 3/5/10/5000 depending on the setting.

heres what you can modify:

Day time speed

night time speed

EXP rate

Pal Capture Rate

Pal Apperance Rate

Damage from Pals multiplier

        Money can be *exchanged* for goods and services!
            God damn it you beat me too it.
        You can adjust difficulty and the various difficulty gives or takes away things that add to the game. Or you can set a custom difficulty like enemy HP or ATK exp and things of that nature. I can‚Äôt remember the full list of settings but you can change it to how you want to play.
The game is extremely customizable. You can tune almost every setting to the point you can drastically limit survival elements to be trivial.
Try it, it's everything people wanted arceus to be. Survival is there but after the beginning it takes less relevance.
    Yeah it honestly isnt really survival. You kill one pal every now and again if you're hungry, normal difficulty hunger drain is basically negligible
        You don't even need to kill Pals for food once you get the Pal that produces berries for you. In our private server, between the 5 of us, we all have at least 100 cooked berries on each of us and at least 150 in our food basket and another 200+ in the fridge
        an hour in you get a feed bag also that auto fees.
        You realize you can have chickens hatch eggs for you right?
    I did on gamepass, I found the tutorial borderline useless as it didn't explain how to do things just what to do. Even eating food took pressing every button trying to figure out which worked. Everything felt and looked unfinished. Hearing the survival aspect drops off it nice to hear tho

Maybe in a few patches, but I'm aware the gamepass version is wya before the steam. Version
        The game has a section in the options called survival guide. It explains most of the things.
        To each their own, but I‚Äôm genuinely sick of long winded tutorials that I‚Äôm forced to complete. This game has a short quick one that in theory you don‚Äôt even have to do. I rate that highly. Let me work stuff out for myself, sick of being told how to do absolutely EVRRYTHING in every game I play. Let me learn it myself if I want to. (I understand some want full tutorials, but more games need to make it optional)
Digimon Cyber Sleuth is what you‚Äôre looking for.
    Such a great game. Was not expecting how dark some of the cases got.

Edit: Think I still need to actually beat it and start the 2nd game.
        I was not expecting Hacker's Memory to be as good as it was, but it's a really interesting story and it's fun how it intersects with the main story of Cybersleuth.
    This is something that has interested me, need to check how it runs on deck
The settings basically allow you to remove the survival aspect
I just change the world settings to not deal with the survival aspects since I also hate survival games. 

Honestly this game would be so much better if it didn't lean so far into the survival part.
    >Honestly this game would be so much better if it didn't mean so far into the survival part.

After a few hours, your Pals start automating everything for you. All we do now is explore, do dungeons, capture more Pals, and fight bosses
        How do I get them to stop ADD'ing out? They do a 1/10th of a task and then go do something else
            lift them and throw them at the task you want them to do, you can see the task assigning to them when you hold the throw button
            I've found that you need to get the Pals that can *only* do one or two things. If they can do everything, they'll try to do everything. Also, if you pick them up and throw them onto a task, it will assign them to it
            Make sure to have clear pathways between tasks, chests and other spots they go to. There are very annoying hitboxes on few stuff you build that will block pathing and fuck with AI, also they care a lot about the way stuff is facing so don't build stations facing wall on 4th floor. 

On my 2nd playthrough(wanted to restart to try stuff out) I went straight away to big flat zone and built a lot of wooden floor before even placing my tablet.
I wonder if the survival stuff can be modded out or turned off in the menus. I avoid survival crafting bs like it's a disease. But I love the idea of open world exploration with Pok√©mon like companion and guns... although I don't really want to shoot them.
    Killing Pals is the best part! Or putting them to work on your compound. 

You can host a server and change the hunger options and edit the game rules.
This was me, downloaded and jumped in, within 15 minutes I got over-encumbered and thought, nah, I ain't doing this again.  I loved the idea of Pokemon with guns.  Can't be bothered with another survival game where you have to play for hours before you can do fun stuff
That's always been there? You catch a wild animal and force it to fight for you until it passes out from pain. How's that any different here?
    In Pokemon it was presented more as a "partnership" after the initial taming; in Palworld there is no ambiguity.
        Partnership... Except for the hundreds of Pokemon you have sitting in stasis. 

Gotta catch em all, to sit in a void for all eternity? 

Dark as fuck.
        Except for those two games that basically called it slavery...
        It's not slavery because they like it  
They smile therefore it's not Stockholm syndrome

Pok√©mon games are weird man  
Even if they try to make it ambiguous and friendly, the whole concept has always been weird when you look at it 

Oh well, I'm having fun with palworld now
Pok√©mon MASTER
People say that but they kinda immediately throw out that theme and it turns out the whole "free Pok√©mon" movement was just a conspiracy set up by the team rocket of that game and Pok√©mon actually like being subjugated or something.
wait until all of your pals have developed eating disorders and refuse to work, so you ceremoniously butcher one of them to send a message to the others
    If by ceremonically you mean merging all the shit pals into one pal, and then butchering that pal in front of them while they're eating breakfast
    Isn't that what employers basically do when staff are under performing in the real world? Threaten them with the sack which leads to no money which leads to starvation?
People ruin their underwear over GTA6 but apparently this game has slavery in it even though all my guys got endless food and a jacuzzi to chill in
I mean, you can literally capture humans and sell them so...

Edit: idk who down voted me, but I'm dead serious. Any NPC in game minus the tower bosses are capturable
    Well. Technically they are not humans and they are not on planet earth, it's just fantasy. they are just pixels and you can do this sort of stuff in loads of games. It isn't like the game forces you to do that you do it you are making them slaves out of your own will. Much worse goes on in games like rust and ark.¬†
        I don't recall anyone saying you're forced to capture the NPCs? Just that you can, and given that they are shaped like a human, act like a human, and speak like a human, its relatively easy to compare it to slavery as a joke. Especially since the humans sell so damn well üòÇ 500 or so gold per. 

But really, you're taking a joke about the games mechanics a little personally. If you don't wanna capture the syndicate dudes and just wanna kill them, go for it. Play how you want to
Bro, you are approaching the point. You are a wage slave. Read Anarchist literature and watch Zeitgeist Addendum & Zeitgeist Moving Forward. Trust me.
I'd say more than 50% luck these days, especially when you're a solo dev with no spare money for advertising. Posts on reddit might get a few players but likely not enough to boost you into visibility, and twitter no chance unless you already had a following, which is unlikely for most people.
    You think getting one of the highest played games is luck? I dunno man. I would say the game needs to be pretty damn good.
        No, I think regardless of effort if you're unlucky your game will go nowhere. You can have the greatest idea and solid execution, and it doesn't matter if nobody finds your game.  

The lethal companies of game releases are one in tens of thousands, if not more.
            Maybe. Do you have any examples of really solid games that never got any traction?
                Off the top of my head, no. That said, once the next steam next fest rolls around you could look at the steamdb charts for the majority of games that get featured there and you'll find that they either gained only a small temporary influx in sales, or none at all. That isn't to say that every game there is a gem to everyone because that's too subjective, but that many games that could be gems just never get the opportunity/exposure to get to that point.  

So yeah, I'm not saying these people put in no effort and don't deserve their game taking off, just that effort is not a guarantee and without the resources to make large advertising pushes (and even then) there is a significant chance that the game flies completely under the radar.
                    So you have a theory, but no evidence.

I don't completely disagree with you though. I do think some luck is involved as well, but imo the luck really comes down to finding a formula with broad appeal. There probably are solid games with low sales, but they probably don't have broad appeal.

In general though, I think that to even have a chance at being a highly played game, it's gotta be a damn good game.
                        Steps To Getting Downvoted On Reddit

1. Locate a comment that is one (or more) of the following: an overgeneralization, an opinion presented as fact, or an unsupported conclusion

2. Request *any* form of evidence: data, examples, screenshots, tweets, literally anything

3. Once it is clear that no evidence can/will be provided, note that there does not seem to be evidence to support the initial claim.

4. lmaoooo get fucked asshole LOL substantiated claims are BORING and for fuckin' NERDS get out of here with your reasonable discourse

5. DAE feel like 2+2 actually = 5???
                I can give you 3 - which of course are my subjective opinions (otherwise the games would be popular obviously lol)

Shadowrun (2007) Xbox/PC - one of the very first cross-platform FPS games, has a 'buy system' similar to CS:GO, and abilities like that of Overwatch or Valorant (teleport dash through wall/floor, place a tree of healing) 

\[personally, teleporting through walls in an FPS game in 2007 was so cool and revolutionary to me\]

- maybe it was just too ahead of its time, but apparently I just read that the servers are still live and running

Battleborn (2016) PS/Xbox/PC - I believe this to be the best example in terms of luck. They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms. It was a 5v5 team based game sort of like LoL in the sense of PvPvE where you can capture points to get AI to fight alongside you (I think that's how LoL works, at least) - but it was First Person, and the first time anything like this released on console.

- unfortunately for them, they released their game within 21 days of one of the most popular games of all time, Overwatch, so lots of direct comparisons were made between the 2 FPS games.. and only one survived in the end

Blazing Sails (2021) \[2023 official release\] PC - you show this game to a Sea of Thieves diehard and after 4 seconds they will call it a knockoff and dismiss it, which is what happened at the game's launch. I played SoT only a couple times, and while I admired the graphics and mechanics - I quickly lost interest after discovering that majority of the gameplay is PvE oriented, extremely repetitive, and lacks hardly any variables in the game (only 3 different guns, 1 melee weapon... this still stands true 6 years later)

(I am biased, I am not going to try to pretend otherwise lol) 

- this is why I was excited to come across Blazing Sails.. it is everything I wish SoT was. It removes the PvE aspect out of the game, leaving only fast paced PvP left. And most notably, the game is objectively 100x better in the area that has been SoT's #1 most well known issue for 6 years running now: Hit Registration. The game also launched with I believe around 12+ weapons, so it already had more depth in terms of variables (currently 21+ weapons) 

The hit reg in this game is one of the best I've seen in a game, which surprised me for an indie cartoon pirate game. I used to be active in the game's discord when it first came out and told the devs how good the hit reg was, especially in comparison to SoT.. and that it should be one of the main selling points

I believe it to be a combination of bad luck in terms of not gaining any traction, not having any big streamers play, as well possibly bad marketing in distinguishing themselves from SoT from the start. It is one of the few games I've seen on Steam that has a 90% rating, and nearly every negative review is about there being a lack of players, not the actual game itself.

Blazing Sails just released their official trailer a couple months ago, and the last line of it is "...so feast your eyes on an Indie game, so eye-watering, you'll mistake the work of one family of 4 in Belgium, for that of hundreds in a multi-national, AAA studio - then gasp in utter disbelief at which one actually delivers accurate hit reg"
                    > They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms.

Just wanted to say you reminded me of Monday Night Combat. A TPS-MOBA. I freaking loved that game!
                        dude.. what!?- how have I never seen that game?

I just watched some videos, and that looks way ahead of its time.. idk how I haven't seen that before :o
                    Yeah, there's definitely games that are overhyped and there's definitely games that are underhyped, and luck definitely IS a part of it...

The problem is that the entire conversation is sort of hamstrung by the fact that "Luck" is such a nebulous concept. Like, we all more or less know what we mean by "luck", except there's a lot of real-world complexity that the word "luck" hand-waves away--albeit unintentionally.

To use a recent example, is it luck that Lies of P was such an unexpected smash hit yet Lords of the Fallen had an ambivalent, mostly lukewarm reception? 

Sort of? But what do i/we mean by "luck" in this instance, right? We're not just saying "oh yeah, it's a total dice roll"... Realistically, the "luck" came from the fact that Lies of P was a unique blend of ideas (Fairy Tale x Souls), part of it came from the fact that it was--in many people's estimation--the first game to go toe-to-toe with FromSoft's combat design. 

And so there's a luck factor to that: Because Lies of P came out a couple weeks prior to LotF, people perhaps evaluated LotF more critically than they would have if Lies of P hadn't come out at all. 

But IS that luck? Hard to say, because there were a million-billion decisions made along the way that led to the outcome that we now might refer to as "lucky" or "unlucky"

Idk, not really agreeing or disagreeing, just find it an interesting topic.
            The mentality that everything comes down to luck is cope. Success is earned.
No, I get it. Im just surprised that the game is THIS popular while a small proportion of reddit users know what it is. Also, it's paid so that drastically increases the entry floor, unlike dota 2, and CS2 which used to dominate the chart until this game came out
    Im guessing streamers because this game seems to be the perfect type of game to stream. its cute and has a lot to play around with.
    I've seen three posts about it in the last 24 hours. There's your marketing. Wouldn't be surprised if some percentage of these posts are from the marketing team themselves.
Still exists in Africa today
Also you can capture actual people in palworld
    what? lol

players or NPCs?
        NPCs. There's no pvp
            what do NPCs do? are there fixed settlements or are they just other survivors or how does that work?  I find the steam page description rather lacking
                You can make them a camp slave or make them fight for you like a Pok√©mon. Or you can sell them for a good price to the black market trader.
lol what?
    Yes that‚Äôs right
I'll probably play it.  But I definitely bought it because they went out of their way to make it happen, so I feel like they should reap the rewards.
It's no joke though, it's actually pretty decent. I mostly enjoy the potion mixing game.
>but i'd never ever download those pieces of junk on my phone.

Then maybe you miss the joke, which is that the game never actually is the one in the ad.  So you download something totally different that isn't what you wanted to play.  This steam game is actually all the games in the ads that are fake games to get you to download.
It gives me cube world vibes which i deeply miss.. it looks adorable
    When my penguins haul my wood around they balance it on their head and just kind of bounce around my camp with it. It's adorable and my wife and I are having a blast
    It is adorable. You can actually interact with your Pals and their reactions are so damn cute! It makes you feel even worse for making them work in the quarries or slaughtering the rest of their species :c
Even average games run above 20 FPS and don't rip out features with each iteration.
    Yeah same deal with the FiFAs and CODs, can just push out any garbage when you have a mindless horde buying everything¬†
        Because despite what a lot of people might want to believe, 80% of the Pokemon playerbase are under the age of 14 and have barely any reference to how good the game should be, let alone whether the game is actually any good or not.

When you're a kid any game can be good...
            Not true, the younger generation is almost, if not more, obsessed with retro games now than ever before with help from youtube. It's one of the reasons the old pokemon games won't drop in value, despite having a bazillion copies each, because the newer generations want to re buy gameboys/ds and play those games they missed out on that us adults keep saying were the best.

And God forbid Nintendo re releases them on Switch and make themselves an insurmountable fortune with the profits they'd make.
    [deleted]
        Yep, I didn't even buy S/V because it's just such unexcusable dogshit. They then admitted it, after the outrage, and instead of fixing the game, released dlc....bruh. They have zero reason to make the game better so I'll just be sad and not buy their games anymore. I know it doesn't make a difference but there are SO many games that come out that are more worth my time and money
            [deleted]
                When the spin offs on gamecube have better animations and frame rate then games on the switch, you'd think they'd actually start caring about the quality control. 

It's just such a sad fall from grace seeing every game get worse and worse. Hopefully Nintendo starts spreading the license around more. Until then I'll keep enjoying actual good games like bg3 lol
    I almost think they made exp share mandatory out of spite.¬†
Average is a huge compliment to those games
As someone who work in IT. It is hillarious to witness people asking nintendo to make effort. When they created the franchise. The franchise never was to be a story arc extension from extension. It's more like an entry rpg for children and every iteration is addressed to new children, no to 50 yo manchild who played them all.  
You can't even have a grasp on the very existence of the ip but anyway...  


So these Nintendo evil guys are the one puting 0 effort in their game. But on the other hand. Palworld, ripping everything from mechanics, to UI to artistic direction are the one putting in the effort. I guess the climax of these effort were made when they were feeding the pokemon games to their IA.   


Fucking tool. And I'm not a pokemon fan. Fuck pokemon, you're supposed to play one of their game and that's it. Fuck "gamers". Fuck "video game" industry. And all of you enjoying palworlds should commit suicide. You are enjoying the worst turd ever created since NFT games.
    Buying two copies of Palworlds now due to this post. Thanks for the suggestion.
Plus you can capture humans in Palworld. Can‚Äôt do that in Pok√©mon
Gamefreak really struggled with the transition to 3D and to the Switch. Their other Switch games (unrelated to Pokemon) also run poorly in many cases. Somewhere there‚Äôs an alternate universe where they stuck with high-quality 2D (like Octopath), but that still doesn‚Äôt address the other game design issues.

I do think some of SV‚Äôs sales were boosted by the SwSh DLC and Arceus. Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra both brought in interesting features that fans enjoyed and it seemed like they were listening to players. Arceus was also an interesting refresh of the formula (didn‚Äôt land for everyone, but it was something that added a lot of neat features like catching pokemon outside of combat).¬†

So I certainly expected that SV would continue that trend. Sadly, it did not, especially since some of the concepts were a good idea just very flawed in execution.
    Yeah, I kinda wish they returned to 2D in a similar vein to octopath, but that's never gonna happen at this rate.

Although I do think we still have a chance to see another Legends game which I want to see.
        Legends Arceus was the only game that actually justified the jump to 3D instead of being 3D just because. 

Arceus was revolutionary for a Pokemon game, but compared to the jumps other franchises have made, it's rather tame and half baked.
To back up your point, you could also use Scarlet/Violet as a comparison, which came out more recently. It has sold over 23m copies and was Nintendo's biggest launch ever (10m sales in 3 days).
Fair point and good resourceful info. Thank you for your reply.
[deleted]
    You‚Äôre right! Gonna have to let em know.
        The gamepass version is not compatible with steam version right now. It‚Äôs 3 months outdated.
    You pay for gamepass, it's not free on gamepass.

Free on gamepass would be if it were a free trial of gamepass, which they are much stricter about now.
I do because I want the game to commit to the automation parts better earlier on in base development. Like let me set shit like spheres to just produce an infinite amount at workbenches so that they‚Äôll be made whenever the resources are available.
    This! And a filter for chests... God I hate when my Pals put a pile of wood and stone in EVERY chest in my base...
I do because that's completely misrepresenting what the game actually is...
We always play as a child in the pokemon games.
    But we rarely see mons working in the world,not just for the protagonist. Every so often we might see Machamp being used for construction, but given what the creatures can do, the Pok√©mon world should look like the Flintstone world, where the creature's abilities are used in everyday life.
Yeah, iirc there has onely been one gen where you can make your boxed pokemon "work" is in gen 7 with the poke pelago. Strangely enough it never returned, like many other things in pokemon.
Well I‚Äôm in both. Not anymore though. I can‚Äôt be f‚Äôed to play the second half of SV DLC. It not fun. I won‚Äôt be buying the next game if it‚Äôs as crappy. Guess I‚Äôll only be I. The complaining group then.
Sure buddy, sure.
    Keep being butthurt buddy. Keep being butthurt üòÇ
Gotta catch em all (all the $$$, that is)
Aha yeah I had never heard of it until it released, but I've been having a good time with it
    My friends and I played Craftopia before PalWorld was announced and that was a shit ton of ridiculous fun (I fully recommend it, don't listen to those that say it's been EA for 3+ years as being a bad thing). Then we saw PalWorld and we were hyped about that game ever since!
The company I guess also launched a game called craftopia that‚Äôs been in EA for 3 years and slightly abandoned. The art for the pals is generative a.i. look it up yo lol. Like the games fun. But I have a feeling after a few days the honey moon phase and immense copy paste and lack of depth and content will take its toll and people will be quite bored by the end of the week once they start to peel back the curtain and realize how shallow the content is.
    Do you even look into anything you're saying? Craftopia is still very much supported. Was updated last month even. Also a separate dev team than Palworld. The AI I don't know much about but not sure why that would be an issue if true.  These games aren't meant to be played forever. You soak up all the content and move on to something else. Check back in in six months or a year and do another play thru with new content. Rinse and repeat
        I will likely never understand people expecting infinite replayability from every game, most games are good to complete once and be done or maybe pick up much later to give it another run through.
I know that. This is why most game developers have stopped trying to make good games. 3.5 years ago they released a survival game with the "pokeball" mechanics in early access. That game is still on EA, and yet they released palworld, another survival game with "pokeballs" on EA.
who cares if it does affect other developers, they will start making fun games too?
    No. They will stop actually making clever designs and settle for 5 minute craft videogames and hope it reaches the same level of funny meme. 

Not every genre of videogames can be made with free UE5 assets and AI generating enemies.
        Developers already do that on their own or are you one of those COD players
            And how exactly does further enabling to do shitty games help that case?
Can't say I've done much with angled walls but I've found the interface simple enough and easy to use even with a lacking tutorial I've been able to figure it all out and I've only played around 10 hours so far with plenty more to explore
Plenty of people who play this aren't Pok√©mon fans, what are you on?
Ah..to be 12 again. Fun times. You'll grow up, buddy. It's okay.
whats wrong with them making similar creatures in their game?
Nintendog fan boys are here.
Your problem is you're conflating an aesthetic with quality level. Realism != Good.

The reason this game has the aesthetic it does is because it's inspired by a franchise heavily entwined with anime and made by Japanese devs that are probably fans of anime themselves.

The fact you think that visual style is the biggest indicator of the quality of a game is evidence that, ironically, it's you who is simple minded and easily appeased, having a childish mindset. Shiny thing is not always better (and this game is actually shiny, just in a different font than you deem acceptable, apparently).
Sadly, AAA games these days are usually creatively stunted and plagued with monetization. Thing is, this is all the younger generations know. 

*Most* of them didn‚Äôt grow up playing Deus Ex, Diablo 1-2, or Half Life 1-2. It‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre missing if you never experienced it. 

The gaming industry is far, FAR more corporate than it was say even 15 years ago. Now more money is spent on marketing than crafting a storyline or making sure the gameplay is fun.
you dumb? He asked for something else
    Fuck off
actually its mostly positive on steam, do your research first
    I think you should do yours: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154230/AI\_Art\_Impostor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154230/AI_Art_Impostor/?curator_clanid=41648656)

If you read my comment thoroughly you could see I was not talking about Palworld.
        I thought you are talking about craftopia. Well its good then that palworld has nothing to do with this AI game
lmao same. this game in my opinion has a chance to be almost as big or bigger than ark
    It already dwarfs Ark like the sun dwarfs the Earth
I was wondering about that. Why does Ark take so much disk space, makes no sense
    Just terrible optimization
    Lots of it is the maps, you can reduce the space by only installing some of them.  The game has like 10 different world maps that are pretty detailed and a lot of extra data tied to them plus unique textures.
69 likes
I would say there is co-op up to 4 people and then there are servers with 32 players. I have not tried pal world solo with friends but I'm playing on a dedicated server with friends
And it launched on game pass, and those numbers don‚Äôt even include game pass, that‚Äôs the really insane detail that no one is mentioning.
Damn I knew it was a big deal but not THAT big of a deal, this is insane lmao

can anyone who has played it let us know if the game is actually good? XD
PUBG hit 3mil+ when it was paid back in 2018, so idk about that?
    Damn, I forgot abt that i thought it was always free for some reason, no one seems to be mentioning it. Ive seen game news sites say Palworld's the most played paid game of all time,

  Regardless tho 2nd place is still insane. Pubg was literally impossible to miss back then, same with games like among us i mean literally every single creator I watched was playing these games, but I haven't seen almost anyone posting vids about Palword even now a couple of days after ea release. I just don't get how the game's so dang popular
>and I hadn't ever heard of it before yesterday, How tf is this all possible?

You just dont spend any time on Twitter, Twitch or Youtube.  Period.  That wasnt really that difficult to deduce.  If you're not on the internet, you're not going to hear about things.  Pretty simple concept I would say.

    Palworld is not in an active lawsuit with Nintendo.
        My bad, Nintendo is in the process of finalizing their lawsuit because palworld is in clear copyright violation ü§¶ use commonsense
            What exactly are they in violation of? I highly doubt Palworld would've even hit market if they had grounds for litigation given it was anmounced im 2021. The person who was selling mods using their IP already got a cease and desist.

Also copyright infringement isn't a common sense thing. Or maybe it is to you. Are you a patent lawyer?  

Even if they did sue it doesn't mean they would win either. The proof would have to be incontrovertible and I've yet to see anything unless you know something nobody else does.
                Not to mention the headlines for palworld is "Pok√©mon with guns", like hello??? Doesn't take a rocket scientist ü§¶
                    Those are journalists who write those headlines not the developers...
                    Absolutely nowhere on the game does it say that, dude you ate so full of shit. Every sentence you have made on this post is pure lies. Just because you read some person on the internet saying it's pokemon with guns doesn't mean it's official palworld news. You are either 12 or just an idiot

‚ÄúWe have not granted any permission for the use of Pok√©mon intellectual property or assets in that game,‚Äù the company said in a statement.

‚ÄúWe intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pok√©mon,‚Äù it added.


Do I need to say more?
                    You clearly aren't reading any of the links you posted lmao. These are all quotes from the above articles. 

"The Pok√©mon Company also said that the investigations are in response to having received many inquiries regarding an unnamed game by another company released in January"

"While it is significant that The Pok√©mon Company issued a statement about this situation, the way it reads does not really imply anything much would probably happen here. Nintendo has says they haven‚Äôt licensed any IP or assets to Palworld which I mean, of course they didn‚Äôt."

"As for IP, clearly no actual terms or exact characters from Pok√©mon are being used. Nintendo immediately got a Pok√©mon reskin mod for Palworld taken down when it went live, and I cannot see them having much of a case comparing two electric mice and proving that the concept infringes on Pikachu. You can‚Äôt copyright the concept of an electric mouse."

"Palworld was also in development for many years before this so this is not exactly news to The Pok√©mon Company and Nintendo that this game and its Pok√©mon-adjacent monsters exist. This reads like a statement that they should probably say something given how big this game has gotten, though I would be amazed if this ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù turned up anything that could cause real harm to Palworld, which at the time of this writing, has just passed eight million copies sold in six days."
                It's just commonsense buddy, a game that has nothing to do with Nintendo comes out with a game that has "Pok√©mon" that are basically ripping off Pok√©mon; sorry you can't piece that together?
                    I only responded to you because you said they were in the middle of an active lawsuit which is verifiably untrue. Idk why youre being a dick about it. 

"Basically" doesn't sound iron clad to me personally. If it was so open and shut then sales would likely *already* be blocked and it would be incredibly easy to point out where exactly the infringement is. Palworld isn't the first game to use the catching monsters concept and Pok√©mon wasn't the first. Do you have actual examples? Have you played the game? 

The person who did side by sides on blender of 3D models that went viral already recanted their statements and admitted to exaggerating the similarities. 

Could Nintendo sue? Sure. Anyone can sue anyone for anything. Do they have grounds? It doesn't seem like it, but I suppose we will see. I just highly doubt Nintendo would've let Palworld sell 6 million copies if it's as cut and dry as you are implying.
    No its not you just completely made that shit up.
Arceus is like the beta test to what Palworld is.
    Arceus is like bedof and palworld is like arceus
It‚Äôs crazy that capitalism or whatever you want to call it, evolved Pokemon to this point. The amount of money they are missing out on by taking risks making good products over safe bets‚Ä¶.who knows
    Pokemon Violet in all it's shoddy, bland glory sold 23.2 MILLION copies. Nintendo isn't missing out on anything.
Because the games sell. The adults who‚Äôve been playing for years can‚Äôt let go, and parents buy for their kids. The simple nature of story is friendly for young children dipping into JRPGS, while online battling tends more to the long time players, or even shiny hunting. People complain about the system, but remember. The franchise that was only supposed to be one game, is still marking millions of sales. SwSh and SV despite being ‚Äúhated‚Äù are second and third respectively in sales behind the original games.
Survival only plays a role early. Once you have your first berry farm you have infinite food. Maybe in the future they change stuff because right now that's all you need. You don't even need water.

What is nice though is that your Pokemon get sick and you have to craft medicine. Or catch a new one too replace the slave hahaha
    Strict up survival is pretty tame that is true, however it comes with many gameplay aspects that are generally used in survival games like based building, lots of farming etc. The core Gameplay-loop is more like a survival than a Pokemon game.
I‚Äôm having a lot more fun since doing this. Can‚Äôt be bothered with survival games where you‚Äôre constantly battling hot/cold and hunger.
    The problem for me is they always make the hunger deplete way too fast. Same with thirst if implemented. I know you can change it in settings but my first playthrough has been just normal to get the hang of things.

Catching pals is pretty damn easy. Caught lvl 15 dinos and a lvl 15 deer at lvl 7. Also caught a lvl 11 giant bird. All at lvl 7. 

The punk looking Dino kid is a pretty good companion for catching other pals. 

It would be really cool to be able to have all 5 pals out following you.
Is it still fun as a single player game?
    I've only played alone so far and I'm having fun. hoping my friends decide to get it at some point to try co-op
    Haven't touched multiplayer yet and probably never will except for when my wife finally has time and the mental energy to play but solo has been an absolute blast.
    I hear one of the main reasons single player works so well with this game is thanks to the pals, since you will neither feel alone nor will have to do all the work of resource gathering by yourself since you have, well, you know, your pals.
    It‚Äôs server to server, so solo is for your intense grind and base building and then multiplayer is just to chill on
        No?

You just have 1 friend host an open server so you and your friends can drop in and out at any time 24/7.

 That's where the real fun of these games lie.
Explain

No way I got down voted because I wanted to know something lol
    when you first start you make a decision on "world settings" before you actually start playing. here you can choose preset casual-hard or custom. you can have multiple worlds saved with unique settings. you can customize all settings in each preset as well. the settings you can change are on a sliding scale and go from 0/0.1/0.5 to 3/5/10/5000 depending on the setting.

heres what you can modify:

Day time speed

night time speed

EXP rate

Pal Capture Rate

Pal Apperance Rate

Damage from Pals multiplier

Damage to Pals Multiplier

Pal Hunger Depletion Rate

Pal Stamina reduction rate

Pal auto HP Regen rate

    Money can be *exchanged* for goods and services!
        God damn it you beat me too it.
    You can adjust difficulty and the various difficulty gives or takes away things that add to the game. Or you can set a custom difficulty like enemy HP or ATK exp and things of that nature. I can‚Äôt remember the full list of settings but you can change it to how you want to play.
Yeah it honestly isnt really survival. You kill one pal every now and again if you're hungry, normal difficulty hunger drain is basically negligible
    You don't even need to kill Pals for food once you get the Pal that produces berries for you. In our private server, between the 5 of us, we all have at least 100 cooked berries on each of us and at least 150 in our food basket and another 200+ in the fridge
    an hour in you get a feed bag also that auto fees.
    You realize you can have chickens hatch eggs for you right?
I did on gamepass, I found the tutorial borderline useless as it didn't explain how to do things just what to do. Even eating food took pressing every button trying to figure out which worked. Everything felt and looked unfinished. Hearing the survival aspect drops off it nice to hear tho

Maybe in a few patches, but I'm aware the gamepass version is wya before the steam. Version
    The game has a section in the options called survival guide. It explains most of the things.
    To each their own, but I‚Äôm genuinely sick of long winded tutorials that I‚Äôm forced to complete. This game has a short quick one that in theory you don‚Äôt even have to do. I rate that highly. Let me work stuff out for myself, sick of being told how to do absolutely EVRRYTHING in every game I play. Let me learn it myself if I want to. (I understand some want full tutorials, but more games need to make it optional)
Such a great game. Was not expecting how dark some of the cases got.

Edit: Think I still need to actually beat it and start the 2nd game.
    I was not expecting Hacker's Memory to be as good as it was, but it's a really interesting story and it's fun how it intersects with the main story of Cybersleuth.
This is something that has interested me, need to check how it runs on deck
>Honestly this game would be so much better if it didn't mean so far into the survival part.

After a few hours, your Pals start automating everything for you. All we do now is explore, do dungeons, capture more Pals, and fight bosses
    How do I get them to stop ADD'ing out? They do a 1/10th of a task and then go do something else
        lift them and throw them at the task you want them to do, you can see the task assigning to them when you hold the throw button
        I've found that you need to get the Pals that can *only* do one or two things. If they can do everything, they'll try to do everything. Also, if you pick them up and throw them onto a task, it will assign them to it
        Make sure to have clear pathways between tasks, chests and other spots they go to. There are very annoying hitboxes on few stuff you build that will block pathing and fuck with AI, also they care a lot about the way stuff is facing so don't build stations facing wall on 4th floor. 

On my 2nd playthrough(wanted to restart to try stuff out) I went straight away to big flat zone and built a lot of wooden floor before even placing my tablet.
Killing Pals is the best part! Or putting them to work on your compound. 

You can host a server and change the hunger options and edit the game rules.
In Pokemon it was presented more as a "partnership" after the initial taming; in Palworld there is no ambiguity.
    Partnership... Except for the hundreds of Pokemon you have sitting in stasis. 

Gotta catch em all, to sit in a void for all eternity? 

Dark as fuck.
    Except for those two games that basically called it slavery...
    It's not slavery because they like it  
They smile therefore it's not Stockholm syndrome

Pok√©mon games are weird man  
Even if they try to make it ambiguous and friendly, the whole concept has always been weird when you look at it 

Oh well, I'm having fun with palworld now
If by ceremonically you mean merging all the shit pals into one pal, and then butchering that pal in front of them while they're eating breakfast
Isn't that what employers basically do when staff are under performing in the real world? Threaten them with the sack which leads to no money which leads to starvation?
Well. Technically they are not humans and they are not on planet earth, it's just fantasy. they are just pixels and you can do this sort of stuff in loads of games. It isn't like the game forces you to do that you do it you are making them slaves out of your own will. Much worse goes on in games like rust and ark.¬†
    I don't recall anyone saying you're forced to capture the NPCs? Just that you can, and given that they are shaped like a human, act like a human, and speak like a human, its relatively easy to compare it to slavery as a joke. Especially since the humans sell so damn well üòÇ 500 or so gold per. 

But really, you're taking a joke about the games mechanics a little personally. If you don't wanna capture the syndicate dudes and just wanna kill them, go for it. Play how you want to
You think getting one of the highest played games is luck? I dunno man. I would say the game needs to be pretty damn good.
    No, I think regardless of effort if you're unlucky your game will go nowhere. You can have the greatest idea and solid execution, and it doesn't matter if nobody finds your game.  

The lethal companies of game releases are one in tens of thousands, if not more.
        Maybe. Do you have any examples of really solid games that never got any traction?
            Off the top of my head, no. That said, once the next steam next fest rolls around you could look at the steamdb charts for the majority of games that get featured there and you'll find that they either gained only a small temporary influx in sales, or none at all. That isn't to say that every game there is a gem to everyone because that's too subjective, but that many games that could be gems just never get the opportunity/exposure to get to that point.  

So yeah, I'm not saying these people put in no effort and don't deserve their game taking off, just that effort is not a guarantee and without the resources to make large advertising pushes (and even then) there is a significant chance that the game flies completely under the radar.
                So you have a theory, but no evidence.

I don't completely disagree with you though. I do think some luck is involved as well, but imo the luck really comes down to finding a formula with broad appeal. There probably are solid games with low sales, but they probably don't have broad appeal.

In general though, I think that to even have a chance at being a highly played game, it's gotta be a damn good game.
                    Steps To Getting Downvoted On Reddit

1. Locate a comment that is one (or more) of the following: an overgeneralization, an opinion presented as fact, or an unsupported conclusion

2. Request *any* form of evidence: data, examples, screenshots, tweets, literally anything

3. Once it is clear that no evidence can/will be provided, note that there does not seem to be evidence to support the initial claim.

4. lmaoooo get fucked asshole LOL substantiated claims are BORING and for fuckin' NERDS get out of here with your reasonable discourse

5. DAE feel like 2+2 actually = 5???
            I can give you 3 - which of course are my subjective opinions (otherwise the games would be popular obviously lol)

Shadowrun (2007) Xbox/PC - one of the very first cross-platform FPS games, has a 'buy system' similar to CS:GO, and abilities like that of Overwatch or Valorant (teleport dash through wall/floor, place a tree of healing) 

\[personally, teleporting through walls in an FPS game in 2007 was so cool and revolutionary to me\]

- maybe it was just too ahead of its time, but apparently I just read that the servers are still live and running

Battleborn (2016) PS/Xbox/PC - I believe this to be the best example in terms of luck. They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms. It was a 5v5 team based game sort of like LoL in the sense of PvPvE where you can capture points to get AI to fight alongside you (I think that's how LoL works, at least) - but it was First Person, and the first time anything like this released on console.

- unfortunately for them, they released their game within 21 days of one of the most popular games of all time, Overwatch, so lots of direct comparisons were made between the 2 FPS games.. and only one survived in the end

Blazing Sails (2021) \[2023 official release\] PC - you show this game to a Sea of Thieves diehard and after 4 seconds they will call it a knockoff and dismiss it, which is what happened at the game's launch. I played SoT only a couple times, and while I admired the graphics and mechanics - I quickly lost interest after discovering that majority of the gameplay is PvE oriented, extremely repetitive, and lacks hardly any variables in the game (only 3 different guns, 1 melee weapon... this still stands true 6 years later)

(I am biased, I am not going to try to pretend otherwise lol) 

- this is why I was excited to come across Blazing Sails.. it is everything I wish SoT was. It removes the PvE aspect out of the game, leaving only fast paced PvP left. And most notably, the game is objectively 100x better in the area that has been SoT's #1 most well known issue for 6 years running now: Hit Registration. The game also launched with I believe around 12+ weapons, so it already had more depth in terms of variables (currently 21+ weapons) 

The hit reg in this game is one of the best I've seen in a game, which surprised me for an indie cartoon pirate game. I used to be active in the game's discord when it first came out and told the devs how good the hit reg was, especially in comparison to SoT.. and that it should be one of the main selling points

I believe it to be a combination of bad luck in terms of not gaining any traction, not having any big streamers play, as well possibly bad marketing in distinguishing themselves from SoT from the start. It is one of the few games I've seen on Steam that has a 90% rating, and nearly every negative review is about there being a lack of players, not the actual game itself.

Blazing Sails just released their official trailer a couple months ago, and the last line of it is "...so feast your eyes on an Indie game, so eye-watering, you'll mistake the work of one family of 4 in Belgium, for that of hundreds in a multi-national, AAA studio - then gasp in utter disbelief at which one actually delivers accurate hit reg"
                > They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms.

Just wanted to say you reminded me of Monday Night Combat. A TPS-MOBA. I freaking loved that game!
                    dude.. what!?- how have I never seen that game?

I just watched some videos, and that looks way ahead of its time.. idk how I haven't seen that before :o
                Yeah, there's definitely games that are overhyped and there's definitely games that are underhyped, and luck definitely IS a part of it...

The problem is that the entire conversation is sort of hamstrung by the fact that "Luck" is such a nebulous concept. Like, we all more or less know what we mean by "luck", except there's a lot of real-world complexity that the word "luck" hand-waves away--albeit unintentionally.

To use a recent example, is it luck that Lies of P was such an unexpected smash hit yet Lords of the Fallen had an ambivalent, mostly lukewarm reception? 

Sort of? But what do i/we mean by "luck" in this instance, right? We're not just saying "oh yeah, it's a total dice roll"... Realistically, the "luck" came from the fact that Lies of P was a unique blend of ideas (Fairy Tale x Souls), part of it came from the fact that it was--in many people's estimation--the first game to go toe-to-toe with FromSoft's combat design. 

And so there's a luck factor to that: Because Lies of P came out a couple weeks prior to LotF, people perhaps evaluated LotF more critically than they would have if Lies of P hadn't come out at all. 

But IS that luck? Hard to say, because there were a million-billion decisions made along the way that led to the outcome that we now might refer to as "lucky" or "unlucky"

Idk, not really agreeing or disagreeing, just find it an interesting topic.
        The mentality that everything comes down to luck is cope. Success is earned.
Im guessing streamers because this game seems to be the perfect type of game to stream. its cute and has a lot to play around with.
I've seen three posts about it in the last 24 hours. There's your marketing. Wouldn't be surprised if some percentage of these posts are from the marketing team themselves.
what? lol

players or NPCs?
    NPCs. There's no pvp
        what do NPCs do? are there fixed settlements or are they just other survivors or how does that work?  I find the steam page description rather lacking
            You can make them a camp slave or make them fight for you like a Pok√©mon. Or you can sell them for a good price to the black market trader.
Yes that‚Äôs right
When my penguins haul my wood around they balance it on their head and just kind of bounce around my camp with it. It's adorable and my wife and I are having a blast
It is adorable. You can actually interact with your Pals and their reactions are so damn cute! It makes you feel even worse for making them work in the quarries or slaughtering the rest of their species :c
Yeah same deal with the FiFAs and CODs, can just push out any garbage when you have a mindless horde buying everything¬†
    Because despite what a lot of people might want to believe, 80% of the Pokemon playerbase are under the age of 14 and have barely any reference to how good the game should be, let alone whether the game is actually any good or not.

When you're a kid any game can be good...
        Not true, the younger generation is almost, if not more, obsessed with retro games now than ever before with help from youtube. It's one of the reasons the old pokemon games won't drop in value, despite having a bazillion copies each, because the newer generations want to re buy gameboys/ds and play those games they missed out on that us adults keep saying were the best.

And God forbid Nintendo re releases them on Switch and make themselves an insurmountable fortune with the profits they'd make.
[deleted]
    Yep, I didn't even buy S/V because it's just such unexcusable dogshit. They then admitted it, after the outrage, and instead of fixing the game, released dlc....bruh. They have zero reason to make the game better so I'll just be sad and not buy their games anymore. I know it doesn't make a difference but there are SO many games that come out that are more worth my time and money
        [deleted]
            When the spin offs on gamecube have better animations and frame rate then games on the switch, you'd think they'd actually start caring about the quality control. 

It's just such a sad fall from grace seeing every game get worse and worse. Hopefully Nintendo starts spreading the license around more. Until then I'll keep enjoying actual good games like bg3 lol
I almost think they made exp share mandatory out of spite.¬†
Buying two copies of Palworlds now due to this post. Thanks for the suggestion.
Yeah, I kinda wish they returned to 2D in a similar vein to octopath, but that's never gonna happen at this rate.

Although I do think we still have a chance to see another Legends game which I want to see.
    Legends Arceus was the only game that actually justified the jump to 3D instead of being 3D just because. 

Arceus was revolutionary for a Pokemon game, but compared to the jumps other franchises have made, it's rather tame and half baked.
You‚Äôre right! Gonna have to let em know.
    The gamepass version is not compatible with steam version right now. It‚Äôs 3 months outdated.
You pay for gamepass, it's not free on gamepass.

Free on gamepass would be if it were a free trial of gamepass, which they are much stricter about now.
This! And a filter for chests... God I hate when my Pals put a pile of wood and stone in EVERY chest in my base...
But we rarely see mons working in the world,not just for the protagonist. Every so often we might see Machamp being used for construction, but given what the creatures can do, the Pok√©mon world should look like the Flintstone world, where the creature's abilities are used in everyday life.
Keep being butthurt buddy. Keep being butthurt üòÇ
My friends and I played Craftopia before PalWorld was announced and that was a shit ton of ridiculous fun (I fully recommend it, don't listen to those that say it's been EA for 3+ years as being a bad thing). Then we saw PalWorld and we were hyped about that game ever since!
Do you even look into anything you're saying? Craftopia is still very much supported. Was updated last month even. Also a separate dev team than Palworld. The AI I don't know much about but not sure why that would be an issue if true.  These games aren't meant to be played forever. You soak up all the content and move on to something else. Check back in in six months or a year and do another play thru with new content. Rinse and repeat
    I will likely never understand people expecting infinite replayability from every game, most games are good to complete once and be done or maybe pick up much later to give it another run through.
No. They will stop actually making clever designs and settle for 5 minute craft videogames and hope it reaches the same level of funny meme. 

Not every genre of videogames can be made with free UE5 assets and AI generating enemies.
    Developers already do that on their own or are you one of those COD players
        And how exactly does further enabling to do shitty games help that case?
Fuck off
I think you should do yours: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154230/AI\_Art\_Impostor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154230/AI_Art_Impostor/?curator_clanid=41648656)

If you read my comment thoroughly you could see I was not talking about Palworld.
    I thought you are talking about craftopia. Well its good then that palworld has nothing to do with this AI game
It already dwarfs Ark like the sun dwarfs the Earth
Just terrible optimization
Lots of it is the maps, you can reduce the space by only installing some of them.  The game has like 10 different world maps that are pretty detailed and a lot of extra data tied to them plus unique textures.
Damn, I forgot abt that i thought it was always free for some reason, no one seems to be mentioning it. Ive seen game news sites say Palworld's the most played paid game of all time,

  Regardless tho 2nd place is still insane. Pubg was literally impossible to miss back then, same with games like among us i mean literally every single creator I watched was playing these games, but I haven't seen almost anyone posting vids about Palword even now a couple of days after ea release. I just don't get how the game's so dang popular
Palworld is not in an active lawsuit with Nintendo.
    My bad, Nintendo is in the process of finalizing their lawsuit because palworld is in clear copyright violation ü§¶ use commonsense
        What exactly are they in violation of? I highly doubt Palworld would've even hit market if they had grounds for litigation given it was anmounced im 2021. The person who was selling mods using their IP already got a cease and desist.

Also copyright infringement isn't a common sense thing. Or maybe it is to you. Are you a patent lawyer?  

Even if they did sue it doesn't mean they would win either. The proof would have to be incontrovertible and I've yet to see anything unless you know something nobody else does.
            Not to mention the headlines for palworld is "Pok√©mon with guns", like hello??? Doesn't take a rocket scientist ü§¶
                Those are journalists who write those headlines not the developers...
                Absolutely nowhere on the game does it say that, dude you ate so full of shit. Every sentence you have made on this post is pure lies. Just because you read some person on the internet saying it's pokemon with guns doesn't mean it's official palworld news. You are either 12 or just an idiot

Do I need to say more?
                You clearly aren't reading any of the links you posted lmao. These are all quotes from the above articles. 

"The Pok√©mon Company also said that the investigations are in response to having received many inquiries regarding an unnamed game by another company released in January"

"Palworld was also in development for many years before this so this is not exactly news to The Pok√©mon Company and Nintendo that this game and its Pok√©mon-adjacent monsters exist. This reads like a statement that they should probably say something given how big this game has gotten, though I would be amazed if this ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù turned up anything that could cause real harm to Palworld, which at the time of this writing, has just passed eight million copies sold in six days."
            It's just commonsense buddy, a game that has nothing to do with Nintendo comes out with a game that has "Pok√©mon" that are basically ripping off Pok√©mon; sorry you can't piece that together?
                I only responded to you because you said they were in the middle of an active lawsuit which is verifiably untrue. Idk why youre being a dick about it. 

"Basically" doesn't sound iron clad to me personally. If it was so open and shut then sales would likely *already* be blocked and it would be incredibly easy to point out where exactly the infringement is. Palworld isn't the first game to use the catching monsters concept and Pok√©mon wasn't the first. Do you have actual examples? Have you played the game? 

The person who did side by sides on blender of 3D models that went viral already recanted their statements and admitted to exaggerating the similarities. 

Could Nintendo sue? Sure. Anyone can sue anyone for anything. Do they have grounds? It doesn't seem like it, but I suppose we will see. I just highly doubt Nintendo would've let Palworld sell 6 million copies if it's as cut and dry as you are implying.
No its not you just completely made that shit up.
Arceus is like bedof and palworld is like arceus
Pokemon Violet in all it's shoddy, bland glory sold 23.2 MILLION copies. Nintendo isn't missing out on anything.
Strict up survival is pretty tame that is true, however it comes with many gameplay aspects that are generally used in survival games like based building, lots of farming etc. The core Gameplay-loop is more like a survival than a Pokemon game.
The problem for me is they always make the hunger deplete way too fast. Same with thirst if implemented. I know you can change it in settings but my first playthrough has been just normal to get the hang of things.

Catching pals is pretty damn easy. Caught lvl 15 dinos and a lvl 15 deer at lvl 7. Also caught a lvl 11 giant bird. All at lvl 7. 

The punk looking Dino kid is a pretty good companion for catching other pals. 

It would be really cool to be able to have all 5 pals out following you.
I've only played alone so far and I'm having fun. hoping my friends decide to get it at some point to try co-op
Haven't touched multiplayer yet and probably never will except for when my wife finally has time and the mental energy to play but solo has been an absolute blast.
I hear one of the main reasons single player works so well with this game is thanks to the pals, since you will neither feel alone nor will have to do all the work of resource gathering by yourself since you have, well, you know, your pals.
It‚Äôs server to server, so solo is for your intense grind and base building and then multiplayer is just to chill on
    No?

You just have 1 friend host an open server so you and your friends can drop in and out at any time 24/7.

 That's where the real fun of these games lie.
when you first start you make a decision on "world settings" before you actually start playing. here you can choose preset casual-hard or custom. you can have multiple worlds saved with unique settings. you can customize all settings in each preset as well. the settings you can change are on a sliding scale and go from 0/0.1/0.5 to 3/5/10/5000 depending on the setting.

heres what you can modify:

Day time speed

night time speed

EXP rate

Pal Capture Rate

Pal Apperance Rate

Damage from Pals multiplier

Damage to Pals Multiplier

Pal Hunger Depletion Rate

Pal Stamina reduction rate

Pal auto HP Regen rate

Pal sleep health Regeneration Rate

Damage from Player Multiplier

Damage to Player Multiplier

Player Hunger Depletion Rate

Player Stamina Reduction Rate

Player Auto HP Regeneration Rate

Player Sleep HP Regeneration Rate

Damage to Structure Multiplier

Structure Deterioration Rate

Maximum number of dropped items in a world

Gatherable Items Multiplier

Gatherable objects respawn interval

dropped items multiplier

Time (h) to incubate Massive Egg

enable raid events

Death Penalty

Max number of guilds

Max pals working at base
Money can be *exchanged* for goods and services!
    God damn it you beat me too it.
You can adjust difficulty and the various difficulty gives or takes away things that add to the game. Or you can set a custom difficulty like enemy HP or ATK exp and things of that nature. I can‚Äôt remember the full list of settings but you can change it to how you want to play.
You don't even need to kill Pals for food once you get the Pal that produces berries for you. In our private server, between the 5 of us, we all have at least 100 cooked berries on each of us and at least 150 in our food basket and another 200+ in the fridge
an hour in you get a feed bag also that auto fees.
You realize you can have chickens hatch eggs for you right?
The game has a section in the options called survival guide. It explains most of the things.
To each their own, but I‚Äôm genuinely sick of long winded tutorials that I‚Äôm forced to complete. This game has a short quick one that in theory you don‚Äôt even have to do. I rate that highly. Let me work stuff out for myself, sick of being told how to do absolutely EVRRYTHING in every game I play. Let me learn it myself if I want to. (I understand some want full tutorials, but more games need to make it optional)
I was not expecting Hacker's Memory to be as good as it was, but it's a really interesting story and it's fun how it intersects with the main story of Cybersleuth.
How do I get them to stop ADD'ing out? They do a 1/10th of a task and then go do something else
    lift them and throw them at the task you want them to do, you can see the task assigning to them when you hold the throw button
    I've found that you need to get the Pals that can *only* do one or two things. If they can do everything, they'll try to do everything. Also, if you pick them up and throw them onto a task, it will assign them to it
    Make sure to have clear pathways between tasks, chests and other spots they go to. There are very annoying hitboxes on few stuff you build that will block pathing and fuck with AI, also they care a lot about the way stuff is facing so don't build stations facing wall on 4th floor. 

On my 2nd playthrough(wanted to restart to try stuff out) I went straight away to big flat zone and built a lot of wooden floor before even placing my tablet.
Partnership... Except for the hundreds of Pokemon you have sitting in stasis. 

Gotta catch em all, to sit in a void for all eternity? 

Dark as fuck.
Except for those two games that basically called it slavery...
It's not slavery because they like it  
They smile therefore it's not Stockholm syndrome

Pok√©mon games are weird man  
Even if they try to make it ambiguous and friendly, the whole concept has always been weird when you look at it 

Oh well, I'm having fun with palworld now
I don't recall anyone saying you're forced to capture the NPCs? Just that you can, and given that they are shaped like a human, act like a human, and speak like a human, its relatively easy to compare it to slavery as a joke. Especially since the humans sell so damn well üòÇ 500 or so gold per. 

But really, you're taking a joke about the games mechanics a little personally. If you don't wanna capture the syndicate dudes and just wanna kill them, go for it. Play how you want to
No, I think regardless of effort if you're unlucky your game will go nowhere. You can have the greatest idea and solid execution, and it doesn't matter if nobody finds your game.  

The lethal companies of game releases are one in tens of thousands, if not more.
    Maybe. Do you have any examples of really solid games that never got any traction?
        Off the top of my head, no. That said, once the next steam next fest rolls around you could look at the steamdb charts for the majority of games that get featured there and you'll find that they either gained only a small temporary influx in sales, or none at all. That isn't to say that every game there is a gem to everyone because that's too subjective, but that many games that could be gems just never get the opportunity/exposure to get to that point.  

So yeah, I'm not saying these people put in no effort and don't deserve their game taking off, just that effort is not a guarantee and without the resources to make large advertising pushes (and even then) there is a significant chance that the game flies completely under the radar.
            So you have a theory, but no evidence.

I don't completely disagree with you though. I do think some luck is involved as well, but imo the luck really comes down to finding a formula with broad appeal. There probably are solid games with low sales, but they probably don't have broad appeal.

In general though, I think that to even have a chance at being a highly played game, it's gotta be a damn good game.
                Steps To Getting Downvoted On Reddit

1. Locate a comment that is one (or more) of the following: an overgeneralization, an opinion presented as fact, or an unsupported conclusion

2. Request *any* form of evidence: data, examples, screenshots, tweets, literally anything

3. Once it is clear that no evidence can/will be provided, note that there does not seem to be evidence to support the initial claim.

4. lmaoooo get fucked asshole LOL substantiated claims are BORING and for fuckin' NERDS get out of here with your reasonable discourse

5. DAE feel like 2+2 actually = 5???
        I can give you 3 - which of course are my subjective opinions (otherwise the games would be popular obviously lol)

Shadowrun (2007) Xbox/PC - one of the very first cross-platform FPS games, has a 'buy system' similar to CS:GO, and abilities like that of Overwatch or Valorant (teleport dash through wall/floor, place a tree of healing) 

\[personally, teleporting through walls in an FPS game in 2007 was so cool and revolutionary to me\]

- maybe it was just too ahead of its time, but apparently I just read that the servers are still live and running

Battleborn (2016) PS/Xbox/PC - I believe this to be the best example in terms of luck. They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms. It was a 5v5 team based game sort of like LoL in the sense of PvPvE where you can capture points to get AI to fight alongside you (I think that's how LoL works, at least) - but it was First Person, and the first time anything like this released on console.

- unfortunately for them, they released their game within 21 days of one of the most popular games of all time, Overwatch, so lots of direct comparisons were made between the 2 FPS games.. and only one survived in the end

Blazing Sails (2021) \[2023 official release\] PC - you show this game to a Sea of Thieves diehard and after 4 seconds they will call it a knockoff and dismiss it, which is what happened at the game's launch. I played SoT only a couple times, and while I admired the graphics and mechanics - I quickly lost interest after discovering that majority of the gameplay is PvE oriented, extremely repetitive, and lacks hardly any variables in the game (only 3 different guns, 1 melee weapon... this still stands true 6 years later)

(I am biased, I am not going to try to pretend otherwise lol) 

- this is why I was excited to come across Blazing Sails.. it is everything I wish SoT was. It removes the PvE aspect out of the game, leaving only fast paced PvP left. And most notably, the game is objectively 100x better in the area that has been SoT's #1 most well known issue for 6 years running now: Hit Registration. The game also launched with I believe around 12+ weapons, so it already had more depth in terms of variables (currently 21+ weapons) 

The hit reg in this game is one of the best I've seen in a game, which surprised me for an indie cartoon pirate game. I used to be active in the game's discord when it first came out and told the devs how good the hit reg was, especially in comparison to SoT.. and that it should be one of the main selling points

I believe it to be a combination of bad luck in terms of not gaining any traction, not having any big streamers play, as well possibly bad marketing in distinguishing themselves from SoT from the start. It is one of the few games I've seen on Steam that has a 90% rating, and nearly every negative review is about there being a lack of players, not the actual game itself.

Blazing Sails just released their official trailer a couple months ago, and the last line of it is "...so feast your eyes on an Indie game, so eye-watering, you'll mistake the work of one family of 4 in Belgium, for that of hundreds in a multi-national, AAA studio - then gasp in utter disbelief at which one actually delivers accurate hit reg"
            > They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms.

Just wanted to say you reminded me of Monday Night Combat. A TPS-MOBA. I freaking loved that game!
                dude.. what!?- how have I never seen that game?

I just watched some videos, and that looks way ahead of its time.. idk how I haven't seen that before :o
            Yeah, there's definitely games that are overhyped and there's definitely games that are underhyped, and luck definitely IS a part of it...

The problem is that the entire conversation is sort of hamstrung by the fact that "Luck" is such a nebulous concept. Like, we all more or less know what we mean by "luck", except there's a lot of real-world complexity that the word "luck" hand-waves away--albeit unintentionally.

To use a recent example, is it luck that Lies of P was such an unexpected smash hit yet Lords of the Fallen had an ambivalent, mostly lukewarm reception? 

Sort of? But what do i/we mean by "luck" in this instance, right? We're not just saying "oh yeah, it's a total dice roll"... Realistically, the "luck" came from the fact that Lies of P was a unique blend of ideas (Fairy Tale x Souls), part of it came from the fact that it was--in many people's estimation--the first game to go toe-to-toe with FromSoft's combat design. 

And so there's a luck factor to that: Because Lies of P came out a couple weeks prior to LotF, people perhaps evaluated LotF more critically than they would have if Lies of P hadn't come out at all. 

But IS that luck? Hard to say, because there were a million-billion decisions made along the way that led to the outcome that we now might refer to as "lucky" or "unlucky"

Idk, not really agreeing or disagreeing, just find it an interesting topic.
    The mentality that everything comes down to luck is cope. Success is earned.
NPCs. There's no pvp
    what do NPCs do? are there fixed settlements or are they just other survivors or how does that work?  I find the steam page description rather lacking
        You can make them a camp slave or make them fight for you like a Pok√©mon. Or you can sell them for a good price to the black market trader.
Because despite what a lot of people might want to believe, 80% of the Pokemon playerbase are under the age of 14 and have barely any reference to how good the game should be, let alone whether the game is actually any good or not.

When you're a kid any game can be good...
    Not true, the younger generation is almost, if not more, obsessed with retro games now than ever before with help from youtube. It's one of the reasons the old pokemon games won't drop in value, despite having a bazillion copies each, because the newer generations want to re buy gameboys/ds and play those games they missed out on that us adults keep saying were the best.

And God forbid Nintendo re releases them on Switch and make themselves an insurmountable fortune with the profits they'd make.
Yep, I didn't even buy S/V because it's just such unexcusable dogshit. They then admitted it, after the outrage, and instead of fixing the game, released dlc....bruh. They have zero reason to make the game better so I'll just be sad and not buy their games anymore. I know it doesn't make a difference but there are SO many games that come out that are more worth my time and money
    [deleted]
        When the spin offs on gamecube have better animations and frame rate then games on the switch, you'd think they'd actually start caring about the quality control. 

It's just such a sad fall from grace seeing every game get worse and worse. Hopefully Nintendo starts spreading the license around more. Until then I'll keep enjoying actual good games like bg3 lol
Legends Arceus was the only game that actually justified the jump to 3D instead of being 3D just because. 

Arceus was revolutionary for a Pokemon game, but compared to the jumps other franchises have made, it's rather tame and half baked.
The gamepass version is not compatible with steam version right now. It‚Äôs 3 months outdated.
I will likely never understand people expecting infinite replayability from every game, most games are good to complete once and be done or maybe pick up much later to give it another run through.
Developers already do that on their own or are you one of those COD players
    And how exactly does further enabling to do shitty games help that case?
I thought you are talking about craftopia. Well its good then that palworld has nothing to do with this AI game
My bad, Nintendo is in the process of finalizing their lawsuit because palworld is in clear copyright violation ü§¶ use commonsense
    What exactly are they in violation of? I highly doubt Palworld would've even hit market if they had grounds for litigation given it was anmounced im 2021. The person who was selling mods using their IP already got a cease and desist.

Also copyright infringement isn't a common sense thing. Or maybe it is to you. Are you a patent lawyer?  

Even if they did sue it doesn't mean they would win either. The proof would have to be incontrovertible and I've yet to see anything unless you know something nobody else does.
        Not to mention the headlines for palworld is "Pok√©mon with guns", like hello??? Doesn't take a rocket scientist ü§¶
            Those are journalists who write those headlines not the developers...
            Absolutely nowhere on the game does it say that, dude you ate so full of shit. Every sentence you have made on this post is pure lies. Just because you read some person on the internet saying it's pokemon with guns doesn't mean it's official palworld news. You are either 12 or just an idiot

‚ÄúWe have not granted any permission for the use of Pok√©mon intellectual property or assets in that game,‚Äù the company said in a statement.

‚ÄúWe intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pok√©mon,‚Äù it added.


Do I need to say more?
            You clearly aren't reading any of the links you posted lmao. These are all quotes from the above articles. 

"The Pok√©mon Company also said that the investigations are in response to having received many inquiries regarding an unnamed game by another company released in January"

"While it is significant that The Pok√©mon Company issued a statement about this situation, the way it reads does not really imply anything much would probably happen here. Nintendo has says they haven‚Äôt licensed any IP or assets to Palworld which I mean, of course they didn‚Äôt."

"As for IP, clearly no actual terms or exact characters from Pok√©mon are being used. Nintendo immediately got a Pok√©mon reskin mod for Palworld taken down when it went live, and I cannot see them having much of a case comparing two electric mice and proving that the concept infringes on Pikachu. You can‚Äôt copyright the concept of an electric mouse."

"Palworld was also in development for many years before this so this is not exactly news to The Pok√©mon Company and Nintendo that this game and its Pok√©mon-adjacent monsters exist.

‚ÄúWe have not granted any permission for the use of Pok√©mon intellectual property or assets in that game,‚Äù the company said in a statement.

‚ÄúWe intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pok√©mon,‚Äù it added.


Do I need to say more?
        You clearly aren't reading any of the links you posted lmao. These are all quotes from the above articles. 

"The Pok√©mon Company also said that the investigations are in response to having received many inquiries regarding an unnamed game by another company released in January"

"While it is significant that The Pok√©mon Company issued a statement about this situation, the way it reads does not really imply anything much would probably happen here. Nintendo has says they haven‚Äôt licensed any IP or assets to Palworld which I mean, of course they didn‚Äôt."

"As for IP, clearly no actual terms or exact characters from Pok√©mon are being used. Nintendo immediately got a Pok√©mon reskin mod for Palworld taken down when it went live, and I cannot see them having much of a case comparing two electric mice and proving that the concept infringes on Pikachu. You can‚Äôt copyright the concept of an electric mouse."

"Palworld was also in development for many years before this so this is not exactly news to The Pok√©mon Company and Nintendo that this game and its Pok√©mon-adjacent monsters exist. This reads like a statement that they should probably say something given how big this game has gotten, though I would be amazed if this ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù turned up anything that could cause real harm to Palworld, which at the time of this writing, has just passed eight million copies sold in six days."
    It's just commonsense buddy, a game that has nothing to do with Nintendo comes out with a game that has "Pok√©mon" that are basically ripping off Pok√©mon; sorry you can't piece that together?
        I only responded to you because you said they were in the middle of an active lawsuit which is verifiably untrue. Idk why youre being a dick about it. 

"Basically" doesn't sound iron clad to me personally. If it was so open and shut then sales would likely *already* be blocked and it would be incredibly easy to point out where exactly the infringement is. Palworld isn't the first game to use the catching monsters concept and Pok√©mon wasn't the first. Do you have actual examples? Have you played the game? 

The person who did side by sides on blender of 3D models that went viral already recanted their statements and admitted to exaggerating the similarities. 

Could Nintendo sue? Sure. Anyone can sue anyone for anything. Do they have grounds? It doesn't seem like it, but I suppose we will see. I just highly doubt Nintendo would've let Palworld sell 6 million copies if it's as cut and dry as you are implying.
Off the top of my head, no. That said, once the next steam next fest rolls around you could look at the steamdb charts for the majority of games that get featured there and you'll find that they either gained only a small temporary influx in sales, or none at all. That isn't to say that every game there is a gem to everyone because that's too subjective, but that many games that could be gems just never get the opportunity/exposure to get to that point.  

So yeah, I'm not saying these people put in no effort and don't deserve their game taking off, just that effort is not a guarantee and without the resources to make large advertising pushes (and even then) there is a significant chance that the game flies completely under the radar.
    So you have a theory, but no evidence.

I don't completely disagree with you though. I do think some luck is involved as well, but imo the luck really comes down to finding a formula with broad appeal. There probably are solid games with low sales, but they probably don't have broad appeal.

In general though, I think that to even have a chance at being a highly played game, it's gotta be a damn good game.
        Steps To Getting Downvoted On Reddit

1. Locate a comment that is one (or more) of the following: an overgeneralization, an opinion presented as fact, or an unsupported conclusion

2. Request *any* form of evidence: data, examples, screenshots, tweets, literally anything

3. Once it is clear that no evidence can/will be provided, note that there does not seem to be evidence to support the initial claim.

4. lmaoooo get fucked asshole LOL substantiated claims are BORING and for fuckin' NERDS get out of here with your reasonable discourse

5. DAE feel like 2+2 actually = 5???
I can give you 3 - which of course are my subjective opinions (otherwise the games would be popular obviously lol)

Shadowrun (2007) Xbox/PC - one of the very first cross-platform FPS games, has a 'buy system' similar to CS:GO, and abilities like that of Overwatch or Valorant (teleport dash through wall/floor, place a tree of healing) 

\[personally, teleporting through walls in an FPS game in 2007 was so cool and revolutionary to me\]

- maybe it was just too ahead of its time, but apparently I just read that the servers are still live and running

Battleborn (2016) PS/Xbox/PC - I believe this to be the best example in terms of luck. They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms. It was a 5v5 team based game sort of like LoL in the sense of PvPvE where you can capture points to get AI to fight alongside you (I think that's how LoL works, at least) - but it was First Person, and the first time anything like this released on console.

- unfortunately for them, they released their game within 21 days of one of the most popular games of all time, Overwatch, so lots of direct comparisons were made between the 2 FPS games.. and only one survived in the end

Blazing Sails (2021) \[2023 official release\] PC - you show this game to a Sea of Thieves diehard and after 4 seconds they will call it a knockoff and dismiss it, which is what happened at the game's launch. I played SoT only a couple times, and while I admired the graphics and mechanics - I quickly lost interest after discovering that majority of the gameplay is PvE oriented, extremely repetitive, and lacks hardly any variables in the game (only 3 different guns, 1 melee weapon... this still stands true 6 years later)

(I am biased, I am not going to try to pretend otherwise lol) 

- this is why I was excited to come across Blazing Sails.. it is everything I wish SoT was. It removes the PvE aspect out of the game, leaving only fast paced PvP left. And most notably, the game is objectively 100x better in the area that has been SoT's #1 most well known issue for 6 years running now: Hit Registration. The game also launched with I believe around 12+ weapons, so it already had more depth in terms of variables (currently 21+ weapons) 

The hit reg in this game is one of the best I've seen in a game, which surprised me for an indie cartoon pirate game. I used to be active in the game's discord when it first came out and told the devs how good the hit reg was, especially in comparison to SoT.. and that it should be one of the main selling points

I believe it to be a combination of bad luck in terms of not gaining any traction, not having any big streamers play, as well possibly bad marketing in distinguishing themselves from SoT from the start. It is one of the few games I've seen on Steam that has a 90% rating, and nearly every negative review is about there being a lack of players, not the actual game itself.

Blazing Sails just released their official trailer a couple months ago, and the last line of it is "...so feast your eyes on an Indie game, so eye-watering, you'll mistake the work of one family of 4 in Belgium, for that of hundreds in a multi-national, AAA studio - then gasp in utter disbelief at which one actually delivers accurate hit reg"
    > They created the first FPS-MOBA game (correct me if I'm wrong) for all platforms.

Just wanted to say you reminded me of Monday Night Combat. A TPS-MOBA. I freaking loved that game!
        dude.. what!?- how have I never seen that game?

I just watched some videos, and that looks way ahead of its time.. idk how I haven't seen that before :o
    Yeah, there's definitely games that are overhyped and there's definitely games that are underhyped, and luck definitely IS a part of it...

The problem is that the entire conversation is sort of hamstrung by the fact that "Luck" is such a nebulous concept. Like, we all more or less know what we mean by "luck", except there's a lot of real-world complexity that the word "luck" hand-waves away--albeit unintentionally.

To use a recent example, is it luck that Lies of P was such an unexpected smash hit yet Lords of the Fallen had an ambivalent, mostly lukewarm reception? 

Sort of? But what do i/we mean by "luck" in this instance, right? We're not just saying "oh yeah, it's a total dice roll"... Realistically, the "luck" came from the fact that Lies of P was a unique blend of ideas (Fairy Tale x Souls), part of it came from the fact that it was--in many people's estimation--the first game to go toe-to-toe with FromSoft's combat design. 

And so there's a luck factor to that: Because Lies of P came out a couple weeks prior to LotF, people perhaps evaluated LotF more critically than they would have if Lies of P hadn't come out at all. 

But IS that luck? Hard to say, because there were a million-billion decisions made along the way that led to the outcome that we now might refer to as "lucky" or "unlucky"

Idk, not really agreeing or disagreeing, just find it an interesting topic.
You can make them a camp slave or make them fight for you like a Pok√©mon. Or you can sell them for a good price to the black market trader.
When the spin offs on gamecube have better animations and frame rate then games on the switch, you'd think they'd actually start caring about the quality control. 

It's just such a sad fall from grace seeing every game get worse and worse. Hopefully Nintendo starts spreading the license around more. Until then I'll keep enjoying actual good games like bg3 lol
