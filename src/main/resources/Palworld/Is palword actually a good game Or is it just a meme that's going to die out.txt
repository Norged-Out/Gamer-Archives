[[Is palword actually a good game Or is it just a meme that's going to die out]]


I've seen gameplay of palword, and to be quite honest the game looks janky as hell and looks so unpolished. It looks like an AI tried to replicate a game with Pokémon and guns in it. The game just looks unfinished.

Is this game carried by hype, or am I missing something about this game? I've always had a itch for a good pokemon game, and this game doesn't seem to interest me.


I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't advise comparing it to pokemon. It has base building and not much of a story. I'd compare it more to Ark or rust.   


I don't think the game is very janky, it felt fine to me. There might be the occasional bug but I'll look past those for a few more weeks.
    Yeah the Pokemon with guns summary that so many people keep repeating is kind of misleading, more like Ark with Pokemon. 

People going in thinking it is more of a Pokemon game are being misled imo.
        It is 100% Ark with Pokemon.  Anyone who says different is simply not familiar with Ark
            And considering Ark already had poke balls for you dinosaurs it really isn't a big departure. But Ark was honestly pretty bad, Palworld feels like Ark but actually with some intelligent thought behind the design.
                and slavery as well.
                    My favorite
                    You can basically do that in Ark, it's just instead of making them work you force feed them poop as they waste away in a cage
                        that's torture not slavery, sir. Get your human rights violations in order.
                Also, it is designed more with 2 players or single players in mind. Vs ark, which is designed to be played with multiple players.
                    Dang.  Was hoping to co-op with my 3 friends.  Is it available to play this way at all?
                        You definitely can. It is up to 32 players with a dedicated server, and I think 4 with normal in game hosting.
                Ark, but it respects your time and I don’t have to clear acres of land just to get a decent level 1 base
                Probably the biggest advantage Palworld has over Ark (specifically for your gaming platform) is that Palworld is just under 7 gigabytes in size, compared to over a hundred for Ark (these sizes are from the Xbox versions, they might be different on steam).

The second biggest is that everything is adorable in Palworld.
                    I think Ark crosses the 200GB mark on PC with all dlcs. It’s a poorly coded game and absolutely massive.
                yeh ark was always about collecting/taming  "monsters" even without the pokeballs
            It’s just not as hardcore as ark either. I don’t have any gray hairs from playing this haha
            Ark has guns and people are saying it's Pokemon with guns and survival elements... Checks out to me
            To be fair, *waaaaaaaay* more people are going to be familiar with Pokemon than are even going to have ever heard of Ark. That's why
            Ark with Pokémon AND automation. The automation is the biggest part for me
            im glad that most are not familiar with that piece of garbage.
            Yes. This. I played Ark a LONG ass time ago, when it was still in the very beginning Early Access. 


Played Palworld last night, exactly the same but cuter and less clunky (remember my frame of reference was the very beginning of ARK)


I still enjoy it though, far more than Ark. (Plus install size is better, and it's not..built the way..however the fuck the ARK devs write their code lmfao)
        Ark already has Pokémon.

They're dinosaurs.
            You're getting downvoted, but you're effectively correct. From the large variety of creatures to having pocket sized dinosaur holding balls.
                Fire Wyvern used flamethrower. Enemy Dodo fainted.
                Those dinosaurs can't farm, mine, log, and build equipment and structures for me while I go catch more though, soooooooo.
                    Well, some can, but that's kind of moot because they can't do that in Pokemon either.
            And the 3d models in ark probably weren't stolen from 3d Pokémon games.

Considering what some people have shown.
            Ark has the horrible shitty breeding mini game system of Pokemon dialed up to 100000....

Cause it actually takes hours in real life to hatch an egg just too find out the IVs 🤣🤣🤣🤣
        The only pokemon game it’s similar too is Legends Arceus because of the incentive to capture multiples of the same pals but that’s about as far as the gameplay similarities go
            Arceus also has some bare bones gathering and crafting. The bosses in each are very similarly done too.
            Basically what I wanted Legends Arceus to be, except it went a little too far into the survival crafting mechanic. But I'm really enjoying it!
            You mean other than the overtly similar if not identical characters in terms of physiology. Only differences between colors used. lol
        I think the same thing, it's more of an Ark style game then Pokemon. Instead of dinosaurs you have the Pal's. You have the entire leveling system that is similar to Ark (unless it changed from when I used to play).  I haven't played Palworld but there is probably more similar things. 

It's Ark with cute monsters that you can make them automate (work) for you.
            Also quite importantly, Palworld feels far more casual friendly and I mean that in the best possible way. It's just far more forgiving and fun to the average player.
                I was tempted to buy it, not for the Pokemon (been a fan since 5 years old) feel but more because it gave me Ark vibes. I wanted to feel that first time playing Ark feeling again. Seeing a dodo for the first time and taming it but it being a Pal in this case.

But back to your point, it does feel and look more casual, that's why I was tempted to play it but then I got turned off with the real time egg hatching mechanics but then found out at a later date you can change these sorts of settings. Letting players change this will bring in a lot more casual play.
                    Yeah although those settings could use some work. For example, say you wanted to reduce  egg incubation times, they can be set to half at the 2nd lowest setting or have no incubation time at all iirc.
                    So Ive plopped about 8hrs into it, and while i have found a few eggs, I havent even gotten to the incubation part, but thats (so far) not a large part of collecting pals.   I think (I barely played it, and forever ago) Ark puts a massive amount of 'game time' into eggs / breeding that Palworld does not.
        yeah that’s just the media being its typical buzz word annoying ass. There’s a couple pals that have abilities with a cooldown that either use guns or the pal turns kinda into a gun but that’s a minor aspect to the game. The best part is hunting for pals that have better work suitability for your base
        Really looks like “Chibi ark” to me
        >Ark with Pokemon

Which was already a mod!
        Its super misleading.  Idk who came up with that shit.
        You could be on to something there.
        >People going in thinking it is more of a Pokemon game are being misled imo.

It was actually the developer who described it that way.  Which is a huge red flag for me.
        I dont think it helps that most of their promotional materials feature pals with guns over base progression and pal slavery. + Pokemon has penetrated the minds of gamers so much its hard to not immediately associate it with Pokemon over Ark. Open world sandbox isn't special, we have Ark, Minecraft, Valheim bit of Stardew Valley, Satisfactory, it's a saturated genre but tiny cute monsters in the wild? Thats pokemon
        "Pokemon with guns! You can have slaves!"

That shit needs to go away imo

 
I was entirely gonna skip it due to how cringe this sounds, but some of the recent clips and what not made me get it. I'm super thankful it isn't as crazy cringe as I thought it was going to be. Aside from the goofy catching/eating stuff. It's a great game that has a future
    It's *aesthetically* similar to pokemon, but the gameplay has nearly nothing in common.

Edit: y’all don’t seem to understand - “you catch monsters in balls” isn’t gameplay, it’s dressing around the gameplay. The actual gameplay of this game is 3rd person shooting with base building and crafting. I was told this is “Pokémon with guns” and was pretty disappointed to find it plays nothing like Pokémon (though I’m really enjoying the game anyway!)
        > but the gameplay has nearly nothing in common.

i mean... have you ever seen Pikachu holding a UZI in ash shoulder?

or have a birb shit explosive eggs.
            I've seen a plant shoot exploding eggs on pokemon, does that count?
            Bombirdier is a thing now. But it's a stork dropping stuff from its beak rather than shitting.
        Comparing palworld with pokemon because "you have balls and catch monsters" is like comparing palworld with doom. "you have guns and shoot monsters"
            What other games use balls to catch monsters?
                How does it matter? Temten with cards to catch monsters is more like pokemon then palworld with balls. Thats the point.
                    well temtem is a clone of pokemon (and a mediocre one at best), this takes an aspect of pokemon, that other games, including ark, took when enough years passed to get away with it.

while also almost certainly taking pokemon assets and morphing and mixing them into new shapes and definitely taking pokemon textures and slapping those onto new models (which in turn are at times also taken from other places, like the totoro one).

they didnt just copy the design philosophy and gave it their own spin.
                        \> they didnt just copy the design philosophy and gave it their own spin.

Right, its just an additional game mechanic introduced to valheim philosophy. thats the point. The pokemon (maingames) philosophy has much more then just catching funny monsters with balls. everything besides that is missing.

idk whenever i read people comparing it to a pokemon game it feels like they never played a pokemon game before. Its confusing.
                    Because saying the comparison isn’t valid while it’s literally the only game with that exact system makes it a fair comparison to say it’s like Pokémon mixed with arc. It’s not as simple as “doom shoots monsters” when there’s literally thousands of games that shoot monsters but like 1 that captures monsters in balls n shit lol
            but its more like mario land, you can jump !
        Yeah. I mean, sure, you have to fight to weaken cute animal-like monst... creatures, and throw a ball at them to catch... sorry, *capture* them. And then you carry them around in your pocket. Then you can rename them, and teach them more abilities. For some, you have to use even more advanced capture balls. And you have to capture very specific types in order to perform very specific tasks, like riding them, or putting out fires.




*Gotta capture all of them!*
            They're probably talking about how main line pokemon games feature turn based combat with a strength and weakness system
                The creatures and moves have types. So far, I've seen normal, dark, grass, and dragon in the first 3 hours.
            Again - lots of surface-level similarities. But the actual moment to moment gameplay is nothing like traditional turn-based Pokémon. 
        You catch monsters in balls evel them up and fight them. That's a fairly big similarity. But yeah they've also tacked on the survival aspects. 

Very addictive combo if you ask me.
            Maybe I didn't play long enough, but your comparison is pretty shallow. Yes, you collect monsters and fight them. But it's mostly you doing the fighting while your pet autoattacks randomly. I didn't see any way to command the pet or teach it specific things. It levels up by doing non combat shit like chopping trees at your base.

The core of the combat is in no way similar to the turn based combat from the Pokémon franchise.
                >But it's mostly you doing the fighting while your pet autoattacks randomly.

Except they deal significantly more damage and are better at fighting than you.

Even thugs if you capture them 

>I didn't see any way to command the pet or teach it specific things

What are you talking about 
There are literally skill fruits that work JUST like TMs do

>It levels up by doing non combat shit like chopping trees at your base.

You mean....like PLA did when you were doing things like gathering and stealth catching awarding relatively minor amounts of exp? 

>The core of the combat is in no way similar to the turn based combat from the Pokémon franchise.

Pst, pokemon SV literally has an auto battle function, which while not going through individual attacks like PW, is the same basic thing.
                    I'll have to take your word for it. I played the game 30 minutes and uninstalled. 

I like the turn based combat of Pokémon, and I have zero interest in base building, survival, and crafting mechanics. 

It's just not a game for me.
                        a moment of silence for the men and women who got scammed by everybody saying "its pokemon with guns" 

RIP your 30$ friend
                It's not "exactly" the same but its pretty damn similar. And yes you can teach moves and command them, but it's not turn based. That's the difference. Iirc some of the more recent Pokémon games have ditched the turned based combat as well...
                    Pokémon is turn based, none of the recent games have removed that. At most Legends: Arceus had a slightly modified turn order (not strict 1 turn per Pokémon, it depended on speed), but it was still turn based. 

And the Pals in Palworld aren’t able to be controlled beyond picking skills or using specific active skills (like turning Foxparks into a flamethrower that the player wields). Palworld is definitely more of a normal action combat game than it is Pokémon.
                        Well if you are on a mount you get full control over the pal's moves but I get your point. 

Aside from the battling though, collecting the pals, levelling them up, etc it's got a lot in common with Pokémon. I would even argue this is closer to where Pokémon should be these days if game freak weren't so hell bent on holding it back.
                            Moving away from turned-based would be a big FU to the competitive scene.
                                Their recent work has been a big FU to the entire scene over and over again for decades really though hasn't it.

Edit: downvoted eh. We just gonna act like the Pokémon games are good these days? Lol
                                    I've enjoyed VGC in this gen significantly more than the last one, probably more than gen 6 as well.
    From what I gather it's basically Ark with Pokémon instead of Dinos and Fortnight aesthetic.
    I agree I dont think there's anything wrong with it. 

What I will say, is that all these type of base building survival games have a particular aesthetic that makes them look janky compared to a standard shooter etc. 

I just assume it's the nature of making this type of game because I'm yet to see one that doesn't.
        Yeah it kinda reminded me of Fortnite...
    Pal pathing is really janky. I'm getting tired of my pals in base getting hungry/injured/knocked out cus they randomly stuck behind my walls or on top of some structure. It happens all the time, more and bigger pals you get, the worse it is.

And you start building stuff in your base more and more, their pathing gets really weird and they start doing some back and forward movement when they cant find a path. Even tho there is decent gaps they just dont want to go through that and instead travel around the world to get to the point.

Also pals following me randomly get stuck or just stop and stare into nothingness for no reason. 

And im trying to capture a pal, but it fails so it "flies" inside a cliff or anything that is nearby and gets stuck.

Also perma combat is a thing..


But its still a good game, definiately has janky bugs.
        The pal pathing is so bad, I started building a second base in a big flat patch just to try and give my pals a place they can actually get around in.  My first base is on a hill and it breaks their brains
        Ai in general is pretty bad tbh
    Definetly not rust but Ark yes
        > Definetly not rust

I imagine that one big difference is fewer nakeds, lol.
            😂 yes thankfully 
    I'm glad to see reasonable and grounded answers at the top here. On Twitter it is insane how many Pokeman fans with fucking Stockholm syndrome are down right frothing at the mouth that this game has been so successful lol. Literally grasping at the most hilarious straws and wild claims that this game violates copyright laws to find any flaws with it, as if Game Freak games are the pinnacle of fine craftsmanship hahahahaha....
        the last good pokemon game was black/white maybe with this gamefreaks can finally shut off auto pilot mode but I doubt it less effort means more money.
        Hopefully, this game will be the end of Gamefreak.
            >Hopefully, this game will be the end of Gamefreak.

PW while fun isn't pokemon.


Not will it even scratch the paint of pokemon's success or sales 

Pokemon SV was pretty widely assumed it was going to be trash due to all the problems with PLA and SWSH, it still sold 23.23 million copies
            If you honestly think that, you don’t really understand just how much Pokémon games sell.
    My son described it as Pokémon Ark! Sounds awesome.
    Unsure what conclusion you're drawing here but Ark and rust are extremely successful titles, so... palworld good?
    The bugs are hilarious. You can fly by standing on a capture sphere. The human enemies are coded like Pals so you can catch them. If I pick up my sheep and put him down in certain places he glitches through the ground.
        humans being caught is not a bug, though.
    >I don't think the game is very janky, it felt fine to me.

There is definitely jank in how the pals operate in battle and inside the base. I've had pals just sit there and get killed by other pals without fighting back or pals that simply refuse to go eat out of a full food box and starve to death.
    I would say it's like Ark, Valheim and Pokemon had a baby
        Replace Valheim with fortnite and zelda and you would be spot on.
    Everyone heard "Pokémon with guns" and lost their mind when it's really just another lame survival/base builder game with a really lame pet gimmick laid on top.
        I mean it’s still pretty fun, I’m assuming you haven’t touched it because it goes pretty in depth. If people weren’t having fun it wouldn’t be selling this much, considering from what I’ve seen the majority didn’t even know it was coming, they just heard about it after it launched and blew up fast. My little brother saw it and wish-listed it on Steam almost 2 years ago now lol
    Would you say that there is more or less jank than in ark ?
        Compared to when vanilla ark released, Palworld is amazing. But given how much content and development and mods have added to ark, Palworld isn’t close yet.
    Also isn’t the game in early access? Obviously that isn’t an excuse if the game was literally unplayable with loads of bugs but that isn’t the case from what I’ve played.
        It is early access.

It literally is an excuse.

It is week 1 of early access.
I think it’s going to stay healthy but it’s crazy popularity will probably fizzle in about two to three weeks.
    14 days from this comment, there will be a slew of "gaming journalists" writing a post to meet the deadline with a title like "Palworld has lost 90% of its audience"

This clickbait title gets engagement from those that dislike the game, and those who want to defend the game. Thing is, 10% of 1 million is 100K, which is still very respectable numbers, but yet the click-starved journalist looking to keep their job will write the article all the same.
        Yea. There’s almost no way any game can retain this high a player base. Everyone is curious and trying it out because of the hype. Which is great. and if the devs can maintain it and improve it where it needs improvement then it will be a long lasting healthy game.

And yes. It will lose the vast majority of its players and people will point at the big numbers and act like it’s a big deal and some kind of failure.

But in reality a game that gains 50,000 players from the start and maintains 90% of its player base is a success.
A game that gains 1 million from the start and loses 90% of its players is a much bigger success.

BUT it gets painted as a failure because people don’t understand numbers and journalists capitalize on ignorance.
            Unless the devs are working quickly, it's unlikely Palworld will see more than a bugfix in the next few weeks. It doesn't have a very in-depth story. It doesn't have the rush of PvP. Unlike live-service games, the pals don't need to be fed. You can leave forever and come back eventually. And that's what people are going to do. Like No Man's Sky, the devs can boost their sales with future expansions later this year, but in-between, the numbers will dive as the novelty wears off and the annoyances stack up. Nothing new.
                The strange expectations for a non online service game to maintain its population is the crazier thing.
                    Yep, the obsession with steam numbers on a non always-online live service game is tiring. Not to mention that Palworld will have a dedicated modding scene since Pokemon modding has been on overdrive since the 2010s. Apparently there's already a Pokemon overhaul mod.
                        Holy, you opened eyes, if this game get good a good modding scene it may live forever.


Like, just new Mod pals would already be big


There's a gold mine here
                            New mod pals plus modders can go ham with whatever they want to add since Palworld itself isn't restricted to one genre unlike other games. For all we know there's mods expanding pal combat while there are mods expanding the fps mechanic or mods expanding the automation side while all looking good. That's the great positive of using a modern engine like Unreal Engine 5.

And it's funny that there's already a [Pokemon replacement mod](https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1749381513001767167)  , so if they can do that what's stopping them from adding gym/elite 4 npcs and you get to fight their pokemons in real time at the towers instead of being static like the mainline games.

Ideas so good I can feel the copyright strikes even before it's publicly released. That's how this game lives on even if devs abandon it.
                                Add full modsupport and they will sell 10mill

There would be full pokemon mods within a week
        That's exactly how many people play BG3 on average now. Journalists who would choose this POV would be fooling themselves.
        Player count is absolutely meaningless. I've played niche online shooters with a player count of around 100 and I had no trouble finding full matches.
            Player count matters when you expect content and updates. Game has to make money to get developed.
            Weird take.
        Game loses 1 player (dude actually went to sleep) every youtuber and gaming journalist: PALWOLRD IS DEAD
        "this startling trend"
            # Avid film critic watches Goodfellas 10 times, then doesn't watch it for 2 years. Are critics getting burned out of gangster movies?

Comments (133)

* Yeah Goodfellas had some great commentary on second-generation working-class Italians looking to stake their claim in America, but it did feel a little choppy.
   * And as much as I loved the film on release, the blood effects look dated after 30 years.
      * Are you joking dude? When \[major spoiler\] gets shot in the head it was so realistic compared to the CGI crap we have today.
   * The ending felt rushed. Couldn't the script writers have worked longer before they released it?
* I love gangster movies and will buy the steelbook as soon as it goes on sale.
* Unpopular opinion: after 80 years of gangster movies, I'm kind of over them.
   * Agreed. Can we get some more superhero films? I remember back in the day those were so fun to watch. Great times.
      * bro the Dark Knight in theaters was wildddd
      * Ew, gross.
   * no youre good, I feel alot of the same way. Bang BANG rob steal woop de doo...
   * Another "unpopular opinion" that is actually popular.
* Goodfellas made 47 million in the box office which is way less than I thought. Seems like people were burned out of gangster movies back then too.
   * i can see why. it was going up against Ghost which is an objectively better story.
      * The theater went wild for \[major spoiler\]. Like who would choose some boring shoot 'em up over that?
      * "Ghost" was peak. I remember playing that so many times on my dad's VCR. I didn't even understand it!
   * You're crazy. Adjusted for inflation that's almost $111,000,000 today which is *very* good for its time. y'all are just hating.
* Playing this kind of post-WWII drama was important for my childhood.
   * Did you know that Hitler influenced a joke in one scene? \[40 minute YouTube Video\]
   * ya man, what's the dislike? They don't make movies like they used to.

Yadda yadda, same old stuff, it writes itself.
                LOL .... goodfellas is one of the few movies - along with pulp fiction and a few others that I would always watch if I hit on it while channel surfing.

[edikt: numerous spelling fixes]
        Yup, this is the sad state of the video game world online. People who like a game just quietly keep playing it but people who dislike it, especially a popular one, want validation for their dislike and seek that out and that’s who articles get written for. It’s so fucking negative and it really makes me feel gross
    Once they bring in Workshop/Mod support, the game will resurge for a while, but that's not on the map till after launch from what I've read. But at least it's been mentioned. I'm hoping the devs don't do what they've done to Craftopia (slow small updates, not much content added from what I've been told by friends who have played it). I'm hoping the 3mil+ copies sold will be able to keep them working on the game for a couple years seriously instead of having the focus shifted to whatever the next project is.
        Honestly the devs could do nothing but add steam workshop support and the game would be thriving in a year
    Yah there just isn't enough content. Everything is very basic right now. I think it will fizzle in a few weeks followed by a resurgence as they hopefully release new content. More pals. More bosses. More base building designs. 

I think it's up to the developer how far they want the game to go. They could probably take their bag and leave if they wanted.
    TBF, that's pretty much every game though. Players the following month is always significantly lower than the players on release.
    I'll take a bet on that and say there wont be a decline in 3 weeks, I'll bet on a steady growth for at least the next 4 months.

Bet?
        I would but I don’t really care.
            Neither do I but was curious to see who'd call it.
You really shouldn't be going in expecting a Pokemon game. Despite the advertising, it's actually more a survival game than a traditional Creature-Capture game. ARK is the main comparison, and for good reason. 

&#x200B;

As for the game itself, yeah, I'd say it's pretty good. More polished than most Early Access titles; which isn't saying a lot admittedly. And the Creature Capture mechanics blend *astonishingly* well with the survival and base building elements. Overall, I'm definitly interested to see where the game goes.

&#x200B;

If you're looking for something closer to an actual pokemon game though, I'd recommend looking towards Temtem, Cassette Beasts, Coromon, or Nexomon: Extinction, in that order.
    > Temtem

Microtransactions awaaaaay! At least Palworld is a $30 game you get for $30, forever.
        Temtem shot itself by trying to be an MMO without offering enough of a draw to be able to maintain a player base.
            Temtem shot itself by making the game annoying to play so they could sell convenience in the cash shop.
                I mean that's exactly what I said. The grind that can be skipped with microtransactions is the most MMO thing. 

And honestly they could have skipped that. By giving it MMO aspects they basically increased their own running costs as it meant they had to maintain servers for running the game. If they had just kept it as a modest pokemon clone they wouldn't need to try and do battle passes.
                    It could have still been massively multiplayer. A Pokémon clone with a persistent overworld and some pvp / co-op elements seemed to be what they were going for. But MMOs don't inherently need to be evil, they just benefit a lot from it.

Personally I think the private server route is better for games like this and Minecraft.
                    That is just straight up wrong. Microtransactions don't give you any game advantages or "skip the grind" as you called it. They are purely cosmetic.
        Temtem has left a bad taste in my mouth ever since r/theperfectpokemongame would not stop talking about it. I am certain that a significant number of posts about that game were posted by the developers. It does not surprise me at all that it's full of microtransactions. 

The "perfect Pokemon game" at a minimum should have Pokemon in it. If it's not got Pokemon, it's not a Pokemon game.  

That said, Palworld is a great *creature collecting game* and I'm enjoying it more than any of the recent releases from Pokemon! I just wish Gamefreak would release something that is closer to this so that I can enjoy the Pokemon IP again.
        > At least Palworld is a $30 game you get for $30, forever.

Awfully confident that they won't add micro-transactions down the road. Wouldn't be the first time.
            Ah true, they could add crap later. I doubt they'd add a cosmetics/convenience store though, because the game has self hosted server infrastructure and custom settings for difficulty (and locally stored saves). You can't sell people cheat codes like EXP boosters when they could just hex-edit a locally saved file or play the game with "exp rate" set to 20x.

Most likely, there'd be paid DLC. Worst case, there's paid cosmetics (which would absolutely be a cash grab and betrayal of the audience).
                Ark added paid dlc expansions before releasing the original game out of early access lol

How did the developers previous game go?


Edit - just checked. Still in early access.
    >Cassette Beasts

Cassette beasts is the clear king of the genre right now in my mind. It definitely recaptured the magic for me without being a straight derivative and I was surprised how much I liked the writing and creature designs.

Plus that soundtrack. Good lord.
        Yeah I'm super surprised Cassette Beasts didn't even get a fraction of the Pokemon community hype Palworld is getting.

It's way closer to pokemon than Palworld while still feeling fresh and unique (plus, the designs are unique and not reused pokemon assets like palworld lol).
    I like to think the game is a more immersive version of what the Pokemon world would of been like before any of the towns and routes were developed, plus guns and some high tech stuff.
        It looks to me like if Legends: Arceus was more than a tech demo

In the show Pokémon help build things right? Makes sense you'd have them working in a small town etc
    I also recommend Cassette Beasts, fantastic game
    I compare it more to age of Conan. A slave is a slave, whether I raided a town for them or threw a pokimans balls at them.
    Cassette beasts is amazing and even had a built in randomizer, although I wouldn’t recommend it for a first playthrough as it’s incredibly unbalanced
If you like the gameplay loop of Ark and Pokémon you'll like it at least for a while, there's a little jank but its all completely playable. This isn't exactly the place to ask though, every person in this subreddit has been inhaling mass amounts of copium and loses their shit every time this game is even mentioned.
    Is it the good part of ark? Or the ones like grinding tons of hours for a door
        [deleted]
            Basic materials like wood and stone are plentiful yeah, but I feel like crafting ammo or anything else that requires ingots gets very grindy. Doesn't help that it's so heavy that you keep having to run home and drop the ore off so often.
                True. What helps is a second base at an iron spot and let pals do the work of gathering that stuff into a chest next to your palbox. Pick up all, teleport to main Base, unpack into chest next to your palbox there. Done.
                    Yup. You unlock the second base just in time to start needing tons of iron. It's pretty clear they intended it to be a mining base.
                        And the pals doing work for you, somebody definitely got tired of having to do everything themselves in ark.
                            I haven't played ark but i could understand that from other survival games. The automation is so nice to have.
                                I especially love how organic it is. No need to micromanage. The pals can be specifically instructed, or left to their own devices, and they get shit *done*.
                                    Except the fuckin penguin and fox keep leaving their posts. I NEED THAT FRIDGE COLD AND MY INGOTS HOT DAMMIT WHY DID YOU TELEPORT ONTO THE BATTLEMENT
                        And you get a third base the moment you start to get the next ingot, so yeah, secondary bases are meant to be gathering.
                        Oh thank god I was wondering how I was going to manage ore
                        Can your bases get raided while you are not there?  
Will walls help or does the enemy just destroy them?  
what do sand bags actually do?
                    It's actually worth smelting it in the same place you farm it and then just move the ingots (as they weigh less and you get more space for crafting in your main base). 4 pals with level 3 mining can get more than 8 deposits before they respawn. So there is plenty of space for 2 carriers and two/three smelters.
                        This guy palworlds!
                            Or Factorio'es. Or Satisfactories.
                    Yep, and I already have 2 or 3 spots marked on my map as candidates for the second base for iron.
                    What I really loved in Pal World that they did, and most times I would need a mod for such features is:

1) Being able to teleport/fast travel while over encumbered (while still being able to move)

2) Crafting stations take resources from chests.

I always assumed I would need the resources on me to craft, like so many other games. Didnt realize until later that it pulled resources from chests within the base boundary. I'm sure other games have done this, but just from the few that i've played it always require resources on your character.

I'm only about 7hrs in, playing solo and absolutely loving the game so far.
                    Am I missing something? I built a base right among a bunch of iron and put some depressos down but they’re not touching them. Can’t figure it out.
                There are a fair number of spots with 4+ ore spots around. Once you unlock a second base, build one there and fill it up with Pals with the Mining lvl. 2+ ability, a few pals with transporting and some basic food production. The only chest should be built right next to the pal station.  
The mining pals will continuously mine the ore while the transporters gather it in the chest. Every once in a while you can teleport there, grab the ore and teleport back to your main base. Doesn't matter if you can't move with all the ore, as teleporting is still possible and in your base you can leapfrog the ore by dropping it, moving towards the closest chest and picking it up again.
                The weight is mostly why putting most of your level points into weight is the way to go. Not really a reason to use the points on attack since it increases it by like 2 and your digimons are usually the ones doing the damage
                    Or you could just make a grappling hook.

No matter how over encumbered you are you can always use the grappling hook so its easy to move around huge amounts of stuff via your palbox teleport.
                    You could use pals with weight increase passive for carrying(starting spots cats have it). I put like 3-4 points into carry weight but I feel like stamina and hp are better investment of points.
                I built my second run base literally in an area with like ten iron deposits in a ring, way up on a mountain too so I can glide to wherever.

Best decision as wood/stone I can generate infinite of, if my fucking foxpark would stop being fucking lazy I'm easily hitting like a thousand ingots in barely any time. Sucks he's bugged out but has the slacker debuff.

I purposefully got two miner skill and two logging skills to give me resources so I usually have a few hundred when I come back + my game bugged out really hard so I have six pals at my base doing everything but they're not actually at my base and don't lose hunger/motivation at all. They're just churning out resources like crazy and taking the occasional break.

Then I have my regular pals that I can actually interact with and they're churning out other stuff.

Plus my mate made a big house but he doesn't know if you crawl up a wall until you hit the ceiling you teleport into the room above you. I've been stealing shit from his locked house to fuck with him for the last two days and then escaping out the roof because he built a big overhang into his second floor.
        People played ark without tuning the numbers?
            Ark looked like a second job to me
                That's because ARK IS a second job. 

We had a group of friends all playing together, had a nice base, a bunch of nice dinosaurs, good gear, a nice farm, everything. 

We had all played hard this day, did a lot of work caught a bunch of dinos and everything, what one could call a hard days day of work. So at some point we call it a night and we all crawl into our beds, dead tired from the hard work of the day, well almost all of us. The one player that loved the farming stayed around, she's going around taking care of the farms and grabbing eggs. Thirty minutes-an hour go by and she starts hearing noises outside the base, she goes and checks it out and notices a few players sneaking around our base, she soon finds out that they are raiders, CHINESE RAIDERS! So she being outnumbered and the least PvP confident and least PvP experience player in our group panicks. She jumps on discord voice calling everyone to try to get some help (I think it might have been Skype at the time.), but no help is coming as everyone else is sleeping from their hard day of play/work. So she ends up just hiding there and watching this group of raiders destroy our base and kill our dinos.

6-8-10 hours later as the rest of the group wakes up, they notice the dozens of panicked calls for help, they all quickly jump on the game to witness the aftermath of the devastation with their own eyes and is baaad. There are a few dinos that are somehow still alive, maybe they were set to passive or something and the raiders didn't feel like wasting time killing them, but these are the lower level ones or ones without great stats, used for eggs or manure. Apart from these not good dinos a couple of walls here and there and a few boxes with stone or wood, everything else is gone.

So what is the point of this story? Well I guess you aren't allowed to have any off time from the game and if you do dare to take some time off you better have someone to stay and guard around the clock AND make sure everyone is reachable on their phone at all times so you can come in for emergency wor..I mean play during the weekends.
                    That sounds miserable
            Literally that, it looks so awful to play it without atleast x10 loot and honestly i prefer even higher
            there are people that actually play ark on official servers where it has the default config...

Some people are really masochist in playing a survival game where GRIND is really fucking slow.
        That's the best part Pokemon sweatshops, they'll do all the work for you!
        The good parts.

There's a grind, but its minutes instead of hours.

The pals can actually do a lot of the grinding for you with the right upgrades. Automation back at base grinding up basic resources and crafting stuff like ammo while you go do the fun part.

Big pal eggs take a couple hours to hatch in an incubator, but you aint waiting *days* to only have a baby starve to death because your maewing decided "nah fuck this one".

Its rough, but its a *great* start. Lots of promise.
            What I get from Palworld is that the base, the core, it's already built, there's a solid great stuff here with this direction.


They just need to improve it


 But as a early access, this sold the idea really well 
                From early looks its one of the most complete gameplay experiences that has entered "early access" in recent memory.
        Grind can become almost non-existent fairly early on since you can automate practically everything with Pals
            The power of outsourcing labour
        I tried out Palworld, it wasn't for me but it did have world setting options where you could jack up the material drop rates to insane degrees so that instead of hitting a tree for 45 seconds it was like, two punches to make a workbench. There are a *lot* of options to customize how much "grind" the game has.

Edit: a friend bought me the game as a gift after I refunded it. It hooked me this time. No regrets
        Ark with the bad bits thrown out. 
You get plenty of resources from the trees/rocks and the basic buildings require a totally reasonable amount of wood/stone i.e hit a tree once or twice and you can make a wall instead of needing the entire tree
        The grind is nowhere near ark levels. Plus your little pals can do some of the grinding for you passively.
        The nice part is that crafting can be automated so not as grindy as ark
    I liked the idea of ark but my 2fps and 30min timer till crash made me not like it.
        And also the 250gb storage usage
    If I've never even heard of Ark until now but loved pokemon as a kid, I'm still tempted to go in blind.

Should I look up Ark gameplay to fill in this puzzle piece or are there many types of Ark gameplay?
        The Ark part is very important  
Because this game is nothing like Pokemon  
Whereas Pokemon is a JRPG through and through, Palworld is a crafting focused survival game  
They're not even the same genre of game
        Nah, once you work out the controls it explains it fine. Catch Pals, level up, unlock things in your skill tree, repeat.

Pretty fun loop actually, I was shocked by it.
            The fun part is leveling is tied to capturing pals so you only worry about the part of making balls on your Chinese Sweatshop.

so you will still have some use for those pals that you ~~enslave~~ capture.
        Ark is extremely grindy. Like "my breeding is done in 6 hours and I need to be on in 6 hours or i wasted 26 hours" type shit. 

Palworld is grindy but more enjoyable in my opinion. Like others said, there's jank but it's a lot more fun. As for the pokemon aspect it's more like acreus than pokemon white. 

Rarely will you be thinking "what do I do now?" You have a clear set of goals through a majority and as soon as you load into the game it's mechanics are clear. Being honest it does a pretty good job of teaching you everything.

And remember you get 2 hours to play, you can just refund if you don't like it. I'm quite a bit of hours in and I find it extremely enjoyable, lots to do , lore , good flair for attacks.
            I'd like to add that Ark is only that grindy if you play on the official settings/servers, which isn't recommended by most players from my experience, unofficial servers and solo play offer a lot more reasonable grind rates.
                I've always avoided Ark because it seems too daunting. Is solo ark reasonable to do and enjoy (with said changed settings)? I've endured solo Valheim and loved it solo.
                    Its not bad, but the big problem with Ark is the performance and file size optimization. Last I checked the whole install with DLC is well over 200GB, I had to manually run some windows file compacter tool to bring it down by more than half, and there was no performance impact from that.
                    Solo or multi is not the real problem, pve is, last time i played the game it was absolutely not designed or balanced for it, its fine early on, but when it gets bad it does so extremely fast, it also has tons of time wasting, time sensitive mechanics designed to keep you online, its not quite as bad on singleplayer but they are still there.
                Not to mention you can re-tune the values everytime you join the game you created (well, solo anyway). So no worries if you over or undertuned some values (looking at you V Rising).
            Gamespass would be the better trial imo cause then you get the catalog of everything else you can play for the month if not (plus intro price of like $1) yes am aware is behind the steam version but update is planned from what I've heard and I haven't had any issues with it yet
                Highly recommend this approach for people who aren't familiar with this type of game and assume this is just like Pokemon  
I tested it last night on Game Pass and decided the survival nature of it is just not for me
                    You can tweak that as well down to like 0 or almost 0 which should help some but yea enough not like Pokemon that don't think it's just Pokemon
        I enjoyed Ark by heavily adjusting settings, I don't have time to play on official servers with legit settings. I hosted a server for a few friends, where we cranked the settings in our favour and it was a lot of fun.

I've wanted to try single player, but it doesn't seem as interesting for me anyways.

I think Ark is okay to go in blind, but you'll definitely be Googling some wikis as you go along.
    This is the kind of jank that makes the game funner. I do think it’ll die down a bit, but the players who stop will have most likely already sunk 30 or 40 hours into the game so is it a really a failure? That much gameplay for something priced so low. From then on there will be waves of players returning everytime we get an update
    What’s the gameplay loop of Ark?
        Grind > Die > Grind > Die
    I guess you could say it's....palatable
    Inhaling copium = people are very excited about a new game they enjoy and want to share their positivity about it
        No he meant the opposite, the people who think the game is only popular now because of the hype and will die in early access once the hype is gone
            Ah I see I see, I actually purchased it after I made that comment and just played for about 5 hours straight with a friend, was not expecting to enjoy it that much
Playing it with my kids, we are having a blast. They enjoy the base building and the real time battles while trying to act quick enough to capture the pals. 

We had a bug where my daughter was somehow on a pal sphere I threw and it launched her into orbit. We laughed, my son revived her. The art style is no worse than current gen pokemon.

Edit - Daughter 9, Son 7
    That's a glitch that I've seen used to travel large distances
        You can also one shot bosses with it if you time it right
            What is it, throwing one when they are too high hp to be caught?
    How old are your kids? Looking for a new game to play with my 7yo daughter.
        There’s guns and violence, but no blood/gore. There are some things like the pals crying when you’re fighting them, or if you treat them poorly in your base that a child may find disturbing. There’s also paldeck/Pokédex descriptions that describe certain pals being used for execution.
            Well, there's also the Butcher's Knife item that lets you butcher Pals that you've caught. My 9-year-old can't decide if he finds that disturbing or hilarious, but that's kind of the human condition, I guess. Nothing else in the game is nearly that disturbing, but it's a great platform for talking to your kids about how we treat animals in the real world, for better or worse.

edit: You can also capture "bad guys" and use them for your bidding, which is a little weird and might also be a bit unsettling depending. I feel like 7 is old enough to understand most of what's going on, but you might need to talk them through some things occasionally.
                > My 9-year-old can't decide if he finds that disturbing or hilarious

I'm 31 and same
                Just a heads-up, though you're unlikely to try yourself, uless you're really curious. You can butcher anything in a pal sphere, and anything in A pal sphere is considered a pal.


 Ergo you can use the butcher knife in humans, so avoid that lol
                    I wondered. Thank you for filling in that gap in my knowledge. xD
            Honestly, it's about as violent as Fortnite. If you think that's not appropriate for your kids, then this isn't either.
                It's weird. Having kids has made me way less judgmental toward other parents about almost everything, but as a game enjoyer, I am incredibly vigilant about my son's games and am surprised at what other parents allow.

It's not like my parents who didn't really understand games and ended up not doing much about it (basically the era that birthed the ESRB). 

Rather, I know exactly how addictive games can be and how much time (and ambition) they can suck up. I want him to enjoy games that enable his creativity and abilities, rather than stifling them. 

And that's not even addressing the content discussion. I saw what happened when our nephew was allowed to play games like Call of Duty at 5 or 6. The poor kid is a desensitized drone, and I think it's in no small part due to his mom allowing completely unmonitored/unrestricted gaming time. 

To be clear, I think this aspect is a symptom of their greater (lack of) parenting issues, but he's also never been given the privilege of getting to know who he is without a game to sink hours into.

Sorry. I don't know what about your comment sparked my gaming dad soapbox moment, but I hope somebody got something out of it.
            Also y'know, the human slavery. And the 69th entry in the paldex (edit:  legitimately they made a pal whose thing is "it has breasts and wants to make love with everything" and made it number 69)
                Important to note that this specific Pal was actually going to be a different number at first, 49 I've heard. They changed it because of a suggestion for it to be 69 on their discord, which makes them good devs who have spent time listening to fans somewhat.
                    >  which makes them good devs who have spent time listening to fans somewhat.

I can't work out if this is sarcastic as hearing this aspect just made me groan in annoyance even harder that the devs chose to cater to people who need to touch grass.
        The writing tries kinda hard to have an edge to it, but I don't think its so bad you wouldn't let her play it. The only real problem is that edginess extends to the pal descriptions in the Paldeck where they describe the Pals ripping the skin off in public executions or non-consensually mating with humans.
            One of the first Pals has a description that says it's got the mental capacity of a human 5 to 7 year old, which is great up until they started figuring out how to use weapons and killed their trainers.
        My Pal called Depresso was hungry and the in game text said "*the lazy bastard is sleepy*". 

Gameplay is fine for kids but there is stuff like the above text in it.

In Europe its pending PEGI 12 (12 and above ages). In the US I would say it will be 16 and above as US ratings tend to be more strict when it comes to bad language vs Europe where ages 12 and up are fine for bad language and its only 16 and up if the language is sexual or very in your face / over the top.
        Depends, are you in America? 7 yo is good to go on wholesome gun blasting goodness!

Before the NRA sicks their bots on me, seriously just taking the piss lol.
Is it janky? Yes. Needs improvement? Yes. However does not look like if AI was trying to make a game. It is simply early access game. Similar to a previous product from same developer. However it has the niche appeal many games did not scratch but as you correctly seen it is game in "early access".

It is game carried by being something pokemon does not want to be and has multiplayer. It is enough. People outside of X and reddit bubbles just want to have fun with friends and that is giving them exactly it.
    "AI" is now just a generic buzzword like "smart" or "2.0". Marketing firms are using it for everything that utilizes a computer or some form of learning algorithm. Redditors use it to mean "thing I dislike/thing that looks unoriginal".
        When I hear the word AI, I imagine something uninspired lacking cohesion (lacking soul), not what you said. But might be the case of different people, different meanings.
            Problem is AI should not be associated with that. All games with NPCs use some sort of AI but not generative AI.
    The AI argument is about the Pal designs as some straight up are mish mashes of existing Pokemon.
        I think we have already other existing games ripping of Pokemon, Pokemon ripped of also other ips and tbh they went lazy with many new designs. What I'm trying to say is it is not enough to put Palworld guys in court most likely.
Coming from someone that doesn't play games like Ark or Rust but I've played a ton of pokemon. 

The gameplay loop is satisfying, learning and getting rewarded for learning something are well paced and keep things interesting.

Definitely some jank and areas need work like animations and AI.

But it's a solid foundation that doesn't ask you to constantly pay for something new, and I think thats what people are really enjoying about this game if you break it down.
One of the better survival games I have played. Don't know what all these people are talking about that it is janky? Runs and looks better than Ark Survival Evolved did when I bought that game like 5 years after it was released. But anyway so far it is pretty cool. I built a big base all the Pals go around working in your base while you are away the chest inventory is shared with your crafting stations which I appreciate. Also just unlocked a grappling hook and I have been riding around on my Lama Pal and flying around with my Bird pal. Game is good so far atleast in single player. I haven't tried multiplayer yet.
    The janky would be the unrefined systems and control implementations. The game bugs out often while trying to set pals to work is probably the biggest complaint but overall I agree that it packs a lot, for how new the game is, compared to early Ark maps.
        It's also in early access, which many people seem to be forgetting who've shamed this game for having bugs. It has less bugs than some full release games, including Pokémon Scarlet/Violet.
            Man I remember playing Scarlet on release and didn’t have a single bug, not even the memory leak. The game was just hella unoptimized tho. So far palworld is the first paid Early Access game that has felt good to me, but I’ve also just played a lot of shitty early access titles lmao
        fair enough,  yea I got hit through the bottom of the world once and my pals have gotten stuck at the base but usually sort themselves out. Plus one of the pal skills caused my character to sink into the world. But overall I would say it really aint that janky.
    >Don't know what all these people are talking about that it is janky?

The Pokemon fanatics with Stockholm syndrome are fucking losing their minds grasping at straws to find any flaws with this game because they are so bizarrely jealous of its viral success. This is what happens when you make inanimate objects and concepts like corporate franchises your entire personality.
        I was wondering the same thing. I have noticed in the past on here that a lot of people crusade for different franchises or really anything they are interested in despite the reality of things. So I thought this may be a similar situation. I grew up with Pokemon and somewhat like the survival genre so I am happy to have something like this come out and do it pretty damn well.
            I can't agree more, and I'm not even really interested in the game! It just makes me happy to see more options and interesting ideas out there.
        i dont even like pokemon and i have many issues with this game.  there are game breaking bugs and its annoying.  but hopefully with some time they are fixed.  good game
        >This is what happens when you make inanimate objects and concepts like corporate franchises your entire personality.


The irony of getting of super defensive about a game and then ending it with this lmao.
            Doing something you said you don’t like (and they weren’t even lmao) is definitely irony, you’re very good at using that word and you should keep doing it
        You really are telling yourself the only people that might criticize the game are Pokemon fans losing their minds out of jealousy, then say they’re the ones too attached to a game?
    >One of the better survival games I have played. 


Ive heard this line at least 50 times from friends and coworkers whenever they're trying to get me interested in the new early access turd that just dropped. Palworld won't be any different.
    There’s plenty of janky camera stuff if you’re trying to interact with something close and above you (e.g. whittling down Nitewing health in melee), assigning specific tasks to certain Pals requires the weird lift and throw, and there are a lot of issues with Pals at base spawning in the landscape or some other location that blocks them from pathing to tasks, beds, and food.  Aside from that, it’s on par or better than most early access survival games, especially with technical performance
    Day one and the crafting stations use the shared boxes is chefs kiss.
    The best survival game? Like sure, it does things well, but it doesn't do anything better than any other survival game on the market.
        One of the better survival games does not mean the best. I would say my favorite survival game was Subnautica so far. But I think this has some better aspects than other survival games I have played. Better Graphics than ark S E, Better controller support than most of them, Better combat than say minecraft or no mans sky, more quality of life features than a lot of them. Im sure I can think of more but I think those demonstrate well enough as to why I said it is one of the better ones I have played. Not to say I did not like any of the games I am comparing this game to.
            Even one of the best is far fetched imo. The game does everything good. But is not great at anything.

Graphics are all right but they are not crazy either. Again, well executed but not great per se.

Combat is average, Valheim for example is way more engaging. Again the game execute well but isn't really great at combat.
                “One of the better…”, not *best*, and they said it twice. Just fucking read bro. There’s whole ass South Park episode about people like you.
                    Lol. Chill out

You can say whatever you want and bitch on semantic (because it's all you have). The game is average at best for a game of that kind.

It does nothing bad but it does nothing great either.

There's dozens of games that do better in different aspect of it. It is just average at everything.
>The game just looks unfinished.

The game is in early access... It IS unfinished...
    this is my issue w it. I loved their last game craftopia, but its been in EA for 4 years. They just kept adding content and not fixing shit that was already added. Im refraining from getting Palworld until/if they fully release it.
        I'm of the same mindset. No interest until full release.

That said, Baldurs Gate 3 was in early access for 3 years so I wouldn't judge a game purely by how long it's been in early access.
            Yes, but BG3 eventually released.  This developer now has three games in Early Access, but neither of the first two are even close to a full release.
            Larian had a history of delivering and finishing early access games, this studio has the opposite.
I liked to play it so much that I went through effort to host dedicated server to my friends.
    Same. Honestly, I think this is what modern Pokémon should have been by now.
it's fun AF, not gonna lie
I never saw any hype for this game til it released, after about 20 hours i can definetly say this is a legit great game, really it shows how much Nintendo is missing out by not doing something similiar earlier - For an early access game it is remarkably bug free and has heaps of content too
    The game *looks* so much better than Pokemon too. It's absolutely insane that gamefreak can release something as beautiful as Pokemon Emerald with timeless sprite art and music, and then with better technology release crap like Pokemon Violet which looks like a PS2 game and has some of the crappiest music I've ever heard (approaching Yu-Gi-Oh! game levels of crappy music). 

Palworld looks pretty crisp and has some nice music. Not perfect, but also not made by a studio as large, rich and experienced as gamefreak.
        because they don’t need to invest a lot into their games. They use the same formula with copy and pasted elements. Boom 10mill+ copies sold. It’s worked for 24+ years, and will continue to work.
            I don't think that's fair. Their early work (especially the first 3 gens) is clearly a labour of love. They put a lot of effort into those games and for the time they were incredible. And gen 3 still holds up in my opinion. 

They've been doing the same formula for a long time now, but it didn't start out that way.
        I wouldn't say it looks all that great. The pals don't fit in with the world style, they and the characters clash with it hard.

I hope somewhere along the way they make the world textures fit the Pals because it really sticks out.

Pokémon Violet doesn't look amazing either (so much pop in and low rez textures) but at least it's consistent.
You like Ark? You may like Palworld. You don't like Ark? You won't like Palworld.  


It's less so a pokemon game, and more so Ark, but instead of Dinosaurs, it uses monsters.
    [deleted]
        Hopefully that team can make good use of their new funds to expand this into something quite special.
            [deleted]
            Let's see, [4 million copies](https://www.pcgamer.com/that-pokemon-with-guns-game-palworld-just-sold-4-million-copies-in-3-days-and-it-isnt-slowing-down/) @ 26.99 dollars = 107.96 million dollars.

They've earned over 100 million dollars in just 4 days, they might be able to:

1. afford better offices/equipment
2. hire more developers
3. build a Scrooge McDuck money vault.
        not that it really matters, but the dev team during development was composed of 50+ people. still a feat tho
    I don't like Ark, and I like Palworld. Ark is a buggy unpolished grindfest. Palworld's what I wanted Ark to be like.
        Its funny because pal is in early-early access and it's less jank than Ark. The pals can at least pathfind decently
            It also runs so much better than ark. Ark has lag spikes every minute even on solo, palword has stable 60fps constantly
        Early develoment Ark was also horribly laggy, this game is very smooth in comparison.
        me too i hate ARK with my soul
        My experience with Ark a few years ago was spending multiple hours drugging a small dinosaur, then on my way back to my crappy base watching it get permanently killed by a giant alligator. In the same amount of Palworld I captured like 50 off-brand Pokemon and built two bases, it's more of a fun casual experience.
    ARK is shit in general, not really the best comparison.
        It is in fact the best comparison. Just because you do not like Ark does not mean this game isn't similar to Ark.
            True that.

But in terms of gameplay mechanics, isn't both Palworld and Ark similar to other games in the same genre? 

Base building from template structures, resource gathering (berries, stone, wood, smelting ore into ingots, etc.), weapon smithing, boss battling, world exploration, cave spelunking, different biomes, etc.

All these things are also things you can do/find in Valheim for instance.
                The systems for palworld are directly copy-pasted from Ark, they’re not just similar. The level progression is almost identical (level up, get points  to invest in escalating levels of tech, as well as picking small incremental stat upgrades). The monsters all serve a very specific function. The needing to craft specific saddles and harnesses to utilizes the monsters for their economic purpose.

Palworld takes most of its DNA from Ark, but it also has cherry-picked some things that worked in other recent innovative games. I see inspiration from BOTW/genshin, Elden ring, valheim, legends arceus, but this almost feels like an Ark mod with massive QOL inprovements.
    What about Valheim?
        Same genre of game. Valheim doesn't have taming, i think though? Which is why I would compare it to Ark.
            Ahh right okay. I haven’t played Ark. Valheim does have farming, but it’s not the focus of the game
I can’t believe how much fun it is. I saw the positive reviews for days and finally played all day yesterday and today and there’s so many awesome things that were never mentioned in reviews I read.
Not a fan of Ark/Pokémon,but i do enjoy Palworld
As far as I'm aware, it seems to be a good, sometimes great survival game whose popularity was boosted by the absolutely insane premise of legally distinct pokémon you can force into labor, butcher for food, and shoot at with guns.

my guess would be that the huge hype will die down, but it'll probably live a healthy life if the devs manage to update it at a good pace. With how many players are on right now, God knows they have the money for it.
I barely even know what polish means for video games
    Gry komputerowe is Polish for video games. ;-)
        Got em!
    From Poland
The best part about it is that it became an even bigger meme here in Brazil because Pal is pronounced the same way as "Pau", which means Wood but is also a slang for Dick.

Edit: i forgot to mention the country lol
    Agreed, stuff like pal fluid and big pals are the best part of the game.
        "come. Let me show you my pal"
            Now, let me show you my favorite pal.
It's very okay. There's a cross section of dejected players from both Ark and Pokémon which is why the massive numbers. 

It's competent, reasonably priced, functional and fun.

Yes, it will die out but there will be a solid player base.
It has all the charm of catching and fighting with Pokemon, all the exploration and combat of BOTW, all the survival aspects of Ark, and it some how seems to run extremely well. Honestly it's a killer game for what it is, and it's not even fully released yet.
    Id say remove "all" with "aspects of". I love being able to choose what moves my Pokemon have, the combat of BotW is much deeper than this, and a good amount of Arks survival, yes. This game is not THE perfect game, but it sure is doing many things right and is much more enjoyable than I ever thought it was going to be since I first saw the reveal trailer (i never thought I'd even buy it but here we are)
        You can swap around your Pal's abilities in the party menu and you can teach them new ones with skill fruits.
            You mean Devil Fruits. :D
        That's what lacks for me. More stuff and in depth things to do with those Pals. Let me chose between controlling them in combat or let AI do it's thing.

There's a lot of potential to explore on that part, because that's really the aspect that set him appart from other games.

The building system is too simple for me to really invite me spending time in it. 

And there's no real incitive to go out and get other Pals or better pals.
        The combat of botw might be a little bit deeper than palworld but having played hundreds of hours of it, it's not that deep. Most of the complexity was wholly unnecessary to regular gameplay, even on the hardmode.

Botw is a much, MUCH better exploration game and even a better speedrun game than it is a combat game. Totk isn't much better, the only way it truly expanded on combat is through the contraptions and additional map bosses.

Palworld has all of the exploration value botw had, and it's captivated my interest better than totk did, largely just because it's not the same damn map I played the first time. I daresay it does a better job, because shrines were dumb and koroks were a painful waste of your time. Palworld has more enemies to fight, more interesting collectables and points of interest to find, and you unlock advanced movement options quicker than you do in botw.

I think the main thing botw did better was bossfights and towns, and there's only 6 and 7 of those.

"Oh hey look, another bokoblin camp! Yay!"
        >the combat of BotW is much deeper than this

...eh. I can't say I'd agree. BoTW combat in particular is painfully simplistic, even when compared to the Zelda games that came before it nevermind when comparing it to most other modern games.
            Simple and deep can coexist. Its very easy to walk up to an enemy and just swing your sword until they die. But then you learn about perfect dodges and bullet time, which gives some nice depth while staying simple. Then you have the runes, which bombs alone are crazy, as well as shield partying, sneak strikes, head shots, etc that give you so many options to use. Not to mention weapons breaking and dealing critical damage and timing that to throw them for a final burst of damage.

The combat is simple, yes, but the further you delve the deeper it gets. Just look up the crazy combat clips and you'll get what I'm saying. Palworld doesn't have that depth.
                That's a fair assessment in comparison to Pal World, least, though I can't say I really find it any more interesting or engaging than most other modern AAA games.
    So is their other game.

Neither is their other game.
        Lots of games go into early access. It’s a bit of a trap now, but it’s often done to secure funding and ensure more development. 

Lots of successful games were built in and stayed in EA up until a release years later. And likewise lots have been abandoned after their game didn’t sell. 

Look to see if they are communicating and updating. Or if not updating at least communicating about updating. 

For my own game we are not going to do EA, but instead continue to update after our intended release. But also have monthly communication about our plans and milestones.
If you think this game is Janky, you don't know jank.
It's the only game I'm playing right now.
    It came out 3 days ago.
It's like Pokémon + Ark Survival Evolved + Rimworld
    I would add that it also has a dash of breath of the wild.
        A dash? The music queue and the UI when you enter a new area is just BOTW designs
It's genuinely super fun. If you like Ark, Pokemon, and Zelda, you'll like Palworld
I like it if you enjoy Ark you will enjoy the gameplay loop. The Anime Aesthetic and Pokemons are a huge plus if you're a fan of those. I downloaded it because I try everything that gets added to gamepass and before I knew it I sunk 4 hrs in
Imagine playing ARK but with off brand pokemons and modern guns. That's the game
I played it for 4 hours last night and was actually really fun
Do you like base building survival games? How about Monster Hunter where you go about and fight the wild life?

Because that is essentially Palworld.

I know this kind of game isn't going to be for everyone, but I have been having a BLAST playing it.
My take as someone who’s not played it so it doesn’t really count lol is that it looks beautiful and also is a cool idea but I’m not jumping in yet because I have other games that I’ve not finished and I lose interest in games once they become slightly repetitive and this seems slightly repetitive. However it looks beautiful and I will watch more footage of how it plays.
I am enjoying it for sure. 8.5 hours in and I am still having fun. I have a detour with BG3 and Diablo 3 Season 30. But after I finish up Season 30 I will be jumping back into Palworld.
I can name, actually I can't name, about 5 to 7 other survival games that have strictly less content and quality of life.  


Of course if you enjoy the game hinges largely on what you think of the MONs and the automation of gathering/refining/crafting.  At it's core is a pretty competent survival game though.  For me what does it is that it gives you a reason to enjoy exploring, you might find a chest or might find a new mon or a shiny mon.  That's what separates good survival games from bad for me is excitement of actually finding something useful and not wading through the same old randomized crap looking for the one resource you're short on.  The quality of life with chest sorting, crafting from chests, high stack #s etc. is objectively on point.  

It is just a very silly game that contrasts cute anime mons with real world colonialism.  The base attacks get annoying some times, but at least you have mons to help you defend.  It's not for everyone in that regard, but it does a lot to move the genre forward and has ambitious stuff planned like 32 person 4v4v4v4... PVP.  


For 10% off $30 and being in early access it's pretty solid, but you never know where EA games will end up.  Could be forgotten by next month and never finished like so many other survival games, could be a game everyone is talking about in 10 years still like minecraft, LoL or fortnite.
Same, I have no clue. Seems like people like pokemons like game, also with crafting
Artist questions and dev reliability aside 

This game is in early access so literally an unfinished game, I feel like loads of people need to understand that. If you play single player the jank is relatively low, nothing game breaking or that and tbh I have had fun with it so far it there are far worse games out there you could be spending 25 quid or more on
Seems like flavor of the month to me
    It’ll be dead in 2 weeks just like among us and fall guys
    This flavour of the month is in the history books forever now as one of the most successful launches ever on Steam, in both sales numbers and most concurrent players.
        I don’t know about that one chief 😂
            As someone who doesn't get it, it objectively is. Achieving 3 million sales in 48 hours and having an active player base of over 1 million on steam is groundbreaking for what was a relatively unknown developer. Even if those numbers crash and burn in say a week.
                Thing is, this game isn’t something people will remember in like 5-10 years. No one in 10 years will be like remember Palword? Good times. No, because it’s a flavor of the month game that doesn’t have longevity. Compare it to something like Minecraft that people talk about to this day. It’s a sudden spike in popularity but I predict it will crash and burn very fast and be forgotten soon.
                    Even if that's true, it's still worth to play and enjoy something even for a short period of time. The game is genuine fun and unique imo. Will I be playing it in a month or two? Don't know, but I've already gotten my money's worth (GamePass) and enjoyed my time.
                    They will remember it because it’s in the history books now, you can’t look up top purchased game on steam without seeing Palworld
            He’s objectively correct?
            I’m not just making that up… go look
Pokemon Sword and Shield just came out (awful quality), we joked about a third game and called it Pokemon Gun  
Then Palworld trailers pop up, and people are like "omg, they actually made Pokemon Gun"  
everyone been on the hypetrain ever since
I watched the trailer and you're right, it does look pretty janky. The AK47 assembly line made me laugh out loud though, it's hard to believe it's not a meme.
    Just some Pokémon practicing their second amendment rights 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅
        🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Bought game today as wanted see what's all hype for, like you said, it did feel janky and unpolished, but then again it is early access, anyway I refunded it, maybe I'll check it year from now.
    What was janky about it?
        - Crashes/bugs

- limited keybinds (french keyboard have that weird thing where "4" and the "$" symbol are inverted, so I have to type "MAJ+$" to get "4", but it doesn't work in game, I just can't repair buildings)

- Stats balance

- tech points acquisition solo vs multiplayer balance. (basically the whole progression system is janky)

- Pal balance

- NPC's are barebone.

- The texts aren't all there yet (lots of "en text" as descriptions)

- generic UI

- No "exit the game" button, I have to either switch to window mode or kill it with the task manager.
            >Crashes/bugs

Yes

>limited keybinds (french keyboard have that weird thing where "4" and the "$" symbol are inverted, so I have to type "MAJ+$" to get "4", but it doesn't work in game, I just can't repair buildings)

Don't see how that's the game's problem, how about using a normal keyboard.

> Stats balance

You're the one that puts the stat points on the character, so that does sound like skill issue.

> tech points acquisition solo vs multiplayer balance. (basically the whole progression system is janky)

There's not a difference between solo and multiplayer unless the host decides to change it.

> Pal balance

Don't know what you mean with this.

>- NPC's are barebone.

Somewhat yes.

>The texts aren't all there yet (lots of "en text" as descriptions)

Didn't have this problem with the spanish translation so far.

> generic UI

I've seen worse but yes.

>No "exit the game" button, I have to either switch to window mode or kill it with the task manager.

Straight up false. You only need to press ESC and the last option in the menu allows you to exit your save and then exit the game.
    Their other game is abandonware but they probably won't abandon this one since it's so popular
        lmao, sure...
Its a janky survival game. If you like janky survival games you will probably like palworld. I bought it because i saw all of the 1 and 2 million sold posts, and i really dont understand the hype. 

Here are some really bad annoyances for me at the moment:

* Pals get stuck into the floor and walls around your base, you have to relog constantly to reset their position or they will die of hunger
* Melee combat is atrociously bad, like really really really bad
* there are just a Couple of dungeons that constantly get recycled
* Catching pals is just boring
* Really the only big use ive found for pals is to leave them at your base for base automation, and take some with passives that help you, and a bird that you can ride.
* Some of the pals are not "inspired by" pokemon, but just straight copies with minimal differences, games like Temtem and Nexomon have way more original monsters so i dont think pokemon having over 1k mons is a good defence for ripping them off
* There are sound effects like going to a new area that plays a sound effect that sounds almost identical to what youd find in BOTW

Like i said, i dont really understand the hype, and after playing it for about 20 hours, it just feels like a pretty basic survival game with random pokemon slapped on it.
    If a pal gets stuck you can go to the pal box and recall them then deploy them again.
        That just takes more time than save quitting
    [deleted]
        Catching pals is boring because i double tap their face with a shotgun, and they get to 3% hp and i still have 20% catch chance with the ultra sphere and 2x boost from world settings against level 40 pals while being 40 myself. After that im just spamming Spheres for like 5 times, and after using up my 30 spheres i have to grind 20mins for the next 30 again.

I havent played Ark before so i dont know about its taming mechanics, but atleast with pokemon i can get new and better balls pretty much more easily, and the catch rate feels better in that.

To be fair i had a similar problem in legends arceus where i sometimes had to spam a mon with balls.

Also how do you get exp? like 90% of my exp comes from first 10 catches of a specific pal variety so its a pretty fucking big focus on the gameplay loop lmao.

I think ive given the game a fair shot, being at 26 hours now, and using most of my vacation day playing it on a monday.

fuck off
            [deleted]
                Are you actually trolling? Am i just being wooshed really badly? Also you just totally didnt read my response because i already said that i have maxed out the capture rate and it still feels bad. Its about as engaging as actual pokemon catching because you just stand there waiting for the sphere to fail and throw again multiple times in a row in higher levels.

You just sound like a fanboy at this moment because we cant criticize your beloved pokemon killer or some shit like that.

I played the game and said what i feel about it, hopefully most of my problems get fixed with patches along the early access updates, but im writing about current problems.

Fuck off again
                    [deleted]
                        I really fell for it man lmao gj :D
                            still have yet to respond to any of my rebuttals. Have a good day little guy 
                                Cmon man you can stop already :P the jig is up :D
Try playing it
    With only two hours for a refund… hard to really know 
        go to the high seas test it there then buy it.
            Some of us aren’t good sailors 😅
        I knew within the first hour that it was shit.
Its fun but it wont stay on top tho :) but i really enjoy it now cant say i will after 100+ hours if they put no new content in it
ive only played it for like 3 hours now, so i cant say anything about the end game / if its still fun after more.

but i personally like the game. i expected to see all features half-done or implement without much of a focus, but they do work well together. it actually looks pretty well to be fair - and doesnt look like AI at all.
It's still early access but it's quite fun to play for the most part.
I actually like it, it feel like ark but with a spice of zelda and a good Dip of Pokémon and Slavery :D
You were probably watching multiplayer footage, which has a serious memory leak issue right now, as well as general optimization issues. It actually runs buttery smooth in single player.
One small thing that annoys me is that i cant bind an action to my mouse 4 and 5 buttons.
The game **IS** unfinished. It's an early access.

There are some bugs, mostly with AI, where enemies or pals on your camp will get stuck on a rock, a wall, or even nothing. Pathfinding needs some work.

You've got tasks to do up until your first proper boss fight, then no more tasks. I feel like they will add more later on to kinda bring some sort of storyline. Right now you can figure out some stuff by wandering around and talking to NPCs. 

It kinda gets very grindy by that point. The loop can be resumed to "you grind levels to be able to fight and capture higher pals and unlock better crafts to get even higher". For now at least. I expect a lot of new content in future updates.
“The game just looks unfinished” maybe because it isn’t lol
Bit of both. It’s a fun game, I don’t think it’s going to keep up big numbers like this. This developer runs entirely on plagiarising bits from other games so will be interesting to see what (other people’s) ideas the add next
Palworld is a good game, I haven't gotten it, but i've watched youtube videos of it, and it looks good. The only way to describe it is if pokemon was created by america instead of japan.

It has a little bit of everything. Pokemon, slavery, battles. guns. survival. pokemon. pvp(? i think.) multiplayer for sure.

It is in early access right now, so don't expect it to have everything or remain the same over time. They will of course add stuff. and if it remains popular it may grow into a huge game.
Im having a blast! Only played a hour but so far im enjoying it very much compared to ark, the jankyness to me isnt bad might have a few hiccups but its pretty smooth so far, but remember its early access so its not fully done and i expect the devs to iron it out more and more
It's ark so expect a similar life cycle as that. Popular for 6 months then dies down to a smaller player base. That's if they bother to keep the game going with regular updates
i’m loving it. i’m a sucker for a game with good animations
Nexomon is a REALLY good fake pokemon game, In my opinion better than any of the modern pokemon games.
I've been playing palworld for the last couple days. My only previous experience with this gameplay loop is with ark survival evolved on a solo world near the time that game released.

Palworld is a massive improvement over my old experience with Ark. Pals are much easier to capture than dinosaurs were for me in Ark. The item system is complex yet intuitive to me, everything seems well explained and straightforward. Movement feels very good, ripped straight out of botw/genshin but with a dark souls dodge roll. Mounted pals are easy and consistent to control. The combat is okay. you might find it clunky by other game standards, but weapons are responsive and I never miss shots that I feel like should've hit, likewise I never get hit by projectiles where I feel that I dodged them.

All in all: the game is a very consistent experience with very good qol. I can in good conscious tell you that I do not think the game is clunky.
I like it. I think it's pretty fun especially since it's early access. I mean granted they don't take everyone's money and dip.
I like it, it's like ark and pokemon
It's a fun mix of Ark, Pokemon and even some of the free-roam Zelda games botw/totk. It can be as much fun as you have with it - it's definitely not bad, but it is a bit janky at times in ways that personally I didn't mind at all. I'm assuming with so many players in such a short time frame the devs won't give up on it anytime soon.
With more story content updates I think it'll have a really good quality improvement arc like with Cyberpunk or No Man's Sky, but without being absolutely broken at launch like those games were.

That being said, my one gripe is the audio. The quality of some of the sounds is pretty rough.
I really like it but honestly ill be surprised it it doesn't get Cease and Desist'ed
I dig it 🤷🏼‍♂️
The ui and controls can use some work. Other Than that it’s fun och ok. It’s not a bad game and I see a lot of potential
The animations and combat are more fleshed out than ARK ever was
You're describing an early access game as looking janky and unfinished. Give it time.
It'll die out.
It’s an early access, open world, survival, crafting game. Of course it’s just a meme that will die out, especially since the meme is how it copies Pokemon designs.
I think it's about as good as Rust is, so mostly fun jank being ridden on a wave of nonsense and memes.

Thing is that jank can be entertaining.  Palworld has a lot of wack nonsense going for it

edit: the jank of both games still allows people to get what they want out of it, with the jank adding to the entertainment.
It’s on gamepass. For a free game that came out of nowhere it’s awesome
Yes
If I'm being honest the graphics and art direction *currently* looks like a unity asset flip/game devs first game vibe , can't say about the gameplay since i haven't played it but that's the impression I get from the steam front page and the other playthroughs done by my friends and other content creators, i don't really have problems with its gameplay and stuff mainly just it's vibe . But seeing many people but it is actually assume it's a pretty good game so it's not a bad thing to buy cause at least I'm not hearing it's a buggy broken mess that most AAA game turn out to be now
 Someone needs to make a good pokemon for once, and here we go
It'll be like valhiem. Solid game that explodes in popularity before settling down to a healthy 10-20k player count
The game is still in early access
It's polished for a day 1 survival game, but very rough when compared to finished titles.  
There is a huge amount of gamers that love these types of games, so that's why the player count is so high, they are used to playing early alpha games.  
As long as they continue to develop it, it'll have a good population. Rust is an old game with a bunch of players still playing it, but the devs were very transparent during the process and their other game was Garry's mod, which is a sandbox title, so gamers had confidence it was going to be finished one day and it did.
Just play it for yourself & see tbh
It's the next Pokemon Go.
Well it’s definitely not a meme.
It's honestly not as great as the hype suggest. It's basically doing everything most other survival game do and it does it well but nothing more.

That's kind of the thing. Everything is pretty... Whelmed.

Building is fairly simple. Nothing crazy. But it is well executed.

Survival is simple. Nothing crazy but it is well executed.

The creature part is simple but it's well executed.

Basically that's it. The game is not ground breaking, it just brings different element you could see in other games in this one and it does it well. But nothing ground breaking.

I wish for more "Pokémon like" mechanics.

I think the FPS is useless. And the interaction and control over your "Pals" too few.

I wish we could actually control in real time what technic they use rather than them having a set of habilities that they use at their discretion. Or at least have the choice to let them do as they wish or command them to use certain abilities.
Streambait, the only "pokemon" thing are the monsters design, people are just using this game to shit on pokemon.
It’s a fairly compelling game especially since I’m not a massive fan of the two games it keeps getting compared to
I was a bit afraid at first because it is from the same devs as craftopia but the basics are much more developed than that game. I am missing some functions like being able to adjust my camera distance. 


I just hope it won't be a low effort followup same as craftopia. That game was intended to have around 1 year of early acces.. after a few years it still is and development slowed down a LOT.
First time I played a base building game, actually enjoyed upgrading the tech tree
the gameplay is good. the netcode is shit. official servers are booty. i hope they attempt to do something about it cause its not really worth it to play with other people rn
Have you played Conan Exiles? It's that but with Pokémons.
Its early Access, pals tend to get stuck on nothing. Inventory managements doesn't really work well and its janky as hell.

That being said, its absolutely addicting and an amazing game with room to grow.
It feels like Ark x Pokemon. The artstyle is cute, its awesome that automation works so you can do stuff while your pals gather stuff for you.

I can see people playing this for a really long time, unless the devs fuck Up majorly.

Initially i thought it would be a huge meme game, like haha Pokemon with guns but its suprisingly deep, even though its in EA and at version 0.12 or something
 Nobody will care about this game in a month.
    Not even a month, my friends are already hammering the game like crazy, they'll be done by next week...
    This is the real copium lmao
It’s a game preview.

The description on Steam says they plan to develop for a year with audience feedback.

It’s pretty wild, but I think it will get pretty old pretty quickly. I tried it on Game Pass and I’m board of the survival grind 2 hours in whereas I’m loving Return to Moria.
    Game Pass version is supremely buggy and so very inconsistent compared to Steam version.
        I learned that shortly after I posted here… I really don’t like paying for early access games.

But this one is getting A TON of attention, so maybe it’ll actually release and have the polish I would hope for.
If you want to play a good pokemon game, try Cassette Beasts. It's on Steam, xbox, and Switch
It’s a game that will die similar to fall guys. It’s popular thing right now and will probably be popular for a month or so
Liking it a lot so far, playing alone and with friends. Its great but is still lacking in a few parts but has potential to get much better as well.

My big problem with it. Its from the same guys who made craftopia, game also seemed cool, had fun with it, but always felt like it could have more, which as an early access , I was just waiting for the updates... then it stopped updating... Then palworld came along and I knew it wouldn't update anymore...

Really liking pal so far, but I fear it may be abandoned in a year or so.
    Craftopia was just updated in December and they have a whole 2024 roadmap lined out
        Yeah, it took them a long time to update because they did a massive change to the game when they made it into a seamless map instead of the island system that was originally there.
        If I just had a birthday in December, that doesn't mean I have birthdays all the time. They cut the pace of development by two thirds once Palworld was announced.
    Craftopia didn’t become the most played game on steam history lol
It’s pretty fun to play with friends if you like ark,  Pokémon, Valheim, I’m hoping it’s not just a scam and they actually improve it before the full release but either way at $25 (it was on sale when I bought it) worth like 20 hours and counting of fun with my friends
For a survival game it is great, I personally love games that end with automation. The battle is pretty good, there are different style and different feel between each palmon. While this is still early access, I think they have many ways to expend the world, so it got me looking forward to it.

There is few glitches, like I glitched off the map multiple times, my base mon keep glitching into the mountain so I have to drag it out and back in. And stuff get super expensive to craft much later on.

But overlooking those problems, the game is honestly pretty fun. I know I'll stop after a month, but if there are more updates on world and more mon, I'll definitely come back to play.
I think the first trailers made people think it was a 1 trick pony / a "meme" but no, its actually a game. And like what somepeople have stated, a very functional EA game. 

As for your other questions:

Is it janky? Yes (tho i have played a lot of slav jank so this is extremely light compared to those games). If it looks unfinished to you. It might be because its EA or youre not used to how survival sandboxes looks like.

Is it a good game? Depends on the player. People who wants a survival sandbox game with creatue collecting element will get a kick out of it. Sadly, if youre not into that market, this wont change your mind.

Is it unpolished? I'd say no. Just lacking certain things such as a lot of QOL stuff but its fully playable thought i havent been bug hunting so i cant tell how far the rabbithole goes.

Is it a pokemon game? Sorta. But its is 2nd genre but the structure is extremely different to that of pokemon.

Does it looks like an AI tried to replicate a game? No... theres thought put into it. Its a lot of old ideas mashed together and it works tbqh (tho again, ymmv).

Is it just some fad that is going to die out? I dont understand this question. The answer is yes, just like most things, the playerbase will slow down and dwindle to a reasonable number depending on how fast can the devs work on new content. Hell, elden averages to a healthy 60k players these days. I wouldnt call that a dead game. Besides, who cares. Its not an online only thing. You can play the game in single player. Does the overall active playerbase affects your enjoyment of something?

If you think its not for you then its not for you. Just move on XD
Not my type of game but I enjoyed it for a bit.
Even though it’s early access it holds up pretty well. If’s basically a full game. Think Ark mixed with Digimon DS and a catching mechanic like Pokemon. Gameplay is a mix of Ark, Rust, Pokemon, Digimon, Ghost Recon, and Rimworld is some ways.
I think Pokémon with guns is a real disservice to the game actually, it’s more like breath of the wild and ark combined in a Pokémon setting, all rates are easily fully customisable, I went in with 2x gathering, 1.5x resource hp, 4x xp and I’ve been having an absolute blast, can’t remember the last game I bought then played for 15 hours straight, especially since I bought it at like 6pm, seriously it’s been years since that’s happened. 

An important part of judging early access games is the questions of “is it worth the full price if development stopped now” and “if development stopped now, could it pass as a complete game” and my answer to both of these is a resounding yes, having trudged through enough early access shit to make any pigs week, I’m genuinely surprised at the quality of this launch and the attention to detail, for example, every creature having its own crit spots, the first boss is far easier to take down if you focus the women riding the creature. 

This game IS the Pokémon game everyone always wanted, the one the fans asked for, it’s what Arceus could have been if gamefreak and the Pokémon company didn’t have a weird contempt for their fans where they refuse to deliver what they are repeatedly asked for, they slept on it for years, and now rightly so, someone came along and did it better.
So far, Palworld is the Pokemon game i've wanted since I was a kid.   
Actual open world with actual live battles.  
Movement feels like Breath of the Wild, and it's multiplayer too.  
It scratches a lot of itches, and i'm really stoked with it so far.  
The game looks unfinished because it is, it's an early-access title.
It's going to lose a ton of players within a week or two like Valheim did because most gamers don't like or understand survival games where you build and craft.
Read the negative reviews in Steam, there's interesting text there.

(Always read negs before buying anything.)
I mean, it *is* unfinished. It's in early access at v0.1 (I think). I haven't bought it and don't plan to so I have no dog in this fight but saying it feels unfinished as a point against it is pointless when it's unashamedly unfinished.
I didn't even know this game existed until it released. I don't even like Pokémon, but I do enjoy a good survival game. Giving it the benefit of the doubt, I decided to sail the high seas to try it & to also see if it would run on my system. I ended up putting 20 hours or so into it. I liked it enough that I deleted the copy & my save & bought it on Steam so I could start again. 

&#x200B;

>the game looks janky as hell

Honestly, Its one of the less janky Early Access/Surivial games that I've played recently. The controls could certainly be better. There's also some small QoL issues that's missing, but overall it's decently polished for an Early Access title.

&#x200B;

>The game just looks unfinished.

Well, yeah, it's Early Access. What did you expect?

&#x200B;

I can tell you right now, it's far better than ARK ever was, or currently is.
As a *HUGE* fan of both survival crafting games like Ark and Valheim as well as creature collectors like the Pokémon and Digimon series, Palworld is a *FANTASTIC* fusion of both.
  
Remember how big Valheim was when it came out? Took the gaming world by storm for like 2 weeks.
  
This does survival crafting better than Valheim, *plus* add the base gameplay loop from *Pokémon Legends: Arceus* that Pokémon fans pretty universally considered "a breath of fresh air".
  
Honestly I'm 30 hours in, have only done *one* boss tower (out of like 5 I think?), and don't see am end to enjoyment in sight.
  
And this is only in *early access?* so long as it isn't kept in purgatory like the crap-fest that is Craftopia, Palworld is going to be a gem that people dust off the shelves every two years or so to play with friends.
V Rising and Valheim were huge too.

It’s a “game of the month”. It’ll be gone soon.
    Both of those games still have healthy player numbers. It’s like the top 0.1% of games can maintain hundreds of thousands of players forever. Games not dead when literally thousands of people are playing it everyday
Meme
its a meme
Imma say it’ll die fairly quick
Janky as hell and looks unpolished is also the perfect description of the most recent Pokemon game. Just saying
There wasn't any AI used to actually make any of the characters, they just intentionally replicated the style. It's kind of impressive what the studio did considering how incompetent they were starting out. I hear a 13 year old did the gun animations, and they didn't actually know what an "animation rig" was called when they started out because this is their first time making original assets for one of their games instead of buying them. The fact that it works, especially after everyone had to switch from Unity to Unreal, is amazing.

But also it's basically ARK with Pokemon, and ARK is a shit game and the novelty of Pokemon with guns or being able to do cannibalism is just not going to fix that.
I literally can't stop playing it. It has to be one of the best games ever honestly. It's super fun, it feels like prime minecraft where you enjoy building bases, designing it, and go adventure.

 It's a combination of Minecraft + Pokemon. I saw the top comment saying 

"I wouldn't advise comparing it to pokemon"

 but you \*LITERALLY\* capture other animals (in this case pokemon) that have different elements like ice, water, fire, etc and then both you and your party of five pokemon go and adventure out and capture more animal/pokemon and fight difficult bosses 

It's minecraft + pokemon, and it's not a bad thing at all. It's literally my favourite game right now. I can play 8 hours straight (with pee and food breaks included)
personally a meme that will die out due to not being all that interesting except for having pokemon esque (which is using ai content at this point it undeniable cause grifter who use ai will always use it)
Its your typical hype game. The news like bad games that doesn't have a shelf life after the initial month of release. The gaming industry is filled with those from AAA to shovelware game makers these days.
    You’re an idiot for the use of “hype game”. wtf is that? Most games lately have a shelf life of a few weeks after initial release. Your comment is dumb as fuck bc it gives zero evidence and makes a click bait comment that likely applies to most games.
        Hype game 
Like battlebit
I tried it and it is 100% just a meme. Got baited hard.
It’s the type of survival game I find that’s bad (it’s an ark clone), but if you like ark you will like this if you don’t it’s not for you.
    I feel oit of the loop Here. Everybody's comparing it to ark and I'm like what's ark
        ARK:Survival Evolved. Survival gane where you can fight and tame dinosaurs. And apparently the sequel has vin diesel or something? Idk it’s weird.
        Ark survival evolved. It's a survival game with dinosaurs you can tame, largely has similar aspects like exploring, base building. Crafting, resource management etc
It’s an early access game that has more content than a lot of fully finished games. Was this post really necessary? Can’t tell if it’s a troll attempt, as the game is literally labeled as unfinished.
    >It’s an early access game that has more content than a lot of fully finished games. Was this post really necessary? Can’t tell if it’s a troll attempt, as the game is literally labeled as unfinished.

Obvious the creators of this game aren't a massive triple A title developer team, so from  a small team standpoint, is it a good idea to develop another game when they already have another game that is also unfinished and still in early access? I could be entirely wrong but to me that doesn't seem to make sense, if they abandon that other game of theirs, who's to say they won't do the same with this game and create a 3rd game years down the road when they've made enough money?

Yeah the game is not finished, doesn't mean it can't have criticism, and my main complaints are the game looks junky and looks like it was made by a AI. Nothing personal, not hating and I haven't tried it so you can't count this as a review, just a question for people who've played it to answer, nothing personal man.
        I only bought Palworld because of what the team has done with Craftopia. Yes Craftopia is still in Early Access, but it receives regular and frequent updates and is a complete game even without being out of EA. Palworld, if they added nothing more to it, would be well worth the $27 I paid for it. Based on their track record, though, we're going to see a huge amount of updates and QoL additions in the coming months. Pocket Pair is a legit good dev team. 

Try it - you'll probably enjoy it.
            > Yes Craftopia is still in Early Access, but it receives regular and frequent updates

Worth noting they cut the pace of development by two thirds after announcing Palworld. Seems a lot of development resources were moved off that project.
        Yeah I doubt it was made by AI. How about trying it out for yourself?
            Like i said, i have no interest in this game and was genuinely asking if this game is actually any good or if it was just a meme, which led to everyone buying it to try it out.
                so try it out if you want to know lmao, opinions are subjective you know, giving criticism like "the game looks janky" when you haven't even touched the game feels a little strange to me. 

it sounds like you already have a preconceived notion of what to feel about the game in your head and all you want is validation tbh
                Good is subjective. Pretty easy to figure out if the game is a meme or not
It's just ARK, with a few cloned Fortnite assets and AI-gen Pokémon. Literally nothing new or different about it except Pokémon can make expressions and dinosaurs can't.
Im leaning meme, the combat and actual creature systems are both not very fun lacking any real depth and the writing/worldbuilding is reallllll bad. The walking around and collecting itself is fun, just no nuance to the actual raising of creatures. The only reason I felt compelled to play for longer than a couple hours was to see new creatures to see what franchise they were pretty unceremoniously ripped from. Fun for a few days, longer with friends, but I don't think it's gonna keep this traction without a combat overhaul, some sort of PvP, and a less lifeless world.
I dont get why people liked Ark or Rust in the first place.
    Dinosaurs grrr
It is going to die out. Or at least get to the level its supposed to. At max about 80 to 100k players Daily if the game is update like they claim they will.
The studio who developed it also made Craftopia. That game was an obvious asset flip that has been getting fake updates for years now. Nothing really changed, some patch notes were even obvious bullshit made up to sound like something changed. IIRC there's a third game from that company out there that's also a blatant asset flip.

Personally I won't bother with Palworld because of exactly that. I fell for Craftopia and every time I read the recent patch notes I just get extremely angry at myself for falling for it. I won't fall for Palworld.

Should it ever get finished I might give it a try. But I'm not holding my breath for that.
It is mediocre at best. The gameplay loop might be working for about 20-30 hours, but I don't see that the game will be able to keep the players once they reach the end game. Even in mid game I already reached a point where I don't get new interesting unlocks or features that keep me interested. I already have to sort of force myself to keep playing.

My prediction is: The hype will last for another two weeks, then the high player counts will go down and it will mostly turn into a meme.

The people will then see the game for what it is: an unfinished mediocre game that needs another two years in development and polish. To me it is an overhyped early access game at the moment.
These comments are depressing. How can you all spend money on such an obviously mediocre and AI-generated game and be happy, when there are dozens of quality games out there that you've never played?

You're all falling for marketing tricks. I hope you'll wake up one day.
    ok mom
    >an obviously mediocre and AI-generated game

I finally checked it out yesterday, after all the really unnecessary hype, and those were pretty much my first. It looks like the most generic 2020s game possible. It's like someone asked *Alexa*, not even chat gpt, what are the most popular tropes in the present gaming industry. Pokemon, shooting, survival crafting and building, and that fortnite and genshin children's graphics. I've not checked if it has micro-transactions and some form of battle royale mode, but all signs say it should.

I get that I'm 100% not the target audience, but this looks like the laziest work that ever entered Steam's top played list. Not one original thought went into it. Probably most of the effort went into getting "influencers" to hype.

Sad day for the gaming industry.
        I totally blame consumers for this. Such lack of effort and creativity should never have been rewarded.
No one will be playing in a month.
    /s
Just another hyped boring game that most probably Will be abandoned in a while. But hey if you like pokemon with Guns maybe you Will enjoy it, i really didnt like it
The only concern I've seen is the developers also made craftopia. I saw a few comments saying they sort of just took that game's base and added the Pokemons. And looking at some artwork, they do look very similar.

That's not immediately a bad thing, but craftopia is also early access, 4 years old. I expect this game was a way to generate revenue and renew interest, in a way providing a full update to craftopia would not.

It looks like a fun game, but I wouldn't buy it with the expectation it will ever leave early access.
It’s Pokémon x Botwx Elden Ring

It’s super fun. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I do. 
I does look good for Early Access. However, something that was brought to my attention while checking out the game reviews is that these are the same developers that released a couple of other Early Access games, Craftopia being one of them. Apparently they had a projected plan to finish Craftopia in a year but it is still in Early Access after about 4 years and now they have released this new, similar game with pokemon like creatures thrown in. 

I was initially pretty interested but now I am very doubtful it will receive many updates and leave EA. Plus all the people who bought Craftopia and were hoping for more updates are most likely expecting it is pretty much abandoned now that Palworld exists.

Kinda makes me sad since it could develope into something really fun if it was finished, and I dislike when devs throw their games out in EA and never update them, profiting off it and moving on before cleaning up and finishing projects.
You do realize this game is in early access correct? It is not by any means a AAA final release game. The developer is looking at feedback and refining the game. I have watched a few hours of it and it has its small problems but nothing to bad. I'm definitely going to pick it up when I can.
this post looks like an AI tried to replicate a rant about a new game without looking into it much

it plays like ark or valheim mixed with Legends Arceus. it’s very obviously taken lots of inspiration from pokémon, and it’s early access yet far more polished than the release versions of scarlet and violet

there are guns, you can choose not to use them

there’s also automation kinda like Satisfactory but that stuff clearly needs work

all games are derivative, but a negative for this one is that it seems to be taking ideas from too many games at once
Redditors when the game doesnt look like RDR2:
Given that they are using stolen assets, I'm going to be opposed to anything that comes out of this studio.
It's better than Pokemon's attempt at open world. I fear the slavery possibly involved in late game but I'm enjoying it right now putting my "pals" to work while I explore and capture more pals.
    Tbh that is a gimmick. They are more like your units than slaves. Ex in all strategy games your units are pretty much yours to command and here similarly. 

Are normal original Pokemon kinda like slavery? If yes then this is also.
it's a meme. the artstyle is non-consistent at all, everything looks like its slapped together from 5 different games. the company is known to not finish their games. the gameplay is pretty much a carbon copy of already existing games.
Extremely janky over hyped survival game with the memes of Pokemon with guns. If you need an Ark ripoff, you will find what you are looking for. If you want a polished experience, this is not it.
    Its, early acces, ofc its unfinished duh.
        Okay? Their other game is still "Early Access" after 3.5 years.
            “Games take a long time to make so it’s bad when an early access game also takes a long time to make”
            Star citizen is still in alpha after 10 years of development, still its a game. Buggy mess but still a game.

There is no point complaining just released early acces(alpha or beta) stage game as unfinished.

Thats why its called early acces. Devs try probably finance further development or then its money grab.

Anyway, for me it has been fun experience so far.

If you dont like unfinished games, dont buy earlyacces games.
Tried it for 1 hour. Was insufferable with tedious tasks. Uninstall.
    Do you have the attention span of a gold fish? Lmfao. This is one of the easiest starts to a survival game that I've ever played lmfao
        Being easy to start doesn't mean it's not insufferable or tedious.
            I just don't see it. It's a survival game. Lmfao. It literally let's you automate two of the games most basic resources early. It rewards you for exploring and getting new pals. 

Just sounds like it just isn't your kind of game.
i feel its mostly carried by the hype. its just an ark clone with a shitty pokemon ripoff skin splayed over it for a quick buck.

&#x200B;

oh, and the owner is an ai/cryptobro so...
    >oh, and the owner is an ai/cryptobro so...

Didn't know that, but this actually makes the most sense of anything that has ever made sense. It should have been rather obvious.
        Tbh i love that im getting downvoted when im right XD
100% meme. There’s no way people play seriously.
It's a meme game to keep you busy.
ARK is better
I urge you to not play it. It is made by a company that openly gloats about using AI generated models, images & gameplay. Plagiarized assets are everywhere. The company has repeatedly plagiarized other games.

https://twitter.com/lglizard/status/1748845140658024816?t=KwW9Q2dM1v3o_L70tlFGcA&s=19
    It's sad I had to scroll this far down to see this mentioned. Craftopia was a cheap asset flip with obvious fake patches to create an illusion of it being worked on.

Palworld is a successful scam.
Yeah the Pokemon with guns summary that so many people keep repeating is kind of misleading, more like Ark with Pokemon. 

People going in thinking it is more of a Pokemon game are being misled imo.
    It is 100% Ark with Pokemon.  Anyone who says different is simply not familiar with Ark
        And considering Ark already had poke balls for you dinosaurs it really isn't a big departure. But Ark was honestly pretty bad, Palworld feels like Ark but actually with some intelligent thought behind the design.
            and slavery as well.
                My favorite
                You can basically do that in Ark, it's just instead of making them work you force feed them poop as they waste away in a cage
                    that's torture not slavery, sir. Get your human rights violations in order.
            Also, it is designed more with 2 players or single players in mind. Vs ark, which is designed to be played with multiple players.
                Dang.  Was hoping to co-op with my 3 friends.  Is it available to play this way at all?
                    You definitely can. It is up to 32 players with a dedicated server, and I think 4 with normal in game hosting.
            Ark, but it respects your time and I don’t have to clear acres of land just to get a decent level 1 base
            Probably the biggest advantage Palworld has over Ark (specifically for your gaming platform) is that Palworld is just under 7 gigabytes in size, compared to over a hundred for Ark (these sizes are from the Xbox versions, they might be different on steam).

The second biggest is that everything is adorable in Palworld.
                I think Ark crosses the 200GB mark on PC with all dlcs. It’s a poorly coded game and absolutely massive.
            yeh ark was always about collecting/taming  "monsters" even without the pokeballs
        It’s just not as hardcore as ark either. I don’t have any gray hairs from playing this haha
        Ark has guns and people are saying it's Pokemon with guns and survival elements... Checks out to me
        To be fair, *waaaaaaaay* more people are going to be familiar with Pokemon than are even going to have ever heard of Ark. That's why
        Ark with Pokémon AND automation. The automation is the biggest part for me
        im glad that most are not familiar with that piece of garbage.
        Yes. This. I played Ark a LONG ass time ago, when it was still in the very beginning Early Access. 


Played Palworld last night, exactly the same but cuter and less clunky (remember my frame of reference was the very beginning of ARK)


I still enjoy it though, far more than Ark. (Plus install size is better, and it's not..built the way..however the fuck the ARK devs write their code lmfao)
    Ark already has Pokémon.

They're dinosaurs.
        You're getting downvoted, but you're effectively correct. From the large variety of creatures to having pocket sized dinosaur holding balls.
            Fire Wyvern used flamethrower. Enemy Dodo fainted.
            Those dinosaurs can't farm, mine, log, and build equipment and structures for me while I go catch more though, soooooooo.
                Well, some can, but that's kind of moot because they can't do that in Pokemon either.
        And the 3d models in ark probably weren't stolen from 3d Pokémon games.

Considering what some people have shown.
        Ark has the horrible shitty breeding mini game system of Pokemon dialed up to 100000....

Cause it actually takes hours in real life to hatch an egg just too find out the IVs 🤣🤣🤣🤣
    The only pokemon game it’s similar too is Legends Arceus because of the incentive to capture multiples of the same pals but that’s about as far as the gameplay similarities go
        Arceus also has some bare bones gathering and crafting. The bosses in each are very similarly done too.
        Basically what I wanted Legends Arceus to be, except it went a little too far into the survival crafting mechanic. But I'm really enjoying it!
        You mean other than the overtly similar if not identical characters in terms of physiology. Only differences between colors used. lol
    I think the same thing, it's more of an Ark style game then Pokemon. Instead of dinosaurs you have the Pal's. You have the entire leveling system that is similar to Ark (unless it changed from when I used to play).  I haven't played Palworld but there is probably more similar things. 

It's Ark with cute monsters that you can make them automate (work) for you.
        Also quite importantly, Palworld feels far more casual friendly and I mean that in the best possible way. It's just far more forgiving and fun to the average player.
            I was tempted to buy it, not for the Pokemon (been a fan since 5 years old) feel but more because it gave me Ark vibes. I wanted to feel that first time playing Ark feeling again. Seeing a dodo for the first time and taming it but it being a Pal in this case.

But back to your point, it does feel and look more casual, that's why I was tempted to play it but then I got turned off with the real time egg hatching mechanics but then found out at a later date you can change these sorts of settings. Letting players change this will bring in a lot more casual play.
                Yeah although those settings could use some work. For example, say you wanted to reduce  egg incubation times, they can be set to half at the 2nd lowest setting or have no incubation time at all iirc.
                So Ive plopped about 8hrs into it, and while i have found a few eggs, I havent even gotten to the incubation part, but thats (so far) not a large part of collecting pals.   I think (I barely played it, and forever ago) Ark puts a massive amount of 'game time' into eggs / breeding that Palworld does not.
    yeah that’s just the media being its typical buzz word annoying ass. There’s a couple pals that have abilities with a cooldown that either use guns or the pal turns kinda into a gun but that’s a minor aspect to the game. The best part is hunting for pals that have better work suitability for your base
    Really looks like “Chibi ark” to me
    >Ark with Pokemon

Which was already a mod!
    Its super misleading.  Idk who came up with that shit.
    You could be on to something there.
    >People going in thinking it is more of a Pokemon game are being misled imo.

It was actually the developer who described it that way.  Which is a huge red flag for me.
    I dont think it helps that most of their promotional materials feature pals with guns over base progression and pal slavery. + Pokemon has penetrated the minds of gamers so much its hard to not immediately associate it with Pokemon over Ark. Open world sandbox isn't special, we have Ark, Minecraft, Valheim bit of Stardew Valley, Satisfactory, it's a saturated genre but tiny cute monsters in the wild? Thats pokemon
    "Pokemon with guns! You can have slaves!"

That shit needs to go away imo

 
I was entirely gonna skip it due to how cringe this sounds, but some of the recent clips and what not made me get it. I'm super thankful it isn't as crazy cringe as I thought it was going to be. Aside from the goofy catching/eating stuff. It's a great game that has a future
It's *aesthetically* similar to pokemon, but the gameplay has nearly nothing in common.

Edit: y’all don’t seem to understand - “you catch monsters in balls” isn’t gameplay, it’s dressing around the gameplay. The actual gameplay of this game is 3rd person shooting with base building and crafting. I was told this is “Pokémon with guns” and was pretty disappointed to find it plays nothing like Pokémon (though I’m really enjoying the game anyway!)
    > but the gameplay has nearly nothing in common.

i mean... have you ever seen Pikachu holding a UZI in ash shoulder?

or have a birb shit explosive eggs.
        I've seen a plant shoot exploding eggs on pokemon, does that count?
        Bombirdier is a thing now. But it's a stork dropping stuff from its beak rather than shitting.
    Comparing palworld with pokemon because "you have balls and catch monsters" is like comparing palworld with doom. "you have guns and shoot monsters"
        What other games use balls to catch monsters?
            How does it matter? Temten with cards to catch monsters is more like pokemon then palworld with balls. Thats the point.
                well temtem is a clone of pokemon (and a mediocre one at best), this takes an aspect of pokemon, that other games, including ark, took when enough years passed to get away with it.

while also almost certainly taking pokemon assets and morphing and mixing them into new shapes and definitely taking pokemon textures and slapping those onto new models (which in turn are at times also taken from other places, like the totoro one).

they didnt just copy the design philosophy and gave it their own spin.
                    \> they didnt just copy the design philosophy and gave it their own spin.

Right, its just an additional game mechanic introduced to valheim philosophy. thats the point. The pokemon (maingames) philosophy has much more then just catching funny monsters with balls. everything besides that is missing.

idk whenever i read people comparing it to a pokemon game it feels like they never played a pokemon game before. Its confusing.
                Because saying the comparison isn’t valid while it’s literally the only game with that exact system makes it a fair comparison to say it’s like Pokémon mixed with arc. It’s not as simple as “doom shoots monsters” when there’s literally thousands of games that shoot monsters but like 1 that captures monsters in balls n shit lol
        but its more like mario land, you can jump !
    Yeah. I mean, sure, you have to fight to weaken cute animal-like monst... creatures, and throw a ball at them to catch... sorry, *capture* them. And then you carry them around in your pocket. Then you can rename them, and teach them more abilities. For some, you have to use even more advanced capture balls. And you have to capture very specific types in order to perform very specific tasks, like riding them, or putting out fires.




*Gotta capture all of them!*
        They're probably talking about how main line pokemon games feature turn based combat with a strength and weakness system
            The creatures and moves have types. So far, I've seen normal, dark, grass, and dragon in the first 3 hours.
        Again - lots of surface-level similarities. But the actual moment to moment gameplay is nothing like traditional turn-based Pokémon. 
    You catch monsters in balls evel them up and fight them. That's a fairly big similarity. But yeah they've also tacked on the survival aspects. 

Very addictive combo if you ask me.
        Maybe I didn't play long enough, but your comparison is pretty shallow. Yes, you collect monsters and fight them. But it's mostly you doing the fighting while your pet autoattacks randomly. I didn't see any way to command the pet or teach it specific things. It levels up by doing non combat shit like chopping trees at your base.

The core of the combat is in no way similar to the turn based combat from the Pokémon franchise.
            >But it's mostly you doing the fighting while your pet autoattacks randomly.

Except they deal significantly more damage and are better at fighting than you.

Even thugs if you capture them 

>I didn't see any way to command the pet or teach it specific things

What are you talking about 
There are literally skill fruits that work JUST like TMs do

>It levels up by doing non combat shit like chopping trees at your base.

You mean....like PLA did when you were doing things like gathering and stealth catching awarding relatively minor amounts of exp? 

>The core of the combat is in no way similar to the turn based combat from the Pokémon franchise.

Pst, pokemon SV literally has an auto battle function, which while not going through individual attacks like PW, is the same basic thing.
                I'll have to take your word for it. I played the game 30 minutes and uninstalled. 

I like the turn based combat of Pokémon, and I have zero interest in base building, survival, and crafting mechanics. 

It's just not a game for me.
                    a moment of silence for the men and women who got scammed by everybody saying "its pokemon with guns" 

RIP your 30$ friend
            It's not "exactly" the same but its pretty damn similar. And yes you can teach moves and command them, but it's not turn based. That's the difference. Iirc some of the more recent Pokémon games have ditched the turned based combat as well...
                Pokémon is turn based, none of the recent games have removed that. At most Legends: Arceus had a slightly modified turn order (not strict 1 turn per Pokémon, it depended on speed), but it was still turn based. 

And the Pals in Palworld aren’t able to be controlled beyond picking skills or using specific active skills (like turning Foxparks into a flamethrower that the player wields). Palworld is definitely more of a normal action combat game than it is Pokémon.
                    Well if you are on a mount you get full control over the pal's moves but I get your point. 

Aside from the battling though, collecting the pals, levelling them up, etc it's got a lot in common with Pokémon. I would even argue this is closer to where Pokémon should be these days if game freak weren't so hell bent on holding it back.
                        Moving away from turned-based would be a big FU to the competitive scene.
                            Their recent work has been a big FU to the entire scene over and over again for decades really though hasn't it.

Edit: downvoted eh. We just gonna act like the Pokémon games are good these days? Lol
                                I've enjoyed VGC in this gen significantly more than the last one, probably more than gen 6 as well.
From what I gather it's basically Ark with Pokémon instead of Dinos and Fortnight aesthetic.
I agree I dont think there's anything wrong with it. 

What I will say, is that all these type of base building survival games have a particular aesthetic that makes them look janky compared to a standard shooter etc. 

I just assume it's the nature of making this type of game because I'm yet to see one that doesn't.
    Yeah it kinda reminded me of Fortnite...
Pal pathing is really janky. I'm getting tired of my pals in base getting hungry/injured/knocked out cus they randomly stuck behind my walls or on top of some structure. It happens all the time, more and bigger pals you get, the worse it is.

And you start building stuff in your base more and more, their pathing gets really weird and they start doing some back and forward movement when they cant find a path. Even tho there is decent gaps they just dont want to go through that and instead travel around the world to get to the point.

Also pals following me randomly get stuck or just stop and stare into nothingness for no reason. 

And im trying to capture a pal, but it fails so it "flies" inside a cliff or anything that is nearby and gets stuck.

Also perma combat is a thing..


But its still a good game, definiately has janky bugs.
    The pal pathing is so bad, I started building a second base in a big flat patch just to try and give my pals a place they can actually get around in.  My first base is on a hill and it breaks their brains
    Ai in general is pretty bad tbh
Definetly not rust but Ark yes
    > Definetly not rust

I imagine that one big difference is fewer nakeds, lol.
        😂 yes thankfully 
I'm glad to see reasonable and grounded answers at the top here. On Twitter it is insane how many Pokeman fans with fucking Stockholm syndrome are down right frothing at the mouth that this game has been so successful lol. Literally grasping at the most hilarious straws and wild claims that this game violates copyright laws to find any flaws with it, as if Game Freak games are the pinnacle of fine craftsmanship hahahahaha....
    the last good pokemon game was black/white maybe with this gamefreaks can finally shut off auto pilot mode but I doubt it less effort means more money.
    Hopefully, this game will be the end of Gamefreak.
        >Hopefully, this game will be the end of Gamefreak.

PW while fun isn't pokemon.


Not will it even scratch the paint of pokemon's success or sales 

Pokemon SV was pretty widely assumed it was going to be trash due to all the problems with PLA and SWSH, it still sold 23.23 million copies
        If you honestly think that, you don’t really understand just how much Pokémon games sell.
My son described it as Pokémon Ark! Sounds awesome.
Unsure what conclusion you're drawing here but Ark and rust are extremely successful titles, so... palworld good?
The bugs are hilarious. You can fly by standing on a capture sphere. The human enemies are coded like Pals so you can catch them. If I pick up my sheep and put him down in certain places he glitches through the ground.
    humans being caught is not a bug, though.
>I don't think the game is very janky, it felt fine to me.

There is definitely jank in how the pals operate in battle and inside the base. I've had pals just sit there and get killed by other pals without fighting back or pals that simply refuse to go eat out of a full food box and starve to death.
I would say it's like Ark, Valheim and Pokemon had a baby
    Replace Valheim with fortnite and zelda and you would be spot on.
Everyone heard "Pokémon with guns" and lost their mind when it's really just another lame survival/base builder game with a really lame pet gimmick laid on top.
    I mean it’s still pretty fun, I’m assuming you haven’t touched it because it goes pretty in depth. If people weren’t having fun it wouldn’t be selling this much, considering from what I’ve seen the majority didn’t even know it was coming, they just heard about it after it launched and blew up fast. My little brother saw it and wish-listed it on Steam almost 2 years ago now lol
Would you say that there is more or less jank than in ark ?
    Compared to when vanilla ark released, Palworld is amazing. But given how much content and development and mods have added to ark, Palworld isn’t close yet.
Also isn’t the game in early access? Obviously that isn’t an excuse if the game was literally unplayable with loads of bugs but that isn’t the case from what I’ve played.
    It is early access.

It literally is an excuse.

It is week 1 of early access.
14 days from this comment, there will be a slew of "gaming journalists" writing a post to meet the deadline with a title like "Palworld has lost 90% of its audience"

This clickbait title gets engagement from those that dislike the game, and those who want to defend the game. Thing is, 10% of 1 million is 100K, which is still very respectable numbers, but yet the click-starved journalist looking to keep their job will write the article all the same.
    Yea. There’s almost no way any game can retain this high a player base. Everyone is curious and trying it out because of the hype. Which is great. and if the devs can maintain it and improve it where it needs improvement then it will be a long lasting healthy game.

And yes. It will lose the vast majority of its players and people will point at the big numbers and act like it’s a big deal and some kind of failure.

But in reality a game that gains 50,000 players from the start and maintains 90% of its player base is a success.
A game that gains 1 million from the start and loses 90% of its players is a much bigger success.

BUT it gets painted as a failure because people don’t understand numbers and journalists capitalize on ignorance.
        Unless the devs are working quickly, it's unlikely Palworld will see more than a bugfix in the next few weeks. It doesn't have a very in-depth story. It doesn't have the rush of PvP. Unlike live-service games, the pals don't need to be fed. You can leave forever and come back eventually. And that's what people are going to do. Like No Man's Sky, the devs can boost their sales with future expansions later this year, but in-between, the numbers will dive as the novelty wears off and the annoyances stack up. Nothing new.
            The strange expectations for a non online service game to maintain its population is the crazier thing.
                Yep, the obsession with steam numbers on a non always-online live service game is tiring. Not to mention that Palworld will have a dedicated modding scene since Pokemon modding has been on overdrive since the 2010s. Apparently there's already a Pokemon overhaul mod.
                    Holy, you opened eyes, if this game get good a good modding scene it may live forever.


Like, just new Mod pals would already be big


There's a gold mine here
                        New mod pals plus modders can go ham with whatever they want to add since Palworld itself isn't restricted to one genre unlike other games. For all we know there's mods expanding pal combat while there are mods expanding the fps mechanic or mods expanding the automation side while all looking good. That's the great positive of using a modern engine like Unreal Engine 5.

And it's funny that there's already a [Pokemon replacement mod](https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1749381513001767167)  , so if they can do that what's stopping them from adding gym/elite 4 npcs and you get to fight their pokemons in real time at the towers instead of being static like the mainline games.

Ideas so good I can feel the copyright strikes even before it's publicly released. That's how this game lives on even if devs abandon it.
                            Add full modsupport and they will sell 10mill

There would be full pokemon mods within a week
    That's exactly how many people play BG3 on average now. Journalists who would choose this POV would be fooling themselves.
    Player count is absolutely meaningless. I've played niche online shooters with a player count of around 100 and I had no trouble finding full matches.
        Player count matters when you expect content and updates. Game has to make money to get developed.
        Weird take.
    Game loses 1 player (dude actually went to sleep) every youtuber and gaming journalist: PALWOLRD IS DEAD
    "this startling trend"
        # Avid film critic watches Goodfellas 10 times, then doesn't watch it for 2 years. Are critics getting burned out of gangster movies?

Comments (133)

* Yeah Goodfellas had some great commentary on second-generation working-class Italians looking to stake their claim in America, but it did feel a little choppy.
   * And as much as I loved the film on release, the blood effects look dated after 30 years.
      * Are you joking dude? When \[major spoiler\] gets shot in the head it was so realistic compared to the CGI crap we have today.
   * The ending felt rushed. Couldn't the script writers have worked longer before they released it?
* I love gangster movies and will buy the steelbook as soon as it goes on sale.
* Unpopular opinion: after 80 years of gangster movies, I'm kind of over them.
   * Agreed. Can we get some more superhero films? I remember back in the day those were so fun to watch. Great times.
      * bro the Dark Knight in theaters was wildddd
      * Ew, gross.
   * no youre good, I feel alot of the same way. Bang BANG rob steal woop de doo...
   * Another "unpopular opinion" that is actually popular.
* Goodfellas made 47 million in the box office which is way less than I thought. Seems like people were burned out of gangster movies back then too.
   * i can see why. it was going up against Ghost which is an objectively better story.
      * The theater went wild for \[major spoiler\]. Like who would choose some boring shoot 'em up over that?
      * "Ghost" was peak. I remember playing that so many times on my dad's VCR. I didn't even understand it!
   * You're crazy. Adjusted for inflation that's almost $111,000,000 today which is *very* good for its time. y'all are just hating.
* Playing this kind of post-WWII drama was important for my childhood.
   * Did you know that Hitler influenced a joke in one scene? \[40 minute YouTube Video\]
   * ya man, what's the dislike? They don't make movies like they used to.

Yadda yadda, same old stuff, it writes itself.
            LOL .... goodfellas is one of the few movies - along with pulp fiction and a few others that I would always watch if I hit on it while channel surfing.

[edikt: numerous spelling fixes]
    Yup, this is the sad state of the video game world online. People who like a game just quietly keep playing it but people who dislike it, especially a popular one, want validation for their dislike and seek that out and that’s who articles get written for. It’s so fucking negative and it really makes me feel gross
Once they bring in Workshop/Mod support, the game will resurge for a while, but that's not on the map till after launch from what I've read. But at least it's been mentioned. I'm hoping the devs don't do what they've done to Craftopia (slow small updates, not much content added from what I've been told by friends who have played it). I'm hoping the 3mil+ copies sold will be able to keep them working on the game for a couple years seriously instead of having the focus shifted to whatever the next project is.
    Honestly the devs could do nothing but add steam workshop support and the game would be thriving in a year
Yah there just isn't enough content. Everything is very basic right now. I think it will fizzle in a few weeks followed by a resurgence as they hopefully release new content. More pals. More bosses. More base building designs. 

I think it's up to the developer how far they want the game to go. They could probably take their bag and leave if they wanted.
TBF, that's pretty much every game though. Players the following month is always significantly lower than the players on release.
I'll take a bet on that and say there wont be a decline in 3 weeks, I'll bet on a steady growth for at least the next 4 months.

Bet?
    I would but I don’t really care.
        Neither do I but was curious to see who'd call it.
> Temtem

Microtransactions awaaaaay! At least Palworld is a $30 game you get for $30, forever.
    Temtem shot itself by trying to be an MMO without offering enough of a draw to be able to maintain a player base.
        Temtem shot itself by making the game annoying to play so they could sell convenience in the cash shop.
            I mean that's exactly what I said. The grind that can be skipped with microtransactions is the most MMO thing. 

And honestly they could have skipped that. By giving it MMO aspects they basically increased their own running costs as it meant they had to maintain servers for running the game. If they had just kept it as a modest pokemon clone they wouldn't need to try and do battle passes.
                It could have still been massively multiplayer. A Pokémon clone with a persistent overworld and some pvp / co-op elements seemed to be what they were going for. But MMOs don't inherently need to be evil, they just benefit a lot from it.

Personally I think the private server route is better for games like this and Minecraft.
                That is just straight up wrong. Microtransactions don't give you any game advantages or "skip the grind" as you called it. They are purely cosmetic.
    Temtem has left a bad taste in my mouth ever since r/theperfectpokemongame would not stop talking about it. I am certain that a significant number of posts about that game were posted by the developers. It does not surprise me at all that it's full of microtransactions. 

The "perfect Pokemon game" at a minimum should have Pokemon in it. If it's not got Pokemon, it's not a Pokemon game.  

That said, Palworld is a great *creature collecting game* and I'm enjoying it more than any of the recent releases from Pokemon! I just wish Gamefreak would release something that is closer to this so that I can enjoy the Pokemon IP again.
    > At least Palworld is a $30 game you get for $30, forever.

Awfully confident that they won't add micro-transactions down the road. Wouldn't be the first time.
        Ah true, they could add crap later. I doubt they'd add a cosmetics/convenience store though, because the game has self hosted server infrastructure and custom settings for difficulty (and locally stored saves). You can't sell people cheat codes like EXP boosters when they could just hex-edit a locally saved file or play the game with "exp rate" set to 20x.

Most likely, there'd be paid DLC. Worst case, there's paid cosmetics (which would absolutely be a cash grab and betrayal of the audience).
            Ark added paid dlc expansions before releasing the original game out of early access lol

How did the developers previous game go?


Edit - just checked. Still in early access.
>Cassette Beasts

Cassette beasts is the clear king of the genre right now in my mind. It definitely recaptured the magic for me without being a straight derivative and I was surprised how much I liked the writing and creature designs.

Plus that soundtrack. Good lord.
    Yeah I'm super surprised Cassette Beasts didn't even get a fraction of the Pokemon community hype Palworld is getting.

It's way closer to pokemon than Palworld while still feeling fresh and unique (plus, the designs are unique and not reused pokemon assets like palworld lol).
I like to think the game is a more immersive version of what the Pokemon world would of been like before any of the towns and routes were developed, plus guns and some high tech stuff.
    It looks to me like if Legends: Arceus was more than a tech demo

In the show Pokémon help build things right? Makes sense you'd have them working in a small town etc
I also recommend Cassette Beasts, fantastic game
I compare it more to age of Conan. A slave is a slave, whether I raided a town for them or threw a pokimans balls at them.
Cassette beasts is amazing and even had a built in randomizer, although I wouldn’t recommend it for a first playthrough as it’s incredibly unbalanced
Is it the good part of ark? Or the ones like grinding tons of hours for a door
    [deleted]
        Basic materials like wood and stone are plentiful yeah, but I feel like crafting ammo or anything else that requires ingots gets very grindy. Doesn't help that it's so heavy that you keep having to run home and drop the ore off so often.
            True. What helps is a second base at an iron spot and let pals do the work of gathering that stuff into a chest next to your palbox. Pick up all, teleport to main Base, unpack into chest next to your palbox there. Done.
                Yup. You unlock the second base just in time to start needing tons of iron. It's pretty clear they intended it to be a mining base.
                    And the pals doing work for you, somebody definitely got tired of having to do everything themselves in ark.
                        I haven't played ark but i could understand that from other survival games. The automation is so nice to have.
                            I especially love how organic it is. No need to micromanage. The pals can be specifically instructed, or left to their own devices, and they get shit *done*.
                                Except the fuckin penguin and fox keep leaving their posts. I NEED THAT FRIDGE COLD AND MY INGOTS HOT DAMMIT WHY DID YOU TELEPORT ONTO THE BATTLEMENT
                    And you get a third base the moment you start to get the next ingot, so yeah, secondary bases are meant to be gathering.
                    Oh thank god I was wondering how I was going to manage ore
                    Can your bases get raided while you are not there?  
Will walls help or does the enemy just destroy them?  
what do sand bags actually do?
                It's actually worth smelting it in the same place you farm it and then just move the ingots (as they weigh less and you get more space for crafting in your main base). 4 pals with level 3 mining can get more than 8 deposits before they respawn. So there is plenty of space for 2 carriers and two/three smelters.
                    This guy palworlds!
                        Or Factorio'es. Or Satisfactories.
                Yep, and I already have 2 or 3 spots marked on my map as candidates for the second base for iron.
                What I really loved in Pal World that they did, and most times I would need a mod for such features is:

1) Being able to teleport/fast travel while over encumbered (while still being able to move)

2) Crafting stations take resources from chests.

I always assumed I would need the resources on me to craft, like so many other games. Didnt realize until later that it pulled resources from chests within the base boundary. I'm sure other games have done this, but just from the few that i've played it always require resources on your character.

I'm only about 7hrs in, playing solo and absolutely loving the game so far.
                Am I missing something? I built a base right among a bunch of iron and put some depressos down but they’re not touching them. Can’t figure it out.
            There are a fair number of spots with 4+ ore spots around. Once you unlock a second base, build one there and fill it up with Pals with the Mining lvl. 2+ ability, a few pals with transporting and some basic food production. The only chest should be built right next to the pal station.  
The mining pals will continuously mine the ore while the transporters gather it in the chest. Every once in a while you can teleport there, grab the ore and teleport back to your main base. Doesn't matter if you can't move with all the ore, as teleporting is still possible and in your base you can leapfrog the ore by dropping it, moving towards the closest chest and picking it up again.
            The weight is mostly why putting most of your level points into weight is the way to go. Not really a reason to use the points on attack since it increases it by like 2 and your digimons are usually the ones doing the damage
                Or you could just make a grappling hook.

No matter how over encumbered you are you can always use the grappling hook so its easy to move around huge amounts of stuff via your palbox teleport.
                You could use pals with weight increase passive for carrying(starting spots cats have it). I put like 3-4 points into carry weight but I feel like stamina and hp are better investment of points.
            I built my second run base literally in an area with like ten iron deposits in a ring, way up on a mountain too so I can glide to wherever.

Best decision as wood/stone I can generate infinite of, if my fucking foxpark would stop being fucking lazy I'm easily hitting like a thousand ingots in barely any time. Sucks he's bugged out but has the slacker debuff.

I purposefully got two miner skill and two logging skills to give me resources so I usually have a few hundred when I come back + my game bugged out really hard so I have six pals at my base doing everything but they're not actually at my base and don't lose hunger/motivation at all. They're just churning out resources like crazy and taking the occasional break.

Then I have my regular pals that I can actually interact with and they're churning out other stuff.

Plus my mate made a big house but he doesn't know if you crawl up a wall until you hit the ceiling you teleport into the room above you. I've been stealing shit from his locked house to fuck with him for the last two days and then escaping out the roof because he built a big overhang into his second floor.
    People played ark without tuning the numbers?
        Ark looked like a second job to me
            That's because ARK IS a second job. 

We had a group of friends all playing together, had a nice base, a bunch of nice dinosaurs, good gear, a nice farm, everything. 

We had all played hard this day, did a lot of work caught a bunch of dinos and everything, what one could call a hard days day of work. So at some point we call it a night and we all crawl into our beds, dead tired from the hard work of the day, well almost all of us. The one player that loved the farming stayed around, she's going around taking care of the farms and grabbing eggs. Thirty minutes-an hour go by and she starts hearing noises outside the base, she goes and checks it out and notices a few players sneaking around our base, she soon finds out that they are raiders, CHINESE RAIDERS! So she being outnumbered and the least PvP confident and least PvP experience player in our group panicks. She jumps on discord voice calling everyone to try to get some help (I think it might have been Skype at the time.), but no help is coming as everyone else is sleeping from their hard day of play/work. So she ends up just hiding there and watching this group of raiders destroy our base and kill our dinos.

6-8-10 hours later as the rest of the group wakes up, they notice the dozens of panicked calls for help, they all quickly jump on the game to witness the aftermath of the devastation with their own eyes and is baaad. There are a few dinos that are somehow still alive, maybe they were set to passive or something and the raiders didn't feel like wasting time killing them, but these are the lower level ones or ones without great stats, used for eggs or manure. Apart from these not good dinos a couple of walls here and there and a few boxes with stone or wood, everything else is gone.

So what is the point of this story? Well I guess you aren't allowed to have any off time from the game and if you do dare to take some time off you better have someone to stay and guard around the clock AND make sure everyone is reachable on their phone at all times so you can come in for emergency wor..I mean play during the weekends.
                That sounds miserable
        Literally that, it looks so awful to play it without atleast x10 loot and honestly i prefer even higher
        there are people that actually play ark on official servers where it has the default config...

Some people are really masochist in playing a survival game where GRIND is really fucking slow.
    That's the best part Pokemon sweatshops, they'll do all the work for you!
    The good parts.

There's a grind, but its minutes instead of hours.

The pals can actually do a lot of the grinding for you with the right upgrades. Automation back at base grinding up basic resources and crafting stuff like ammo while you go do the fun part.

Big pal eggs take a couple hours to hatch in an incubator, but you aint waiting *days* to only have a baby starve to death because your maewing decided "nah fuck this one".

Its rough, but its a *great* start. Lots of promise.
        What I get from Palworld is that the base, the core, it's already built, there's a solid great stuff here with this direction.


They just need to improve it


 But as a early access, this sold the idea really well 
            From early looks its one of the most complete gameplay experiences that has entered "early access" in recent memory.
    Grind can become almost non-existent fairly early on since you can automate practically everything with Pals
        The power of outsourcing labour
    I tried out Palworld, it wasn't for me but it did have world setting options where you could jack up the material drop rates to insane degrees so that instead of hitting a tree for 45 seconds it was like, two punches to make a workbench. There are a *lot* of options to customize how much "grind" the game has.

Edit: a friend bought me the game as a gift after I refunded it. It hooked me this time. No regrets
    Ark with the bad bits thrown out. 
You get plenty of resources from the trees/rocks and the basic buildings require a totally reasonable amount of wood/stone i.e hit a tree once or twice and you can make a wall instead of needing the entire tree
    The grind is nowhere near ark levels. Plus your little pals can do some of the grinding for you passively.
    The nice part is that crafting can be automated so not as grindy as ark
I liked the idea of ark but my 2fps and 30min timer till crash made me not like it.
    And also the 250gb storage usage
If I've never even heard of Ark until now but loved pokemon as a kid, I'm still tempted to go in blind.

Should I look up Ark gameplay to fill in this puzzle piece or are there many types of Ark gameplay?
    The Ark part is very important  
Because this game is nothing like Pokemon  
Whereas Pokemon is a JRPG through and through, Palworld is a crafting focused survival game  
They're not even the same genre of game
    Nah, once you work out the controls it explains it fine. Catch Pals, level up, unlock things in your skill tree, repeat.

Pretty fun loop actually, I was shocked by it.
        The fun part is leveling is tied to capturing pals so you only worry about the part of making balls on your Chinese Sweatshop.

so you will still have some use for those pals that you ~~enslave~~ capture.
    Ark is extremely grindy. Like "my breeding is done in 6 hours and I need to be on in 6 hours or i wasted 26 hours" type shit. 

Palworld is grindy but more enjoyable in my opinion. Like others said, there's jank but it's a lot more fun. As for the pokemon aspect it's more like acreus than pokemon white. 

Rarely will you be thinking "what do I do now?" You have a clear set of goals through a majority and as soon as you load into the game it's mechanics are clear. Being honest it does a pretty good job of teaching you everything.

And remember you get 2 hours to play, you can just refund if you don't like it. I'm quite a bit of hours in and I find it extremely enjoyable, lots to do , lore , good flair for attacks.
        I'd like to add that Ark is only that grindy if you play on the official settings/servers, which isn't recommended by most players from my experience, unofficial servers and solo play offer a lot more reasonable grind rates.
            I've always avoided Ark because it seems too daunting. Is solo ark reasonable to do and enjoy (with said changed settings)? I've endured solo Valheim and loved it solo.
                Its not bad, but the big problem with Ark is the performance and file size optimization. Last I checked the whole install with DLC is well over 200GB, I had to manually run some windows file compacter tool to bring it down by more than half, and there was no performance impact from that.
                Solo or multi is not the real problem, pve is, last time i played the game it was absolutely not designed or balanced for it, its fine early on, but when it gets bad it does so extremely fast, it also has tons of time wasting, time sensitive mechanics designed to keep you online, its not quite as bad on singleplayer but they are still there.
            Not to mention you can re-tune the values everytime you join the game you created (well, solo anyway). So no worries if you over or undertuned some values (looking at you V Rising).
        Gamespass would be the better trial imo cause then you get the catalog of everything else you can play for the month if not (plus intro price of like $1) yes am aware is behind the steam version but update is planned from what I've heard and I haven't had any issues with it yet
            Highly recommend this approach for people who aren't familiar with this type of game and assume this is just like Pokemon  
I tested it last night on Game Pass and decided the survival nature of it is just not for me
                You can tweak that as well down to like 0 or almost 0 which should help some but yea enough not like Pokemon that don't think it's just Pokemon
    I enjoyed Ark by heavily adjusting settings, I don't have time to play on official servers with legit settings. I hosted a server for a few friends, where we cranked the settings in our favour and it was a lot of fun.

I've wanted to try single player, but it doesn't seem as interesting for me anyways.

I think Ark is okay to go in blind, but you'll definitely be Googling some wikis as you go along.
This is the kind of jank that makes the game funner. I do think it’ll die down a bit, but the players who stop will have most likely already sunk 30 or 40 hours into the game so is it a really a failure? That much gameplay for something priced so low. From then on there will be waves of players returning everytime we get an update
What’s the gameplay loop of Ark?
    Grind > Die > Grind > Die
I guess you could say it's....palatable
Inhaling copium = people are very excited about a new game they enjoy and want to share their positivity about it
    No he meant the opposite, the people who think the game is only popular now because of the hype and will die in early access once the hype is gone
        Ah I see I see, I actually purchased it after I made that comment and just played for about 5 hours straight with a friend, was not expecting to enjoy it that much
That's a glitch that I've seen used to travel large distances
    You can also one shot bosses with it if you time it right
        What is it, throwing one when they are too high hp to be caught?
How old are your kids? Looking for a new game to play with my 7yo daughter.
    There’s guns and violence, but no blood/gore. There are some things like the pals crying when you’re fighting them, or if you treat them poorly in your base that a child may find disturbing. There’s also paldeck/Pokédex descriptions that describe certain pals being used for execution.
        Well, there's also the Butcher's Knife item that lets you butcher Pals that you've caught. My 9-year-old can't decide if he finds that disturbing or hilarious, but that's kind of the human condition, I guess. Nothing else in the game is nearly that disturbing, but it's a great platform for talking to your kids about how we treat animals in the real world, for better or worse.

edit: You can also capture "bad guys" and use them for your bidding, which is a little weird and might also be a bit unsettling depending. I feel like 7 is old enough to understand most of what's going on, but you might need to talk them through some things occasionally.
            > My 9-year-old can't decide if he finds that disturbing or hilarious

I'm 31 and same
            Just a heads-up, though you're unlikely to try yourself, uless you're really curious. You can butcher anything in a pal sphere, and anything in A pal sphere is considered a pal.


 Ergo you can use the butcher knife in humans, so avoid that lol
                I wondered. Thank you for filling in that gap in my knowledge. xD
        Honestly, it's about as violent as Fortnite. If you think that's not appropriate for your kids, then this isn't either.
            It's weird. Having kids has made me way less judgmental toward other parents about almost everything, but as a game enjoyer, I am incredibly vigilant about my son's games and am surprised at what other parents allow.

It's not like my parents who didn't really understand games and ended up not doing much about it (basically the era that birthed the ESRB). 

Rather, I know exactly how addictive games can be and how much time (and ambition) they can suck up. I want him to enjoy games that enable his creativity and abilities, rather than stifling them. 

And that's not even addressing the content discussion. I saw what happened when our nephew was allowed to play games like Call of Duty at 5 or 6. The poor kid is a desensitized drone, and I think it's in no small part due to his mom allowing completely unmonitored/unrestricted gaming time. 

To be clear, I think this aspect is a symptom of their greater (lack of) parenting issues, but he's also never been given the privilege of getting to know who he is without a game to sink hours into.

Sorry. I don't know what about your comment sparked my gaming dad soapbox moment, but I hope somebody got something out of it.
        Also y'know, the human slavery. And the 69th entry in the paldex (edit:  legitimately they made a pal whose thing is "it has breasts and wants to make love with everything" and made it number 69)
            Important to note that this specific Pal was actually going to be a different number at first, 49 I've heard. They changed it because of a suggestion for it to be 69 on their discord, which makes them good devs who have spent time listening to fans somewhat.
                >  which makes them good devs who have spent time listening to fans somewhat.

I can't work out if this is sarcastic as hearing this aspect just made me groan in annoyance even harder that the devs chose to cater to people who need to touch grass.
    The writing tries kinda hard to have an edge to it, but I don't think its so bad you wouldn't let her play it. The only real problem is that edginess extends to the pal descriptions in the Paldeck where they describe the Pals ripping the skin off in public executions or non-consensually mating with humans.
        One of the first Pals has a description that says it's got the mental capacity of a human 5 to 7 year old, which is great up until they started figuring out how to use weapons and killed their trainers.
    My Pal called Depresso was hungry and the in game text said "*the lazy bastard is sleepy*". 

Gameplay is fine for kids but there is stuff like the above text in it.

In Europe its pending PEGI 12 (12 and above ages). In the US I would say it will be 16 and above as US ratings tend to be more strict when it comes to bad language vs Europe where ages 12 and up are fine for bad language and its only 16 and up if the language is sexual or very in your face / over the top.
    Depends, are you in America? 7 yo is good to go on wholesome gun blasting goodness!

Before the NRA sicks their bots on me, seriously just taking the piss lol.
"AI" is now just a generic buzzword like "smart" or "2.0". Marketing firms are using it for everything that utilizes a computer or some form of learning algorithm. Redditors use it to mean "thing I dislike/thing that looks unoriginal".
    When I hear the word AI, I imagine something uninspired lacking cohesion (lacking soul), not what you said. But might be the case of different people, different meanings.
        Problem is AI should not be associated with that. All games with NPCs use some sort of AI but not generative AI.
The AI argument is about the Pal designs as some straight up are mish mashes of existing Pokemon.
    I think we have already other existing games ripping of Pokemon, Pokemon ripped of also other ips and tbh they went lazy with many new designs. What I'm trying to say is it is not enough to put Palworld guys in court most likely.
The janky would be the unrefined systems and control implementations. The game bugs out often while trying to set pals to work is probably the biggest complaint but overall I agree that it packs a lot, for how new the game is, compared to early Ark maps.
    It's also in early access, which many people seem to be forgetting who've shamed this game for having bugs. It has less bugs than some full release games, including Pokémon Scarlet/Violet.
        Man I remember playing Scarlet on release and didn’t have a single bug, not even the memory leak. The game was just hella unoptimized tho. So far palworld is the first paid Early Access game that has felt good to me, but I’ve also just played a lot of shitty early access titles lmao
    fair enough,  yea I got hit through the bottom of the world once and my pals have gotten stuck at the base but usually sort themselves out. Plus one of the pal skills caused my character to sink into the world. But overall I would say it really aint that janky.
>Don't know what all these people are talking about that it is janky?

The Pokemon fanatics with Stockholm syndrome are fucking losing their minds grasping at straws to find any flaws with this game because they are so bizarrely jealous of its viral success. This is what happens when you make inanimate objects and concepts like corporate franchises your entire personality.
    I was wondering the same thing. I have noticed in the past on here that a lot of people crusade for different franchises or really anything they are interested in despite the reality of things. So I thought this may be a similar situation. I grew up with Pokemon and somewhat like the survival genre so I am happy to have something like this come out and do it pretty damn well.
        I can't agree more, and I'm not even really interested in the game! It just makes me happy to see more options and interesting ideas out there.
    i dont even like pokemon and i have many issues with this game.  there are game breaking bugs and its annoying.  but hopefully with some time they are fixed.  good game
    >This is what happens when you make inanimate objects and concepts like corporate franchises your entire personality.


The irony of getting of super defensive about a game and then ending it with this lmao.
        Doing something you said you don’t like (and they weren’t even lmao) is definitely irony, you’re very good at using that word and you should keep doing it
    You really are telling yourself the only people that might criticize the game are Pokemon fans losing their minds out of jealousy, then say they’re the ones too attached to a game?
>One of the better survival games I have played. 


Ive heard this line at least 50 times from friends and coworkers whenever they're trying to get me interested in the new early access turd that just dropped. Palworld won't be any different.
There’s plenty of janky camera stuff if you’re trying to interact with something close and above you (e.g. whittling down Nitewing health in melee), assigning specific tasks to certain Pals requires the weird lift and throw, and there are a lot of issues with Pals at base spawning in the landscape or some other location that blocks them from pathing to tasks, beds, and food.  Aside from that, it’s on par or better than most early access survival games, especially with technical performance
Day one and the crafting stations use the shared boxes is chefs kiss.
The best survival game? Like sure, it does things well, but it doesn't do anything better than any other survival game on the market.
    One of the better survival games does not mean the best. I would say my favorite survival game was Subnautica so far. But I think this has some better aspects than other survival games I have played. Better Graphics than ark S E, Better controller support than most of them, Better combat than say minecraft or no mans sky, more quality of life features than a lot of them. Im sure I can think of more but I think those demonstrate well enough as to why I said it is one of the better ones I have played. Not to say I did not like any of the games I am comparing this game to.
        Even one of the best is far fetched imo. The game does everything good. But is not great at anything.

Graphics are all right but they are not crazy either. Again, well executed but not great per se.

Combat is average, Valheim for example is way more engaging. Again the game execute well but isn't really great at combat.
            “One of the better…”, not *best*, and they said it twice. Just fucking read bro. There’s whole ass South Park episode about people like you.
                Lol. Chill out

You can say whatever you want and bitch on semantic (because it's all you have). The game is average at best for a game of that kind.

It does nothing bad but it does nothing great either.

There's dozens of games that do better in different aspect of it. It is just average at everything.
this is my issue w it. I loved their last game craftopia, but its been in EA for 4 years. They just kept adding content and not fixing shit that was already added. Im refraining from getting Palworld until/if they fully release it.
    I'm of the same mindset. No interest until full release.

That said, Baldurs Gate 3 was in early access for 3 years so I wouldn't judge a game purely by how long it's been in early access.
        Yes, but BG3 eventually released.  This developer now has three games in Early Access, but neither of the first two are even close to a full release.
        Larian had a history of delivering and finishing early access games, this studio has the opposite.
Same. Honestly, I think this is what modern Pokémon should have been by now.
The game *looks* so much better than Pokemon too. It's absolutely insane that gamefreak can release something as beautiful as Pokemon Emerald with timeless sprite art and music, and then with better technology release crap like Pokemon Violet which looks like a PS2 game and has some of the crappiest music I've ever heard (approaching Yu-Gi-Oh! game levels of crappy music). 

Palworld looks pretty crisp and has some nice music. Not perfect, but also not made by a studio as large, rich and experienced as gamefreak.
    because they don’t need to invest a lot into their games. They use the same formula with copy and pasted elements. Boom 10mill+ copies sold. It’s worked for 24+ years, and will continue to work.
        I don't think that's fair. Their early work (especially the first 3 gens) is clearly a labour of love. They put a lot of effort into those games and for the time they were incredible. And gen 3 still holds up in my opinion. 

They've been doing the same formula for a long time now, but it didn't start out that way.
    I wouldn't say it looks all that great. The pals don't fit in with the world style, they and the characters clash with it hard.

I hope somewhere along the way they make the world textures fit the Pals because it really sticks out.

Pokémon Violet doesn't look amazing either (so much pop in and low rez textures) but at least it's consistent.
[deleted]
    Hopefully that team can make good use of their new funds to expand this into something quite special.
        [deleted]
        Let's see, [4 million copies](https://www.pcgamer.com/that-pokemon-with-guns-game-palworld-just-sold-4-million-copies-in-3-days-and-it-isnt-slowing-down/) @ 26.99 dollars = 107.96 million dollars.

They've earned over 100 million dollars in just 4 days, they might be able to:

1. afford better offices/equipment
2. hire more developers
3. build a Scrooge McDuck money vault.
    not that it really matters, but the dev team during development was composed of 50+ people. still a feat tho
I don't like Ark, and I like Palworld. Ark is a buggy unpolished grindfest. Palworld's what I wanted Ark to be like.
    Its funny because pal is in early-early access and it's less jank than Ark. The pals can at least pathfind decently
        It also runs so much better than ark. Ark has lag spikes every minute even on solo, palword has stable 60fps constantly
    Early develoment Ark was also horribly laggy, this game is very smooth in comparison.
    me too i hate ARK with my soul
    My experience with Ark a few years ago was spending multiple hours drugging a small dinosaur, then on my way back to my crappy base watching it get permanently killed by a giant alligator. In the same amount of Palworld I captured like 50 off-brand Pokemon and built two bases, it's more of a fun casual experience.
ARK is shit in general, not really the best comparison.
    It is in fact the best comparison. Just because you do not like Ark does not mean this game isn't similar to Ark.
        True that.

But in terms of gameplay mechanics, isn't both Palworld and Ark similar to other games in the same genre? 

Base building from template structures, resource gathering (berries, stone, wood, smelting ore into ingots, etc.), weapon smithing, boss battling, world exploration, cave spelunking, different biomes, etc.

All these things are also things you can do/find in Valheim for instance.
            The systems for palworld are directly copy-pasted from Ark, they’re not just similar. The level progression is almost identical (level up, get points  to invest in escalating levels of tech, as well as picking small incremental stat upgrades). The monsters all serve a very specific function. The needing to craft specific saddles and harnesses to utilizes the monsters for their economic purpose.

Palworld takes most of its DNA from Ark, but it also has cherry-picked some things that worked in other recent innovative games. I see inspiration from BOTW/genshin, Elden ring, valheim, legends arceus, but this almost feels like an Ark mod with massive QOL inprovements.
What about Valheim?
    Same genre of game. Valheim doesn't have taming, i think though? Which is why I would compare it to Ark.
        Ahh right okay. I haven’t played Ark. Valheim does have farming, but it’s not the focus of the game
Gry komputerowe is Polish for video games. ;-)
    Got em!
From Poland
Agreed, stuff like pal fluid and big pals are the best part of the game.
    "come. Let me show you my pal"
        Now, let me show you my favorite pal.
Id say remove "all" with "aspects of". I love being able to choose what moves my Pokemon have, the combat of BotW is much deeper than this, and a good amount of Arks survival, yes. This game is not THE perfect game, but it sure is doing many things right and is much more enjoyable than I ever thought it was going to be since I first saw the reveal trailer (i never thought I'd even buy it but here we are)
    You can swap around your Pal's abilities in the party menu and you can teach them new ones with skill fruits.
        You mean Devil Fruits. :D
    That's what lacks for me. More stuff and in depth things to do with those Pals. Let me chose between controlling them in combat or let AI do it's thing.

There's a lot of potential to explore on that part, because that's really the aspect that set him appart from other games.

The building system is too simple for me to really invite me spending time in it. 

And there's no real incitive to go out and get other Pals or better pals.
    The combat of botw might be a little bit deeper than palworld but having played hundreds of hours of it, it's not that deep. Most of the complexity was wholly unnecessary to regular gameplay, even on the hardmode.

Botw is a much, MUCH better exploration game and even a better speedrun game than it is a combat game. Totk isn't much better, the only way it truly expanded on combat is through the contraptions and additional map bosses.

Palworld has all of the exploration value botw had, and it's captivated my interest better than totk did, largely just because it's not the same damn map I played the first time. I daresay it does a better job, because shrines were dumb and koroks were a painful waste of your time. Palworld has more enemies to fight, more interesting collectables and points of interest to find, and you unlock advanced movement options quicker than you do in botw.

I think the main thing botw did better was bossfights and towns, and there's only 6 and 7 of those.

"Oh hey look, another bokoblin camp! Yay!"
    >the combat of BotW is much deeper than this

...eh. I can't say I'd agree. BoTW combat in particular is painfully simplistic, even when compared to the Zelda games that came before it nevermind when comparing it to most other modern games.
        Simple and deep can coexist. Its very easy to walk up to an enemy and just swing your sword until they die. But then you learn about perfect dodges and bullet time, which gives some nice depth while staying simple. Then you have the runes, which bombs alone are crazy, as well as shield partying, sneak strikes, head shots, etc that give you so many options to use. Not to mention weapons breaking and dealing critical damage and timing that to throw them for a final burst of damage.

The combat is simple, yes, but the further you delve the deeper it gets. Just look up the crazy combat clips and you'll get what I'm saying. Palworld doesn't have that depth.
            That's a fair assessment in comparison to Pal World, least, though I can't say I really find it any more interesting or engaging than most other modern AAA games.
So is their other game.

Neither is their other game.
    Lots of games go into early access. It’s a bit of a trap now, but it’s often done to secure funding and ensure more development. 

Lots of successful games were built in and stayed in EA up until a release years later. And likewise lots have been abandoned after their game didn’t sell. 

Look to see if they are communicating and updating. Or if not updating at least communicating about updating. 

For my own game we are not going to do EA, but instead continue to update after our intended release. But also have monthly communication about our plans and milestones.
It came out 3 days ago.
I would add that it also has a dash of breath of the wild.
    A dash? The music queue and the UI when you enter a new area is just BOTW designs
It’ll be dead in 2 weeks just like among us and fall guys
This flavour of the month is in the history books forever now as one of the most successful launches ever on Steam, in both sales numbers and most concurrent players.
    I don’t know about that one chief 😂
        As someone who doesn't get it, it objectively is. Achieving 3 million sales in 48 hours and having an active player base of over 1 million on steam is groundbreaking for what was a relatively unknown developer. Even if those numbers crash and burn in say a week.
            Thing is, this game isn’t something people will remember in like 5-10 years. No one in 10 years will be like remember Palword? Good times. No, because it’s a flavor of the month game that doesn’t have longevity. Compare it to something like Minecraft that people talk about to this day. It’s a sudden spike in popularity but I predict it will crash and burn very fast and be forgotten soon.
                Even if that's true, it's still worth to play and enjoy something even for a short period of time. The game is genuine fun and unique imo. Will I be playing it in a month or two? Don't know, but I've already gotten my money's worth (GamePass) and enjoyed my time.
                They will remember it because it’s in the history books now, you can’t look up top purchased game on steam without seeing Palworld
        He’s objectively correct?
        I’m not just making that up… go look

What was janky about it?
    - Crashes/bugs

- limited keybinds (french keyboard have that weird thing where "4" and the "$" symbol are inverted, so I have to type "MAJ+$" to get "4", but it doesn't work in game, I just can't repair buildings)

- Stats balance

- tech points acquisition solo vs multiplayer balance. (basically the whole progression system is janky)

- Pal balance

- NPC's are barebone.

- The texts aren't all there yet (lots of "en text" as descriptions)

- generic UI

- No "exit the game" button, I have to either switch to window mode or kill it with the task manager.
        >Crashes/bugs

Yes

>limited keybinds (french keyboard have that weird thing where "4" and the "$" symbol are inverted, so I have to type "MAJ+$" to get "4", but it doesn't work in game, I just can't repair buildings)

Don't see how that's the game's problem, how about using a normal keyboard.

> Stats balance

You're the one that puts the stat points on the character, so that does sound like skill issue.

> tech points acquisition solo vs multiplayer balance. (basically the whole progression system is janky)

There's not a difference between solo and multiplayer unless the host decides to change it.

> Pal balance

Don't know what you mean with this.

>- NPC's are barebone.

Somewhat yes.

>The texts aren't all there yet (lots of "en text" as descriptions)

Didn't have this problem with the spanish translation so far.

> generic UI

I've seen worse but yes.

>No "exit the game" button, I have to either switch to window mode or kill it with the task manager.

Straight up false. You only need to press ESC and the last option in the menu allows you to exit your save and then exit the game.
Their other game is abandonware but they probably won't abandon this one since it's so popular
    lmao, sure...
If a pal gets stuck you can go to the pal box and recall them then deploy them again.
    That just takes more time than save quitting
[deleted]
    Catching pals is boring because i double tap their face with a shotgun, and they get to 3% hp and i still have 20% catch chance with the ultra sphere and 2x boost from world settings against level 40 pals while being 40 myself. After that im just spamming Spheres for like 5 times, and after using up my 30 spheres i have to grind 20mins for the next 30 again.

I havent played Ark before so i dont know about its taming mechanics, but atleast with pokemon i can get new and better balls pretty much more easily, and the catch rate feels better in that.

To be fair i had a similar problem in legends arceus where i sometimes had to spam a mon with balls.

Also how do you get exp? like 90% of my exp comes from first 10 catches of a specific pal variety so its a pretty fucking big focus on the gameplay loop lmao.

I think ive given the game a fair shot, being at 26 hours now, and using most of my vacation day playing it on a monday.

fuck off
        [deleted]
            Are you actually trolling? Am i just being wooshed really badly? Also you just totally didnt read my response because i already said that i have maxed out the capture rate and it still feels bad. Its about as engaging as actual pokemon catching because you just stand there waiting for the sphere to fail and throw again multiple times in a row in higher levels.

You just sound like a fanboy at this moment because we cant criticize your beloved pokemon killer or some shit like that.

I played the game and said what i feel about it, hopefully most of my problems get fixed with patches along the early access updates, but im writing about current problems.

Fuck off again

With only two hours for a refund… hard to really know

        Some of us aren’t good sailors 😅
    I knew within the first hour that it was shit.
Not even a month, my friends are already hammering the game like crazy, they'll be done by next week...
This is the real copium lmao
Game Pass version is supremely buggy and so very inconsistent compared to Steam version.
    I learned that shortly after I posted here… I really don’t like paying for early access games.

But this one is getting A TON of attention, so maybe it’ll actually release and have the polish I would hope for.
Craftopia was just updated in December and they have a whole 2024 roadmap lined out
    Yeah, it took them a long time to update because they did a massive change to the game when they made it into a seamless map instead of the island system that was originally there.
    If I just had a birthday in December, that doesn't mean I have birthdays all the time. They cut the pace of development by two thirds once Palworld was announced.
Craftopia didn’t become the most played game on steam history lol
Both of those games still have healthy player numbers. It’s like the top 0.1% of games can maintain hundreds of thousands of players forever. Games not dead when literally thousands of people are playing it everyday
You’re an idiot for the use of “hype game”. wtf is that? Most games lately have a shelf life of a few weeks after initial release. Your comment is dumb as fuck bc it gives zero evidence and makes a click bait comment that likely applies to most games.
    Hype game 
Like battlebit
I feel oit of the loop Here. Everybody's comparing it to ark and I'm like what's ark
    ARK:Survival Evolved. Survival gane where you can fight and tame dinosaurs. And apparently the sequel has vin diesel or something? Idk it’s weird.
    Ark survival evolved. It's a survival game with dinosaurs you can tame, largely has similar aspects like exploring, base building. Crafting, resource management etc
>It’s an early access game that has more content than a lot of fully finished games. Was this post really necessary? Can’t tell if it’s a troll attempt, as the game is literally labeled as unfinished.

Obvious the creators of this game aren't a massive triple A title developer team, so from  a small team standpoint, is it a good idea to develop another game when they already have another game that is also unfinished and still in early access? I could be entirely wrong but to me that doesn't seem to make sense, if they abandon that other game of theirs, who's to say they won't do the same with this game and create a 3rd game years down the road when they've made enough money?

Yeah the game is not finished, doesn't mean it can't have criticism, and my main complaints are the game looks junky and looks like it was made by a AI. Nothing personal, not hating and I haven't tried it so you can't count this as a review, just a question for people who've played it to answer, nothing personal man.
    I only bought Palworld because of what the team has done with Craftopia. Yes Craftopia is still in Early Access, but it receives regular and frequent updates and is a complete game even without being out of EA. Palworld, if they added nothing more to it, would be well worth the $27 I paid for it. Based on their track record, though, we're going to see a huge amount of updates and QoL additions in the coming months. Pocket Pair is a legit good dev team. 

Try it - you'll probably enjoy it.
        > Yes Craftopia is still in Early Access, but it receives regular and frequent updates

Worth noting they cut the pace of development by two thirds after announcing Palworld. Seems a lot of development resources were moved off that project.
    Yeah I doubt it was made by AI. How about trying it out for yourself?
        Like i said, i have no interest in this game and was genuinely asking if this game is actually any good or if it was just a meme, which led to everyone buying it to try it out.
            so try it out if you want to know lmao, opinions are subjective you know, giving criticism like "the game looks janky" when you haven't even touched the game feels a little strange to me. 

it sounds like you already have a preconceived notion of what to feel about the game in your head and all you want is validation tbh
            Good is subjective. Pretty easy to figure out if the game is a meme or not
Dinosaurs grrr
ok mom
>an obviously mediocre and AI-generated game

I finally checked it out yesterday, after all the really unnecessary hype, and those were pretty much my first. It looks like the most generic 2020s game possible. It's like someone asked *Alexa*, not even chat gpt, what are the most popular tropes in the present gaming industry. Pokemon, shooting, survival crafting and building, and that fortnite and genshin children's graphics. I've not checked if it has micro-transactions and some form of battle royale mode, but all signs say it should.

I get that I'm 100% not the target audience, but this looks like the laziest work that ever entered Steam's top played list. Not one original thought went into it. Probably most of the effort went into getting "influencers" to hype.

Sad day for the gaming industry.
    I totally blame consumers for this. Such lack of effort and creativity should never have been rewarded.
/s
Tbh that is a gimmick. They are more like your units than slaves. Ex in all strategy games your units are pretty much yours to command and here similarly. 

Are normal original Pokemon kinda like slavery? If yes then this is also.
Its, early acces, ofc its unfinished duh.
    Okay? Their other game is still "Early Access" after 3.5 years.
        “Games take a long time to make so it’s bad when an early access game also takes a long time to make”
        Star citizen is still in alpha after 10 years of development, still its a game. Buggy mess but still a game.

There is no point complaining just released early acces(alpha or beta) stage game as unfinished.

Thats why its called early acces. Devs try probably finance further development or then its money grab.

Anyway, for me it has been fun experience so far.

If you dont like unfinished games, dont buy earlyacces games.
Do you have the attention span of a gold fish? Lmfao. This is one of the easiest starts to a survival game that I've ever played lmfao
    Being easy to start doesn't mean it's not insufferable or tedious.
        I just don't see it. It's a survival game. Lmfao. It literally let's you automate two of the games most basic resources early. It rewards you for exploring and getting new pals. 

Just sounds like it just isn't your kind of game.
>oh, and the owner is an ai/cryptobro so...

Didn't know that, but this actually makes the most sense of anything that has ever made sense. It should have been rather obvious.
    Tbh i love that im getting downvoted when im right XD
It's sad I had to scroll this far down to see this mentioned. Craftopia was a cheap asset flip with obvious fake patches to create an illusion of it being worked on.

Palworld is a successful scam.
It is 100% Ark with Pokemon.  Anyone who says different is simply not familiar with Ark
    And considering Ark already had poke balls for you dinosaurs it really isn't a big departure. But Ark was honestly pretty bad, Palworld feels like Ark but actually with some intelligent thought behind the design.
        and slavery as well.
            My favorite
            You can basically do that in Ark, it's just instead of making them work you force feed them poop as they waste away in a cage
                that's torture not slavery, sir. Get your human rights violations in order.
        Also, it is designed more with 2 players or single players in mind. Vs ark, which is designed to be played with multiple players.
            Dang.  Was hoping to co-op with my 3 friends.  Is it available to play this way at all?
                You definitely can. It is up to 32 players with a dedicated server, and I think 4 with normal in game hosting.
        Ark, but it respects your time and I don’t have to clear acres of land just to get a decent level 1 base
        Probably the biggest advantage Palworld has over Ark (specifically for your gaming platform) is that Palworld is just under 7 gigabytes in size, compared to over a hundred for Ark (these sizes are from the Xbox versions, they might be different on steam).

The second biggest is that everything is adorable in Palworld.
            I think Ark crosses the 200GB mark on PC with all dlcs. It’s a poorly coded game and absolutely massive.
        yeh ark was always about collecting/taming  "monsters" even without the pokeballs
    It’s just not as hardcore as ark either. I don’t have any gray hairs from playing this haha
    Ark has guns and people are saying it's Pokemon with guns and survival elements... Checks out to me
    To be fair, *waaaaaaaay* more people are going to be familiar with Pokemon than are even going to have ever heard of Ark. That's why
    Ark with Pokémon AND automation. The automation is the biggest part for me
    im glad that most are not familiar with that piece of garbage.
    Yes. This. I played Ark a LONG ass time ago, when it was still in the very beginning Early Access. 


Played Palworld last night, exactly the same but cuter and less clunky (remember my frame of reference was the very beginning of ARK)


I still enjoy it though, far more than Ark. (Plus install size is better, and it's not..built the way..however the fuck the ARK devs write their code lmfao)
Ark already has Pokémon.

They're dinosaurs.
    You're getting downvoted, but you're effectively correct. From the large variety of creatures to having pocket sized dinosaur holding balls.
        Fire Wyvern used flamethrower. Enemy Dodo fainted.
        Those dinosaurs can't farm, mine, log, and build equipment and structures for me while I go catch more though, soooooooo.
            Well, some can, but that's kind of moot because they can't do that in Pokemon either.
    And the 3d models in ark probably weren't stolen from 3d Pokémon games.

Considering what some people have shown.
    Ark has the horrible shitty breeding mini game system of Pokemon dialed up to 100000....

Cause it actually takes hours in real life to hatch an egg just too find out the IVs 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The only pokemon game it’s similar too is Legends Arceus because of the incentive to capture multiples of the same pals but that’s about as far as the gameplay similarities go
    Arceus also has some bare bones gathering and crafting. The bosses in each are very similarly done too.
    Basically what I wanted Legends Arceus to be, except it went a little too far into the survival crafting mechanic. But I'm really enjoying it!
    You mean other than the overtly similar if not identical characters in terms of physiology. Only differences between colors used. lol
I think the same thing, it's more of an Ark style game then Pokemon. Instead of dinosaurs you have the Pal's. You have the entire leveling system that is similar to Ark (unless it changed from when I used to play).  I haven't played Palworld but there is probably more similar things. 

It's Ark with cute monsters that you can make them automate (work) for you.
    Also quite importantly, Palworld feels far more casual friendly and I mean that in the best possible way. It's just far more forgiving and fun to the average player.
        I was tempted to buy it, not for the Pokemon (been a fan since 5 years old) feel but more because it gave me Ark vibes. I wanted to feel that first time playing Ark feeling again. Seeing a dodo for the first time and taming it but it being a Pal in this case.

But back to your point, it does feel and look more casual, that's why I was tempted to play it but then I got turned off with the real time egg hatching mechanics but then found out at a later date you can change these sorts of settings. Letting players change this will bring in a lot more casual play.
            Yeah although those settings could use some work. For example, say you wanted to reduce  egg incubation times, they can be set to half at the 2nd lowest setting or have no incubation time at all iirc.
            So Ive plopped about 8hrs into it, and while i have found a few eggs, I havent even gotten to the incubation part, but thats (so far) not a large part of collecting pals.   I think (I barely played it, and forever ago) Ark puts a massive amount of 'game time' into eggs / breeding that Palworld does not.
yeah that’s just the media being its typical buzz word annoying ass. There’s a couple pals that have abilities with a cooldown that either use guns or the pal turns kinda into a gun but that’s a minor aspect to the game. The best part is hunting for pals that have better work suitability for your base
Really looks like “Chibi ark” to me
>Ark with Pokemon

Which was already a mod!
Its super misleading.  Idk who came up with that shit.
You could be on to something there.
>People going in thinking it is more of a Pokemon game are being misled imo.

It was actually the developer who described it that way.  Which is a huge red flag for me.
I dont think it helps that most of their promotional materials feature pals with guns over base progression and pal slavery. + Pokemon has penetrated the minds of gamers so much its hard to not immediately associate it with Pokemon over Ark. Open world sandbox isn't special, we have Ark, Minecraft, Valheim bit of Stardew Valley, Satisfactory, it's a saturated genre but tiny cute monsters in the wild? Thats pokemon
"Pokemon with guns! You can have slaves!"

That shit needs to go away imo

 
I was entirely gonna skip it due to how cringe this sounds, but some of the recent clips and what not made me get it. I'm super thankful it isn't as crazy cringe as I thought it was going to be. Aside from the goofy catching/eating stuff. It's a great game that has a future
> but the gameplay has nearly nothing in common.

i mean... have you ever seen Pikachu holding a UZI in ash shoulder?

or have a birb shit explosive eggs.
    I've seen a plant shoot exploding eggs on pokemon, does that count?
    Bombirdier is a thing now. But it's a stork dropping stuff from its beak rather than shitting.
Comparing palworld with pokemon because "you have balls and catch monsters" is like comparing palworld with doom. "you have guns and shoot monsters"
    What other games use balls to catch monsters?
        How does it matter? Temten with cards to catch monsters is more like pokemon then palworld with balls. Thats the point.
            well temtem is a clone of pokemon (and a mediocre one at best), this takes an aspect of pokemon, that other games, including ark, took when enough years passed to get away with it.

while also almost certainly taking pokemon assets and morphing and mixing them into new shapes and definitely taking pokemon textures and slapping those onto new models (which in turn are at times also taken from other places, like the totoro one).

they didnt just copy the design philosophy and gave it their own spin.
                \> they didnt just copy the design philosophy and gave it their own spin.

Right, its just an additional game mechanic introduced to valheim philosophy. thats the point. The pokemon (maingames) philosophy has much more then just catching funny monsters with balls. everything besides that is missing.

idk whenever i read people comparing it to a pokemon game it feels like they never played a pokemon game before. Its confusing.
            Because saying the comparison isn’t valid while it’s literally the only game with that exact system makes it a fair comparison to say it’s like Pokémon mixed with arc. It’s not as simple as “doom shoots monsters” when there’s literally thousands of games that shoot monsters but like 1 that captures monsters in balls n shit lol
    but its more like mario land, you can jump !
Yeah. I mean, sure, you have to fight to weaken cute animal-like monst... creatures, and throw a ball at them to catch... sorry, *capture* them. And then you carry them around in your pocket. Then you can rename them, and teach them more abilities. For some, you have to use even more advanced capture balls. And you have to capture very specific types in order to perform very specific tasks, like riding them, or putting out fires.




*Gotta capture all of them!*
    They're probably talking about how main line pokemon games feature turn based combat with a strength and weakness system
        The creatures and moves have types. So far, I've seen normal, dark, grass, and dragon in the first 3 hours.
    Again - lots of surface-level similarities. But the actual moment to moment gameplay is nothing like traditional turn-based Pokémon. 
You catch monsters in balls evel them up and fight them. That's a fairly big similarity. But yeah they've also tacked on the survival aspects. 

Very addictive combo if you ask me.
    Maybe I didn't play long enough, but your comparison is pretty shallow. Yes, you collect monsters and fight them. But it's mostly you doing the fighting while your pet autoattacks randomly. I didn't see any way to command the pet or teach it specific things. It levels up by doing non combat shit like chopping trees at your base.

The core of the combat is in no way similar to the turn based combat from the Pokémon franchise.
        >But it's mostly you doing the fighting while your pet autoattacks randomly.

Except they deal significantly more damage and are better at fighting than you.

Even thugs if you capture them 

>I didn't see any way to command the pet or teach it specific things

What are you talking about 
There are literally skill fruits that work JUST like TMs do

>It levels up by doing non combat shit like chopping trees at your base.

You mean....like PLA did when you were doing things like gathering and stealth catching awarding relatively minor amounts of exp? 

>The core of the combat is in no way similar to the turn based combat from the Pokémon franchise.

Pst, pokemon SV literally has an auto battle function, which while not going through individual attacks like PW, is the same basic thing.
            I'll have to take your word for it. I played the game 30 minutes and uninstalled. 

I like the turn based combat of Pokémon, and I have zero interest in base building, survival, and crafting mechanics. 

It's just not a game for me.
                a moment of silence for the men and women who got scammed by everybody saying "its pokemon with guns" 

RIP your 30$ friend
        It's not "exactly" the same but its pretty damn similar. And yes you can teach moves and command them, but it's not turn based. That's the difference. Iirc some of the more recent Pokémon games have ditched the turned based combat as well...
            Pokémon is turn based, none of the recent games have removed that. At most Legends: Arceus had a slightly modified turn order (not strict 1 turn per Pokémon, it depended on speed), but it was still turn based. 

And the Pals in Palworld aren’t able to be controlled beyond picking skills or using specific active skills (like turning Foxparks into a flamethrower that the player wields). Palworld is definitely more of a normal action combat game than it is Pokémon.
                Well if you are on a mount you get full control over the pal's moves but I get your point. 

Aside from the battling though, collecting the pals, levelling them up, etc it's got a lot in common with Pokémon. I would even argue this is closer to where Pokémon should be these days if game freak weren't so hell bent on holding it back.
                    Moving away from turned-based would be a big FU to the competitive scene.
                        Their recent work has been a big FU to the entire scene over and over again for decades really though hasn't it.

Edit: downvoted eh. We just gonna act like the Pokémon games are good these days? Lol
                            I've enjoyed VGC in this gen significantly more than the last one, probably more than gen 6 as well.
Yeah it kinda reminded me of Fortnite...
The pal pathing is so bad, I started building a second base in a big flat patch just to try and give my pals a place they can actually get around in.  My first base is on a hill and it breaks their brains
Ai in general is pretty bad tbh
> Definetly not rust

I imagine that one big difference is fewer nakeds, lol.
    😂 yes thankfully 
the last good pokemon game was black/white maybe with this gamefreaks can finally shut off auto pilot mode but I doubt it less effort means more money.
Hopefully, this game will be the end of Gamefreak.
    >Hopefully, this game will be the end of Gamefreak.

PW while fun isn't pokemon.


Not will it even scratch the paint of pokemon's success or sales 

Pokemon SV was pretty widely assumed it was going to be trash due to all the problems with PLA and SWSH, it still sold 23.23 million copies
    If you honestly think that, you don’t really understand just how much Pokémon games sell.
humans being caught is not a bug, though.
Replace Valheim with fortnite and zelda and you would be spot on.
I mean it’s still pretty fun, I’m assuming you haven’t touched it because it goes pretty in depth. If people weren’t having fun it wouldn’t be selling this much, considering from what I’ve seen the majority didn’t even know it was coming, they just heard about it after it launched and blew up fast. My little brother saw it and wish-listed it on Steam almost 2 years ago now lol
Compared to when vanilla ark released, Palworld is amazing. But given how much content and development and mods have added to ark, Palworld isn’t close yet.
It is early access.

It literally is an excuse.

It is week 1 of early access.
Yea. There’s almost no way any game can retain this high a player base. Everyone is curious and trying it out because of the hype. Which is great. and if the devs can maintain it and improve it where it needs improvement then it will be a long lasting healthy game.

And yes. It will lose the vast majority of its players and people will point at the big numbers and act like it’s a big deal and some kind of failure.

But in reality a game that gains 50,000 players from the start and maintains 90% of its player base is a success.
A game that gains 1 million from the start and loses 90% of its players is a much bigger success.

BUT it gets painted as a failure because people don’t understand numbers and journalists capitalize on ignorance.
    Unless the devs are working quickly, it's unlikely Palworld will see more than a bugfix in the next few weeks. It doesn't have a very in-depth story. It doesn't have the rush of PvP. Unlike live-service games, the pals don't need to be fed. You can leave forever and come back eventually. And that's what people are going to do. Like No Man's Sky, the devs can boost their sales with future expansions later this year, but in-between, the numbers will dive as the novelty wears off and the annoyances stack up. Nothing new.
        The strange expectations for a non online service game to maintain its population is the crazier thing.
            Yep, the obsession with steam numbers on a non always-online live service game is tiring. Not to mention that Palworld will have a dedicated modding scene since Pokemon modding has been on overdrive since the 2010s. Apparently there's already a Pokemon overhaul mod.
                Holy, you opened eyes, if this game get good a good modding scene it may live forever.


Like, just new Mod pals would already be big


There's a gold mine here
                    New mod pals plus modders can go ham with whatever they want to add since Palworld itself isn't restricted to one genre unlike other games. For all we know there's mods expanding pal combat while there are mods expanding the fps mechanic or mods expanding the automation side while all looking good. That's the great positive of using a modern engine like Unreal Engine 5.

And it's funny that there's already a [Pokemon replacement mod](https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1749381513001767167)  , so if they can do that what's stopping them from adding gym/elite 4 npcs and you get to fight their pokemons in real time at the towers instead of being static like the mainline games.

Ideas so good I can feel the copyright strikes even before it's publicly released. That's how this game lives on even if devs abandon it.
                        Add full modsupport and they will sell 10mill

There would be full pokemon mods within a week
That's exactly how many people play BG3 on average now. Journalists who would choose this POV would be fooling themselves.
Player count is absolutely meaningless. I've played niche online shooters with a player count of around 100 and I had no trouble finding full matches.
    Player count matters when you expect content and updates. Game has to make money to get developed.
    Weird take.
Game loses 1 player (dude actually went to sleep) every youtuber and gaming journalist: PALWOLRD IS DEAD
"this startling trend"
    # Avid film critic watches Goodfellas 10 times, then doesn't watch it for 2 years. Are critics getting burned out of gangster movies?

Comments (133)

* Yeah Goodfellas had some great commentary on second-generation working-class Italians looking to stake their claim in America, but it did feel a little choppy.
   * And as much as I loved the film on release, the blood effects look dated after 30 years.
      * Are you joking dude? When \[major spoiler\] gets shot in the head it was so realistic compared to the CGI crap we have today.
   * The ending felt rushed. Couldn't the script writers have worked longer before they released it?
* I love gangster movies and will buy the steelbook as soon as it goes on sale.
* Unpopular opinion: after 80 years of gangster movies, I'm kind of over them.
   * Agreed. Can we get some more superhero films? I remember back in the day those were so fun to watch. Great times.
      * bro the Dark Knight in theaters was wildddd
      * Ew, gross.
   * no youre good, I feel alot of the same way. Bang BANG rob steal woop de doo...
   * Another "unpopular opinion" that is actually popular.
* Goodfellas made 47 million in the box office which is way less than I thought. Seems like people were burned out of gangster movies back then too.
   * i can see why. it was going up against Ghost which is an objectively better story.
      * The theater went wild for \[major spoiler\]. Like who would choose some boring shoot 'em up over that?
      * "Ghost" was peak. I remember playing that so many times on my dad's VCR. I didn't even understand it!
   * You're crazy. Adjusted for inflation that's almost $111,000,000 today which is *very* good for its time. y'all are just hating.
* Playing this kind of post-WWII drama was important for my childhood.
   * Did you know that Hitler influenced a joke in one scene? \[40 minute YouTube Video\]
   * ya man, what's the dislike? They don't make movies like they used to.

Yadda yadda, same old stuff, it writes itself.
        LOL .... goodfellas is one of the few movies - along with pulp fiction and a few others that I would always watch if I hit on it while channel surfing.

[edikt: numerous spelling fixes]
Yup, this is the sad state of the video game world online. People who like a game just quietly keep playing it but people who dislike it, especially a popular one, want validation for their dislike and seek that out and that’s who articles get written for. It’s so fucking negative and it really makes me feel gross
Honestly the devs could do nothing but add steam workshop support and the game would be thriving in a year
I would but I don’t really care.
    Neither do I but was curious to see who'd call it.
Temtem shot itself by trying to be an MMO without offering enough of a draw to be able to maintain a player base.
    Temtem shot itself by making the game annoying to play so they could sell convenience in the cash shop.
        I mean that's exactly what I said. The grind that can be skipped with microtransactions is the most MMO thing. 

And honestly they could have skipped that. By giving it MMO aspects they basically increased their own running costs as it meant they had to maintain servers for running the game. If they had just kept it as a modest pokemon clone they wouldn't need to try and do battle passes.
            It could have still been massively multiplayer. A Pokémon clone with a persistent overworld and some pvp / co-op elements seemed to be what they were going for. But MMOs don't inherently need to be evil, they just benefit a lot from it.

Personally I think the private server route is better for games like this and Minecraft.
            That is just straight up wrong. Microtransactions don't give you any game advantages or "skip the grind" as you called it. They are purely cosmetic.
Temtem has left a bad taste in my mouth ever since r/theperfectpokemongame would not stop talking about it. I am certain that a significant number of posts about that game were posted by the developers. It does not surprise me at all that it's full of microtransactions. 

The "perfect Pokemon game" at a minimum should have Pokemon in it. If it's not got Pokemon, it's not a Pokemon game.  

That said, Palworld is a great *creature collecting game* and I'm enjoying it more than any of the recent releases from Pokemon! I just wish Gamefreak would release something that is closer to this so that I can enjoy the Pokemon IP again.
> At least Palworld is a $30 game you get for $30, forever.

Awfully confident that they won't add micro-transactions down the road. Wouldn't be the first time.
    Ah true, they could add crap later. I doubt they'd add a cosmetics/convenience store though, because the game has self hosted server infrastructure and custom settings for difficulty (and locally stored saves). You can't sell people cheat codes like EXP boosters when they could just hex-edit a locally saved file or play the game with "exp rate" set to 20x.

Most likely, there'd be paid DLC. Worst case, there's paid cosmetics (which would absolutely be a cash grab and betrayal of the audience).
        Ark added paid dlc expansions before releasing the original game out of early access lol

How did the developers previous game go?


Edit - just checked. Still in early access.
Yeah I'm super surprised Cassette Beasts didn't even get a fraction of the Pokemon community hype Palworld is getting.

It's way closer to pokemon than Palworld while still feeling fresh and unique (plus, the designs are unique and not reused pokemon assets like palworld lol).
It looks to me like if Legends: Arceus was more than a tech demo

In the show Pokémon help build things right? Makes sense you'd have them working in a small town etc
[deleted]
    Basic materials like wood and stone are plentiful yeah, but I feel like crafting ammo or anything else that requires ingots gets very grindy. Doesn't help that it's so heavy that you keep having to run home and drop the ore off so often.
        True. What helps is a second base at an iron spot and let pals do the work of gathering that stuff into a chest next to your palbox. Pick up all, teleport to main Base, unpack into chest next to your palbox there. Done.
            Yup. You unlock the second base just in time to start needing tons of iron. It's pretty clear they intended it to be a mining base.
                And the pals doing work for you, somebody definitely got tired of having to do everything themselves in ark.
                    I haven't played ark but i could understand that from other survival games. The automation is so nice to have.
                        I especially love how organic it is. No need to micromanage. The pals can be specifically instructed, or left to their own devices, and they get shit *done*.
                            Except the fuckin penguin and fox keep leaving their posts. I NEED THAT FRIDGE COLD AND MY INGOTS HOT DAMMIT WHY DID YOU TELEPORT ONTO THE BATTLEMENT
                And you get a third base the moment you start to get the next ingot, so yeah, secondary bases are meant to be gathering.
                Oh thank god I was wondering how I was going to manage ore
                Can your bases get raided while you are not there?  
Will walls help or does the enemy just destroy them?  
what do sand bags actually do?
            It's actually worth smelting it in the same place you farm it and then just move the ingots (as they weigh less and you get more space for crafting in your main base). 4 pals with level 3 mining can get more than 8 deposits before they respawn. So there is plenty of space for 2 carriers and two/three smelters.
                This guy palworlds!
                    Or Factorio'es. Or Satisfactories.
            Yep, and I already have 2 or 3 spots marked on my map as candidates for the second base for iron.
            What I really loved in Pal World that they did, and most times I would need a mod for such features is:

1) Being able to teleport/fast travel while over encumbered (while still being able to move)

2) Crafting stations take resources from chests.

I always assumed I would need the resources on me to craft, like so many other games. Didnt realize until later that it pulled resources from chests within the base boundary. I'm sure other games have done this, but just from the few that i've played it always require resources on your character.

I'm only about 7hrs in, playing solo and absolutely loving the game so far.
            Am I missing something? I built a base right among a bunch of iron and put some depressos down but they’re not touching them. Can’t figure it out.
        There are a fair number of spots with 4+ ore spots around. Once you unlock a second base, build one there and fill it up with Pals with the Mining lvl. 2+ ability, a few pals with transporting and some basic food production. The only chest should be built right next to the pal station.  
The mining pals will continuously mine the ore while the transporters gather it in the chest. Every once in a while you can teleport there, grab the ore and teleport back to your main base. Doesn't matter if you can't move with all the ore, as teleporting is still possible and in your base you can leapfrog the ore by dropping it, moving towards the closest chest and picking it up again.
        The weight is mostly why putting most of your level points into weight is the way to go. Not really a reason to use the points on attack since it increases it by like 2 and your digimons are usually the ones doing the damage
            Or you could just make a grappling hook.

No matter how over encumbered you are you can always use the grappling hook so its easy to move around huge amounts of stuff via your palbox teleport.
            You could use pals with weight increase passive for carrying(starting spots cats have it). I put like 3-4 points into carry weight but I feel like stamina and hp are better investment of points.
        I built my second run base literally in an area with like ten iron deposits in a ring, way up on a mountain too so I can glide to wherever.

Best decision as wood/stone I can generate infinite of, if my fucking foxpark would stop being fucking lazy I'm easily hitting like a thousand ingots in barely any time. Sucks he's bugged out but has the slacker debuff.

I purposefully got two miner skill and two logging skills to give me resources so I usually have a few hundred when I come back + my game bugged out really hard so I have six pals at my base doing everything but they're not actually at my base and don't lose hunger/motivation at all. They're just churning out resources like crazy and taking the occasional break.

Then I have my regular pals that I can actually interact with and they're churning out other stuff.

Plus my mate made a big house but he doesn't know if you crawl up a wall until you hit the ceiling you teleport into the room above you. I've been stealing shit from his locked house to fuck with him for the last two days and then escaping out the roof because he built a big overhang into his second floor.
People played ark without tuning the numbers?
    Ark looked like a second job to me
        That's because ARK IS a second job. 

We had a group of friends all playing together, had a nice base, a bunch of nice dinosaurs, good gear, a nice farm, everything. 

We had all played hard this day, did a lot of work caught a bunch of dinos and everything, what one could call a hard days day of work. So at some point we call it a night and we all crawl into our beds, dead tired from the hard work of the day, well almost all of us. The one player that loved the farming stayed around, she's going around taking care of the farms and grabbing eggs. Thirty minutes-an hour go by and she starts hearing noises outside the base, she goes and checks it out and notices a few players sneaking around our base, she soon finds out that they are raiders, CHINESE RAIDERS! So she being outnumbered and the least PvP confident and least PvP experience player in our group panicks. She jumps on discord voice calling everyone to try to get some help (I think it might have been Skype at the time.), but no help is coming as everyone else is sleeping from their hard day of play/work. So she ends up just hiding there and watching this group of raiders destroy our base and kill our dinos.

6-8-10 hours later as the rest of the group wakes up, they notice the dozens of panicked calls for help, they all quickly jump on the game to witness the aftermath of the devastation with their own eyes and is baaad. There are a few dinos that are somehow still alive, maybe they were set to passive or something and the raiders didn't feel like wasting time killing them, but these are the lower level ones or ones without great stats, used for eggs or manure. Apart from these not good dinos a couple of walls here and there and a few boxes with stone or wood, everything else is gone.

So what is the point of this story? Well I guess you aren't allowed to have any off time from the game and if you do dare to take some time off you better have someone to stay and guard around the clock AND make sure everyone is reachable on their phone at all times so you can come in for emergency wor..I mean play during the weekends.
            That sounds miserable
    Literally that, it looks so awful to play it without atleast x10 loot and honestly i prefer even higher
    there are people that actually play ark on official servers where it has the default config...

Some people are really masochist in playing a survival game where GRIND is really fucking slow.
That's the best part Pokemon sweatshops, they'll do all the work for you!
The good parts.

There's a grind, but its minutes instead of hours.

The pals can actually do a lot of the grinding for you with the right upgrades. Automation back at base grinding up basic resources and crafting stuff like ammo while you go do the fun part.

Big pal eggs take a couple hours to hatch in an incubator, but you aint waiting *days* to only have a baby starve to death because your maewing decided "nah fuck this one".

Its rough, but its a *great* start. Lots of promise.
    What I get from Palworld is that the base, the core, it's already built, there's a solid great stuff here with this direction.


They just need to improve it


 But as a early access, this sold the idea really well 
        From early looks its one of the most complete gameplay experiences that has entered "early access" in recent memory.
Grind can become almost non-existent fairly early on since you can automate practically everything with Pals
    The power of outsourcing labour
I tried out Palworld, it wasn't for me but it did have world setting options where you could jack up the material drop rates to insane degrees so that instead of hitting a tree for 45 seconds it was like, two punches to make a workbench. There are a *lot* of options to customize how much "grind" the game has.

Edit: a friend bought me the game as a gift after I refunded it. It hooked me this time. No regrets
Ark with the bad bits thrown out. 
You get plenty of resources from the trees/rocks and the basic buildings require a totally reasonable amount of wood/stone i.e hit a tree once or twice and you can make a wall instead of needing the entire tree
The grind is nowhere near ark levels. Plus your little pals can do some of the grinding for you passively.
The nice part is that crafting can be automated so not as grindy as ark
And also the 250gb storage usage
The Ark part is very important  
Because this game is nothing like Pokemon  
Whereas Pokemon is a JRPG through and through, Palworld is a crafting focused survival game  
They're not even the same genre of game
Nah, once you work out the controls it explains it fine. Catch Pals, level up, unlock things in your skill tree, repeat.

Pretty fun loop actually, I was shocked by it.
    The fun part is leveling is tied to capturing pals so you only worry about the part of making balls on your Chinese Sweatshop.

so you will still have some use for those pals that you ~~enslave~~ capture.
Ark is extremely grindy. Like "my breeding is done in 6 hours and I need to be on in 6 hours or i wasted 26 hours" type shit. 

Palworld is grindy but more enjoyable in my opinion. Like others said, there's jank but it's a lot more fun. As for the pokemon aspect it's more like acreus than pokemon white. 

Rarely will you be thinking "what do I do now?" You have a clear set of goals through a majority and as soon as you load into the game it's mechanics are clear. Being honest it does a pretty good job of teaching you everything.

And remember you get 2 hours to play, you can just refund if you don't like it. I'm quite a bit of hours in and I find it extremely enjoyable, lots to do , lore , good flair for attacks.
    I'd like to add that Ark is only that grindy if you play on the official settings/servers, which isn't recommended by most players from my experience, unofficial servers and solo play offer a lot more reasonable grind rates.
        I've always avoided Ark because it seems too daunting. Is solo ark reasonable to do and enjoy (with said changed settings)? I've endured solo Valheim and loved it solo.
            Its not bad, but the big problem with Ark is the performance and file size optimization. Last I checked the whole install with DLC is well over 200GB, I had to manually run some windows file compacter tool to bring it down by more than half, and there was no performance impact from that.
            Solo or multi is not the real problem, pve is, last time i played the game it was absolutely not designed or balanced for it, its fine early on, but when it gets bad it does so extremely fast, it also has tons of time wasting, time sensitive mechanics designed to keep you online, its not quite as bad on singleplayer but they are still there.
        Not to mention you can re-tune the values everytime you join the game you created (well, solo anyway). So no worries if you over or undertuned some values (looking at you V Rising).
    Gamespass would be the better trial imo cause then you get the catalog of everything else you can play for the month if not (plus intro price of like $1) yes am aware is behind the steam version but update is planned from what I've heard and I haven't had any issues with it yet
        Highly recommend this approach for people who aren't familiar with this type of game and assume this is just like Pokemon  
I tested it last night on Game Pass and decided the survival nature of it is just not for me
            You can tweak that as well down to like 0 or almost 0 which should help some but yea enough not like Pokemon that don't think it's just Pokemon
I enjoyed Ark by heavily adjusting settings, I don't have time to play on official servers with legit settings. I hosted a server for a few friends, where we cranked the settings in our favour and it was a lot of fun.

I've wanted to try single player, but it doesn't seem as interesting for me anyways.

I think Ark is okay to go in blind, but you'll definitely be Googling some wikis as you go along.
Grind > Die > Grind > Die
No he meant the opposite, the people who think the game is only popular now because of the hype and will die in early access once the hype is gone
    Ah I see I see, I actually purchased it after I made that comment and just played for about 5 hours straight with a friend, was not expecting to enjoy it that much
You can also one shot bosses with it if you time it right
    What is it, throwing one when they are too high hp to be caught?
There’s guns and violence, but no blood/gore. There are some things like the pals crying when you’re fighting them, or if you treat them poorly in your base that a child may find disturbing. There’s also paldeck/Pokédex descriptions that describe certain pals being used for execution.
    Well, there's also the Butcher's Knife item that lets you butcher Pals that you've caught. My 9-year-old can't decide if he finds that disturbing or hilarious, but that's kind of the human condition, I guess. Nothing else in the game is nearly that disturbing, but it's a great platform for talking to your kids about how we treat animals in the real world, for better or worse.

edit: You can also capture "bad guys" and use them for your bidding, which is a little weird and might also be a bit unsettling depending. I feel like 7 is old enough to understand most of what's going on, but you might need to talk them through some things occasionally.
        > My 9-year-old can't decide if he finds that disturbing or hilarious

I'm 31 and same
        Just a heads-up, though you're unlikely to try yourself, uless you're really curious. You can butcher anything in a pal sphere, and anything in A pal sphere is considered a pal.


 Ergo you can use the butcher knife in humans, so avoid that lol
            I wondered. Thank you for filling in that gap in my knowledge. xD
    Honestly, it's about as violent as Fortnite. If you think that's not appropriate for your kids, then this isn't either.
        It's weird. Having kids has made me way less judgmental toward other parents about almost everything, but as a game enjoyer, I am incredibly vigilant about my son's games and am surprised at what other parents allow.

It's not like my parents who didn't really understand games and ended up not doing much about it (basically the era that birthed the ESRB). 

Rather, I know exactly how addictive games can be and how much time (and ambition) they can suck up. I want him to enjoy games that enable his creativity and abilities, rather than stifling them. 

And that's not even addressing the content discussion. I saw what happened when our nephew was allowed to play games like Call of Duty at 5 or 6. The poor kid is a desensitized drone, and I think it's in no small part due to his mom allowing completely unmonitored/unrestricted gaming time. 

To be clear, I think this aspect is a symptom of their greater (lack of) parenting issues, but he's also never been given the privilege of getting to know who he is without a game to sink hours into.

Sorry. I don't know what about your comment sparked my gaming dad soapbox moment, but I hope somebody got something out of it.
    Also y'know, the human slavery. And the 69th entry in the paldex (edit:  legitimately they made a pal whose thing is "it has breasts and wants to make love with everything" and made it number 69)
        Important to note that this specific Pal was actually going to be a different number at first, 49 I've heard. They changed it because of a suggestion for it to be 69 on their discord, which makes them good devs who have spent time listening to fans somewhat.
            >  which makes them good devs who have spent time listening to fans somewhat.

I can't work out if this is sarcastic as hearing this aspect just made me groan in annoyance even harder that the devs chose to cater to people who need to touch grass.
The writing tries kinda hard to have an edge to it, but I don't think its so bad you wouldn't let her play it. The only real problem is that edginess extends to the pal descriptions in the Paldeck where they describe the Pals ripping the skin off in public executions or non-consensually mating with humans.
    One of the first Pals has a description that says it's got the mental capacity of a human 5 to 7 year old, which is great up until they started figuring out how to use weapons and killed their trainers.
My Pal called Depresso was hungry and the in game text said "*the lazy bastard is sleepy*". 

Gameplay is fine for kids but there is stuff like the above text in it.

In Europe its pending PEGI 12 (12 and above ages). In the US I would say it will be 16 and above as US ratings tend to be more strict when it comes to bad language vs Europe where ages 12 and up are fine for bad language and its only 16 and up if the language is sexual or very in your face / over the top.
Depends, are you in America? 7 yo is good to go on wholesome gun blasting goodness!

Before the NRA sicks their bots on me, seriously just taking the piss lol.
When I hear the word AI, I imagine something uninspired lacking cohesion (lacking soul), not what you said. But might be the case of different people, different meanings.
    Problem is AI should not be associated with that. All games with NPCs use some sort of AI but not generative AI.
I think we have already other existing games ripping of Pokemon, Pokemon ripped of also other ips and tbh they went lazy with many new designs. What I'm trying to say is it is not enough to put Palworld guys in court most likely.
It's also in early access, which many people seem to be forgetting who've shamed this game for having bugs. It has less bugs than some full release games, including Pokémon Scarlet/Violet.
    Man I remember playing Scarlet on release and didn’t have a single bug, not even the memory leak. The game was just hella unoptimized tho. So far palworld is the first paid Early Access game that has felt good to me, but I’ve also just played a lot of shitty early access titles lmao
fair enough,  yea I got hit through the bottom of the world once and my pals have gotten stuck at the base but usually sort themselves out. Plus one of the pal skills caused my character to sink into the world. But overall I would say it really aint that janky.
I was wondering the same thing. I have noticed in the past on here that a lot of people crusade for different franchises or really anything they are interested in despite the reality of things. So I thought this may be a similar situation. I grew up with Pokemon and somewhat like the survival genre so I am happy to have something like this come out and do it pretty damn well.
    I can't agree more, and I'm not even really interested in the game! It just makes me happy to see more options and interesting ideas out there.
i dont even like pokemon and i have many issues with this game.  there are game breaking bugs and its annoying.  but hopefully with some time they are fixed.  good game
>This is what happens when you make inanimate objects and concepts like corporate franchises your entire personality.


The irony of getting of super defensive about a game and then ending it with this lmao.
    Doing something you said you don’t like (and they weren’t even lmao) is definitely irony, you’re very good at using that word and you should keep doing it
You really are telling yourself the only people that might criticize the game are Pokemon fans losing their minds out of jealousy, then say they’re the ones too attached to a game?
One of the better survival games does not mean the best. I would say my favorite survival game was Subnautica so far. But I think this has some better aspects than other survival games I have played. Better Graphics than ark S E, Better controller support than most of them, Better combat than say minecraft or no mans sky, more quality of life features than a lot of them. Im sure I can think of more but I think those demonstrate well enough as to why I said it is one of the better ones I have played. Not to say I did not like any of the games I am comparing this game to.
    Even one of the best is far fetched imo. The game does everything good. But is not great at anything.

Graphics are all right but they are not crazy either. Again, well executed but not great per se.

Combat is average, Valheim for example is way more engaging. Again the game execute well but isn't really great at combat.
        “One of the better…”, not *best*, and they said it twice. Just fucking read bro. There’s whole ass South Park episode about people like you.
            Lol. Chill out

You can say whatever you want and bitch on semantic (because it's all you have). The game is average at best for a game of that kind.

It does nothing bad but it does nothing great either.

There's dozens of games that do better in different aspect of it. It is just average at everything.
I'm of the same mindset. No interest until full release.

That said, Baldurs Gate 3 was in early access for 3 years so I wouldn't judge a game purely by how long it's been in early access.
    Yes, but BG3 eventually released.  This developer now has three games in Early Access, but neither of the first two are even close to a full release.
    Larian had a history of delivering and finishing early access games, this studio has the opposite.
because they don’t need to invest a lot into their games. They use the same formula with copy and pasted elements. Boom 10mill+ copies sold. It’s worked for 24+ years, and will continue to work.
    I don't think that's fair. Their early work (especially the first 3 gens) is clearly a labour of love. They put a lot of effort into those games and for the time they were incredible. And gen 3 still holds up in my opinion. 

They've been doing the same formula for a long time now, but it didn't start out that way.
I wouldn't say it looks all that great. The pals don't fit in with the world style, they and the characters clash with it hard.

I hope somewhere along the way they make the world textures fit the Pals because it really sticks out.

Pokémon Violet doesn't look amazing either (so much pop in and low rez textures) but at least it's consistent.
Hopefully that team can make good use of their new funds to expand this into something quite special.

    Let's see, [4 million copies](https://www.pcgamer.com/that-pokemon-with-guns-game-palworld-just-sold-4-million-copies-in-3-days-and-it-isnt-slowing-down/) @ 26.99 dollars = 107.96 million dollars.

They've earned over 100 million dollars in just 4 days, they might be able to:

1. afford better offices/equipment
2. hire more developers
3. build a Scrooge McDuck money vault.
not that it really matters, but the dev team during development was composed of 50+ people. still a feat tho
Its funny because pal is in early-early access and it's less jank than Ark. The pals can at least pathfind decently
    It also runs so much better than ark. Ark has lag spikes every minute even on solo, palword has stable 60fps constantly
Early develoment Ark was also horribly laggy, this game is very smooth in comparison.
me too i hate ARK with my soul
My experience with Ark a few years ago was spending multiple hours drugging a small dinosaur, then on my way back to my crappy base watching it get permanently killed by a giant alligator. In the same amount of Palworld I captured like 50 off-brand Pokemon and built two bases, it's more of a fun casual experience.
It is in fact the best comparison. Just because you do not like Ark does not mean this game isn't similar to Ark.
    True that.

But in terms of gameplay mechanics, isn't both Palworld and Ark similar to other games in the same genre? 

Base building from template structures, resource gathering (berries, stone, wood, smelting ore into ingots, etc.), weapon smithing, boss battling, world exploration, cave spelunking, different biomes, etc.

All these things are also things you can do/find in Valheim for instance.
        The systems for palworld are directly copy-pasted from Ark, they’re not just similar. The level progression is almost identical (level up, get points  to invest in escalating levels of tech, as well as picking small incremental stat upgrades). The monsters all serve a very specific function. The needing to craft specific saddles and harnesses to utilizes the monsters for their economic purpose.

Palworld takes most of its DNA from Ark, but it also has cherry-picked some things that worked in other recent innovative games. I see inspiration from BOTW/genshin, Elden ring, valheim, legends arceus, but this almost feels like an Ark mod with massive QOL inprovements.
Same genre of game. Valheim doesn't have taming, i think though? Which is why I would compare it to Ark.
    Ahh right okay. I haven’t played Ark. Valheim does have farming, but it’s not the focus of the game
Got em!
"come. Let me show you my pal"
    Now, let me show you my favorite pal.
You can swap around your Pal's abilities in the party menu and you can teach them new ones with skill fruits.
    You mean Devil Fruits. :D
That's what lacks for me. More stuff and in depth things to do with those Pals. Let me chose between controlling them in combat or let AI do it's thing.

There's a lot of potential to explore on that part, because that's really the aspect that set him appart from other games.

The building system is too simple for me to really invite me spending time in it. 

And there's no real incitive to go out and get other Pals or better pals.
The combat of botw might be a little bit deeper than palworld but having played hundreds of hours of it, it's not that deep. Most of the complexity was wholly unnecessary to regular gameplay, even on the hardmode.

Botw is a much, MUCH better exploration game and even a better speedrun game than it is a combat game. Totk isn't much better, the only way it truly expanded on combat is through the contraptions and additional map bosses.

Palworld has all of the exploration value botw had, and it's captivated my interest better than totk did, largely just because it's not the same damn map I played the first time. I daresay it does a better job, because shrines were dumb and koroks were a painful waste of your time. Palworld has more enemies to fight, more interesting collectables and points of interest to find, and you unlock advanced movement options quicker than you do in botw.

I think the main thing botw did better was bossfights and towns, and there's only 6 and 7 of those.

"Oh hey look, another bokoblin camp! Yay!"
>the combat of BotW is much deeper than this

...eh. I can't say I'd agree. BoTW combat in particular is painfully simplistic, even when compared to the Zelda games that came before it nevermind when comparing it to most other modern games.
    Simple and deep can coexist. Its very easy to walk up to an enemy and just swing your sword until they die. But then you learn about perfect dodges and bullet time, which gives some nice depth while staying simple. Then you have the runes, which bombs alone are crazy, as well as shield partying, sneak strikes, head shots, etc that give you so many options to use. Not to mention weapons breaking and dealing critical damage and timing that to throw them for a final burst of damage.

The combat is simple, yes, but the further you delve the deeper it gets. Just look up the crazy combat clips and you'll get what I'm saying. Palworld doesn't have that depth.
        That's a fair assessment in comparison to Pal World, least, though I can't say I really find it any more interesting or engaging than most other modern AAA games.
Lots of games go into early access. It’s a bit of a trap now, but it’s often done to secure funding and ensure more development. 

Lots of successful games were built in and stayed in EA up until a release years later. And likewise lots have been abandoned after their game didn’t sell. 

Look to see if they are communicating and updating. Or if not updating at least communicating about updating. 

For my own game we are not going to do EA, but instead continue to update after our intended release. But also have monthly communication about our plans and milestones.
A dash? The music queue and the UI when you enter a new area is just BOTW designs
I don’t know about that one chief 😂
    As someone who doesn't get it, it objectively is. Achieving 3 million sales in 48 hours and having an active player base of over 1 million on steam is groundbreaking for what was a relatively unknown developer. Even if those numbers crash and burn in say a week.
        Thing is, this game isn’t something people will remember in like 5-10 years. No one in 10 years will be like remember Palword? Good times. No, because it’s a flavor of the month game that doesn’t have longevity. Compare it to something like Minecraft that people talk about to this day. It’s a sudden spike in popularity but I predict it will crash and burn very fast and be forgotten soon.
            Even if that's true, it's still worth to play and enjoy something even for a short period of time. The game is genuine fun and unique imo. Will I be playing it in a month or two? Don't know, but I've already gotten my money's worth (GamePass) and enjoyed my time.
            They will remember it because it’s in the history books now, you can’t look up top purchased game on steam without seeing Palworld
    He’s objectively correct?
    I’m not just making that up… go look

- Crashes/bugs

- limited keybinds (french keyboard have that weird thing where "4" and the "$" symbol are inverted, so I have to type "MAJ+$" to get "4", but it doesn't work in game, I just can't repair buildings)

- Stats balance

- tech points acquisition solo vs multiplayer balance. (basically the whole progression system is janky)

- Pal balance

- NPC's are barebone.

- The texts aren't all there yet (lots of "en text" as descriptions)

- generic UI

- No "exit the game" button, I have to either switch to window mode or kill it with the task manager.
    >Crashes/bugs

Yes

>limited keybinds (french keyboard have that weird thing where "4" and the "$" symbol are inverted, so I have to type "MAJ+$" to get "4", but it doesn't work in game, I just can't repair buildings)

Don't see how that's the game's problem, how about using a normal keyboard.

> Stats balance

You're the one that puts the stat points on the character, so that does sound like skill issue.

> tech points acquisition solo vs multiplayer balance. (basically the whole progression system is janky)

There's not a difference between solo and multiplayer unless the host decides to change it.

> Pal balance

Don't know what you mean with this.

>- NPC's are barebone.

Somewhat yes.

>The texts aren't all there yet (lots of "en text" as descriptions)

Didn't have this problem with the spanish translation so far.

> generic UI

I've seen worse but yes.

>No "exit the game" button, I have to either switch to window mode or kill it with the task manager.

Straight up false. You only need to press ESC and the last option in the menu allows you to exit your save and then exit the game.
lmao, sure...
That just takes more time than save quitting
Catching pals is boring because i double tap their face with a shotgun, and they get to 3% hp and i still have 20% catch chance with the ultra sphere and 2x boost from world settings against level 40 pals while being 40 myself. After that im just spamming Spheres for like 5 times, and after using up my 30 spheres i have to grind 20mins for the next 30 again.

I havent played Ark before so i dont know about its taming mechanics, but atleast with pokemon i can get new and better balls pretty much more easily, and the catch rate feels better in that.

To be fair i had a similar problem in legends arceus where i sometimes had to spam a mon with balls.

Also how do you get exp? like 90% of my exp comes from first 10 catches of a specific pal variety so its a pretty fucking big focus on the gameplay loop lmao.

I think ive given the game a fair shot, being at 26 hours now, and using most of my vacation day playing it on a monday.

fuck off
    [deleted]
        Are you actually trolling? Am i just being wooshed really badly? Also you just totally didnt read my response because i already said that i have maxed out the capture rate and it still feels bad. Its about as engaging as actual pokemon catching because you just stand there waiting for the sphere to fail and throw again multiple times in a row in higher levels.

You just sound like a fanboy at this moment because we cant criticize your beloved pokemon killer or some shit like that.

I played the game and said what i feel about it, hopefully most of my problems get fixed with patches along the early access updates, but im writing about current problems.

Fuck off again
            [deleted]
                I really fell for it man lmao gj :D

                        Cmon man you can stop already :P the jig is up :D
go to the high seas test it there then buy it.
    Some of us aren’t good sailors 😅
I knew within the first hour that it was shit.
I learned that shortly after I posted here… I really don’t like paying for early access games.

But this one is getting A TON of attention, so maybe it’ll actually release and have the polish I would hope for.
Yeah, it took them a long time to update because they did a massive change to the game when they made it into a seamless map instead of the island system that was originally there.
If I just had a birthday in December, that doesn't mean I have birthdays all the time. They cut the pace of development by two thirds once Palworld was announced.
Hype game 
Like battlebit
ARK:Survival Evolved. Survival gane where you can fight and tame dinosaurs. And apparently the sequel has vin diesel or something? Idk it’s weird.
Ark survival evolved. It's a survival game with dinosaurs you can tame, largely has similar aspects like exploring, base building. Crafting, resource management etc
I only bought Palworld because of what the team has done with Craftopia. Yes Craftopia is still in Early Access, but it receives regular and frequent updates and is a complete game even without being out of EA. Palworld, if they added nothing more to it, would be well worth the $27 I paid for it. Based on their track record, though, we're going to see a huge amount of updates and QoL additions in the coming months. Pocket Pair is a legit good dev team. 

Try it - you'll probably enjoy it.
    > Yes Craftopia is still in Early Access, but it receives regular and frequent updates

Worth noting they cut the pace of development by two thirds after announcing Palworld. Seems a lot of development resources were moved off that project.
Yeah I doubt it was made by AI. How about trying it out for yourself?
    Like i said, i have no interest in this game and was genuinely asking if this game is actually any good or if it was just a meme, which led to everyone buying it to try it out.
        so try it out if you want to know lmao, opinions are subjective you know, giving criticism like "the game looks janky" when you haven't even touched the game feels a little strange to me. 

it sounds like you already have a preconceived notion of what to feel about the game in your head and all you want is validation tbh
        Good is subjective. Pretty easy to figure out if the game is a meme or not
I totally blame consumers for this. Such lack of effort and creativity should never have been rewarded.
Okay? Their other game is still "Early Access" after 3.5 years.
    “Games take a long time to make so it’s bad when an early access game also takes a long time to make”
    Star citizen is still in alpha after 10 years of development, still its a game. Buggy mess but still a game.

There is no point complaining just released early acces(alpha or beta) stage game as unfinished.

Thats why its called early acces. Devs try probably finance further development or then its money grab.

Anyway, for me it has been fun experience so far.

If you dont like unfinished games, dont buy earlyacces games.
Being easy to start doesn't mean it's not insufferable or tedious.
    I just don't see it. It's a survival game. Lmfao. It literally let's you automate two of the games most basic resources early. It rewards you for exploring and getting new pals. 

Just sounds like it just isn't your kind of game.
Tbh i love that im getting downvoted when im right XD
And considering Ark already had poke balls for you dinosaurs it really isn't a big departure. But Ark was honestly pretty bad, Palworld feels like Ark but actually with some intelligent thought behind the design.
    and slavery as well.
        My favorite
        You can basically do that in Ark, it's just instead of making them work you force feed them poop as they waste away in a cage
            that's torture not slavery, sir. Get your human rights violations in order.
    Also, it is designed more with 2 players or single players in mind. Vs ark, which is designed to be played with multiple players.
        Dang.  Was hoping to co-op with my 3 friends.  Is it available to play this way at all?
            You definitely can. It is up to 32 players with a dedicated server, and I think 4 with normal in game hosting.
    Ark, but it respects your time and I don’t have to clear acres of land just to get a decent level 1 base
    Probably the biggest advantage Palworld has over Ark (specifically for your gaming platform) is that Palworld is just under 7 gigabytes in size, compared to over a hundred for Ark (these sizes are from the Xbox versions, they might be different on steam).

The second biggest is that everything is adorable in Palworld.
        I think Ark crosses the 200GB mark on PC with all dlcs. It’s a poorly coded game and absolutely massive.
    yeh ark was always about collecting/taming  "monsters" even without the pokeballs
It’s just not as hardcore as ark either. I don’t have any gray hairs from playing this haha
Ark has guns and people are saying it's Pokemon with guns and survival elements... Checks out to me
To be fair, *waaaaaaaay* more people are going to be familiar with Pokemon than are even going to have ever heard of Ark. That's why
Ark with Pokémon AND automation. The automation is the biggest part for me
im glad that most are not familiar with that piece of garbage.
Yes. This. I played Ark a LONG ass time ago, when it was still in the very beginning Early Access. 


Played Palworld last night, exactly the same but cuter and less clunky (remember my frame of reference was the very beginning of ARK)


I still enjoy it though, far more than Ark. (Plus install size is better, and it's not..built the way..however the fuck the ARK devs write their code lmfao)
You're getting downvoted, but you're effectively correct. From the large variety of creatures to having pocket sized dinosaur holding balls.
    Fire Wyvern used flamethrower. Enemy Dodo fainted.
    Those dinosaurs can't farm, mine, log, and build equipment and structures for me while I go catch more though, soooooooo.
        Well, some can, but that's kind of moot because they can't do that in Pokemon either.
And the 3d models in ark probably weren't stolen from 3d Pokémon games.

Considering what some people have shown.
Ark has the horrible shitty breeding mini game system of Pokemon dialed up to 100000....

Cause it actually takes hours in real life to hatch an egg just too find out the IVs 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arceus also has some bare bones gathering and crafting. The bosses in each are very similarly done too.
Basically what I wanted Legends Arceus to be, except it went a little too far into the survival crafting mechanic. But I'm really enjoying it!
You mean other than the overtly similar if not identical characters in terms of physiology. Only differences between colors used. lol
Also quite importantly, Palworld feels far more casual friendly and I mean that in the best possible way. It's just far more forgiving and fun to the average player.
    I was tempted to buy it, not for the Pokemon (been a fan since 5 years old) feel but more because it gave me Ark vibes. I wanted to feel that first time playing Ark feeling again. Seeing a dodo for the first time and taming it but it being a Pal in this case.

But back to your point, it does feel and look more casual, that's why I was tempted to play it but then I got turned off with the real time egg hatching mechanics but then found out at a later date you can change these sorts of settings. Letting players change this will bring in a lot more casual play.
        Yeah although those settings could use some work. For example, say you wanted to reduce  egg incubation times, they can be set to half at the 2nd lowest setting or have no incubation time at all iirc.
        So Ive plopped about 8hrs into it, and while i have found a few eggs, I havent even gotten to the incubation part, but thats (so far) not a large part of collecting pals.   I think (I barely played it, and forever ago) Ark puts a massive amount of 'game time' into eggs / breeding that Palworld does not.
I've seen a plant shoot exploding eggs on pokemon, does that count?
Bombirdier is a thing now. But it's a stork dropping stuff from its beak rather than shitting.
What other games use balls to catch monsters?
    How does it matter? Temten with cards to catch monsters is more like pokemon then palworld with balls. Thats the point.
        well temtem is a clone of pokemon (and a mediocre one at best), this takes an aspect of pokemon, that other games, including ark, took when enough years passed to get away with it.

while also almost certainly taking pokemon assets and morphing and mixing them into new shapes and definitely taking pokemon textures and slapping those onto new models (which in turn are at times also taken from other places, like the totoro one).

they didnt just copy the design philosophy and gave it their own spin.
            \> they didnt just copy the design philosophy and gave it their own spin.

Right, its just an additional game mechanic introduced to valheim philosophy. thats the point. The pokemon (maingames) philosophy has much more then just catching funny monsters with balls. everything besides that is missing.

idk whenever i read people comparing it to a pokemon game it feels like they never played a pokemon game before. Its confusing.
        Because saying the comparison isn’t valid while it’s literally the only game with that exact system makes it a fair comparison to say it’s like Pokémon mixed with arc. It’s not as simple as “doom shoots monsters” when there’s literally thousands of games that shoot monsters but like 1 that captures monsters in balls n shit lol
but its more like mario land, you can jump !
They're probably talking about how main line pokemon games feature turn based combat with a strength and weakness system
    The creatures and moves have types. So far, I've seen normal, dark, grass, and dragon in the first 3 hours.
Again - lots of surface-level similarities. But the actual moment to moment gameplay is nothing like traditional turn-based Pokémon. 
Maybe I didn't play long enough, but your comparison is pretty shallow. Yes, you collect monsters and fight them. But it's mostly you doing the fighting while your pet autoattacks randomly. I didn't see any way to command the pet or teach it specific things. It levels up by doing non combat shit like chopping trees at your base.

The core of the combat is in no way similar to the turn based combat from the Pokémon franchise.
    >But it's mostly you doing the fighting while your pet autoattacks randomly.

Except they deal significantly more damage and are better at fighting than you.

Even thugs if you capture them 

>I didn't see any way to command the pet or teach it specific things

What are you talking about 
There are literally skill fruits that work JUST like TMs do

>It levels up by doing non combat shit like chopping trees at your base.

You mean....like PLA did when you were doing things like gathering and stealth catching awarding relatively minor amounts of exp? 

>The core of the combat is in no way similar to the turn based combat from the Pokémon franchise.

Pst, pokemon SV literally has an auto battle function, which while not going through individual attacks like PW, is the same basic thing.
        I'll have to take your word for it. I played the game 30 minutes and uninstalled. 

I like the turn based combat of Pokémon, and I have zero interest in base building, survival, and crafting mechanics. 

It's just not a game for me.
            a moment of silence for the men and women who got scammed by everybody saying "its pokemon with guns" 

RIP your 30$ friend
    It's not "exactly" the same but its pretty damn similar. And yes you can teach moves and command them, but it's not turn based. That's the difference. Iirc some of the more recent Pokémon games have ditched the turned based combat as well...
        Pokémon is turn based, none of the recent games have removed that. At most Legends: Arceus had a slightly modified turn order (not strict 1 turn per Pokémon, it depended on speed), but it was still turn based. 

And the Pals in Palworld aren’t able to be controlled beyond picking skills or using specific active skills (like turning Foxparks into a flamethrower that the player wields). Palworld is definitely more of a normal action combat game than it is Pokémon.
            Well if you are on a mount you get full control over the pal's moves but I get your point. 

Aside from the battling though, collecting the pals, levelling them up, etc it's got a lot in common with Pokémon. I would even argue this is closer to where Pokémon should be these days if game freak weren't so hell bent on holding it back.
                Moving away from turned-based would be a big FU to the competitive scene.
                    Their recent work has been a big FU to the entire scene over and over again for decades really though hasn't it.

Edit: downvoted eh. We just gonna act like the Pokémon games are good these days? Lol
                        I've enjoyed VGC in this gen significantly more than the last one, probably more than gen 6 as well.
😂 yes thankfully 
>Hopefully, this game will be the end of Gamefreak.

PW while fun isn't pokemon.


Not will it even scratch the paint of pokemon's success or sales 

Pokemon SV was pretty widely assumed it was going to be trash due to all the problems with PLA and SWSH, it still sold 23.23 million copies
If you honestly think that, you don’t really understand just how much Pokémon games sell.
Unless the devs are working quickly, it's unlikely Palworld will see more than a bugfix in the next few weeks. It doesn't have a very in-depth story. It doesn't have the rush of PvP. Unlike live-service games, the pals don't need to be fed. You can leave forever and come back eventually. And that's what people are going to do. Like No Man's Sky, the devs can boost their sales with future expansions later this year, but in-between, the numbers will dive as the novelty wears off and the annoyances stack up. Nothing new.
    The strange expectations for a non online service game to maintain its population is the crazier thing.
        Yep, the obsession with steam numbers on a non always-online live service game is tiring. Not to mention that Palworld will have a dedicated modding scene since Pokemon modding has been on overdrive since the 2010s. Apparently there's already a Pokemon overhaul mod.
            Holy, you opened eyes, if this game get good a good modding scene it may live forever.


Like, just new Mod pals would already be big


There's a gold mine here
                New mod pals plus modders can go ham with whatever they want to add since Palworld itself isn't restricted to one genre unlike other games. For all we know there's mods expanding pal combat while there are mods expanding the fps mechanic or mods expanding the automation side while all looking good. That's the great positive of using a modern engine like Unreal Engine 5.

And it's funny that there's already a [Pokemon replacement mod](https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1749381513001767167)  , so if they can do that what's stopping them from adding gym/elite 4 npcs and you get to fight their pokemons in real time at the towers instead of being static like the mainline games.

Ideas so good I can feel the copyright strikes even before it's publicly released. That's how this game lives on even if devs abandon it.
                    Add full modsupport and they will sell 10mill

There would be full pokemon mods within a week
Player count matters when you expect content and updates. Game has to make money to get developed.
Weird take.
# Avid film critic watches Goodfellas 10 times, then doesn't watch it for 2 years. Are critics getting burned out of gangster movies?

Comments (133)

* Yeah Goodfellas had some great commentary on second-generation working-class Italians looking to stake their claim in America, but it did feel a little choppy.
   * And as much as I loved the film on release, the blood effects look dated after 30 years.
      * Are you joking dude? When \[major spoiler\] gets shot in the head it was so realistic compared to the CGI crap we have today.
   * The ending felt rushed. Couldn't the script writers have worked longer before they released it?
* I love gangster movies and will buy the steelbook as soon as it goes on sale.
* Unpopular opinion: after 80 years of gangster movies, I'm kind of over them.
   * Agreed. Can we get some more superhero films? I remember back in the day those were so fun to watch. Great times.
      * bro the Dark Knight in theaters was wildddd
      * Ew, gross.
   * no youre good, I feel alot of the same way. Bang BANG rob steal woop de doo...
   * Another "unpopular opinion" that is actually popular.
* Goodfellas made 47 million in the box office which is way less than I thought. Seems like people were burned out of gangster movies back then too.
   * i can see why. it was going up against Ghost which is an objectively better story.
      * The theater went wild for \[major spoiler\]. Like who would choose some boring shoot 'em up over that?
      * "Ghost" was peak. I remember playing that so many times on my dad's VCR. I didn't even understand it!
   * You're crazy. Adjusted for inflation that's almost $111,000,000 today which is *very* good for its time. y'all are just hating.
* Playing this kind of post-WWII drama was important for my childhood.
   * Did you know that Hitler influenced a joke in one scene? \[40 minute YouTube Video\]
   * ya man, what's the dislike? They don't make movies like they used to.

Yadda yadda, same old stuff, it writes itself.
    LOL .... goodfellas is one of the few movies - along with pulp fiction and a few others that I would always watch if I hit on it while channel surfing.

[edikt: numerous spelling fixes]
Neither do I but was curious to see who'd call it.
Temtem shot itself by making the game annoying to play so they could sell convenience in the cash shop.
    I mean that's exactly what I said. The grind that can be skipped with microtransactions is the most MMO thing. 

And honestly they could have skipped that. By giving it MMO aspects they basically increased their own running costs as it meant they had to maintain servers for running the game. If they had just kept it as a modest pokemon clone they wouldn't need to try and do battle passes.
        It could have still been massively multiplayer. A Pokémon clone with a persistent overworld and some pvp / co-op elements seemed to be what they were going for. But MMOs don't inherently need to be evil, they just benefit a lot from it.

Personally I think the private server route is better for games like this and Minecraft.
        That is just straight up wrong. Microtransactions don't give you any game advantages or "skip the grind" as you called it. They are purely cosmetic.
Ah true, they could add crap later. I doubt they'd add a cosmetics/convenience store though, because the game has self hosted server infrastructure and custom settings for difficulty (and locally stored saves). You can't sell people cheat codes like EXP boosters when they could just hex-edit a locally saved file or play the game with "exp rate" set to 20x.

Most likely, there'd be paid DLC. Worst case, there's paid cosmetics (which would absolutely be a cash grab and betrayal of the audience).
    Ark added paid dlc expansions before releasing the original game out of early access lol

How did the developers previous game go?


Edit - just checked. Still in early access.
Basic materials like wood and stone are plentiful yeah, but I feel like crafting ammo or anything else that requires ingots gets very grindy. Doesn't help that it's so heavy that you keep having to run home and drop the ore off so often.
    True. What helps is a second base at an iron spot and let pals do the work of gathering that stuff into a chest next to your palbox. Pick up all, teleport to main Base, unpack into chest next to your palbox there. Done.
        Yup. You unlock the second base just in time to start needing tons of iron. It's pretty clear they intended it to be a mining base.
            And the pals doing work for you, somebody definitely got tired of having to do everything themselves in ark.
                I haven't played ark but i could understand that from other survival games. The automation is so nice to have.
                    I especially love how organic it is. No need to micromanage. The pals can be specifically instructed, or left to their own devices, and they get shit *done*.
                        Except the fuckin penguin and fox keep leaving their posts. I NEED THAT FRIDGE COLD AND MY INGOTS HOT DAMMIT WHY DID YOU TELEPORT ONTO THE BATTLEMENT
            And you get a third base the moment you start to get the next ingot, so yeah, secondary bases are meant to be gathering.
            Oh thank god I was wondering how I was going to manage ore
            Can your bases get raided while you are not there?  
Will walls help or does the enemy just destroy them?  
what do sand bags actually do?
        It's actually worth smelting it in the same place you farm it and then just move the ingots (as they weigh less and you get more space for crafting in your main base). 4 pals with level 3 mining can get more than 8 deposits before they respawn. So there is plenty of space for 2 carriers and two/three smelters.
            This guy palworlds!
                Or Factorio'es. Or Satisfactories.
        Yep, and I already have 2 or 3 spots marked on my map as candidates for the second base for iron.
        What I really loved in Pal World that they did, and most times I would need a mod for such features is:

1) Being able to teleport/fast travel while over encumbered (while still being able to move)

2) Crafting stations take resources from chests.

I always assumed I would need the resources on me to craft, like so many other games. Didnt realize until later that it pulled resources from chests within the base boundary. I'm sure other games have done this, but just from the few that i've played it always require resources on your character.

I'm only about 7hrs in, playing solo and absolutely loving the game so far.
        Am I missing something? I built a base right among a bunch of iron and put some depressos down but they’re not touching them. Can’t figure it out.
    There are a fair number of spots with 4+ ore spots around. Once you unlock a second base, build one there and fill it up with Pals with the Mining lvl. 2+ ability, a few pals with transporting and some basic food production. The only chest should be built right next to the pal station.  
The mining pals will continuously mine the ore while the transporters gather it in the chest. Every once in a while you can teleport there, grab the ore and teleport back to your main base. Doesn't matter if you can't move with all the ore, as teleporting is still possible and in your base you can leapfrog the ore by dropping it, moving towards the closest chest and picking it up again.
    The weight is mostly why putting most of your level points into weight is the way to go. Not really a reason to use the points on attack since it increases it by like 2 and your digimons are usually the ones doing the damage
        Or you could just make a grappling hook.

No matter how over encumbered you are you can always use the grappling hook so its easy to move around huge amounts of stuff via your palbox teleport.
        You could use pals with weight increase passive for carrying(starting spots cats have it). I put like 3-4 points into carry weight but I feel like stamina and hp are better investment of points.
    I built my second run base literally in an area with like ten iron deposits in a ring, way up on a mountain too so I can glide to wherever.

Best decision as wood/stone I can generate infinite of, if my fucking foxpark would stop being fucking lazy I'm easily hitting like a thousand ingots in barely any time. Sucks he's bugged out but has the slacker debuff.

I purposefully got two miner skill and two logging skills to give me resources so I usually have a few hundred when I come back + my game bugged out really hard so I have six pals at my base doing everything but they're not actually at my base and don't lose hunger/motivation at all. They're just churning out resources like crazy and taking the occasional break.

Then I have my regular pals that I can actually interact with and they're churning out other stuff.

Plus my mate made a big house but he doesn't know if you crawl up a wall until you hit the ceiling you teleport into the room above you. I've been stealing shit from his locked house to fuck with him for the last two days and then escaping out the roof because he built a big overhang into his second floor.
Ark looked like a second job to me
    That's because ARK IS a second job. 

We had a group of friends all playing together, had a nice base, a bunch of nice dinosaurs, good gear, a nice farm, everything. 

We had all played hard this day, did a lot of work caught a bunch of dinos and everything, what one could call a hard days day of work. So at some point we call it a night and we all crawl into our beds, dead tired from the hard work of the day, well almost all of us. The one player that loved the farming stayed around, she's going around taking care of the farms and grabbing eggs. Thirty minutes-an hour go by and she starts hearing noises outside the base, she goes and checks it out and notices a few players sneaking around our base, she soon finds out that they are raiders, CHINESE RAIDERS! So she being outnumbered and the least PvP confident and least PvP experience player in our group panicks. She jumps on discord voice calling everyone to try to get some help (I think it might have been Skype at the time.), but no help is coming as everyone else is sleeping from their hard day of play/work. So she ends up just hiding there and watching this group of raiders destroy our base and kill our dinos.

6-8-10 hours later as the rest of the group wakes up, they notice the dozens of panicked calls for help, they all quickly jump on the game to witness the aftermath of the devastation with their own eyes and is baaad. There are a few dinos that are somehow still alive, maybe they were set to passive or something and the raiders didn't feel like wasting time killing them, but these are the lower level ones or ones without great stats, used for eggs or manure. Apart from these not good dinos a couple of walls here and there and a few boxes with stone or wood, everything else is gone.

So what is the point of this story? Well I guess you aren't allowed to have any off time from the game and if you do dare to take some time off you better have someone to stay and guard around the clock AND make sure everyone is reachable on their phone at all times so you can come in for emergency wor..I mean play during the weekends.
        That sounds miserable
Literally that, it looks so awful to play it without atleast x10 loot and honestly i prefer even higher
there are people that actually play ark on official servers where it has the default config...

Some people are really masochist in playing a survival game where GRIND is really fucking slow.
What I get from Palworld is that the base, the core, it's already built, there's a solid great stuff here with this direction.


They just need to improve it


 But as a early access, this sold the idea really well 
    From early looks its one of the most complete gameplay experiences that has entered "early access" in recent memory.
The power of outsourcing labour
The fun part is leveling is tied to capturing pals so you only worry about the part of making balls on your Chinese Sweatshop.

so you will still have some use for those pals that you ~~enslave~~ capture.
I'd like to add that Ark is only that grindy if you play on the official settings/servers, which isn't recommended by most players from my experience, unofficial servers and solo play offer a lot more reasonable grind rates.
    I've always avoided Ark because it seems too daunting. Is solo ark reasonable to do and enjoy (with said changed settings)? I've endured solo Valheim and loved it solo.
        Its not bad, but the big problem with Ark is the performance and file size optimization. Last I checked the whole install with DLC is well over 200GB, I had to manually run some windows file compacter tool to bring it down by more than half, and there was no performance impact from that.
        Solo or multi is not the real problem, pve is, last time i played the game it was absolutely not designed or balanced for it, its fine early on, but when it gets bad it does so extremely fast, it also has tons of time wasting, time sensitive mechanics designed to keep you online, its not quite as bad on singleplayer but they are still there.
    Not to mention you can re-tune the values everytime you join the game you created (well, solo anyway). So no worries if you over or undertuned some values (looking at you V Rising).
Gamespass would be the better trial imo cause then you get the catalog of everything else you can play for the month if not (plus intro price of like $1) yes am aware is behind the steam version but update is planned from what I've heard and I haven't had any issues with it yet
    Highly recommend this approach for people who aren't familiar with this type of game and assume this is just like Pokemon  
I tested it last night on Game Pass and decided the survival nature of it is just not for me
        You can tweak that as well down to like 0 or almost 0 which should help some but yea enough not like Pokemon that don't think it's just Pokemon
Ah I see I see, I actually purchased it after I made that comment and just played for about 5 hours straight with a friend, was not expecting to enjoy it that much
What is it, throwing one when they are too high hp to be caught?
Well, there's also the Butcher's Knife item that lets you butcher Pals that you've caught. My 9-year-old can't decide if he finds that disturbing or hilarious, but that's kind of the human condition, I guess. Nothing else in the game is nearly that disturbing, but it's a great platform for talking to your kids about how we treat animals in the real world, for better or worse.

edit: You can also capture "bad guys" and use them for your bidding, which is a little weird and might also be a bit unsettling depending. I feel like 7 is old enough to understand most of what's going on, but you might need to talk them through some things occasionally.
    > My 9-year-old can't decide if he finds that disturbing or hilarious

I'm 31 and same
    Just a heads-up, though you're unlikely to try yourself, uless you're really curious. You can butcher anything in a pal sphere, and anything in A pal sphere is considered a pal.


 Ergo you can use the butcher knife in humans, so avoid that lol
        I wondered. Thank you for filling in that gap in my knowledge. xD
Honestly, it's about as violent as Fortnite. If you think that's not appropriate for your kids, then this isn't either.
    It's weird. Having kids has made me way less judgmental toward other parents about almost everything, but as a game enjoyer, I am incredibly vigilant about my son's games and am surprised at what other parents allow.

It's not like my parents who didn't really understand games and ended up not doing much about it (basically the era that birthed the ESRB). 

Rather, I know exactly how addictive games can be and how much time (and ambition) they can suck up. I want him to enjoy games that enable his creativity and abilities, rather than stifling them. 

And that's not even addressing the content discussion. I saw what happened when our nephew was allowed to play games like Call of Duty at 5 or 6. The poor kid is a desensitized drone, and I think it's in no small part due to his mom allowing completely unmonitored/unrestricted gaming time. 

To be clear, I think this aspect is a symptom of their greater (lack of) parenting issues, but he's also never been given the privilege of getting to know who he is without a game to sink hours into.

Sorry. I don't know what about your comment sparked my gaming dad soapbox moment, but I hope somebody got something out of it.
Also y'know, the human slavery. And the 69th entry in the paldex (edit:  legitimately they made a pal whose thing is "it has breasts and wants to make love with everything" and made it number 69)
    Important to note that this specific Pal was actually going to be a different number at first, 49 I've heard. They changed it because of a suggestion for it to be 69 on their discord, which makes them good devs who have spent time listening to fans somewhat.
        >  which makes them good devs who have spent time listening to fans somewhat.

I can't work out if this is sarcastic as hearing this aspect just made me groan in annoyance even harder that the devs chose to cater to people who need to touch grass.
One of the first Pals has a description that says it's got the mental capacity of a human 5 to 7 year old, which is great up until they started figuring out how to use weapons and killed their trainers.
Problem is AI should not be associated with that. All games with NPCs use some sort of AI but not generative AI.
Man I remember playing Scarlet on release and didn’t have a single bug, not even the memory leak. The game was just hella unoptimized tho. So far palworld is the first paid Early Access game that has felt good to me, but I’ve also just played a lot of shitty early access titles lmao
I can't agree more, and I'm not even really interested in the game! It just makes me happy to see more options and interesting ideas out there.
Doing something you said you don’t like (and they weren’t even lmao) is definitely irony, you’re very good at using that word and you should keep doing it
Even one of the best is far fetched imo. The game does everything good. But is not great at anything.

Graphics are all right but they are not crazy either. Again, well executed but not great per se.

Combat is average, Valheim for example is way more engaging. Again the game execute well but isn't really great at combat.
    “One of the better…”, not *best*, and they said it twice. Just fucking read bro. There’s whole ass South Park episode about people like you.
        Lol. Chill out

You can say whatever you want and bitch on semantic (because it's all you have). The game is average at best for a game of that kind.

It does nothing bad but it does nothing great either.

There's dozens of games that do better in different aspect of it. It is just average at everything.
Yes, but BG3 eventually released.  This developer now has three games in Early Access, but neither of the first two are even close to a full release.
Larian had a history of delivering and finishing early access games, this studio has the opposite.
I don't think that's fair. Their early work (especially the first 3 gens) is clearly a labour of love. They put a lot of effort into those games and for the time they were incredible. And gen 3 still holds up in my opinion. 

They've been doing the same formula for a long time now, but it didn't start out that way.
[deleted]
Let's see, [4 million copies](https://www.pcgamer.com/that-pokemon-with-guns-game-palworld-just-sold-4-million-copies-in-3-days-and-it-isnt-slowing-down/) @ 26.99 dollars = 107.96 million dollars.

They've earned over 100 million dollars in just 4 days, they might be able to:

1. afford better offices/equipment
2. hire more developers
3. build a Scrooge McDuck money vault.
It also runs so much better than ark. Ark has lag spikes every minute even on solo, palword has stable 60fps constantly
True that.

But in terms of gameplay mechanics, isn't both Palworld and Ark similar to other games in the same genre? 

Base building from template structures, resource gathering (berries, stone, wood, smelting ore into ingots, etc.), weapon smithing, boss battling, world exploration, cave spelunking, different biomes, etc.

All these things are also things you can do/find in Valheim for instance.
    The systems for palworld are directly copy-pasted from Ark, they’re not just similar. The level progression is almost identical (level up, get points  to invest in escalating levels of tech, as well as picking small incremental stat upgrades). The monsters all serve a very specific function. The needing to craft specific saddles and harnesses to utilizes the monsters for their economic purpose.

Palworld takes most of its DNA from Ark, but it also has cherry-picked some things that worked in other recent innovative games. I see inspiration from BOTW/genshin, Elden ring, valheim, legends arceus, but this almost feels like an Ark mod with massive QOL inprovements.
Ahh right okay. I haven’t played Ark. Valheim does have farming, but it’s not the focus of the game
Now, let me show you my favorite pal.
You mean Devil Fruits. :D
Simple and deep can coexist. Its very easy to walk up to an enemy and just swing your sword until they die. But then you learn about perfect dodges and bullet time, which gives some nice depth while staying simple. Then you have the runes, which bombs alone are crazy, as well as shield partying, sneak strikes, head shots, etc that give you so many options to use. Not to mention weapons breaking and dealing critical damage and timing that to throw them for a final burst of damage.

The combat is simple, yes, but the further you delve the deeper it gets. Just look up the crazy combat clips and you'll get what I'm saying. Palworld doesn't have that depth.
    That's a fair assessment in comparison to Pal World, least, though I can't say I really find it any more interesting or engaging than most other modern AAA games.
As someone who doesn't get it, it objectively is. Achieving 3 million sales in 48 hours and having an active player base of over 1 million on steam is groundbreaking for what was a relatively unknown developer. Even if those numbers crash and burn in say a week.
    Thing is, this game isn’t something people will remember in like 5-10 years. No one in 10 years will be like remember Palword? Good times. No, because it’s a flavor of the month game that doesn’t have longevity. Compare it to something like Minecraft that people talk about to this day. It’s a sudden spike in popularity but I predict it will crash and burn very fast and be forgotten soon.
        Even if that's true, it's still worth to play and enjoy something even for a short period of time. The game is genuine fun and unique imo. Will I be playing it in a month or two? Don't know, but I've already gotten my money's worth (GamePass) and enjoyed my time.
        They will remember it because it’s in the history books now, you can’t look up top purchased game on steam without seeing Palworld
He’s objectively correct?
I’m not just making that up… go look
>Crashes/bugs

Yes

>limited keybinds (french keyboard have that weird thing where "4" and the "$" symbol are inverted, so I have to type "MAJ+$" to get "4", but it doesn't work in game, I just can't repair buildings)

Don't see how that's the game's problem, how about using a normal keyboard.

> Stats balance

You're the one that puts the stat points on the character, so that does sound like skill issue.

> tech points acquisition solo vs multiplayer balance. (basically the whole progression system is janky)

There's not a difference between solo and multiplayer unless the host decides to change it.

> Pal balance

Don't know what you mean with this.

>- NPC's are barebone.

Somewhat yes.

>The texts aren't all there yet (lots of "en text" as descriptions)

Didn't have this problem with the spanish translation so far.

> generic UI

I've seen worse but yes.

>No "exit the game" button, I have to either switch to window mode or kill it with the task manager.

Straight up false. You only need to press ESC and the last option in the menu allows you to exit your save and then exit the game.
[deleted]
    Are you actually trolling? Am i just being wooshed really badly? Also you just totally didnt read my response because i already said that i have maxed out the capture rate and it still feels bad. Its about as engaging as actual pokemon catching because you just stand there waiting for the sphere to fail and throw again multiple times in a row in higher levels.

You just sound like a fanboy at this moment because we cant criticize your beloved pokemon killer or some shit like that.

I played the game and said what i feel about it, hopefully most of my problems get fixed with patches along the early access updates, but im writing about current problems.

Fuck off again
        [deleted]
            I really fell for it man lmao gj :D
                still have yet to respond to any of my rebuttals. Have a good day little guy 
                    Cmon man you can stop already :P the jig is up :D
Some of us aren’t good sailors 😅
> Yes Craftopia is still in Early Access, but it receives regular and frequent updates

Worth noting they cut the pace of development by two thirds after announcing Palworld. Seems a lot of development resources were moved off that project.
Like i said, i have no interest in this game and was genuinely asking if this game is actually any good or if it was just a meme, which led to everyone buying it to try it out.
    so try it out if you want to know lmao, opinions are subjective you know, giving criticism like "the game looks janky" when you haven't even touched the game feels a little strange to me. 

it sounds like you already have a preconceived notion of what to feel about the game in your head and all you want is validation tbh
    Good is subjective. Pretty easy to figure out if the game is a meme or not
“Games take a long time to make so it’s bad when an early access game also takes a long time to make”
Star citizen is still in alpha after 10 years of development, still its a game. Buggy mess but still a game.

There is no point complaining just released early acces(alpha or beta) stage game as unfinished.

Thats why its called early acces. Devs try probably finance further development or then its money grab.

Anyway, for me it has been fun experience so far.

If you dont like unfinished games, dont buy earlyacces games.
I just don't see it. It's a survival game. Lmfao. It literally let's you automate two of the games most basic resources early. It rewards you for exploring and getting new pals. 

Just sounds like it just isn't your kind of game.
and slavery as well.
    My favorite
    You can basically do that in Ark, it's just instead of making them work you force feed them poop as they waste away in a cage
        that's torture not slavery, sir. Get your human rights violations in order.
Also, it is designed more with 2 players or single players in mind. Vs ark, which is designed to be played with multiple players.
    Dang.  Was hoping to co-op with my 3 friends.  Is it available to play this way at all?
        You definitely can. It is up to 32 players with a dedicated server, and I think 4 with normal in game hosting.
Ark, but it respects your time and I don’t have to clear acres of land just to get a decent level 1 base
Probably the biggest advantage Palworld has over Ark (specifically for your gaming platform) is that Palworld is just under 7 gigabytes in size, compared to over a hundred for Ark (these sizes are from the Xbox versions, they might be different on steam).

The second biggest is that everything is adorable in Palworld.
    I think Ark crosses the 200GB mark on PC with all dlcs. It’s a poorly coded game and absolutely massive.
yeh ark was always about collecting/taming  "monsters" even without the pokeballs
Fire Wyvern used flamethrower. Enemy Dodo fainted.
Those dinosaurs can't farm, mine, log, and build equipment and structures for me while I go catch more though, soooooooo.
    Well, some can, but that's kind of moot because they can't do that in Pokemon either.
I was tempted to buy it, not for the Pokemon (been a fan since 5 years old) feel but more because it gave me Ark vibes. I wanted to feel that first time playing Ark feeling again. Seeing a dodo for the first time and taming it but it being a Pal in this case.

But back to your point, it does feel and look more casual, that's why I was tempted to play it but then I got turned off with the real time egg hatching mechanics but then found out at a later date you can change these sorts of settings. Letting players change this will bring in a lot more casual play.
    Yeah although those settings could use some work. For example, say you wanted to reduce  egg incubation times, they can be set to half at the 2nd lowest setting or have no incubation time at all iirc.
    So Ive plopped about 8hrs into it, and while i have found a few eggs, I havent even gotten to the incubation part, but thats (so far) not a large part of collecting pals.   I think (I barely played it, and forever ago) Ark puts a massive amount of 'game time' into eggs / breeding that Palworld does not.
How does it matter? Temten with cards to catch monsters is more like pokemon then palworld with balls. Thats the point.
    well temtem is a clone of pokemon (and a mediocre one at best), this takes an aspect of pokemon, that other games, including ark, took when enough years passed to get away with it.

while also almost certainly taking pokemon assets and morphing and mixing them into new shapes and definitely taking pokemon textures and slapping those onto new models (which in turn are at times also taken from other places, like the totoro one).

they didnt just copy the design philosophy and gave it their own spin.
        \> they didnt just copy the design philosophy and gave it their own spin.

Right, its just an additional game mechanic introduced to valheim philosophy. thats the point. The pokemon (maingames) philosophy has much more then just catching funny monsters with balls. everything besides that is missing.

idk whenever i read people comparing it to a pokemon game it feels like they never played a pokemon game before. Its confusing.
    Because saying the comparison isn’t valid while it’s literally the only game with that exact system makes it a fair comparison to say it’s like Pokémon mixed with arc. It’s not as simple as “doom shoots monsters” when there’s literally thousands of games that shoot monsters but like 1 that captures monsters in balls n shit lol
The creatures and moves have types. So far, I've seen normal, dark, grass, and dragon in the first 3 hours.
>But it's mostly you doing the fighting while your pet autoattacks randomly.

Except they deal significantly more damage and are better at fighting than you.

Even thugs if you capture them 

>I didn't see any way to command the pet or teach it specific things

What are you talking about 
There are literally skill fruits that work JUST like TMs do

>It levels up by doing non combat shit like chopping trees at your base.

You mean....like PLA did when you were doing things like gathering and stealth catching awarding relatively minor amounts of exp? 

>The core of the combat is in no way similar to the turn based combat from the Pokémon franchise.

Pst, pokemon SV literally has an auto battle function, which while not going through individual attacks like PW, is the same basic thing.
    I'll have to take your word for it. I played the game 30 minutes and uninstalled. 

I like the turn based combat of Pokémon, and I have zero interest in base building, survival, and crafting mechanics. 

It's just not a game for me.
        a moment of silence for the men and women who got scammed by everybody saying "its pokemon with guns" 

RIP your 30$ friend
It's not "exactly" the same but its pretty damn similar. And yes you can teach moves and command them, but it's not turn based. That's the difference. Iirc some of the more recent Pokémon games have ditched the turned based combat as well...
    Pokémon is turn based, none of the recent games have removed that. At most Legends: Arceus had a slightly modified turn order (not strict 1 turn per Pokémon, it depended on speed), but it was still turn based. 

And the Pals in Palworld aren’t able to be controlled beyond picking skills or using specific active skills (like turning Foxparks into a flamethrower that the player wields). Palworld is definitely more of a normal action combat game than it is Pokémon.
        Well if you are on a mount you get full control over the pal's moves but I get your point. 

Aside from the battling though, collecting the pals, levelling them up, etc it's got a lot in common with Pokémon. I would even argue this is closer to where Pokémon should be these days if game freak weren't so hell bent on holding it back.
            Moving away from turned-based would be a big FU to the competitive scene.
                Their recent work has been a big FU to the entire scene over and over again for decades really though hasn't it.

Edit: downvoted eh. We just gonna act like the Pokémon games are good these days? Lol
                    I've enjoyed VGC in this gen significantly more than the last one, probably more than gen 6 as well.
The strange expectations for a non online service game to maintain its population is the crazier thing.
    Yep, the obsession with steam numbers on a non always-online live service game is tiring. Not to mention that Palworld will have a dedicated modding scene since Pokemon modding has been on overdrive since the 2010s. Apparently there's already a Pokemon overhaul mod.
        Holy, you opened eyes, if this game get good a good modding scene it may live forever.


Like, just new Mod pals would already be big


There's a gold mine here
            New mod pals plus modders can go ham with whatever they want to add since Palworld itself isn't restricted to one genre unlike other games. For all we know there's mods expanding pal combat while there are mods expanding the fps mechanic or mods expanding the automation side while all looking good. That's the great positive of using a modern engine like Unreal Engine 5.

And it's funny that there's already a [Pokemon replacement mod](https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1749381513001767167)  , so if they can do that what's stopping them from adding gym/elite 4 npcs and you get to fight their pokemons in real time at the towers instead of being static like the mainline games.

Ideas so good I can feel the copyright strikes even before it's publicly released. That's how this game lives on even if devs abandon it.
                Add full modsupport and they will sell 10mill

There would be full pokemon mods within a week
LOL .... goodfellas is one of the few movies - along with pulp fiction and a few others that I would always watch if I hit on it while channel surfing.

[edikt: numerous spelling fixes]
I mean that's exactly what I said. The grind that can be skipped with microtransactions is the most MMO thing. 

And honestly they could have skipped that. By giving it MMO aspects they basically increased their own running costs as it meant they had to maintain servers for running the game. If they had just kept it as a modest pokemon clone they wouldn't need to try and do battle passes.
    It could have still been massively multiplayer. A Pokémon clone with a persistent overworld and some pvp / co-op elements seemed to be what they were going for. But MMOs don't inherently need to be evil, they just benefit a lot from it.

Personally I think the private server route is better for games like this and Minecraft.
    That is just straight up wrong. Microtransactions don't give you any game advantages or "skip the grind" as you called it. They are purely cosmetic.
Ark added paid dlc expansions before releasing the original game out of early access lol

How did the developers previous game go?


Edit - just checked. Still in early access.
True. What helps is a second base at an iron spot and let pals do the work of gathering that stuff into a chest next to your palbox. Pick up all, teleport to main Base, unpack into chest next to your palbox there. Done.
    Yup. You unlock the second base just in time to start needing tons of iron. It's pretty clear they intended it to be a mining base.
        And the pals doing work for you, somebody definitely got tired of having to do everything themselves in ark.
            I haven't played ark but i could understand that from other survival games. The automation is so nice to have.
                I especially love how organic it is. No need to micromanage. The pals can be specifically instructed, or left to their own devices, and they get shit *done*.
                    Except the fuckin penguin and fox keep leaving their posts. I NEED THAT FRIDGE COLD AND MY INGOTS HOT DAMMIT WHY DID YOU TELEPORT ONTO THE BATTLEMENT
        And you get a third base the moment you start to get the next ingot, so yeah, secondary bases are meant to be gathering.
        Oh thank god I was wondering how I was going to manage ore
        Can your bases get raided while you are not there?  
Will walls help or does the enemy just destroy them?  
what do sand bags actually do?
    It's actually worth smelting it in the same place you farm it and then just move the ingots (as they weigh less and you get more space for crafting in your main base). 4 pals with level 3 mining can get more than 8 deposits before they respawn. So there is plenty of space for 2 carriers and two/three smelters.
        This guy palworlds!
            Or Factorio'es. Or Satisfactories.
    Yep, and I already have 2 or 3 spots marked on my map as candidates for the second base for iron.
    What I really loved in Pal World that they did, and most times I would need a mod for such features is:

1) Being able to teleport/fast travel while over encumbered (while still being able to move)

2) Crafting stations take resources from chests.

I always assumed I would need the resources on me to craft, like so many other games. Didnt realize until later that it pulled resources from chests within the base boundary. I'm sure other games have done this, but just from the few that i've played it always require resources on your character.

I'm only about 7hrs in, playing solo and absolutely loving the game so far.
    Am I missing something? I built a base right among a bunch of iron and put some depressos down but they’re not touching them. Can’t figure it out.
There are a fair number of spots with 4+ ore spots around. Once you unlock a second base, build one there and fill it up with Pals with the Mining lvl. 2+ ability, a few pals with transporting and some basic food production. The only chest should be built right next to the pal station.  
The mining pals will continuously mine the ore while the transporters gather it in the chest. Every once in a while you can teleport there, grab the ore and teleport back to your main base. Doesn't matter if you can't move with all the ore, as teleporting is still possible and in your base you can leapfrog the ore by dropping it, moving towards the closest chest and picking it up again.
The weight is mostly why putting most of your level points into weight is the way to go. Not really a reason to use the points on attack since it increases it by like 2 and your digimons are usually the ones doing the damage
    Or you could just make a grappling hook.

No matter how over encumbered you are you can always use the grappling hook so its easy to move around huge amounts of stuff via your palbox teleport.
    You could use pals with weight increase passive for carrying(starting spots cats have it). I put like 3-4 points into carry weight but I feel like stamina and hp are better investment of points.
I built my second run base literally in an area with like ten iron deposits in a ring, way up on a mountain too so I can glide to wherever.

Best decision as wood/stone I can generate infinite of, if my fucking foxpark would stop being fucking lazy I'm easily hitting like a thousand ingots in barely any time. Sucks he's bugged out but has the slacker debuff.

I purposefully got two miner skill and two logging skills to give me resources so I usually have a few hundred when I come back + my game bugged out really hard so I have six pals at my base doing everything but they're not actually at my base and don't lose hunger/motivation at all. They're just churning out resources like crazy and taking the occasional break.

Then I have my regular pals that I can actually interact with and they're churning out other stuff.

Plus my mate made a big house but he doesn't know if you crawl up a wall until you hit the ceiling you teleport into the room above you. I've been stealing shit from his locked house to fuck with him for the last two days and then escaping out the roof because he built a big overhang into his second floor.
That's because ARK IS a second job. 

We had a group of friends all playing together, had a nice base, a bunch of nice dinosaurs, good gear, a nice farm, everything. 

We had all played hard this day, did a lot of work caught a bunch of dinos and everything, what one could call a hard days day of work. So at some point we call it a night and we all crawl into our beds, dead tired from the hard work of the day, well almost all of us. The one player that loved the farming stayed around, she's going around taking care of the farms and grabbing eggs. Thirty minutes-an hour go by and she starts hearing noises outside the base, she goes and checks it out and notices a few players sneaking around our base, she soon finds out that they are raiders, CHINESE RAIDERS! So she being outnumbered and the least PvP confident and least PvP experience player in our group panicks. She jumps on discord voice calling everyone to try to get some help (I think it might have been Skype at the time.), but no help is coming as everyone else is sleeping from their hard day of play/work. So she ends up just hiding there and watching this group of raiders destroy our base and kill our dinos.

6-8-10 hours later as the rest of the group wakes up, they notice the dozens of panicked calls for help, they all quickly jump on the game to witness the aftermath of the devastation with their own eyes and is baaad. There are a few dinos that are somehow still alive, maybe they were set to passive or something and the raiders didn't feel like wasting time killing them, but these are the lower level ones or ones without great stats, used for eggs or manure. Apart from these not good dinos a couple of walls here and there and a few boxes with stone or wood, everything else is gone.

So what is the point of this story? Well I guess you aren't allowed to have any off time from the game and if you do dare to take some time off you better have someone to stay and guard around the clock AND make sure everyone is reachable on their phone at all times so you can come in for emergency wor..I mean play during the weekends.
    That sounds miserable
From early looks its one of the most complete gameplay experiences that has entered "early access" in recent memory.
I've always avoided Ark because it seems too daunting. Is solo ark reasonable to do and enjoy (with said changed settings)? I've endured solo Valheim and loved it solo.
    Its not bad, but the big problem with Ark is the performance and file size optimization. Last I checked the whole install with DLC is well over 200GB, I had to manually run some windows file compacter tool to bring it down by more than half, and there was no performance impact from that.
    Solo or multi is not the real problem, pve is, last time i played the game it was absolutely not designed or balanced for it, its fine early on, but when it gets bad it does so extremely fast, it also has tons of time wasting, time sensitive mechanics designed to keep you online, its not quite as bad on singleplayer but they are still there.
Not to mention you can re-tune the values everytime you join the game you created (well, solo anyway). So no worries if you over or undertuned some values (looking at you V Rising).
Highly recommend this approach for people who aren't familiar with this type of game and assume this is just like Pokemon  
I tested it last night on Game Pass and decided the survival nature of it is just not for me
    You can tweak that as well down to like 0 or almost 0 which should help some but yea enough not like Pokemon that don't think it's just Pokemon
> My 9-year-old can't decide if he finds that disturbing or hilarious

I'm 31 and same
Just a heads-up, though you're unlikely to try yourself, uless you're really curious. You can butcher anything in a pal sphere, and anything in A pal sphere is considered a pal.


 Ergo you can use the butcher knife in humans, so avoid that lol
    I wondered. Thank you for filling in that gap in my knowledge. xD
It's weird. Having kids has made me way less judgmental toward other parents about almost everything, but as a game enjoyer, I am incredibly vigilant about my son's games and am surprised at what other parents allow.

It's not like my parents who didn't really understand games and ended up not doing much about it (basically the era that birthed the ESRB). 

Rather, I know exactly how addictive games can be and how much time (and ambition) they can suck up. I want him to enjoy games that enable his creativity and abilities, rather than stifling them. 

And that's not even addressing the content discussion. I saw what happened when our nephew was allowed to play games like Call of Duty at 5 or 6. The poor kid is a desensitized drone, and I think it's in no small part due to his mom allowing completely unmonitored/unrestricted gaming time. 

To be clear, I think this aspect is a symptom of their greater (lack of) parenting issues, but he's also never been given the privilege of getting to know who he is without a game to sink hours into.

Sorry. I don't know what about your comment sparked my gaming dad soapbox moment, but I hope somebody got something out of it.
Important to note that this specific Pal was actually going to be a different number at first, 49 I've heard. They changed it because of a suggestion for it to be 69 on their discord, which makes them good devs who have spent time listening to fans somewhat.
    >  which makes them good devs who have spent time listening to fans somewhat.

I can't work out if this is sarcastic as hearing this aspect just made me groan in annoyance even harder that the devs chose to cater to people who need to touch grass.
“One of the better…”, not *best*, and they said it twice. Just fucking read bro. There’s whole ass South Park episode about people like you.
    Lol. Chill out

You can say whatever you want and bitch on semantic (because it's all you have). The game is average at best for a game of that kind.

It does nothing bad but it does nothing great either.

There's dozens of games that do better in different aspect of it. It is just average at everything.
The systems for palworld are directly copy-pasted from Ark, they’re not just similar. The level progression is almost identical (level up, get points  to invest in escalating levels of tech, as well as picking small incremental stat upgrades). The monsters all serve a very specific function. The needing to craft specific saddles and harnesses to utilizes the monsters for their economic purpose.

Palworld takes most of its DNA from Ark, but it also has cherry-picked some things that worked in other recent innovative games. I see inspiration from BOTW/genshin, Elden ring, valheim, legends arceus, but this almost feels like an Ark mod with massive QOL inprovements.
That's a fair assessment in comparison to Pal World, least, though I can't say I really find it any more interesting or engaging than most other modern AAA games.
Thing is, this game isn’t something people will remember in like 5-10 years. No one in 10 years will be like remember Palword? Good times. No, because it’s a flavor of the month game that doesn’t have longevity. Compare it to something like Minecraft that people talk about to this day. It’s a sudden spike in popularity but I predict it will crash and burn very fast and be forgotten soon.
    Even if that's true, it's still worth to play and enjoy something even for a short period of time. The game is genuine fun and unique imo. Will I be playing it in a month or two? Don't know, but I've already gotten my money's worth (GamePass) and enjoyed my time.
    They will remember it because it’s in the history books now, you can’t look up top purchased game on steam without seeing Palworld
Are you actually trolling? Am i just being wooshed really badly? Also you just totally didnt read my response because i already said that i have maxed out the capture rate and it still feels bad. Its about as engaging as actual pokemon catching because you just stand there waiting for the sphere to fail and throw again multiple times in a row in higher levels.

You just sound like a fanboy at this moment because we cant criticize your beloved pokemon killer or some shit like that.

I played the game and said what i feel about it, hopefully most of my problems get fixed with patches along the early access updates, but im writing about current problems.

Fuck off again

        I really fell for it man lmao gj :D
            still have yet to respond to any of my rebuttals. Have a good day little guy 
                Cmon man you can stop already :P the jig is up :D
so try it out if you want to know lmao, opinions are subjective you know, giving criticism like "the game looks janky" when you haven't even touched the game feels a little strange to me. 

it sounds like you already have a preconceived notion of what to feel about the game in your head and all you want is validation tbh
Good is subjective. Pretty easy to figure out if the game is a meme or not
My favorite
You can basically do that in Ark, it's just instead of making them work you force feed them poop as they waste away in a cage
    that's torture not slavery, sir. Get your human rights violations in order.
Dang.  Was hoping to co-op with my 3 friends.  Is it available to play this way at all?
    You definitely can. It is up to 32 players with a dedicated server, and I think 4 with normal in game hosting.
I think Ark crosses the 200GB mark on PC with all dlcs. It’s a poorly coded game and absolutely massive.
Well, some can, but that's kind of moot because they can't do that in Pokemon either.
Yeah although those settings could use some work. For example, say you wanted to reduce  egg incubation times, they can be set to half at the 2nd lowest setting or have no incubation time at all iirc.
So Ive plopped about 8hrs into it, and while i have found a few eggs, I havent even gotten to the incubation part, but thats (so far) not a large part of collecting pals.   I think (I barely played it, and forever ago) Ark puts a massive amount of 'game time' into eggs / breeding that Palworld does not.
well temtem is a clone of pokemon (and a mediocre one at best), this takes an aspect of pokemon, that other games, including ark, took when enough years passed to get away with it.

while also almost certainly taking pokemon assets and morphing and mixing them into new shapes and definitely taking pokemon textures and slapping those onto new models (which in turn are at times also taken from other places, like the totoro one).

they didnt just copy the design philosophy and gave it their own spin.
    \> they didnt just copy the design philosophy and gave it their own spin.

Right, its just an additional game mechanic introduced to valheim philosophy. thats the point. The pokemon (maingames) philosophy has much more then just catching funny monsters with balls. everything besides that is missing.

idk whenever i read people comparing it to a pokemon game it feels like they never played a pokemon game before. Its confusing.
Because saying the comparison isn’t valid while it’s literally the only game with that exact system makes it a fair comparison to say it’s like Pokémon mixed with arc. It’s not as simple as “doom shoots monsters” when there’s literally thousands of games that shoot monsters but like 1 that captures monsters in balls n shit lol
I'll have to take your word for it. I played the game 30 minutes and uninstalled. 

I like the turn based combat of Pokémon, and I have zero interest in base building, survival, and crafting mechanics. 

It's just not a game for me.
    a moment of silence for the men and women who got scammed by everybody saying "its pokemon with guns" 

RIP your 30$ friend
Pokémon is turn based, none of the recent games have removed that. At most Legends: Arceus had a slightly modified turn order (not strict 1 turn per Pokémon, it depended on speed), but it was still turn based. 

And the Pals in Palworld aren’t able to be controlled beyond picking skills or using specific active skills (like turning Foxparks into a flamethrower that the player wields). Palworld is definitely more of a normal action combat game than it is Pokémon.
    Well if you are on a mount you get full control over the pal's moves but I get your point. 

Aside from the battling though, collecting the pals, levelling them up, etc it's got a lot in common with Pokémon. I would even argue this is closer to where Pokémon should be these days if game freak weren't so hell bent on holding it back.
        Moving away from turned-based would be a big FU to the competitive scene.
            Their recent work has been a big FU to the entire scene over and over again for decades really though hasn't it.

Edit: downvoted eh. We just gonna act like the Pokémon games are good these days? Lol
                I've enjoyed VGC in this gen significantly more than the last one, probably more than gen 6 as well.
Yep, the obsession with steam numbers on a non always-online live service game is tiring. Not to mention that Palworld will have a dedicated modding scene since Pokemon modding has been on overdrive since the 2010s. Apparently there's already a Pokemon overhaul mod.
    Holy, you opened eyes, if this game get good a good modding scene it may live forever.


Like, just new Mod pals would already be big


There's a gold mine here
        New mod pals plus modders can go ham with whatever they want to add since Palworld itself isn't restricted to one genre unlike other games. For all we know there's mods expanding pal combat while there are mods expanding the fps mechanic or mods expanding the automation side while all looking good. That's the great positive of using a modern engine like Unreal Engine 5.

And it's funny that there's already a [Pokemon replacement mod](https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1749381513001767167)  , so if they can do that what's stopping them from adding gym/elite 4 npcs and you get to fight their pokemons in real time at the towers instead of being static like the mainline games.

Ideas so good I can feel the copyright strikes even before it's publicly released. That's how this game lives on even if devs abandon it.
            Add full modsupport and they will sell 10mill

There would be full pokemon mods within a week
It could have still been massively multiplayer. A Pokémon clone with a persistent overworld and some pvp / co-op elements seemed to be what they were going for. But MMOs don't inherently need to be evil, they just benefit a lot from it.

Personally I think the private server route is better for games like this and Minecraft.
That is just straight up wrong. Microtransactions don't give you any game advantages or "skip the grind" as you called it. They are purely cosmetic.
Yup. You unlock the second base just in time to start needing tons of iron. It's pretty clear they intended it to be a mining base.
    And the pals doing work for you, somebody definitely got tired of having to do everything themselves in ark.
        I haven't played ark but i could understand that from other survival games. The automation is so nice to have.
            I especially love how organic it is. No need to micromanage. The pals can be specifically instructed, or left to their own devices, and they get shit *done*.
                Except the fuckin penguin and fox keep leaving their posts. I NEED THAT FRIDGE COLD AND MY INGOTS HOT DAMMIT WHY DID YOU TELEPORT ONTO THE BATTLEMENT
    And you get a third base the moment you start to get the next ingot, so yeah, secondary bases are meant to be gathering.
    Oh thank god I was wondering how I was going to manage ore
    Can your bases get raided while you are not there?  
Will walls help or does the enemy just destroy them?  
what do sand bags actually do?
It's actually worth smelting it in the same place you farm it and then just move the ingots (as they weigh less and you get more space for crafting in your main base). 4 pals with level 3 mining can get more than 8 deposits before they respawn. So there is plenty of space for 2 carriers and two/three smelters.
    This guy palworlds!
        Or Factorio'es. Or Satisfactories.
