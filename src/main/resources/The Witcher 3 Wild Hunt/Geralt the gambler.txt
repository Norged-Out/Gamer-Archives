[[Geralt the gambler]]





This is because Geralt never loses :¬)
    *saves*

*loses*

*loads save*

Repeat
        Yeah good luck doing that in the Skellige deck tournament in Blood & Wine
            I’ve just completed that quest and I felt so blessed that it autosaves between matches
                IT FUCKING WHAT?! Every time i play through the Witcher i do that quest, and everytime I've just made a manual save before the quest and loaded back to it. Now I learn that I don't have to cry my way through it every time I lose the last game
                    Yes!! I lost my second match and was raging that I’d have to take my chances with the guy who wants my sword and then voila! Noticed a lovely checkpoint save after I’d beaten him
                        It does fucking not auto save. Unless this is some console v pc bullshittery I lost that so many times and had to restart the whole fucking thing it’s not funny
                            Mine definitely auto saved on PS4. I was fuming because I lost the second match and it just reverted to the beginning of that rather than the whole quest
                                Autosaves on Xbox as well.
                Bruh, I didn't know this. I think I played the tournament for an hour or two, then accept my loss. Skellige deck is ass. Can't beat the dude with Nilfgard deck. So many spies 😂😂
            no reak need, skellige is mad overpowered
                I don’t know man the skellige deck fucking sucks.
                    Skellige deck is the only deck capable of beating a NR spy deck. It’s just heavily dependent on card synergy.
                        What about a Nilfgaardian spy deck? lol.
                            Ceres and a commander horn is an automatic 85  if you can get it. That and some decoy cards is all it really takes to beat nilfguard
                                I know what you need, but....    

1. You have to actually draw them, and if you don't, tough luck. Because you aren't getting anymore cards (unless you're able to decoy a spy).      

And 2. Even if you pull them, that might win you one round. If they play all their spies and give a round to you, you'll be screwed just based of pure numbers. They might have 14+ cards while you have 6.
                        No my NR spy deck beats every deck including another NR spy deck
                    then you don't know how to use it honestly
                        That deck is entirely dependent on luck. If you don't get Cerys and berserkers and the fungus you are fucked
                            It’s not bad if you tailor your deck specifically for the person you’re against, it’s just not ideal for “one build beats all”. Even after winning the tournament, I immediately switched back to my Northern Realms deck lol
                            I had full northern realms spy deck before I started the DLC, and switched to skelig for the tournament. And sure drawing Cerys means you've pretty much guaranteed won the round, but that's still just one round you've won, and I found it very possible to win almost every single game I played on Skelig, even games I didn't draw Cerys on.
                            If you don’t draw your win conditions then you lose? I’d have never guessed.
                            I don't have any berserkers in my deck
                        It takes a bit of luck, and then it's decent, but it has no spies. Beating the guy that uses the Nilfgaardian deck is really hard. You need decoys to take his spies and fight fire with fire.
                Northern Realms baby!
            Fuck Skellige deck I hate it so much
            When I read that I felt how fucking lucky I must've been for winning it on the first try. Think I had one game that was "close" but RNG is the game
            Gwent is easy bruv
        Nah the real OG’s don’t lose.
        A skill I learned playing Pazaak in KOTOR. If the AI cheats, why can't I?
    Edge of tomorrow!
        Live. Gwent. Repeat.
        What's new? LOL
    Or... Have you seen the two swords on his back and a PLOUGHING GRIFFIN HEAD hanging from his horse?
[deleted]
    Well, real life doesn't always mean player is having fun. This would make players save&reload games before or never dare to touch Gwent because of possibility to lose for real.
Lot of things doesn't make sense in games, because it wouldn't be fun. Developers wouldn't have any issue to disable skipping time, eating one only meal per hour or forcing Gerald to find toilet after few hours.
        The Gwent tournament makes you reload if you want to win it. I doubt anyone could win the tournament first time through.
            Yeah, I wont the 3 rounds on frist try but lost many time to the final guy and because gwent is many time about luck you would need to be extra lucky to win it first try
                Weird, because I found the final guy the easiest. He plays the monster deck which is very easy to counter so all it took was a biting frost and villentretenmerth in quick succession, and his entire row was cleaned out lmao 

I did have some trouble with Sasha though. She plays like most irl players do - spamming the shit out of spies and medics, only for more spies. By the end of the game, I had literally drawn my entire Nilfgaardian deck of 28 cards.
                    Sometimes the monster deck NPCs get a shit hand (=no cards that call reinforcements) but you won't know it until you have used up all your other cards besides biting frost and the scorch dragon guy while waiting for their good stuff to come up. Then you have to either hold and lose the round or use them and be left with like a single card on the next round. Then it's all luck which card the NPC gets to keep with their faction passive.

And sometimes you just don't get biting frost or scorch dragon guy at all. It happens.
                    My monster deck counter strategy was spamming my spies and then just trying to draw out as many of their cards as possible and take the L on the first round and then sweep the next rounds because they have no cards. Found the weather cards of limited use so they just take up deck/hand space for spies, medics, and decoys.
                        Yup, I always love when they play a muster card, and their card count drops by 3 or 4.  Nice to get them from your deck, but that's a big disadvantage if it plays them from your hand.
                        if you play against monsters without biting frost idk what to say
            Yes, but you do not loose any of your cards, you can still finish the quest (in most cases)

Gwent tournament was ok, until that damned fist-fight out of nowhere appeared. That made me reload game more than 20x. And Gerald got killed for real with fists.
                But fist fights are piss easy. All you have to do is open up some distance between you and your opponent, forcing them to advance and, while they swing a heavy blow, simply parry and counterattack.
                    Well, I know now. Before I have avoided fights as much as posible, didn't even know I can dodge quickly into directions. So I got stuck by learning to fist-fight with one of the hardest oponents. Also in few quest fights before didn't have such fatal consequences as death and game over.
                        So you just completely bypassed the tutorial fights the game gives you to hold your hand with combat? I don’t see how you could not know about dodging otherwise. Moreover, there’s a tutorial fistfight in white orchard to make sure you’re competent - did you do that?
                            I don't remember. It is hard to keep in mind tutorial from 2-3 months ago telling about keybind that isn't used for anything else. I won few fights in main quest, but these were quite easy to do without any strategy.
                >Gwent tournament was ok, until that damned fist-fight out of nowhere appeared. That made me reload game more than 20x. And Gerald got killed for real with fists.

This! His scoia'tael deck was a piece of cake and I was almost laughing, but then he started throwing punches. Even worse, I had taken the quest when I was around 8 levels below recommended so that wasn't very fun.
                    And very unexpected with fatal consequences. I have barely won against Baron and avoided all fist fights after. When this fight appeared, I didn't even knew I was able to dodge in directions. 
After many tries, I managed to win and It also gave me confidence to try other fist fights. 
If I think about it, if you avoid all minigames like Gwent, fist fights or horce races, you will always learn these the hard way later.
                        Do I really have to play gwent? I'm ln my first playthrough, but that's boring for me, I don't wanna do any of that lol, I haven't even gotten the first important cards from the first gwent quest
                            I have found it boring too at start, but after I got better cards, I like it a lot now. Winning is geat!  :)  It is good to have some decent deck, in few quests, you will play Gwent and also in some you will get quite different outcome and consequences if you win/loose. Also Gwent quests in journal will give you xp and rare cards.
                                So how much does the AI challenge you?
                                    I have played at normal dificulty. Some people can be quite challenge, especialy at Gwent tournament, but I quite liked the way that you first need to play and see what kind of deck opponent has and build your deck to counter it, refining your strategy.. Once you have decent deck, you can win around 85% games on first try.
                    I'm sorry what's this levels thing everyone keeps talking about.
                Such a long load time as well! So annoying!
            I won the gwent tournament in Toussant, but i lost the Novigrad one, it seems i can still get the cards i just have a harder time.
                I was able to win both the Toussant and Novigrad tournaments my first try.  The one I lost was the Wedding one in Hearts of Stone where you have to end up wearing the donkey ears.
            Definitely remember beating io first try
            I actually did win every game first time but I already had a very good deck at that time
            I was lucky, I won first try
            In my second playthrough I actually won the whole thing without savescumming. I used my foltest siege deck and somehow won lol.

I'm not saying I'm super skilled, but lady luck was on my side.
            I won it my first and only time with no difficulty
        Oh you were bitten by a wild dog? Better take  two weeks to recover from the wound and the mild infection.
            fallout 1-3
        See Triple Triad in FF VIII or Tetra Master in FF IX. Obviously, I can't speak for everyone but I'm sure I wasn't the only one running to a save point before every game of cards. Not making the player lose anything is definitely the right call, because the actual punishment for losing just becomes wasting your time.
        Tetra Master in Final Fantasy 9 had a mechanic like this. I did end up reloading my save all the time because I couldn’t accept permanently losing a one-of-a-kind card. I did have fun with the game but reloading saves was tedious.
    >That they are willing to lose the game
Yes u can but then I'll just kill u and loot ur dead body plus whole of your house(even though I can do that without killing u)
    Oh Gwent... Always bringing out the best of us.
They should have made this an option under “Gwent difficulty”. Would make it a true challenge to become the Gwent master
    Yes, and just so people dont get stuck in an infinite loop of losing, there'd be an option to buy your lost cards back (it'd have to be pretty expensive)
        Im always out of money in the Witcher, very realistic
            Do all the question marks in Skellige, takes a while but I made over 100k crowns just with them lmao
                sword glitch in Kaer Morhen go brrrr
                    Lol i forgot about that too
                        Enlighten me?
                            Basically. There’s a tower near Kaer Morhen where a skeleton has a relic. For some reason, the relic sword is able to respawn. So what you essentially do is pick up sword save game and fall off cliff, and reload save.
In my headcanon, this condition exists but my Geralt never had to give up any of his cards because he technically never lost a game of Gwent (reloading save)
    He's using Axii before every round to win and take the card. Geralt is a master swindler.
To any saying Geralt "never loses" in the story, remember that NPCs have quotes they say once you lose.
Meh.. axii if u lose the bet
    This makes sense LOL
This always killed me how nobody ever said that lol.  Everybody was just too happy to give their fire cards to geralt
Plot armour thickens
Ff VIII triple triad.

Lose your best cards when you lose.

Fight for hours to get them back.

Ugh.
    I was hoping to see someone mention FF8. That card game was a pain. The whole "losing certain cards on purpose to unlock others" was so annoying.
Just raise the stakes, the loser will get banished to the shadow realm
I suck so bad at Gwent, is there any good guides out there? I feel like I'm missing so much content by skipping them all
    Damn lots of comments about people sucking at Gwent! Sad! But now that I think about it I guess it can be pretty challenging early on. 

This guide seems pretty thorough?
https://www.vg247.com/2017/12/19/the-witcher-3-how-to-win-gwent-guide/
        I will give it some thought tomorrow when I play. Have I missed any main Gwent event quests after isle of the mists? Or are they all still available?
I always found that funny lol,
Haha so true
WinGwint(true)
Anyone knows if there is a mod for this? Either one that bets a random card, or one that you choose. It doesnt matter to me, I just think that would make playing gwent soo much more exciting! :D
Well there is always the power of save and load
    Well thither is at each moment the power of save and load

First playthrough I was actually afraid this was the case.
No just 2 coins 👍🏻
"No"

*Quick saves*

"Yes"
I absolutely didn't get the game so I just have to win it using console cheat WinGwint (# points) 💀💀💀💀💀
Guys I suck at gwent any advice

    Fail and try again technic
I wonder if this could’ve been done a little better. Like for example: state that Geralt values his gwent cards over any monetary amount. This means Geralt doesn’t get any money if he wins, just the card, but loses money if he loses.
Love that you win against their all monster deck that let's em pull out every monster card with the same name in their deck only for them to give you a 2 attack goblin card or so for a deck you do not have enough cards for
*ahem* This is why I love quicksave
Listen I cannot play Gwent for my life man
“Surreeee…..”

***Quietly presses F5***
I never thought of it that way😂😭

Not making the player lose anything is definitely the right call, because the actual punishment for losing just becomes wasting your time.
    Tetra Master in Final Fantasy 9 had a mechanic like this. I did end up reloading my save all the time because I couldn’t accept permanently losing a one-of-a-kind card. I did have fun with the game but reloading saves was tedious.
>That they are willing to lose the game
Oh Gwent... Always bringing out the best of us.
Yes, and just so people dont get stuck in an infinite loop of losing, there'd be an option to buy your lost cards back (it'd have to be pretty expensive)
    Im always out of money in the Witcher, very realistic
        Do all the question marks in Skellige, takes a while but I made over 100k crowns just with them lmao
            sword glitch in Kaer Morhen go brrrr
                Lol i forgot about that too
                    Enlighten me?
                        Basically. There’s a tower near Kaer Morhen where a skeleton has a relic. For some reason, the relic sword is able to respawn. So what you essentially do is pick up sword save game and fall off cliff, and reload save.
He's using Axii before every round to win and take the card. Geralt is a master swindler.
This makes sense LOL
I was hoping to see someone mention FF8. That card game was a pain. The whole "losing certain cards on purpose to unlock others" was so annoying.
Damn lots of comments about people sucking at Gwent! Sad! But now that I think about it I guess it can be pretty challenging early on. 

This guide seems pretty thorough?

    I will give it some thought tomorrow when I play. Have I missed any main Gwent event quests after isle of the mists? Or are they all still available?
Well thither is at each moment the power of save and load

Fail and try again technic
Yeah good luck doing that in the Skellige deck tournament in Blood & Wine
    I’ve just completed that quest and I felt so blessed that it autosaves between matches
        IT FUCKING WHAT?! Every time i play through the Witcher i do that quest, and everytime I've just made a manual save before the quest and loaded back to it. Now I learn that I don't have to cry my way through it every time I lose the last game
            Yes!! I lost my second match and was raging that I’d have to take my chances with the guy who wants my sword and then voila! Noticed a lovely checkpoint save after I’d beaten him
                It does fucking not auto save. Unless this is some console v pc bullshittery I lost that so many times and had to restart the whole fucking thing it’s not funny
                    Mine definitely auto saved on PS4. I was fuming because I lost the second match and it just reverted to the beginning of that rather than the whole quest
                        Autosaves on Xbox as well.
        Bruh, I didn't know this. I think I played the tournament for an hour or two, then accept my loss. Skellige deck is ass. Can't beat the dude with Nilfgard deck. So many spies 😂😂
    no reak need, skellige is mad overpowered
        I don’t know man the skellige deck fucking sucks.
            Skellige deck is the only deck capable of beating a NR spy deck. It’s just heavily dependent on card synergy.
                What about a Nilfgaardian spy deck? lol.
                    Ceres and a commander horn is an automatic 85  if you can get it. That and some decoy cards is all it really takes to beat nilfguard
                        I know what you need, but....    

1. You have to actually draw them, and if you don't, tough luck. Because you aren't getting anymore cards (unless you're able to decoy a spy).      

And 2. Even if you pull them, that might win you one round. If they play all their spies and give a round to you, you'll be screwed just based of pure numbers. They might have 14+ cards while you have 6.
                No my NR spy deck beats every deck including another NR spy deck
            then you don't know how to use it honestly
                That deck is entirely dependent on luck. If you don't get Cerys and berserkers and the fungus you are fucked
                    It’s not bad if you tailor your deck specifically for the person you’re against, it’s just not ideal for “one build beats all”. Even after winning the tournament, I immediately switched back to my Northern Realms deck lol
                    I had full northern realms spy deck before I started the DLC, and switched to skelig for the tournament. And sure drawing Cerys means you've pretty much guaranteed won the round, but that's still just one round you've won, and I found it very possible to win almost every single game I played on Skelig, even games I didn't draw Cerys on.
                    If you don’t draw your win conditions then you lose? I’d have never guessed.
                    I don't have any berserkers in my deck
                It takes a bit of luck, and then it's decent, but it has no spies. Beating the guy that uses the Nilfgaardian deck is really hard. You need decoys to take his spies and fight fire with fire.
        Northern Realms baby!
    Fuck Skellige deck I hate it so much
    When I read that I felt how fucking lucky I must've been for winning it on the first try. Think I had one game that was "close" but RNG is the game
    Gwent is easy bruv
Nah the real OG’s don’t lose.
A skill I learned playing Pazaak in KOTOR. If the AI cheats, why can't I?
Live. Gwent. Repeat.
What's new? LOL
The Gwent tournament makes you reload if you want to win it. I doubt anyone could win the tournament first time through.
    Yeah, I wont the 3 rounds on frist try but lost many time to the final guy and because gwent is many time about luck you would need to be extra lucky to win it first try
        Weird, because I found the final guy the easiest. He plays the monster deck which is very easy to counter so all it took was a biting frost and villentretenmerth in quick succession, and his entire row was cleaned out lmao 

I did have some trouble with Sasha though. She plays like most irl players do - spamming the shit out of spies and medics, only for more spies. By the end of the game, I had literally drawn my entire Nilfgaardian deck of 28 cards.
            Sometimes the monster deck NPCs get a shit hand (=no cards that call reinforcements) but you won't know it until you have used up all your other cards besides biting frost and the scorch dragon guy while waiting for their good stuff to come up. Then you have to either hold and lose the round or use them and be left with like a single card on the next round. Then it's all luck which card the NPC gets to keep with their faction passive.

And sometimes you just don't get biting frost or scorch dragon guy at all. It happens.
            My monster deck counter strategy was spamming my spies and then just trying to draw out as many of their cards as possible and take the L on the first round and then sweep the next rounds because they have no cards. Found the weather cards of limited use so they just take up deck/hand space for spies, medics, and decoys.
                Yup, I always love when they play a muster card, and their card count drops by 3 or 4.  Nice to get them from your deck, but that's a big disadvantage if it plays them from your hand.
                if you play against monsters without biting frost idk what to say
    Yes, but you do not loose any of your cards, you can still finish the quest (in most cases)

Gwent tournament was ok, until that damned fist-fight out of nowhere appeared. That made me reload game more than 20x. And Gerald got killed for real with fists.
        But fist fights are piss easy. All you have to do is open up some distance between you and your opponent, forcing them to advance and, while they swing a heavy blow, simply parry and counterattack.
            Well, I know now. Before I have avoided fights as much as posible, didn't even know I can dodge quickly into directions. So I got stuck by learning to fist-fight with one of the hardest oponents. Also in few quest fights before didn't have such fatal consequences as death and game over.
                So you just completely bypassed the tutorial fights the game gives you to hold your hand with combat? I don’t see how you could not know about dodging otherwise. Moreover, there’s a tutorial fistfight in white orchard to make sure you’re competent - did you do that?
                    I don't remember. It is hard to keep in mind tutorial from 2-3 months ago telling about keybind that isn't used for anything else. I won few fights in main quest, but these were quite easy to do without any strategy.
        >Gwent tournament was ok, until that damned fist-fight out of nowhere appeared. That made me reload game more than 20x. And Gerald got killed for real with fists.

This! His scoia'tael deck was a piece of cake and I was almost laughing, but then he started throwing punches. Even worse, I had taken the quest when I was around 8 levels below recommended so that wasn't very fun.
            And very unexpected with fatal consequences. I have barely won against Baron and avoided all fist fights after. When this fight appeared, I didn't even knew I was able to dodge in directions. 
After many tries, I managed to win and It also gave me confidence to try other fist fights. 
If I think about it, if you avoid all minigames like Gwent, fist fights or horce races, you will always learn these the hard way later.
                Do I really have to play gwent? I'm ln my first playthrough, but that's boring for me, I don't wanna do any of that lol, I haven't even gotten the first important cards from the first gwent quest
                    I have found it boring too at start, but after I got better cards, I like it a lot now. Winning is geat!  :)  It is good to have some decent deck, in few quests, you will play Gwent and also in some you will get quite different outcome and consequences if you win/loose. Also Gwent quests in journal will give you xp and rare cards.
                        So how much does the AI challenge you?
                            I have played at normal dificulty. Some people can be quite challenge, especialy at Gwent tournament, but I quite liked the way that you first need to play and see what kind of deck opponent has and build your deck to counter it, refining your strategy.. Once you have decent deck, you can win around 85% games on first try.
            I'm sorry what's this levels thing everyone keeps talking about.
        Such a long load time as well! So annoying!
    I won the gwent tournament in Toussant, but i lost the Novigrad one, it seems i can still get the cards i just have a harder time.
        I was able to win both the Toussant and Novigrad tournaments my first try.  The one I lost was the Wedding one in Hearts of Stone where you have to end up wearing the donkey ears.
    Definitely remember beating io first try
    I actually did win every game first time but I already had a very good deck at that time
    I was lucky, I won first try
    In my second playthrough I actually won the whole thing without savescumming. I used my foltest siege deck and somehow won lol.

I'm not saying I'm super skilled, but lady luck was on my side.
    I won it my first and only time with no difficulty
Oh you were bitten by a wild dog? Better take  two weeks to recover from the wound and the mild infection.

>Gwent tournament was ok, until that damned fist-fight out of nowhere appeared. That made me reload game more than 20x. And Gerald got killed for real with fists.

This! His scoia'tael deck was a piece of cake and I was almost laughing, but then he started throwing punches. Even worse, I had taken the quest when I was around 8 levels below recommended so that wasn't very fun.
    And very unexpected with fatal consequences. I have barely won against Baron and avoided all fist fights after. When this fight appeared, I didn't even knew I was able to dodge in directions. 
After many tries, I managed to win and It also gave me confidence to try other fist fights. 
If I think about it, if you avoid all minigames like Gwent, fist fights or horce races, you will always learn these the hard way later.
        Do I really have to play gwent? I'm ln my first playthrough, but that's boring for me, I don't wanna do any of that lol, I haven't even gotten the first important cards from the first gwent quest
            I have found it boring too at start, but after I got better cards, I like it a lot now. Winning is geat!  :)  It is good to have some decent deck, in few quests, you will play Gwent and also in some you will get quite different outcome and consequences if you win/loose. Also Gwent quests in journal will give you xp and rare cards.
                So how much does the AI challenge you?
                    I have played at normal dificulty. Some people can be quite challenge, especialy at Gwent tournament, but I quite liked the way that you first need to play and see what kind of deck opponent has and build your deck to counter it, refining your strategy.. Once you have decent deck, you can win around 85% games on first try.
    I'm sorry what's this levels thing everyone keeps talking about.
Such a long load time as well! So annoying!
I was able to win both the Toussant and Novigrad tournaments my first try.  The one I lost was the Wedding one in Hearts of Stone where you have to end up wearing the donkey ears.
sword glitch in Kaer Morhen go brrrr
    Lol i forgot about that too
        Enlighten me?
            Basically. There’s a tower near Kaer Morhen where a skeleton has a relic. For some reason, the relic sword is able to respawn. So what you essentially do is pick up sword save game and fall off cliff, and reload save.
Yes!! I lost my second match and was raging that I’d have to take my chances with the guy who wants my sword and then voila! Noticed a lovely checkpoint save after I’d beaten him
    It does fucking not auto save. Unless this is some console v pc bullshittery I lost that so many times and had to restart the whole fucking thing it’s not funny
        Mine definitely auto saved on PS4. I was fuming because I lost the second match and it just reverted to the beginning of that rather than the whole quest
            Autosaves on Xbox as well.
Skellige deck is the only deck capable of beating a NR spy deck. It’s just heavily dependent on card synergy.
    What about a Nilfgaardian spy deck? lol.
        Ceres and a commander horn is an automatic 85  if you can get it. That and some decoy cards is all it really takes to beat nilfguard
            I know what you need, but....    

1. You have to actually draw them, and if you don't, tough luck. Because you aren't getting anymore cards (unless you're able to decoy a spy).      

And 2. Even if you pull them, that might win you one round. If they play all their spies and give a round to you, you'll be screwed just based of pure numbers. They might have 14+ cards while you have 6.
    No my NR spy deck beats every deck including another NR spy deck
then you don't know how to use it honestly
    That deck is entirely dependent on luck. If you don't get Cerys and berserkers and the fungus you are fucked
        It’s not bad if you tailor your deck specifically for the person you’re against, it’s just not ideal for “one build beats all”. Even after winning the tournament, I immediately switched back to my Northern Realms deck lol
        I had full northern realms spy deck before I started the DLC, and switched to skelig for the tournament. And sure drawing Cerys means you've pretty much guaranteed won the round, but that's still just one round you've won, and I found it very possible to win almost every single game I played on Skelig, even games I didn't draw Cerys on.
        If you don’t draw your win conditions then you lose? I’d have never guessed.
        I don't have any berserkers in my deck
    It takes a bit of luck, and then it's decent, but it has no spies. Beating the guy that uses the Nilfgaardian deck is really hard. You need decoys to take his spies and fight fire with fire.
Sometimes the monster deck NPCs get a shit hand (=no cards that call reinforcements) but you won't know it until you have used up all your other cards besides biting frost and the scorch dragon guy while waiting for their good stuff to come up. Then you have to either hold and lose the round or use them and be left with like a single card on the next round. Then it's all luck which card the NPC gets to keep with their faction passive.

And sometimes you just don't get biting frost or scorch dragon guy at all. It happens.
My monster deck counter strategy was spamming my spies and then just trying to draw out as many of their cards as possible and take the L on the first round and then sweep the next rounds because they have no cards. Found the weather cards of limited use so they just take up deck/hand space for spies, medics, and decoys.
    Yup, I always love when they play a muster card, and their card count drops by 3 or 4.  Nice to get them from your deck, but that's a big disadvantage if it plays them from your hand.
    if you play against monsters without biting frost idk what to say
Well, I know now. Before I have avoided fights as much as posible, didn't even know I can dodge quickly into directions. So I got stuck by learning to fist-fight with one of the hardest oponents. Also in few quest fights before didn't have such fatal consequences as death and game over.
    So you just completely bypassed the tutorial fights the game gives you to hold your hand with combat? I don’t see how you could not know about dodging otherwise. Moreover, there’s a tutorial fistfight in white orchard to make sure you’re competent - did you do that?
